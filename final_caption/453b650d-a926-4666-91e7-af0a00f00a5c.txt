1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,640
And let me. Let me introduce you and then students.

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:15,410
Dr. BIDDINGER would actually like an introduction for all of you, so we'll just do, like, a super, super brief one, so.

3
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:25,670
Okay. All right. Dr. Paul BIDDINGER is the chief preparedness and continuity officer at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.

4
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:32,749
He also holds the A.L. Preston Pino M.P.H. Endowed Chair in Emergency Preparedness and is also

5
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:39,350
the director of the Center for Disaster Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital Energy H.

6
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:44,419
Dr. BIDDINGER. Additionally serves as the Director of Emergency Preparedness, Research,

7
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:49,940
Evaluation and Practice or E prep program at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public

8
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:54,260
Health and holds an appointment at the Harvard Medical School and at the Chan School.

9
00:00:54,620 --> 00:01:00,169
He also serves as a medical officer for the Massachusetts One Disaster Medical Assistance Team,

10
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:06,440
Demat in the National Disaster Medical System for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

11
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:12,049
He's also an active researcher in the field of emergent emergency preparedness and has

12
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:16,820
lectured nationally internationally on topics on preparedness and disaster medicine.

13
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:20,390
He's authored numerous articles, including some with me,

14
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:27,260
and book chapters on multiple topics related to disaster medicine and emergency medical operations,

15
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:33,980
and has responded to numerous prior events, including Hurricane Katrina, Superstorm Sandy,

16
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:40,490
the Boston Marathon bombings, the Nepal earthquakes, many others, including COVID 19.

17
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:45,170
So he got his undergrad in international relations at Princeton University,

18
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:52,040
attended medical school at Vanderbilt University, and completed his residency training in emergency medicine at Harvard.

19
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:57,240
And we are so privileged to have such an expert here today.

20
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:04,430
He's very busy, but I delightfully made time and was somehow available for this guest lecture.

21
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:14,030
So welcome. Dr. BIDDINGER. And then we'll just quickly go around and just say your name and like the program you're in.

22
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:19,190
So I'll just call up folks. So Burnley. Hello?

23
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:25,030
Yes, my name is Burnley. I'm a master's in public health student and I'm in the Environmental Health Sciences Program.

24
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:29,790
So thank you, Abigail. Hello.

25
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:33,719
I'm Abby. I'm a dual amp amp students.

26
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:38,580
I'm at the Ford School of Public Policy and here at the School of Public Health and Health Management and Policy.

27
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,420
Huddah. Hi, I'm Huda Bashir.

28
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:49,050
I'm also a dual master's student in public health in general epidemiology and then doing an MPP and public policy as well.

29
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,590
Thank you. Saw you. Hi.

30
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:57,610
My name is Sahil. I'm an Amazon in Environmental Health Sciences.

31
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:05,320
Adrianna Hi, my name is Adrianna Rojas, and I'm a second year global health epidemiology student.

32
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:10,459
Sweaty. Hi.

33
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:15,830
My name is Swati. I'm a second year m.p.h. student in the Environmental Health Sciences Department.

34
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:20,520
Thank you, page. Hi.

35
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,970
My name's Paige. I'm also a second year global health Abbott student.

36
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:30,200
It's great. I came. Hi.

37
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:39,850
My name is Kang. I am a second year environmental health student at the great Sarah.

38
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:45,570
I am Sarah. I am a second year general student as well.

39
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:50,040
Great. Lexi. Hi.

40
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,520
I'm Lexi. I'm a second year general epidemiology student.

41
00:03:54,420 --> 00:04:01,040
And Chloe. You need a guy in a second year.

42
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,040
I'm a student in Environmental Health Sciences.

43
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:12,300
Great. I think I got everybody. So with that, you should have screen sharing capabilities, so I'll let you take it away.

44
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:15,870
Hopefully. Yeah, I can do that. So.

45
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:22,040
Good morning to everybody. I know it's an hour earlier and for many of you anyway, had enough for everybody.

46
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:26,120
But we're on the East Coast time and it's just time. Yeah, yeah. Never mind then.

47
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:32,570
Good. I'm glad you all got the extra sleep. So I'm Paul BIDDINGER, as Aurora said, and it's really nice to meet everybody.

48
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:38,180
This I will try and keep informal but of course on Zoom that's really hard.

49
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:45,320
So you know you can definitely raise your hand but in case I don't see it, just feel free to just interrupt me and jump in if you guys have questions.

50
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:51,379
This is a painfully acronym laden world that I'm going to do my best to try and navigate with you,

51
00:04:51,380 --> 00:05:02,720
but I'm going to try and untie the complexity of how the U.S. federal system responds to public health emergencies.

52
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:13,370
And as you're going to see, it's painfully complicated with a lot of overlap and some some lack of clarity in who does what,

53
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:20,450
which actually is kind of part of the problem. And I'll show you what it looks like now and kind of offers and commentary along the way.

54
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:28,010
But I will do my very best. I'm going to show you a bunch of organizational charts, and that clearly is not that much fun to look at.

55
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:32,720
It's kind of dry and Sara but I'm going to try and highlight why it matters.

56
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:39,160
And then after we remain at least, who are the big agency players, what does the governmental structure look like?

57
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:44,179
Well, I'm going to try and tie that back to what are the core public health functions in emergency response overall.

58
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:49,549
So hopefully make this a little more real as we talk about the real things that have to happen during disasters.

59
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:52,280
But lots to do in the next 90 minutes.

60
00:05:52,550 --> 00:06:00,230
Like I say, please completely feel free to interrupt me at any point if you want to either make a comment or ask the question as we go.

61
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:08,999
So just to to level set, let's let's kind of talk about what what we're talking about the response systems for it.

62
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,950
And in a sense, it's actually kind of anything.

63
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:19,680
So anything that interrupts public health services or adversely affects human health is kind of what's on the table.

64
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:28,710
So it could be weather events, it could be manmade events like terror attacks or industrial disasters.

65
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:33,270
Obviously, it could be infectious disease outbreaks. It's really kind of anything.

66
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:41,100
And I'm it's ironic to me that the the best sort of common definition from public

67
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:44,700
about a public health emergency comes from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

68
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:48,959
And as some of you may already be aware, and I'll go into a bit more detail,

69
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,460
the second FEMA actually is not a medical organization, does not have health care expertize.

70
00:06:53,460 --> 00:07:00,900
And so I find it kind of strange that they're the ones that have the better definition out there that people commonly used, because honestly,

71
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:08,220
most all of the public health emergency response is outside of FEMA doesn't does not have to do with FEMA and what they do.

72
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:16,000
But for a little bit, we're going to stay within the FEMA world because they're the ones that actually set a lot of these definitions.

73
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:23,530
If you look at overall the United States government's effort to to be prepared.

74
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:29,919
Most of the systems, or at least the superstructure, is, in fact, defined by FEMA.

75
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:36,790
And as I'll say now and show you again in a second, FEMA is is a part of the Department of Homeland Security.

76
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:40,990
So, again, you may know within the U.S. government, we have the executive,

77
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:44,950
the president, and then there are departments, there are cabinet level positions.

78
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:51,640
And after Hurricane Katrina, the Department of Homeland Security was created because there were well,

79
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:56,170
I mean, actually, technically, departmental security was created after 911.

80
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,910
After Katrina, it was reorganized because of the problems of that response.

81
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:04,300
But now FEMA lives within the Department of Homeland Security,

82
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:10,089
and they really set a lot of the definitions and kind of the superstructure that the rest

83
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:16,000
of the federal government operates in to be able to both plan for and respond to disasters.

84
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:20,300
So the U.S. government has a formal national preparedness goal.

85
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,470
You can see it here on the on the slide in round in front of you.

86
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:29,410
And I would point out, I think you guys hopefully have already heard this or know about it,

87
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:35,300
but there there are the classic phases of emergency management which are prevention.

88
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,890
This very clearly resonates with those that are public health students.

89
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:43,450
It's always better to prevent disease than to treat disease. The same is true in emergency management.

90
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:47,830
Better to prevent events than than to respond to them.

91
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,690
Protect against is a lot like mitigate and so I've never understood why we say

92
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:56,860
protect against to mitigate but it's basically to harden our infrastructure,

93
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:01,180
to limit the damage, to limit the magnitude of disasters when they happen.

94
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:05,890
Respond to of course, we have to have systems that effectively respond to disaster.

95
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:14,349
And then recovery is really, really, really important and usually gets kind of minimal time in most people's planning and most people's discussions.

96
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:19,550
But recovery can actually be the longest phase of a disaster that you see, you know,

97
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:25,660
where there are still recovery efforts going on these days from Hurricane Katrina, certainly from Superstorm Sandy.

98
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:29,950
And it'll take us years, if not decades, to recover from from the pandemic.

99
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:37,569
So, again, prevention mitigation response recovery are a classic four elements of emergency management.

100
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:41,320
And they are represented here in the national treasury to stall.

101
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:47,900
The government clearly loves to bureaucratized everything.

102
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:55,040
And so they call these things mission areas. And again, in my mind, protection and mitigation are very, very, very similar.

103
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:05,030
But in the way the government describes them, protection is more hardening and mitigation is more limiting damage.

104
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,450
But but I think those two are pretty much on a continuum.

105
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:17,330
Prevention is, again, do what you can to stop the events or, you know, plan to to avoid the events in different circumstances.

106
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,850
Response and recovery are pretty, pretty self-evident.

107
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:28,620
So again, we're in the bar and I promise we'll get out of some of this bureaucracy once we're done with all the the organizational charts.

108
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:34,940
But the national preparedness system then breaks up what everybody should be doing.

109
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:38,100
This is the federal government. This is state governments, this is local government.

110
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:43,050
This is health care, this is law enforcement, this is utilities.

111
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:55,440
Everybody ideally follows these six steps in their approach to being prepared for disasters and and again,

112
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,880
preventing, mitigating, responding and recovery.

113
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:06,690
So the first is risk assessment. And again, I apologize if maybe Arauz already covered this or other lectures discussed to you,

114
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:11,220
but I can't underscore enough how foundational risk assessment is.

115
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:16,620
You can't create a good plan if you don't know what you're planning for.

116
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:22,110
You have to know what the threats are that you're facing. You have to be able to look at your risks.

117
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:27,240
And and if your assessment of risks is off, then your plans will be off.

118
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:35,909
And so it really gets, I think, insufficient attention in the real world among emergency managers.

119
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:39,569
But certainly I think even in academics about how we look at risk assessments.

120
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:45,660
And, you know, one thing that I talk a lot about in other venues is risk assessment for climate change.

121
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:52,530
I think it's actually really hard to get good data on how climate is affecting your community.

122
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:59,700
And there are a lot of people planning for weather related hazards using historical data.

123
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,139
So they look at how hot it's been in the past. They look at what the flooding has been in the past.

124
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:10,590
They look at wind speeds. And, you know, as, you know, climate, climate change is completely turning those things upside down.

125
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,549
And so people are using historical data in their risk assessments.

126
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:19,260
And what that means is that their risk assessments do not properly look at their future flooding risk,

127
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:24,600
their future heat risks, their wind speed risks, and therefore, they're not as prepared as they need to be.

128
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:31,620
So so risk assessment is absolutely critical. The other little thing I'll say about risk assessment before I move on is,

129
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:36,780
is I think you probably all know, you know, we we humans are pretty lousy at risk assessment.

130
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:44,610
You know, it's kind of the classic reason why people sometimes hate to fly but don't mind driving 100 miles an hour down the highway is that,

131
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:51,510
you know, there are lots of things that are not about the actual risk, that influence how you perceive the risk and how you make your choices.

132
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:56,910
In the emergency management world, there are three key components of risk.

133
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,530
One is the probability of the events. How likely is the event to happen?

134
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:06,390
Two is the consequence of the event. So how severe is it when it happens?

135
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:11,370
And three is How ready are you for the event if it were to happen?

136
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,200
And naturally I think different people are wired in different ways.

137
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,040
Some people are really probability focused.

138
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:22,440
They want to prepare for those things that are really likely and if something is really unlikely, they don't much want to prepare for it.

139
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:27,450
Other people are more wired for consequence. They want to really prepare for the catastrophic thing.

140
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:31,560
And if something is not going to be so catastrophic, it doesn't rank as finely on their list.

141
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:36,660
And a lot of folks just don't really think about their existing readiness.

142
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:41,550
When they look at how they assess risk, they really are more focused on probability or consequence.

143
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:52,170
If you're going to look at risk, you really need to look at all three of those variables and you need to put together a a very clear headed,

144
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:58,919
unbiased assessment of what your risks are if you're going to do all the rest of the work on this chart in the hospital world.

145
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,740
So again, I work on health care system. Emergency preparedness.

146
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:06,750
Hospitals are required to do something called a hazard vulnerability analysis every single year in a VA.

147
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:13,320
And you have to take these three elements of probability, consequence and existing readiness,

148
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,949
and you create a spreadsheet with all of the hazards you can think of.

149
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:22,229
And so we do an EPA that has flooding and has power outage and has failure, failure, excuse me,

150
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:30,420
of the electronic health record and terrorist attack and pandemic and, you know, snowstorm, things that are completely dissimilar hazards.

151
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:35,639
But by breaking each hazard down into those three elements of probability,

152
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:41,520
consequence and existing readiness scoring them, you can come up with a relative risk score.

153
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:48,000
And actually every single year we use those risk assessments to determine what we're working on for the year, what our priority projects are.

154
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:50,969
And I know I spent a lot of time talking about risk,

155
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:57,390
but it is fundamental to being prepared that you have the best possible assessment of of your risk.

156
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:02,490
Next comes capability requirements. What does it take to respond to those risks?

157
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,660
What do you need in terms of antibiotics?

158
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:10,770
What do you need in terms of mass distribution capability for public health countermeasures?

159
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:14,880
What do you need for hospital bed capacity? What do you need for X?

160
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:20,820
You got to figure out what you need. Often you don't have enough of what you need.

161
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:24,629
And so you need to build those capacity. Capability, excuse me. Need to do more training.

162
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:28,080
You need to find surge strategies. You need to do better planning.

163
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:34,049
And all that planning is the next step so that you know what you're shooting for.

164
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:41,310
That's estimating the capabilities. You find a way to plan to build those capacities and ideally are capabilities, and then you sustain them.

165
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:47,050
One of the challenges is that it's pretty common to create plans that are never validated

166
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:51,180
and people come up with all sorts of medical countermeasure distribution strategies.

167
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:55,440
So so pre-COVID, lots and lots of health departments across country said, oh yeah,

168
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,889
we can do X number of vaccinations in two weeks and four weeks and whatever.

169
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:02,190
And and they they really had never tested those plans.

170
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:06,719
And I think we saw a lot of health jurisdictions around the country not be able to fulfill their vaccination

171
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:12,150
requirements early in the pandemic because they had not validated the capabilities that they had planned for.

172
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,610
So in a true preparedness system, you don't just plan, but you actually test those plans.

173
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:21,780
You see what works, you see what doesn't work, and then you address the gaps.

174
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:27,240
There's never been a good emergency preparedness exercise that doesn't find gaps and problems,

175
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:31,140
and that's okay because we're always trying to get better.

176
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:40,410
But once you test your systems, then you go back and kind of go through this cycle all over again and update your plans.

177
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:46,829
You know, the slide lists, these things kind of in a linear fashion, like you go step one and you end down at the bottom of the slide.

178
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:53,730
But really this is much more iterative. This is really kind of circular that you do this and then you rinse and repeat and you do it all over again.

179
00:16:56,550 --> 00:17:01,920
So the government does have these things called national planning frameworks,

180
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:11,030
and we're still in the bureaucrat bureaucratic world here for a bit to try and support how you do those things in each of the phases of response.

181
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:19,680
So there's protection, there's response, there's mitigation, there's recovery, and there's a national framework for each one of those mission areas.

182
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:27,620
To give you an example. Look, you know, we can drill down a little bit on the national response framework because I think,

183
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:31,640
you know, most time when people think about emergency management, they think about response.

184
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,569
And there is something called the National Response Framework.

185
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:44,930
And it is an overarching vision of how everybody fits together from the state to the federal to the local and kind of everything in between.

186
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:51,200
And so when you when you hear about kind of who does what or how are we supposed to all fit together?

187
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:55,880
The overarching concept is called the National Response Framework.

188
00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:03,440
The national response framework is supposed to use the R does use the National Incident Management System and Aurora.

189
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,340
So let me just ask you, if folks heard about Nims or about ISIS?

190
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:08,630
Not yet. Okay.

191
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:19,790
So so the NIMS is a bit of a bureaucratic structure, but but it takes incident command systems you've probably heard of in surveillance systems.

192
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:25,429
But these are the command and control, the leadership structures of all the different groups that that respond in

193
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:29,840
disaster and tells them how they're supposed to integrate and weave together.

194
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:38,419
You'll learn more about the incident command system, but basically everybody is supposed to use it during a disaster.

195
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:43,549
So hospitals, my own hospital system uses the incident command system during disasters.

196
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:47,270
And so we have an incident commander, we have a whole command leadership team,

197
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:56,270
and it takes a really complex matrixed organization and kind of streamlines it much more of kind of a it's not the best analogy,

198
00:18:56,270 --> 00:19:01,760
but a military like reporting structure where there's one general in charge and the colonels report to the general and the,

199
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:08,180
you know, majors report to the colonel. And it sort of streamlines how decisions are made and how actions are taken during a disaster.

200
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:14,420
That's the inside command system to make people work faster, better together within organizations.

201
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:21,049
But it also uses very standardized terminology. So if you use the incident command system and you use the national incident management system,

202
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:24,770
you actually have to have an incident commander at the top of your organization.

203
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:29,179
You have to have an operations chief who runs the operations of your organization.

204
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:35,660
And operations chief in health care oversees the clinical care and operations, chief in firefighting, overseas,

205
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:41,600
life safety and firefighting in an operations chief in the police department oversees law enforcement.

206
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:47,120
And so by using common terms and by using sort of a common organizational structure,

207
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:53,120
it's easier to weave together organizations from either different levels at the local and state

208
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:58,010
or state and federal or across communities where they don't necessarily normally work together.

209
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:06,260
Within the national response framework, people are supposed to work to develop whole community plans.

210
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:12,890
And so the idea is, is that, you know, we want to protect the entire population.

211
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:18,560
The day to day ways in which we do that are pretty fragmented.

212
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:24,080
Law enforcement does law enforcement things, but the fire department does fire department things.

213
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:30,350
And, you know, many communities spread spread across smaller jurisdictions like cities and towns.

214
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:35,930
And so trying to get all of those people across geographic or governmental boundaries to work together is hard.

215
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:43,760
I will say it's even harder on the health care side. You know, almost all of the health care infrastructure in the United States is private.

216
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:51,410
And there's really very little incentive for hospitals to work together on emergency preparedness because they're kind of just struggling, too,

217
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:58,879
to take care of the population inside their hospital walls and creating a whole of community health response plans is really tricky,

218
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,340
and we'll get into that as we go through this time.

219
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:08,840
But ideally in the national response framework, you're supposed to have the municipal jurisdictions, non-governmental organizations,

220
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:15,950
including private sector organizations like hospitals and Health Care, plan to build capabilities to figure out how to respond.

221
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:23,140
And the way that we do that is in this thing called emergency support functions, that is an important term for you to remember.

222
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:25,140
And I'm going to show you a little bit more on the next slide.

223
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:35,490
But basically the the framework breaks the whole of community response down into 15 different sectors so that no matter who you are or what you do,

224
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:42,510
you know what ESF emergency support function you fit into and the entire national response is,

225
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:48,000
generally speaking, guided by that ESF response, at least at the from the federal side.

226
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:52,480
So these are the 15 safes.

227
00:21:53,110 --> 00:22:01,360
And underneath each one, you can see at the federal level which federal agency your department is is in the lead for for that ESF.

228
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:10,929
I won't read them all to you, obviously, but the most important one for I think everybody here is is have a so everything that is public health and

229
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:18,010
medical belongs in SFA as somebody who kind of works both in the public health and in the medical sphere.

230
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:21,100
I'll tell you that I am particularly challenged, even still,

231
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:26,020
by the fact that public health and medical are lumped in together in the SFA because they're really different.

232
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:30,910
And I think one of the greatest challenges we have faced for a long time, we certainly faced throughout COVID,

233
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:37,990
is the fact that the public health infrastructure doesn't necessarily understand clinical care or the medical care system.

234
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:45,610
And there's a lot of challenges when you put them in charge of leading it because they don't necessarily have the right expertize,

235
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:53,470
even if they have governmental authority to do this. So so they've lumped in two things that are pretty tricky to put together, but it is what it is.

236
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,030
This is what happens.

237
00:22:55,030 --> 00:23:01,929
Also, I think when you let you know, FEMA and public safety folks kind of guide what they think public health and medical should look like.

238
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:05,049
But it is it is the national system and I don't think it will be changed.

239
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:12,560
I what I'm so but so when you talk about. The Organization of Public Health and Health Care Response.

240
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:20,440
Everything falls into SFA eight. It's term you should know. One other thing it's relevant for for some of you is mass care.

241
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:23,899
So when you do mass sheltering, that is ESF six.

242
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:30,170
That's a closely related one. When you see events like Katrina or Sandy or others where there's a lot of displaced,

243
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:36,650
displaced populations inside the U.S., ESF sex is the one that's most responsible for creating that emergency sheltering.

244
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:41,000
For those of you that are environmental health students, because I know a lot of you have interest,

245
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:46,320
I will point out that there are a couple of different ways environmental health docs in here.

246
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:51,139
Certainly the hazardous materials response led by the EPA under is often.

247
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:56,420
But ESF 11 plays a role as a as does ESF.

248
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:02,120
So this graphic, I think,

249
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:10,670
does a somewhat nice job of showing how unbelievably complicated it is and how sort of how many steps there are to go through a disaster.

250
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:15,739
Following the Master National Disaster Framework, we'll try and break it down.

251
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:19,280
And this will be maybe a little clearer by the time we're done with everything, but.

252
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:25,379
There's a ton of bureaucracy, unfortunately, that disaster world. Some of it is good.

253
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,880
A lot of it is not necessarily so good.

254
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:35,400
But I will say that if you start on this sort of upper left part of the oval where it says disaster occurs, you'll know that it starts locally.

255
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:42,660
And it is a really important concept to remember that disasters do, generally speaking, start locally,

256
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:48,450
whether it's a mass shooting event, whether it's a hurricane, whether it's a tornado, whether it's a wildfire.

257
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:52,140
You know, there are disaster scenarios for every single part of this country.

258
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,409
Most of them, maybe with the exception of the way the pandemic, of course, has been rolling out.

259
00:24:57,410 --> 00:24:58,910
But most of them start locally.

260
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:08,660
And there's kind of a famous phrase in emergency management says all disasters are local, and no matter how big it gets, it's still local.

261
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:15,980
And a lot of that is because the initial response of the continuing response does depend on the capabilities of the local system,

262
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:25,010
local first responders. So fire, police, EMS. Ideally, health care and public health are also involved in that.

263
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:33,380
Start responding and then escalate. Depends on where you are in the country as to whether counties get involved or some sort of regional structure.

264
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:39,379
Here in Massachusetts, where I am. We really don't have much of a county system, which is a bit of a challenge.

265
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:42,830
We have a very hyper local system where what's called a home rule state.

266
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:48,560
So we have 351 cities and towns that basically have their own autonomy working independently.

267
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:55,700
That's challenging. The next level of authority, typically above the local level is the is the state level.

268
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,200
And most states require the governor to formally declare a disaster,

269
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:06,739
either to allow certain financial responsibilities that the governor can now spend money in a

270
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:12,710
certain way or can can waive regulatory authority in a certain way to to respond to the disaster.

271
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,990
States can work together through something called mutual aid.

272
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:23,899
There's a national system called EMAC, which is the Emergency Management Assistance Compacts.

273
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:30,770
And it's a it's a contract among all 50 states plus 12 territories to be able to share resources.

274
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:34,639
And so they can share law enforcement resources.

275
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:41,990
They can share public works like, you know, dump trucks or end loaders during some of the terrible snowstorms back in 20 1415.

276
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:48,050
Here, we shared snowplows between states. But but it's a it's a contractual system that lets states help one another.

277
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:51,950
But oftentimes, things get bigger than what the state can do.

278
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:56,840
And then the governor has to formally request assistance from the federal government.

279
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:04,850
FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Is a coordinating body, but not actually a response body.

280
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:10,639
And I think that sometimes folks don't quite understand that FEMA doesn't do much itself directly.

281
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:15,920
It mostly coordinates across those 15 assets to let the different agencies come and support.

282
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,590
The president has to be the one who formally approves a federal disaster declaration.

283
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:25,070
And it's an incredibly important step.

284
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:35,860
Once there's a federal declaration of disaster, the US government, the Federal Government is now on the hook for 70% of disaster response costs.

285
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:44,110
And so it is a very, very big step financially to support local businesses, to support state governments.

286
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:50,190
And it's why you often see in the news why it's relevant that the president declared a disaster.

287
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:56,350
It allows all of a sudden, all of those years of agencies I showed you on the previous slide to do what they what they need to do.

288
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:00,880
But a lot of that can't happen if there is not a declared disaster.

289
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:09,900
Just Oh, sorry, Yahoo! Took I had a question about the president declaring a disaster.

290
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:14,400
And you think that they're responsible for 70% of the disaster costs?

291
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:18,800
Is that like remember how you had said there were like the five stages, right?

292
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:24,120
There's like the immediate spot, like, is that 70% of the five stages or not?

293
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:31,229
And I ask because including things like mitigation, we allocated 20,000,000 billion to Puerto Rico,

294
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:35,290
which is nowhere near 70% of the costs that are needed.

295
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:38,610
Yeah. No. So 100%. That's a phenomenally good question.

296
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:44,480
No. Is generally speaking, only response costs and then some recovery costs.

297
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:49,050
So planning and mitigation are not eligible typically for or reimbursement.

298
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:56,189
And to your your other point, it is there it is FEMA's approved costs.

299
00:28:56,190 --> 00:29:00,510
And so often it goes only to.

300
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:06,030
State governments or territorial governments.

301
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:15,299
It goes to public safety organizations and certain nonprofit organizations so households can get FEMA assistance.

302
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:21,870
You've seen people get shelter and some other reimbursement. But generally speaking, for profit businesses rarely get reimbursement as well.

303
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:27,360
So it's not into the whole community. Obviously, as you point out, you know, Puerto Rico sustained so much more damage than that.

304
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:31,590
But but but it's the approved costs from the government.

305
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:35,680
It definitely does not make a community whole or even 70% whole.

306
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,040
Yeah. Um.

307
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:42,780
All right. So, yeah, please do keep it up.

308
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:47,880
And that was a really good question. The one thing just for a term of art here is that.

309
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:56,290
The the legal authority by which the president declares a disaster comes under something called the Stafford Act.

310
00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:03,450
And so you'll hear people talk about a Stafford Act declaration. And that's that's what allows the federal government to do its disaster response.

311
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:07,450
And just because all the time people say, oh, you know, did it get a Stafford act?

312
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:15,100
It not going to Stafford Act knowing that term is sort of synonymous ring federal disaster declaration is really important.

313
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:22,459
Once there is a federal disaster declaration that again, a whole bunch of bureaucracy kicks into place.

314
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:24,680
And there are federal coordinating officers.

315
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:30,889
They set up a joint field office which coordinates among those ESFS, and they have emergency response teams.

316
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:39,200
And often it is both federal and state, if not also local folks that that are kind of all coordinated under that system.

317
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:45,950
Most all states do use ESF as well.

318
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:50,870
Not every state uses the ESF, the all federal government response does.

319
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:54,949
But that way people kind of coordinate knowing what ESF eight does.

320
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:58,250
What is that six does, but ESF ten does, etc.

321
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:07,150
So if we're in the of a world, the question is who are the big federal ESF players?

322
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:13,690
Is they excuse me and then how do we break that down? I would expect everyone knows the CDC.

323
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:20,080
It's, you know, the nation's public health enterprise will go in a little more detail, the CDC in a second.

324
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:26,739
But, you know, some of you may or may not know that really the CDC does not have any health care operations or health care expertize,

325
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:36,310
particularly within it as as an agency. It is much more about public health, infectious disease and overall community health as part of it.

326
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:44,290
So coming back to Katrina, recognizing that the overall health response to Hurricane Katrina was pretty terrible,

327
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:52,990
the federal government created something called ASPER that up until earlier this year was the Assistant Secretary for preparedness and response.

328
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:57,820
It was meant to be the health care emergency response for the nation.

329
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:07,360
But there has been a lot of sort of tug and tug of war and kind of back and forth between Asper in the CDC of who's really in charge within HHS.

330
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:12,100
I didn't say the the big logo at the top is HHS, Department of Health and Human Services.

331
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:15,940
And generally speaking, HHS is part.

332
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:27,019
HHS is in the lead for all ESF eight response. All of the agencies you see below are are HHS agencies.

333
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:34,059
So, so all of these are part of HHS. Some of you might have seen that Aspen got renamed.

334
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:34,870
They got elevated.

335
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:42,159
So Asper was an assistant secretary for preparedness and response, and now it's the administration for strategic preparedness and response.

336
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:51,610
And what it what the Biden administration did is elevated, aspire to be at the same governmental level as CDC and the FDA and others,

337
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:55,480
which actually gives them more authority and more resource to be able to respond better.

338
00:32:56,260 --> 00:33:00,880
Asper has done a lot of great work. I actually, just for full disclosure, do a fair amount of work with expert,

339
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:07,629
but they've struggled a little bit because they haven't had the same kind of financing

340
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:13,060
and footing and autonomy that CDC and FDA and CMS have in the governmental response.

341
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:20,480
FDA. The Food and Drug Administration, is really important when there are medical countermeasures in particular.

342
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:25,240
So clearly you've seen the role that the FDA plays in vaccine approvals.

343
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:29,560
But but the same is true for therapeutics for any other medical countermeasure.

344
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:36,040
They're really an important player in this. CMS, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

345
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:41,139
I don't you know, you probably all know differing amounts of details, but CMS is,

346
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:45,219
of course, the largest payer for health care services in the country. You'd say, gosh, really?

347
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:50,080
Are they an emergency response? They are. They're kind of more like a governmental insurance company.

348
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:54,010
Well, frankly, you know what CMS does and doesn't pay pay for.

349
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:58,950
Is is the lifeblood of the health care system in the United States.

350
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:07,410
And so CMS actually has an entire set of regulations, of standards of how ready the health care system needs to be.

351
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:11,339
You are not eligible to get CMS money if you don't meet those standards.

352
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:16,889
And they are pretty much the single biggest determinant of what standards the health care

353
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:22,980
system has to be held to for readiness because of the fact that they are the big payer.

354
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:27,660
So so in other words, you know, they have the checkbook and they get to tell people what to do.

355
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:33,170
CMS has been steadily strengthening their emergency preparedness standards,

356
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:43,380
often working with with something called the joint commission since 911, but took a big step forward in 2017 with new standards.

357
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:47,190
There's still more they could do, and hopefully there's more they will do.

358
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:50,310
But but see them as a huge player in the response world.

359
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:55,349
Then lastly, and there are plenty of others, by the way, these are just the biggest folks,

360
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:58,280
but the U.S. Public Health Service has a commissioned corps.

361
00:34:58,290 --> 00:35:04,380
So many of you may have seen public health people that run around in things that look like Navy uniforms.

362
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:09,780
The commissioned corps is a commissioned service organization within the U.S. government.

363
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:18,690
They get ranks and titles that are the same as the as the naval titles, and they are service members with the United States government.

364
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:24,060
They have been used in a lot of disaster response, and they do support a lot of the federal disaster response.

365
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:29,250
So they're worth mentioning. But it's it's a really complicated topic.

366
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:32,670
Happy to answer questions if you guys have any public health service questions.

367
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:38,570
Most of the time, folks in the U.S. Public Health Service serve elsewhere in the Indian Health Service,

368
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:44,069
in CDC, Alaska, ASP, or in other parts of government doing daily public health.

369
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:50,879
Just actually next week, one of our guest lecturers is Commander Luis Garza from the service.

370
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:54,120
So awesome. They'll get that covered. She is fantastic.

371
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:57,190
So good job. Oh, you know her smile. I do. Okay.

372
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:07,700
Yes, that's great. So and we've got a few more slides, more charts, but I promise we're going to leave all the bureaucracy behind in a little bit.

373
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:16,670
Other people that support the SFA world are all the people you see here on the list and you can see again the complexity.

374
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:23,060
So agriculture is about food and water safety and making sure that we can feed the population commerce.

375
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:29,960
You have seen through the public health restrictions we've had in place during COBR.

376
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:38,630
There's a very tense relationship between business and the economy and public health at times, and that's an important thing to talk about.

377
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:46,430
Department of Defense We use their resources for transportation of patients in large scale disaster scenarios,

378
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:53,000
and we'll go through the whole of this video. But there is some sort of interplay with every single federal department here on the list,

379
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:55,970
with our ability to protect the nation's public health and health care.

380
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:03,540
So just very briefly, I wanted to spend a little bit of time talking about asked for the CDC and FEMA just so you know,

381
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:06,540
a teeny bit more about who they are and what they do.

382
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:09,630
And then we will dove into the actual stuff of what we do.

383
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:10,560
More in a minute.

384
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:18,080
So Aspire again got renamed from the Assistant Secretary for preparedness response to how the Administration for Strategic Preparedness Response.

385
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:19,219
But any way you look at it,

386
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:28,730
Aster is supposed to be the lead health care entity within within the Department of Health and Human Services for disaster areas.

387
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:32,810
They work with hospitals and health care coalitions. They work with biotech,

388
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:41,540
and they help try and develop new medical countermeasures and help protect the U.S. against health care threats or health threats,

389
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:45,560
excuse me, currently in this taking directly from their current website.

390
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:54,200
They have three priorities. The first is to try and continue to respond well and help the nation emerge from the COVID 19 pandemic.

391
00:37:55,300 --> 00:38:00,530
They are they're focused on trying to restore resources and capabilities that have been damaged during the pandemic.

392
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:08,630
And, you know, I will say as a health care provider, that the health care system is pretty significantly damaged from the pandemic.

393
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:12,800
Morale within the health care system is pretty tough.

394
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:16,520
We have a ton of people leaving health care. The finances are off.

395
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:22,430
Almost every health care system in the entire country is losing millions of dollars, if not hundreds of millions of dollars.

396
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:28,340
And the current the financial viability of the health care system is under threat.

397
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:32,630
Like, really, it hasn't been in probably 40, 50 years plus.

398
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:39,860
And a lot of health care resources have gone offline. You know, if we just take EMS, I don't know how many of you know,

399
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:44,329
the EMS system very well, but paramedics, EMT is that take care of patient transportation.

400
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:51,770
A ton of them have been leaving. Most parts of the country are facing endless shortages right now, just again because of work force shortfalls.

401
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:55,430
And then the third priority, prepare for for future emergencies.

402
00:38:55,430 --> 00:39:00,169
It just it seems so small given what we're facing, but there's still a ton of stuff that we have to prepare for.

403
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:07,520
We are absolutely still at risk of major hurricanes coming ashore nationally.

404
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:12,950
Tornadoes are worsening and increasing in intensity for for the middle part of the country.

405
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:20,629
The wildfire risks in the West and other parts of the country are increasing.

406
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:23,780
So they're just there's so many future emergencies we need to be working on.

407
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:29,990
And we're, you know, really struck right now, stuck trying to work mostly on priority one per victim.

408
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:35,210
Again, I apologize for showing it over charts. These are definitely not exciting.

409
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:41,839
But but two things to say about them. One is I want to sort of show you where some key things live within the federal government.

410
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:46,459
But two is to say these are always changing. Every few years, the boxes move around.

411
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:53,180
And I think that actually makes it pretty hard to respond when, you know, a new administration comes in,

412
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:57,110
a new set of people needs, some leaders comes in and they always reorganize.

413
00:39:57,110 --> 00:39:58,870
That's sort of what, you know, folks are. They do that,

414
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:03,620
but it's a constantly shifting landscape which makes it really hard to figure out who interfaces

415
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:07,760
with whom and how we respond together when we're kind of always reshuffling the deck.

416
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:14,900
But within the assistant secretary and Don O'Connell is the current asker, the current assistant secretary.

417
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:23,989
They have a whole branch on incident command and control, and they have a whole branch on operations and resources sort of planning and response.

418
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:32,900
And there's an Office of Emergency Management and Medical Operations and, you know, it's just one box, but it's got so much stuff in it.

419
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:39,050
It's got, I believe, 70 different disaster medical assistance teams from across the entire country.

420
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:44,840
The it's got the strategic national stockpile in it,

421
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:50,720
which is the nation's stockpile of antibiotics, IV fluids, ventilators, disaster, medical supplies.

422
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:56,900
It's got the entire response organization for are there to support the states and support the country.

423
00:40:57,770 --> 00:41:05,060
And so huge, huge chunks of the nation's disaster medical response system live within just, you know, sort of one another box here.

424
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:10,360
I will point out BARDA, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority.

425
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:11,860
Some of you might know Dhaka.

426
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:19,569
Dhaka is the Defense Advanced Projects Research Authority, which is in the Department of Defense, and it's been around for decades and decades.

427
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:25,240
And it was sort of the the scientific think tank that developed new defense strategies,

428
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:32,049
defense resources for the U.S. based on the success of Dhaka with the creation of Esper,

429
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:38,470
they created BARDA, and BARDA is constantly trying to create new medical countermeasures for the country.

430
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:47,230
And one thing I will say is really impressive is the many vaccines we have as well as other things have been acquired and supported through BARDA.

431
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:54,819
And it, in my mind is, is proving to be one of the most successful things we do, which is create new countermeasures,

432
00:41:54,820 --> 00:42:03,160
think creatively about what we need to protect public health and finance that in a way the tech sector does all the time to innovate.

433
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:10,059
So I think we need to continue specifically to prepare designed to fund these kinds of resources that we will only need the disaster.

434
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:12,370
But if we don't fund them now, we won't have the A disaster.

435
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:24,880
Asper currently tells health care organizations to focus on these four areas for preparedness and response.

436
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:30,780
The first is setting up coalitions. So for a little more than a decade now,

437
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:40,830
Aspen has been trying to pull health care infrastructure of the country together into these community based coalitions.

438
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:46,290
This means that all these different private sector hospitals that don't normally work together would get together.

439
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:51,090
They'd sit down with their EMS partners, with their public health partners, with their emergency management partners.

440
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:54,210
And the vision of coalitions is that they.

441
00:42:55,990 --> 00:43:00,160
Would be that whole community response that I showed you on the previous slide.

442
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:06,190
In the real world, coalitions look very different depending on where you are in the country.

443
00:43:08,530 --> 00:43:14,220
In my state and actually in the entire New England region, coalitions are single state organizations.

444
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:18,550
So, you know, Massachusetts has one health care coalition, New Hampshire has one, Maine has one, etc.

445
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:23,379
It's not entirely clear that that that is very different than a state organization otherwise.

446
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:27,730
And so, you know, it's not not always clear, you know.

447
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:29,980
The how the coalition functions.

448
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:40,060
I'll tell you, in Michigan where you are, you actually have a pretty good coalition system for emergency preparedness that is well supported,

449
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:45,580
has a medical director at the head of the coalition and they they've been doing this for years

450
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:51,640
and I think is a nice example of a way that the health and medical system can come together.

451
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:55,650
When coalitions are formed,

452
00:43:56,550 --> 00:44:02,340
then theoretically plans should be created between coalitions because events can definitely get bigger than one size coalition.

453
00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:07,250
Excuse me. And they prepare for their their help in that bold readiness.

454
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:10,829
So the first bullet point is, is creating the coalitions.

455
00:44:10,830 --> 00:44:13,440
Second point is coordinating plans across coalitions.

456
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:24,730
One thing that I think is is underappreciated still to this day in in the use of eight world this continuity of health care service delivery.

457
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:34,329
Most of the research is pretty clear that more people died following Hurricane Katrina from interruption

458
00:44:34,330 --> 00:44:39,910
in health care service availability than died from the sort of actual flooding and storm itself.

459
00:44:40,570 --> 00:44:47,140
That because the primary care or primary care system was so decimated after Hurricane Katrina.

460
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:52,840
Health care and public health and food service, shelter services were so damaged that.

461
00:44:53,870 --> 00:44:58,399
People just couldn't get their health care. They didn't take their diabetes medications, they didn't take their heart failure medications.

462
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:04,280
They didn't do all the stuff they needed to stay healthy for weeks and months and years.

463
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:11,360
And in fact, there's some interesting data that says that your risk of having a heart attack and risk of dying from a

464
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:18,530
heart attack was higher in the area affected by Hurricane Katrina ten years after Hurricane Katrina struck,

465
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:23,270
as compared to comparative regions in the Gulf Coast otherwise.

466
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:32,870
And so the health care system really does get damaged. And the medical consequences for the community are huge.

467
00:45:32,870 --> 00:45:36,649
And I think people tend to think of, you know, disaster health care response,

468
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:41,400
disaster medical response and public health response as kind of the immediate aftermath of the disaster.

469
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:46,280
And we always focus on flooding victims or people who get injured by falling trees or whatever.

470
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:50,059
The thing is, it really is the interruption of health care services and public health

471
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:55,190
availability that often can make a far bigger impact on the health of a population.

472
00:45:56,870 --> 00:46:04,040
Lastly, medical surge. Because we have a privately funded health care system.

473
00:46:04,430 --> 00:46:08,900
Health care, generally speaking, in the U.S. is run like a business and in businesses.

474
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:15,200
If any of you have kids that are done business training, you know, day one at business school is excess capacity equals waste.

475
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:20,330
And so businesses are always striving to get rid of excess capacity wherever they can.

476
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:23,750
Because that limits costs and that makes them as efficient as possible.

477
00:46:24,290 --> 00:46:28,040
They don't have people sitting around and not doing work. They don't have unused beds.

478
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:36,040
They don't have unused resources. In my world, you know, as an emergency planner, excess capacity is surge capacity.

479
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:43,869
It's that disaster resource we need. When bad things happen and you know, I use the analogy of kind of driving your car on the highway.

480
00:46:43,870 --> 00:46:52,569
You would never want to drive your car. As you know, you never want to buy a car that goes only 55 miles an hour and no further and no faster.

481
00:46:52,570 --> 00:46:55,630
And, you know, if you're on the highway, you can go 55 miles an hour.

482
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:59,440
That's fine. Except what happens when you have to go a little faster to pass somebody or to get around.

483
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:05,410
You need a little excess capacity to be safe. And the same is absolutely true in the health care system.

484
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:11,590
Having a health care system that is financially incentivized not to have any extra nurses or doctors,

485
00:47:11,590 --> 00:47:15,580
any extra beds, any surge capability is is what really.

486
00:47:17,130 --> 00:47:20,370
Underlay a lot of the challenges we face responding to Katrina.

487
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:26,040
The old architecture, excuse me, tend to come in the you know,

488
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:31,200
part of the reason we're still seeing terrible health consequences and COVID is we have had to cancel and

489
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:37,020
defer an enormous amount of medical care in order to make room for the patients that we've had through COVID.

490
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,690
And there are real health consequences to that.

491
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:46,769
And so, you know, very appropriately, we need to be able to take care of patients with COVID, but it's come at a significant cost.

492
00:47:46,770 --> 00:47:49,830
And we still don't really have surge capacity of the health care system.

493
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:55,770
On top of that, trying to manage it in a in a community way is is really hard.

494
00:47:55,770 --> 00:48:01,139
There are some really tough articles to read from New York Times,

495
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:08,550
L.A. Times and Wall Street Journal that describe some of the response in California, in New York, in Texas,

496
00:48:09,210 --> 00:48:13,830
where there were hospitals, typically safety net hospitals,

497
00:48:13,830 --> 00:48:22,410
community hospitals that had far more than far more ICU patients than they could possibly care for safely.

498
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:26,760
But no hospitals would accept transfer of those ICU patients even if they had beds,

499
00:48:27,090 --> 00:48:32,250
because these were often uninsured or underinsured individuals and they just didn't want to take the financial liability.

500
00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:37,200
And people died as a result of it, obviously contributed to excess mortality.

501
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:43,770
And, you know, unless they have a good system that basically forces the medical infrastructure to work

502
00:48:43,770 --> 00:48:48,210
together to accommodate all patients in the community who need critical level care,

503
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:52,920
life saving care, we're going to continue to have the excess mortality.

504
00:48:52,920 --> 00:49:02,760
And I'm pretty proud that in our region of Massachusetts, we did form collaboratives and we never had a hospital that was unable to offer ICU care.

505
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:09,480
Or if we had an ICU bed hospital, it ran out of ICU beds. There always was another place to transfer them, but that was not true across the country.

506
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:16,500
CDC. This is, I think, my second the last of the painful organizational charts.

507
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:23,250
But I just want to show you a couple of things. And you all know that that the CDC is in the process of reorganizing.

508
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:28,170
So Rochelle Walensky, the current CDC director, actually came from Mass General and a woman I respect upon.

509
00:49:28,170 --> 00:49:30,390
I think she's a phenomenal leader.

510
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:38,690
She's ordered reorganizing the CDC because there were clearly a lot of failures, I think, in the response to COVID in the CDC.

511
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:46,440
As you would expect, the CDC has a very large branch focused on infectious diseases.

512
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:49,890
That's what they do. They're a public health agency. A lot of focused on that.

513
00:49:50,730 --> 00:49:54,570
They do have a separate branch for public health, noninfectious diseases.

514
00:49:54,570 --> 00:50:00,340
And so things like developmental disabilities, chronic health, disease, toxic substances.

515
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:02,730
Again, I know a number of you are focused on environmental health.

516
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:10,139
ATSDR, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, is a big part of looking at environmental health, toxins,

517
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:21,510
exposures that those you know, both of those direct deputy directorates are are classic public health focus areas.

518
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:25,370
Then if you look over public health science and surveillance,

519
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:34,850
certainly you all know that that public health data is essential for any good public health response.

520
00:50:35,610 --> 00:50:39,770
You I'll use one one more business school act but business school phrase.

521
00:50:39,990 --> 00:50:41,570
But you can't management can't measure.

522
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:48,739
And if you can't measure public health and measure health outcomes, if you don't know how healthy community is, you can't have effective programs.

523
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:50,960
You're not really knowing whether you're responding well or not.

524
00:50:50,990 --> 00:50:55,850
So there's a there's a whole system on public health science and surveillance, I will tell you that.

525
00:50:56,660 --> 00:51:00,440
One of the great challenges we face during COVID is that.

526
00:51:01,510 --> 00:51:08,440
The DOD deputy director, and that that effort is, in fact, looking at public health, really doesn't look at the health care system.

527
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:14,770
It's it's back to my theme that CDC really doesn't directly interface with the health care system.

528
00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:21,250
And so when we struggled during COVID, trying to figure out how busy hospitals were, where was there overcrowding,

529
00:51:21,610 --> 00:51:27,860
where were there no ICU beds, etc. We had never built systems through that public health service,

530
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:34,209
science and surveillance world because that that really wasn't the focus of what CDC does it and I think appropriately so,

531
00:51:34,210 --> 00:51:35,650
but they didn't exist elsewhere.

532
00:51:36,070 --> 00:51:43,750
And so one of the great challenges, I think, has been trying to develop parallel systems that don't just look at public health data.

533
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:48,700
You know, how about these community where they're health threats, but look at health system response capabilities,

534
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:54,370
look at capacity and develop data systems that monitor that and in real time

535
00:51:54,730 --> 00:51:58,360
to give it sort of equal priority so that we can manage our response better.

536
00:51:59,230 --> 00:52:06,730
Paul, I have a question for you. Yeah. So see, you know, with this reorganization of the CDC and I can't answer this question,

537
00:52:07,150 --> 00:52:10,990
maybe you can answer this question more competently than I can.

538
00:52:11,770 --> 00:52:22,540
You know, I've gotten some questions from students and other folks about, you know, the CDC has lost so much credibility over the pandemic.

539
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:31,120
And, you know, with all this anti-vaccine anti-science rhetoric, we're kind of undoing like a century's worth of public health efforts.

540
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:38,679
So, you know, do you think this reorganization is sufficient enough to change the public health

541
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:45,489
perspective of the CDC or like what can it do to kind of repair the damage?

542
00:52:45,490 --> 00:52:49,420
Because I, I don't I don't do like communications or marketing.

543
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:53,290
So I'm curious if you have a different perspective.

544
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,389
Yeah. I mean, I've got I don't know.

545
00:52:55,390 --> 00:53:02,860
I mean, I certainly share the perspective of, you know, how damaged the CDC is, reputation is and and how fractured we are as a country.

546
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:09,430
I think, you know, I will try not to be political, but I think it's very challenging that, you know,

547
00:53:10,210 --> 00:53:17,470
we we had we have politicized the response and that there is debate about scientific data.

548
00:53:17,770 --> 00:53:21,370
Scientific data is scientific data. And you can argue sometimes on interpretation.

549
00:53:21,850 --> 00:53:30,079
But but I you know. Our especially our public health structure is best founded when it is data supported and data driven.

550
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:39,680
And I think, you know, some a good chunk of this is of the challenge came from when the agency was not data driven, I think.

551
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:46,190
You know, I can't comment fully on, I guess, the reorganization since it hasn't been released yet.

552
00:53:46,350 --> 00:53:50,580
So it's all I hope we know what it looks like. It's going to be hard to say whether it's going to be good or not.

553
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:55,230
Any way you look at it, even if it's a brilliant reorganization, which I hope it is,

554
00:53:56,250 --> 00:54:00,870
it'll still take many, many years to, I think, rebuild the trust and authority of the CDC.

555
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:06,020
I think the other trick, a big challenge and this is probably know.

556
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:09,890
There's little contentious, but offered as a perspective for all you guys.

557
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:20,120
The CDC for the very longest time prioritized being rights over being relevant or current.

558
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:25,719
And what I mean by that is they would take however much time they needed to make

559
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:28,990
a decision to gather the data to make sure they never got ahead of the data.

560
00:54:28,990 --> 00:54:33,879
And again, I mean, I've just been talking about how important the data is and how much it is, how important it is.

561
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:37,060
You follow science, not politics in public health.

562
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:38,920
I couldn't support that more strongly.

563
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:49,330
However, when things are moving really, really fast, you also have to be able to make decisions based on the limited data you have so far.

564
00:54:49,750 --> 00:54:58,879
And the problem is, is is if you don't make decisions or if you don't give guidance when it's needed, people make it up on their own.

565
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:01,570
And part of the reason we saw a lot of states going in a lot of different directions,

566
00:55:01,570 --> 00:55:05,950
part of the reason I think we saw a lot of challenges if you're not fast enough.

567
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:18,629
You become irrelevant and. What I think one of the big challenges for CDC is going to be to be faster, to make sure that they can give guidance,

568
00:55:18,630 --> 00:55:26,730
they can lead the response always based on data and science to recognize when there's uncertainty, they still have to act.

569
00:55:26,730 --> 00:55:27,930
There still has to be a decision.

570
00:55:29,370 --> 00:55:36,359
There's a sort of derisive comment you'll hear a lot of among emergency managers saying public health has never found a problem.

571
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:44,010
They can't have a meeting about it. And it is true that public health is not necessarily known for being responsive and fast.

572
00:55:45,210 --> 00:55:52,170
What I think has to happen also is that as you as you work towards getting more responsive and faster,

573
00:55:52,170 --> 00:55:59,340
which I think you just have to do to be relevant, you have to have the communication skills to be able to effectively communicate that you're doing.

574
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:02,040
You're saying what you say based on what you know, but it may well change.

575
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:08,760
And I think we didn't know one across the country, I think did a good job of that through COVID that we would say, here's what we're doing.

576
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:12,239
And and the population tends to hear, okay, this is the right answer.

577
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:14,370
And then when you change a month later or two weeks later,

578
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:19,469
people then default to what you didn't really know what you were doing, you made a mistake or you went the wrong direction.

579
00:56:19,470 --> 00:56:24,650
And that's not the way the world works, right? Sometimes we think we know X and then we get more data.

580
00:56:24,670 --> 00:56:31,079
We change because we're adaptive, but we have to do a much better job of communicating that to the public to say, here's what we know now.

581
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:36,690
This is a decision for now, but we're still learning and we may change. And that's a hard public message.

582
00:56:36,690 --> 00:56:39,719
It's hard to get out to that, to the whole population, to get them to understand. Well,

583
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:45,240
but one of the most important things I think CDC has to do is figure out how to communicate uncertainty

584
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:50,549
better and communicate the change doesn't mean that you were wrong when you made your first decision.

585
00:56:50,550 --> 00:56:55,170
It just means that you've learned better information and you're updating continually based on data.

586
00:56:56,630 --> 00:57:02,120
Thank you. Yeah, that was a really long answer. I'm sorry about that. All right, so we'll keep going.

587
00:57:02,610 --> 00:57:08,239
But but I will say, you know, since he does have a center for preparedness and response, he does have an emergency operation center.

588
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:10,040
It does respond to disasters.

589
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:17,210
But I think there's a lot of work to do to update the CDC to to be in line with the pace of the emergencies we're facing, you know.

590
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:25,190
Monkeypox is another really good example that even though, you know, we've been planning for ortho pox virus outbreaks for a long time,

591
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:32,930
it took a while to get good action and guidance during the monkeypox response that we need to,

592
00:57:33,170 --> 00:57:37,159
you know, that we needed in order to guide our national response.

593
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:45,379
And I think we're catching up. Monkeypox the monkeypox response is improving, but it's a good illustration of, you know, threats are not going away.

594
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:48,080
And there are always things that we don't have to respond to to respond to quickly.

595
00:57:50,850 --> 00:57:58,340
So interestingly, there are different sets of domains and capabilities for public health than there are for health care.

596
00:57:58,420 --> 00:58:01,650
Like I showed you, four domains for health care.

597
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:05,010
There are six domains for public health.

598
00:58:05,290 --> 00:58:09,569
It's a little tricky sometimes when you try and get hospitals and public health departments to work together because the

599
00:58:09,570 --> 00:58:14,970
federal guidance and the money they get from the federal government to work on things is is focused in different areas.

600
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:21,570
But these are the things that public health departments across the country, state and local public health departments, are asked to do.

601
00:58:21,990 --> 00:58:31,020
They get money called Public Health Emergency Preparedness Funding, and they're supposed to work on these each year.

602
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:38,580
And the guidance that that money each year comes usually with the set of deliverables on which these things are supposed to be focusing on.

603
00:58:41,030 --> 00:58:44,450
Last hour, I promise, is is the work of homeland security.

604
00:58:44,450 --> 00:58:53,330
And again, it was created out of the 911 attacks to try and improve the readiness of the of the nation.

605
00:58:53,890 --> 00:58:58,490
But I would point out that there is no health care.

606
00:58:59,060 --> 00:59:08,360
There is a the Department of Homeland Security does have a medical director, and it does have a tiny little medical branch in it.

607
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:12,080
But it really is not focused on health care. It's not focused on public health.

608
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:14,210
And so you see FEMA's here.

609
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:23,690
FEMA is within the Department of Homeland Security, but most everybody else who's here is more kind of law enforcement based.

610
00:59:23,690 --> 00:59:29,750
Right. So there's Coast Guard, there's Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Secret Service.

611
00:59:31,070 --> 00:59:32,570
You can read through all the boxes, but.

612
00:59:33,510 --> 00:59:44,399
I think people misunderstand that either FEMA or DHS is a health response organization or has oversight of the public health and medical response.

613
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:51,690
And really, that's not true in the U.S. Almost all of the public health medical response is managed out of HHS.

614
00:59:53,070 --> 00:59:59,790
And that interface between HHS and DHS is is really complex.

615
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:04,049
They kind of continue to have a bit of a frenemy relationship.

616
01:00:04,050 --> 01:00:09,360
And I think it's part of the reason we often see a bit of a fracture in how the nation responds together.

617
01:00:11,690 --> 01:00:15,610
So. What we're going to do just for the last little bit.

618
01:00:15,610 --> 01:00:21,429
And I again, I apologize that there was so much bureaucracy in the previous set asides,

619
01:00:21,430 --> 01:00:24,400
but you kind of have to know how we plan to do it and how the systems are set up.

620
01:00:25,270 --> 01:00:29,530
If you want to either analyze how we're currently doing it or figure out how to how to do it better.

621
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:34,360
I mentioned already that all disasters start locally.

622
01:00:34,510 --> 01:00:41,050
They really do. And I think at the end of the day, if you're a person, if you're a resident within the United States,

623
01:00:41,470 --> 01:00:45,330
what you care about is the immediate availability of public health medical services to you.

624
01:00:45,340 --> 01:00:47,740
So it kind of starts and ends locally any way you look at it.

625
01:00:48,610 --> 01:00:52,870
The reason it's a question mark regional is that nobody can define what regional really means.

626
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:58,150
I think you'll notice that sometimes people use the word regional differently.

627
01:00:58,150 --> 01:01:01,840
I actually use the shorthand of saying lowercase R and capital R to talk about regional.

628
01:01:02,230 --> 01:01:06,760
Lowercase R is a sub state region. So, you know, multiple regions within a state.

629
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:11,680
I can't remember exact. I think Michigan's divided into six regions.

630
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:17,500
I can't remember from public health preparedness response perspective, but there's multiple in Michigan and then there's the state.

631
01:01:17,770 --> 01:01:19,179
But then I say capital, our region,

632
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:29,589
which is a multi-state region and I have a couple of programs here at Mass General Hospital that focus on what we call the region one response.

633
01:01:29,590 --> 01:01:33,010
So Health and Human Services has divided the country into ten regions.

634
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:37,540
The New England region, the six state region here is HHS Region one.

635
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:46,690
And so we work a lot on trying to sew together the emergency response plans for public health in health care across all six states.

636
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:59,530
And then, of course, state and federal is sort of self-explanatory. This is not an alternative concept and this has been around now since the mid

637
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:05,230
2000s and we are still trying to figure out how to make this work as we speak.

638
01:02:05,890 --> 01:02:15,219
But theoretically, this is sort of kind of how local health care ties all the way up to the federal level health care asset management,

639
01:02:15,220 --> 01:02:18,790
the bottom tier that first here is an individual health care facility, HCA.

640
01:02:19,330 --> 01:02:26,440
So hospital A, hospital B, hospital C, these are the individual hospitals and communities or non-health care facility providers, right?

641
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:35,139
So dialysis centers that are freestanding, community health centers, individual doctors are offices or others, they are all individual.

642
01:02:35,140 --> 01:02:39,430
And there again, as I mentioned before, they're supposed to be tied up into coalitions.

643
01:02:39,820 --> 01:02:44,380
Some coalitions have more expertize and resource than others.

644
01:02:44,650 --> 01:02:46,390
Some have more authority than others.

645
01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:53,590
In general, right now, most of the coalitions cross country are being used for information, support and communication, but not much else.

646
01:02:53,980 --> 01:02:57,910
Again, Michigan, little bit better than most of the states in the country.

647
01:02:58,690 --> 01:03:06,249
Texas, interestingly, has has a really good system, but that's partially because it's been funded by their transportation.

648
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:12,640
Dollars is a trauma system. And so they're their statewide trauma system and preparedness systems are really well integrated.

649
01:03:13,930 --> 01:03:19,960
The third tier is starting to tie people together across multiple jurisdictions.

650
01:03:20,170 --> 01:03:26,500
So this is now ensuring large numbers of communities work together.

651
01:03:26,830 --> 01:03:33,140
And ultimately that feeds up to the state and that's the fourth tier. The capital of our region is the fifth tier.

652
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:37,700
The stuff that I work on for the New England region would out there. And then the federal response is the six tier.

653
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:42,939
You can see just based on the complexity of all the different order charts,

654
01:03:42,940 --> 01:03:48,790
all the different lines that connect A to B to C that I've showed you that this is really, really hard to navigate.

655
01:03:48,790 --> 01:03:52,180
These take six years to kind of figure out who talks to who when.

656
01:03:52,540 --> 01:03:56,920
And the fact that these artworks change every couple of years doesn't doesn't make it any easier.

657
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:00,819
But but this is theoretically how we're supposed to work together.

658
01:04:00,820 --> 01:04:08,469
And I think hopefully as we come out of COVID, we are going to ideally start to land on a more predictable,

659
01:04:08,470 --> 01:04:17,260
more integrated system that defines exactly how these tiers relate to one another, and importantly, how the federal agencies work together better.

660
01:04:19,700 --> 01:04:22,010
So what should we be doing?

661
01:04:22,730 --> 01:04:29,299
Well, I won't read this whole slide to you, but these are the things that we need to be doing much, much better or at the community level.

662
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:34,580
So as we improve our collections, we improve our community response.

663
01:04:35,420 --> 01:04:44,060
We really have to put our money where our mouth is. When we when we talk about whole community response and what I see a hand up just once a.

664
01:04:46,710 --> 01:04:54,600
We've all seen through COVID that that. There were absolutely parts of our communities that did far less well than others.

665
01:04:55,290 --> 01:04:58,380
Communities of color. Economically disadvantaged communities.

666
01:04:59,340 --> 01:05:05,669
Communities with access and language issues. And this pandemic clearly has not hit everybody equally.

667
01:05:05,670 --> 01:05:12,090
And those who already have the greatest health care disparities suffered the most through through the pandemic by far.

668
01:05:12,750 --> 01:05:19,680
We have to, I think, pivot when we start talking about whole community response to look at where existing health disparities exist.

669
01:05:19,950 --> 01:05:24,149
Look at where we are not on a daily basis reaching people while they're protecting their health.

670
01:05:24,150 --> 01:05:30,300
Well. And then start with that group to develop community response as opposed to end to end with it.

671
01:05:31,380 --> 01:05:35,340
Historically, health emergency preparedness has started with plan for everybody,

672
01:05:35,700 --> 01:05:39,150
then figure out who's vulnerable and see what you can do to help out those communities.

673
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:43,050
I think the whole point of this slide really is to say we need to pivot,

674
01:05:43,470 --> 01:05:47,310
which is we start with those who are most vulnerable, those who are most likely to have disparate effects.

675
01:05:48,710 --> 01:05:54,110
Focus our planning efforts and our resources in that direction, because we know that's where the disproportionate burden is going to be.

676
01:05:54,470 --> 01:05:59,260
You know, in Katrina, who who drowned, who couldn't evacuate, who had the most health care services,

677
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:02,660
was those who were poor as those who didn't have transportation resources, etc.

678
01:06:04,220 --> 01:06:10,880
We need to do that for our community preparedness. And again, it's one of the things I'm hoping to see come out of our COVID response efforts.

679
01:06:11,210 --> 01:06:14,790
Sorry. It. Yes. That. Sorry.

680
01:06:14,790 --> 01:06:20,339
My question pertains to the slide before this. Earlier in the presentation,

681
01:06:20,340 --> 01:06:29,100
you had talked about how I forget the name of like it's like the point person who's kind of delegating or like everyone responds to this person.

682
01:06:29,910 --> 01:06:35,190
But with that tier that you had created, I'm just like, how do you identify who that person is?

683
01:06:35,190 --> 01:06:39,870
Is there already like a system? Like, is that someone from FEMA who would be doing that?

684
01:06:39,870 --> 01:06:44,519
Is it someone who's at the local level? What happens when it's across multiple states?

685
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:50,010
Right. So then is there someone identified at the regional level? Like how are you identifying who that point person?

686
01:06:50,550 --> 01:06:53,610
Yeah, commander. Yeah, well, yeah.

687
01:06:53,910 --> 01:07:04,319
So, so that's a great question. So for any individual organization, there's an incident commander for a for a regional response.

688
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:09,570
There is usually a coordinating officer or and EOC manager.

689
01:07:09,570 --> 01:07:13,670
So so this is the federal cordoning off when this person is appointed by FEMA.

690
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:18,690
So when you're saying sort of who manages, you know, across federal, it's usually there's a federal coordinating officer.

691
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:25,710
Now, states typically also are responsible for setting up a state coordinating officer to lead the state response in those needs to work together.

692
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:31,049
All of these people come together in something called an emergency operations center in EOC.

693
01:07:31,050 --> 01:07:36,990
And again, they're just acronyms all over this world. But every EOC has a manager but not a commander.

694
01:07:36,990 --> 01:07:46,620
And the point is that these 15 emergency support functions are always in support of the people who are responding, but they don't absolutely direct.

695
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:48,929
And so, you know,

696
01:07:48,930 --> 01:07:54,749
you've I'm sure you've seen this time and again where a different response is it's not clear who's in charge or who's really responding well.

697
01:07:54,750 --> 01:08:04,220
It's the local, it's the state and federal. It's often because the authorities or the responsibility is a little muddy in there.

698
01:08:04,390 --> 01:08:11,150
They're trying to support, not lead. So right now in the current system, the federal cordoning off so again, coordinates and supports,

699
01:08:11,310 --> 01:08:16,350
but the principal person with the authority remains actually the local person, interestingly.

700
01:08:17,290 --> 01:08:24,189
Does that help? Yeah. That is just because it seems like someone at the local level would understand

701
01:08:24,190 --> 01:08:27,910
the context of the emergency a little bit more that someone from FEMA coming in.

702
01:08:28,540 --> 01:08:34,629
Yeah, no, exactly. Right. And so, you know, that's where, you know, FEMA will always say they're never in charge.

703
01:08:34,630 --> 01:08:39,760
They're always in support. But but I think, you know, to the point I think you're making a.

704
01:08:41,730 --> 01:08:46,260
If they if they're not listening to the local officials, if they if they're not well connected to the local intelligence,

705
01:08:46,260 --> 01:08:49,490
that they're not necessarily going to help in the best way that they need to be helping get.

706
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:57,290
Recovery. Again, I've got to just make a couple more comments on recovery.

707
01:08:58,040 --> 01:09:02,689
You know, response is huge. And you've seen this after, you know, lots of hurricanes and other events.

708
01:09:02,690 --> 01:09:10,400
But, you know, the the recovery from Hurricane Katrina, the formal recovery lasted more than a decade.

709
01:09:11,030 --> 01:09:18,140
Right. So a storm that was ashore for a week caused a response that needed more than ten years of recovery.

710
01:09:19,130 --> 01:09:25,430
The Superstorm Sandy recovery was, I believe, at least five or six years, and that's the formal part.

711
01:09:25,670 --> 01:09:30,590
As I said, you know, health effects of Katrina were lingering well, well past that.

712
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:38,589
So. There is an important emphasis on recovering.

713
01:09:38,590 --> 01:09:43,749
Well, you know, it's very common that everybody sort of packs up their response structures and

714
01:09:43,750 --> 01:09:47,649
tries to pretend like things are back to normal as soon as the response is over.

715
01:09:47,650 --> 01:09:54,350
But. It's really, really important to note that the whole goal of emergency response is actually not to get through the event,

716
01:09:54,350 --> 01:10:01,190
but it's to get back to normal or better. And you're really not done with your response until you're back to normal or better.

717
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:10,220
And because that can take so very long, we underestimate recovery, our planning efforts and the resources we dedicated to recovery.

718
01:10:11,180 --> 01:10:14,990
And so, despite all of your efforts, want to make sure you understand that that.

719
01:10:15,900 --> 01:10:21,380
Recovery is huge and often gets inadequately funded, adequately resourced to do what it needs to.

720
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:27,410
We've talked a fair amount about this already, which is emergency operations coordination.

721
01:10:27,430 --> 01:10:32,530
The idea is to have all the right players federal, state and local together in support of the incident.

722
01:10:32,530 --> 01:10:35,950
And the whole national incident management system, which you're going to hear about,

723
01:10:35,950 --> 01:10:41,860
is meant to provide that framework for the talks to who and how do they do it and how do we collaborate?

724
01:10:43,510 --> 01:10:46,270
It's meant to bring at the local level all these folks together.

725
01:10:46,270 --> 01:10:52,809
So it's fire police teams, emergency managers, health care, public health, private sector entities.

726
01:10:52,810 --> 01:10:56,170
You know, large private sector businesses sometimes play a role.

727
01:10:57,370 --> 01:11:04,230
And, you know, none of this importance of coordinating your local responses is is new.

728
01:11:05,220 --> 01:11:08,580
I still find this sort of whole experience, this quote, fascinating.

729
01:11:08,580 --> 01:11:15,420
But you all remember that many, many years ago there was a bombing at a federal building in Oklahoma City at the Murrah Building.

730
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:22,139
And it was amazing to me that literally about two weeks prior, the fire department, police department,

731
01:11:22,140 --> 01:11:28,110
public health department participated in their first joint course together in Oklahoma City.

732
01:11:28,110 --> 01:11:31,259
And they just hadn't met each other. They hadn't practiced disaster response.

733
01:11:31,260 --> 01:11:38,190
And this we're not talking about like 1940, this, this this happened in the 1990, which I'm absolutely astounded by.

734
01:11:38,670 --> 01:11:44,479
But nonetheless. When it happens, they got together, they trained.

735
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:49,040
And then when the bombing happened and they had to respond to this terrible disaster, they respond.

736
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:51,859
They all said they responded so much better because they met each other and worked together.

737
01:11:51,860 --> 01:11:55,490
And, you know, the former chief of Bosnia comes here where I am.

738
01:11:56,360 --> 01:12:01,310
Had I had a phrase you like to use all the time, which is a disaster, is no place to exchange business cards.

739
01:12:01,700 --> 01:12:07,849
You have to know each other. You have to work together well before a disaster if you have any hope of responding well together.

740
01:12:07,850 --> 01:12:13,489
And so creating disaster communities that are cross-cutting, that have public health and health care, working together,

741
01:12:13,490 --> 01:12:18,620
knowing each other, that have local and state and federal folks knowing each other, working together.

742
01:12:19,010 --> 01:12:21,799
You've got their phone numbers in your cell phone. You talked together.

743
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:24,950
You've you've been through exercises, you've tested your capabilities together.

744
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:32,270
It's the most important thing you can do to actually better weave together the system that sometimes works well and sometimes is pretty fractured.

745
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:35,310
To give you an example of this.

746
01:12:35,490 --> 01:12:45,540
This is back from 911 or the start of this 2001 time, you might remember, after the after the World Trade Center and the Pentagon were hit.

747
01:12:46,260 --> 01:12:53,730
There were letters here. These are these are photos that were mailed to folks that had anthrax in them.

748
01:12:54,360 --> 01:13:03,420
And the story from this is that during the response to the anthrax attacks, because it's the U.S. Postal Service, which is better government,

749
01:13:03,690 --> 01:13:12,600
there were federal public health authorities at one end of the Maine Capitol Building telling people who received the mail what to do.

750
01:13:13,020 --> 01:13:15,749
And then it was a local event because it happened in Washington,

751
01:13:15,750 --> 01:13:20,940
D.C. And so there were people at the other end of the Capitol building that were from the local public health giving a different set of advice and

752
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:24,899
literally a two ends of the Capitol building and one group saying you've got

753
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:27,960
to take antibiotics for the next six weeks or you're at high risk of dying.

754
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:31,200
And the other public health group is saying, no, no, you're fine. Don't don't worry about it.

755
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:35,490
You don't need to do anything. And one of those answers was clearly wrong.

756
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:42,390
But because there were overlapping, overlapping jurisdictions and overlapping authorities, we had a very divergent response.

757
01:13:42,660 --> 01:13:50,340
And it it to this day has undermined a lot of people's faith in the public health and government response in the postal service.

758
01:13:51,180 --> 01:13:58,139
It's really important, you know, to say that, unfortunately, we didn't really solve this even by the time we got to COVID 19,

759
01:13:58,140 --> 01:14:06,480
that we had very different advice and very different responses coming from overlapping jurisdictions between local communities,

760
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:14,960
state government and the federal government. But the public health system really needs to be able to do is, you know,

761
01:14:15,410 --> 01:14:20,210
do a better job of informing the public and response personnel about the risks.

762
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:26,629
We have some technical systems that we use. There is something called the hand that you should you need to know exists.

763
01:14:26,630 --> 01:14:32,540
But it's a national structure that typically is maintained individually in each state, slightly differently.

764
01:14:33,140 --> 01:14:34,910
But but it's an emergency broadcast system.

765
01:14:34,910 --> 01:14:40,370
So if you're part of a hospital response team or a public health response team, others, when there's a disaster,

766
01:14:40,370 --> 01:14:45,890
you get a message, you get a phone call, you can get a text message, you get an e-mail, you have a page, or even send your pager.

767
01:14:46,370 --> 01:14:51,080
And so the heart is a great emergency broadcast system to the nation's public health.

768
01:14:51,650 --> 01:14:56,720
Structured. We have the emergency broadcast system. You've heard those tests on your TV or radio.

769
01:14:57,080 --> 01:14:59,870
There's media messaging. There's what's called reverse nine on one.

770
01:14:59,870 --> 01:15:08,930
A lot of communities can actually call every landline inside their community with a pre-taped message and get messages out quickly.

771
01:15:10,460 --> 01:15:15,890
That, unfortunately, is becoming less and less relevant as more and more people are just cutting their landlines.

772
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:19,760
But but we have ways to communicate. It's not the technology that gets the message out.

773
01:15:20,030 --> 01:15:24,310
That's the issue. It's the message itself. And, you know, Aurora question kind of got to that.

774
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:31,610
You guys are already, you know, at best, but we have to improve how we share information with the public.

775
01:15:33,380 --> 01:15:37,250
For years, we've talked about how important it is to do risk communication training,

776
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:41,420
to have the people who do the messaging be trained risk communicators.

777
01:15:42,230 --> 01:15:46,250
But I think there's just no way to say that we did it well during COVID 19.

778
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:52,250
I think people didn't appreciate the risks to themselves personally from COVID necessarily,

779
01:15:52,460 --> 01:15:56,270
didn't appreciate why they should take certain protective actions.

780
01:15:57,650 --> 01:16:02,930
Obviously, the vaccine message got incredibly politicized and has been I think it's been very

781
01:16:02,930 --> 01:16:07,489
challenging to have a unified public health response because certainly because of,

782
01:16:07,490 --> 01:16:13,490
frankly, the politicization of the response, but also because of challenges in how we message.

783
01:16:15,450 --> 01:16:19,320
There are some basic principles on how we're supposed to message, which is be simple.

784
01:16:19,710 --> 01:16:24,510
You cannot it's really hard to get complex messages across timely.

785
01:16:24,540 --> 01:16:27,610
I've talked about when we're discussing the CDC.

786
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:31,020
If you have the right message but it's a week late, no one cares.

787
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:36,300
You have to be able to communicate when people care, when the issues in the press, when when it's in the public eye.

788
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:40,770
You have to be able to respond. And if you don't, people will not pay attention to you.

789
01:16:41,550 --> 01:16:42,390
You have to be accurate.

790
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:51,990
I would could not emphasize more how much we have to just pay attention to what the science and what the data say, ignoring what the politics say.

791
01:16:52,860 --> 01:16:56,310
You repeat your message. You have to be consistent. Part of the problem.

792
01:16:56,600 --> 01:17:01,530
The media loves to talk to anybody who has an authoritative title.

793
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:05,910
So, you know, says particularly as a physician, but they love to put doctors in front of the TV.

794
01:17:06,330 --> 01:17:11,910
There are plenty of doctors have no idea what they're talking about who get in front of the TV regularly and communicate that information.

795
01:17:13,620 --> 01:17:19,889
I think we have to create better partnerships between the health and public health communities and the media

796
01:17:19,890 --> 01:17:25,800
to try and make sure that the people who are in fact put in front of media outlets are actually credible.

797
01:17:26,070 --> 01:17:37,180
So that when we repeat our message. We were repeating the same correct message as opposed to creating a false stream of information.

798
01:17:37,180 --> 01:17:41,920
That's that's that seems to be credible that there really isn't based on the credentials of the person there.

799
01:17:42,310 --> 01:17:47,340
So that gives us consistent. Medical countermeasures.

800
01:17:47,350 --> 01:17:54,460
You know, we've seen so much about vaccine administration and ultimately, you know, you.

801
01:17:57,160 --> 01:18:03,400
We need it. We need an enormous amount of infrastructure to develop the first round of vaccines as we, I hope,

802
01:18:03,430 --> 01:18:11,440
get incredibly good uptake of the bivalent boosters that will help mitigate against whatever the surge is going to look like this fall and winter.

803
01:18:11,860 --> 01:18:14,110
We continue to need medical countermeasure dispensing,

804
01:18:14,110 --> 01:18:20,770
but there are lots of other public health threats that are not the global pandemic that may need antibiotics, that may need any toxins.

805
01:18:20,950 --> 01:18:24,340
We talked about BARDA and its development of other medical countermeasures.

806
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:31,870
There are lots of reasons why we need to be maybe we may need to be able to get medical countermeasures out to the population.

807
01:18:31,870 --> 01:18:34,630
And I think we need to continue to invest in these systems.

808
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:39,850
Local public health budgets and local public health systems have been completely decimated in the last 20, 30 years.

809
01:18:40,180 --> 01:18:45,820
And we we have to reinvest in our local public health infrastructure so that they can support more effective.

810
01:18:48,950 --> 01:18:53,629
Public health countermeasure release. And I know we are getting a little close to time.

811
01:18:53,630 --> 01:19:00,780
I promise I will actually wrap up before ten. Medical material, management and distribution.

812
01:19:02,350 --> 01:19:06,580
With. I mentioned that we have a strategic national stockpile that has a whole bunch of stuff in it.

813
01:19:07,330 --> 01:19:14,889
Here in Massachusetts, you may know we had a really terrible first wave and you had some pretty terrible waves of COVID as well in Michigan.

814
01:19:14,890 --> 01:19:19,840
But we needed more than 400 ventilators from the strategic national stockpile

815
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:24,460
in our first wave in order to be able to to save lives in the COVID pandemic.

816
01:19:25,150 --> 01:19:29,830
One of the challenges was, again, the public health department who has the authority to distribute the ventilators,

817
01:19:29,830 --> 01:19:32,110
and they're actually the ones that received the ventilators from the federal government.

818
01:19:32,710 --> 01:19:36,280
They have no idea which I see who's need them, which I see as could use them.

819
01:19:36,790 --> 01:19:39,100
Not every ICU can use the same kind of ventilator.

820
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:45,610
And so we had to create response systems on the fire between our public health coalitions, our our health care coalitions,

821
01:19:45,650 --> 01:19:53,050
our health response organizations, and the public health department to make sure that the material gets into the right place at the right time.

822
01:19:53,920 --> 01:20:00,280
Other systems had to use this for PPE distribution when n95s or gowns or gloves were in short supply.

823
01:20:01,810 --> 01:20:05,290
So again, right now, most all of this is distributed just in the private sector.

824
01:20:05,290 --> 01:20:12,460
This is with vendors and distributors. During a disaster, we really have to do, I think, more of a whole community way to make sure that, you know,

825
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:17,530
especially critical access hospitals or safety net hospitals that have much more limited

826
01:20:17,530 --> 01:20:21,069
budgets may have trouble acquiring these things the same as big health systems.

827
01:20:21,070 --> 01:20:27,100
And I work for a big health system that make sure that everybody gets equal access to them so that everybody is equally protected.

828
01:20:28,330 --> 01:20:38,260
So this is the essence. There's a lot of stuff in there, including some vaccines, as well as a lot of just medical care supplies.

829
01:20:40,640 --> 01:20:50,360
At this point in COVID, you're very familiar with Non-Pharmaceutical interventions or NPIs and how we try and slow the spread of illness

830
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:55,670
so that we ideally can either distribute or develop medical countermeasures that will allow us to respond.

831
01:20:57,020 --> 01:21:03,230
Again, unfortunately, this has been extraordinarily politicized, I think partially or a lot because of the economic consequences of viruses.

832
01:21:03,530 --> 01:21:05,070
But but, you know,

833
01:21:05,150 --> 01:21:13,280
I think we've got to put a lot of focused effort into remembering why we have them and the life saving benefits of NPIs when we need them.

834
01:21:13,640 --> 01:21:18,290
So that so that, again, they don't seem like they're a political tool. They really are a health response tool.

835
01:21:20,580 --> 01:21:24,430
Lastly, you know. Responder.

836
01:21:24,430 --> 01:21:30,700
Health and safety is really, really important, whether it's EMS or health care or others.

837
01:21:31,660 --> 01:21:36,840
You know, we saw a lot of people with a lot of concerns about their health and safety during the COVID response.

838
01:21:36,850 --> 01:21:42,790
And I think we're going to continue to find it hard to sustain effective emergency responses if people

839
01:21:43,090 --> 01:21:47,829
increasingly feel like they're putting their life and safety on the line in order to participate in the response.

840
01:21:47,830 --> 01:21:55,720
And we have to do a better job toward entering public health and health care, of getting good guidance about what the right PPE is to wear.

841
01:21:56,020 --> 01:22:02,680
Of training people better. But then also working with the supply chain to make sure that the required PPE is is in fact, available.

842
01:22:03,730 --> 01:22:05,800
So I will stop there. I know we're getting right to time.

843
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:13,510
I don't know if there are any last minute questions, but I know that was a ridiculous amount of bureaucracy and acronyms and agencies and stuff.

844
01:22:13,510 --> 01:22:19,150
But I hope at least I gave you a bit of a framework to let you know sort of how it's supposed to fit together.

845
01:22:20,140 --> 01:22:25,630
And hopefully at least some of you will help make it better so that we fix the problems that we have.

846
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:31,030
Thank you so much for being here. Definitely a more comprehensive overview than I could have given.

847
01:22:31,060 --> 01:22:37,719
I do have a question for you. So we we I mentioned and DMS and you know the concept.

848
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:42,070
So for the national disaster medical system which is under Asper,

849
01:22:42,370 --> 01:22:50,259
these are like health care providers and veterinarians who essentially opt to participate in these teams.

850
01:22:50,260 --> 01:22:56,799
So as we're hearing, Dr. BIDDINGER, if you could like kind of just briefly talk about maybe like things you've done when

851
01:22:56,800 --> 01:23:01,150
you were deployed and what that was maybe like your most challenging deployment?

852
01:23:01,450 --> 01:23:04,509
Sure. Yeah. So so, yeah.

853
01:23:04,510 --> 01:23:07,360
So the National Disaster Medical System has a whole bunch of different things to it.

854
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:15,960
It was originally developed in the eighties to mostly care for war fighters overseas who would be injured and come back.

855
01:23:15,970 --> 01:23:22,780
But more. It's become a civil defense kind of mechanism. It has these things called disaster medical assistance teams, the outs and I'm on one,

856
01:23:23,320 --> 01:23:26,860
but it also has a bunch of other stuff related to patient movement and response and they're whole

857
01:23:26,860 --> 01:23:31,750
bunch of hospitals that that sign up to be part of the and DMS to receive patients if needed.

858
01:23:32,770 --> 01:23:36,339
Kind of the hardest or maybe good illustrative experience is hurricane.

859
01:23:36,340 --> 01:23:42,670
I think it's Irma. I get the names that hurricanes confuse, but it struck the Florida Keys and really decimated them.

860
01:23:43,450 --> 01:23:48,220
And there was no hospital in the Florida Keys that that was functioning anymore.

861
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:51,040
The last functioning hospital,

862
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:58,390
normally there are four normally the the last hospital was functioning was on the mainland of Florida, a little bit south of Miami.

863
01:23:58,870 --> 01:24:01,989
So we went down about half way in the middle of the Florida Keys goes down.

864
01:24:01,990 --> 01:24:05,650
That was just chain of islands off the south coast of Florida and sort of goes towards the west.

865
01:24:06,580 --> 01:24:11,290
And I can't remember it's probably emails a long hundred miles long or something like that.

866
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:17,920
And we were in Marathon, you're in the middle of the Florida Keys and the hospital was completely devastated there.

867
01:24:18,340 --> 01:24:20,950
And we were essentially the only open medical facility.

868
01:24:20,950 --> 01:24:27,849
We opened a tent hospital, the only hospital in the middle of the Florida Keys for about a week or so.

869
01:24:27,850 --> 01:24:33,639
And so anybody who had any sort of medical complaint, there were people that were supposed to be evacuated, but a lot of people didn't.

870
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:39,219
And some people went back. We were the tent hospital, the medical care site.

871
01:24:39,220 --> 01:24:45,610
And, you know, what's really just challenging is how to create or recreate what was,

872
01:24:46,090 --> 01:24:51,129
you know, a moderately robust medical infrastructure in a tent, you know, and set it out.

873
01:24:51,130 --> 01:24:55,780
We we deployed about where we were pre-deployed. We were pre-positioned in Orlando.

874
01:24:55,780 --> 01:25:02,379
Ironically, the hurricane went right over us as it left the keys when we went down where we were supposed to be safe.

875
01:25:02,380 --> 01:25:07,540
But we went down in about 24 hours, set up a tent hospital to be able to care for folks.

876
01:25:07,540 --> 01:25:12,910
And, you know, the challenging thing is, is there's only so much you can do.

877
01:25:13,990 --> 01:25:20,139
And you were trying to provide a level of care that is equivalent to what was destroyed before the hurricane.

878
01:25:20,140 --> 01:25:27,040
You cannot and you do your very best. And even at times, you know, the medical evacuation resources are limited.

879
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:32,559
How quickly can get helicopters to and from where we are or get ambulances to where we are if

880
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:37,480
we need to stabilize people and ship them to actual hospitals that that haven't been damaged,

881
01:25:38,710 --> 01:25:42,670
it requires you to make some prioritization choices and to.

882
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:51,910
You know, do your best to provide care in Wall Street setting. Oh, thank you.

883
01:25:51,940 --> 01:25:57,249
Thank you. I am sure you have many stories to tell and maybe another time.

884
01:25:57,250 --> 01:25:59,440
But I do want to be mindful of the time.

885
01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:08,679
So if we could all give like a clap or a virtual like a thank you so much to Dr. BIDDINGER for your time and actually for.

886
01:26:08,680 --> 01:26:12,220
Would you be willing to share your slides? Yes.

887
01:26:13,090 --> 01:26:19,660
I'll send it over to you. Okay. Perfect. Perfect. Well, thank you so much again for this comprehensive overview.

888
01:26:20,290 --> 01:26:23,440
Class, we will meet again in person on Tuesday.

889
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:29,590
And remember that your first quiz is due Sunday, Sunday night on campus.

890
01:26:29,890 --> 01:26:33,990
So remember one shot only, not one sitting.

891
01:26:34,190 --> 01:26:39,580
You know, all that good stuff. Don't refresh your browser. So thank you again so much, Dr. BIDDINGER.

892
01:26:40,240 --> 01:26:43,270
All right. Nice to see everybody. Thanks so much for. Thanks. Bye.
