1
00:00:02,435 --> 00:00:05,422
All right, good morning everyone,

2
00:00:05,422 --> 00:00:10,249
we are back to finish off Lab Zero for the [INAUDIBLE] 521.

3
00:00:10,249 --> 00:00:16,085
So last time, we worked our way through most of this lab tutorial, okay?

4
00:00:16,085 --> 00:00:21,036
So I'm using the environmental health science data set, you should be using

5
00:00:21,036 --> 00:00:26,160
whichever one you're gonna use for the labs, the code will be the same, okay?

6
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,293
The numbers and the pictures that you get might be slightly different, but

7
00:00:30,293 --> 00:00:31,614
that's okay, right?

8
00:00:31,614 --> 00:00:37,033
So the place we left off was we had read in our data set, right, that looked like

9
00:00:37,033 --> 00:00:42,811
this, we had a variety of variables and we started to look at various plots of them.

10
00:00:42,811 --> 00:00:46,932
So we've made some histograms, we've made some box plots,

11
00:00:46,932 --> 00:00:51,527
we computed some descriptive statistics, we made some bar plots for

12
00:00:51,527 --> 00:00:55,825
categorical variables and we also ordered a ordinal variable.

13
00:00:55,825 --> 00:01:02,783
So in my case, I believe it was this diet quality there, a diet, is it diet quality?

14
00:01:02,783 --> 00:01:05,930
I believe it was diet quality.

15
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:08,059
Yeah, diet quality, correct, right?

16
00:01:08,059 --> 00:01:12,442
So that we would have these, our bar plot would be lined up in the order that

17
00:01:12,442 --> 00:01:15,281
makes sense, instead of alphabetical order.

18
00:01:15,281 --> 00:01:19,578
So the next thing we're gonna do to finish off sort of the copy paste portion of this

19
00:01:19,578 --> 00:01:23,780
lab is we're gonna look at how to create a new variable if we want to, all right.

20
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:29,819
So the idea here the setup is that, I have an age variable.

21
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:33,423
Actually I need to need to rename my age variable.

22
00:01:33,423 --> 00:01:36,044
So if I run my previous code.

23
00:01:36,044 --> 00:01:41,095
So as a reminder, if you want to rename a variable,

24
00:01:41,095 --> 00:01:44,276
do it with the rename function.

25
00:01:44,276 --> 00:01:49,805
So if you tell it it's the variable of data I want it to be called AGE.

26
00:01:49,805 --> 00:01:55,646
And it was originally called RIDAGEYR.

27
00:02:01,245 --> 00:02:06,557
I'll run that command and you can see how my name for age changes.

28
00:02:06,557 --> 00:02:09,558
You should have done this last time, I'm just repeating this stuff.

29
00:02:09,558 --> 00:02:17,526
So imagine that I want to capture who in this data set is over, say age 50, right?

30
00:02:17,526 --> 00:02:19,298
So how could I do that?

31
00:02:19,298 --> 00:02:23,980
Well, one way I could do is I could create a new variable that's a binary variable.

32
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:28,647
Takes on values of 0 and 1, it's 0 if the person is less than 50 and

33
00:02:28,647 --> 00:02:31,829
it's 1 if the person is over 50, all right?

34
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:34,608
So the way we can do that is we can use something called the mutate

35
00:02:34,608 --> 00:02:35,512
function, right?

36
00:02:35,512 --> 00:02:39,966
So if we go into this copy and paste area, so the function is called mutate,

37
00:02:39,966 --> 00:02:44,796
because what we're gonna do is we're gonna take this original data set, okay?

38
00:02:44,796 --> 00:02:50,291
We're gonna mutate it by adding on another column to it.

39
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:54,842
The first thing you pass it is the name of the data set that you wanna use, okay?

40
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:59,848
This age 50 is the name of the new variable that you're creating, okay?

41
00:02:59,848 --> 00:03:02,950
And then you need sort of a definition or a recipe for

42
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:06,355
how you're going to create that variable, all right?

43
00:03:06,355 --> 00:03:09,013
So we're gonna use for this another function,

44
00:03:09,013 --> 00:03:11,476
it's called the if else function, right?

45
00:03:11,476 --> 00:03:16,802
So if you have just a logic thing, that if else function has three arguments.

46
00:03:16,802 --> 00:03:19,521
The first one is some condition, okay?

47
00:03:19,521 --> 00:03:23,287
So we're looking at the condition age greater than or equal to 50.

48
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:27,187
So what it's doing is it's going down each row and it's looking to see, okay,

49
00:03:27,187 --> 00:03:29,007
is age greater than or equal to 50?

50
00:03:29,007 --> 00:03:34,757
No, if it's not, okay, the answer to that question is yes, you put in the value for

51
00:03:34,757 --> 00:03:40,025
the first thing, if the answer is no you put in the value for the second thing.

52
00:03:40,025 --> 00:03:40,955
That makes sense?

53
00:03:40,955 --> 00:03:43,215
So it just all packaged up together, right?

54
00:03:43,215 --> 00:03:45,539
But just go ahead and take that and copy and paste it in.

55
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:52,827
>> [COUGH] >> Here

56
00:03:52,827 --> 00:03:58,189
are my script, running from there.

57
00:03:58,189 --> 00:04:03,385
Now you should have in your data set you should see this new column age 50 pop up.

58
00:04:03,385 --> 00:04:05,706
All right, sense?

59
00:04:05,706 --> 00:04:10,386
So that's the mutate part, the mutate added on a new column,

60
00:04:10,386 --> 00:04:13,458
a new variable and we caught it, right?

61
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:20,199
This piece right here is catching it and sort of saving it to the data file.

62
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:21,843
Right, as you go down, right, just look.

63
00:04:21,843 --> 00:04:27,968
So in my example, right, this first person is 42, they get a 0, 15, 0, 45 0.

64
00:04:27,968 --> 00:04:32,038
Here's our first person over age 50, so age 67 gets a 1, right?

65
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:35,987
So now I've created this new binary variable or

66
00:04:35,987 --> 00:04:41,332
I can easily identify who is greater than age 50 in my data set.

67
00:04:41,332 --> 00:04:46,447
And if I wanna get some kind of summary of that, well,

68
00:04:46,447 --> 00:04:52,813
we used this table function before if I just have a counted zeros and

69
00:04:52,813 --> 00:04:58,519
ones or I can just type in table and down here it will return.

70
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:04,921
Here's the number of zeros 1195, here's the number of ones,

71
00:05:04,921 --> 00:05:11,004
so there's 798 people over age 50 in this data set, okay?

72
00:05:11,004 --> 00:05:15,904
And I've made a variable that captured that so I was able to reuse it,

73
00:05:15,904 --> 00:05:16,927
makes sense?

74
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,889
Any questions?

75
00:05:18,889 --> 00:05:23,524
All right, so what I've showed you is in this

76
00:05:23,524 --> 00:05:29,023
tutorial is the basics to get you started, correct.

77
00:05:29,023 --> 00:05:32,712
The big thing about coding is when you're learning first,

78
00:05:32,712 --> 00:05:34,867
you start with copy paste, okay?

79
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:38,505
You sometimes don't exactly understand what's going on when you're doing the copy

80
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:40,283
paste, but you work your way through it.

81
00:05:40,283 --> 00:05:43,901
And then you start to answer some questions where you take those original

82
00:05:43,901 --> 00:05:45,620
lines of code that you worked on and

83
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:49,140
you learn how to tweak them slightly to answer new questions, right?

84
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,930
And then the end goal is that you can just write your own code,

85
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:55,775
you can start from scratch, you don't have to be copying and pasting everything.

86
00:05:55,775 --> 00:06:00,261
But there is a lot of copying and pasting that gets done in coding,

87
00:06:00,261 --> 00:06:01,902
right, the same time.

88
00:06:01,902 --> 00:06:06,043
All right, so again, these questions are the same regardless of which lab you're

89
00:06:06,043 --> 00:06:08,783
working on but you'll be working in your own data set.

90
00:06:08,783 --> 00:06:12,793
So your actual answers that gets spit out might be slightly different.

91
00:06:12,793 --> 00:06:17,836
Okay, so each data set contains a variable for self reported race.

92
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:24,601
First thing I want you to do is rename that variable to simply race, okay?

93
00:06:24,601 --> 00:06:28,640
And then is there any need to order the levels of the race variable?

94
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,437
Why?

95
00:06:29,437 --> 00:06:34,635
So this is going back to, if you remember up here, when we first looked at

96
00:06:34,635 --> 00:06:39,858
categorical variables, I looked at diet quality of my data set, okay?

97
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:42,162
So I had to order them because it was an ordinal variable.

98
00:06:42,162 --> 00:06:44,659
>> [COUGH] >> So

99
00:06:44,659 --> 00:06:47,735
the first thing we wanna do is we wanna.

100
00:06:52,638 --> 00:06:55,780
Rename the race variable in this dataset,

101
00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:00,415
I always type variable wrong, I spelled wrong the first time.

102
00:07:00,415 --> 00:07:05,292
So this one is, if you remember, actually I have the code right here,

103
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:06,789
so I'll just run it.

104
00:07:06,789 --> 00:07:10,993
This was the code we used to rename the age variable, right?

105
00:07:10,993 --> 00:07:15,354
Okay, so the idea is you take that what you need, okay?

106
00:07:15,354 --> 00:07:19,559
So we need this rename part, paste that.

107
00:07:19,559 --> 00:07:23,057
We're gonna work on the dataset again, okay?

108
00:07:23,057 --> 00:07:27,101
So now we wanna save this as just simply race.

109
00:07:27,101 --> 00:07:30,180
That's gonna be our new variable name, okay?

110
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:33,116
And what was the one that it's originally saved as in the data set?

111
00:07:33,116 --> 00:07:41,204
So it's this very tough to remember RIDRETH3.

112
00:07:41,204 --> 00:07:44,083
So again, I don't know exactly what it stands for but

113
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:46,454
that's based on N Haines surveys, right?

114
00:07:46,454 --> 00:07:50,091
They store, I remember I showed in the lecture they started this next separately.

115
00:07:50,091 --> 00:07:52,862
So all we have to do is you RIDRETH3.

116
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:59,661
This should run, here we go.

117
00:07:59,661 --> 00:08:04,690
So then if I go back and look up top very nicely it's done, right?

118
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:05,755
So I've renamed it.

119
00:08:05,755 --> 00:08:09,153
If you go back to this data file and it and it hasn't updated the name,

120
00:08:09,153 --> 00:08:10,687
sometimes you need to do this.

121
00:08:10,687 --> 00:08:15,174
Sometimes you need to close it and then just click update again and

122
00:08:15,174 --> 00:08:16,489
it should update.

123
00:08:16,489 --> 00:08:19,975
Sometimes depending on your version of R or whatever,

124
00:08:19,975 --> 00:08:22,871
sometimes it lags a little bit there, okay?

125
00:08:22,871 --> 00:08:27,242
So let's take a look how do we look at data in a categorical variable?

126
00:08:27,242 --> 00:08:32,369
Well, the simplest way to to take a look is to do this table function, right?

127
00:08:32,369 --> 00:08:37,863
That'll take that whole row of data for the race variable.

128
00:08:37,863 --> 00:08:40,557
It'll find all the different options that exist for it and

129
00:08:40,557 --> 00:08:41,878
it'll count them up for me.

130
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:48,594
Okay.

131
00:08:52,977 --> 00:08:57,750
What this is telling me is that there are one, two, three,

132
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,621
four, five, six options, okay?

133
00:09:00,621 --> 00:09:02,421
This is based on the enhanced survey, okay?

134
00:09:02,421 --> 00:09:05,645
This is how they collected this information.

135
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:09,068
Is this an ordinal or nominal variable?

136
00:09:09,068 --> 00:09:10,039
>> Nominal. >> Nominal, right, so

137
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:12,749
we don't have to do anything with using that border function, right?

138
00:09:12,749 --> 00:09:13,904
This thing is fine as is.

139
00:09:23,551 --> 00:09:27,482
Okay, so that answers question one.

140
00:09:27,482 --> 00:09:31,562
One way you might want to do this is,

141
00:09:31,562 --> 00:09:37,558
in your R script, you could do something like this.

142
00:09:37,558 --> 00:09:39,861
You can break your code right in there, right?

143
00:09:39,861 --> 00:09:44,846
You could type your answer.

144
00:09:44,846 --> 00:09:49,173
Race is a nominal variable,

145
00:09:49,173 --> 00:09:53,497
so we do not need to order it,

146
00:09:53,497 --> 00:09:58,202
something like this, right?

147
00:09:58,202 --> 00:10:03,074
So you can submit, this can help you with submitting your code and your answers.

148
00:10:10,962 --> 00:10:14,454
So the second question, how many levels are included in the race variable?

149
00:10:14,454 --> 00:10:18,871
One of the proportions for each group in your data set.

150
00:10:18,871 --> 00:10:22,383
Okay, well, we already made this table and we saw that there are six levels.

151
00:10:29,575 --> 00:10:33,120
Right, and how can we look at the proportions?

152
00:10:36,347 --> 00:10:39,192
All right, you have to leave it, if you write,

153
00:10:39,192 --> 00:10:42,268
if you write an answer, it has to be commented out.

154
00:10:42,268 --> 00:10:48,723
So, that's what can make this a little bit tricky, right, otherwise Okay,

155
00:10:48,723 --> 00:10:53,379
so again, we made a table of counts, this is asking for proportions.

156
00:10:53,379 --> 00:10:58,529
If you go back into this tutorial document,

157
00:10:58,529 --> 00:11:05,355
we did this already, we looked at proportions over here.

158
00:11:05,355 --> 00:11:10,977
So right here, remember what we did when we were looking at the sex variable,

159
00:11:10,977 --> 00:11:16,772
is first we passed the table that sort of collapsed all the data into the counts,

160
00:11:16,772 --> 00:11:17,395
right?

161
00:11:17,395 --> 00:11:19,459
So told me that here's how many labels?

162
00:11:19,459 --> 00:11:20,392
So, are there some counts?

163
00:11:20,392 --> 00:11:24,556
There are, and then you pass those counts to something called prop.table.

164
00:11:24,556 --> 00:11:27,922
So proportion table, okay?

165
00:11:27,922 --> 00:11:28,751
And that's what we're gonna do.

166
00:11:28,751 --> 00:11:34,700
So you can do this, type it from scratch or you can just grab this whole piece

167
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:40,191
of code right here, copy that, bring it over to R, place it in here.

168
00:11:40,191 --> 00:11:41,834
Now this is what I'm talking about,

169
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:44,222
where you've gotta make just simple changes right?

170
00:11:44,222 --> 00:11:48,918
Now, I don't wanna ask you to do this on that gender sex variable.

171
00:11:48,918 --> 00:11:53,374
What I want this to do this on is the race variable, right?

172
00:11:53,374 --> 00:11:56,232
So how do I tell it to do it on a different variable?

173
00:11:56,232 --> 00:12:00,149
Well I just change the variable that's after that dollar sign, right?

174
00:12:00,149 --> 00:12:03,338
So can enter on that.

175
00:12:03,338 --> 00:12:06,089
There you go, right, so now instead of counts, I have proportions.

176
00:12:11,425 --> 00:12:17,179
If you want, you can, I'll be there Sammy.

177
00:12:17,179 --> 00:12:22,445
That's what the output looks like.

178
00:12:25,037 --> 00:12:26,708
Questions?

179
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:29,650
You see what I mean by now, just making little changes in the lines of code,

180
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:30,174
[INAUDIBLE]?

181
00:12:41,025 --> 00:12:44,524
Correct, so

182
00:12:44,524 --> 00:12:48,981
next question.

183
00:12:48,981 --> 00:12:53,154
Compute the mean standard deviation and five number summary for

184
00:12:53,154 --> 00:12:55,402
the BMI variable in your data set.

185
00:12:55,402 --> 00:12:59,333
Okay, so this is what descriptive statistics is now.

186
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:01,754
So if we go back to our dataset.

187
00:13:01,754 --> 00:13:07,729
So first you have to find where BMI is, it's BMX BMI, that's not that bad.

188
00:13:07,729 --> 00:13:13,239
But if it's me, I wanna clean that up a little bit, so I'm just gonna rename it.

189
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:24,361
This just takes a second bmi = BMXBMI.

190
00:13:24,361 --> 00:13:27,033
Okay, so now I've got to select a simpler name, right?

191
00:13:27,033 --> 00:13:30,624
And that a couple times already,

192
00:13:30,624 --> 00:13:34,855
remember what we can use to compute mean

193
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:39,740
standard deviation, five number summary?

194
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:42,112
You may remember what the command was?

195
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:43,637
What was the command?

196
00:13:43,637 --> 00:13:50,923
>> [INAUDIBLE] standard deviation [INAUDIBLE].

197
00:13:50,923 --> 00:13:52,177
>> Summary, exactly, right.

198
00:13:52,177 --> 00:13:52,939
>> [LAUGH] >> Yeah, I know.

199
00:13:52,939 --> 00:13:57,386
Good, so I'll start with this, I'm gonna do summary first, right?

200
00:13:57,386 --> 00:14:02,534
So now I'll just tell it,

201
00:14:02,534 --> 00:14:06,749
DATA$bmi, right?

202
00:14:06,749 --> 00:14:09,859
So there's my five no summary plus, I get the mean for free, so

203
00:14:09,859 --> 00:14:13,641
I don't even have to compute the mean separately, okay, so that's good.

204
00:14:13,641 --> 00:14:16,848
And like you said, SD was for

205
00:14:16,848 --> 00:14:22,068
standard deviation, so that's DATA$bmi.

206
00:14:22,068 --> 00:14:24,219
What happened?

207
00:14:24,219 --> 00:14:26,627
>> You have to do the RN.

208
00:14:26,627 --> 00:14:27,742
>> Yeah, exactly, right?

209
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:29,331
There's missing values, right?

210
00:14:29,331 --> 00:14:34,433
For BMI, so I have

211
00:14:34,433 --> 00:14:41,583
to do the na.rn=TRUE.

212
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:42,083
There we go.

213
00:14:45,153 --> 00:14:51,702
This is sort of an aside, but if you want to ask yourself how many missing values?

214
00:14:51,702 --> 00:14:53,433
You could do something like this.

215
00:14:53,433 --> 00:15:00,610
So if you wanna know whether a value is missing is .na.

216
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:03,388
it's not na will tell you,

217
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,087
It'll go down the road be my values and

218
00:15:13,087 --> 00:15:18,892
it'll tell you it'll be one of the values missing, it'll be a zero if it's not.

219
00:15:18,892 --> 00:15:24,200
If I do some of that it'll just add up the ones that are true.

220
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,306
Okay, so as returns to me at 16 so

221
00:15:27,306 --> 00:15:33,220
that's telling me they're 16 missing values for bmi, okay.

222
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:36,424
So what I'm doing here is this is the cool thing about r,

223
00:15:36,424 --> 00:15:39,440
cool if you like programming and you can get into it.

224
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,927
But you see I'm starting to build on top of each other,

225
00:15:41,927 --> 00:15:43,941
right these different functions, right?

226
00:15:43,941 --> 00:15:47,888
And so in one line of code I can do some fairly complicated things, okay and

227
00:15:47,888 --> 00:15:50,827
we're just scratching the surface on what you can do.

228
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:57,403
All right, very good, so that was question number three,

229
00:15:57,403 --> 00:15:59,442
all right question number four.

230
00:15:59,442 --> 00:16:02,526
Based on the descriptive statistics for bmi,

231
00:16:02,526 --> 00:16:06,920
do you have any concerns about potential outlier values?

232
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:11,556
All right so this one is going to depend on your

233
00:16:11,556 --> 00:16:17,610
specific data set but we can use the same logic here.

234
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:19,851
I have my five number summary right here,

235
00:16:19,851 --> 00:16:22,600
no look at this notice I didn't even realize this.

236
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,860
The five number summary actually gave you the number of missing values right in it.

237
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:30,090
Right so I just confirmed it, there you go somebody could help that out told me.

238
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:35,177
All right, so if I look at my five number summary,

239
00:16:35,177 --> 00:16:40,770
any concern about outliers or extreme measurements.

240
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:45,863
Where would you be looking in the five number summary to

241
00:16:45,863 --> 00:16:50,967
be thinking about extreme measurements or outliers?

242
00:16:50,967 --> 00:16:52,028
>> The max.

243
00:16:52,028 --> 00:16:54,286
>> The max and the mid, right?

244
00:16:54,286 --> 00:16:57,866
If you're an extreme value, you either have to sit way off to the left or

245
00:16:57,866 --> 00:16:59,371
way off to the right, right.

246
00:16:59,371 --> 00:17:04,271
And if there's an outlier it's got to be the men or the max, right?

247
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:10,980
So and out back up here an outlier

248
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:17,493
would need to be the min or max value.

249
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:26,081
So this is where it's gonna be a little bit different in everybody's dataset.

250
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:30,962
So if I'm looking at mine, my minimum bmi is 14,

251
00:17:30,962 --> 00:17:35,367
this is where you might have to break out of like a chart look and

252
00:17:35,367 --> 00:17:38,866
see what bmi is look like, it's so cold in here.

253
00:17:38,866 --> 00:17:39,555
>> Yeah.

254
00:17:39,555 --> 00:17:45,201
>> [LAUGH] So 14, so remember we've got some younger people in here, right.

255
00:17:45,201 --> 00:17:47,385
So bmi of 14 they got on the lowest side but

256
00:17:47,385 --> 00:17:50,431
I don't think it's certainly not negative four, right?

257
00:17:50,431 --> 00:17:53,813
It's not biologically impossible, it's pretty low,

258
00:17:53,813 --> 00:17:58,920
right but we've got some younger some teenagers and stuff in here, so okay.

259
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:03,093
A max of 64.5 is that

260
00:18:03,093 --> 00:18:07,901
biologically plausible?

261
00:18:07,901 --> 00:18:08,550
>> Yeah.

262
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:14,187
>> Yeah, I mean it is, it's high for sure, if you look in a large group of people,

263
00:18:14,187 --> 00:18:19,010
thousands of people are you gonna get some larger values like that?

264
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:23,550
You will, you'll get extreme values, it's not 4000, right?

265
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:27,066
I'd be worried about 4000, right because the stuff I do electronic health

266
00:18:27,066 --> 00:18:29,651
records stuff, you do see weird stuff like that, right?

267
00:18:29,651 --> 00:18:34,281
And the reason why it's often cuz like sometimes somebody

268
00:18:34,281 --> 00:18:37,692
enters something in like feet and pounds.

269
00:18:37,692 --> 00:18:42,980
Or inches and pounds instead of grams and centimeters like this, right?

270
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:46,668
And there's like these unit conversions and you get these like crazy numbers,

271
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:49,101
right and this is the way you can catch them, right?

272
00:18:49,101 --> 00:18:51,823
So here I might wanna look here and

273
00:18:51,823 --> 00:18:55,830
see like are there lots of people in the sixties.

274
00:18:55,830 --> 00:19:00,121
But I don't think so because I can see this the rest of my distribution.

275
00:19:00,121 --> 00:19:03,822
So, I don't have any major concerns here,

276
00:19:03,822 --> 00:19:07,840
I do see some a very small value, a large value.

277
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:13,456
We can't immediately exclude them because they're say less than zero or

278
00:19:13,456 --> 00:19:17,190
absurdly high within the realm of possibility.

279
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:20,831
So I don't think there's any concern in my specific dataset,

280
00:19:20,831 --> 00:19:23,041
does anybody see something in there?

281
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:27,856
So I don't know what episode or nutrition look like, yeah.

282
00:19:27,856 --> 00:19:30,170
>> I have a max is 130.

283
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:33,489
>> So that one might be concerning, right?

284
00:19:33,489 --> 00:19:34,507
>> Yeah.

285
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:39,168
>> So that might be one that you need to think about what data set are you

286
00:19:39,168 --> 00:19:40,094
looking at?

287
00:19:40,094 --> 00:19:44,497
>> I think was

288
00:19:44,497 --> 00:19:49,622
max, so >> That's fine.

289
00:19:53,014 --> 00:19:56,481
So that's one we might need to drop forever, right?

290
00:19:56,481 --> 00:19:58,307
That one seems unrealistic,

291
00:19:58,307 --> 00:20:02,542
that might be something that's the results of a measurement there,

292
00:20:02,542 --> 00:20:07,700
nutrition anybody looking at nutrition, any nutrition people in here?

293
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:08,662
Okay.

294
00:20:10,691 --> 00:20:14,541
Right, so I'll just say for

295
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:18,714
HS neither value certain, for

296
00:20:18,714 --> 00:20:24,810
your data set I would point out that 130 and

297
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:29,640
say that might be one we wanna drop.

298
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:44,000
All right, question five, everybody good on that one?

299
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,230
Let's move along.

300
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:50,294
Yeah, question five, based on the descriptive statistics of bmi,

301
00:20:50,294 --> 00:20:55,444
do you think the distribution for bmi is most likely to be left skewed,

302
00:20:55,444 --> 00:20:58,770
right skewed or symmetric, why?

303
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:02,281
Okay, so we'll go back to our descriptive statistics.

304
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:09,741
So, I'm looking at this one, what should I be looking at for skewness?

305
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,646
>> Mean versus median. >> Mean versus median it's usually a good

306
00:21:14,646 --> 00:21:16,183
thing to look at, right?

307
00:21:16,183 --> 00:21:19,480
You can also there's a couple things you can look at,

308
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,123
sometimes you can look at like how far out.

309
00:21:22,123 --> 00:21:26,095
Your max and your min r from your first quartile and your third quartile but

310
00:21:26,095 --> 00:21:30,590
yeah, the first place you should be looking for sure is mean and median.

311
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:31,711
What's going on here?

312
00:21:31,711 --> 00:21:36,447
So my mean is greater than my median, so

313
00:21:36,447 --> 00:21:40,327
what do I think this is gonna be?

314
00:21:40,327 --> 00:21:44,322
Think about it this way, imagine facing it, my mean is this way so

315
00:21:44,322 --> 00:21:49,280
that means the tail had to be pulled on this side so that's right skewed, right.

316
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:49,780
Okay hold on one sec.

317
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:59,580
I'm gonna put the word probably in here because remember we said the descriptive

318
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:03,124
statistics, they don't tell you exactly what's going on.

319
00:22:03,124 --> 00:22:07,701
Right gives you some clue as to what's going on, did you have a question?

320
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:12,565
>> Yeah, so I was just wondering what is the range in which you can assume that is

321
00:22:12,565 --> 00:22:17,961
symmetric because it's off by one point, so does it have to be literary gives that?

322
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:23,512
>> Yeah, so it won't be exactly, right so part of this depends, is a great question,

323
00:22:23,512 --> 00:22:28,383
part of this depends on what the scale that you're looking at is, right?

324
00:22:28,383 --> 00:22:35,580
So bmi, a one point jump in bmi is not a trivial jump, right?

325
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:40,100
So that's kind of what you have to be thinking about a little bit too.

326
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,468
I agree these are fairly close,

327
00:22:42,468 --> 00:22:47,829
part of the reason I sort of hedged a little bit by putting probably here.

328
00:22:47,829 --> 00:22:52,824
Is because yeah I wouldn't bet my house that this thing is definitely

329
00:22:52,824 --> 00:22:54,901
right skewed based on this.

330
00:22:54,901 --> 00:23:00,256
But if it is skewed I think it's probably skewed to the right, okay.

331
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:06,635
So following up on this, right,

332
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:11,805
confirm your answer to the previous question by creating

333
00:23:11,805 --> 00:23:17,311
the appropriate plot to visualize the distribution of bmi.

334
00:23:17,311 --> 00:23:18,901
Right, this is getting at this issue, right?

335
00:23:18,901 --> 00:23:23,091
I can look at the descriptive statistics and it makes me think something but

336
00:23:23,091 --> 00:23:25,570
let's confirm it, how would I confirm it?

337
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,912
I would need to confirm this thing,

338
00:23:28,912 --> 00:23:33,726
what plot can I make to look at the distribution of bmi?

339
00:23:33,726 --> 00:23:36,248
>> Histogram >> Histogram would be good,

340
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,340
what's another option?

341
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:42,290
Box plot would be fine too, probably wanna look at the histogram first to make sure

342
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:46,190
that it's unimodal, right and that box plot would make sense.

343
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:49,243
Does anybody remember the formation for histogram?

344
00:23:49,243 --> 00:23:50,472
>> Hissed.

345
00:23:50,472 --> 00:23:51,141
>> Hissed, very good.

346
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:54,344
Okay so start simple when you're doing these, so

347
00:23:54,344 --> 00:23:55,818
remember what do I have to pass it?

348
00:23:55,818 --> 00:24:00,460
I just have to pass it the variables that I wanna make.

349
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:05,110
Right, we know we can get this to work then we can pretty it up the labels and

350
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,128
all that later.

351
00:24:07,128 --> 00:24:11,298
There I go, so I can zoom in on that,

352
00:24:11,298 --> 00:24:17,001
I can move it around if I want, thoughts on this.

353
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:22,320
Does this confirm what I thought above?

354
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:27,086
It is, is it like a very strong right skew?

355
00:24:27,086 --> 00:24:32,141
I don't think so, right it's a sort of a subtle right skew part.

356
00:24:32,141 --> 00:24:36,187
I mean look at how much farther there's many more of these boxes that have these

357
00:24:36,187 --> 00:24:39,207
lower values on the right side than the left side, right?

358
00:24:45,384 --> 00:24:53,341
Another thing to note here is that you can't have bmi less than zero, right?

359
00:24:53,341 --> 00:24:57,450
So there's this like natural lower bound on your bmi anyway.

360
00:24:57,450 --> 00:25:01,380
And so there's only so far they can go to this direction, right?

361
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:05,271
Whereas they can sort of a little bit more space to spread out here, right?

362
00:25:05,271 --> 00:25:07,898
It gets to be like sort of impossible to some degree but yeah,

363
00:25:07,898 --> 00:25:09,660
they've got more room to move out here.

364
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:14,394
And when you have that situation that's almost always gonna lead to skewing away

365
00:25:14,394 --> 00:25:17,259
from wherever your natural boundary is, okay.

366
00:25:22,142 --> 00:25:28,490
And then just to show like you can do basic stuff here, you can do color equals.

367
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:35,053
I said my favorite color is blue, I love this cadet blue color, I don't know why.

368
00:25:35,053 --> 00:25:37,609
Man, let's take a minute.

369
00:25:37,609 --> 00:25:41,037
>> [LAUGH] >> Let's take a minute here.

370
00:25:42,825 --> 00:25:48,631
So if you go to r, [NOISE] You are so

371
00:25:48,631 --> 00:25:54,460
here we go and r you want colors?

372
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:59,284
Look at this, you can get so all you gotta do

373
00:25:59,284 --> 00:26:04,121
is pick the color you like and just grab it.

374
00:26:04,121 --> 00:26:10,350
So you want magenta three, I'll do magenta three for you so you can put that in here.

375
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:13,806
Okay say I don't wanna main title on this,

376
00:26:13,806 --> 00:26:18,318
I can just get rid of it like that just put empty quotes and

377
00:26:18,318 --> 00:26:22,561
say I wanna do an X label and just have that basic bmi.

378
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:29,719
There you go and yes you are not limited,

379
00:26:29,719 --> 00:26:33,420
there are many many options.

380
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:39,890
Okay, so all you gotta do is search for r colors and you can find this thing.

381
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:41,931
>> You'll do like upload?

382
00:26:41,931 --> 00:26:46,057
>> No, this is all built right into r,

383
00:26:46,057 --> 00:26:51,020
so you can do any pick any different color.

384
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:55,535
Thistle one, we can go in here and we could say up and

385
00:26:55,535 --> 00:26:59,670
gentle was a little little much for me.

386
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:01,870
Let's do thistle one instead.

387
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:06,498
Actually that's not even showing up as nicely on here as

388
00:27:06,498 --> 00:27:11,425
it is on my screen but yeah, it's definitely got a bit of a.

389
00:27:11,425 --> 00:27:13,346
>> [LAUGH] >> What was that?

390
00:27:13,346 --> 00:27:14,621
>> He said it's so boring.

391
00:27:14,621 --> 00:27:20,121
>> Yeah, there you go, see it's not so bad learning r, all right.

392
00:27:20,121 --> 00:27:24,783
So that made my histogram,

393
00:27:24,783 --> 00:27:29,850
go back to magenta, okay, so

394
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:36,744
yes this confirms that the distribution

395
00:27:36,744 --> 00:27:41,421
is slightly right skewed.

396
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:46,486
People looking at other native sets, the applicator, that was just the same thing.

397
00:27:46,486 --> 00:27:47,279
>> Yeah.

398
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:50,956
>> Yeah most of the time when you look at something like bmi it's gonna look

399
00:27:50,956 --> 00:27:52,008
like that, right?

400
00:27:52,008 --> 00:27:57,729
For partially for the reasons I just described, it's capped on the lower

401
00:27:57,729 --> 00:28:03,465
end and you're gonna have that tail that goes off towards higher values.

402
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:11,740
All right, question number seven.

403
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:22,922
All right, we'll trick you here create a new variable called

404
00:28:22,922 --> 00:28:28,110
the log age containing the natural log rhythm of the age variable.

405
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:28,654
Okay, so

406
00:28:28,654 --> 00:28:32,676
sometimes you wanna take a function of a variable that we already had.

407
00:28:32,676 --> 00:28:37,638
So give me a hint here, if you wanna take a natural

408
00:28:37,638 --> 00:28:41,290
log you use log just a function log.

409
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:44,366
If you wanna take a log base 10 function it would be log 10,

410
00:28:44,366 --> 00:28:46,280
okay those are two different things.

411
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:49,836
Usually you use the natural log, okay?

412
00:28:49,836 --> 00:28:55,344
And so if you wanna do for example down here just

413
00:28:55,344 --> 00:29:02,839
just to show you remember like the test stuff out on the bottom.

414
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:07,462
So if I do log of the data, dollar sign age down

415
00:29:07,462 --> 00:29:12,099
here it'll show me, well I think that a lot.

416
00:29:12,099 --> 00:29:16,355
I think that was gonna print them all out but it did put them out a lot but

417
00:29:16,355 --> 00:29:21,068
you can see what it's doing is it's giving me the log values of age, right?

418
00:29:21,068 --> 00:29:26,944
So the first age is 42, so the log of 42 is 3.7,

419
00:29:26,944 --> 00:29:30,217
log of 15 is 2.7 change.

420
00:29:30,217 --> 00:29:35,292
Okay so now we just wanna what we just did right there we just wanna catch this,

421
00:29:35,292 --> 00:29:36,640
okay and save it so.

422
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,496
Okay so data equal for making a new variable,

423
00:29:39,496 --> 00:29:41,770
what do we start the class off with?

424
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:42,714
What was that? Remember

425
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:44,061
that function >> Mutate.

426
00:29:44,061 --> 00:29:48,011
>> Mutate good, so we use mutate, okay so

427
00:29:48,011 --> 00:29:52,338
we got to tell what data we're looking at.

428
00:29:52,338 --> 00:29:56,637
Often these are redundant you're saving it to the same but not always, okay,

429
00:29:56,637 --> 00:29:58,180
so we wanna call this thing.

430
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:00,123
log age.

431
00:30:00,123 --> 00:30:04,692
Remember that's the name of the variable thing that I'm gonna create and

432
00:30:04,692 --> 00:30:07,500
now I have to give it the definition, right?

433
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,557
Or the recipe for how you're gonna make that variable?

434
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:13,935
So that is logged each like that.

435
00:30:13,935 --> 00:30:17,889
Okay.

436
00:30:17,889 --> 00:30:22,355
So one thing I just want to point out here is that notice that when I ran it

437
00:30:22,355 --> 00:30:23,946
the console right here,

438
00:30:23,946 --> 00:30:29,053
I had to put data dollar sign age because there I had it doesn't know what age is.

439
00:30:29,053 --> 00:30:30,678
Right. I have to tell it where age lives.

440
00:30:30,678 --> 00:30:33,032
Right? The reason why I want you to go look for

441
00:30:33,032 --> 00:30:35,653
it when I do it within this mutate function.

442
00:30:35,653 --> 00:30:37,414
I've already told it where I wanted to look.

443
00:30:37,414 --> 00:30:40,376
So we know. So I don't need the data dollar sign age

444
00:30:40,376 --> 00:30:41,398
right there.

445
00:30:41,398 --> 00:30:45,918
That's why I want to make sure that that makes sense.

446
00:30:45,918 --> 00:30:51,425
So if we've done that, then fine go back to my data sets.

447
00:30:51,425 --> 00:30:56,952
You should see a new variable got tacked on right there.

448
00:30:56,952 --> 00:31:04,550
Okay.

449
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:09,830
Did you just show me

450
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:18,080
what the regular right here.

451
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,743
So, you know, if I just wanted to run that, you know,

452
00:31:21,743 --> 00:31:24,626
to compute the value outside, you could.

453
00:31:24,626 --> 00:31:25,930
Does that make sense to what I did there.

454
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:34,532
Right.

455
00:31:34,532 --> 00:31:38,165
You know, and it doesn't, you know, you can you can, you know, run it,

456
00:31:38,165 --> 00:31:39,748
run it on any anything, right?

457
00:31:39,748 --> 00:31:43,675
And you can run it on any number, right?

458
00:31:43,675 --> 00:31:45,010
We just ran it on.

459
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:46,740
Instead of running it on one number.

460
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:51,294
We ran it on the entire column of ages and

461
00:31:51,294 --> 00:31:58,207
then save that as a new variable called log age makes sense.

462
00:31:58,207 --> 00:32:02,388
All right.

463
00:32:02,388 --> 00:32:05,251
Question number eight.

464
00:32:05,251 --> 00:32:09,283
What does the distribution of your new variable?

465
00:32:09,283 --> 00:32:10,071
Who?

466
00:32:10,071 --> 00:32:11,116
That's not murdered properly.

467
00:32:11,116 --> 00:32:14,936
Should say what is the distribution of your new variable log age.

468
00:32:14,936 --> 00:32:16,287
Okay. So long gauges.

469
00:32:16,287 --> 00:32:19,251
A numerical variable.

470
00:32:19,251 --> 00:32:21,277
Right? So we want to make a list a gram or

471
00:32:21,277 --> 00:32:25,772
box plot and then compare it to the shape of the original age variable.

472
00:32:25,772 --> 00:32:28,384
And then just think about how to apply in the natural log function.

473
00:32:28,384 --> 00:32:30,427
Change the shape of the distribution.

474
00:32:30,427 --> 00:32:31,651
Okay. Have agents.

475
00:32:31,651 --> 00:32:33,119
All right, so let's do this.

476
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:37,916
We'll go back to our set up

477
00:32:37,916 --> 00:32:43,373
something for questioning.

478
00:32:43,373 --> 00:32:47,704
First thing I have to do is create a hissed a gram or

479
00:32:47,704 --> 00:32:53,003
box plot for the log age variables and we have a preference.

480
00:32:53,003 --> 00:32:57,337
I'm gonna create a box plot this time.

481
00:32:57,337 --> 00:33:01,611
The box plot of data, dollar sign log.

482
00:33:01,611 --> 00:33:04,186
See how it's see how it's It's it's looking for me.

483
00:33:04,186 --> 00:33:06,129
It helps me know I'm in the right spot.

484
00:33:06,129 --> 00:33:07,219
Go ahead and be lazy.

485
00:33:07,219 --> 00:33:09,673
Right? Just click it finished for you.

486
00:33:09,673 --> 00:33:15,995
If I hit enter on that, it's gonna show up right here.

487
00:33:15,995 --> 00:33:17,785
What's that distribution look like?

488
00:33:17,785 --> 00:33:19,321
Actually, let me help you.

489
00:33:19,321 --> 00:33:21,244
I don't like the way it defaults it.

490
00:33:21,244 --> 00:33:22,011
You know what I prefer?

491
00:33:22,011 --> 00:33:28,303
I prefer my box plots for example.

492
00:33:28,303 --> 00:33:29,456
Yeah, I like that.

493
00:33:29,456 --> 00:33:32,902
Better helps me think left.

494
00:33:32,902 --> 00:33:34,354
Right. Small values, big values.

495
00:33:34,354 --> 00:33:36,258
What would you say?

496
00:33:36,258 --> 00:33:41,569
The distribution of this is which direction?

497
00:33:41,569 --> 00:33:42,529
Let's see.

498
00:33:42,529 --> 00:33:45,180
Right, slightly less speed.

499
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:45,694
Right. I mean,

500
00:33:45,694 --> 00:33:49,691
what you're getting is this longer tail right here, longer than this?

501
00:33:49,691 --> 00:33:53,034
Okay. So yeah, let's do you also see that.

502
00:33:53,034 --> 00:33:54,649
Right? The median, you know,

503
00:33:54,649 --> 00:33:57,161
has a longer distance to out here to Q.

504
00:33:57,161 --> 00:33:58,308
One than this.

505
00:33:58,308 --> 00:33:59,601
Q two to Q three.

506
00:33:59,601 --> 00:34:00,482
Medium to Q. Three.

507
00:34:00,482 --> 00:34:03,128
That's left skew.

508
00:34:03,128 --> 00:34:08,051
What if we go back to and create a hissed a gram or a box?

509
00:34:08,051 --> 00:34:13,685
Excuse me for not log age or regular age.

510
00:34:13,685 --> 00:34:14,887
So how do I do that?

511
00:34:14,887 --> 00:34:17,271
Well, same code. All I gotta do is get rid of that

512
00:34:17,271 --> 00:34:17,991
log part.

513
00:34:17,991 --> 00:34:24,618
Right? That's the variable

514
00:34:24,618 --> 00:34:28,193
an answer.

515
00:34:28,193 --> 00:34:31,238
And now this was my original age.

516
00:34:31,238 --> 00:34:36,644
We think that distribution is

517
00:34:36,644 --> 00:34:43,353
I would almost call this symmetric.

518
00:34:43,353 --> 00:34:46,644
Your standards for symmetry are very high, very high.

519
00:34:46,644 --> 00:34:48,426
I would call this symmetric.

520
00:34:48,426 --> 00:34:49,897
If anything it's light.

521
00:34:49,897 --> 00:34:51,761
Right. Skew? So what did this thing do?

522
00:34:51,761 --> 00:34:53,191
Right. What did the log function do?

523
00:34:53,191 --> 00:34:55,524
Right. It took a little bit easier to do this.

524
00:34:55,524 --> 00:34:57,200
It took this variable.

525
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,732
This was the original age variable, right.

526
00:35:00,732 --> 00:35:04,000
Which was pretty nicely behaved, right?

527
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,244
And it took it and it pulled it off.

528
00:35:07,244 --> 00:35:10,790
Right? So it it created skew in it, right.

529
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:12,540
It took a variable that was pre symmetric.

530
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:13,317
And then skewed it.

531
00:35:13,317 --> 00:35:18,454
You know, if you want, we can we can even do

532
00:35:18,454 --> 00:35:23,884
if it makes it a little bit easier show you this.

533
00:35:23,884 --> 00:35:28,049
There's the instagram for age actually look at that when you look at that.

534
00:35:28,049 --> 00:35:29,491
This is kind of misleading, almost.

535
00:35:29,491 --> 00:35:31,885
Right. For our We were thinking symmetric.

536
00:35:31,885 --> 00:35:34,653
This thing is actually a little flat to some degree.

537
00:35:34,653 --> 00:35:36,580
Right.

538
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:43,808
And then what if I do the history Graham for made a dollar sign log ege.

539
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:46,002
That thing's definitely left ski right.

540
00:35:46,002 --> 00:35:50,966
So we took a variable that was pretty flat and we put skew on it.

541
00:35:50,966 --> 00:35:55,608
So that was the effect of doing a log transformation.

542
00:35:55,608 --> 00:35:58,317
So this is kind of a weird example, to be honest with you.

543
00:35:58,317 --> 00:36:00,940
Right. I created this because I wanted you to see

544
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:05,796
that you could make a function of a variable that's already in your data set.

545
00:36:05,796 --> 00:36:06,419
Okay.

546
00:36:06,419 --> 00:36:09,541
Do something like a log transformation.

547
00:36:09,541 --> 00:36:13,547
Normally what you'll use a log transformation for is the reverse of this.

548
00:36:13,547 --> 00:36:18,241
If you've got something that's highly skewed, you'll take a log transformation

549
00:36:18,241 --> 00:36:21,621
and it'll it'll make it a little more unimodal symmetric.

550
00:36:21,621 --> 00:36:26,604
Okay, so, you know, I'm just trying to show you how you can if

551
00:36:26,604 --> 00:36:30,667
you need to fix fix the distribution of a variable.

552
00:36:30,667 --> 00:36:32,314
Right? This becomes important when we do linear

553
00:36:32,314 --> 00:36:32,851
regression.

554
00:36:32,851 --> 00:36:34,496
Right. If you've seen linear regression

555
00:36:34,496 --> 00:36:35,321
before, right.

556
00:36:35,321 --> 00:36:37,634
We think about normal distributions for that.

557
00:36:37,634 --> 00:36:40,252
Okay. Here, here, I'm being the reverse of.

558
00:36:40,252 --> 00:36:43,494
It makes sense.

559
00:36:43,494 --> 00:36:45,590
Code makes sense.

560
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:50,075
Are you seeing how we're just recycling the same pieces of code before?

561
00:36:50,075 --> 00:36:54,822
Sometimes we just add a little bit extra on change variable names.

562
00:36:54,822 --> 00:36:56,758
All right.

563
00:36:56,758 --> 00:36:58,013
Question nine.

564
00:36:58,013 --> 00:36:59,583
Look at this. We're flying through this.

565
00:36:59,583 --> 00:37:04,086
Alright, suppose that you are interested in designing a study with

566
00:37:04,086 --> 00:37:06,298
individuals age 65 and above.

567
00:37:06,298 --> 00:37:09,241
How many such samples are in your data set?

568
00:37:09,241 --> 00:37:10,528
So I'm gonna give you a minute to do that.

569
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:12,976
I want you to do try to take a shot at that on your own.

570
00:37:12,976 --> 00:37:15,309
So I'm giving you a hint.

571
00:37:15,309 --> 00:37:17,742
But this is a situation where there are many,

572
00:37:17,742 --> 00:37:20,761
many different ways that you can answer this question.

573
00:37:20,761 --> 00:37:21,975
We get to the same answer.

574
00:37:21,975 --> 00:37:23,056
Right? This is pretty common.

575
00:37:23,056 --> 00:37:25,861
And coding. You've got an objective something you're

576
00:37:25,861 --> 00:37:29,093
trying to do, but there are many different solutions.

577
00:37:29,093 --> 00:37:32,875
So think about how you could identify,

578
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:37,927
remember question is how many aged 65 plus after.

579
00:37:37,927 --> 00:37:43,880
If you want

580
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:50,495
to answer,

581
00:37:50,495 --> 00:37:55,125
give you

582
00:37:55,125 --> 00:37:59,759
a hint.

583
00:37:59,759 --> 00:38:00,801
Right?

584
00:38:00,801 --> 00:38:04,498
That's how we that's how we did it in the lab.

585
00:38:04,498 --> 00:38:09,532
If you if you think of something

586
00:38:09,532 --> 00:38:16,509
a little bit slicker, that's great too.

587
00:38:16,509 --> 00:38:22,032
And an equal

588
00:38:22,032 --> 00:38:29,211
to 65 greater

589
00:38:29,211 --> 00:38:34,182
than equal

590
00:38:34,182 --> 00:38:38,599
to Okay,

591
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:43,569
wait till I

592
00:38:43,569 --> 00:38:49,092
see you have

593
00:38:49,092 --> 00:38:55,177
a question.

594
00:38:55,177 --> 00:38:55,805
No.

595
00:38:55,805 --> 00:38:58,635
Okay, I'll just wait, wait till I see some some eyes looking up.

596
00:38:58,635 --> 00:38:59,135
You're working.

597
00:38:59,135 --> 00:39:09,135
That's

598
00:39:16,911 --> 00:39:26,911
good.

599
00:39:31,868 --> 00:39:34,986
How many people are following along with how we did in the tutorial?

600
00:39:34,986 --> 00:39:38,246
Created a new variable in the Canada Okay, that's good.

601
00:39:38,246 --> 00:39:41,740
Anybody come up with a different way.

602
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:46,330
A little bit of a little bit, a little bit of experience, but

603
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:48,133
do that way in a second.

604
00:39:48,133 --> 00:39:51,514
What if I can just do something as easy as So what do you think?

605
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:57,669
Some does that's what summary does add them up.

606
00:39:57,669 --> 00:39:58,312
Right? It's a sum.

607
00:39:58,312 --> 00:40:04,060
Right? So if I pass this thing I can

608
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:10,443
say hey go down the column of age.

609
00:40:10,443 --> 00:40:12,065
Okay.

610
00:40:12,065 --> 00:40:15,983
See which ones are bigger than 65 bigger than or equal to 65.

611
00:40:15,983 --> 00:40:20,805
Okay that will return a one if you're bigger than or equal to 65 or turn zero.

612
00:40:20,805 --> 00:40:24,039
Otherwise I had an answer for

613
00:40:24,039 --> 00:40:30,384
that I get an answer of 300 meat for my data set right?

614
00:40:30,384 --> 00:40:31,994
For E. H. S.

615
00:40:31,994 --> 00:40:36,316
So in one line that quickly I can get an answer to that question.

616
00:40:36,316 --> 00:40:41,350
Alternatively I can do the other way E.

617
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:42,462
T.

618
00:40:42,462 --> 00:40:44,139
There you go.

619
00:40:44,139 --> 00:40:49,236
And I could call this Age 65

620
00:40:49,236 --> 00:40:54,817
is equal to that else function.

621
00:40:54,817 --> 00:40:59,155
If age greater than or equal to 65.

622
00:40:59,155 --> 00:41:05,102
If you are making a one if you're not making it zero.

623
00:41:05,102 --> 00:41:06,370
Well I made a mistake.

624
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:07,861
Where's my mistake?

625
00:41:07,861 --> 00:41:09,540
If that's very good.

626
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:14,593
So the first thing you gotta do when you see red like this assume it's your fault.

627
00:41:14,593 --> 00:41:15,564
You made a silly mistake.

628
00:41:15,564 --> 00:41:19,428
That's what I did right I didn't do that on purpose I just forgot.

629
00:41:19,428 --> 00:41:23,123
Okay So I made that variable and then how can I summarize that variable?

630
00:41:23,123 --> 00:41:26,421
How can I get information out of that age 60 five.

631
00:41:26,421 --> 00:41:34,683
Table right I can do table Data dollar sign age 65.

632
00:41:34,683 --> 00:41:36,232
There's 380 that's the same.

633
00:41:36,232 --> 00:41:38,119
380 I got right there.

634
00:41:38,119 --> 00:41:43,088
Okay so moral of the story for this one is that I've given

635
00:41:43,088 --> 00:41:48,163
you some some ways of being able to manipulate your data,

636
00:41:48,163 --> 00:41:53,979
do basic things as you become more experienced with our you know,

637
00:41:53,979 --> 00:41:58,447
you'll learn how to do things like this, right?

638
00:41:58,447 --> 00:42:01,639
Sometimes it's just a matter of seeing somebody else doing it and

639
00:42:01,639 --> 00:42:03,914
being like I didn't know you could do that.

640
00:42:03,914 --> 00:42:06,017
I want to throw that away now if I need to do it again.

641
00:42:06,017 --> 00:42:07,982
Right? Makes it a little bit easier.

642
00:42:07,982 --> 00:42:10,618
No, nothing wrong with doing it this way.

643
00:42:10,618 --> 00:42:11,225
Right? The long,

644
00:42:11,225 --> 00:42:14,550
you know the longer way you know, you save yourself a little bit,

645
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:18,359
a little bit of code when you have when you have like a big programs, you know

646
00:42:18,359 --> 00:42:22,403
sometimes it can make a big difference and things are easier to understand.

647
00:42:22,403 --> 00:42:26,405
But yeah, I think I think either of these these solutions were fun and

648
00:42:26,405 --> 00:42:30,278
of course the most important part is to get back to the same answer.

649
00:42:30,278 --> 00:42:35,038
Either way,

650
00:42:35,038 --> 00:42:38,937
correct.

651
00:42:38,937 --> 00:42:40,046
Yeah right that's right there.

652
00:42:40,046 --> 00:42:44,241
You know, you could totally take this.

653
00:42:44,241 --> 00:42:46,943
You know, you could do, we should do this real quick.

654
00:42:46,943 --> 00:42:51,036
I should show you right? So if I want the number of people that

655
00:42:51,036 --> 00:42:54,948
are greater than 65 it's 3 53.

656
00:42:54,948 --> 00:42:59,205
Alright, so that's greater then if you're doing

657
00:42:59,205 --> 00:43:03,870
equality in programming it's always two equal signs.

658
00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:07,950
Okay a single equal sign means an assignment.

659
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:10,057
Right? So like like right here data equals

660
00:43:10,057 --> 00:43:12,531
when you do something like this encoding,

661
00:43:12,531 --> 00:43:16,530
it's saying okay whatever you do on the right side, I'm saving it.

662
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:17,980
Is this thing on the left side.

663
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:20,543
If you want to check to see if two things are equal,

664
00:43:20,543 --> 00:43:22,325
it's always a double equal sign.

665
00:43:22,325 --> 00:43:22,892
Okay?

666
00:43:22,892 --> 00:43:25,376
So actually watch if I get rid of this,

667
00:43:25,376 --> 00:43:28,649
this is gonna this is gonna give an error, right?

668
00:43:28,649 --> 00:43:29,990
It's gonna be like what do you mean?

669
00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:30,756
This doesn't make sense.

670
00:43:30,756 --> 00:43:35,246
I can't set inequality in here, right?

671
00:43:35,246 --> 00:43:42,349
I get a double equal dot com.

672
00:43:42,349 --> 00:43:46,694
Any other questions makes sense.

673
00:43:46,694 --> 00:43:52,129
You feel like you feel like you're making Progress, can you make a new variable?

674
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:56,586
And just have the people that are greater than you lose 65 and not make it finally.

675
00:43:56,586 --> 00:43:58,225
Okay so that be something different.

676
00:43:58,225 --> 00:43:59,196
Let's let's take a minute to do this.

677
00:43:59,196 --> 00:44:03,883
So what you could do is this so there there are here's a function

678
00:44:03,883 --> 00:44:07,784
called filter that comes in the tidyverse package.

679
00:44:07,784 --> 00:44:08,522
Okay. And

680
00:44:08,522 --> 00:44:12,301
what it does is it'll take your full data set.

681
00:44:12,301 --> 00:44:16,320
So mine has 1993.

682
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,110
Right? And

683
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:22,372
I can say you know what I just want to look at people over age 65 or

684
00:44:22,372 --> 00:44:26,771
65 or over Whatever we're gonna call it over 65.

685
00:44:26,771 --> 00:44:27,802
Okay?

686
00:44:27,802 --> 00:44:29,584
And I can say filter.

687
00:44:29,584 --> 00:44:32,809
Well I want to go to that data set and

688
00:44:32,809 --> 00:44:37,943
I want to take people age Greater than or equal to 65.

689
00:44:37,943 --> 00:44:44,469
Actually, before I say it, let me just show you what it does.

690
00:44:46,068 --> 00:44:49,486
So remember if I don't if I don't say that if I don't put anything to the left with

691
00:44:49,486 --> 00:44:51,950
an equal sign, I'm just running it at the command line and

692
00:44:51,950 --> 00:44:54,393
it's doing the command if I want to capture that.

693
00:44:54,393 --> 00:44:58,132
you know, I have to have to make it equal to something but look what this is doing

694
00:44:58,132 --> 00:45:01,035
is I said hey, just go through this data set filter, right?

695
00:45:01,035 --> 00:45:01,963
We think filtered up.

696
00:45:01,963 --> 00:45:04,733
It's you know, it's putting things, you know, one side or the other.

697
00:45:04,733 --> 00:45:06,895
Right? It's saying just keep for

698
00:45:06,895 --> 00:45:09,537
me people over age 6500 and 65.

699
00:45:09,537 --> 00:45:13,197
Alright, so look at the age very well, All these people are over age 65.

700
00:45:13,197 --> 00:45:15,343
Right? How many of them are there?

701
00:45:15,343 --> 00:45:16,964
380?

702
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:19,158
Because that was the question.

703
00:45:19,158 --> 00:45:20,318
The nice thing about this,

704
00:45:20,318 --> 00:45:23,251
this format is it gives you this like nice little summary right here.

705
00:45:23,251 --> 00:45:24,694
Right? So I could have just done this and

706
00:45:24,694 --> 00:45:26,733
I still could have gotten to that three eighties.

707
00:45:26,733 --> 00:45:31,268
That's another way I could have gotten to 3 80 if I want to make this a different

708
00:45:31,268 --> 00:45:34,352
dataset because maybe I want to do an analysis on this.

709
00:45:34,352 --> 00:45:40,704
I can just say this, I can say maybe I call this data _ 65.

710
00:45:40,704 --> 00:45:44,969
I kind of like these these these naming conventions because it's it helps me

711
00:45:44,969 --> 00:45:46,503
remember that, you know,

712
00:45:46,503 --> 00:45:49,649
this was originally from this thing called data right?

713
00:45:49,649 --> 00:45:51,407
Like like full data set.

714
00:45:51,407 --> 00:45:56,181
And you know, the criteria is people you know greater than or equal to 65.

715
00:45:56,181 --> 00:46:01,641
So if I could enter on this right up there in your top right corner.

716
00:46:01,641 --> 00:46:03,622
Okay, you have data 65 Pop up.

717
00:46:03,622 --> 00:46:07,399
That's a whole new data set again, 380 observations.

718
00:46:07,399 --> 00:46:12,106
If I click on it, it's got all the same stuff that was in there.

719
00:46:12,106 --> 00:46:15,164
Okay, I'll show you one more real quick.

720
00:46:15,164 --> 00:46:17,010
I know I know we're over.

721
00:46:17,010 --> 00:46:23,622
Another thing about the plier Tidyverse has these these pipe commands.

722
00:46:23,622 --> 00:46:25,613
Okay so it looks like this.

723
00:46:25,613 --> 00:46:30,742
It's a it's an ampersand not an ampersand a percent sign.

724
00:46:30,742 --> 00:46:35,512
Right facing carrot I guess.

725
00:46:35,512 --> 00:46:37,164
And then another percent sign.

726
00:46:37,164 --> 00:46:38,709
So this thing is called a pipe.

727
00:46:38,709 --> 00:46:42,185
And what it does is it says run this command and

728
00:46:42,185 --> 00:46:46,773
then send whatever you got from there to the next function.

729
00:46:46,773 --> 00:46:52,640
Okay So we already know what happens when I run this command makes this thing.

730
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:56,645
Now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna use a function called select.

731
00:46:56,645 --> 00:47:02,783
Okay If filter only keeps certain roads select only keep certain columns.

732
00:47:02,783 --> 00:47:04,567
Right? So maybe I don't want all the columns.

733
00:47:04,567 --> 00:47:07,688
So maybe what I want is S.

734
00:47:07,688 --> 00:47:08,201
D. Q.

735
00:47:08,201 --> 00:47:08,924
N.

736
00:47:08,924 --> 00:47:10,452
Right? The number and

737
00:47:10,452 --> 00:47:15,964
well I know everybody's over 65 so I don't need that one anymore.

738
00:47:15,964 --> 00:47:21,082
Maybe what I want is this this gender variable which

739
00:47:21,082 --> 00:47:26,212
I think is probably better called biological sex.

740
00:47:26,212 --> 00:47:27,384
And you're wanting to change it to death.

741
00:47:27,384 --> 00:47:29,339
That's what I would do and say I want B.

742
00:47:29,339 --> 00:47:35,276
M. I maybe I would name

743
00:47:35,276 --> 00:47:40,021
it this right.

744
00:47:40,021 --> 00:47:43,328
I'd say okay What is in this data set?

745
00:47:43,328 --> 00:47:46,051
Okay this is started with the original data.

746
00:47:46,051 --> 00:47:53,326
People over age 65 and I'm just keeping the sex and be my variables.

747
00:47:53,326 --> 00:47:57,125
So if I had to enter on this this will create a new data set up here.

748
00:47:57,125 --> 00:47:59,556
You can see it right here.

749
00:47:59,556 --> 00:48:02,520
I don't think it's gonna let me pull over but

750
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:07,908
now instead of having all the columns, I've only picked off the ones that I want.

751
00:48:07,908 --> 00:48:16,073
Okay.

752
00:48:16,073 --> 00:48:16,815
Makes sense.

753
00:48:16,815 --> 00:48:20,906
Is that you get that to work for you?

754
00:48:20,906 --> 00:48:24,510
So again, these are these are you know what I just did here was

755
00:48:24,510 --> 00:48:27,781
two functions that we haven't haven't quite used yet.

756
00:48:27,781 --> 00:48:29,110
But a filter, right?

757
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:34,346
Is removing just keeping things that satisfy this certain condition right here.

758
00:48:34,346 --> 00:48:39,673
You know, if you want just men or just women, you can use filter you want,

759
00:48:39,673 --> 00:48:44,834
you know just one race group if you want just one of these diet categories,

760
00:48:44,834 --> 00:48:46,602
okay you can use filter.

761
00:48:46,602 --> 00:48:49,986
You know if you want to cut down the number of variables,

762
00:48:49,986 --> 00:48:52,226
you know you would use the select ok.

763
00:48:52,226 --> 00:48:54,282
And then this pipe is saying,

764
00:48:54,282 --> 00:48:59,302
you know what it did is it first created this data set which was just people

765
00:48:59,302 --> 00:49:05,172
over age 65 then passed it to the select function which what it selected, it said.

766
00:49:05,172 --> 00:49:07,377
Well just just keep for me the I.

767
00:49:07,377 --> 00:49:08,075
D.

768
00:49:08,075 --> 00:49:08,755
The gender B.

769
00:49:08,755 --> 00:49:09,947
M. I. Variable.

770
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:16,818
So it created that You know these things are pretty powerful because

771
00:49:16,818 --> 00:49:22,180
it saves you having to do repetitive pieces of coding.

772
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:25,578
Yeah coders are, you know they're kind of lazy and

773
00:49:25,578 --> 00:49:30,333
come up with these creative ways to called one liners offense, right?

774
00:49:30,333 --> 00:49:32,710
How can you do something in one line of code?

775
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:38,101
Right, just like how before, when it was counts up, the number of people

776
00:49:38,101 --> 00:49:43,069
over age 65, you know, this is like a one liner could do it in one line

777
00:49:43,069 --> 00:49:48,573
instead of having to break it out across multiple lines like we did over here.

778
00:49:48,573 --> 00:49:51,785
Alright, so I'm gonna stop recording now,

779
00:49:51,785 --> 00:49:57,614
Hopefully this should get you well on your way to completing the lab the tutorial,

780
00:49:57,614 --> 00:50:03,189
and at this point you should be set to get started on working on lab module one and

781
00:50:03,189 --> 00:50:05,916
next week in your lab you will have a G.

782
00:50:05,916 --> 00:50:06,604
S. I.

783
00:50:06,604 --> 00:50:08,804
Give you a quick overview of, you know,

784
00:50:08,804 --> 00:50:11,910
the big idea sort of sell you like how you can get started,

785
00:50:11,910 --> 00:50:16,442
we'll also show you my sample lab report, which you should have looked at okay, or

786
00:50:16,442 --> 00:50:20,714
to look at it before next week, and we'll sort of really pinpoint, you know,

787
00:50:20,714 --> 00:50:25,249
here's the pieces where you know, you're doing this and here's the pieces where

788
00:50:25,249 --> 00:50:29,090
