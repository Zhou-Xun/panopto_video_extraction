1
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:04,980
That's right. So the blockers I'm sorry.

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:10,380
It just became like a whole new ballgame. All right, let's get started.

3
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:15,690
It's fun. So much for America want to do today and submit it.

4
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:26,040
Make sure it's committed by IPR. Otherwise, it's going to be counted as late submission as the homework one deal today and homework to sign up today.

5
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,670
And it's still next Thursday. And we're going to have to start.

6
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:36,830
We play homework. Right.

7
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:43,950
And also a good news for Friday recitation section we all read and most of the times we do 3330.

8
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,169
So I hope all of you have 1/2 now.

9
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,490
Well, I will make an announcement later all about the content.

10
00:00:53,370 --> 00:01:02,160
The room is going to be the same. And so now the time is to 3 to 3 3932.

11
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,100
Yeah. Yeah.

12
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:16,020
So I have asked to come and I see you that the problem that I would kind of go over tomorrow is going to be a very interesting and challenging one.

13
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:21,840
So any questions?

14
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:39,540
All right. So last time we talked about we have talked about the probability axioms and all the basic definitions.

15
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:45,000
And today we're going to move on and talk about this in all probability, independence.

16
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:51,240
So first statement definitions that say what is conditional probability.

17
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:55,260
So the definition of conditional probability is defined as follows.

18
00:01:55,650 --> 00:02:04,410
Suppose there are two events A and B, so we write a conditional probability of A given B in this form.

19
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:17,450
In this racial murder. The numerator is the probability of A and B.

20
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:25,430
We use this ab notation to denote a intersection with B.

21
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:33,740
The intersection between a, b and the denominator is just the probability of the given or a assuming.

22
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:42,350
The probability of B is not equal to zero. So this is how we define a so-called conditional probability.

23
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:53,840
If the conditional probability of events A given that B has occurred from a notation, it's just a vertical bar, B, whatever.

24
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,790
In the second place, it's the condition which assume something that has happened.

25
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:03,700
And the first part is that the event that we want to calculate the probability on.

26
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:09,170
So if can look at the numerator, it's the probability of this intersection of two events.

27
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,430
What does that imply? It's a new event, right?

28
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:20,390
It means both happen and the denominator is just the probability of event B happen.

29
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:24,710
And that's essentially how we define this, that a conditional probability.

30
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:31,220
Similarly, you can also define the conditional probability of event P gave an A in the same form,

31
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:36,740
in the same fashion, where it does reach the role of the MP in the bottom.

32
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:44,270
Again, if you want this definition to make sense, you need to assume the probability of a is not equal zero.

33
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:53,990
Mathematically, that's pretty obvious why we need to assume that conceptually we also want to know why we need to make that assumption right.

34
00:03:55,430 --> 00:04:01,040
And the reason for that assumption is really because you condition out that information on that event.

35
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:11,330
If that event does not occur, if that event has zero probable probability, then does it really make sense to conditional something that never happens?

36
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:15,530
Well, that's why we need to have this additional assumption.

37
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:22,669
You want to define conditional probability. When we talk about conditional probability,

38
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:31,700
it's always conditional upon something has happened so that something has to have some probability of happening.

39
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:39,560
Otherwise it doesn't make sense. That's why we need these additional assumptions on how to properly define conditional probability and.

40
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:54,790
So let's first look at an example and look at an example on the on the task boat and say

41
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:59,890
how this conditional probability can be used in practice to help us solve some problems.

42
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:07,660
Example 1.3.1 concerns about selecting cards from that.

43
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:14,080
So essentially the setup is a question is what is the probability of selecting?

44
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:25,370
Four aces from this 52 cards.

45
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:31,830
So previously we have looked at this probability calculation from a column perspective.

46
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:43,160
So recall that if you just randomly draw cars full of cards from the deck without replacement, what is the probability of selecting 40?

47
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:51,630
Also, I think Boris is is just the one arrangement or one particular draw.

48
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:56,430
Right. And in total, there are three, three to choose,

49
00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:07,049
four different ways to draw the cards from the that without replacement and without considering the the order says each of the each arrangement,

50
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:15,240
each draw has equal probability. So you can calculate this probability to be one over 50 to 2 is four.

51
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:20,130
So that's using the counting procedure that we learned before.

52
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:27,270
Right now we can also think about this problem from a conditional probability perspective.

53
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:36,690
Is that all thinking about drawing all cards at the same time because they do the procedure in a sequential way,

54
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:42,360
you draw first card first and then you draw the second card and then the third car and then the fourth car.

55
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:53,280
So then the question becomes, are the event can be equivalently represented as the probability of a say.

56
00:06:54,510 --> 00:07:06,440
So that one is. In the first four times the probability.

57
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:19,220
Given that you already select eight in the first draw, what is the probability of selecting a second is the second.

58
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:25,650
Hey. Hi. Given that I have.

59
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,129
All right, so I need to assess what is the probability of selecting.

60
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:33,000
The third is the third goal. And time is the last one.

61
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:39,830
Given that I already selected races in the first three draws, what's the probability of selecting the fourth race in the last rule?

62
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:49,490
Right. That's why you can break down this selecting for cards for aces problem into this for stats.

63
00:07:50,810 --> 00:08:01,550
And now if I look at each probability, we can say that each of them should be pretty straightforward to calculate conceptually.

64
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:05,060
For example, selecting one is from the deck.

65
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:12,550
What is the probability of that? Yes.

66
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:18,500
One of 13, 2013 or 14 because there are four.

67
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:26,200
Is this all? There is a need and one of them. So you have four different choices and in total you have 52 choices or over.

68
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:38,570
And what about the second one, given that they already selected one in the first of all, what is the probability now that another race and a second.

69
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:43,100
Yes. Over safety one are good three or 51.

70
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:48,920
Right. But given something has already happened, that means that thing already happened.

71
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:57,110
So whatever event that we care about it, we only consider with them that subspace of the sample space.

72
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:01,840
Are these conditions has already been satisfied.

73
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:12,100
So so I think the second is in the second draw, given that first of all, we already set a is going to be three over 21.

74
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:23,140
Similarly, you can calculate the third conditional probability to be two over 50 and last one to be one over 40.

75
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:28,880
If you multiply these numbers, you got exactly the same result.

76
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:35,900
Now I'll say this is actually a very famous theorem in conditional, probably probability.

77
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:42,800
It's called the the multiplication multiplication rule.

78
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:53,420
And so I'll see that in a second. But this is just provide us an alternative way of solving the same problem, using this conditional probability idea.

79
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:54,860
In practice,

80
00:09:54,860 --> 00:10:07,090
there are many questions that are actually easier to solve if we use this conditional probability idea and directly so in another example,

81
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:11,780
similarly similar similar setup which says.

82
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,600
Even we have already selected ices in the first hydros.

83
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:02,880
What is the probability of selecting for the first dance?

84
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:09,000
This I can be one or two or three and I is just a fixed number.

85
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:17,070
So I stating the problem like this is exactly the conditional probability problem, right?

86
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:24,480
Once you say this word a given, it indicate that this is a conditional probability, even a particular event.

87
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:30,840
What is the probability of another event? That's exactly the setup for a conditional probability problem.

88
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:41,640
So then what do we need to do is to clearly define what is the event that is in the condition and what is the event that we are interested in?

89
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,710
Okay. So in this case,

90
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:59,220
I is is has been selecting a in the first I draws as denoted by a say event eight and selecting four aces in four draws as denoted by event B.

91
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:04,710
So what is the conditional probability that we are trying to estimate or trying to calculate?

92
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:23,450
Is it P.A. and B are to be given a? She became a Republican and has already said if gave her a what is the probability of b.

93
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:33,230
So this is what we are after. We want to calculate is P gave a high and then we can follow the definition.

94
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:43,490
These is defined as PIB divided by K, right?

95
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:54,469
That's the definition of how we define a conditional probability I'll be given I then the rest in

96
00:12:54,470 --> 00:13:00,120
order to calculate this conditional probability and just to figure out what is the probability of a,

97
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,360
b, how? What is the probability of it?

98
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:09,170
Once you have those two numbers, just plug it in, calculate the ratio, not give you all the conditional probability.

99
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:25,310
All right. So let's take a look. What is this, a maybe the intersection of A and B, conceptually, what does that event mean?

100
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:41,480
He says in the first I draws I is is has been selected and B says for his assessment selecting the first four draws.

101
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:48,110
So what is the intersection of these two events? And why is that?

102
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:54,290
Well, B is what draws.

103
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:03,080
The answer is correct. It's yes, indeed.

104
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:11,390
That's. It is A or B a.

105
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:17,180
Well, I try, but that's not exactly correct.

106
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,560
Yes. Because B is contained.

107
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:31,890
So first first of all, what is a what is the event? Or why is it so important?

108
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:37,500
As the employer draws in the words. Be the intersection of A and B is also B.

109
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:44,070
And why is that? It could be is contained in K very good because B is content.

110
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:49,110
If B happens, we know for sure it must have happened.

111
00:14:50,380 --> 00:15:02,280
But if you draw for a scene, the first four draws, of course, whenever, whatever a number that I look at this I that is smaller than four.

112
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:08,700
We must have always it's in the first title. So B is much more stringent.

113
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:14,250
B is a much smaller subset of the possible outcomes.

114
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:21,390
So B is content in the said operation.

115
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:31,710
So in other words, we say B implies A. So that's why the intersection of B is in fact, just be so.

116
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:36,090
And that just means these conditional probability.

117
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:43,530
Now you can even simplify it as just the ratio between PLB and over PLB.

118
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:49,170
And then the rat is just the source to calculate what is PLB, what is plb?

119
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:54,240
And that we can get it from this a counting process.

120
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:59,220
So anyone tell me what is the. So let's start from that simple one.

121
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:10,250
PLB So previous slide and we already saw that. So the important thing is in corridors, the probability is one one over 52 over four.

122
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:13,840
Right. And what about PLB one?

123
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:23,250
Tell me, what is that? So Arctic ice is in the first hydros.

124
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:33,020
What's the probability of that? Yes.

125
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:37,070
I say that again. To choose.

126
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:40,700
I say to choose I.

127
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:51,920
But we're talking about the probability of that. So that could be our nominee for fortune.

128
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:56,630
I worked with I over 52, which was very good.

129
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:08,330
Right. The denominator is how many ways we can choose IFRS and the numerator is how many ways that I can choose i i esses from the car.

130
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:13,220
So Ford was I over 52 which was that that's the probability of it.

131
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:25,650
And if you take the ratio of the two. I gave us this.

132
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:38,240
Two truths I over four truths I find huge for any of you.

133
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:44,610
Further expand this untruth k notation and really do the calculation.

134
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:55,980
You will find this is eventually equal to. If the two months on choose four or minus are okay.

135
00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:05,159
And that's the final answer to this question a conditional probability of selecting

136
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:10,060
four aces in the first four draws given aces has been selected in the first idea.

137
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:14,740
If this number one over 52 minus nine, which was four minus.

138
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:25,300
From an alternative perspective. But you can also address this problem as, um, especially given this solution,

139
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:29,980
you can think about alternative way of understanding this solution, right?

140
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:41,440
So choosing four out of four gave an AI out of AI it essentially the probability of choosing the remaining four minus sign from the at that.

141
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:51,790
So the base number just gives you the probability of that. So that's just another way to rationalize this result.

142
00:18:53,410 --> 00:19:02,260
Any questions? All right.

143
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:05,990
So the the.

144
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:15,560
There are some properties of this conditional probability.

145
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:21,710
So the first property is the law of compound probability.

146
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:29,270
I don't know why that is in the slides before I talk about these properties.

147
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:35,750
So let's take one step back and think about this conditional probability lamination.

148
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:47,420
And the first think about whether this conditional probability as defined in this way is a properly defined probability function.

149
00:19:48,770 --> 00:20:01,820
In other words, is this this use this key given the current value, whatever event here.

150
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:05,720
Right. This is a function. A function only events.

151
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:25,040
All right. So in this. Before we proceed, we need to first get this straight.

152
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:31,490
We need to make sure that these conditional probability function is actually a property defined a probability function.

153
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:38,839
Right. Your Honor, to talk about the property itself as if it's not even a probability function,

154
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:48,800
then there is no point of using it in the more general context in order to, to, to know whether it's a property defined probability function.

155
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:54,290
Now we have to go back to the the common ground axioms.

156
00:20:54,890 --> 00:21:02,450
We have three axioms that I would need to chart in order to make sure this particular function is a proper probability function.

157
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:08,300
Recall that the first one says the probability of a small space is always equal to one.

158
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:13,280
Second one says the probability function. So always take it down that there value.

159
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:18,500
Third one says we have is that countable, infinite activity.

160
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:29,330
Countable activity. So we need to check them one by one to make sure this function defined in this way is actually a proper probability function.

161
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:39,680
Okay, so first then first the probability of the sample space given B, is that equal to one.

162
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:43,310
So then we have to follow this definition, right?

163
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:54,800
So the probability of the sample space given by the other words, the probability of all the events, all possible outcomes given event B happens.

164
00:21:56,290 --> 00:22:09,370
I must be equal to the probability of being given the right because we are already conventional be has happened.

165
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:13,510
So the sample space is no longer that me. It actually got shrunk.

166
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:22,030
It shrunk to the speed so that if you plug into this definition it is in a very finite

167
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:29,920
that's also so the first step is satisfying and the final one for any event a,

168
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:39,960
g, a given B by definition is to B over tbe right.

169
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:44,060
And we know both the numerator and denominator is greater.

170
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:47,860
Zero is in particular. The denominator is not equal to zero.

171
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:54,340
So this that has to be greater, all equal to zero for any a in the sample space.

172
00:22:54,970 --> 00:23:02,320
Okay. So the second axiom I say also and the third, the carnival, an activity.

173
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:11,650
So that is probably the hardest one to check. Assume that you have a mutually exclusive events sequence A1 to infinity.

174
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:26,260
So the probability of the union of one three infinity by the event we want to show this is equal to this infinite summation.

175
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:43,480
Oh, I gave Andy. If we can somehow show this, then the third axiom also satisfies with these three axioms,

176
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:48,880
we can conclude that this conditional probability is the proper probability function.

177
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:56,410
So now the question is how do we show the third? So maybe I'll give you one minute and you can try it on yourself.

178
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:01,750
Say how you can go from the left hand side to the right hand using what do we have here?

179
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:11,160
And the definition, of course, this is a piece of paper and try to break it down and write about it.

180
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:15,280
See what I can prove. I'm sorry. You can't get it right.

181
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:52,130
All right. How far do you got to finish the proof there?

182
00:25:53,640 --> 00:26:00,680
So let's look at this together. So again, the target is pretty clear and we want to show that one side is equal to the right hand side.

183
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:10,780
In other words, we want to switch the order of the start limit operation and the probability if we can somehow do it, then we complete the proof.

184
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:14,840
Not this conditional probabilities is indeed a probability function.

185
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:18,860
Let's take a look how to get there.

186
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:25,200
So first I'm first we can write down the definition, right?

187
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:37,940
Given B the probability of the unit, even a unit of air by definition is just the probability of the union of I goes from one to infinity.

188
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:47,240
I intersect with B. Divided by the probability that I'll be okay.

189
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:52,379
But that's just applying the definition of the top half of the country now.

190
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:58,670
And notice that the third that we need to take care of is in the numerator we have.

191
00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:04,100
This union in a union intersect with another side by side operation.

192
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:13,490
We know that that is equal to the impact of union of these intersections,

193
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:21,120
easy intersection being the intersection of A and B, that's not just the distribution.

194
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:29,420
The law, which we have learned in the first lecture, and the denominator is the same.

195
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:39,590
And then from there, what can we apply? Always keep in mind we want to switch the order of this limit operation of the probability.

196
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:49,100
All right. So how do we switch it? Yes, we know that is the Intersect B is a subset of the sample space.

197
00:27:49,730 --> 00:28:01,580
Say that again. The original like a sample space so we can move the summation outside because we already know that, like, probability works on us.

198
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:11,030
Very good. So since we already know that this P is a proper probability function, so it satisfy the third axiom, right?

199
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:16,520
If you look at what's inside, there's a union, infinite carnival, a union, a union.

200
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:22,370
These guys this intersect with B, they are mutually exclusive.

201
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:28,580
You can you can show that, right. Because they are mutually exclusive on the intersection of A and B,

202
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:36,140
they are also mutually exclusive by applying a third axiom for the our original probability function we actually got.

203
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:40,310
This is equal to I goes from infinity to probability.

204
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:49,130
Okay I. Intersect was being divided by a probability IP.

205
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,160
Now we say that this is what this is by definition.

206
00:28:55,490 --> 00:29:02,000
The conditional probability of any given.

207
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:07,430
Right. And that essentially gave us what do we need.

208
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:14,569
So really the key is here by first of all, define the definitions and then using the third act,

209
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:19,040
sample the original probability content with that and we complete the proof.

210
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:23,900
Now we know that this conditional probability is indeed a probability function.

211
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:34,730
So we can feel comfortable to use it as a standard probability function because it is indeed what would define a probability function.

212
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:41,159
Any question. Okay.

213
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:45,060
So now let's look at some properties of this conditional probability.

214
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:49,440
So the first property is called the Law of Compound Probability,

215
00:29:50,100 --> 00:30:00,990
and it says the probability of this A intercept with B or the probability of A and B is equal to the probability of A times,

216
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:04,230
the probability of B given or it has.

217
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:12,510
Which daughter is also equal to the probability of he finds the probability of a given right.

218
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:26,460
And one thing that we should note is that we didn't put any additional constraint or additional assumptions in this in this property.

219
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:33,420
In other words, we did not require we do not require APA equal to zero or PB equal to zero.

220
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:36,810
And we'll see why. Why is that in a second? Okay.

221
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:43,350
First of all, let's just assume pay is not equal to zero.

222
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:47,580
P b is not equal to zero. And we say why?

223
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:51,480
And it's pretty clear why that's that's the case.

224
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:55,049
Right. Because, you know, this two is equal to zero.

225
00:30:55,050 --> 00:31:04,720
Then we know by definition P given B is PIB divided by P, right.

226
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:10,860
You just move that denominator from the right hand side to the left hand side and you've got what you wish you want.

227
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:19,920
Okay. Similarly, p be given a is p b over pay.

228
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:23,340
So similarly, you can move the denominator to the left hand side.

229
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:27,270
You got what you want. So that's the easy case. All right.

230
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:33,450
But what if pay is equal to zero?

231
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:43,650
If pay is equal to zero, then p what we know is that he'd be given a.

232
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:57,040
Is now defined. So by definition we cannot define PDK.

233
00:31:57,070 --> 00:32:02,730
But if. So we don't have to worry about the maintenance term.

234
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:06,230
Let's just look at the first term is equal to the third term.

235
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:10,890
Okay. So if PIA is zero, what is PIB?

236
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:30,470
If A has if even A has probability zero, what is the probability of A and B is zero because A and B implies A, A, and B also implies B, right.

237
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:33,980
And B is a subset of A in A has probability zero.

238
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:38,090
Of course, AB you're going to have probability zero.

239
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:41,990
So B's the first time has probability zero.

240
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:48,090
What about the. Second time this TV.

241
00:32:48,880 --> 00:33:03,000
I'm a gamer. A given b if p b is now zero, let's just be a little more rigorous.

242
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:10,470
P P is zero, p b is now zero, then p b times pi given.

243
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:16,920
B can be expressed as PIB divided by CV.

244
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:23,190
Which is also P, which is also a zero.

245
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:34,200
So that just says if zero TV is not a zero, then we still have to be equal to TV times per a given.

246
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:56,500
Similarly, you can show that if P a is now zero, the B is zero, then PIB going to be equal to be a times p even which is equal to zero.

247
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:05,770
And finally, if both PM VB are equal to zero, then none of the second or third term makes sense out there now.

248
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:12,610
So there is no way of knowing the point of proving the decline.

249
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:19,989
So this actually tells us that there are different ways of defining conditional

250
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:25,210
probability and there are different ways of expressing this conditional probability.

251
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:30,280
So later on, we are use that when we define independence.

252
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:37,630
So for now, all we need to know is that you can have neither of these two are zero.

253
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:43,720
Then you have this equality with three different ways to express the probability of A and B.

254
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:48,160
So this is called the law of compound probability.

255
00:34:53,900 --> 00:35:00,980
It's up to the privacy rights to like not the undefined is not the same as zero.

256
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:05,600
Undefined is not the same as how come we're saying issue.

257
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:10,969
So we see this is equal only once.

258
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:14,500
Define okay.

259
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:18,770
So what is undefined? Just throw it away. It doesn't make sense.

260
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:30,169
For example, if he be given a it doesn't is not defined, then there's no point of saying what what is equal to BP in any way.

261
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:33,660
So. But the other equality story. Right.

262
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:42,770
Is equal to the times. Give a B. So then would you need to put like the condition on the on the law?

263
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:46,010
Yeah. If you want to write it in the super rigorous way,

264
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:54,500
you would break it down to this different scenarios and divide the equality specifically into each condition.

265
00:35:56,010 --> 00:36:05,860
This is just to give you a general idea of the law of come down probably other questions.

266
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:18,410
All right. So this rule can be further extended to multiple events in particular, if you have a sequence of events,

267
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:26,780
eight one, two eight and then you can express the probability of the intersection of these events,

268
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:36,950
A1 and A2 and eight, three and A4 and all the way to a, n a can be expressed as the product of these probabilities.

269
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:43,710
And so part of the. Probability of a one.

270
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:52,760
And the probability of a two day they want. The probability of a three given a one and a two and so on, so forth.

271
00:36:53,390 --> 00:37:03,610
And the last one is a conditional probability of an gave an eight one, two, eight and eight and minus one six.

272
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:10,430
And this proof follows exactly directly from the previous.

273
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:15,610
Result for two events in particular,

274
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:27,010
we can say that a product of these two right you can directly apply in the previous result not going to be the probability of 1a2.

275
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:40,509
And then you can combine this one and this one to be a probability of a one into a three and so on.

276
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:45,730
So of course in the end you would have got the right hand side is equal to the left side.

277
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:53,570
So this is this multiplication rule is exactly what I would use in this up, for example.

278
00:37:54,020 --> 00:38:01,790
Right. If we want to calculate the probability of getting for aces on a for draws, we can break it down into this different events.

279
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:10,340
First event being the first draw as a second event being the second draw is a third.

280
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:18,800
Fourth are defined in the similarly. So essentially life outside is going to be the probability of first draw being the first ace,

281
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:25,760
first of all being a and second draw being a third draw being a fourth or being an eighth.

282
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:33,470
And the right hand side that tells us this is equal to the probability of the first of all, the eight times the probability,

283
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:40,670
conditional probability of given first draw is a what's the probability of the second draw is also excellent.

284
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:45,530
So it was not exactly applying this the multiplication.

285
00:38:51,330 --> 00:39:04,090
Questions. Another very useful rule or theorem for the conditional probability is this total probability.

286
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:11,200
Besides, we have a sequence of events that are mutually exclusive.

287
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:18,710
Then the union becomes the sum of the other words.

288
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:23,770
By definition, this this A1 two, and they form a quotation of the symbols.

289
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:34,270
That's how we define a quotation. Then for any event P in this small space we can always write the probability to be equal to this summation.

290
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:39,610
The summation of probability is given a probability of be given.

291
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:51,040
So the proof is maybe just one line says you can't apply this compound theorem for each element.

292
00:39:51,550 --> 00:40:02,870
It's not going to give you the probability of B and AEI and says they are a potential of the space of the simple space by.

293
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,860
They must be mutually exclusive. Right.

294
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:15,070
So then you can switch the order of this summation and the probability to eventually get this is equal to the probability of the union.

295
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:19,260
Ion goes from one to and one to the.

296
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:27,760
Yeah. And that is just the probability of b intersect with the union.

297
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:39,760
In a second was the junior high, which is a small space.

298
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:44,170
So it's not just equal to the probability of being. So the crew is not part.

299
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:54,550
But what I want to show you is that the the graphical representation of this result, which is quite intuitive, assuming that you have a sample space.

300
00:40:54,850 --> 00:41:08,320
Right. So this A1 to air essentially defines application of this simple space scenario to be this is a one, two, three.

301
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:13,720
A for example, this is our attention of the sample space.

302
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:28,520
So for any event, B, which essentially is another set in this sample space in order to calculate the

303
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:33,320
probability of B or any other words covering the area of B in the sample space,

304
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:43,610
one way is to directly calculate it. I'll turn it that way as to add up this individual pieces right in each part of this partition.

305
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:51,969
If you add up this for different parts, then you've also got the area of B, an East Party.

306
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:58,180
If you think about it, each part is essentially a conditional probability.

307
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:06,010
A conditional probability. I'll be given a once you've given something that's going to become your new sample space.

308
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:15,190
So these area that I just highlighted is exactly the conditional probability I'll be given a one.

309
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:21,010
Similarly, for all the other parts, it's the conditional probably I'll be given the other events.

310
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:27,190
So as long as you can partition the original sample space into this multiple cards,

311
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:33,010
you can recalculated your probability of B using this conditional probability.

312
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:38,260
And don't forget to multiply the probability of each partition.

313
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:50,470
So. Okay. Because of the conditional probabilities that I gave you, the proportion of this area in this partition.

314
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:58,740
So in order to go to our regional area, in our regional scale, you can multiply the probability of here.

315
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:04,710
Okay. So that give you the idea of why this total probability actually makes sense.

316
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:17,100
Questions. All right.

317
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:27,360
Now, we can use this theorem to actually help us address the question of we have talked about in the first clause.

318
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:32,040
So this Monty Hall problem, assume you are a contestant in the game show.

319
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:34,980
There are three doors behind one of the doors. There is a car.

320
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:43,110
So you take one of the doors and then the host show you what one of the other two doors that has no car in it.

321
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:50,310
So now the question is whether you should switch or you should stay with their original choice.

322
00:43:51,270 --> 00:43:54,720
And if you switch, what is the probability always if you stay?

323
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:59,000
What's the probability of winning? So this is a setup.

324
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:06,800
And previously we have talked about this example and some of you know the answer, which is you definitely should switch.

325
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:10,720
And then once you switch, you actually got a higher chance of winning the car.

326
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:21,170
And now let's take a closer look at this problem and say what is the actual probability of winning if you stay versus if you switch?

327
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:27,470
Right. And to do that, let's use this total probability theorem.

328
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:35,690
So let's define the event of interest to be B, which is.

329
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:44,690
When the car. That's the event that we have.

330
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:45,320
Right.

331
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:58,640
So we want to calculate what's the probability of B, but instead of directly calculating it, that's first plantation, our sample space into two parts.

332
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:32,010
One is that you? So that's because there are two events he wanted to do once you've got the car in the first place.

333
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:35,980
And ATO says he did not give the car your first payment.

334
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:44,080
Conceptually that forms the A1, A2, they are a complement to one another, right.

335
00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:55,090
So they are mutually exclusive. And if you take the union, it's going to be the sample splits because there are only two possible outcomes.

336
00:45:55,090 --> 00:46:07,390
You either got the car doing the common car in the first, but so anyway, to become segmentation of the sample space, now how do we use this partition?

337
00:46:07,930 --> 00:46:16,870
So help us calculate. The probability I'll be in two scenarios.

338
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:21,550
One, you stay. And two, you switch.

339
00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:34,140
So let's have a little discussion so we can discuss with your neighbors.

340
00:46:34,890 --> 00:46:43,020
So let's discuss it for 2 minutes and say, how do we use based on this definition of events?

341
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:47,700
How do we calculate the probability of B in different scenarios?

342
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:55,380
One scenario is you state. Another scenario is you switch using What do we just learn?

343
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:05,830
Discuss with your neighbor if you want 2 minutes to talk.

344
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:18,690
Oh, you.

345
00:47:52,170 --> 00:48:23,520
Since 1986 the years.

346
00:48:37,100 --> 00:49:01,610
She? She?

347
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,600
Hey, since you don't need to discuss, then you must know the answer.

348
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:17,970
So let's take a look at the first scenario. Okay.

349
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:27,960
So if you stay focused on this scenario, if you stay, how do I calculate the probability of B winning the car?

350
00:49:28,970 --> 00:49:37,780
I don't want. And one.

351
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:49,370
Yes. So how do you calculate your choice?

352
00:49:54,530 --> 00:49:58,000
So using or what do we just learn? How do you calculate this?

353
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:05,250
Yes, she is. She is the equal.

354
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:09,430
P. Or is this switching or not switching?

355
00:50:10,170 --> 00:50:13,230
Oh, we are not switching. We are not switching. Okay.

356
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:25,990
So then it would be a one. You've been earning enough.

357
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:41,729
How about this? We take a break and then we come back. Finally, we have a halftime show tonight.

358
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:50,310
So if you want to sit down, just come back a little bit before to go.

359
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:55,660
On the other hand, I really think that the Reserve Bank focuses on that,

360
00:51:56,940 --> 00:52:46,450
which is what I think it's going to be able to provide, not surprisingly, is what's going to happen.

361
00:52:53,660 --> 00:54:11,490
So we have to be very, very that today in the second half of next year with these massive groups of weird things right now.

362
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:46,310
And what's interesting is that, I mean, I guess it's just not to mention anything, you know, it's not me.

363
00:54:50,030 --> 00:55:01,960
I don't like it anymore.

364
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:47,460
You know, I don't think you can learn how to do that.

365
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:58,080
I know what you want to.

366
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:57,300
The housing crisis once again makes me feel like it's not your fault.

367
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:20,970
They have found voluntary volunteer work.

368
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:39,090
My name is William and of course, I am the highest continental city administration of Korea province,

369
00:57:39,570 --> 00:57:45,180
southwest China, and only 23 kilometers from Chengdu.

370
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:49,649
And it was a very strong province.

371
00:57:49,650 --> 00:58:06,120
And behind me here and various Chengdu meet up and do it, you know, and this will help us to try to be single hopeful and try to prove,

372
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:21,480
like most Australians, a famous front and I would like to introduce do something special.

373
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:26,639
This is all you have to do,

374
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:38,160
especially considering as a driving body surface is I really want to choose a single in that place to find the next

375
00:58:39,090 --> 00:58:51,270
rock during this rain has a distinctive smoky aromas of the cultures and this is called nonalcoholic spicy rabbit.

376
00:58:52,110 --> 00:58:53,939
You know, it's really scary.

377
00:58:53,940 --> 00:59:09,180
So if are nearly 500 ₹500 million gain our customers China every year and as little as 200 million to 300 million of them in Sichuan,

378
00:59:10,530 --> 00:59:19,310
you do a magical thing to go to. The Sun is a famous historical city surrounded by mountains and rivers.

379
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:24,120
And this is this is the ancient city wall.

380
00:59:25,890 --> 00:59:33,660
And it was right on the wall, which is older than the land,

381
00:59:33,660 --> 00:59:44,910
which dates back from Ching Dynasty and more is derived from the tree which remains in the river in Han Dynasty.

382
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:52,860
Town was groomed, was renamed as Hangman's White and the hunt is white and hence the Yangtze River.

383
00:59:53,370 --> 01:00:08,640
This two words are also written in the book of some kinds of quiet chaos, which is the Han River is to pass screening process so talked river.

384
01:00:09,270 --> 01:00:13,889
So the river is a tributary of the Hungry River.

385
01:00:13,890 --> 01:00:19,010
Today you may you may have heard on the station.

386
01:00:19,020 --> 01:00:23,760
Do you or have seen something like this? It is a Bronze Age.

387
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:39,630
Cultural sites dating from 2200 B.C., 1100 B.C. located in the west and it is is en route culture and archeological not new run of what it's called.

388
01:00:39,990 --> 01:00:48,570
Its conversion was launched in 2021, but its early history remains shrouded in mystery due to lack of written records.

389
01:00:50,550 --> 01:00:59,370
The lyrics are from the same sites, are also worse off with and are vulnerable and are valuable cultural heritage of.

390
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:03,380
Mankind's killing silently.

391
01:01:04,010 --> 01:01:08,890
My life. I live about five kilometers from the same site.

392
01:01:09,260 --> 01:01:14,590
And I also want to save the zone and have Patricia as the greatest mystery I've seen

393
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:20,150
since I was a child and then proud of the ancient fast food culture in my hometown.

394
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:32,040
If you are interested in this, you can go to the official website and you can also take a bath for sure in this big book.

395
01:01:32,990 --> 01:01:49,960
That's all you. People realize that you can actually see your hometown because they want to if you want to,

396
01:01:49,970 --> 01:02:01,070
you know, your interesting and helpful recommendations to your range.

397
01:02:01,370 --> 01:02:07,160
All right. So let's now get back to this problem of, I guess, first,

398
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:14,650
let's take a look at how to calculate the probability of winning the car, which is really the event.

399
01:02:14,660 --> 01:02:18,320
I'll be interested in this case. Right. If you choose to.

400
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:28,160
So ahead, we can use this this total probability theorem to calculate this plot.

401
01:02:29,790 --> 01:02:42,140
It's just a matter of how all already give you the definition of this different events to help you establish this auto.

402
01:02:42,170 --> 01:02:47,630
If there is a total probability here, it's just a matter of to do the calculation.

403
01:02:48,620 --> 01:03:09,560
Anyone, the idea. Yes, this stuff is big, but I guess I'm kind of stuck on the way that we can use a one because like it sounds like we're saying,

404
01:03:09,590 --> 01:03:15,770
given that we stay given this switch and that those need to somehow be incorporated.

405
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:20,090
I guess I'm having oh yeah, I understand your confusion.

406
01:03:20,090 --> 01:03:27,020
So this stay or switch that's first that's not treated as a condition.

407
01:03:27,530 --> 01:03:32,330
Okay. So would suggest that the scenario employees are now.

408
01:03:34,700 --> 01:03:39,140
Let's just focus on the scenario of you going to stay with your first choice.

409
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:43,070
Okay. So that's the general scenario.

410
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:47,060
So then the problem is, what is the probability of winning a car?

411
01:03:52,250 --> 01:04:01,399
Yes. So then, given that you got it right, the first the probability of winning if you stay is first.

412
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:07,850
Let's express this PLB into this conditional probabilities.

413
01:04:08,210 --> 01:04:18,230
How do we write it? How do we experience probability of three times a one times the probability of being given

414
01:04:18,230 --> 01:04:25,280
a one plus probability of a two times the probability of we've given it to very good.

415
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:33,440
So again, this A1 and A2, as we argued before, is separate this sample space.

416
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:40,160
It becomes a partition of the sample space. So without overthinking about it,

417
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:49,129
you can apply this total probability theorem by directly re crossing this probability of event b into the summation

418
01:04:49,130 --> 01:05:00,260
of this two terms pay one times p be given A1 plus two times he became a two for any partition of the sample space.

419
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:06,470
If I always do it right, because that's the total probability theorem.

420
01:05:07,550 --> 01:05:15,170
But whether or not you actually do it depends on whether each quantity in this right hand side is easy to calculate.

421
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:21,010
In this case, it is actually not hard to calculate.

422
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:31,100
So now let's take a look at each term and determine what is the actual value of each probability on conditional probability in this scenario.

423
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:36,920
And always keep in mind now we're considering the scenario of staying with your first choice.

424
01:05:38,150 --> 01:05:47,930
So first and first, a key one is what's the probability of getting the car first?

425
01:05:47,930 --> 01:05:54,740
But what is that my third, right?

426
01:05:54,950 --> 01:06:04,130
Because you just take a random gas. Of course, you have a one out of three chances to make the right choice.

427
01:06:05,030 --> 01:06:15,380
Similarly, you can calculate this a two. If you do that right now, I have these two qualities.

428
01:06:16,190 --> 01:06:20,840
Now, the challenging part is there's two conditional properties.

429
01:06:21,530 --> 01:06:28,370
Okay? So let's first take a look at this one to see given how you want.

430
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:37,760
So the probability of winning the car, given that you gave the car in the first pick.

431
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:42,320
Again, recall that we chose to state.

432
01:06:42,620 --> 01:06:46,490
That's the scenario, right? Yes. Very good.

433
01:06:46,940 --> 01:06:54,500
That's one. Right. Because given this event, we done the car in the first place.

434
01:06:55,010 --> 01:07:03,920
And the scenario, the car scenario that we chose to state the probability of winning a car is one.

435
01:07:07,980 --> 01:07:17,300
Right, because the original choice is the right choice. So in this scenario, there's going to be one following the same logic.

436
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:23,970
What is this? Zero zero, right.

437
01:07:24,590 --> 01:07:30,950
If you didn't got a car in the first place and you chose to stay, can't get in the car is impossible.

438
01:07:31,930 --> 01:07:40,640
That's zero. Now you can plug it back in to calculate this plb in this scenario, which is going to be one of our three.

439
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:46,600
All right. So you can think about the alternative scenario.

440
01:07:47,080 --> 01:08:02,130
If you switch plates P of a one plate to a change in the in this scenario, you shouldn't change.

441
01:08:02,140 --> 01:08:08,120
Right. Because you want to make sure it does not depend on whether you stay or you switch.

442
01:08:08,650 --> 01:08:15,730
It's always one third. Okay. And what's different going to be these two conditional probabilities?

443
01:08:17,020 --> 01:08:26,470
If your strategy is to switch, then the probability of winning a car, given that you got the car in the first place now becomes zero.

444
01:08:27,550 --> 01:08:32,170
But the probability of winning a car, given that you didn't got a car in the first place,

445
01:08:32,530 --> 01:08:37,900
now becomes one because the host has already ruled out a right answer for you.

446
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:41,620
So B, these two are going to switch.

447
01:08:43,030 --> 01:08:51,070
And then you can calculate using the same total probability theorem to calculate the probability of winning to be.

448
01:08:53,380 --> 01:09:01,680
To that. And that is why we need to switch in the center switch.

449
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:06,680
As you can see, you pump up your chance of winning the card out.

450
01:09:06,910 --> 01:09:16,960
You double that chance of winning. So this is only one way to partition the sample space and to calculate the probability of the event of interest.

451
01:09:17,410 --> 01:09:25,170
There are many other ways to petition the sample space. You can think about alternative ways and you should get the same answer question.

452
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:33,940
So the equation for probability of B is that using the total probability field?

453
01:09:34,150 --> 01:09:40,270
Yeah, exactly. Because they want a two hour application of a sample space.

454
01:09:40,900 --> 01:09:48,580
Okay. Again, as I said, for any position of the sample space, you can always theoretically write out the total probability area,

455
01:09:49,870 --> 01:09:57,100
but not all partition actually helps you write some partition, maybe even more difficult to calculate.

456
01:09:58,690 --> 01:10:04,600
But there are some attention that may help you with the calculation that those are the petitions that I need to carefully choose.

457
01:10:06,260 --> 01:10:09,910
But then the final photo probably always holds.

458
01:10:10,390 --> 01:10:13,870
But I always apply the law total probability.

459
01:10:14,230 --> 01:10:17,830
It's just a matter of whether or not simplifies a problem more complicated.

460
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:27,190
Probably it's on the circuit scenario when you switch the probability of giving a one.

461
01:10:27,340 --> 01:10:32,810
Shouldn't that still be in the probability of be given to you?

462
01:10:33,070 --> 01:10:38,650
I'm thinking would be one half. So let's say if you switch, right.

463
01:10:39,070 --> 01:10:48,160
So the probability of winning the car, given that got the car in the first place is this one, then you already picked it.

464
01:10:48,350 --> 01:10:53,690
You want to take it, but you switch. So not that that's a game.

465
01:10:53,710 --> 01:11:01,540
So you first make a choice and then the house open one of the doors that doesn't have a car behind it, then ask you whether you want to switch or not.

466
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:07,150
So you have two strategies. One. One is you stay with the original choice.

467
01:11:07,510 --> 01:11:12,100
The other strategy is you switch to the other one. Okay.

468
01:11:12,220 --> 01:11:19,120
So on the second scenario, we are just talking about when is the probability of winning the car if you chose to switch.

469
01:11:19,570 --> 01:11:23,440
So it's not like you're picking a door and then you're opening that. So you do not open it.

470
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:29,410
You just stand in front of it. And then the host open another door and ask you, why do you want to switch?

471
01:11:32,530 --> 01:11:37,950
And now. All right.

472
01:11:37,950 --> 01:11:43,200
So next, another very important theorem for additional probability.

473
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:48,360
That's the bare minimum is the foundation for Bayesian statistics.

474
01:11:48,780 --> 01:11:55,470
So many of you have heard the term Bayesian statistic that's a, you know, a big trend in this department.

475
01:11:55,890 --> 01:12:04,140
And the business Bayesian is arguably found that it is the foundation of the business.

476
01:12:04,910 --> 01:12:14,879
Is the page and statistic it is based on. So this provides a way to flip the probability around to express the condition,

477
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:19,650
probability of interest, and the function of the of the other conditional probability.

478
01:12:20,460 --> 01:12:23,470
Not assume that we have the following events. Okay.

479
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:26,910
A1 to An and B then.

480
01:12:29,630 --> 01:12:35,780
The bartender on set says that the probability in particular you want to hear is a plantation.

481
01:12:41,710 --> 01:12:50,890
Of the sample size. And then the base theorem just tells us how to calculate the conditional probability of each.

482
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:56,529
AJ gave up using the conditional probability of be given.

483
01:12:56,530 --> 01:13:06,240
AJ Say the only thing that's different from the left hand side, a real sign is just switch the order of this to even one event.

484
01:13:06,250 --> 01:13:12,450
What's the probability of the other using a conditional probability of the other event,

485
01:13:12,460 --> 01:13:20,500
given this event to really just to provides you a way to split the probability of two events.

486
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:26,170
And he says this conditional probability is equal to the right hand side for the numerator.

487
01:13:26,230 --> 01:13:34,150
As we can say, it's a conditional probability a be given AJ times the probability of AJ and the denominator

488
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:38,980
the just the summation of this conditional probability and the visual probabilities.

489
01:13:42,650 --> 01:13:50,090
So the proof is, is this one line or two lines are shown below?

490
01:13:50,180 --> 01:13:54,650
Just using this photo probability theorem has directly got it.

491
01:13:54,950 --> 01:14:03,919
Other uses the utility of this theorem is very general and we're going to see a couple of examples in a second.

492
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:09,440
But let's first go over the proof here. So you are to prove the left hand side is equal to the right hand side.

493
01:14:09,830 --> 01:14:10,640
I want all of it.

494
01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:18,170
You can either go from the left hand side, try to say if you can to the right, or you can go from the right hand side to see if you can get it up.

495
01:14:18,950 --> 01:14:22,220
So here, if you go from the left,

496
01:14:22,430 --> 01:14:35,080
you can apply the definition so it becomes the probability of b a che divided by the probability of B right and the probability of back.

497
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:47,719
Now you can apply this compound compound probability theorem to express this in terms of conditional probability,

498
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:50,620
I'll be given 80 times the probability of AJ.

499
01:14:50,990 --> 01:14:57,950
So that's going to be your numerator and denominator is just to be a which you count by the law of total probability,

500
01:14:58,910 --> 01:15:03,610
which essentially debut this denominator.

501
01:15:04,220 --> 01:15:08,030
And that is complete the proof, very simple proof.

502
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:19,820
Or you can go from right to left by applying this compound, this multiplicity, multiplicity theorem and the total probability theorem.

503
01:15:20,210 --> 01:15:23,900
And you can derive we've got the last, the very simple proof.

504
01:15:24,140 --> 01:15:28,010
But again, as I said, very profound utility in practice.

505
01:15:31,450 --> 01:15:36,370
So let's first take a look at the general utility of this in practice.

506
01:15:36,910 --> 01:15:42,590
It's typically used in the context where we want to know the probability of a particular hypothesis.

507
01:15:42,590 --> 01:15:50,590
That's true. So in practice, if you want to test something right, you typically have a prior belief.

508
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:54,610
That's also sort of the foundation for Bayesian statistics.

509
01:15:55,120 --> 01:16:04,330
They always have a prior. And so the prior is something that I believe is something that I want to further refine.

510
01:16:05,830 --> 01:16:10,180
So consider that you want to test the hypothesis, which is the event h.

511
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:16,060
Okay. You have a prior, which is the probability of this hypothesis actually held.

512
01:16:17,050 --> 01:16:26,379
That is something that I got from your previous research or from from your observational study or from other sources,

513
01:16:26,380 --> 01:16:30,370
from expert, from expert expert experiences, whatever.

514
01:16:30,580 --> 01:16:39,020
So that is something that is prior. So in order to test that hypothesis, we need data.

515
01:16:39,290 --> 01:16:42,890
We need to to to collect evidence. So that's the data part.

516
01:16:45,980 --> 01:16:58,880
So one thing that we can get from statistics is under the problem, under this hypothesis, what is the probability of having collecting such data?

517
01:17:00,170 --> 01:17:09,170
Later on you will learn that this is called the likelihood. Think we honor certain hypotheses.

518
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:18,480
You can exactly evaluate the probability or the likelihood of getting a certain set of data that is something that's calculable.

519
01:17:19,100 --> 01:17:25,490
Okay. So this page is known as party of age, probability of d of data.

520
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:31,880
Given age can be calculated using a model, using a statistical model.

521
01:17:32,540 --> 01:17:37,670
But what we really care about is the probability of this hypothesis.

522
01:17:40,070 --> 01:17:43,280
Given the data, that's what do we really care about?

523
01:17:43,910 --> 01:17:50,780
The other was given what we have observed. What is the probability of this hypothesis actually holding?

524
01:17:51,410 --> 01:18:02,410
That's what we really can't. In other words, even the evidence that we actually collect, if you conduct the study, given the data that had collected,

525
01:18:03,310 --> 01:18:10,210
can you somehow refine your belief and refine your understanding of the original hypothesis?

526
01:18:10,870 --> 01:18:18,130
This is the probability that we are after. So expressing this in this notation.

527
01:18:18,460 --> 01:18:30,580
This is p of age. Even the order to God, this place, given the we need that there are because these can be expressed as p,

528
01:18:30,850 --> 01:18:39,610
h, the or d which is the peak of an h times p h.

529
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:45,370
You were right not to be a hero.

530
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:50,110
But you can switch out of that too, because when no pe of the given age.

531
01:18:50,410 --> 01:18:55,750
We know your age. And for PLB, you can apply this total probability theorem.

532
01:18:56,590 --> 01:19:00,970
So in many cases this is also calculated all three components.

533
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:06,460
You actually can calculate what is the probability of the hypothesis game about your data.

534
01:19:07,620 --> 01:19:19,540
That is the foundation for the bit. So then once you calculate here each given which you then might replace your original image with a new value,

535
01:19:20,410 --> 01:19:28,570
it's not a matter of replace the original hypothesis, it's a matter of now you got a better understanding of whether all this is true or not.

536
01:19:29,500 --> 01:19:32,560
With the data in your hand, we have this additional evidence.

537
01:19:33,160 --> 01:19:37,210
Now you can make a better judgment whether that hypothesis is true.

538
01:19:37,300 --> 01:19:48,580
For example, if you want to test whether smoking is associated with lung cancer, you may have a cry or some prior knowledge that it may or may not.

539
01:19:48,850 --> 01:19:59,380
So that gave you the prior of this hypothesis. Right now, the bunch of individuals follow them up and say whether, you know, a bunch of smokers,

540
01:19:59,750 --> 01:20:06,070
non smokers to follow them up, say whether, you know, smokers develop cancer more often.

541
01:20:06,430 --> 01:20:11,230
All right, then that's the data. What is your original hypothesis?

542
01:20:11,620 --> 01:20:15,460
You have a likelihood of observing such data.

543
01:20:15,930 --> 01:20:21,460
How do go? What we really care about is given this data that you have observed, what is.

544
01:20:23,580 --> 01:20:31,350
It's the truth. What is the what is your updated belief about whether smoking is associated with cancer?

545
01:20:32,340 --> 01:20:36,390
So that's going to be this probability of each given.

546
01:20:38,550 --> 01:20:49,320
So you're just to use this to update, you are another study or update of your on your knowledge about the hypothesis given that you have collected.

547
01:20:55,190 --> 01:21:02,179
Other questions. Okay.

548
01:21:02,180 --> 01:21:08,740
So we're going to have a couple of examples in the in the homework questions where you practice using this debate.

549
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:15,080
And there you will see how we can actually help you update what you know and what you don't know.

550
01:21:15,260 --> 01:21:22,400
Okay. And that's let's talk about independence, which is a very close definition to conditional probability.

551
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:32,480
Okay. So independence, two events are defined to be independent if and only if the following codes.

552
01:21:34,580 --> 01:21:40,580
That is, the probability of AB is equal to the probability of a times.

553
01:21:40,700 --> 01:21:44,500
The probability I'll be. That's.

554
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:53,600
The definition for independence. Whenever you say some some discussion about independence,

555
01:21:54,110 --> 01:22:03,590
it always boils down to this simple equation the probability of two events equal to the product of the two probabilities.

556
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:09,050
If the host, then we say it's independent. If it doesn't hold, then it's not independent.

557
01:22:09,650 --> 01:22:15,830
Later on, we'll learn about random parallels. We'll talk about the independence of random variables by end of the day.

558
01:22:16,220 --> 01:22:19,970
It's all boils down to this equality.

559
01:22:22,650 --> 01:22:28,110
So it has to equivalent form of pay and PBE are not equal to zero one.

560
01:22:28,110 --> 01:22:31,620
Is that the conditional probability of a given B is equal to eight.

561
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:35,910
The other is probably to be given A is equal to the probability of B.

562
01:22:37,110 --> 01:22:41,700
These are equivalent form if A and B has positive probabilities.

563
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:55,090
So the original definition, I guess the original definition does not need these conditions.

564
01:22:56,290 --> 01:23:00,640
This these conditions only apply to the equivalent definitions.

565
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:09,130
So in that sense, the original definition is more general and applies to any event, any event, even with zero probability.

566
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:14,860
So now let's first look at why they are equivalent under these constraints and

567
01:23:14,860 --> 01:23:20,110
then talk about why you do not need this constraint on our original definition.

568
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:26,290
So first but first we have this one, two and three.

569
01:23:26,710 --> 01:23:29,980
We want to show one is equivalent to two, equivalent to three.

570
01:23:30,310 --> 01:23:38,130
So what do we need to do? Is one imply two, five, three, three, three, five, one.

571
01:23:38,530 --> 01:23:44,710
If we can somehow show the three, then we can conclude they are equivalent.

572
01:23:45,380 --> 01:23:56,440
Right? So let's first try. Why imply two if we have one PB equal two times?

573
01:23:56,440 --> 01:24:02,450
PB Do we have to give and be equal to to ask where we are?

574
01:24:02,450 --> 01:24:15,459
One. That's what we want to show. Okay. So pay given B by definition that's PB over.

575
01:24:15,460 --> 01:24:25,450
PB Since we know PB is equal to paid PB directly plug it in cancels out.

576
01:24:25,450 --> 01:24:29,650
PB and that end up with.

577
01:24:31,860 --> 01:24:36,870
So that shows why he applies to. All right.

578
01:24:37,710 --> 01:24:42,330
Similarly to implies three.

579
01:24:46,660 --> 01:24:52,000
P e a can use the definition.

580
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:55,690
So it's going to be GAAP over here, right?

581
01:24:56,290 --> 01:25:00,630
So here actually you can use this be a theorem to switch the order, right?

582
01:25:00,970 --> 01:25:07,630
Because from 2 to 3 you say the only thing that's different on the left is you switch the order of A and B.

583
01:25:08,050 --> 01:25:14,560
So that reminds us of using the vehicle to use the bathroom becomes PB given a.

584
01:25:20,010 --> 01:25:29,770
He gave a B, B over here and now says pay given B is pay.

585
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:38,450
So we have. TV, loved the band, also complete the group.

586
01:25:38,810 --> 01:25:42,680
And then finally 3 to 1.

587
01:25:45,160 --> 01:25:53,680
You can follow the same logic. Okay, I'll leave it to you. And now we have shown that all three are equivalent.

588
01:25:54,490 --> 01:26:00,520
Just following definition, it's just fell through.

589
01:26:00,660 --> 01:26:08,130
Hey. Now let's take a closer look at this additional concern, of course, with this constraint.

590
01:26:08,490 --> 01:26:14,040
All three, they are equivalent. And given BP became a name, they are all well defined.

591
01:26:14,370 --> 01:26:22,740
That's good. But if one of the event has zero probability, then either two or three would not make sense.

592
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:26,130
Would not be wildly fun. But what about the first one?

593
01:26:28,190 --> 01:26:34,310
If A or B have zero probability, does it still is there still a well defined?

594
01:26:37,740 --> 01:26:45,060
It is right, because it doesn't involve any conditional probability or any ratio.

595
01:26:45,510 --> 01:26:52,170
So it's not a fact that you can have a zero probability or B have zero probability.

596
01:26:52,620 --> 01:27:03,060
And if you play, I am not sure you can say that if aa0 probability or B has zero probability, both side will have both be equal to zero.

597
01:27:03,630 --> 01:27:06,670
It still holds. Okay.

598
01:27:07,070 --> 01:27:08,720
So that's actually a trigger race.

599
01:27:10,580 --> 01:27:21,050
So that's why the first equation is the most general definition is not affected by this extreme case of a zero probability event.

600
01:27:22,010 --> 01:27:31,550
But if you want to use three, r, two or three as the definition of independence, you need to have this additional constraint, which can be a hassle.

601
01:27:32,360 --> 01:27:45,110
So in practice, people just use the three interchangeably, but one definitely is more general content and covers more general scenario.

602
01:27:51,110 --> 01:27:54,980
So that's the definition of independence and some equivalent representation.

603
01:27:55,670 --> 01:27:58,790
Now, we could take a closer look at two on three.

604
01:28:00,350 --> 01:28:04,040
You can try to rationalize why that implies independence.

605
01:28:05,030 --> 01:28:09,859
So if probability of A given B is equal to the probability of N, conceptually,

606
01:28:09,860 --> 01:28:16,340
what that means is that given B has occurred, it doesn't really affect the probability of event.

607
01:28:18,350 --> 01:28:27,020
That's independence, right? Whether you have the occurred or not, it doesn't really affect your chance of having a.

608
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:36,050
That's exactly what independence means. Given that the first child is a boy or a girl.

609
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:39,710
Doesn't really affect what a second child is. A boy.

610
01:28:40,430 --> 01:28:48,580
That's independence. Similarly, given a p probability of being given a called a probability of being being sustained.

611
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:54,950
So that is why these are these conditional probability.

612
01:28:54,950 --> 01:29:03,440
It can also be used to define independence. That's just the rationale behind this equivalence.

613
01:29:06,930 --> 01:29:16,870
Questions. The couple, they're more independent and they are independent.

614
01:29:16,870 --> 01:29:27,850
By the way, if they are beyond independent, we typically write it at A perpendicular to B, that's just a notation that are commonly used.

615
01:29:28,660 --> 01:29:37,600
So if A and B are independent, then we can show that A and B complement are also B complement and B are also independent.

616
01:29:38,110 --> 01:29:41,160
A complement and B complement. Also independent.

617
01:29:43,950 --> 01:29:49,290
So first, let's try to rationalize this. If two events, they are independent.

618
01:29:50,010 --> 01:29:53,760
If you take the compliment, does it shouldn't affect your independence?

619
01:29:54,810 --> 01:30:04,200
Right. And behind even if you take the complement, they should still be independent, at least conceptually, should be intuitive.

620
01:30:04,740 --> 01:30:09,600
And now, in order to formally probe this, we have to follow the definition.

621
01:30:12,060 --> 01:30:17,370
I'll just show you maybe one to just give you a sense of why that's the case.

622
01:30:17,530 --> 01:30:34,489
Okay, so. Your Honor, to show NBC compliments.

623
01:30:34,490 --> 01:30:38,570
They are independent. All of the definition. This is what I need to show.

624
01:30:39,380 --> 01:30:49,760
The probability of A and B compliment is equal to the product of probability of a times, the product, the probability of being outcome.

625
01:30:50,840 --> 01:31:00,620
This is what do we want, right? So now let's say, how do we get it to the left hand side?

626
01:31:01,370 --> 01:31:11,510
A B complement is equal to a.

627
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:57,520
Another way. The first thing we can notice that.

628
01:32:03,540 --> 01:32:10,410
This AEB compliment can be expressed in an alternative way.

629
01:32:10,710 --> 01:32:17,220
Oh yeah. Two words. You can start from A and express A as a B compliment union A and B.

630
01:32:19,060 --> 01:32:27,390
Okay. And the reason why we want to express it in this, too, is that in the union of the two is we can't be going to be mutually exclusive.

631
01:32:28,680 --> 01:32:40,550
So the probability of a going to be the probability of A, B, C, but the probability of a B using the, um.

632
01:32:42,550 --> 01:32:54,010
The third axiom for probability function. Now we know that A and B they are independent, so PAB can be further in its process eight times PB.

633
01:32:55,270 --> 01:33:06,820
Now you can say you can move the second to the second term to the left hand side, so you end up with P, A, B, C equal to one minus.

634
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:15,130
PB And this term from previous lecture, we know this is ADC.

635
01:33:16,060 --> 01:33:28,660
So that was once we think so the key is really to notice using this set operation

636
01:33:28,660 --> 01:33:34,810
to express a into this mutually exclusive sets and then apply the definition.

637
01:33:35,980 --> 01:33:40,090
So that shows if A and B complement, they are independent.

638
01:33:40,630 --> 01:33:46,330
Similarly, you can show a complement and B, they are independent and they complement the complement.

639
01:33:46,600 --> 01:33:50,110
They are independent. I'll leave it to you afterwards.

640
01:33:51,790 --> 01:34:02,860
Any question about this. So now we have known the definition of independence.

641
01:34:03,130 --> 01:34:06,760
So that definition can be further extended to more than two events.

642
01:34:08,700 --> 01:34:15,610
But that is how quickly we got a very complicated one to go beyond two events, especially for independence.

643
01:34:16,330 --> 01:34:30,700
Recall that for independence, for two events, they wanted to define the independence to be to be this.

644
01:34:30,820 --> 01:34:40,330
Right. But if you have more than two events, let's say a one, two, a, and then there are two ways to define independence.

645
01:34:40,420 --> 01:34:45,820
One is called mutually independent, and the second is kind of paralyzing independence.

646
01:34:46,660 --> 01:34:52,240
And they actually mean very different things. First, mutually independent means.

647
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:51,270
Mutually independent means for any combination of these events, the probability is always equal to the product of individual probabilities.

648
01:35:53,160 --> 01:35:57,930
So it's crossing this formula. It means for every player.

649
01:35:58,230 --> 01:36:03,030
You can always express it into this currency equation by a triplet,

650
01:36:03,490 --> 01:36:09,450
always expressing the second and all the way to the combination or the unit

651
01:36:09,880 --> 01:36:15,450
intersection of all events can be expressed as the product of individual property.

652
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:21,510
If all this in credit inequalities are satisfied, they are called.

653
01:36:21,720 --> 01:36:33,260
They want to be and they are useful, independent. As a comparison paralyze independent of the name suggests it just cares about the pairs.

654
01:36:33,590 --> 01:36:48,550
So just the first question. As long as I'm not a quarter j.

655
01:36:48,730 --> 01:36:51,910
If you have eight equal times.

656
01:36:52,240 --> 01:36:56,200
J. We call A1 to and they are pairwise independent.

657
01:36:57,520 --> 01:37:04,030
So the name is pretty suggest that mutually independent means you can take any arbitrary combination.

658
01:37:04,420 --> 01:37:07,570
They always satisfy basic equality.

659
01:37:08,140 --> 01:37:19,140
Paralyzed. Just care about the case. So which one do you think is is stronger, mutually independent?

660
01:37:19,420 --> 01:37:28,530
Right. Because apparently they require additional constraints, paralyzing the kind of just a special mutually dependent.

661
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:38,250
Is this a special case of paralyzing the budget? So mutually independence implies paralyzing a not the other way around.

662
01:37:39,110 --> 01:37:47,160
And if you have mutually independent, if not only have paralyzing budget and not the only way around.

663
01:37:49,170 --> 01:37:52,760
Right. So mutually independent is definitely stronger.

664
01:37:58,250 --> 01:38:08,570
Later on, we will construct an example where you can say we actually do have Paraguay's independence and not mutually independence example.

665
01:38:09,650 --> 01:38:17,060
So as I just argued in the previous slide, usually independent is stronger, so it implies Paraguay's and not the other way around.

666
01:38:17,670 --> 01:38:20,690
Right now let's take a look at the examples.

667
01:38:22,550 --> 01:38:27,110
First example coming from the task, of course.

668
01:38:29,270 --> 01:38:33,470
Two high rise. I see.

669
01:38:35,950 --> 01:38:42,390
In a row and you collect the result. Okay, so our sample space is going to be all possible.

670
01:38:42,460 --> 01:38:50,970
Tons like one, two, three, one, so on and so forth, all the way to six.

671
01:38:51,500 --> 01:38:55,990
Okay, so, so in total we have 36.

672
01:38:58,670 --> 01:39:06,140
Oswald comes at the foreign events aid to be.

673
01:39:33,780 --> 01:39:36,990
We define event aid to be Davos up here.

674
01:39:37,740 --> 01:39:41,910
In other words, one, one or two, two or three, three or six, six.

675
01:39:42,450 --> 01:39:54,540
These are doubles. If the outcome is a double, then we call A occurs and event B to be the sum of this two numbers is between seven and ten.

676
01:39:55,110 --> 01:39:58,590
And finally, the event. See, the sum is zero.

677
01:39:59,160 --> 01:40:05,879
These two are seven or eight. So recall that previously we have a table, right?

678
01:40:05,880 --> 01:40:11,760
A six by six table showing you all possible outcomes or this 36 now.

679
01:40:13,130 --> 01:40:20,610
Okay, run to that table. You can easily get the probability of eight comparability IP and probability.

680
01:40:21,660 --> 01:40:24,680
So you can verify this the result of the clock.

681
01:40:24,710 --> 01:40:30,220
And I'll just give you an answer right away. So here, are you going to be six over 36?

682
01:40:30,270 --> 01:40:41,040
So one over six should be is one over two and see is one over.

683
01:40:45,670 --> 01:40:50,560
And IPO A, B and C.

684
01:40:54,900 --> 01:40:59,160
What would be the event that's indicated by ABC?

685
01:41:03,210 --> 01:41:08,910
Somebody said I got some say eight and.

686
01:41:11,400 --> 01:41:16,420
It's a. Right. So what is. What's the case? Has to be fought for, right?

687
01:41:17,240 --> 01:41:21,620
Not the only possible outcome for A, B and C.

688
01:41:22,160 --> 01:41:32,180
So that essentially means for for and the probability of that you can see is one over 36.

689
01:41:39,530 --> 01:41:53,940
So there's one more thing I'd say you can easily verify that's equal to pay fines, TB Fines PC and furthermore, for it to be.

690
01:41:57,170 --> 01:42:05,640
What is the event? What is double and the same is between seven and ten.

691
01:42:09,030 --> 01:42:15,840
Two cases. Right. By five or 45 or 44 or more.

692
01:42:16,140 --> 01:42:19,960
So two out of 36. Okay.

693
01:42:20,430 --> 01:42:24,600
So that's going to be 118, which is also equal to.

694
01:42:25,340 --> 01:42:29,900
Oh, which is not equal to the times.

695
01:42:31,210 --> 01:42:50,040
Debbie. Okay. So similarly, you can calculate this P, B, C if you refer to the table, that's going to be 11 over 36.

696
01:42:50,040 --> 01:42:56,249
Again, not equal to tbe times and so on, so forth.

697
01:42:56,250 --> 01:42:57,660
So you can calculate all of these,

698
01:42:58,440 --> 01:43:07,680
analyze events and triple in some events and say whether they are equal to their counterparts in the protocol, evaluate them.

699
01:43:08,610 --> 01:43:13,410
But this just tells us what are these ABC Independent.

700
01:43:18,100 --> 01:43:26,680
Now we have to refer to the definition, right? Apparently, B and C, they are not independent and B, they are not independent either.

701
01:43:27,220 --> 01:43:35,770
Even though the ABC equal to pay times PB times, ABC doesn't imply each pair of the events would be independent.

702
01:43:37,450 --> 01:43:41,440
So you fact this in this case A, B and C, B are not independent.

703
01:43:42,220 --> 01:43:52,780
So that's just following that definition. Okay. So this example just shows you that the events can be not independent at the same time.

704
01:43:52,990 --> 01:43:54,820
You can still have the probability of.

705
01:43:56,910 --> 01:44:02,910
But the unions are the intersection of all of the events being equal to the turnout of individual probabilities.

706
01:44:03,630 --> 01:44:07,020
That does not tells you if the event is independent or not.

707
01:44:07,590 --> 01:44:15,030
It's just a position you need to check. It's a necessary condition for independence, but not a sufficient condition.

708
01:44:16,420 --> 01:44:25,580
But this is what this exam points about. Okay.

709
01:44:26,530 --> 01:44:57,310
So the next example is. Consider the altered permutation of this three letters A, B, and C and all the triplets.

710
01:44:58,780 --> 01:45:05,020
In other words, we consider the sample space to be a b, c.

711
01:45:05,560 --> 01:45:09,510
A c p b e.

712
01:45:09,520 --> 01:45:17,250
A c e c i c c c a b c p.

713
01:45:18,370 --> 01:45:28,419
Okay. We consider the small space of this nine possible arrangements so we define them to have a equal probability.

714
01:45:28,420 --> 01:45:32,740
So each outcome has exactly a probability one overnight.

715
01:45:33,640 --> 01:45:41,590
So that's the setup. Now we define the event pi to be the highest place.

716
01:45:46,810 --> 01:45:51,460
It's the latter. Okay, so that's how we define an event.

717
01:45:53,650 --> 01:45:59,230
Then you can verify the probability of a one is equal to the probability of a two.

718
01:45:59,890 --> 01:46:03,400
Equal to the probability of a three. All equal to one.

719
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:11,340
Just counting how many how many events you have, comedy outcomes.

720
01:46:11,340 --> 01:46:16,050
You have each divided by the total number of hours, which is not right.

721
01:46:16,630 --> 01:46:27,150
So three. Each case divided by nine. So each one of them should have probability one over three verify this.

722
01:46:27,900 --> 01:46:36,210
And the probability of a1 a2 was the event of a1 A2.

723
01:46:42,770 --> 01:46:51,080
Yes, it it's very good. There is only one scenario where you have the first place and second place behind.

724
01:46:51,170 --> 01:46:54,940
That's the Tripoli. In this set up, there's only one place.

725
01:46:55,240 --> 01:47:03,370
So the probability is one overnight. Similarly, the probability of a one in three, the probability of a two.

726
01:47:03,370 --> 01:47:12,670
A three is always one over nine. And even more the probability of a one, a two and a three is also one over nine.

727
01:47:13,930 --> 01:47:19,030
All right. So we can tell by this probability by just looking at this possible outcome.

728
01:47:19,630 --> 01:47:28,070
So what this numbers tells us is that PD one, a two is equal to a one time period.

729
01:47:28,180 --> 01:47:31,260
Two. Right.

730
01:47:31,770 --> 01:47:44,249
So what that means is a one to a two of the are independent similarly pay 1a3 equal to 13481283.

731
01:47:44,250 --> 01:47:49,290
They are also independent. The two or three is also independent.

732
01:47:54,880 --> 01:47:58,390
So this just tells us that they are paralyzing about it.

733
01:47:59,410 --> 01:48:03,580
And what about the triplet? 818283.

734
01:48:04,600 --> 01:48:11,250
Not going to. The protocol of the three.

735
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:18,690
But this is an example where these three events, they are paralyzing about it are not mutually.

736
01:48:21,890 --> 01:48:29,870
So this is a particular kind of struggling example just to show you that events can be pairwise independent and not mutually independent.

737
01:48:30,470 --> 01:48:35,150
So this is a direct example of that.

738
01:48:36,770 --> 01:48:47,720
So this also tells us something that when you want to win, you want to identify whether a pair of events are independent or not.

739
01:48:48,410 --> 01:48:51,470
Don't just look at how we describe the event.

740
01:48:51,620 --> 01:48:58,280
Sometimes it's not very straightforward whether the two events should be independent or not, just based on the description.

741
01:48:58,850 --> 01:49:08,239
I don't mind this setup. The first place is a versus a second place as conceptually or just by looking at this description,

742
01:49:08,240 --> 01:49:14,390
it doesn't really it's not very obvious whether this two events should be independent or not.

743
01:49:15,320 --> 01:49:26,480
We should always go back to the original definition and check whether these imply that if the inquiry holds,

744
01:49:27,020 --> 01:49:29,900
no matter how bizarre the descriptions are,

745
01:49:30,470 --> 01:49:39,260
we can still declare they are independent if this inquiry does not hold, even if they may sound like they are independent events, they are not.

746
01:49:39,800 --> 01:49:44,810
And really everything is boils down to this fundamental mathematical definition.

747
01:49:45,680 --> 01:49:51,440
You always need to check whether the probability is equal to the product of the individual problem,

748
01:49:51,440 --> 01:49:57,560
but that's the definition of independence, and that's the most important.
