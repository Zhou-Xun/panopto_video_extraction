1
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:12,430
Welcome to Public Health 512 The First Discussion Section.

2
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:18,150
I apologize for my voice. I've had allergies and had no voice at all yesterday.

3
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:27,959
So lucky you today. This is section two and just make sure you're in the right room, I suppose.

4
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,830
And my name is Chris Crew. Christopher Crow's my full name.

5
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:43,979
My training. I have a background in a degree in business, administration, microbiology and an MPH from the University of Michigan.

6
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:48,120
And I'm a second year in the Ph.D. program in epidemiology.

7
00:00:49,050 --> 00:01:01,410
I passed the COP exams, and now I moved on to doing my actual research, which is where my interests are in genetic epidemiology in the U.S. study.

8
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:06,920
Which has sequenced the whole genomes of a cohort in India.

9
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:13,310
Then looking into epigenetics, the social determinants of health and data analysis and how.

10
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:19,190
Post speech. I would like to figure that out.

11
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:23,000
Maybe you all moved to London where I just took a two week trip.

12
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:28,989
Academia and private research and consulting are also possibilities.

13
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:42,400
And I have a toy poodle named Avery. Which I will go home to actually in this class for all emails in this class you should send to the pub health.

14
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:45,800
Whatever as you wish. Or you talking.

15
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:51,960
Enter your email address. If it's confidential, you can email the teaching team member directly.

16
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:55,810
My email is listed here. See that you miss?

17
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:06,150
If you're not already email the accommodations, then email them to the public health 512 Residential email address or the teaching team.

18
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,879
If you're unable to attend the discussion due to illness or other reason, which I've already gotten a couple of emails about,

19
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:17,110
that you can contact the teaching team or complete the work out of class.

20
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:27,769
For our discussions. The sessions provide an opportunity for the application of concepts you learn in the lecture to

21
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:33,080
engage learning activities or the application of those things that you learn in the lectures.

22
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:38,570
So depending on the activity, if we have time, we review the answers.

23
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:44,990
Not every engage in learning will have a set group of answers that we can go over.

24
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:54,229
Some will just have concepts that we learn, and your answers will be based on your own choices for that assignment,

25
00:02:54,230 --> 00:03:01,190
such as looking up a certain research paper and identifying the key things in that paper.

26
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:06,200
Like what is their research question? How did they investigate? What sort of study is this?

27
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:12,150
Quizzes we will review and discussion after the window closes for each quiz.

28
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:22,549
So I believe you have one too. After this week. And later in the semester you will form small groups to analyze a research article

29
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:26,990
together based on your own interests and key concepts covered in the class.

30
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:36,470
Four quizzes, there will be ten questions for quiz that will be completed on canvas outside of class.

31
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:45,630
And they may include multiple choice questions. And some of these say select all that apply.

32
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:50,250
And I believe we might have taken those out last semester because there was a grading issue.

33
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:56,420
But if you find some. You will need to select all correct answers to receive full credit.

34
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:06,830
Some you will select from a dropdown list. There will be true, false or short answer questions and calculations that go into some quizzes.

35
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:14,660
You only get one attempt per quiz. And you may collaborate with peers to enhance your experience on the quizzes.

36
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:19,850
But if you don't actually learn. Like how to get these answers.

37
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:25,470
You will. Be sacrificing your own learning and it'll show up on the exams.

38
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:36,090
For classroom discussions, we will share responsibility for including all voices in the conversation.

39
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:43,340
In. Some people do have a lot to say, but we want to leave space for everyone to have a voice in the room.

40
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:49,390
We want to listen respectfully and not interrupt or turn to your technology,

41
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:54,160
like look on your phone or your computer the entire time doing something else.

42
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:58,870
And comments should reflect that you paid attention to the previous speakers comments.

43
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,950
We want to be open to changing your perspectives based on what you learned from others,

44
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:11,250
trying to explore new ideas and possibilities and think critically about the factors that have shaped your perspective.

45
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:21,030
Everyone brings their own background to the class, so we do need to consider that when speaking and interacting with others.

46
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:31,550
Understand that we are bound to make mistakes in this space, as anyone does when approaching complex tasks or learning new skills.

47
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:37,820
We want to strive to see mistakes and others as valuable elements of the learning process.

48
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:43,170
And we want to understand that words have effects on others.

49
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:51,250
Will speak with care. If you learn that something you said was experienced as disrespectful or marginalizing,

50
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,030
who listen carefully and try to understand that perspective and learn how to do better in the future.

51
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:04,669
And we want to take care or group work seriously.

52
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:09,530
Remember that peer learning is partly dependent upon your own engagement and the group.

53
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:17,540
We will understand that others will come to these discussions with different experiences.

54
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:24,550
We want to be careful about assumptions and generalizations made based only on your own experiences.

55
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,790
We want to be open to hearing and learning from other perspectives.

56
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:33,500
We'll make an effort to get to know other students.

57
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:40,170
Introduce yourself to students in your group, which we will do later in this discussion section, which will be pretty short.

58
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:49,160
There's only a survey and group where you get together to know each other and refer to classmates by name when possible.

59
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:56,330
And understand that there are different approaches to solving problems if you're uncertain about someone else's approach.

60
00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:03,520
Ask a question to explore areas of uncertainty and listen respectfully to how and why the approach could work.

61
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:08,790
And we want to be considerate of our identities.

62
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:14,500
There are many that are visible, but even more that are not visible on the surface.

63
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,960
So we're taking that into account when interacting with others is always a good thing to do.

64
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:32,300
And now we want to get to know each other. The Getting Acquainted survey is in the slides which you can find on canvas under this will be.

65
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:45,790
And it's also like right here. So we want to take 5 minutes to complete this survey so we can kind of have background information on everyone,

66
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:53,000
their preferred names, pronouns, other things that go into what you want this experience to be like.

67
00:08:08,014 --> 00:08:13,564
But who would like to begin? Who has been nominated from each group?

68
00:08:17,924 --> 00:08:22,244
Just share whatever you want to hear about what you found out about your neighbors.

69
00:08:23,174 --> 00:08:26,624
What the interests are in general plans.

70
00:08:29,544 --> 00:08:34,494
Hello. I knew who I was, and I.

71
00:08:34,664 --> 00:08:39,233
I wasn't going to go down. Yeah, just whatever you want to share.

72
00:08:39,234 --> 00:08:39,494
Yeah.

73
00:08:40,464 --> 00:08:53,484
There's not a lot about social media and what now and how we win that news that we're asking our voters a little bit about how their hearts and minds.

74
00:08:53,844 --> 00:09:01,403
But it is true that we think of the headlines in front of all the negative as the most controversial sometimes.

75
00:09:01,404 --> 00:09:04,104
And, yeah, the domino effect.

76
00:09:05,844 --> 00:09:15,024
And we talked a little bit about how they're politically charged and how they are sort of in a competitive and performative mode of,

77
00:09:15,024 --> 00:09:28,024
like, competition, trying to be the most involved or most aware person with a little bit of free time.

78
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:37,674
They're not like information overload. We don't care about trying to or, you know, we know what to work on time.

79
00:09:37,674 --> 00:09:42,894
And sometimes it can be overwhelming such that we just, like, stop looking at any time at all.

80
00:09:43,194 --> 00:09:49,464
Yeah. Sometimes we're supposed to be a break from the reality,

81
00:09:50,634 --> 00:10:03,584
and then the whole world is about reputable sources and a little bit about how we want to try to find other things and how these people are

82
00:10:03,654 --> 00:10:14,424
going to communicate and spread information to others in a way that is not trying to forecast people who are not like listening to our people.

83
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:21,684
Yes, that's great. Sounds like you guys went through all the things.

84
00:10:23,314 --> 00:10:33,314
The other groups want to share. Okay.

85
00:10:35,624 --> 00:10:41,234
I'm sorry. This is Lucia and Jason.

86
00:10:44,384 --> 00:10:48,734
Everything's good, and we're pretty varied.

87
00:10:49,724 --> 00:10:54,404
Three of us are important, but one of them is also huge for you.

88
00:10:54,764 --> 00:10:59,324
And then into undergrad. And then, um.

89
00:11:00,404 --> 00:11:03,964
Yeah. We talked about this stuff a little bit.

90
00:11:04,424 --> 00:11:09,074
How do you think people kind of receive your grade tapping protocol?

91
00:11:09,314 --> 00:11:13,364
Like, want to take it too early and not a tremendous positive.

92
00:11:13,454 --> 00:11:19,603
Yeah, I think it again confusion and hopefully like there is.

93
00:11:19,604 --> 00:11:23,883
But the news kind of makes people just like they feel this all the time.

94
00:11:23,884 --> 00:11:35,834
But, um, and then also Jason Living had a very close it down but um, before that and uh, I also,

95
00:11:35,864 --> 00:11:42,074
I just made it and then I kind of just, we talked about the differences between response to the pandemic and.

96
00:11:44,284 --> 00:11:48,004
Sounds great. What were the main differences you talked about?

97
00:11:49,314 --> 00:11:59,464
Um, and I had, like, more testing to hire people and, like, in lives and hopefully spend all their time testing on practices like restaurants.

98
00:12:01,004 --> 00:12:04,714
Yeah, great. Thank you.

99
00:12:08,734 --> 00:12:10,414
All right. Any other groups?

100
00:12:16,434 --> 00:12:31,954
I grew up representing a lot of varying industries that we were all interested in public health and then the stuff that we shows,

101
00:12:32,714 --> 00:12:47,434
where are we going to put it? What are the things that we are really concerned about that and also how we talk about it.

102
00:12:47,444 --> 00:12:51,284
Obviously in one of the three shows coming up so fast,

103
00:12:51,284 --> 00:12:59,983
that's one thing that quality and us we've got you should be concerned about information

104
00:12:59,984 --> 00:13:07,054
government to an extent maybe for security public rather than for professionals.

105
00:13:09,794 --> 00:13:13,844
To address the last question is what is our role?

106
00:13:14,234 --> 00:13:24,584
Because it's in our things supporting transparency and making sure that we put out the correct audience for the audience.

107
00:13:25,574 --> 00:13:28,814
It's knowing who you're speaking to is a great tool.

108
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:35,324
Thank you. Any one in this area.

109
00:13:36,094 --> 00:13:39,644
You all right? My name? Emily. Is she?

110
00:13:42,014 --> 00:13:49,504
Our media literacy and knowledge concepts.

111
00:13:50,034 --> 00:14:00,114
And, like, I would hope that things were changing so fast that we're kind of out and start at one to get more information.

112
00:14:00,134 --> 00:14:04,094
And, yes, change the direction we're going and what we want.

113
00:14:04,724 --> 00:14:14,234
And hopefully this last week we're doing that to show that people are experiencing that process like real are.

114
00:14:14,924 --> 00:14:22,004
Yeah it's hard to communicate that things update in real time when especially when something is new.

115
00:14:24,074 --> 00:14:31,274
So what is true this month? Maybe we didn't know that a month ago, so nobody should have said definitively this is true.

116
00:14:34,524 --> 00:14:37,604
Thank you. Any others?

117
00:14:37,614 --> 00:14:41,784
I'm not sure there were other groups, but it's okay.

118
00:14:42,994 --> 00:14:53,214
Yeah, that's true. But we had a mix of, like the ages of us as undergrads, very interested, some of them their future plans.

119
00:14:53,604 --> 00:15:05,334
I think we mainly talk about how over information around that affected like our own lives and like our own educational journeys in that time, I guess.

120
00:15:07,654 --> 00:15:13,554
All right. Thank you. I guess since this is the last slide, you're free to go.

121
00:15:13,614 --> 00:15:20,184
If you haven't completed the survey, then please do so so we can get to know more about you.

122
00:15:20,194 --> 00:15:24,894
But thank you and I look forward to seeing you in the future.

123
00:15:26,954 --> 00:15:30,290
You know, you're looking at this.
