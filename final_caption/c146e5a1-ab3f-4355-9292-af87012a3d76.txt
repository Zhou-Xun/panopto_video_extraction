1
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:06,930
Yeah. So. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm as she said, I'm Marie O'Neill.

2
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:12,750
Is she her pronouns and I'm very excited to see all of you and this kick off.

3
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:20,100
And one of the things that I mentioned to Dr. Handle is that I was I didn't get through all of them,

4
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:27,120
but I was reviewing the perusal comments that you all put on the research, and I really found them great.

5
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:36,089
And so one of the things I'm hoping to do is not to be speaking for as long as I typically speak with this introductory lecture,

6
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,150
but because I think just having a little more of an exchange,

7
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,660
many of the questions that you raise,

8
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:50,489
I think the my brief overview of what I traditionally talk about at more length will address some of those things.

9
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:55,410
But my hope is that we can interact. And I know Dr. Handle said that's not always going to be the way it is,

10
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:01,889
but it's just something that it was very inspiring to me to read your comments prior to coming here.

11
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:09,840
And I just think sometimes, especially with a three hour class, it might be nice to interact a bit more.

12
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:18,900
So if it's all right, I think I'm going to sit down because it will help me forward things and I can just hide the Panopto window for the moment.

13
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:26,800
So here I am. Speaking to all on air pollution epidemiology.

14
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:34,320
And I well, I'll give you just a brief background on me to to set the context,

15
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:42,840
which is that I after my graduation from undergrad, I worked for five years, including at the Environmental Protection Agency.

16
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:46,470
I actually worked in the indoor air division.

17
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:52,370
And some of the the readings and the questions talked about indoor air pollution.

18
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:58,530
So we do know that we all are spending 90% approximately of our time indoors.

19
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:05,309
And so that's a really important area. And that was how I learned about the connection between environment and public health.

20
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:12,570
And that inspired me to go on to get a master's in environmental health sciences and then a Ph.D. in epidemiology.

21
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:18,899
And I shifted to research on outdoor air pollution for my dissertation.

22
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:25,229
But I just wanted to give you kind of the the sense of the trajectory of my career.

23
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:32,850
I was one of those who, unlike some graduate students here, had no idea what I really wanted to study right out of college.

24
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:37,200
And so I needed to work and experience a salary of life.

25
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:44,970
So with that intro on me, I'm today just going to talk a little bit about air pollution epidemiology,

26
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:51,150
brief overview of some of the statistics that are often used in this kind of field.

27
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:58,620
I'm only very briefly going to talk about calculating effect estimates from model output.

28
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:07,830
I will cover that more in two weeks when I'll talk about climate change and health, because we will again be talking about a time series study design.

29
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:14,459
And that's a little bit, you know, not a run of the mill epidemiology study design.

30
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:20,520
So hopefully that will be helpful to give you some more intuition on how you go

31
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:25,950
from fitting a statistical model to calculating and then interpreting the effects.

32
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:30,990
I'll talk very briefly about some of the common study designs which were in the paper,

33
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:40,530
and then discussion of the paper will actually occur after 3:00 after you break into your groups at 2 p.m.

34
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:49,979
So, so I know a number of you have already been in some basic epidemiology classes.

35
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,250
You've been in exposure science classes.

36
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:59,909
And so we have a vast body of literature on outdoor air pollution and a variety

37
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:06,209
of health endpoints which were discussed in the article I want to highlight,

38
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:14,520
because people brought this up in some of the questions that some of the research you might look at these heart health outcomes,

39
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:25,499
death, preterm birth, but understanding causality and how air pollution may actually affect clinical function that

40
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:31,799
doesn't result in disease is also a very important way to study air pollution and health,

41
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:37,050
and it also helps make the case for causality and supports regulation.

42
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:45,810
So so that's something that has been studied in the literature and is an important part of the literature that we we have.

43
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:53,880
I believe that in some of your prior classes, you have talked about air pollution regulation and policy.

44
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:59,460
In the U.S., we have the Clean Air Act and.

45
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,370
Around that same time the EPA was formed.

46
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:14,510
And the Clean Air Act required the EPA and Executive Branch Agency to identify pollution that could be of danger to public health.

47
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,820
And the idea was that this is a scientifically based assessment.

48
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:29,720
So there's really extensive review of research on air pollution and health in order to come up with these health based standards.

49
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:37,040
And what they call them here in the U.S. are the MAX, the National Ambient Air Quality Standards.

50
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:45,230
The World Health Organization also has standards, but they're really guidelines that countries can adopt.

51
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:51,080
You know, W.H.O. does not have authority to set standards in individual countries.

52
00:05:51,080 --> 00:06:01,870
But in the U.S. context, we do have these maps and many countries also use the same standards or approximately the same standards,

53
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:08,600
in part because of the effort and resources that go into development of the standards.

54
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:19,340
So the Clean Air Act requires standards to be low enough to protect the health of sensitive groups within the population.

55
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:26,360
Some of your questions had to do with exactly that, and I hope we can discuss that more.

56
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:37,220
And that's defined as a group that may demonstrate a response to pollution at a lower concentration or a stronger response than the average.

57
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:46,310
And then the next slide is the actual national ambient air quality standards.

58
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:52,129
So we have lead continues to be an ambient air quality standard,

59
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:58,370
although now we don't have leaded gasoline in the United States, but we have the gaseous pollutants,

60
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:10,249
carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, sulfur dioxide, and then particle pollution, which is regulated by size, not by composition.

61
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:14,420
And that's another thing that people brought up in some of the comments.

62
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:19,350
Someone said it was wild, that it's just regulated by size.

63
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:25,730
And so just to highlight particulate matter is actually a mixture.

64
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:37,430
It's an environmental mixture that is regulated on the basis of being smaller than ten microns or smaller than 2.5 microns in aerodynamic diameter.

65
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:42,020
And indeed, those smaller particles are better able to penetrate the lungs.

66
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:52,610
Coarse particles, you know, the larger sized particles may be made up of different kinds of constituents, allergens and other things.

67
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:58,339
So even if they can't penetrate deeply, they can also cause serious health effects.

68
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:03,200
So there are a number of sources, only a few of which are are listed here.

69
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:11,000
And then I mentioned the subclinical markers of health, which are part of air pollution epidemiology.

70
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:18,259
One of the studies all. Show us an illustration.

71
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:23,270
We used markers of inflammation taken from blood samples.

72
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:29,180
And the idea is that you can sort of see early signs of how air pollution might

73
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:35,150
contribute to the onset of disease or worsening of particular functions,

74
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:41,089
and that it's strong for the plausibility case,

75
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:48,940
which I'm sure we'll talk about more with the new we'll talk about more in the class with the Bradford Hill Criterium.

76
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:55,830
So in summary, air pollution epidemiology is a big field.

77
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:05,810
It plays a powerful role in the policy to promote environmental health, and it also helps establish plausibility of associations.

78
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:16,190
I would also note that there is a Society of International Society for Environmental Epidemiology, which Dr. Campbell and I belong to.

79
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:22,999
And if you go to their annual meetings, I would say at least half of the talks are on air pollution epidemiology,

80
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:31,430
even though water or other exposures are part of what people in environmental epidemiology study.

81
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:35,030
So it's a very robust field of research.

82
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:42,989
So this is just the review that that hopefully will draw upon the coursework

83
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:47,550
that you've had in the past about why do we use statistics and epidemiology?

84
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:52,680
We use them in part to detect and recognize patterns.

85
00:09:53,460 --> 00:10:00,920
Statistics can be useful for just looking at your data, making plots, histograms to show the distribution of the data.

86
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:10,229
And then the statistics can also be useful for building a conceptual model of what it is that you're actually thinking about,

87
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:15,209
the exposure that you're interested in, the outcome that you're interested.

88
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:22,710
And then, you know, a diagram where you show what might be these potential confounders or effect modifiers.

89
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:33,510
Just a reminder that, you know, you have to evaluate both confounding and effect modification when you are looking at these questions.

90
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:39,180
So the multivariate models that are often used in environmental and air pollution

91
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:46,470
epidemiology in specific include ones that you've covered in some of your classes.

92
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:56,429
Linear regression, logistic Watson regression, which is often used in time series designs and then survival analysis,

93
00:10:56,430 --> 00:11:04,200
which is what was used in the paper that you will be discussing in your slide groups.

94
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:12,750
And so I just wanted to provide this overview of generalized linear models.

95
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:20,430
We have a linear link function, and then this notation just shows that you have multiple linear predictors.

96
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:27,870
In the case of multivariate regression, they can be continuous categorical.

97
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:36,900
You can transform the predictor variables for various statistical reasons, and then you always have your error term in your model.

98
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:43,740
So in linear regression, the link function is an identity function,

99
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:51,570
and the error and assumption of the error is that it's Gaussian or normally distributed and this.

100
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:56,920
Brief example is from work that I did when I was a student.

101
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:05,010
And the context is that I was doing research on air pollution and daily mortality in Mexico City,

102
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:15,490
and I come to find out that the Mexico City government measures airborne particles with two different instruments.

103
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:19,690
And the question was, which one should I use for my dissertation?

104
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:27,070
And the question was also how different are the concentrations that you're measuring?

105
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:37,720
And here on the diagonal are the names of the five main monitoring stations that represent different zones in Mexico City.

106
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:44,290
And as you can see, when you plot them against each other, they're not really corresponding.

107
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:48,519
Well, you would want them to be measuring the same concentration.

108
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:56,889
And so we use linear regression in order to look at how closely they correspond and what's the slope.

109
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:01,719
Is there some kind of systematic over under estimation?

110
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:06,760
And so we wrote a paper about that because I couldn't even begin to look at health until we had

111
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:15,820
resolved the question of which particle instruments measurements we were going to use for the study.

112
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:27,489
So that's one simple example where you really just gather the data plotted and the linear regression of multivariate regression entailed.

113
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:38,950
Here, logistic regression is something that I'm pretty sure you will have covered or cover in more depth in your statistics classes.

114
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:42,250
And this is when you have a discrete outcome.

115
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,209
For example,

116
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:54,250
is it a preterm birth or a full term birth in the case of birth outcome literature or any of the logit link function binomial error structure?

117
00:13:54,820 --> 00:14:01,899
And I believe I in the interest of having more discussion time, I didn't include the example,

118
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:11,590
but I previously did some work and I'm currently doing some work on preterm and full term birth and that's when you it's

119
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:19,390
obviously either yes or no when you do your analysis of whether air pollution or some other exposure is associated.

120
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:27,910
So Poisson regression, have you all had Poisson regression discussed in any of your introductory?

121
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:34,960
Yes. Okay. Good. All right. So you have a log linked function here.

122
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:45,370
You have a question error term named after I think his name was Henry Poisson, the French guy who developed Poisson regression.

123
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:49,000
And it's often used for count outcome data.

124
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:58,480
And so I'm going to talk specifically about when you have that kind of data in a Time series study.

125
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:08,979
So the next example. Is from a project that I worked on with several colleagues from Latin America,

126
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:13,860
all of whom I met at the International Society for Environmental Epidemiology.

127
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:20,379
So I believe then we were in New York City and the group of us said, Hey,

128
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:28,810
we all have data sets that could be combined to look at the question Do air pollution and extreme

129
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:36,160
temperature exposures have associations with daily mortality in three Latin American cities?

130
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:46,870
You can see the affiliations. Nalini was an analyst here at the University of Michigan who helped with the data set organization.

131
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:57,160
But ultimately, this unfunded collaboration resulted in two papers that our our group published.

132
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:09,600
I was looking at the question of whether the associations differed according to education, and Michelle's paper was a focus on heat related mortality.

133
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:21,570
So I want to step back just a bit to illustrate a concept that some of you asked about in your perusal.

134
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:22,559
QUESTION.

135
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:34,530
So it seems strange to talk about chronic and acute mortality, but some of the studies talked about how air pollution can shorten life expectancy.

136
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:39,390
And one of the questions was, why is that difficult to study?

137
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:47,130
Why it's difficult to study is that you have to follow up a population for a long period of time.

138
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:54,570
Your question is, does living in a place with higher pollution shorten my life expectancy?

139
00:16:55,080 --> 00:17:02,610
So, you know, some of the early, early work the Harvard Six Cities study is an example.

140
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,770
They took six cities in the United States. Topeka, Kansas, was one of them.

141
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:22,070
Louisville. Kentucky was another one and they were able to quantify how polluted are these cities and compare line them

142
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:28,250
up and say what is the life expectancy of people who have resided in these cities for a long period of time?

143
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:37,430
And what they saw is that living for a long period of time in a more polluted city was associated with a shortened life expectancy,

144
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:45,650
controlling for all of the other factors that one would think would relate to the life expectancy.

145
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:59,110
By contrast, acute mortality studies are asking the question What does a short term exposure to a higher level of pollution do?

146
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:10,430
You know, it is can we look at short periods where we might say after an ozone episode or a high pollution episode,

147
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:16,409
we can see that more people are admitted to the hospital or in this case, more people are dying.

148
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:27,680
And because there's something about that higher level of pollution that may contribute to people's physiological downfall.

149
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:31,520
It may be on people who are already sick, who are elderly.

150
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:39,590
But indeed, there is a huge body of literature showing that there is an approximately linear

151
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:47,920
increase in mortality for each ten micrograms per cubic meter increase in PM ten,

152
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:57,410
also PM 2.5. And this is found all over the world in all over the world in diverse geographical locations.

153
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:01,100
So how do we actually implement these studies?

154
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:07,880
So in this kind of study, your unit of observation is actually the day.

155
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:17,360
Your outcome is the daily count of deaths, which again is typically a pleasant distributed outcome.

156
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:24,350
And then you're looking at predictors. Let's say you're focused on air pollution, so that's your main interest.

157
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:33,410
But you also know that temperature may have something to do with whether people are more likely to die on a given day.

158
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:38,360
And then we also know that there are seasonal patterns in mortality,

159
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:45,050
and that's been looked at all over the world when people plot data from death certificates.

160
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:55,719
So in these methods. We also typically use both linear and nonlinear terms for the predictors because seasonal patterns,

161
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:59,830
as I'll show in a few moments, are not always linear.

162
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:05,380
And so it's important to have the statistical flexibility to capture those linear patterns.

163
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:09,640
And it goes a bit more complicated than squaring it, for example.

164
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:23,170
But a key part of this study design time series or study design is that only factors that vary in time with the pollution exposure can be confounders.

165
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:27,409
So remember that the unit of observation is the day of the person.

166
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:32,980
And so we have to think of confounders as something that may vary in time.

167
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:41,919
Okay. I mentioned that you do need to think about these nonlinear functions to capture

168
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:47,470
and filter out the confounding effects of some of these non linear patterns.

169
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:51,879
And so I'm going to show you next an example.

170
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:58,930
This is a. The use of statistics to just simply look at your data.

171
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:03,890
And these were the data that we used for those two papers that I mentioned.

172
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:13,370
So we have the daily death count here and then the time in days over which we had these data.

173
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:17,500
So the three cities, Mexico City on top.

174
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:22,850
Sao Paulo, Brazil in the middle. And then Santiago in Chile at the bottom.

175
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:29,630
I'll just ask any observations about the patterns here that you find.

176
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,140
Notable. Yes, sir.

177
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:40,950
It seems like the deuce kind of get deeper as you go up the, um, the x axis of this.

178
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:46,620
Yeah. A very extreme swing in the Mexico City.

179
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:51,299
Daily death counts. Yes, the troughs in the Northern Hemisphere cities.

180
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:56,030
So Mexico City corresponds to the peaks in the southern hemisphere cities.

181
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:01,320
Right. Exactly. Because right now in Santiago, it's summertime.

182
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:08,190
You can see a Chilean peach in your produce section because it's it's the seasons are opposite.

183
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:14,639
So zero in this case corresponds to January 1st of 1998.

184
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:20,610
And what you see is that winter tends to be a time where there are more more deaths.

185
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:28,440
And that's kind of what I was getting at the seasonal patterns and the yeah, the, the swings are extreme in Mexico City.

186
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:34,980
I guess one more observation I would just say is this just reflects the population size.

187
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:45,530
So the death certificates that that these data sets were derived from show, document, all of the deaths that occurred within these cities.

188
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:53,150
And so Mexico City is 25 million people, roughly, and these other cities are slightly smaller.

189
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:59,960
So as you can see, if you wanted to fit a regression to answer a question,

190
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:09,680
does air pollution contribute to mortality increases on the short term, you will have to think about How do I address those?

191
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:16,250
Seasonal trends because air pollution is what we're interested in, not this seasonal trend.

192
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:31,190
So the next slide is an example of the plotting out of the air pollution, as well as the temperature variables that we use for these studies.

193
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:38,960
And you can see the same thing that we see these seasonal differences in concentrations of air pollution.

194
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:44,690
And that was something several of you commented on. In this case, we're just looking at PM10.

195
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:54,950
You might see something similar for Ozone. But again, we're seeing these wintertime peaks of air pollution.

196
00:23:57,450 --> 00:24:04,769
And similarly, if you look at daily parent temperature, I like this one because having lived in Mexico City,

197
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:10,799
it just shows how temperate the Mediterranean climate is that this is in degrees Celsius,

198
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:18,240
but it never really gets extremely cold or hot in Mexico City or for that matter, in these other two cities.

199
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:25,920
If you did the same plot for Ann Arbor, it would be cool because we're experiencing a lot of cold and a lot of heat.

200
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:28,680
So these are our data. And as you can see,

201
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:39,240
we have to think about these nonlinear patterns when we combine the data to match the pollution and the temperature with the daily death count.

202
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:51,679
All right. So the next few slides, I'm just going to show you as an illustration of how would you actually do this nonlinear pattern modeling?

203
00:24:51,680 --> 00:25:01,399
And I'm guessing that this hasn't been discussed at too much length in your statistics classes yet, but it is something that we have to think about.

204
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:11,660
So this is from an earlier period of data, but the idea is you get these data, you can plot them out and you can see the daily death counts.

205
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:18,770
This is in one particular region of Mexico City, which is why the numbers are smaller and it looks like a bit of a cloud.

206
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:27,830
And so you can actually take a in this case a non parametric smoothing function that the

207
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:34,840
kind of averages over the time you know to see if can I capture this nonlinear pattern.

208
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:39,649
So if you have a an averaging window that's very large, you're not capturing much.

209
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:51,560
It looks like a line. But as you start to shrink it, you're able to better capture some of the what epidemiol epidemiologists do call wiggling this.

210
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:59,840
And you can see that you start to look at some of these peaks when you're trying to control for these seasonal.

211
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:04,960
Trends in mortality so you can isolate the air pollution.

212
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:09,730
You can also get crazy where you're almost connecting the dots.

213
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:19,780
But ultimately, you know, when you go through this statistical process here, I'm just showing that we pick the smoother.

214
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:30,490
That doesn't quite get to all these high peaks. But this was considered the optimal way of modeling the long term seasonal trends and mortality.

215
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:40,360
So models where you have these nonlinear and linear predictor terms are called generalized additive models.

216
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:53,500
And again, you can see you've got your daily deaths as your outcome and you include PM10 as a linear term that's applying for time,

217
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:58,780
which captures that. And then temperature is also you might use a nonlinear term.

218
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:02,860
So the beauty of these generalized additive models is that it gives you more

219
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:10,180
flexibility in modeling the data that don't necessarily satisfy the the assumptions.

220
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:15,130
And in this case, we're using a a on model.

221
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:24,730
So briefly, I'm going to talk about this, is that once you fit the model, such as our groups fit for this data,

222
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:33,730
you are going to get a beta coefficient associated with your air pollution variable and you can exponentially

223
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:41,920
rate that and then interpret that as the mortality rate ratio associated with an increment of ten micrograms,

224
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:46,900
with an increase of ten micrograms of PM10 controlling for the other predictors.

225
00:27:47,380 --> 00:28:00,820
And so if you get a rate ratio of 1.04, you see that there is an excess of 4% mortality whenever PM10 is ten micrograms higher.

226
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:07,930
This next paper I will go very briefly through.

227
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:13,240
It's the one where we had subclinical markers of inflammation.

228
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:22,300
The motivation for the study was that we've seen that people with diabetes may be a susceptible population to air pollution,

229
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:27,969
but people didn't really know what was the mechanism biologically.

230
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:33,760
Why would a person with diabetes potentially have a stronger response to air pollution?

231
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:39,640
And this was partly motivated as well that because of the prevalence of diabetes,

232
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:47,650
the role of inflammation and the need for mechanistic knowledge for making the case of causality.

233
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:57,819
And so we hypothesized that we would see higher levels of inflammatory molecules that might explain this increased sensitivity.

234
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:00,129
And in this particular work,

235
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:10,300
we looked at three different molecules that can be quantified in blood samples and indicate a general status of inflammation.

236
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:25,599
Then we had pollutant exposures to fine particles, black carbon, which is partly based on the it's it's a marker of diesel exposure and sulfates.

237
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:34,299
And so we were able to use that data that was measured at a single monitoring near the hospital where the patients were seen.

238
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:39,420
And these patients were participants in clinical trials on diabetes.

239
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:46,210
It was not the original study designed to look at air pollution, but we decided, oh,

240
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:51,190
this is a nice opportunity and this is very common in environmental and occupational,

241
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:57,850
more so an environmental that you would add an environmental exposure to an existing cohort.

242
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:05,530
So we did a simple cross sectional analysis among the participants.

243
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:16,450
And again here we just fit linear regressions, but in this case controlled for some covariance and the outcome of this.

244
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:27,570
Study was that we actually did see evidence of inflammatory markers elevated in association with higher air pollution.

245
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:32,310
The day before, I think I showed this. Yeah, we're talking about flags.

246
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:38,640
So, like, zero is pollution measured on the day, but like one is prior to that.

247
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:43,710
So we saw associations that suggest.

248
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,470
The mechanism could be plausible. Okay.

249
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:53,320
So I mentioned air pollution study design.

250
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:59,690
So we've talked in some depth about the Time series studies which are used to look at acute work quality.

251
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:09,800
The cohort studies where you follow people for a longer period of time or more often used to look at life expectancy changes.

252
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:15,559
Panel discussed, studies were discussed where you might recruit a small group of people,

253
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:21,980
say people with asthma follow them intensively over a short period of time,

254
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:30,920
and then controlled exposure studies which were described in the article as chamber studies.

255
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:43,680
One of you had a question about that. Any. Guesses or or knowledge about what would what is a chamber study for study in air pollution.

256
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:52,230
Yes. Is that when you put like you actually use like one of those?

257
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:59,850
I don't know what they're called, but there's actual chain chambers where you can, like, mimic what the air pollution would be like in that chamber.

258
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:06,590
Exactly. So I think Tim Devonshire and Stuart Bateman, you know,

259
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:11,220
have may even have like a truck or something where they've done some work in toxicology

260
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:15,780
where a mouse might be exposed to a known concentration and they can evaluate,

261
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:22,049
you know, physiologic response. But when I was a student at the University of North Carolina,

262
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:28,070
I worked for an EPA office of the Human Studies Division, which was right there in Chapel Hill.

263
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:37,080
And they actually had chambers where volunteers would go and say it was a study on ozone and lung function.

264
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:47,100
They would agree to spend some time in this chamber when there was a concentration of ozone and have their lung function measured or even,

265
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:51,120
you know, inflammatory markers in the lungs after the exposure.

266
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:59,399
So that's what they call it, a chamber, because you're in a chamber and instead of being exposed to the typical mix of air pollution,

267
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:08,160
you're actually exposed to one pollutant at the time because they're controlling, you know, what it is in order to kind of isolate that effect.

268
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:16,230
So that's why it's called a controlled exposure or it has to be done very carefully, obviously, so that people are safe.

269
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:21,449
And different people have different levels of comfort with the idea of doing that.

270
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:25,500
But it is a study design that provides important data.

271
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:32,140
My goal to make this short is not 6 minutes.

272
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:40,350
So I also want to mention another kind of study that is used in air pollution epidemiology.

273
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:50,760
It's called the Case Crossover Study. I believe I have that as one of the optional readings and it's very comparable to Poisson regression.

274
00:33:52,290 --> 00:34:05,100
And in this paper it's Chak Sajjad, who is a researcher at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, did this comparison.

275
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:13,709
And effectively, you know, it's a very similar model, but different studies will use either case crossover or person regression.

276
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:18,420
And it's they're both that with methods. All right.

277
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:27,300
So the Cox proportional hazards model is what we will talk about with regard to the Miller article.

278
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:32,460
And this just kind of shows the notation of the model.

279
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:42,420
And unlike other models, the effect estimate you calculate is a hazard ratio that compares the exposed to unexposed.

280
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:52,920
Adjusted for other predictors, there is a assumption you need to check in this kind of model and then the interpretation

281
00:34:52,920 --> 00:35:00,000
of a hazard ratio is a little bit different from typical effect estimates.

282
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:04,530
And so this is just some detail that you can look look at.

283
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:11,250
I used this kind of model before, and if there's some tricks to how you test the assumptions before you apply it,

284
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:15,600
but the basic data structure is that you, you know,

285
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:24,180
you have people in a cohort like the ones in the Miller study where you're following them up from a baseline and they may have the event,

286
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:28,379
they may not have the event they may have in this case.

287
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:35,160
I think this might be a cardiac incident or this might be actual death that they passed away.

288
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:43,020
So you weren't able to follow them up. So the different levels of person time, which must be addressed in your modeling.

289
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:49,770
Okay. So I am going to close these.

290
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:56,830
And stop the recording so we can have discussion.

291
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:03,590
And I guess I would look at this little green thing with the red light.

292
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:04,230
Okay.
