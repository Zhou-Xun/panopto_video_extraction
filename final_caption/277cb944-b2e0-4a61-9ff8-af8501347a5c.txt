1
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:09,720
Why is it so hard, you know?

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:20,760
I don't know. I think it was you know, I just I don't know anyone who goes, hey, guys, let's just go in.

3
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,769
Here's a sign, if you will. You just break it for some reason.

4
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:29,969
Your name's not on there and you think you're registered. Let me know if you can.

5
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:33,360
If you're not registered, let me know that to figure that part out.

6
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:41,700
Okay? Ken. Hopefully now everyone can see everything that you should see.

7
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:50,759
Try to orient yourself to what's in the canvas site. You can see all this, you know, detailed instructions for each of the assignments.

8
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:57,719
I'm just looking right now. It looks like the first, you know, any type of real assignment is this first 3 to 4 page paper.

9
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,990
That's you February 10th. So we're kind of good for a while.

10
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:11,190
And today I was actually having fun preparing for today's class and updating some of the examples that we're going to talk in a general,

11
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,900
general way about like evidence. Like I said, no, we're kind of swinging back to the evidence side.

12
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:25,020
We'll have a few more discussions, more specifically about the types of evidence that we're going to focus on in this class.

13
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:31,680
But today, we're going to have kind of a broad overview of all the different types of evidence.

14
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,970
And, you know, but I want to do two things before that.

15
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,980
First, I just want to like share this with you.

16
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:44,129
And again, this is I'm saying this because it's about the class, not like it sounds like a like a humblebrag,

17
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:50,610
but it's it's I really meant to be able to class someone or someone I know works at a at a radio station in Honduras.

18
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:54,659
She's on the air all the time. And she sent me a couple of days ago.

19
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,870
She said, I guess it's like International Mental Health Day.

20
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:05,009
I'm not I didn't know that. And she said, hey, I can use this like send me a voice recording.

21
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:10,740
I, you know, it's just something tell me what, what we should tell people that they can do if they're depressed.

22
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,299
And so I did that and it, you know, said, like, well, you know,

23
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:22,230
physical activity is important and, you know, avoiding overuse of alcohol is important.

24
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:26,700
Positive social relationships can be very, very good, etc., etc.

25
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:32,559
And I didn't think they were going to do this, but they like put it on the radio, like she put it on the radio.

26
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,670
So I wasn't really prepared.

27
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:43,800
We thought I was just like talking to her, but they put it out on the radio and then the the national secretary of health,

28
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:49,350
you know, their office, their Office of Mental Health, they, you know,

29
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:52,110
contact they kind of some of them actually already know me,

30
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:59,040
but they they contacted me about this thing about brief interventions in mental health and what people can do and what we can do.

31
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:07,710
That's very easy to do. They took the you know, they just took the they transcribed they listened to this, you know,

32
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:11,310
blurb that they put out on the radio that I didn't think they were going to put on the radio.

33
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:16,980
They transcribed it. They they just submitted it out into their newsletter to people around the country.

34
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:23,489
So why am I telling you that? Like, it's just again, it's just partly because it's the two themes of this class.

35
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:32,219
One, so idea of brief interventions in, in basically what I was saying, like, well, I'm this area, this area, this area, you know, these things work.

36
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:39,030
They actually can improve people's mental health if they're, you know, struggling with anxiety or depression or even substance abuse disorders.

37
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:42,390
These things work. We know what works. We know how to help people.

38
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,520
And also, like I kind of was able to do that in the language of evidence.

39
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,220
And so that's this other theme of the class saying, like,

40
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:58,589
we know that from scientific studies show that people that are abusing alcohol are more likely to develop depression.

41
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:03,069
I mean, often people that drink think they're drinking because they're struggling with their mood and

42
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:07,950
they're strangling with their anxiety because that's mostly mostly the opposite is true.

43
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:08,420
Like, you know,

44
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:15,990
substance misuse causes you to have more anxiety and depression rather than being like this self-medication theory tends to often not be true.

45
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:23,550
So being able to talk to them and they just like there's so many people, this is my message to you like these.

46
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:27,150
This is, again, like this way it's and it's not meant to be a humblebrag.

47
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:33,150
These are not like cutting edge breakthrough ideas of brief interventions and effective communication.

48
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:40,380
Many of these are based on some of these processes that have been around for at least 20 years.

49
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:46,500
But there's just this enormous gap between what people we know and what's been used.

50
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:49,860
So someone from the secretary of health this afternoon, she said, thank you so much.

51
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:58,570
I learned so much. And I'm like that, that you should you should know these things, you know, but they don't.

52
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:02,230
I mean, people don't. And that's Honduras. Yeah, sure.

53
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:08,590
You know, maybe they are a little less prepared in Honduras than telling you in community based organizations in the United States or even,

54
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:14,690
you know, some major health system. It's the same people don't know about these ideas.

55
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:15,799
And so, you know,

56
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:25,670
they give you is a you know if it is if you go out into the world and you have some basic understanding of how to become fluent in these basic ideas,

57
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:33,530
people will recognize that. And you'll be very valuable because they they just they're like so anxious.

58
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:38,729
I mean, anxious in a positive sense. They like so wanting to have some basic structure.

59
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:44,860
And for whatever reason, these ideas often don't get it out of the academic literature.

60
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:51,470
I kind of understand that as a producer of academic evidence and we'll talk about today, like there's a lot of skepticism about science and evidence.

61
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,520
Academics don't write in a way, and they're not good communicators.

62
00:05:56,510 --> 00:06:04,760
But the point is, so if you can do that, if you can kind of have this as a base and keep it somewhere in your, you know,

63
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:11,660
in your mind as you go through your career in public health or medicine or whatever related field, it's really powerful.

64
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:15,260
I mean, people recognize it almost immediately.

65
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:18,800
So I wanted to say that and I wanted to do this.

66
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:23,230
This is kind of a non sequitur today. We're going to like I said, we're going to talk about start.

67
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,600
I am more detail about our conversation of evidence.

68
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:31,100
But this is this is the non sequitur. This isn't exactly that.

69
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,530
But I also don't want us to lose that thread.

70
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:42,780
As we're going to swing back to the details, get down in the weeds, get down to the specific points of what makes communication effective.

71
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:51,959
So we saw the bad example of this. And I'm not going we're not going to I'll try not to stop it too many times because

72
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:57,960
we'll go through the specific strategies and kind of learning points as we,

73
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:03,780
you know, in a later session. But I might stop at a few points and I want to hear your reaction.

74
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:10,709
So this is the good example. This is that same conversation, but using some of these positive approaches.

75
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:21,030
And so, again, you know, these are all staged examples, but they're actually pretty realistic and reasonable and in pretty good meaning.

76
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:28,650
Sometimes they go more, they go, you know, easier than it might in real world practice.

77
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:34,640
Other times they're meant to show like positive communication. I'd say, like, well, I don't think you really should say it that way.

78
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:41,270
You know, they're not even that. So this is kind of in there. But by and large, I'm hoping you can see the difference between this and that.

79
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,280
The bad example of this conversation.

80
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:54,779
And the other thing I wanted to point out before we even see it is you'll see that this whole conversation and this,

81
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:59,010
I think, is pretty realistic in the context in the context of the theme of the intervention.

82
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:04,469
It's a five minute conversation. It's a four. And again, any say like one, maybe that's a little canned.

83
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:09,900
It might not necessarily always go that easily, but it's not completely unrealistic.

84
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,020
And we'll see some that are like three minute conversation.

85
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:20,400
That's often the concern, especially if someone is like a physician or someone working in other type of works in an emergency room.

86
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:24,900
Another place that will see people do brief interventions is they're like, I don't have time to do that.

87
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:30,360
They're really often not that long for this kind of conversation.

88
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:35,159
So let's see what you think of this. Great. And I just want to talk to you, though.

89
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:40,319
I'm a little bit concerned looking groups chart and how many ear infections you've had

90
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,309
recently and I noticed that you in check the box that someone's smoking in the home.

91
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:53,190
So I was wondering if you can tell me a little more about that. Well, it's just me and him and I do smoke and I try really hard not to smoke.

92
00:08:53,190 --> 00:09:01,080
Right. But I know I've been smoking for ten years, except when I was pregnant with him.

93
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:07,170
And everything is so stressful being a single mom and having a full time job.

94
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:11,280
And that was just that's why I started smoking again.

95
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:15,960
It was a lot of things going on and smoking kind of a way to relax and de-stress.

96
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:23,100
Yes. Yeah, some people have that one. I have a cigaret measure and it sounds like you're trying not to smoke around him.

97
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:29,400
Why did you make that decision? I know it's not good for him. I mean, I read those things about your infections and asthma and stuff, and.

98
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:35,390
And. But other kids have ear infections and their parents don't smoke.

99
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:39,079
So on the one hand, you're worried about how your smoking might be affecting them,

100
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,800
and on the other hand, you're not so sure if it's really the smoking that's causing these problems.

101
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:51,560
Right. Yeah. I mean, she doesn't have asthma. I don't he hasn't had a lot of other problems that his other friends have.

102
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:58,160
So and I've thought about quitting before in the past, but I just don't I just don't see how it's possible right now.

103
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:03,750
What made you decide to quit smoking when you were pregnant? Well, any comments so far?

104
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:09,620
Like what? What are you hearing? Like, what was different things? Yeah, there's a lot of open ended questions.

105
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:12,940
Uh huh. So that's a term that not everyone knows yet. We'll see.

106
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:17,300
Yeah. So why? Why? Why did you say, like, yeah, what is an open ended question?

107
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:22,100
Oh, like, just like it looks like the patient's doing most of the talking.

108
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:24,980
Yeah, that's. That's one, one key thing. Yeah.

109
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:35,360
You can look at the sign off and have a good conversation is that that often at least half the time the patient is talking and again,

110
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:42,589
when you say some of these things, they're going to sound almost counterintuitive, like, well, how I'm supposed to be like what they're you know.

111
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:49,670
But yeah, the patient's doing a lot of talking. You know, the physician is or whoever the medical professional is,

112
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:57,469
is validating a lot of her concerns and reasonings why she is continuing to smoke

113
00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:03,530
and not making her not sort of saying judgmental things or just telling her,

114
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:11,059
you know, it's bad for you want to quit. So but in a way, when you think of it this way, you can see that's almost counterintuitive, right?

115
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:15,500
Because it's she's saying like, yeah, I hear what you're saying. I mean, you smoke to relax.

116
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:20,900
You don't really have the time to quit smoking. Do like she's saying, I lose like why would you say that to someone?

117
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:25,410
Right. Like, you know that. Like Don't tell her that.

118
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:29,399
You know, they'll say, Yeah, I totally get it. You know, you're too busy and it's quitting.

119
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,590
Smoking is really hard, so I totally get that. We'll hear more of that.

120
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:40,530
And he's like, Well, I don't know if you to be that supportive you know some give and it's yeah yeah I mean.

121
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:45,850
I guess she's not really saying like, oh, it's like a good thing. No, no.

122
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:51,290
More like reiterating what the parent is saying.

123
00:11:51,290 --> 00:12:01,550
And then maybe that can help. Like if you hear back, like what you're saying, like you might be able to keep your kids and put a, put a tag on that.

124
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:06,350
Like, yeah, we'll come back to that. Yeah, that's one thing. Like, why would you should doing a lot of that.

125
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:10,190
You know, so I was just repeating like so what I hear you saying is that, you know, this and that.

126
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:21,710
One of the interesting things that's even a more subtle point that you'll see is even if it hasn't really happened too much yet,

127
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:29,310
but like if she said like, well, I really definitely don't I make sure I only go out and smoke in the car.

128
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:33,920
I never smoke about. She's not saying like, well, that's really good.

129
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:40,040
Like, that's really good that you do it. You're doing that. Like, she can be very, very neutral.

130
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:45,220
Right. So why would you be that way? Like, why would you want to kind of reinforce the positive, right?

131
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:51,530
Like, why wouldn't you do that? Even if she said like, well, I really tried, I'm going to try.

132
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:55,169
This is a good. Oh, my gosh. That's great. Good.

133
00:12:55,170 --> 00:13:00,390
Good for you. Like, why wouldn't she do that more? Well, you see in the really good conversations.

134
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:06,230
The provider is a super neutral. It's kind of non-intuitive.

135
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,370
Yeah. I think that she still, like, doesn't want to, like, reaffirm that years,

136
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:16,540
even though she is trying to essentially, like, avoid having smoke around it.

137
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,210
Like, regardless, smoking is bad.

138
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:24,180
And there's still and if she's lucky enough, for example, that secondhand smoke might stay in the car, like in my inhale,

139
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:29,339
and she's trying to make sure that she's not supporting those behaviors in more of like a sneaky way,

140
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:33,030
like going to the car or something and just making sure it's going to happen.

141
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:36,810
And that's a good point. The other thing is like when you know people.

142
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:43,980
There they again know. They know that they already feel bad.

143
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:50,610
They feel bad enough. And so, like, if you say, well, thank God you're not doing that, you're like, well, I don't always do that.

144
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:55,920
Right. You don't want to look like you're clearly coming down on a judgmental side.

145
00:13:56,190 --> 00:14:00,690
Even if you're really supportive of me, you want to be the more neutral they can be.

146
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:08,520
I use injection drugs, but I only do it with, you know, my friends.

147
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:12,780
You know, you say, well, thank God you do that, you know, like that.

148
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:17,220
They're just like, all right. Whatever you're trying. Okay, you know, that's good.

149
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:22,290
It's not about me. It's not about what the I the provider thing.

150
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:32,250
It's not out and not about that. So, yeah. So anyway, he was inside me and we were sharing everything and I knew that he would get some of that.

151
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:37,290
And I didn't. I just didn't think I could live with myself if something happened to him.

152
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:46,200
Oh, yeah. Here's another thing. Accent I will see. Because, you know, one of the main things that we're seeing is what we're not seeing,

153
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:50,010
which is that the last time, every time she's like, Yeah, but don't you realize.

154
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:56,400
Yeah, but yeah, but yeah, but you have it under the part of the provider. So when she says, I just don't think it's a good time right now.

155
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:03,080
Instead of saying like, well, of course it's a good time. You'll see some instances where the theme we'll see.

156
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:06,680
But bookmark is like kind of. It's called Rolling with resistance.

157
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:10,940
It's one of the themes that we'll hear motive in motivational interviewing.

158
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,850
And a lot of it is sometimes you can just ignore that, like, I don't think it's a good time.

159
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:21,290
And so what she said, I think, you know, about 15 seconds ago was so what?

160
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,360
You know, tell me about the last time you tried.

161
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:28,250
Like I say, like I'm not even address this thing where you're saying, I don't think this is a good time to quit.

162
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:32,120
You can just ignore it. We're in a slide right past that and go somewhere else.

163
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:38,270
These are all specific, again, learnable teachable strategies. The counterintuitive human manager even did try.

164
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:42,410
Yeah, exactly. How are you successful when you quit before?

165
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:47,000
I don't know. I, I think about how I don't even know how I did it.

166
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,220
I just. I just did it, you know? I just.

167
00:15:50,930 --> 00:16:00,680
I just couldn't imagine, like him not being born or going into labor early and and having problems and stuff like that.

168
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:09,020
All the stuff that they talk about with women who smoke. So I that was just enough to, to say, okay, you know what, I'm not going to risk that.

169
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:13,470
So the risks were so scary then that you're able to stop.

170
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:20,210
You don't feel too scary to you now? No, I went to separate people and like I said, I don't I try really hard not to smoke around him.

171
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:24,560
I'm pretty good about that. I don't let other people smoke around him.

172
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:29,940
So I you know, you're doing the best you can do. Yes.

173
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:34,530
But it sounds to me to like part of you really does want to quit.

174
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:42,410
Yeah, I know that. I need to. And I you know, every new year, I say, okay, this year I'm going to quit smoking.

175
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:50,070
But then something happens and and it just doesn't it's on your to do list is just not making it to the top.

176
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:57,889
Yeah. If you did decide to quit on a scale of 1 to 10 where one is not at all confidence, you don't think you could do it in 10 minutes?

177
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:04,490
You feel pretty certain that you could. Where do you think you are right now? Probably like a five.

178
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:12,400
Okay. What would be the typical thing to say? Two than five.

179
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:18,310
Are you kidding me? Five.

180
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:22,209
That's. That's where you are. If I like. And I.

181
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:25,510
Can you. Can you give me a six? Give me an eight. Right.

182
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:29,200
That would be the normal thing to do. Right. See what she does.

183
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:33,080
I'm kind of in that I'm sure area.

184
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:42,980
Like, I know I've done it before, so I know I can do it, but at the same time it just seems really hard and it's not the same situation.

185
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:46,970
Well, what made you say five rather than two or three? I know.

186
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:54,440
I know the way it is, right? She could have said, I feel like it's three, you know?

187
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,480
And she'd say, like, really three. That's interesting. Why not a two? Right.

188
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:02,049
So this is trying to get her to mind.

189
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:05,290
You know, let let's talk about that last time you did quit. You have quit.

190
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:08,950
Most smokers, almost all smokers want to quit.

191
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:13,790
Almost all most smokers have quit. I think don't help me on this either.

192
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:20,950
The the number of attempts to actually successfully, like permanently quit is like something like six times.

193
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:29,140
I mean, they but so they all have quit. So she's really kind of going back to kind of boosting up that sense of like, well, you have done this.

194
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:34,120
Like, I guess I did. I quit once for six months. Like, Wow, that's pretty amazing.

195
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:36,340
How did you do that? You know, so that caused it.

196
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:42,910
So she's kind of going in there and these are get it right and want him to grow up thinking that it's okay to smoke.

197
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:47,800
I want him to to use any kind of I don't want to chew or anything like that.

198
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:54,330
So I don't need to, especially before he gets old enough to understand what Mommy's doing.

199
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:57,910
But I just don't know if I can do it.

200
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:02,410
Okay, so it sounds like you have a lot of reasons why you'd like to quit.

201
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:09,280
You have been successful quitting in the past, and right now you're just feeling a little bit hesitant about your ability to do it.

202
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:13,420
Yeah. Where do you think we should go from here? I don't know.

203
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:17,650
I. I'd like some help. I just don't know what kind of help.

204
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:22,840
This is also kind of. Yeah, like a big. This is really key and often forgotten part.

205
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:26,780
Like while we just had a really great discussion. Let's definitely try.

206
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:31,850
Sounds like you're really interested in cooking. Good. That's awesome. No, we don't know.

207
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:38,750
Like, you know, like we're trying to get to. Trying to get to a commitment to a behavior change.

208
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:42,080
So where. So where does that leave us? One end.

209
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,360
You're not so sure. And the other hand, you say you want to quit.

210
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:49,459
And that's kind of fundamental, this idea of motivational interviewing, that we all have ambivalence.

211
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:55,820
We all want to do things that we're not doing, you know, exercise more, study more,

212
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:00,650
spend less time on our phone, Black says the things that we're not doing.

213
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:08,389
And so we're all just kind of swimming in this ambivalence and motivational interview is all about getting people to recognize that

214
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:17,330
ambivalence and hopefully get to some kind of pivotal point where they're making it some sort of decision to at least try behavior,

215
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,730
be sure. What if you're gonna be interested?

216
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:27,340
That's something I can definitely talk to you about. There are a lot of new options that can actually help people be way more successful on their own.

217
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:31,900
Tempted, quitting. There's different medications. You can try medicine.

218
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:38,570
Okay. There's also a lot of support groups and classes that you can take where you have other people that go through it with you.

219
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:45,320
And sometimes just having that support can be a big part of it, especially for people like you or smoking is such a stress reliever.

220
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:49,100
That sounds nice, but I'm not sure if I have the time for all that. Sorry.

221
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:54,170
It feels like something that would take up a lot of time and maybe not fit into your life.

222
00:20:54,440 --> 00:21:02,720
I wonder if we can talk about some options at least to say like I was telling some of the especially when we when we had our young kids at home,

223
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:10,459
the typical thing people say, like when people would say, I just don't have the time to exercise right now.

224
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:14,420
We have young kids and people say, you know what, you just got to make the time.

225
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:18,800
I hate that. They're like, What are you talking about?

226
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:25,609
Right? That would be like, I'm not hearing you at all that, you know, you're busy and she's doing the opposite.

227
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:28,849
She's like like, yeah, I get it. Like, you know, this, you know, let's figure it.

228
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:34,759
We can work about this, but just kind of letting that person lead the discussion into your life, that would be really nice.

229
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:40,579
Okay, well, if you're willing, then we could set up another appointment where you could come in and we could talk more about that.

230
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:43,790
I would like that. That would be great. Great. Thank you, though.

231
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:51,259
So okay, so there you can start to get a taste of some of these different concepts that we'll talk about in general.

232
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:54,649
Like I said, they're pretty powerful. They have been used.

233
00:21:54,650 --> 00:22:05,750
You'll see references to these specific, you know, ideas in all the content areas that they have been used and that we've touched on in this class.

234
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:16,489
Basically all these behaviors that have to do with smoking and weight and exercise and depression management and, you know, anxiety and suicidality.

235
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:20,730
You know, these are pretty powerful concepts that have been used, you know,

236
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:27,170
with different sorts of people because that you kind of if you only see this once and you haven't heard about the ideas behind it,

237
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:32,479
you think like, well, she's just a really good educator, you know?

238
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,770
But it's I'm sure she she might be some people are better educators than others.

239
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:45,440
Some people you can't train out of them what we saw last time that need to kind of dump information at people and lecture them.

240
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:53,629
Like some people are just not good at this, but most of them can get better and again, they're learnable teachable skills.

241
00:22:53,630 --> 00:23:02,540
So that is in one sense part of what we're going to be talking about in exploring how well they have worked in different areas.

242
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:10,170
But now changing topics today will. Switch topics unless someone has any other comments on their.

243
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:19,520
Come on. You need to get the laptop.

244
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:25,400
There you go. Yeah. Yeah.

245
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:32,090
So today we're going to talk about, you know, evidence and again, where, you know,

246
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:40,159
how we're going to in this class focus on these highest forms of evidence that I'm gonna explain to you today why they are value these,

247
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:47,240
you know, randomized trials, meta analysis, why the guideline sites that we're going to look at are so powerful.

248
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:51,240
And part of what I was doing that I'll show you, you know,

249
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:59,120
maybe if we have time before the end of class looking at these major websites where they they they're compiling all these sources of evidence.

250
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:07,249
They're answering with evidence some questions that we're we haven't even you know, we thought like I never even thought to ask.

251
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:08,530
So there's we'll see.

252
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:22,130
The one evidence review I came across today was basically peer mentoring to keep young adolescents from starting to use alcohol and drugs,

253
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:27,110
like, you know, having a peer, like basically a big brother or a buddy.

254
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:32,000
Like, does that work? Like, does that work? And I think, well, that's a really interesting question.

255
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,430
I never really thought about that.

256
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:43,579
And you look at the other stories like, well, there's been four randomized trials of that and we've summarized, you know, whether it works or not.

257
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:44,930
Like, that's really interesting.

258
00:24:46,040 --> 00:25:01,759
How about, you know, you know, putting up restrictions in stores so young people don't can't buy tobacco, do those work?

259
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:07,560
Like, do they actually keep young people from starting to smoke tobacco like?

260
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:14,630
Well, that's an interesting question as an energy policy question. Turns out there's an answer, you know, to that as a policy question.

261
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:25,040
We'll see something in a later class about you ever see like these those like Scared Straight shows where they take, you know,

262
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:32,920
troubled youth and they bring them into prison and they just scare the [INAUDIBLE] out of them and prisoners get in their face and say,

263
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:40,250
like, what does that were like? It turns out there's been like multiple randomized trials to find out if it, you know.

264
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:49,930
Keeps people, kids from dropping out of school, from abusing substances, from get, you know, getting involved in crime.

265
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:53,980
Like, well, that's interesting. You know, there's actually evidence. Right.

266
00:25:53,980 --> 00:26:02,200
So it's this idea of like focusing on evidence is really valuable and often not really done.

267
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:12,880
So I wondered, skip a couple of these here, if I may. The thing that for for you all like I mean, you have a couple of my pet metaphors.

268
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,330
Have you ever heard of that? Yeah.

269
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:19,630
Like this is the most common metaphor, but I say it in class and people were a couple of years ago that people are like, What are you talking about?

270
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:23,280
Drinking from a fire hose, you know? So we've never heard that as a metaphor.

271
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:26,670
The yeah. The drinking from a fire hose metaphor.

272
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:37,820
It's a it's a metaphor that commonly was used at least a few up to a few years ago to mean that you're trying to get evidence.

273
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:47,030
But what kind of like characterizes your professional life is this overabundance of evidence?

274
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:52,070
And so it's not that there's no studies of this, that or the other thing.

275
00:26:52,310 --> 00:27:01,010
So there's often, like, so much. Evidence and it's really the summarizing those studies is the challenge.

276
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,020
That's a good problem to have.

277
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:10,310
But I'll tell you, you know, I don't want to talk too much about the first pit forward yet, said I, just going to take the time to do it.

278
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:18,860
But when I say like, you know, find a study from the syllabus and find another study that's better because it's more recent data is larger.

279
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:24,410
A lot of time the tendency is because of things I'll say today about, you know,

280
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:30,260
meta analyzes and systematic reviews to say like, well, multiple randomized trials is better than one randomized trial.

281
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:33,979
And so that would often be like, here's a randomized trial in the syllabus.

282
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:41,510
And I found a meta analysis a few years ago. I was like, Nope, try to find the same type of study, you know?

283
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:47,180
But it's better for another reason. It's a randomized trial, but it's better for other reasons, because I want you to try to,

284
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:51,560
you know, you know, really think critically about randomized trials.

285
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:56,720
That's, you know, rather just going to immediately to looking and then analysis.

286
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,440
I still want you to do that. We'll talk about that more in another day.

287
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:08,330
But the the the fact is that in most of the areas we're going to talk about is very, very diverse areas.

288
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:13,790
There are now multiple excellent at analysis your evidence world.

289
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:17,999
Is often populated by meta analysis.

290
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:27,180
And so in one of the Cochrane Meta Analysis Review sites a look at, they publish systematic reviews on a bazillion topics, as we'll see.

291
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:32,850
They also publish when they have a review in progress that publishes the protocol for the review.

292
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,460
And you can see they're already like, you know,

293
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:46,470
so many meta analyzes that that will be coming out in the next year or two about like vaping and other types of electronic cigarets and electronic,

294
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:53,639
you know, vaping products for marijuana and all that. There's just like there's so much evidence about so many things that,

295
00:28:53,640 --> 00:29:02,820
that it's really that almost the the the emphasis even in this class, I feel, has this, you know,

296
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:07,740
shift shift disproportionately to looking at meta analysis and systematic reviews,

297
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:15,510
because that is kind of happily where, you know, you're going to be kind of living in your evidence world.

298
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:21,630
That's my one favorite metaphor. And this the other one, I mentioned it last time again, like some people were just like, what are you talking about?

299
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:28,350
This idea of like throw the baby out with the bathwater, which means that throw the baby out with the bathwater.

300
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:35,760
Is this you do kind of get this a lot where people are like, Oh yeah, those are five meta analyzes.

301
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:44,999
But I work down on the border, you know, in El Paso, and none of them have really represented, you know, Latino immigrants.

302
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,549
And so, like, I don't I don't I'm not going to take, you know, take any of those seriously at all.

303
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:53,580
It doesn't deal with my population, as they said like last time,

304
00:29:53,580 --> 00:30:00,360
you never will gets probably almost nothing has been done with your population in Washtenaw County.

305
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:08,489
One of my professional frustrations is we do a lot of research in the VA health care system and some of these very,

306
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:14,309
very powerful interventions that we've demonstrated that we know would work elsewhere.

307
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:18,120
But we're kind of decision makers immediately say, well, that's the VA.

308
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:25,530
I mean, you know, so there are some times when generalizability is something you should really take into account.

309
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:29,190
We'll talk about that more in in a future class.

310
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:37,530
But I want you to think in a more sophisticated way, like, well, if it worked in the VA, it might work twice as well where you are.

311
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:46,320
So to think about how to draw on the evidence that there is because the the alternative is just to, you know, fly blind.

312
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,930
And that's, again, what's often happening.

313
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:56,910
And there's just a great amount of misallocation of resources and application of interventions that don't necessarily work.

314
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:03,360
And that's what we want to avoid. This idea of looking at the evidence in.

315
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:12,610
And public health more generally came from this, which is not that long ago.

316
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:17,030
I mean, it's whatever now, like 15 years ago only.

317
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:24,649
And it was the it is still a subfield of kind of evidence, review and analysis in public health,

318
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:29,660
in medicine, and it's called small area variation studies.

319
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:35,570
And it started to be where people started to do studies and they would map it and they'd look like this.

320
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:40,580
And so you can see this was one of the the key topics where they'd say,

321
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:46,850
like not just at the state level, but did get down at the county level, even at the hospital level.

322
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:54,350
And you'd see like two or three fold differences in a procedure like caesarean sections.

323
00:31:55,040 --> 00:32:02,149
And you'd say, well, I mean, it was once you get down to small areas, you'd say like, you know,

324
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:08,690
if this was at a small area, you say like, well, that county isn't that different then over here, over the line.

325
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:12,170
But they're doing something at twice the rate that we're doing it.

326
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:15,380
Both answers can't be right. Right?

327
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:21,680
There's got to be like a right in there. Somebody is either doing this too much or not doing it enough.

328
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:28,399
So we need to kind of look at and try to find which is the right answer.

329
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:33,110
That was kind of the motivation for these evidence reviews that started to happen.

330
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:40,280
Here is another example that, you know, opioid prescriptions,

331
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:47,300
they started to look and they would see this is when they started all this concern about opioid and prescription opioid use,

332
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:50,899
that the prescription rate was varying.

333
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:59,300
I mean, just look at the x axis like some places they were just handing them out like candy bars, other places they weren't giving it to anybody.

334
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:04,640
And guess what? It really was associated with opiate death rates.

335
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:08,030
And so this says they're like, gee, we better get a handle on this.

336
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:16,640
There's got to be like a correct amount of opioid that's kind of consist at least and make a recommendation that two places,

337
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:23,270
assuming that the population is the same, there's a you can draw a similar graph in some of our colleagues in the VA,

338
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:32,420
which is a great place to do that because it's a unified health care system across the country where they look at methadone prescription rates.

339
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:41,719
So patients that have an opioid addiction some you really it turns out this that my area of great expertise but then whatever the units

340
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:51,440
are a fairly high heavy dose of methadone is a good thing it keeps people from having the urges that lead them to use like heroin or,

341
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:57,590
you know, illicit drugs that lead to overdoses and dysfunction and all of that.

342
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:06,530
But many providers really don't want to give patients that much because they have this attitude like, well, we're trying to get them off drugs.

343
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:11,270
But if you look so you see this huge variation in how doctors are prescribing methadone.

344
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:19,100
And guess what? Like the relapse rates are much higher in places where the dosing is low.

345
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:29,660
So they started to try to get a handle on this sort of variation and say we have to look at the evidence and really get a better sense of like,

346
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:33,290
what's the right answer in things like,

347
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:40,760
you know, that we're more talking about these brief interventions and you know,

348
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:46,400
it gets down to the level of how many sessions does someone need to make a behavior change?

349
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:50,690
Like do they need to come for five times? Can they do they need to come for ten times?

350
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:56,540
Can you really motivate change in one session? Can you get weight loss after three visits?

351
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:01,129
Should they be talking to a dietician? What are the key characteristics?

352
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:04,700
And again, they're all kind of knowable based on the evidence, unfortunately.

353
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:07,250
And this is the baby out with the bathwater in a certain sense.

354
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:17,600
They're the you know, the medical the medical and public health literature is admittedly very, very imperfect.

355
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:21,530
And so it is. And by the way,

356
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:27,259
like what I said about like there's a lot of great meta analyzes in general that

357
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:31,910
doesn't eliminate the fact that the individual studies are very imperfect.

358
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:39,500
Right. There's some things, as we'll see that, you know, don't get into the literature, frankly.

359
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:45,440
Things are much more likely to get to appear in the medical literature if they're positive studies.

360
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:52,580
So then when people try to do things in the real world, they find that the effects are either null or not as good.

361
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:57,560
Funding matters as we'll see. We'll see a couple quick examples of that.

362
00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:08,930
There are some things that are just not studied as much or not emphasized as much because of, you know, like at least in NIH research,

363
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:17,299
people like me or, you know, other investigators here in the public health school or in the medical school, we decide what we want to research.

364
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,730
It's not no one kind of tells us what to do.

365
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:28,520
And there's kind of a sense of kind of a iterative between us and what the funding agencies are considered particularly interesting right now.

366
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:36,770
And so some things are overemphasized literature and some things are less emphasized in the literature.

367
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:40,820
And we see all these sorts of biases affecting affecting what you see.

368
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:44,480
So this was again, this is like an old, old study, but it's a really good one.

369
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:56,030
What they did was they they had a honestly, a beginning with a topic area was but they were able to identify a a,

370
00:36:56,060 --> 00:37:04,820
you know, a sample of studies that were done in the world in academic centers some.

371
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:13,340
And then then they looked whether they were whether they were presented at a at a professional meeting, whether they were published,

372
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:21,570
or whether neither of those things happened, and how that actually related to what the results of the study was.

373
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:31,250
So what did they find was that of this big sample of actual research studies, the ones that were they found it, they were like dissertation,

374
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:40,249
you know, thesis or you can find like what things and H has funded and they would go and contact those investors and see anything about your study.

375
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:46,520
Did you complete the three hour? We did, but we didn't really get around to presenting the things that were never.

376
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:56,970
Published or presented anywhere, only 29% of them had a statistically significant know intervention effect.

377
00:37:58,210 --> 00:38:03,570
And you can see if they were presented at a meeting, but they never got around to publishing it,

378
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:09,720
they were much more likely to have listed since this is the least significant effect.

379
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:14,940
But then if they were actually presented at a meeting and published, those were much, much more likely.

380
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:19,230
So that's a bias on the part of investigators and on journals.

381
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:27,900
Where journals don't like to publish things gain. We try this brief intervention and it didn't work like well.

382
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:32,900
Maybe you didn't do it right or maybe those things don't.

383
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:35,480
So there is an overemphasis on positive results.

384
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:45,800
We all kind of know that is another thing, you know, that it's kind of intuitively known, you know, that I saw the nose.

385
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:49,710
I almost looked for the study, but I didn't spend too much time today doing it.

386
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:56,069
Apparently there were studies showing that like, you know, sugar consumption doesn't cause people to gain weight.

387
00:38:56,070 --> 00:39:01,080
And they found that was a it was like funded by Coke. Coca Cola was like, okay, fine.

388
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:13,260
But this was a study where they looked in nutrition. I just this small sample of studies and when industry public was finding these studies,

389
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:19,440
guess what all of them had favorable results showing no like and when there was no industry studying.

390
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,640
That's why our NIH is so important. It's supposedly a more neutral.

391
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:30,630
It is. It is more neutral. It's not 100% neutral. There was not it was much more likely to have negative results.

392
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:36,520
So the funding source matters. Sorry, the source of the funding matters.

393
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:40,030
All of these things affect words in the literature, but it's what we got.

394
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:49,090
And as you'll see that when you start looking at these major repositories, four major areas that are kind of at the that aren't at the nuance level,

395
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:57,310
kind of cutting edge research at the level that honestly, that, you know, all of you should be kind of, you know, relying on.

396
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:08,680
There is a lot of good a study. So now I want to talk about the this what we call all these different types of studies that will end up with.

397
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:15,220
Randomized trials and systematic reviews. They can all be thought of.

398
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:21,310
In kind of a consistent hierarchy of the best evidence.

399
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:24,969
And so here's my thought question.

400
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:30,070
So here's this hierarchy of people's opinions.

401
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:35,049
You know, we had a few cases of something, and they get written up like, hey, this.

402
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:43,120
And you will see like so like at the beginning of the COVID epidemic, at the beginning of the HIV AIDS epidemic, like, hey, this is weird.

403
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:46,620
You look at the New England Journal, it's fun to do. Actually, this is what I was doing.

404
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:52,569
You look back, it was like 1980, like. Ten previously.

405
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:55,720
You know, I'm a I'm a physician in San Francisco.

406
00:40:55,780 --> 00:41:00,009
Ten previously healthy gay men, previously healthy young men.

407
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:02,110
And they're coming down with like, you know,

408
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:09,640
these skin cancers that we only see in geriatric patients in Italy and and people that are immune suppressed.

409
00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:14,680
Like, that's weird. That's a case study, you know, so that it's, you know, that's evidence of something.

410
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:23,260
So we have this whole hierarchy of evidence and we can say we'll end up after today probably focusing on these two highest forms of evidence.

411
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:27,520
But there's actually one just that's just just kind of mostly a teaching point.

412
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:34,280
But it really brings together this whole hierarchy and this.

413
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:40,720
And it's a real thing. It's called an end of one study, and anybody know what that is.

414
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:45,340
And in one study like and it's a sample, right? So any one means one patient.

415
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,840
You can't always do it in one studies, but an end of what the study is like.

416
00:41:49,840 --> 00:42:04,240
You have a treatment, say it might be a, you know, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory like so not an opioid, but just like a pain medication.

417
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:07,780
Some are strong and prescribed, some are over-the-counter.

418
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:13,330
And you take one person and say, okay, for three weeks, I want you to use this one.

419
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:16,810
I'm not going to tell you which one it is. Use that. Come back. We'll check your pain.

420
00:42:18,310 --> 00:42:21,580
Don't use the other one. Use that for three weeks.

421
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:26,630
We'll check your pain, then use that first one again. And we'll check your pain.

422
00:42:27,850 --> 00:42:35,919
You might kind of randomly, you know, you know, one, one, two, one, one, one, two, two, two, one.

423
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,700
You know, you get randomly, but you just have the same person. So it's a one person.

424
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:48,220
It's only one person to decide which of those treatments is really better or whether there's any difference at all.

425
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:54,220
So that's only one person. Why would I say that? That's the best kind of evidence.

426
00:42:55,600 --> 00:43:04,670
It's only one person. I don't know.

427
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:11,300
Yeah. Maybe even control for all the other variables in the study.

428
00:43:11,810 --> 00:43:20,630
Yeah. Yeah. Essentially that. That the only thing, you know, we could say the only thing that's different about this.

429
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:30,130
You know, situation, you know, versus that situation is that drug that's there, everything else.

430
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:39,990
In theory is exactly the same the biology of the person there and their behaviors, how physically active they are,

431
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:49,710
their their medication adherence, whether they're actually taking it or how often they're actually all of that is identical in theory.

432
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:57,630
In one of those cases. So you can perfectly compare the outcome in this case in that.

433
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:06,600
Why is that? Like I said, it actually is kind of used to the the the National Health Service in the UK,

434
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:11,220
which takes really I mean, it's a nationally funded public health care system.

435
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:16,830
So they really care a lot about. Misusing treatments.

436
00:44:16,830 --> 00:44:20,400
I mean, because they're like, we had to pay for this. You know, we only want things that really actually work.

437
00:44:20,850 --> 00:44:25,500
They actually really are. Often really push their doctors to do these with patients.

438
00:44:26,490 --> 00:44:32,250
Because they really want to own it. And so, like I said, you can only do that with certain, certain, certain sorts of treatments.

439
00:44:32,290 --> 00:44:35,400
You're often, again, done with like a symptomatic thing.

440
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:39,330
Some things are unethical to do that. Or you can imagine.

441
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:52,320
But but it's the point is that that's that's the perfect all of these to some extent, are progressively better approximations of that.

442
00:44:53,390 --> 00:45:01,160
But we're just trying to compare these two intervention situations or these two treatments.

443
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:06,640
And these all these studies do this. In.

444
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:14,850
A progressively better and better way. That's why that's kind of the ideal in some sense.

445
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:19,160
So these are the course at the bottom of the pyramid.

446
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:25,790
These do it the worse. So, of course, the, you know, here is not even any comparison some of ideas about, you know, how to do treatment.

447
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:32,730
That's a look. And a lot of the guidelines or professional guidelines that we've we used to depend on was providers,

448
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:39,450
doctors usually sitting around and kind of coming up with ideas of how to treatment without any, you know, comparison.

449
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:47,370
And then in these case series or case reports, I'm making this, you know, up.

450
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:50,460
But no, this is this is not far, far off.

451
00:45:50,730 --> 00:45:55,800
But it did kind of come out in in better studies. Hey, I.

452
00:45:57,390 --> 00:46:05,060
I had these these this, you know, these these five previously healthy gay men came in.

453
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:08,640
They had all these weird, very rare cancers.

454
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:14,610
And it turns out that, you know, they were all drug addicts.

455
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:24,760
So there you have it. So it's like no in there just kind of very, very weak ecological studies is when you do it kind of at a population level.

456
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:30,129
So you would compare and this is, you know, like you say,

457
00:46:30,130 --> 00:46:39,040
like what were rates of h of COVID infection in in states or counties that had a very strict masking policy.

458
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:46,269
And once a day. Right. It's just like it's there's without going into detail, there's a lot that's wrong about that.

459
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:53,499
But then like this is more relevant to y'all or to or to like, you know, what you'll hear in public health is cross-sectional study.

460
00:46:53,500 --> 00:47:00,810
So what's a cross-sectional study? A cross section.

461
00:47:04,010 --> 00:47:08,470
Yeah. Yeah, you're really taking the data points have been like $0.01 during that time.

462
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:12,590
Yes, it's a cross. Thanks. It's a it's a cross section of times.

463
00:47:12,590 --> 00:47:18,420
It's like one time point. So a cross sectional study.

464
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:24,780
Of. It's.

465
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:35,299
Students that. Like, Well, this is just like the classic example, again, maybe that alcohol depression,

466
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:41,090
if you did if you did a survey of all of the students in your cohort, probably better to do it bigger than just this class.

467
00:47:41,450 --> 00:47:49,460
So I'd like, you know, answer a bunch of questions to get an idea of how much they drink, how much alcohol they drink, and how depressed they are.

468
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:57,760
Like, I promise you, the ones that drink more, especially they drink more in the extreme rains.

469
00:47:58,790 --> 00:48:02,850
Are going to enjoy smart symptoms of depression, anxiety. Right.

470
00:48:04,850 --> 00:48:17,600
And like I said before, many people and the whole world, the scientific world thought while they bought into this self-medication concept.

471
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:22,950
That said, well, yeah. If you had my life you doing too to, you know,

472
00:48:22,950 --> 00:48:27,840
like people that are drinking more because they're anxious and depressed or they have some biological burden.

473
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:39,570
Turns out there was a there was a very famous researcher at Harvard who did these very long and incredibly long term cohort studies,

474
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:45,120
actually did it of, you know, homeless people in the Boston area and followed them for like 20 years,

475
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:48,540
which is why it was it was incredibly, very difficult to hold these people for that.

476
00:48:49,110 --> 00:48:52,170
And he pretty much debunked that. I mean, there's some of that.

477
00:48:52,620 --> 00:49:00,780
But he says it's not that people drink more because they're depressed, it's that they get depressed and anxious because they drink so much.

478
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:05,759
Like, that's the problem. But you can't know that from a cross sectional study.

479
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:14,309
So there's lots of examples of cross-sectional studies that that have that as a limitation.

480
00:49:14,310 --> 00:49:21,690
And again, we're not going to say like, we can't never we can never pay attention to cross-sectional studies, but they have that is a limitation.

481
00:49:21,690 --> 00:49:23,970
So there's a common, uh,

482
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:36,540
people that you play video games or the other one I'm sure you've heard about violent video games cause kids to be more violent,

483
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:39,690
to act out, to not, not be do as well in school.

484
00:49:39,930 --> 00:49:43,410
And there are often these cross-sectional studies, but like here,

485
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:51,210
you don't know is it that playing video games gives people ADHD, gives them attention problems?

486
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:57,490
Or is it that people that have attention problems are more attracted to spending more time online?

487
00:49:58,890 --> 00:50:02,190
Is that you just you can't know that from across the ocean.

488
00:50:02,190 --> 00:50:07,860
There's no way to know that it is evidence, but it's that limitation.

489
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:15,000
So you're trying to piece out, you know, what is the difference between the ones that are, you know,

490
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:21,360
the intervention here being video use or high amount of video use and low amounts of use?

491
00:50:22,290 --> 00:50:26,009
And, you know, what is it what is that causing in terms of the outcome?

492
00:50:26,010 --> 00:50:32,490
And you just only have one time point. So a time element is really, really critical.

493
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:43,170
It's one element teasing out like sort of the temporal order of things is one of the things that you want to do in this hierarchy is we see does that.

494
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:48,710
Two different levels of success. There's all kinds of funny examples of this, you know,

495
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:56,180
like where they show all kinds of spurious cross-sectional relationships between things that like this goes

496
00:50:56,180 --> 00:51:02,410
up and that goes up in divorce rates go up when bowling and the number of people in bowling these goes down,

497
00:51:02,430 --> 00:51:08,390
you know, all this that you just kind of down. There are a lot of things happen temporally that have nothing to do with either thing.

498
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:15,830
And you can't tell with if there is a causal relationship, you can't tell which direction it kind of goes.

499
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:20,299
Okay, so that's cross-sectional study and that's you're really stuck on the temporal thing.

500
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:24,620
So all these next studies, though, at least fix that.

501
00:51:24,830 --> 00:51:35,930
We're trying to get a handle on the temporal relationship and the next is case control studies and anybody know what that is?

502
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:41,650
I can make a guess and I'm really kind of like, like to just draw this.

503
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:45,830
So I and I don't think everyone can see this.

504
00:51:46,490 --> 00:51:53,240
Yeah. Okay. So you can see I've just got I was going to go to the back with case control study.

505
00:51:55,740 --> 00:52:08,819
Case controls. Yeah. When you take basically patients who were diagnosed with a disease or have half the case and patients

506
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:18,180
who don't have the case and then look at their ask them about their exposures or look at other things.

507
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:21,210
So basically going backwards. Excellent.

508
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:24,420
Thank you. So you have one group of people.

509
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:33,030
Well, I will try and try and make it so you can see that if you have one group of people.

510
00:52:34,910 --> 00:52:41,060
With the conditions and another group of people without the condition.

511
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:45,450
And you say, hey, before you had this condition.

512
00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:52,790
What proportion of them had this particular exposure? That's a case control.

513
00:52:52,940 --> 00:53:00,110
So you're starting to try to. Get that temporal relationship out of the way.

514
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:03,690
That's why it's better than a cross-sectional study. So we fix that.

515
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:09,090
We're trying to get the temporal relations. What might be a limitation of a case control study?

516
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:17,600
Yeah. It's not good for rare exposure.

517
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:21,800
That's exactly true. That's exactly what it is.

518
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:27,829
As we'll see, it's good for rare diseases and it's often used in rare diseases.

519
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:30,830
It's often used in rare condition. Here's a problem.

520
00:53:31,130 --> 00:53:35,890
Here's a couple of examples of where it didn't go well with the case control study.

521
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:39,500
And it's a little it's a better form of those as part of the hierarchy of evidence.

522
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:42,090
There was this feeling,

523
00:53:42,210 --> 00:53:52,430
there's this expectation with some good scientific rationale that when kids were eating more nitrates like meats with nitrates,

524
00:53:52,770 --> 00:54:00,830
like cured meats, like bacon, hot dogs, those sorts of things that that could cause childhood leukemia.

525
00:54:01,610 --> 00:54:05,839
So like you said, that's good. But childhood leukemia is rare.

526
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:19,920
So they got families where the child had leukemia and other families, and they would ask them, hey, by chance, did you eat more processed meats?

527
00:54:19,940 --> 00:54:24,770
And these studies show that. Yeah, they were saying, yes, they did eat more processed meat.

528
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:30,300
So what is here is one of the obvious limitations there.

529
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:39,290
Now, you can maybe see it a little clearer. I'll just say if your kid has childhood leukemia, you know anything about, like, why that might be?

530
00:54:39,290 --> 00:54:42,469
You might think like, yeah, I bet we actually did eat a lot of hot dogs.

531
00:54:42,470 --> 00:54:48,760
You know, you're you're going to knowing that. The disease state of the kid is going to affect the answer.

532
00:54:49,630 --> 00:54:57,780
Right. So that's why it's. You know that in the making that so there might be a reporting bias and it turns out I think that that was true,

533
00:54:57,780 --> 00:55:01,980
that they were kind of just reporting this as a bias.

534
00:55:04,850 --> 00:55:08,690
But you know, like there are certain things, again, if it's particularly rare.

535
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:16,310
Another problem in terms of like if it's ask me about. Behaviors are exposures that the person has to report.

536
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:21,370
If it's something that's deadly, I mean, you don't have all the people that died of it.

537
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:25,040
You only have the one that survived it. So that's another problem.

538
00:55:25,250 --> 00:55:28,910
But then you have that's a case control study. That was one example.

539
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:41,450
Again, in the first studies that were about HIV, AIDS, and we know historical fact that before it was called AIDS.

540
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:47,750
What was it called? It might be. I don't know if you how much you're doing AIDS in your prayer class, you're LGBT.

541
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:52,130
But you know what AIDS was called before it was called HIV AIDS. It's called Grid.

542
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:56,460
Gay related immune deficiency. So again, they were like.

543
00:55:57,630 --> 00:56:05,430
All we know is it seems that many of these people that are having these horrible cannulation of symptoms are gay men.

544
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:14,040
So that was basically to summarize what we know, it's a gay related in some way immune deficiency.

545
00:56:14,490 --> 00:56:18,540
So that was one thing and the other.

546
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:25,170
Sort of limitation is that there was they came up with some very spurious.

547
00:56:27,020 --> 00:56:35,180
Hypothesis. If you look back again the literature it's really it's it's a fun read to look at these studies from the New England Journal of Medicine.

548
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:42,200
There was a hypothesis that that just it seemed that especially early on,

549
00:56:42,770 --> 00:56:54,440
there was a disproportionate number of gay men that had very they had a lot of sexual partners and they were partying a lot.

550
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:58,280
They used a lot of these drugs called poppers, these inhaling drugs.

551
00:56:58,670 --> 00:57:04,850
And so they like, well, there's something about those drugs. It just causes your immune system to crash, you know, something like that.

552
00:57:04,970 --> 00:57:10,460
You know, there's something about that, something about like a lot of exposure to like semen.

553
00:57:10,790 --> 00:57:14,719
They really these were all hype they didn't know. But those are all things.

554
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:20,090
And they did that because they had these samples of people with the disease without disease,

555
00:57:20,090 --> 00:57:22,700
and they were looking for the exposure and they got the wrong answer.

556
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:29,780
But that, you know, when the condition is particularly rare, that's the best you can do.

557
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:37,759
And it's not a bad form of evidence. This was the first this in endeavors to read these there's a couple of these this was the

558
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:43,940
classic first one this is sort of this is this is the groundbreaking paper where they're like,

559
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:51,790
you know. We're stuck. You know, it's so funny to me that you can just imagine this is like 1950 is not that long ago anyway.

560
00:57:52,370 --> 00:58:01,060
Like, we think maybe smoking actually might be have something to do with lung cancer.

561
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:09,020
That was like they no, they didn't know. And this group or it's very neutral they say like well, it might be environmental exposures,

562
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:12,970
but there is another school of thought that it might be all this.

563
00:58:13,130 --> 00:58:21,470
This was cigarets because okay they didn't know it wasn't nailed down and but they were looking at lung cancer happily.

564
00:58:21,470 --> 00:58:27,170
It's a relatively rare condition. And so they had smokers.

565
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:30,860
They had people with lung cancer and without lung cancer.

566
00:58:31,310 --> 00:58:36,620
Interestingly, it wasn't necessarily a home run like it is a patients with lung cancer.

567
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:40,250
How many cigarets a day they were smoking? They were.

568
00:58:42,550 --> 00:58:50,980
They were more likely they'd be smoking more. That was basically like they smoke more interestingly than like I have to look back at it.

569
00:58:51,610 --> 00:59:00,159
They they more almost everyone men and women in this particular we're smoking some people and they're like,

570
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:03,490
look, you look back at these studies, everybody was smoking.

571
00:59:03,910 --> 00:59:09,050
And if they weren't smoking, they were living with a smoker because people there was so much smoker.

572
00:59:09,340 --> 00:59:17,230
So that's why you don't see like it's not this massive association because everybody was exposed even if they weren't a smoker,

573
00:59:17,980 --> 00:59:23,590
they were exposed to smoke anyway. I mean, there was a there was just a lot of smoke if you look back at this paper.

574
00:59:23,890 --> 00:59:27,970
But they did not. So this here.

575
00:59:30,750 --> 00:59:32,660
Would you say? Oh, yeah, yeah.

576
00:59:32,670 --> 00:59:46,350
So women who had lung cancer that was a decent you the group by the disease women's lung cancer the number of who are nonsmokers.

577
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:48,849
Was only 31%.

578
00:59:48,850 --> 00:59:58,990
So 71% of these women, 71% were smokers, meaning 31% were not, which means they all probably were living with one, two or three other smokers.

579
00:59:59,590 --> 01:00:08,710
And of the control patients that didn't have lung cancer, about half of them were smokers that have a I mean, everybody was smoking, but these were.

580
01:00:08,890 --> 01:00:15,360
But the idea is that they they had to define. They were trying to make this association.

581
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:19,680
And so they had to identify people with lung cancer without lung cancer and asked them about their exposure.

582
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:25,440
These and again, we can see we'll talk about the these higher forms of evidence.

583
01:00:27,470 --> 01:00:32,210
But there's certain things again, like you'll never have a randomized trial of smoking.

584
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:40,290
Well, I would say, like and trust me, the tobacco companies, they rode that train to go last.

585
01:00:41,050 --> 01:00:47,090
Like, you don't know if it really is the smoking that's giving them lung cancer.

586
01:00:47,450 --> 01:00:54,170
Maybe people that are have a certain genetic proclivity to lung cancer are more likely to smoke.

587
01:00:55,090 --> 01:00:59,180
You cannot blame that on us. You don't have to show me the randomized trial.

588
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:03,940
They would say that worked for a long time. They're like you. This is just an association.

589
01:01:03,950 --> 01:01:07,519
You can't prove that it's causal. So and that's true.

590
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:15,740
I mean, this is there are certain things that you can't necessarily randomize people to, but it's that form of evidence.

591
01:01:16,220 --> 01:01:21,770
So here we had these two groups defined by the disease and we looked at what proportion had their exposure.

592
01:01:22,370 --> 01:01:29,840
Well, better is when we can flip that around and look forward in time.

593
01:01:30,290 --> 01:01:37,130
So as as we heard, this is a cohort studies which which are better,

594
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:48,899
and that is this where you would have a group of people that have the exposure and you get

595
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:55,970
the people without this exposure and you follow and you see how many of them get sick.

596
01:01:56,710 --> 01:02:04,780
So you can call that group forward in time, make sure they've had the exposure and they don't have the disease that they're there.

597
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:09,080
So you look for incident cases without the disease. Some are exposed, some are not exposed.

598
01:02:09,530 --> 01:02:13,010
And then you can compare the proportion of people that that go into to get sick.

599
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:17,210
That's a better form of evidence. That's a cohort study.

600
01:02:19,710 --> 01:02:22,800
So they're now, again, sort of like what we were saying before.

601
01:02:23,610 --> 01:02:27,200
When the disease is really rare, though, that's really hard.

602
01:02:27,210 --> 01:02:33,820
Like if you're looking at. Say uterine cancer among young women.

603
01:02:34,990 --> 01:02:37,540
That's thankfully something that's very, very rare.

604
01:02:37,570 --> 01:02:46,240
You could have if it's something that happens only once every, you know, like seven cases per 100,000, and you have a study of 500.

605
01:02:46,690 --> 01:02:57,680
You know, you get like 500 women who are eating, you know, nitrates, bacon in cured meats and 500 that or not and follow them for a year or five.

606
01:02:57,710 --> 01:03:01,980
You might not have it. You might not see many cases of diseases. Right.

607
01:03:02,020 --> 01:03:07,960
So it's a limited you can't always do it, but at least you flip that around.

608
01:03:08,060 --> 01:03:11,290
Um. Let's see.

609
01:03:11,950 --> 01:03:17,529
Yeah. So there is. So here's the problem with the cohort study.

610
01:03:17,530 --> 01:03:21,550
This is why it's not the best form of evidence. The better form of evidence.

611
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:26,830
This. I don't know if this was. There's a well, let's see.

612
01:03:26,980 --> 01:03:32,139
There's a lot of studies like this that if this isn't a cohort study and they have some

613
01:03:32,140 --> 01:03:39,219
idea that maybe eating fish is going to be protective against cardiovascular disease.

614
01:03:39,220 --> 01:03:42,430
Fish like salmon. Things like guy breeding. Okay.

615
01:03:42,550 --> 01:03:51,100
That's a reasonable I bother in this study I think was a very very large multiple countries and they kind of establish that that's that is the case.

616
01:03:54,190 --> 01:03:57,760
So what would be the problem? What's the potential?

617
01:03:58,090 --> 01:04:02,800
The main problem with that is that, yeah,

618
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:09,219
you have you're not like in a randomized trial where you can control the behavior of those with the

619
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:16,160
disease and those about another factor of those with like also even though there could be with it,

620
01:04:16,210 --> 01:04:21,190
there's something else. It's not the eating the fish, it's not the salmon.

621
01:04:22,060 --> 01:04:26,580
There's something else about people that eat Sara. Right.

622
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:30,520
So it's not yeah, it's associated with it, but it's not causal.

623
01:04:30,910 --> 01:04:36,940
I mean, I'm half making this up, but I can imagine that, especially if you're you're talking about like Sam and like families.

624
01:04:37,020 --> 01:04:45,280
I'd say it's a relatively expensive food item. Those people are an average higher income or that would be one thing those people on.

625
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:49,690
And so it's not that they're eating salmon, it's that they tend to be eating salmon.

626
01:04:49,690 --> 01:04:56,739
A lot is a marker for being higher income, which has all kinds of great health benefits, including cardiovascular disease.

627
01:04:56,740 --> 01:05:00,340
It's allowing them to they have the money to go to the gym and do other great things.

628
01:05:02,230 --> 01:05:13,600
They the people that eat more salmon are they they they have that belief that eating salmon and they're the kind of people that are,

629
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:15,250
like really worried about their health.

630
01:05:15,610 --> 01:05:23,799
So the fact that they're eating salmon is a marker, that this is the kind of person that is really worried about their health.

631
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:28,209
So it could be another example is using, you know,

632
01:05:28,210 --> 01:05:37,300
pedometer on your phone and tracking your steps leads to lower cardiovascular disease in the future or, you know,

633
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:41,860
that type of person that's obsessively checking their steps on their phone and tracking

634
01:05:41,860 --> 01:05:46,090
the steps every week is doing all kinds of things that we don't necessarily understand,

635
01:05:46,270 --> 01:05:49,540
and that's lowering their cardiovascular disease. So that's the limitation.

636
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:51,610
There's something else because remember,

637
01:05:51,610 --> 01:05:56,979
like at the end of one study that's a perfect there's nothing different about these groups except for that exposure,

638
01:05:56,980 --> 01:06:02,260
that intervention, that drug, the treatment here. We're saying like, we can't say that we didn't.

639
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:06,950
Give people, you know, randomly give them send them in or not.

640
01:06:07,250 --> 01:06:10,370
We there they self-selected in some other way.

641
01:06:11,210 --> 01:06:16,400
Another example of this and this was a great one.

642
01:06:18,650 --> 01:06:23,330
Oh, this was one that just came out and I have my hypothesis.

643
01:06:23,330 --> 01:06:27,290
So this was just came out in British Medical Journal.

644
01:06:27,630 --> 01:06:37,970
Now, you might have heard it on the news that they, you know, getting more boosters is associated with higher COVID rates.

645
01:06:38,150 --> 01:06:42,310
And there's again, there's some sort of like, you know, immunology is very, very complicated.

646
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:51,140
There's some argument to why that could be the case. But I immediately thought of another cohort study limitation that could explain that.

647
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:57,000
That could explain it. What would that be? That you can't rule out.

648
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:03,530
One thought I had was like, You're getting vaccinated a bunch.

649
01:07:03,530 --> 01:07:06,829
You probably only care about protecting yourself and protecting others.

650
01:07:06,830 --> 01:07:10,400
So if you are symptomatic, you might be more likely to test.

651
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:13,280
There you go. That was my that's what I thought.

652
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:19,910
These are people people that are getting more of boosters are very COVID conscious, more COVID conscious for good or bad.

653
01:07:20,210 --> 01:07:24,500
And so if they get any signs that could be COVID, they're going to go get tested.

654
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:27,709
And the other people are like, I got a cold or something. They're not.

655
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:30,800
So it's kind of yeah, there is not.

656
01:07:32,510 --> 01:07:39,280
The boosters. It's a marker for something else about those people that is different and that they're yeah,

657
01:07:39,290 --> 01:07:44,059
there's an observation bias and I think that that I guess I didn't read this particular study,

658
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:48,770
but that was the first thing that that came into my mind when I saw that.

659
01:07:49,670 --> 01:08:04,460
So this is this next one is fun. So the idea is that you really want to say it's that exposure and not just something else.

660
01:08:05,150 --> 01:08:09,560
So there's this whole literature, I mean, you know, 50 years of literature.

661
01:08:09,980 --> 01:08:15,710
So it's showing the association between socioeconomic status.

662
01:08:17,350 --> 01:08:23,050
And health outcomes and life expectancy where people don't live as long.

663
01:08:24,130 --> 01:08:27,760
As people that have more money. So.

664
01:08:29,420 --> 01:08:33,260
You know, you could say, you know, those are all observational studies.

665
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:38,540
And people could say like, well, how do we know it really is their income?

666
01:08:39,620 --> 01:08:45,949
You know, it might be something else about them. And people that have more income, they're probably just they're more educated.

667
01:08:45,950 --> 01:08:52,430
They're more able in other ways, like, you know, is it really income that is causing people to live longer?

668
01:08:52,880 --> 01:09:03,210
So this really very, very interesting, funny, creative researcher from Canada, he did this really amazing study a few years ago.

669
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:09,620
He just did a follow up. It was brilliant because again, he probably did it in an afternoon on his computer.

670
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:13,309
He said, well, how do we disentangle that?

671
01:09:13,310 --> 01:09:21,310
So so we can say. These groups probably aren't different in education or other behavior.

672
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:30,460
They're the same people, except that suddenly one group got tons more opportunity for income than the other group of people.

673
01:09:30,670 --> 01:09:36,940
If we don't have any randomized trials randomizing people to income from something and this is what he did.

674
01:09:37,180 --> 01:09:40,810
He went and you can go online, I guess. And he found.

675
01:09:41,900 --> 01:09:44,930
People that won the Academy Award.

676
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:48,260
And he looked at other people that were up for the award that year.

677
01:09:49,300 --> 01:09:50,440
But didn't win.

678
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:59,600
And so you're saying like winning the Academy Award, according to him, clearly, when you get the Academy Award, that opens all kinds of opportunities.

679
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:04,460
They were getting more movie deals. The salary that they could command got a lot higher.

680
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:07,370
But in fact, he said, like, let's not kid ourselves.

681
01:10:07,820 --> 01:10:14,000
Is that like, you know, actors that it's not they're not actors and actresses because they're brilliant people.

682
01:10:14,270 --> 01:10:19,759
There's not like people that get the Academy Award are necessarily more brilliant or from,

683
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:22,800
you know, a different you know, there's not a lot of constellation.

684
01:10:22,830 --> 01:10:27,350
It's only that this is kind of dropped on them out of this guy pretty randomly.

685
01:10:27,530 --> 01:10:30,020
But then the rest of their life trajectory was different.

686
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:38,910
So you can he looked who won the Academy Award every year and he picked like the people that didn't wear probably match by age and gender.

687
01:10:39,260 --> 01:10:45,470
And then you can see like their their, you know, their death date if they die.

688
01:10:45,830 --> 01:10:54,260
And he found out that his conclusion was that winning the Academy Award add something like 3.5 years to your life was like,

689
01:10:54,740 --> 01:11:00,229
you know, so it was just like one weird example, very creative,

690
01:11:00,230 --> 01:11:12,080
interesting example of using the if tries to struggling with the context of a cohort study and finding a way to actually

691
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:18,920
make the purest possible comparison in this one weird area that supported something that people really want to know about,

692
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:25,219
like what is how is the relationship between income, pure income and life expectancy?

693
01:11:25,220 --> 01:11:28,970
And you shouldn't be winning the academy. He just didn't update like long term survival.

694
01:11:28,970 --> 01:11:33,110
I didn't look what the answer was, but. Yeah, there you go.

695
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:40,800
Okay, so now. We won't get much farther than this today, which is fine.

696
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:49,680
So now you can see with all of those struggles in answering questions about the relationship between an exposure or a

697
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:57,780
drug or a treatment or a negative exposure like tobacco or drinking or opioids or living in a dangerous neighborhood,

698
01:11:57,780 --> 01:12:02,820
or all of the things that we're kind of concerned about in public health, all of those different.

699
01:12:03,810 --> 01:12:07,650
Levels and kind of pitfalls of these observational studies.

700
01:12:07,980 --> 01:12:12,959
We get to the randomized trials. And here's the thing.

701
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:15,750
Like as we here, you got to get the logic a randomized trial,

702
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:22,200
you get the same group of people and they come in and each one, if it's, you know, we want the groups be equal size.

703
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:28,860
You flip a coin or flip a coin, you know, computerized coin and randomly assign them.

704
01:12:29,830 --> 01:12:41,050
To get the thing or to not get the thing, to take the multivitamins or not to eat the salmon or not to smoke cigarets or not,

705
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:49,270
you know, to to do your brief intervention. Or to not do your brief intervention, and you can then follow them.

706
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:57,010
And the here's what's almost underappreciated about the randomized trial.

707
01:12:57,340 --> 01:13:06,100
It's kind of the punchline for why the randomized trial is just to all those other forms of evidence and why it's so highly valued when you can do it.

708
01:13:06,610 --> 01:13:11,439
Every randomized trial that we will look at and that are in the syllabus that you'll

709
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:17,080
look at for your for your group presentations and for your forewords or whatever.

710
01:13:17,530 --> 01:13:22,570
Every randomized trial has essentially this table one.

711
01:13:23,710 --> 01:13:32,920
The table one describes. Here's that people that got randomized to the intervention group, here are the ones that got randomized to that other group,

712
01:13:33,310 --> 01:13:36,690
the ones that got the brief intervention and the ones that did,

713
01:13:36,700 --> 01:13:40,930
they got something else that they got nothing and all the usual care or something and all.

714
01:13:41,260 --> 01:13:46,329
And now we're going to show you that before we did this exposure to them.

715
01:13:46,330 --> 01:13:53,950
But we did before we did the brief intervention to them. We're going to show you we're going to prove to you that the groups essentially are the same.

716
01:13:53,950 --> 01:13:59,350
So this was a study. I don't remember what it was. It's actually I think a drug trial was looking for a big study.

717
01:14:00,370 --> 01:14:07,329
You know, about half median age dementia group, 65.8, 65 points out there.

718
01:14:07,330 --> 01:14:16,450
Right. And that they're same age on average, the proportion that are males, 58%, they're 59%.

719
01:14:16,450 --> 01:14:19,780
They're just as likely to be now in subgroups.

720
01:14:20,890 --> 01:14:27,250
Yes. This is I kind of joke that proportion with diabetes, 15% here, 13% there.

721
01:14:27,610 --> 01:14:30,129
You know, you could say close enough for government work.

722
01:14:30,130 --> 01:14:40,870
They say, you know, systolic blood pressure, 146 in this group, one time I'm in those, the two groups are saying, here's that here's the thing.

723
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:45,050
You know. Yeah. That's what you see in the table.

724
01:14:45,060 --> 01:14:46,080
One of a randomized trial.

725
01:14:46,620 --> 01:15:00,000
The logic, the theory of randomization now says to us that we believe we kind of, you know, statistical theory tells us that these two groups.

726
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:04,600
Are the same and all of the things we're showing in table one.

727
01:15:06,070 --> 01:15:09,970
And also all the other things.

728
01:15:11,030 --> 01:15:14,390
That could predict their likelihood of having that outcome.

729
01:15:15,770 --> 01:15:21,040
Even things we haven't even thought of. That's Mays.

730
01:15:21,050 --> 01:15:24,110
That's what's the most powerful thing about a randomized trial.

731
01:15:24,650 --> 01:15:32,200
It's not just these things. They're the same on average, on average, on everything.

732
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:39,479
That's almost as right. That is an incredibly powerful thing to say that you can't say with any of those

733
01:15:39,480 --> 01:15:46,290
observational studies and gets you kind of close to that idea of like the end of one study.

734
01:15:46,300 --> 01:15:50,550
So that's why randomized trials are so powerful.

735
01:15:50,790 --> 01:16:03,450
So one of the areas where, like I said, we, we that was debunked over just the last three or five years, actually, was this idea of multivitamins.

736
01:16:04,770 --> 01:16:08,040
All the cohort studies were showing multivitamins are good for you.

737
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:11,340
And they really try. I mean, they these people, again, they tried it.

738
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:17,429
We're going to control for statistically for everything they really, really tried.

739
01:16:17,430 --> 01:16:25,500
And they were still showing multivitamins. Actually, they lower your risk of cancer and cardiovascular diseases.

740
01:16:26,550 --> 01:16:34,500
There is a huge ongoing, forever ongoing study, two studies at Harvard.

741
01:16:34,980 --> 01:16:39,540
The ones called the Physicians Health Study once called the Nurses Health Study.

742
01:16:40,140 --> 01:16:45,050
And as you can guess, they basically recruit physicians and nurses around the country.

743
01:16:45,070 --> 01:16:49,590
I think it's the U.S. and they send them surveys, you know,

744
01:16:49,590 --> 01:16:53,910
about their multivitamin use and whether how much physical activity and how much screen time there.

745
01:16:54,090 --> 01:17:00,060
But everything that's really it's kind of a brilliant idea for an observational study for two reasons.

746
01:17:00,090 --> 01:17:04,750
One is that, you know, these are they're sophisticated respondents.

747
01:17:04,770 --> 01:17:10,799
And you can ask them how many, you know, portion sizes of salmon do you eat in an average week?

748
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:15,570
Keep a log for us. And they're sophisticated people, so they will give you very accurate data.

749
01:17:16,590 --> 01:17:21,120
And also, they're just kind of compliance people.

750
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:24,660
So doctors and nurses, they buy. So the response rates are high.

751
01:17:24,930 --> 01:17:26,280
They're these enormous samples.

752
01:17:26,280 --> 01:17:36,960
And a lot of the studies that show if you drink like eight cups of coffee or more, your likelihood of pancreatic cancer goes up by 4%.

753
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:44,430
And they're constantly churning out all these, you know, observational studies and some of those from that study.

754
01:17:44,430 --> 01:17:48,600
Unless we're showing that multivitamins for years the multivitamins were good.

755
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:53,010
But we finally now have this.

756
01:17:53,010 --> 01:18:00,270
And then recently there's been some meta analyzes that they finally did here's

757
01:18:00,270 --> 01:18:05,700
systematic reviews and that has and they just debunked it they said like any so.

758
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:09,890
It ain't so. When you really randomize people.

759
01:18:10,860 --> 01:18:16,679
The results contradict what even the best observational studies can.

760
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:19,980
Disappointing. Yeah, but yeah.

761
01:18:20,430 --> 01:18:23,520
In general, unless someone has some I guess some.

762
01:18:23,670 --> 01:18:32,280
I don't even know if we know this for a fact. But if someone had some severe nutrition malnutrition state, their diet was maybe bad, maybe it works.

763
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:34,620
It turns out that in general.

764
01:18:35,740 --> 01:18:43,889
The millions or billions of dollars that Americans spend their multivitamins according to the best evidence it just sort and there again,

765
01:18:43,890 --> 01:18:55,410
there was some there's been a number of. Instances where the everything that made sense and was shown again and again from

766
01:18:55,410 --> 01:19:02,670
the observational studies turned out to be not true in the randomized trial.

767
01:19:04,140 --> 01:19:11,120
So yeah, we only have one minute left, but and then so then you know, when randomized trials great.

768
01:19:11,220 --> 01:19:18,270
You know, ten or even better. Yeah. And that's where we're going to look at how people in.

769
01:19:18,570 --> 01:19:26,090
The good news is that the way randomized, systematic reviews are presented and summarized and available on these website is very consistent.

770
01:19:26,090 --> 01:19:32,130
So we'll be able to you know, you'll be able to come very literate in how you can kind of read them.

771
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:36,030
And that's a good thing to do that will help with that for next week.

772
01:19:36,390 --> 01:19:52,010
So thanks, guys. And by not.
