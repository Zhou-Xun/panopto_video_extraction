00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,075
Welcome to the epidemiology department of Module Series.

2
00:00:04,075 --> 00:00:09,640
Probability applications in epidemiology part one.

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,264
I'm Miatta Buxton and

4
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:16,940
I am an assistant research scientist in epidemiology department.

5
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:21,907
This unit highlights applications of probability concepts in

6
00:00:21,907 --> 00:00:24,840
the field of epidemiology.

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,288
To get the most out of this video,

8
00:00:27,288 --> 00:00:32,624
I encourage you to view the videos that are listed on the module's page,

9
00:00:32,624 --> 00:00:37,140
which cover background information on probability.

10
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:44,822
Another option is to at least view the math module videos preceding this video.

11
00:00:44,822 --> 00:00:49,622
The objective of this unit is to explore additional

12
00:00:49,622 --> 00:00:53,866
probability scenarios through examples and

13
00:00:53,866 --> 00:00:58,340
connect to concepts in epidemiology.

14
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:02,946
So by the end of this video, you will be able to solve

15
00:01:02,946 --> 00:01:07,773
probability problems that involve determining data

16
00:01:07,773 --> 00:01:12,613
needed to calculate the numerator and denominator.

17
00:01:12,613 --> 00:01:17,776
And then you will be able to apply this type of probability

18
00:01:17,776 --> 00:01:23,940
problem solving skills to situations in epidemiology.

19
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:27,840
Let's take a look at our first example.

20
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,585
A ball is randomly drawn from a box containing 10 red,

21
00:01:33,585 --> 00:01:39,240
30 white, 20 blue and 15 orange balls.

22
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:44,340
What is the probability that the ball is not blue?

23
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:50,766
Returning to the rules of probability that we covered in a previous video,

24
00:01:50,766 --> 00:01:55,940
we need to think about which rule applies in this case.

25
00:01:55,940 --> 00:02:02,245
Since the question is asking for the probability that the ball is not blue,

26
00:02:02,245 --> 00:02:07,940
this means the ball could be read or white orange.

27
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:13,850
Looking at the question this way helps us to decide which rule to use.

28
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:20,940
To solve this problem, we will have to use the addition rule for exclusive events.

29
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:25,532
So the rule is that the probability of A or B or

30
00:02:25,532 --> 00:02:29,380
C is equal to the probability of A plus

31
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:35,140
the probability of B plus the probability of C.

32
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:39,790
As a recap, two events are considered exclusive if

33
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:45,340
both of those events cannot happen at the same time.

34
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:49,949
So an example would be you cannot roll a three and

35
00:02:49,949 --> 00:02:55,740
a four on the same dice at the same time.

36
00:02:55,740 --> 00:03:01,640
So the question is actually asking about exclusive events.

37
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:06,287
So the probability that the ball is not blue,

38
00:03:06,287 --> 00:03:12,040
which means that the ball is red or white or orange.

39
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:17,961
Is the sum of the probability that the ball is red, plus the probability

40
00:03:17,961 --> 00:03:23,401
the ball is white, plus the probability that the ball is orange.

41
00:03:23,401 --> 00:03:27,047
The probability that the ball is red is 10, divided by 75.

42
00:03:27,047 --> 00:03:30,751
10 because we have 10 red balls and

43
00:03:30,751 --> 00:03:34,940
75 because we have a total of 75 balls.

44
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:43,740
So that's 10 red, 30 white, 20 blue and 15 orange balls, so a total of 75 balls.

45
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:48,845
So the probability that the ball is red is

46
00:03:48,845 --> 00:03:55,940
10 over 75, which is equal to 0.13.

47
00:03:55,940 --> 00:04:00,945
The probability that the ball is white is 30 over 75,

48
00:04:00,945 --> 00:04:08,340
30 because we have 30 white balls, and then the total balls we have is 75.

49
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:13,641
So we have the answer being 0.4 and then the probability that

50
00:04:13,641 --> 00:04:21,240
the ball is orange is 15 over 75 which gives us an answer of 0.2.

51
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:26,291
So the probability that the ball is not blue is 0.73,

52
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:31,342
which is the sum of the probability of the ball being red,

53
00:04:31,342 --> 00:04:35,552
plus the probability of the ball being white and

54
00:04:35,552 --> 00:04:41,240
the probability of the ball being orange.

55
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:46,141
The second example is asking, what is the probability of

56
00:04:46,141 --> 00:04:52,040
drawing a queen from a batch of cards that has only face cards?

57
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:56,440
So some background information of what's included in a deck of cards.

58
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:03,640
A deck of cards has four sets, diamonds, hearts, clubs and spades.

59
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,670
Each set has 13 cards.

60
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:11,392
And within each set you have three face cards,

61
00:05:11,392 --> 00:05:15,770
and we're not counting ace as a face card.

62
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:19,740
So we're counting jacks, queens and kings.

63
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:25,740
So with this you have a total of 12 face cards.

64
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:30,707
So revisiting our formula for probability, we have the number of

65
00:05:30,707 --> 00:05:36,940
desired outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.

66
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:41,711
So the probability that you're drawing a queen from a batch

67
00:05:41,711 --> 00:05:45,912
of cards that have only face cards is four over 12,

68
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:52,140
because you have four points and you have a total of 12 face cards.

69
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:56,910
This answer can be further reduced to one over three because then

70
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:58,960
you're dividing by four.

71
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,143
So if you divide four by the numerator, you get one, and

72
00:06:03,143 --> 00:06:07,840
you divide the denominator by four, you get three.

73
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,703
This example illustrates that special attention needs to be

74
00:06:12,703 --> 00:06:15,752
paid to what the question is asking and

75
00:06:15,752 --> 00:06:20,830
which values we select for the numerator and the denominator.

76
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:25,140
So very important to pay close attention to that.

77
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:29,270
So quick recap from the introduction to probability video.

78
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:32,453
We covered that a number of important and

79
00:06:32,453 --> 00:06:37,740
commonly used epidemiologic measures are probability.

80
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:41,230
Examples include cumulative incidents.

81
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:48,491
Other examples include point prevalence and then also period prevalence.

82
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:51,483
And these are just a few examples.

83
00:06:51,483 --> 00:06:56,269
For the remaining slides, we will cover two examples which

84
00:06:56,269 --> 00:07:01,940
highlights applications of probability in epidemiology.

85
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,926
For the first example,

86
00:07:03,926 --> 00:07:09,694
we'll calculate period prevalence using the following scenario.

87
00:07:09,694 --> 00:07:15,204
On January 1st 2020, among 269 residents

88
00:07:15,204 --> 00:07:23,440
at Oak Groves a senior community, 29 residents had diabetes.

89
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:28,576
During the year, 11 new cases of diabetes were diagnosed.

90
00:07:28,576 --> 00:07:33,712
None of the residents died or moved away during the year.

91
00:07:33,712 --> 00:07:38,024
Calculate the period prevalence of diabetes during

92
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:43,440
2020 among residents at Oak Groves.

93
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,389
So looking at the formula for period prevalence,

94
00:07:47,389 --> 00:07:51,807
we have the number of existing and new cases of disease,

95
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:58,940
divided by the number of people in the population during given period.

96
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:05,507
So for our numerator, we know we had 29 assistant cases on January 1st,

97
00:08:05,507 --> 00:08:12,540
and then an additional 11 cases were diagnosed during the year.

98
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:17,340
So this gives us a total of 40 for the numerator.

99
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:22,428
And we have 269 as our denominator because this is

100
00:08:22,428 --> 00:08:27,399
the population that we have given in the question,

101
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:32,539
269 residents at Oak Groves.

102
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:38,140
So based on this, we have a period prevalence of 0.149.

103
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:43,373
And then if you multiply this by 100 you get 14.9%

104
00:08:43,373 --> 00:08:50,440
period prevalence of Diabetes during 2020.

105
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:56,096
For the next example, we are going to use the same scenario

106
00:08:56,096 --> 00:09:00,945
from question three but it's gonna be modified so

107
00:09:00,945 --> 00:09:09,240
that we are going to calculate the period prevalence for only women.

108
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:13,984
The question reads, on January 1, 2020,

109
00:09:13,984 --> 00:09:18,152
among 269 residents, 162 women and

110
00:09:18,152 --> 00:09:26,340
107 men at Oak Groves Senior Community ,29 residents had diabetes.

111
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:31,375
During the year, 11 new cases of diabetes were diagnosed.

112
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:34,996
None of the residents died or moved away.

113
00:09:34,996 --> 00:09:39,860
Of the 29 persons with diabetes On January 1st, 2020,

114
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:44,923
13 were women while 4 of the newly diagnosed cases were women.

115
00:09:44,923 --> 00:09:49,799
Calculate the period prevalence of diabetes during 2020

116
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:53,540
among women at Oak Groves.

117
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:58,555
So revisiting the period prevalence formula, the number of

118
00:09:58,555 --> 00:10:04,280
existing cases plus new cases of disease divided by the population.

119
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:08,540
The number of people in the population during the given period.

120
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:11,040
So period prevalence for women.

121
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,379
We have 13 cases on January 1st, and

122
00:10:14,379 --> 00:10:20,440
then four additional cases, which gives us a total of 17.

123
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:25,028
And then the question gives us the population of women,

124
00:10:25,028 --> 00:10:28,840
a total of 162 women at Oak Groves.

125
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:34,964
So the period prevalence of diabetes is 0.105 or

126
00:10:34,964 --> 00:10:40,140
10.5% during the year 2020.

127
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:44,291
So this example highlights the importance of paying

128
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:48,169
close attention to what the question is asking.

129
00:10:48,169 --> 00:10:53,685
And being able to select key pieces of information needed to determine

130
00:10:53,685 --> 00:10:58,838
what goes into the numerator and what goes into the denominator.

131
00:10:58,838 --> 00:11:05,733
So something to pay close attention to.
