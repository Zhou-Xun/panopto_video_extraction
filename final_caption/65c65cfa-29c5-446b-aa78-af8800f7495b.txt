1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,929
Like the one from Anderson. Yeah. Okay.

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:07,880
We're going to go ahead and get started. Yeah.

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:15,720
Welcome to Public Health. 5000 discussion section, section four to side for the whole semester.

4
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:23,580
So just a little introduction about myself. I'm a second year student in hospital for epidemiology.

5
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,780
I got my undergraduate degree here at Michigan and Biochemistry.

6
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:36,840
My interest includes genetic epidemiology. My current research is with Dr. Alex record, and we look at bacterial biofilms.

7
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:46,409
So specifically, I'm designing a device through 3D printing to explore oral viruses on my post SDH plan.

8
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:52,920
So I want to kind of have a focus on cancer epidemiology and then some fun facts about myself.

9
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,230
I'm actually a quadruplets, so I have a sister, and then I have a unfortunately named one.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,050
I hope that's kind of why you took a stressful Uber with that another day.

11
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:08,800
So then just some general announcements about the class.

12
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:15,300
I know doctors question you hit on this in lecture, but all e-mails should be sent to the public health.

13
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,810
You must email address if you do have an email that's kind of more confidential or personal.

14
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:26,040
You can email the teaching team or Dr. Buxton individually.

15
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,700
All our emails are listed on canvas if you need those.

16
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:37,200
If you have any accommodations and you haven't already sent them to us, please send them to us as soon as possible.

17
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,250
You can send them to US Public Health's email address.

18
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,860
And then, if you are unable to attend discussion section due to illness or any other reason,

19
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,730
please contact us to make arrangements to complete the work outside of class.

20
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:55,319
If you know ahead of time that you are going to miss class, the sooner you can let us know, the better.

21
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,340
And we'll work with you on what you need to make up. Obviously, it's the emergency.

22
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:04,140
Just let us know your circumstances and we'll work with you to make up any work you need.

23
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:09,750
So then just some logistics about this this discussion section.

24
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:17,940
So Sessions are going to provide an opportunity for application of the concepts covered in lectures, site sessions in the prerecorded videos.

25
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:24,989
So we're usually going to do an engaged learning activity that's going to be completed during the discussion section today.

26
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:28,470
We're just going to have a brief discussion so there's nothing you're going to turn in.

27
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:34,320
But usually we're going to do an engaged learning activity that you're going to turn out to canvas once we're done.

28
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:43,079
And then depending on the activity of the class, we'll review the answers after the conclusion of small group discussions and credit will be given

29
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,520
for your active engagement in these discussion activities and that engage learning activities.

30
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:53,760
And then we'll also review answers to the previous week's quiz during the discussion section.

31
00:02:54,060 --> 00:03:00,510
So most of your quizzes are going to be due on Monday, so we'll review that quiz answers in the Thursday discussion section.

32
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:08,040
And then later in the semester, small groups will work on analyzing a research article based on key concepts covered in class.

33
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,790
So that will be what you'll be working on later in the semester.

34
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:19,440
So then just for any details about the quizzes, there's going to be ten questions per quiz.

35
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:23,400
You're going to take the quizzes on canvas outside of class time.

36
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:32,070
Types of questions include multiple choice questions. There are some multiple choice questions that are going to be select all that apply.

37
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:35,160
So you want to make sure you read the directions carefully and you're going to

38
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:39,240
want to make sure you select all the correct answers to get to full credit.

39
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:45,270
There's also going to be some questions where you select from a dropdown list of options, true or false?

40
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:52,740
Right. And short answer and calculations for some questions, and then you're only allowed to take each quiz once.

41
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:59,040
So I think you mean it's designed in a way you can take it and you can kind of come back to it,

42
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:05,790
but just make sure you submit it and you can always submit it once and then you can collaborate with your peers.

43
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:13,560
On these quizzes. We ask that you please don't just copy answers from another person, so we can't really monitor that.

44
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:20,070
But these quizzes are good practice for the exams and making sure you actually know the material.

45
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:23,550
So we do encourage collaboration between individuals though.

46
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:29,790
Are there any questions or just sticks about discussion or the quizzes or anything for the class?

47
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:37,570
Okay. So then next, we're going to go over some guidelines for classroom discussion.

48
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:42,850
So we ask that you share responsibility for putting all the voices in the conversation.

49
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:47,740
If you tend to have a lot to say, make sure you leave sufficient space to hear others.

50
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:53,710
If you tend to stay quiet in group discussions, challenge yourself to contribute so others can learn from you.

51
00:04:54,640 --> 00:05:02,890
Just that you listen respectfully. Don't trust, turn to technology or engage in private conversations while others are speaking.

52
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:11,110
Use attentive, courteous body language comments that make you that you make when they're asking for clarification,

53
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:16,990
sharing critiques, or expanding on a point to reflect that you have paid attention to the previous speakers comments.

54
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:22,030
We ask that you're open to changing our perspectives based on what you learn from others.

55
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:25,120
Try to explore new ideas and possibilities.

56
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:33,520
Think critically about the factors that have shaped your perspectives and seriously consider points of view that differ from your current thinking.

57
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:44,710
We ask that you understand that we are bound to make mistakes in this space, as anyone does when approaching complex tasks or learning new skills.

58
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:49,480
Strive to see your mistakes and others as valuable elements in the learning process.

59
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:54,190
Understand that your words have effects and others speak with care.

60
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,110
If you learn that something that you've said was experienced is disrespectful or marginalizing,

61
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:02,290
listen carefully and try to understand that perspective.

62
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:08,140
Learn how you can do better in the future and then take care of the small group work seriously.

63
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,550
Remember that your peers learning is partly dependent upon your engagement as well.

64
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:19,060
And lastly, understand that others will come to these discussions with different experiences from yours.

65
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:24,280
Be careful about assumptions and generalizations you make based only on your own experience.

66
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:30,820
The open to hearing and learning from other perspectives. Make an effort to get to know other students.

67
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:36,550
Introduce yourself to students in your group or refer to classmates by name when possible.

68
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:41,860
So a lot of times we're going to break into small groups so you can try and kind of work with different

69
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:47,530
people that would be good and then understand that there are different approaches to solving problems.

70
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:53,050
If you are uncertain about someone else's approach, ask questions to explore areas of uncertainty.

71
00:06:53,590 --> 00:07:02,900
Listen respectfully to how and why their approach could work. So then based on this, some of you might have seen this model before, the iceberg model,

72
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:10,520
but you're just showing that a person's identity, only a small fraction of who they are, is actually visible.

73
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:18,230
A lot of who they are is going to be under that is going to be invisible under that line of visibility.

74
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:21,830
So just be respectful when we're in these group discussions.

75
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,630
So then now that I've told you a little bit about me and the course,

76
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,680
we just are going to ask you to take a quick about five minute survey just about yourself so the teaching team

77
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:41,880
can get to know you and anything you might want us to know about you so that we should be posted in the slides.

78
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:47,310
Let me know that trouble accessing it and I'll get about 5 minutes to complete.

79
00:08:44,430 --> 00:12:55,050
Yeah. I like.

80
00:13:01,630 --> 00:14:22,470
Totally. HI, Mr.

81
00:14:41,950 --> 00:15:22,480
Still. Is everyone about finished or do you need more time?

82
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:37,330
Okay. So here's some graphs. So it looks like majority, 32% of you are.

83
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:51,530
31% of you were undergraduate, 25% hp h e 2520 2% HP and then 22% bio stats.

84
00:15:51,560 --> 00:16:03,740
We have a good writing departments here and then it looks like 28% of you are first year students, about 16% second year.

85
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:11,300
And then we have undergraduates, juniors and seniors and then some MHC students.

86
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,740
So now we're going to get into our group activity for today.

87
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,070
So we're going to look at epidemiology and the popular press.

88
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,820
So just some examples here, some examples of headline news from different variants.

89
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:40,090
So all of these articles are focusing on COVID 19 and masking to prevent COVID 19, but they're all kind of written at different dates.

90
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:43,810
So the step one here is October 2020.

91
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:50,800
We have January 2023, December 2022, and then June 2020.

92
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:56,410
So they're all kind of written at different times, but they're all focusing on the same news.

93
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:03,610
So for today's small group discussion, I'm going to have you guys break into small groups.

94
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:09,999
If you could just introduce yourself to your group so your interest in post speech

95
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,770
plans and then designate one member of your group as the spokesperson for your group.

96
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:21,399
So you guys are going to have about 25 minutes and your small groups, maybe a little less if you're done before that.

97
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:26,350
And then we'll reconvene as a large group and you can share out what you've talked about in your small groups

98
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:34,690
and then the questions you all are going to focus on are these where do people get their public health news?

99
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:38,230
What are the advantages and disadvantages of their sources?

100
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:45,710
Should we be concerned about information overload? How should we address conflicting information and any situations?

101
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:48,280
What is my role as a public health professional?

102
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:57,670
If you want to bring your own lens and perspective so you can kind of break off however you want into your small groups,

103
00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:05,860
and then you can go ahead and start discussing this. No, there's not anything to do afterwards.

104
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:10,450
So you can kind of you don't you don't formally branch out or anything, but.

105
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:19,329
Oh, yeah, that's right.

106
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:25,780
That's cool. I guess so.

107
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:31,420
And it seems like everyone's what is amazing.

108
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:46,930
MARGARET I'm also a second year MHC and activist, and we need to go back to the U.S.

109
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:58,810
This is an area I'm also the second year in a row.

110
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:15,740
Yeah, well, you haven't got a lot of time in my life.

111
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:27,520
I think that's local politics, but I think that's hard.

112
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:46,940
I think it's just like, you know, it's especially I mean, after years of research and decide what we are going to go, that's exciting.

113
00:19:51,400 --> 00:20:15,000
Yeah, it's probably awesome, but I don't like to watch TV, but I'm also very quiet through conversation and things like that because.

114
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:20,200
Like something like that. Yeah, I know.

115
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:30,100
But yeah, I thought I'd like to know.

116
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:34,280
Yeah, yeah. Oh so much.

117
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:38,830
I think it's like that differs from news outlet.

118
00:20:39,610 --> 00:21:03,890
So I do think it's probably the same topic since I first started.

119
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:10,060
Sounds very exciting. Yeah, that's true.

120
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:23,200
So someone I can manage this study, something that I just can't say.

121
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:32,330
I mean. Right?

122
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:54,510
Right. Is there any way we can use it to get everybody out there?

123
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:26,219
Yes. I used to be like my brother, but it was just about like.

124
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:30,270
It's not like. That's right.

125
00:22:33,900 --> 00:23:04,890
This is kind of like, you know, like the other extreme is like scientific know.

126
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:10,630
It's like here's what I mean.

127
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:31,930
I agree that it's like I think what I got him, I was like, this is supposed to work.

128
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:38,010
And I don't think that is it transparently.

129
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:47,610
It's okay. It's just like.

130
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:56,810
Yeah, I think I'm just saying.

131
00:23:57,070 --> 00:24:01,559
I think maybe I'm like, but I, I mean, I think it makes sense,

132
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:19,400
but I think that's what I would say because I think there is going to be a sort of the same sense for the season,

133
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:31,380
or at least the next question is pretty much else like, what do you do to help?

134
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:44,700
Right. Yeah, I don't agree. I recently become still by the government sometimes, you know, the president,

135
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:52,250
you can't just like smile old because then it's like, you know, that's a really small sample size.

136
00:24:52,730 --> 00:25:00,900
You can't talk about that or I used to like the topic.

137
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:14,770
I think that's part of how do you write everything from everything you put into my work?

138
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:27,810
Just like I always look for something, you know, just because it makes you feel like you're a little bit surprised how much you know.

139
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:37,040
So my undergraduate, you have taken a different life.

140
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:43,709
Yeah, I'm going to be like, Yeah, I don't think that they don't touch another.

141
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:57,830
And she will be like, It's really cool. I could not do sources like things like that, cause standing up is accurate.

142
00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:27,190
It's like, Hey, I'm not thinking seriously about how good she has and if there's more consistency.

143
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:34,060
Yeah, right. I'm like, looking out. Simply be credible.

144
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:44,790
I don't want you going to SoulCycle. Oh, Christ.

145
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:53,570
Yeah, I know. I like that.

146
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:58,310
Oh, I just wanted to hands.

147
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:04,720
Know what? We're going to dinner tonight. I like class, so it's often that.

148
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:11,420
You know what I mean?

149
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:18,040
I mean, everybody and everybody. I think I was calling her name.

150
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:33,890
Oh, yeah, I guess my name is Mark holding out for too much because I got to do things like this and my career,

151
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:45,070
and I just always got it in my class here. You say something like that, you know, and it's like.

152
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:51,879
Which I mean, it's like Little Caesars.

153
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:57,990
Like, all this is really just that.

154
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:10,840
I was like, really? This sounds it's like, I don't know the answer to this one.

155
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:27,640
And it's definitely a start to feature. Like, what exactly are the other options that an American somebody wants?

156
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:42,090
But it's like, you know, somebody who's really great or something.

157
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:51,420
You have to realize that you're still being interviewed, that or somebody.

158
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:59,740
Yeah, yeah. To say I think that's a good point.

159
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:12,980
So I think this is I think it was the classic excuse me and this was a while ago.

160
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:18,579
I know so much about it. I know that because they're like, you know what?

161
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:38,020
They know? They just like there needs to be kind of like I said on Monday, here's what they're like.

162
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:42,100
So I don't know what think we're going to get rid of.

163
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:51,220
Let me know how that works. They do, I think, a great deal of.

164
00:29:54,450 --> 00:30:19,430
I think it's one more survey in the wrong place at the wrong time.

165
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:34,580
The problem is, I mean, as you can see afterwards, brands are simply trying to get out here.

166
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:43,250
It's a little like pushing them if they can't get it right.

167
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:52,160
Otherwise, that's the bottom line is I will see these people run off.

168
00:30:53,510 --> 00:31:05,180
So this is really you know, I just think it just like you have people with me who are really on this.

169
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:12,830
Let's story. That's what they said. And it's part of reducing their population, trying to help those people.

170
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:17,860
But it's not very long suffering type words. So I think it's really cool.

171
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:35,670
Just go back and check out these people. There are far more attention grabbing that there's always next questions relaxed relation

172
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:56,660
to various pictures myself in a really good time that we do in our work around the country.

173
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:05,660
So you ride it out of this anger, even though it's not the other way around.

174
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:09,080
Well, there's so many millions.

175
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:27,080
I always and there are just all these parts of the topic right in there and just watching it ought of people like probably something like this.

176
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:34,410
But I think probably we don't have a choice. Yeah, I wasn't going to go to what I'm saying.

177
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:45,920
I feel like you're like a little bit like several streets behind it.

178
00:32:45,950 --> 00:33:00,080
There wasn't enough. And that's how, you know, sometimes was like, that's one of the things that I was like, you know what?

179
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:07,540
This is what I was supposed to be able to take.

180
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:17,030
I had and all these roads under construction, as had known in that way.

181
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:24,440
But it was like, you know, I want to do this.

182
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:40,190
I want to make sure that you don't really know what this is all going to focus on TV.

183
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:54,560
Yes, we're in love with it. That's why I got to 900.

184
00:33:56,690 --> 00:34:04,450
But I they had in July this week about five months old.

185
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:17,680
So that's why I remember. It will also be like, this is what we've got.

186
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:31,120
You know, they don't represent they just think that this is expensive stuff.

187
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:51,970
I know it's going to take some time in the history of the world I to watch the girl.

188
00:34:54,390 --> 00:35:12,450
They were out there on tomorrow morning and now we are over there and like and, you know, I work with someone I like.

189
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:21,010
So I think it's very difficult for these guys.

190
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:26,660
I was like, What am I going to do?

191
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:32,180
Oh, I think it was one of the famous friends.

192
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:45,660
And I was like, you know, I don't remember what that's like.

193
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:57,410
I don't know. What are you thinking? Like she's going to be, like, in a state of his life since I was five years old.

194
00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:04,910
It was like, we want to be like, just think this is a huge problem.

195
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:08,840
And that it was like, you know what?

196
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:12,570
I was like, really?

197
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:30,610
So we just got like an hour and a half. I think it's strange that nobody wants to know that much about it, but yeah, I guess not.

198
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:37,860
Yeah, I think, well, I think everyone will hear it.

199
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:41,990
And he was like, This is nice.

200
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:46,510
I mean, I don't know.

201
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:57,530
I don't think so. I know you're not going to dress in French around you.

202
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:01,040
I was trying to say.

203
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:07,970
Oh, yeah. Was like, I did see that red dress.

204
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:16,990
Really? It was like most interesting things.

205
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:20,940
First Associate Director. Yeah, yeah.

206
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:26,030
I mean, she's really nice.

207
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:35,130
I think these things changed so much talking to me about like.

208
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:57,209
Like there was. I wasn't that high. And she was trying to interact, which is what I was saying, you know, to like to try.

209
00:37:57,210 --> 00:38:05,600
Well, it's only strategy. You have to like when she was okay since like that sort of example,

210
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:16,540
she's certainly not missing out on a clear concept because I think I was just like,

211
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:31,340
do you just say, for example, like, I had never seen anything like that.

212
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:39,379
I was like, Oh, this is engagement.

213
00:38:39,380 --> 00:39:09,510
And would you have to know this is why you want me to wait and wait for the conversation in science fair fight.

214
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:25,490
So it's. Definitely when I was 15 and it turns out it's not safe for my team member to let her out.

215
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:42,970
I see it now with public. And so I just learned so much about care attention away from somebody, so understanding of someone.

216
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:48,220
And when they come from.

217
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:52,510
I thought it was hard for you to say I.

218
00:39:58,590 --> 00:40:05,940
You have taken the last few years. It's really nice to meet you.

219
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:17,430
You know, I've read the articles used in factories that I don't like to bother you.

220
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:27,900
When I was like, every Sunday, she's like, it's like an undergrad.

221
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:36,090
Just like, it's really easy to make sure you want to make sure you get some.

222
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:52,560
I'm not you're not going to you know, I'm not going to get to do it again to ask that that's how you get to the states.

223
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:56,000
It's interesting. I hate to think place.

224
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:06,420
Is everyone ready to come back as a large group? Do you need more time in your small groups or you have a little harder or something in your position?

225
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:43,140
So it sounds like she's here, obviously, because I'm don't sure say, you know what, you're asking you guys to do three camps and you mentioned this.

226
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:56,969
I know this. $10,000 for fast paced course capacity.

227
00:41:56,970 --> 00:42:07,050
Yeah. For this this course thing, which looks like you're going to be in such a small town.

228
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:18,760
How about Businessweek? Anderson's not responsive for that.

229
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:24,720
I am so sorry.

230
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:34,670
Actually, it's how often naturally. As opposed to what are you doing?

231
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:46,860
Oh, it is really interesting. So if something's not right and not enough discussion between everybody was going to be, like, across the globe.

232
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:54,180
So in other words, how do you guys. Oh, just write something I don't like.

233
00:42:55,110 --> 00:43:08,820
Or if you did what you see, what doesn't work so that anything you want to write, you choose to the last question.

234
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:16,220
What's your role in specific? As long as there's nothing wrong.

235
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:22,980
I just want us to look at, like, different solutions.

236
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:31,290
Like it's just a laundry list of things.

237
00:43:31,290 --> 00:43:35,490
Different things you want us to see should be enhanced.

238
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:42,189
Oh, my gosh. What are all the other things they want to see?

239
00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:44,880
Different models. Oh, it's really cool.

240
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:56,050
I want to take over only six months from inflation and I think rush hour and then the presentation of what else is doing.

241
00:43:56,120 --> 00:44:23,350
Can we do that without also trying to find resources to support your questions and a lot of data over the summer?

242
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:45,520
I guess for everything too, because, you know, sometimes you can especially say, yeah, nations aren't because it was a great year.

243
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:52,170
I thought I closed my eyes. I was just.

244
00:44:55,270 --> 00:45:07,510
As you said, it's not three, six, seven guitar like she's in Chicago.

245
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:19,450
I like the way she is, for fact.

246
00:45:20,290 --> 00:45:29,920
I think it's interesting since you were inspired by global climate change,

247
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:51,280
but we're also talking about expanding not only transit policy and then also when you are in New Orleans.

248
00:45:51,430 --> 00:45:58,570
Yes, I think I have Nimitz class right now.

249
00:45:58,930 --> 00:46:08,690
So there are different types of audiences.

250
00:46:09,270 --> 00:46:25,310
So it's nice to see how you see it as a place that everybody told me a secret about three or more vending machines on Baton Rouge.

251
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,500
It's not at all. Why is that?

252
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:46,760
You're going to have a little story and you actually think a lot of things are going to happen.

253
00:46:50,650 --> 00:47:07,310
I was just starting to see which because I ran out of time to be in a kitchen where he just sat out front.

254
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:13,630
I want to repeat, like, I'm so glad that I want addiction.

255
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:19,870
Okay. So we have a question for you.

256
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:38,520
You know, I guess I just wonder what you think of Ziglar literally working with 35, 39 people work and do your job.

257
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:51,140
I was like, you know, and I'm like, these people deserve to know that this is actually what you to do.

258
00:47:51,220 --> 00:48:02,200
Not exactly right. Let's see how that came about.

259
00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:15,040
This is the way, you know, I like this idea that businesses this way, like they ask me to do that.

260
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:28,480
You know, I was just, you know, I wanted to say thank you for helping me out.

261
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:43,990
What did she say? This is your you're that she wants you to know that.

262
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:50,110
I think whatever your background is, we're the.

263
00:48:52,870 --> 00:49:01,279
So it's good to see you have offices in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.

264
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:04,639
My department was busy. I think we're going to go ahead.

265
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:07,760
And it's a large program. Yeah.

266
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:13,700
So we're going to start with the first two because the first two are kind of related.

267
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:19,310
Where do people get their public health news and what are the advantages and disadvantages of their sources?

268
00:49:19,850 --> 00:49:24,330
So does any group want to start? Any ideas?

269
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:30,260
Do I need one of those or can people hear me? Speak up.

270
00:49:30,490 --> 00:49:38,110
Everyone good? Okay, I can hear you. I talked about how a lot of us use Tik Tok to get our news, which is not necessarily the most reliable,

271
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:42,490
but it does have a lot of current events that are shown on it.

272
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:48,459
And so again, one of those disadvantages would be that it's not always reliable and that sometimes people

273
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:53,020
who aren't exactly qualified to speak are talking about topics that they offer to me.

274
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:58,000
But at this hour, an advantage is, is that it reaches a lot of people.

275
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:05,140
And there are a lot of different perspectives that you can see and learn about and different events.

276
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:16,260
So, yeah. And we talked about similar stuff, a lot of things through social media and there's Tik Tok or Instagram or Facebook or Twitter.

277
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:24,240
And it's awesome because it reaches a lot of people and it's very easy to get like you can just hop online to something new every day.

278
00:50:24,570 --> 00:50:30,059
But a huge disadvantage is that a lot of times the stuff that you're getting is very tailored to you.

279
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:36,310
So like you can look at one article from a certain point of view and then whatever algorithm is working,

280
00:50:36,310 --> 00:50:43,060
we'll keep feeding you stuff with that point of view. And the same thing kind of goes for like actual news media.

281
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:48,750
Like you can look at Fox News versus New York Times and you're going to very different point of view on the same issue.

282
00:50:49,110 --> 00:50:53,519
And a huge disadvantage of that is that you probably have to keep reading the stuff that you

283
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:58,200
like to hear or that you have and that that kind of cuts you out from different places.

284
00:50:59,370 --> 00:51:05,910
So then do you think it's important to kind of the different sources to see the different perspectives there?

285
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:12,180
Yeah, I think I don't think you have to agree with everything you read, but I think it's important to reach different points of view.

286
00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:17,250
And we also talk we talk about this as well.

287
00:51:17,670 --> 00:51:28,139
And we talked about getting it from people that you know personally and any example like a group chat where people are send information which is

288
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:36,420
helpful and not it's just a it comes directly to you don't have to seek it out but that of course you don't you're not checking in the same way.

289
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:40,570
It's easy for misinformation to spread that way. Yeah, I think that's a good one.

290
00:51:41,010 --> 00:51:46,680
I don't know about you all went through other classes. I've had classes where we kind of do like hot topics,

291
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:52,799
where we kind of if there's anything in the news someone sees that they think is interesting related to public health, we get that.

292
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:57,690
So that's kind of along those lines, too. But just getting your information, people around you.

293
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:12,030
Any other ideas? I'm just adding on to my set about getting information from trusted people.

294
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:22,980
It's nice. It's an advantage because the sources are preventing any kind of drug abuse or, you know, who's funding the source of that.

295
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:31,260
You know, where what is this website? Because if it can become really convoluted, all the different news sources and how they're connected.

296
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:38,310
We did talk about generational gaps, all this. Yeah.

297
00:52:38,310 --> 00:52:41,040
I mean, it's just funny, like talking about tick tock.

298
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:45,450
Like my mom has never been on tick tock in her life, but she spends like 3 hours a day on Facebook.

299
00:52:45,930 --> 00:52:51,180
So like, people obviously, like depending on who you are, like have very different sources that they're drawing upon.

300
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:58,829
And so like the idea just being, you know, we we is kind of getting down to the last question early,

301
00:52:58,830 --> 00:53:03,569
but like we as public health professionals have this obligation to kind of make sure we're even

302
00:53:03,570 --> 00:53:08,540
just kind of subtly advising people to be wary of the perspective that they're taking in.

303
00:53:09,510 --> 00:53:13,590
I didn't like any other ideas for the first two.

304
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:22,160
Okay. We can move on to the third question. So should we be concerned about information overload?

305
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:34,070
Yes, I think it's definitely a fair concern to have because there are like where people are getting their sources,

306
00:53:34,430 --> 00:53:38,180
who's who are they talking about it with? Like all all that matters.

307
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:44,660
And it's hardly a negative thing to have tailored news to be told, like, oh, here's something that you like.

308
00:53:45,470 --> 00:53:54,560
But at the same time, like, it's kind of I think it's kind of important to have information provided at the level people can understand it,

309
00:53:54,980 --> 00:54:00,740
because if information is given in a way that isn't understandable, what's the point of it?

310
00:54:00,970 --> 00:54:10,070
Yeah. So I think like there has to be a fine line and when there's a sense like news and social media drug with competition,

311
00:54:10,550 --> 00:54:17,150
it's kind of hard to figure out how do we work what's best for people instead of what's best for profit?

312
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:26,220
Because I think that's an area. So can we get that question three and four?

313
00:54:26,230 --> 00:54:29,830
I think when there's too much information, people can get overwhelmed.

314
00:54:30,070 --> 00:54:34,780
And B, the information can again get misconstrued or misinterpreted in so many different ways.

315
00:54:35,170 --> 00:54:42,700
So then to kind of address conflicting information, I think it's really important for us to kind of have a neutral perspective and again,

316
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:48,669
listen to everyone's unique perspectives and then to be able to explain the science in a way that people will understand it.

317
00:54:48,670 --> 00:54:54,370
So instead of just throwing out terms that no one will understand, like rephrasing and synthesizing,

318
00:54:54,370 --> 00:55:03,010
so that everything is in layman's terms, everyone can understand it. Any other ideas about this one?

319
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,540
Just kind of dropping off a few points on it.

320
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:11,229
Like information overload tends to lead to atmosphere in a lot of places.

321
00:55:11,230 --> 00:55:16,480
And I think that's really dangerous because you don't ever really have the

322
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:22,330
ability to reflect on things super important that are going on in the world.

323
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:32,070
And it becomes impossible to actually like distill all of the amount of information into, you know, the important.

324
00:55:32,410 --> 00:55:37,230
I mean, so. We should be.

325
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:41,610
Yeah. Do you think there's a difference, then, with, like, misinformation?

326
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:46,350
Like, I'm tired of getting overloaded with all this information.

327
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:50,730
Are you, like, you distinguish between what's actually reliable and what's not?

328
00:55:55,620 --> 00:56:07,170
So then how should we address conflicting information? Ideas.

329
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:17,000
Yeah. So a lot of times if you tell people they're wrong, their immediate reaction is to just kind of hole up and dig in further.

330
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:24,910
So, so generally just like, say, you know, what you're saying is wrong is not the best strategy to go about it.

331
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:28,760
It's much more to kind of ask them where they're the place that they're coming from.

332
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:33,650
And so maybe they do have good intentions, like we talked a little bit about like the ivermectin.

333
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:38,870
Like, I'm sure a lot of those people like really thought they were trying to be helpful to people that they knew,

334
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:44,420
but just the information that they were working with was incorrect. So like, hey, I really appreciate where you're coming from.

335
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:50,360
Maybe let's have a conversation about like, here is here is what we know, here's what we don't know.

336
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:56,569
And just kind of taking an approach on it that's much more subtle than just outright saying, you're wrong, this is right.

337
00:56:56,570 --> 00:57:00,229
I'm going to tell you because I'm X.

338
00:57:00,230 --> 00:57:09,830
You know, we discussed that the audience is kind of on that audience member to do your

339
00:57:09,830 --> 00:57:15,379
own research and then pay attention to what the different sources are like.

340
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:17,510
So if the CDC is saying something different,

341
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:26,630
probably the White House puts out like how are those like either the same or different over they getting that information from.

342
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:29,400
Yeah. So it's kind of the responsibility of the person.

343
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:38,570
Do you think it's also the responsibility then of like, say, the CDC and White House working together that they don't always do anything about it?

344
00:57:41,190 --> 00:57:47,110
On this one. I saw them in the last one.

345
00:57:47,110 --> 00:57:51,670
In these situations, what is the role what is your role as a public health professional?

346
00:58:04,090 --> 00:58:09,209
We talked to him about this is a generic, but like in any public health discipline,

347
00:58:09,210 --> 00:58:14,910
whether it's biology or GP or stats governance, we focus on evidence.

348
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:21,290
It's really important for us to bring evidence into the situation, and that could be useful when you're covering.

349
00:58:21,730 --> 00:58:25,950
If you do like this evidence, what's your evidence of that?

350
00:58:29,780 --> 00:58:35,050
You know, if you are bringing in evidence, sure is evidence that people can actually understand.

351
00:58:35,530 --> 00:58:41,800
It doesn't help to bring in a ton of stuff directly from statistics that no one

352
00:58:42,130 --> 00:58:46,900
outside of a math or science background would be able to appropriately interpret.

353
00:58:53,830 --> 00:59:01,000
We also need to advocate for information sharing in these ways as public health professionals.

354
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:07,030
It is totally in our realm and in our discipline to advocate for plain language.

355
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:11,140
These are kind of historically ignored aspects of public health.

356
00:59:12,970 --> 00:59:25,180
So that's important. Maybe not like your sole purpose public health professionals, but it should definitely be part of your job.

357
00:59:27,430 --> 00:59:31,600
I'm also being respectful of the person you're talking to and not dismissive of

358
00:59:32,470 --> 00:59:35,830
what they think or a lot of the information that they were getting from someone

359
00:59:35,830 --> 00:59:40,930
else and making sure that the information provided is culturally responsive

360
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:50,140
and being aware of your conditionality and you have the best ideas about any.

361
00:59:55,740 --> 00:59:59,580
Does anyone have any questions about the class in general before we end today?

362
01:00:01,670 --> 01:00:09,830
So it's not like I'm at least on the syllabus or can recite one of the exams and I'd appreciate if I could see like the same types of things.

363
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:18,450
Okay. Yeah. I mean, not too sure. And I'll pass the time and go make sure, you know, like some examples.

364
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:24,140
Thank you. You mentioned that we would work on engaged learnings here.

365
01:00:24,170 --> 01:00:32,690
Is that equivalent to problem sets in canvas or are those two different, slightly different engaged learning activities?

366
01:00:32,690 --> 01:00:37,480
We're going to do a discussion and then we'll send them in after each discussion, after we present.

367
01:00:37,820 --> 01:00:44,540
Your problem sets are going to be separate. They're kind of like homeworks or you go through problems related to that material.

368
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:50,690
We just cover it and you'll turn those in. Okay, so we'll have quizzes, problem sets, engage learnings and exams.

369
01:00:51,260 --> 01:00:55,970
Okay. And the Engage learnings will be submitted on canvas.

370
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:59,719
Yeah. Okay. So like today we just had this discussion.

371
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:03,890
So you don't have anything to submit for? Like next week, we'll have an engaged learning activity that.

372
01:01:04,340 --> 01:01:10,940
What do you think you'll submit afterwards? Okay. Okay. Thanks. Any questions?

373
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:16,670
If not, that's all for today and next week.

374
01:01:17,490 --> 01:01:26,820
Thank you. Thank you. Sorry.

375
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:42,760
Margaret, I like this. You're going to get the best out of him at some point.

376
01:01:45,330 --> 01:01:48,790
I started even.

377
01:01:51,580 --> 01:01:52,960
She never answered my e-mail.
