1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:16,770
So the next type of design to talk about is restriction, just like our analytic approach of stratification.

2
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:23,850
What we do with restriction is we limit participation to only those in one category of a confounder.

3
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:29,520
So let's take our example of different drugs predicting cardiovascular events.

4
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:36,450
If we restricted our population to only those who had a family history of disease,

5
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:47,640
we might be likely to take out any of the extra information that a physician might have in prescribing the drug, because now everyone is high risk.

6
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:55,980
So risk really shouldn't be predictive of whether or not the physician prescribed somebody An A or B versus an ACE inhibitor.

7
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:03,930
So one of the issues with restriction is that there's rarely only one confounder to worry about.

8
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:11,249
So let's say we are doing this study we're talking about or restricting to people who have a family history of cardiovascular disease.

9
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:16,830
Right. We certainly have eliminated some of the thing that sets those people up for higher risk.

10
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:22,379
But on the other hand, there is a whole host of other things. You know, you might be confounding by obesity.

11
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:27,590
Maybe a doctor sees, you know, an obese patient and therefore is more likely to prescribe one drug over another.

12
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:35,280
It might be smoking. You know, the same thing there. Both obesity and smoking also set you up for more cardiovascular events in the future.

13
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:41,190
So while we are restricting on one thing, there's many other things that we have to worry about, too.

14
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:46,380
Now, that's not to say that restriction is not a helpful technique.

15
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:51,990
The reality is, is people will often choose to restrict on their strongest confounder.

16
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,400
So something that's most strongly associated with both the exposure and the outcome,

17
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:02,250
really in order to do the best job of eliminating as much confounding as they can.

18
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:05,640
And then they'll worry about the other factors analytically later.

19
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,630
Given that there's many different risk factors that come into play for each person,

20
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:17,479
another approach that we can use is using probabilistic measures that tell us

21
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:22,940
how at risk somebody is for our outcome for reasons other than our exposure.

22
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,579
Here we have this beautiful risk machine that's been generating, you know, risk scores.

23
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:34,430
Whether or not somebody is at high risk or low risk based on a whole host of different characteristics about them.

24
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:44,059
So based on their diet, based on their BMI, their smoking, their lipids and their age, it then uses that to figure out whether or not,

25
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:52,100
based on all of those factors, you are going to be a high risk person for cardiovascular disease or a low risk factor for cardiovascular disease.

26
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:57,410
Some examples of this kind of probabilistic measure would be a propensity score.

27
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:05,600
Other things are like deterministic scores, like a Framingham risk score that's been generated based on people's risk factors.

28
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:10,370
And that's used to say how likely it is that somebody is going to get a cardiovascular event.

29
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:21,200
So instead of now restricting based on family history, we could potentially use one of these risk scores in order to minimize confounding.

30
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:25,400
So are you at high risk based on this constellation of factors or not?

31
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:35,410
Of course, the idea of this continuous risk score shown here in this histogram raises one last issue that we have with restriction.

32
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:42,100
And the issue is, is that confounders are rarely distributed just as a yes or no variable.

33
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:50,440
In our example, you might have this very continuous measure of how high risk you have for cardiovascular events.

34
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:56,500
And therefore, in order to restrict our population, I have to have some sort of cutoff point where I say,

35
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:00,820
you're a high risk person, you're a low risk person, therefore you're in my study and you're not.

36
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:07,990
As you can imagine, by making this cut point, we still can have a problem with residual confounding,

37
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:11,860
because now even within one group you're high risk.

38
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:16,180
There still is a range of different risks within that level.

39
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:23,210
So in summary, for restriction, it's great, it's straightforward, it's inexpensive.

40
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:31,220
On the other hand, you have issues where it has limited number of restrictions possible and you can still have residual confounding due to cut offs.

41
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:36,630
Our final design strategy we're going to talk about is about matching.

42
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:42,210
So as you may remember, matching is a strategy where in a case control study,

43
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:48,240
we basically match cases and controls on variables that might be a possible confounder

44
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:54,149
of the associations we're interested in between exposure and disease in a cohort study.

45
00:04:54,150 --> 00:05:00,330
In contrast, what we match on is exposed and unexposed individuals with respect to that confounder.

46
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:07,830
By doing this matching, what you're effectively doing is breaking the association between the confounder and the disease.

47
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:15,180
In the case control design and breaking the relationship between the exposure and the disease for a cohort design.

48
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:20,690
Now when we match, we can do this on an individual level.

49
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:26,570
So pairing each person with another person who looks just like them based on their age and their sex,

50
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:33,680
maybe the date that we see them, or we can balance our populations more broadly as a group.

51
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:43,220
In that case, what we might do is to make sure that the distribution of confounders is similar between cases and controls in the case control design,

52
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:47,390
or between exposed and unexposed in the cohort design.

53
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:55,770
Just like restriction matching can be challenging if you try and match on too many factors.

54
00:05:56,390 --> 00:06:05,600
While you might be able to find somebody who pairs with another person based on age and race, ethnicity and socioeconomic status, for example.

55
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:11,500
Once you start going down, too many factors, you know, is your brother's name Bob right?

56
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:17,360
It's going to be very hard to find a comparison person to match with your person of interest.

57
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:26,750
Similarly, just like we had the situation of a continuous risk score introducing residual confounding by breaking it as a category.

58
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:32,760
We have the same problem here when we're trying to match. So in summary,

59
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:38,790
we've talked through three different examples of ways that in the design we can try and address confounding

60
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:47,250
randomization restriction and matching matching has very similar characteristics to restriction.

61
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,140
It's just a slightly different approach.
