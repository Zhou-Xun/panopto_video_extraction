1
00:00:05,645 --> 00:00:09,667
In science,
when we use the ABT narrative structure,

2
00:00:09,667 --> 00:00:15,160
it tends to be particularly useful
to tell two key kinds of stories.

3
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:19,320
The first,
is the story of the research question.

4
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,930
What do we not know?

5
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:21,896
And the second,

6
00:00:21,896 --> 00:00:25,770
is the story of the critical
takeaway from the research findings.

7
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:31,010
The thing we want the audience to most
understand about what has been learned.

8
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:37,300
Thus, I often like to summarize research
using what I would call the ABT x2 format.

9
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,680
Let me walk you through it.

10
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,430
The Research Question ABT,
basically flows this way.

11
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:46,200
And what is known already.

12
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:51,040
But here's what is not yet known,
the problem, the thing we don't know,

13
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,870
the knowledge gap.

14
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:57,860
Therefore, because we have this knowledge
gap, we need to do a particular study.

15
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:02,740
We need to learn more to resolve
the tension that we're now feeling.

16
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:06,636
The research finding ABT
is a little bit different.

17
00:01:06,636 --> 00:01:12,790
We talking about the stuff that's been
found, that is, what was expected?

18
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:15,130
What was not surprising?

19
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:19,290
And then we make a shift to but,
but this is the critically piece.

20
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,330
But this is what was surprising.

21
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,920
But this is what confirms our hypothesis.

22
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,860
Whatever that critical piece is, that
is what we want people to focus in on.

23
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:35,180
Because that critical piece, therefore,
leads to the study implications,

24
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:40,820
to what we need to do as a result
of the science that we've now done.

25
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,470
See how simple this is?

26
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:46,330
The ABT structure helps you
focus on the two key ideas.

27
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:50,500
The question or hypothesis that you have,
and the critical finding.

28
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,690
That is what you most want
people to pay attention to.

29
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:58,420
And everything else is simply
there to support those key ideas.

30
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,850
It actually aligns well with
the standard structure.

31
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:02,850
It just makes it a little bit clearer.

32
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:07,010
If we take that sort of hour
glass structure I had before,

33
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:11,789
big picture context and
the background aligns with what we know.

34
00:02:11,789 --> 00:02:15,310
And then,
we have to set up what's the hypothesis?

35
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:17,860
What's the thing we don't yet know?

36
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:21,320
Which leads us to, what we must do?

37
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,410
Which is our method.

38
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:27,770
We must do a study which uses these
particular methods to get the data.

39
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:29,840
And the data breaks down into two pieces,

40
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,929
the stuff that we learn that we
kinda knew we were gonna learn.

41
00:02:32,929 --> 00:02:36,979
Or the basic background data,
and the critical findings,

42
00:02:36,979 --> 00:02:42,440
the surprising findings,
the stuff we want people to focus in on.

43
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,170
Which leads to the interpretation
impact implications,

44
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:49,170
which is the therefore
of the second ABT story.

45
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:52,850
What does this mean for the world?

46
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:59,270
Now, let me give you an example of the ABT
x2 structure from my own research.

47
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:02,290
The central message is this,

48
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:07,080
we need to improve how we present
laboratory test results to patients.

49
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,340
So, here it goes.

50
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:13,840
Patient's with chronic diseases like
diabetes often need to get laboratory

51
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,390
tests, blood tests, to check how well
they're doing with their disease.

52
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:23,780
And this information can help those
patients with self management tasks.

53
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:27,950
And more, and more,
patients can view their result online

54
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:32,580
by logging on to websites ran by
their hospital or health system.

55
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:37,742
But those websites present the test
results in number heavy tables,

56
00:03:37,742 --> 00:03:42,293
that we know are very difficult for
patients to understand.

57
00:03:42,293 --> 00:03:47,057
Therefore, we wanted to see if we could
design visual displays of laboratory test

58
00:03:47,057 --> 00:03:52,280
results, that patients would
find easier to understand.

59
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,740
We conducted a series of experiments
as part of this project.

60
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:58,580
And we've found not surprisingly,

61
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:03,730
that our visual displays were indeed
easier for patients to understand.

62
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:09,660
But we also found that these displays were
particularly good at helping patients

63
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:14,700
not worry about results that
are just barely not normal,

64
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,870
and are not medically concerning.

65
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:22,950
Therefore, our results suggest that if
hospitals would adopt this type of visual

66
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:27,900
display, patients might be
both better informed, and

67
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:33,110
have less unnecessary
worry about their results.

68
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:37,080
See, you can tell a linear, logical, and

69
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:43,450
engaging story about health science
with just, and, but, therefore.
