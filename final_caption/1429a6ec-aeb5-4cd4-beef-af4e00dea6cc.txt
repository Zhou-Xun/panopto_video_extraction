00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:21,100
Hey. Good morning, folks. It's really crazy to believe that our last blast, it was like 70 degrees outside, right?

2
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:28,270
I mean, what a drastic he. Okay, so a few things today.

3
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:34,120
I didn't quite finish the lecture. I think it's like three more slides and it was manage that up.

4
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:40,659
But then I go to an end class exercise which will take kind of most of the class period and then

5
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:45,940
we'll finish up with a little bit of an opportunity to have some breakout to into our debate.

6
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:57,580
All right. So I think I left off at this slide where we were talking about how going back many decades,

7
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:05,980
the first standards for airborne particulate matter were around something called total suspended particulate.

8
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:10,630
Right. So this just means all particles in the air based on their mass.

9
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:18,190
Right. So if we take a filter and weigh it and then we take it on the field and pull air through it,

10
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:23,620
known boiling over here and then bring the filter back in a way to get in the lab.

11
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,440
That's the pre way from the post to ET.

12
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:33,220
And the difference is the mass of particles that have accumulated on that filter divided by the volume of air that we've sampled,

13
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:42,070
that would be a gram of air, first cubic meter of air.

14
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:50,770
Now, as we learn more research, exposure and outcomes studies,

15
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:59,950
we learned that it was really particles that were less than ten microns, that are respirable, that get into our airways.

16
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:04,060
And so that standard was replaced.

17
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:08,170
It was no longer a TSA PE standard, it was now a PM10 standard.

18
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:19,090
And then in the late 1990s, that research further informed the process and that independently there was particles of an even

19
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:26,870
smaller size by 2.5 that were known to cause an additional layer of very specific health effects.

20
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:32,750
And so since then we've had both a PM10 and Anti Point five standard.

21
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:40,660
And I think we were kind of talking about this what's next art at the end of the last lecture asking the question,

22
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:49,090
how important is chemical composition? Right now, the math is pretty much acknowledging that it's the way we classify things in this class.

23
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,950
Physical exposure, really, right?

24
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:59,770
It's something with the masses bombarding our lungs, but nothing about the chemical nature is included and any type of air quality standards.

25
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,250
These particles are made up of all different types of chemicals.

26
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:11,620
And part of the reason why there isn't a standard for chemicals in particulate matter is because the composition varies so greatly,

27
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,140
both temporally and spatially.

28
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:22,360
So it's really hard to regulate it, really hard to put, you know, what a protective value is, would be protective of public health.

29
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:28,180
We talked about this one. What's more important, the bulk composition so we can analyze these parts.

30
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:37,090
All right. Digest them and determine how much is iron, how much is silver and so forth, how much is sodium.

31
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,920
But really, it might be what's on the surface of the particles, right?

32
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,330
That's once they're inhaled, that's what's actually coming into contact with our linings.

33
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:56,530
We talked about particle number, right? This is I was drawing on this line and probably smaller particles of equal mass, uh,

34
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:01,510
might be more concerning for health just because they have an increased surface area

35
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:07,240
relative to a single larger particle or equal mass and then instantaneous exposure.

36
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:18,040
This gets to the smallest time frame that we have a standard for is a 24 hour standard or for ambient air quality.

37
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:21,670
And should we be concerned about a smaller than that?

38
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:25,720
You know, like there is a one hour standard for ozone.

39
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:29,830
Is that something that would be important for PM? And again,

40
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:39,010
that difference in chemical composition is what proves to be elusive for actually being able to pin down a standard of that short of a duration.

41
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:44,230
Okay, this is kind of like backing out.

42
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:53,320
I began this lecture talking about, you know, if you ask me, what are the primary global air pollution problems that we face, this is kind of a list,

43
00:04:53,740 --> 00:05:03,760
a lecture focused almost specifically on urban smog, urban air pollution issues, which are driven by primarily particulate matter and ozone gas.

44
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:12,050
In terms of the solution or maybe just the finger point, the cause of the problem, not just for urban smog,

45
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:21,500
but also for atmospheric deposition, the mercury that gets into ecosystems, the persistent organics, the greenhouse gas emissions.

46
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:30,960
And actually on a global basis, much of the household pollution is all responsible attributed to fossil fuel emissions.

47
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:33,140
So that vast majority of it really is.

48
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:41,270
So this is something as we kind of like sway back and forth between the lines of exposure science, but then also a little bit of environmental policy.

49
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:48,709
Right. These are opportunities for for leveraging and synergy for policy.

50
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:56,870
Right. Because if we can make headway into fossil fuel emissions, it's not just climate change.

51
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:02,550
Right? It's going to have huge benefits. Urban smog is kind of like an atmospheric position.

52
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:12,049
And so and then this is the little bit of the downside kind of conclusion of it is that we're

53
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:20,090
transitioning this is kind of looking at global scale emissions related to energy supply.

54
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,760
And, you know, going forward, while we're making progress, it's very small and incremental.

55
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:36,800
So greater than 80% over the next decade or so of our global supply of energy will continue to be some form of fossil fuel.

56
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:42,410
We are making a little bit of a transition going from for natural gas.

57
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:47,270
Natural gas isn't an ultimate solution. It's still a huge carbon emitter.

58
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:53,540
It does have a little bit lower levels of some of those air pollutants that we'd be concerned about liquid nitrogen oxide,

59
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:57,200
sulfur dioxide and so forth. And it's not meant to be.

60
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:04,400
I don't think anybody use it as a long term solution to produce an interim before we can get to more of those sustainable,

61
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,580
renewable sources of energy on a broader scale.

62
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:13,399
All right. So that's my wrap up of the lecture. Does anyone have any questions?

63
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,470
And I want to go here first and then come back to Kate and then whoever else has questions.

64
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:22,590
Yeah, I was just wondering if this graphic was updated, like with the recent climate conferences?

65
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:26,060
Absolutely not. Because that was like yesterday or something.

66
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:34,219
It's it's still relatively accurate. And there are a lot of and this would be, you know, newsworthy.

67
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:40,400
Right. That the latest version has taken place in Egypt and.

68
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:46,970
Several things to point to, one being the war going on right now.

69
00:07:46,980 --> 00:08:00,960
I mean, it is unfortunately and this is a whole separate discussion, but it's very much about energy and not in a very nice way, to put it mildly.

70
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:09,600
And so, you know, kind of that way, if you can call it that or momentum that that we kind of had going,

71
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:15,479
whether it's as a country or as a globe is facing additional challenges.

72
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:23,070
Right. Because the kind of geopolitics that are new 2022 beyond what we were previously concerned about.

73
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:26,520
That's a really general answer to your to your question.

74
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:35,040
Did you want to ask like a follow up or anything that, I guess do you happen to know like when these were generated?

75
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:47,880
Yeah. I mean, these are going back a while ago, but I know that they're they're so very accurate for I mean, the projection only goes to 2035.

76
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:52,880
But yeah, we are I mean, we talk a lot about the U.S., right?

77
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:57,600
And we have our own challenges. It's much worse across the globe.

78
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:03,530
Thank you. Yeah, I think basically my question, I just wanted to add two more things.

79
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:13,999
So when I'm curious if renewables would be higher here in the U.S. since 2007, which is when the or in 2006,

80
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,640
just because the efficiency has gone up since 2007 in rubles and the price of it has gone down.

81
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:30,919
Right. And then I think it would be interesting if you want to look at something that's projecting the stuff that's more recent than 27,

82
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:36,600
I would look at that, not at the climate negotiations, because that's a lot of hot air.

83
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:47,360
I studied them for four years, but also but I would look at the International Panel for Climate Change 2022 projections for where stuff is going.

84
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:51,710
But yeah, I'm curious if you have any thoughts on renewables. Yeah.

85
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:56,990
No, I mean, the the science behind it. Right. Is not the not the contention.

86
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:05,720
And I wonder, was it. When I had this slide in this lecture somewhere, I mean, there was that really pretty picture.

87
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:16,969
I don't like the slide that is focused on, you know, that science of the kind of conflict.

88
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:21,260
Right. That's very much where we are. Uh, it it used to be.

89
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:26,420
And I think, you know, you're kind of alluding to, like, the market for it, right?

90
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:30,080
It used to have to be, like, heavily subsidized to be able to water.

91
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:34,910
Now, there's actually, like, very legitimate reasons from a consumer perspective.

92
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:45,860
It just hasn't happened on a scale that any of us had hoped, at least at this point in 2022.

93
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:54,370
And then, yeah, I mean, the projections are hard because even a year ago the projections are much more rosy than they even are now.

94
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:57,980
I just because of this work now going on,

95
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:06,890
that it is getting worse from an energy perspective as we get into the winter and it is the higher dependance of it.

96
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:16,700
Any other approach for another and. This could be an entire separate class.

97
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:21,460
Right. And there are many classes focused specifically around global climate.

98
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:32,240
All right. And we will actually talk specifically in a couple of weeks about climate change itself and in fact,

99
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:38,210
also separate from some air quality information, these other concerns.

100
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:47,480
All right. So let's shift gears into our next one. And I think, uh, let's see.

101
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:53,300
These are these are our options. So we're going to go through we're going to break out into groups,

102
00:11:53,780 --> 00:12:02,900
and each group is going to be assigned a group number and you're going to be posed with a population or situation to consider.

103
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:08,480
One of them is volatile organic chemicals present in drinking water in a rural community.

104
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:14,630
Right. And then in parentheses, it's kind of a classification. It's a chemical agent, which is a community setting.

105
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:24,710
I'm going to propose that we skip number to that one just a little too fresh for most of us in our real world experience.

106
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:29,060
Number three is radon exposures among underground miners.

107
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:36,890
So in this case, a physical agent focusing on an occupational setting, a number for silica dust exposures among construction workers.

108
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:44,750
So back to a chemical agent, but staying within an occupational setting and the last one being noise exposure is among concertgoers and staff.

109
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:49,870
So a physical agent. But components of both would be workers.

110
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:55,640
Right. But also many community members attending it. The task is going to be for each group.

111
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:02,270
So we're continuing down this path, right? We've classified all of these different types of exposures.

112
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:07,760
We've looked at their pathways, their roots, how we are actually exposed.

113
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,010
And we've started talking about or we already have talked about controls, right?

114
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,730
So using the hierarchy of controls.

115
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:20,870
So we're going to actually go through that and apply that to using these relevant exposure controls that we've learned about.

116
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:30,110
Come up with some methods for what would be those controls of opportunity in these specific scenarios.

117
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:37,460
And then importantly, come up with some methods for how you would conduct exposure surveillance within that setting.

118
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:43,220
Right, to confirm that the controls that you have implemented are reducing the exposures.

119
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:47,230
And I'm gonna, uh, come up with a suggestion here.

120
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:52,870
One is that okay, so, you know, number five, for example, noise exposure among concertgoers and staff.

121
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:59,360
Think through all of the possible exposure controls that might apply in that situation.

122
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:10,669
But then for, you know, perhaps four methods for conducting it, maybe just think of your top two that you'd actually want to implement as controls.

123
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:18,200
And then based on that, I come up with a method or methods for how you would conduct surveillance.

124
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,680
And then you have the parentheses here just to kind of help you think through it.

125
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:31,129
Feel free to make up whatever details you want to about, about your specific scenario in order to help develop and describe those.

126
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:34,640
And then once we have a breakout and then once we're done,

127
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:40,610
will reconvene and have each group have an opportunity to kind of report back out to the class.

128
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:48,170
So, okay, I'm gonna do this Dr. O'Neill style and ask you all to count off your trip.

129
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:51,500
It's only 845. Let's see if we can do it.

130
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:59,059
We're going to skip number two. So count off one, three, four, five, and then we'll just keep going.

131
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:05,389
I think we can do that. Let's start let's start over here in the front with Morgan and we'll kind of work our way back.

132
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:12,890
One, three, four, five, three, four, five, one, three.

133
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:21,760
One three, four, five, one, three.

134
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:28,380
409913.

135
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:33,430
I got both the right. Go for it. One.

136
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:38,220
Awesome. All right. Uh, and then we usually it's kind of pointed, right?

137
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:42,990
I think we would really maybe do one of. You're actually.

138
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:46,650
Yeah. That one's going to have this whole section, too.

139
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:50,940
Like, in the front of this note. Two threes.

140
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:57,500
I'm the one who can manage to breathe up here or is kind of in the back, even if you want to use the stairs.

141
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:11,970
And I'm will here on this side and let's go ahead and take about 20 minutes of exposure, even if it's off canvas if you want to download it.

142
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:19,301
I looked at it. You know, I have. Like I was just thinking, he's just 30 and I'm going to play something great.

143
00:16:27,992 --> 00:16:31,352
All right. Let's go ahead and do our report out.

144
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:38,072
And just to kind of reverse things, let's let's go well, count down by group number.

145
00:16:38,732 --> 00:16:41,982
So let's go ahead and start over here.

146
00:16:41,982 --> 00:16:46,482
Right, with group number five with the noise exposures.

147
00:16:46,892 --> 00:16:55,292
So what did you all come up with? And like any particular order, we just figured you can't really eliminate it.

148
00:16:55,862 --> 00:17:03,812
Like at a concert. It is what it is, but at least in terms of but also in terms of staff in the community, because it's too different.

149
00:17:04,172 --> 00:17:09,992
So for a community, for people who live near the venue,

150
00:17:10,022 --> 00:17:18,032
like either some kind of sound barrier or just straight up like distance from like neighboring like residential areas would be a really big one.

151
00:17:19,322 --> 00:17:28,622
And then for people coming to the concert willingly, just like warnings, providing earplugs and like little manuals and how you put them in.

152
00:17:28,952 --> 00:17:36,122
And then a bigger one is when they're buying tickets, you can put like sound mapping on the concert map so they can see if they like.

153
00:17:36,122 --> 00:17:42,752
We'll get a super high exposure where they sit. So they have hearing issues, they can move around where they want.

154
00:17:44,102 --> 00:17:49,322
And then for staff, some bigger ones are swapping them around.

155
00:17:50,042 --> 00:17:58,322
So like if your staff position is right next to the speaker, maybe you should be there the whole time and like moving them around consistently.

156
00:17:58,322 --> 00:18:01,441
So not everyone's getting like the same amount of exposure,

157
00:18:01,442 --> 00:18:07,682
not someone's getting blasted with sound carpeting and like absorption materials in staff area,

158
00:18:07,692 --> 00:18:12,362
but they don't have to be like out in the actual concert hall.

159
00:18:12,722 --> 00:18:16,352
And then for assessment methods,

160
00:18:16,442 --> 00:18:24,362
they can put like personal monitors in the staff and see spouse swapping is changing your hearing tests over time for the

161
00:18:24,362 --> 00:18:30,872
staff and then community like sound level measuring around the concert hall and within the concert hall to see how bad it is.

162
00:18:31,612 --> 00:18:35,592
Right. Great. Yeah. And you started with, you know, of the obvious, right?

163
00:18:35,612 --> 00:18:39,091
It's a tough one. The whole point of a concert is to make noise, right?

164
00:18:39,092 --> 00:18:44,612
So how do you safely at a safe noise level appreciate the noise.

165
00:18:45,242 --> 00:18:48,481
Yeah, I think you guys I'm just trying to cut through. You hit on many of them, right?

166
00:18:48,482 --> 00:18:52,501
Administrative controls, engineering controls, personal protective equipment.

167
00:18:52,502 --> 00:18:56,072
Right. Kind of education warnings. I like that.

168
00:18:56,072 --> 00:19:01,501
I like the sound map concept. Right. Maybe even when you're like online purchasing tickets or whatever.

169
00:19:01,502 --> 00:19:05,581
Right. And you have like the sound map available. So you kind of know. Awesome, great.

170
00:19:05,582 --> 00:19:11,972
Great job, you guys. Let's move on to group number four right in the back.

171
00:19:12,092 --> 00:19:15,272
Who is looking at the silica dust exposures?

172
00:19:21,842 --> 00:19:28,812
So at the end, this was item number two. Step two is identifying a spokesperson to report out.

173
00:19:28,832 --> 00:19:31,832
And you can kind of do it as a group, feel like it doesn't have to be a single person.

174
00:19:35,612 --> 00:19:43,142
So some of the things that we talked about for exposure controls or engineering controls,

175
00:19:43,142 --> 00:19:50,912
we talked about having either fans or fans and filters for ventilation and filtering the dust out of the air.

176
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:57,482
We also talked about using like water sprays to reduce stuff.

177
00:19:57,512 --> 00:20:08,222
And so the recommendation from niacin, I think. Not having filters or respirators and masks.

178
00:20:09,732 --> 00:20:19,361
For exposure surveillance we talked about like using the filtrate from the mass to measure, like how much, how much the workers are breathing.

179
00:20:19,362 --> 00:20:24,882
And we talked about like taking the filters and like weighing them and then like I guess using

180
00:20:24,882 --> 00:20:29,982
a dust sample to measure like the composition and like using that to calculate how much,

181
00:20:30,882 --> 00:20:33,972
how much is actually like getting to the worker.

182
00:20:36,492 --> 00:20:43,481
And then we also talked about how like a lot of like biometric monitoring might not be relevant because it's

183
00:20:43,482 --> 00:20:49,822
hard to tell like what kind of lung damage is caused by silica dust or like other things like smoking.

184
00:20:50,352 --> 00:20:58,702
Um. So we would mostly measure the exposure through the filter and my personal water.

185
00:21:00,082 --> 00:21:06,192
Right. Okay. Yeah. Thank you. And similarly, you could add some, uh, some of the same themes as the other group.

186
00:21:06,202 --> 00:21:11,992
Write some, some administrative controls, uh, some kind of engineering controls, you know,

187
00:21:11,992 --> 00:21:17,391
certainly the personal protective equipment, uh, and then, yeah, you know, personal monitoring,

188
00:21:17,392 --> 00:21:25,222
which would be kind of, uh, the most obvious, but then also easy to institute as well in terms of actually,

189
00:21:25,762 --> 00:21:30,952
uh, characterizing what workers are being exposed to as kind of the surveillance method.

190
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:37,162
Nice job. Thank you. Uh, and then coming up here, right to group number three.

191
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:43,792
Not to you. Yeah. So we were looking at radon exposures for underground miners.

192
00:21:44,452 --> 00:21:50,781
As far as elimination substitution, though, again, you can't really eliminate it's a natural phenomenon.

193
00:21:50,782 --> 00:21:56,782
Um, not a whole lot you can do unless you eliminate the job altogether, which is a whole other topic.

194
00:21:57,952 --> 00:22:04,222
As far as engineering controls, we found things like ventilation, particularly in the summer.

195
00:22:04,822 --> 00:22:11,421
The amount of radon found underground is usually higher in the summer because of stagnant

196
00:22:11,422 --> 00:22:17,122
air based on the temperature differences outside or like aboveground versus underground.

197
00:22:18,202 --> 00:22:27,952
And we also saw different ways for filling gaps underground, like using different pulps, what pulp or foams.

198
00:22:28,282 --> 00:22:34,252
And that way the radon has a harder time actually escaping as far as warnings,

199
00:22:34,492 --> 00:22:41,961
maybe using like a Geiger counter since radon is radioactive for trainings and procedures.

200
00:22:41,962 --> 00:22:48,142
If MSHA, which is the mining version of OSHA, has any trainings, that could be good.

201
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:58,282
Um, especially we, we found that mining and radon exposure is like the second greatest cause for lung cancer after smoking.

202
00:22:58,582 --> 00:23:02,422
So if you're a smoker and you're a miner, it's like a really bad combination.

203
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:08,392
So trainings about like, hey, maybe you shouldn't be smoking while also being a miner.

204
00:23:09,682 --> 00:23:16,761
And then for personal protective equipment, there's obviously lots for miners,

205
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:23,182
but for radon specifically, we found a particulate filtering respirator that people could wear.

206
00:23:24,652 --> 00:23:32,992
So our thought was to focus on the engineering controls, particularly the ventilation and the kind of stopping different leaks.

207
00:23:33,622 --> 00:23:47,242
And the best way to test the situation is probably by testing the radon levels pre and post it's we were

208
00:23:47,242 --> 00:23:52,342
trying to figure out if there's like something that you can personally wear to test radon exposure.

209
00:23:53,002 --> 00:24:01,372
And we because we know that there are such things as like little passive monitors but I didn't find anything like that could actually be on a person.

210
00:24:01,372 --> 00:24:02,962
I don't that doesn't mean that they don't exist.

211
00:24:04,132 --> 00:24:13,912
And then if possible to like do a majority of the mining seasonally like in the colder months where there's not as much exposure to radon anything.

212
00:24:14,782 --> 00:24:19,342
That's great. Just great work. Uh, proof number three, not two.

213
00:24:20,212 --> 00:24:23,692
Yeah. So you hit on some really good ones, I think.

214
00:24:23,842 --> 00:24:30,772
And there definitely are personal monitors that can be worn to assess radon exposure for miners.

215
00:24:31,102 --> 00:24:37,012
And yeah, this is another tough one, right? Like radon gas, it's decaying.

216
00:24:37,132 --> 00:24:40,132
Uh, you know, the source is, is underground. It's in the earth.

217
00:24:40,612 --> 00:24:45,592
And so it's mining, right? So you have to be down there in order to actually mine.

218
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:55,971
So that is the definition of a mine or is to be, you know, physically put in, uh, in very close proximity to the source of it in the first place.

219
00:24:55,972 --> 00:24:59,992
But yeah, you've hit on some good ones. I think you're right. The, um, the ventilation.

220
00:25:00,772 --> 00:25:04,642
I'm also interested. Like the what the.

221
00:25:04,792 --> 00:25:12,052
I don't, I'm not an expert on mines at all, but the suggestion of not mining so much in the winter.

222
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:15,892
Right in the summer and the summer. Okay. Anymore. Okay, more in the winter.

223
00:25:15,892 --> 00:25:20,751
Okay. So what that you are thinking now about, you know,

224
00:25:20,752 --> 00:25:30,262
shifting gears or like thermal exposure or whatever does that what's the dynamic between summer and winter seasons and how much it varies.

225
00:25:31,612 --> 00:25:36,681
You can say within the mine, the radar is like extreme, like this is something that summer.

226
00:25:36,682 --> 00:25:40,282
Yeah. Okay. Oh, right. Yeah, for sure.

227
00:25:40,282 --> 00:25:46,372
And it's a great suggestion, right. If it can be managed, uh, and whenever it's summer, go on vacation.

228
00:25:47,602 --> 00:25:51,442
Don't be mining this week. The miners would enjoy having.

229
00:25:51,862 --> 00:25:55,792
Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. All right.

230
00:25:55,882 --> 00:26:01,252
Nice work. Uh, let's see. It went for number one, right?

231
00:26:01,642 --> 00:26:07,642
You had the VRC present in drinking water in a rural community.

232
00:26:08,632 --> 00:26:16,011
What? I wanted to come up with something also just assumed that it would be mostly, well, water, like, without that assumption.

233
00:26:16,012 --> 00:26:22,312
But because we have a lot of different sources inside that a limitation would really be an option for us.

234
00:26:23,692 --> 00:26:30,341
So instead we thought about, well, first we need to issue warnings to inform the community that their drinking water is contaminated

235
00:26:30,342 --> 00:26:37,282
and possibly so getting that out there and then also offering a temporary substitution by giving

236
00:26:37,282 --> 00:26:45,021
bottled water before or while we're addressing the issue in their drinking water and then distributing

237
00:26:45,022 --> 00:26:50,272
engineering controls such as activated carbon filters to put in their drinking water systems.

238
00:26:50,692 --> 00:27:01,222
And along with that training on how to properly install it, how to maintain the filter and all those things that go along with it and then to.

239
00:27:03,432 --> 00:27:05,522
Like evaluate our control methods.

240
00:27:05,532 --> 00:27:12,521
We were going to do some biomarkers to see like the levels of doses in the community before and after our intervention,

241
00:27:12,522 --> 00:27:16,392
and then also test the water before and after our intervention.

242
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:21,371
All right. Nice work. Yeah, that's a tough one, right?

243
00:27:21,372 --> 00:27:27,162
Because, I mean, you could have just as easily said, we're gonna assume they have a municipal drinking water source.

244
00:27:27,162 --> 00:27:30,912
Right. And kind of run with that. But you're probably more accurate, right?

245
00:27:30,912 --> 00:27:36,362
Assuming that there is a higher percentage that is private a while.

246
00:27:36,552 --> 00:27:39,852
Right. For the source of drinking water. So nice job with that.

247
00:27:40,242 --> 00:27:44,312
Okay. Yeah. So this is just a little bit more of an actual application, right?

248
00:27:44,322 --> 00:27:51,492
We kind of we did some examples as we were going through those controls, uh, hiring controls in both occupational and community settings.

249
00:27:51,942 --> 00:27:54,042
This is just another opportunity to, you know,

250
00:27:54,042 --> 00:27:59,681
as a group to be able to talk through some specific examples and not just, you know, what those controls might be.

251
00:27:59,682 --> 00:28:02,412
But then, you know, back to our exposure monitoring,

252
00:28:02,412 --> 00:28:08,472
how would you actually act over the surveillance plant to confirm that your your controls are, in fact, working?

253
00:28:09,522 --> 00:28:23,442
All right. So that leaves us with our last agenda item for the class session today, which is a little bit more time for some debate team breakouts.

254
00:28:23,442 --> 00:28:26,922
And discussion is to continue to get your guys yourselves organized.

255
00:28:27,312 --> 00:28:34,362
I wanted to make one. Uh, I guess it's an announcement ere's where we are today, November 15.

256
00:28:35,472 --> 00:28:44,172
On Thursday, Professor Juan Eugene, who's one of my colleagues here in environmental sciences, is going to join Take US Lecture.

257
00:28:44,922 --> 00:28:50,462
His expertise is, as you might imagine, is around water quality issues, an impact on health.

258
00:28:50,472 --> 00:28:57,792
He's got some really cool stuff going on that he's going to share logistically.

259
00:28:58,362 --> 00:29:02,052
I wanted to share, you know, that I'm always here, right?

260
00:29:02,052 --> 00:29:06,312
Even when we have guest lectures on this Thursday, unfortunately, I won't be able to be.

261
00:29:06,402 --> 00:29:15,522
So I apologize for that in advance. I'm in, uh, all day long and I grant review sessions on both Thursday and Friday.

262
00:29:16,722 --> 00:29:20,472
I'm still available over email or whatever, so things come up as usual.

263
00:29:20,472 --> 00:29:26,052
Don't hesitate to reach out to me, but yeah, professors, you'll be here to kind of manage everything.

264
00:29:26,652 --> 00:29:31,752
So, yeah, that was just a quick announcement and.

265
00:29:32,832 --> 00:29:37,542
All right, what's our best way to organize? Actually, I'm going to let you guys do that.

266
00:29:38,262 --> 00:29:41,472
I clearly failed the first time around.

267
00:29:41,472 --> 00:29:46,482
So it's it's 921. We've got not quite a half an hour left in the class period.

268
00:29:46,902 --> 00:29:50,052
Yeah. Why don't you guys kind of self-selecting to a group?
