00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:08,490
Hi, I'm Carrie
Karvonen-Gutierrez.

2
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,370
I'm a faculty member in
the Department of Epidemiology.

3
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,640
Today, we're going to talk
about acute inflammation.

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,740
Acute inflammation is the way

5
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,840
in which our body works
to keep us healthy in

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,955
response to a pathogen or

7
00:00:20,955 --> 00:00:23,700
other invader or
some type of injury.

8
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,650
Inflammation is vital for

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,810
the health and
repair of our body.

10
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,755
It serves as a non-specific
defense mechanism

11
00:00:30,755 --> 00:00:32,885
against injuries and invaders,

12
00:00:32,885 --> 00:00:35,330
and also works to signal
the immune system

13
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:38,000
to respond to specific pathogens.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,735
Inflammation can be
either acute or chronic.

15
00:00:41,735 --> 00:00:43,190
In this module, we will

16
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:44,570
learn about
the difference between

17
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:47,600
acute and chronic inflammation
and specifically,

18
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,125
how acute inflammation
works to keep us healthy.

19
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:54,380
The immediate inflammatory
responses that are

20
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:57,680
vital to our health are
known as acute inflammation.

21
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,570
You may have likely experienced

22
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:01,805
acute inflammation
in your own life.

23
00:01:01,805 --> 00:01:04,790
Perhaps you've had
a sore throat after exposure to

24
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:07,100
a pathogen or had pain and

25
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,785
redness in your finger
if you have a splinter,

26
00:01:09,785 --> 00:01:11,390
or perhaps you fell playing

27
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:14,045
basketball and experienced
a swollen knee.

28
00:01:14,045 --> 00:01:15,980
All of these are examples of

29
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:18,800
the acute inflammatory response.

30
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:23,120
Acute inflammation is the
short-term immediate response

31
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,475
to local injuries or invaders.

32
00:01:25,475 --> 00:01:27,710
The acute inflammatory
response can

33
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:29,960
be measured in hours or days.

34
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,585
It's quite short.

35
00:01:31,585 --> 00:01:33,680
Unlike acute inflammation,

36
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,875
chronic inflammation lasts
for several weeks or longer.

37
00:01:36,875 --> 00:01:38,210
In our next module,

38
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:40,460
we will examine what
happens to our body when

39
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:43,325
it is in a chronically
inflamed state.

40
00:01:43,325 --> 00:01:47,240
Many things can trigger
an acute inflammatory response.

41
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,850
We can broadly classify
those factors as

42
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:53,165
either exogenous or endogenous.

43
00:01:53,165 --> 00:01:55,670
Exogenous factors are those that

44
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:58,670
invade and injure our body
from the outside.

45
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:00,140
We are often exposed to

46
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,660
pathogens from
our external environment,

47
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:05,149
so things like
viruses and bacteria

48
00:02:05,149 --> 00:02:08,105
might be considered
exogenous factors.

49
00:02:08,105 --> 00:02:10,580
Other examples of
exogenous factors

50
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,130
include toxins and
foreign bodies.

51
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:14,930
For example, that splinter that

52
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:16,715
might have been stuck
in your finger,

53
00:02:16,715 --> 00:02:19,405
that's an exogenous factor.

54
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:22,580
There can also be things
within our body that

55
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:25,310
can trigger an acute
inflammatory response.

56
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:27,890
These are known as
endogenous factors

57
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:29,770
because they come from within.

58
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:31,580
Products of cell death or

59
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,800
immune reactions are
both examples of

60
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,360
endogenous factors that can

61
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,820
trigger an inflammatory response.

62
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:41,150
This happens because as
cells die within our body,

63
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,875
they may become necrotic,

64
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:45,980
meaning that they release
toxins into our body.

65
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:48,770
Our inflammatory response
is initiated to

66
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:53,235
destroy these endogenous toxins
and keep us healthy.

67
00:02:53,235 --> 00:02:55,370
There are four goals of

68
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:58,540
the acute inflammatory
response shown here.

69
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,110
First, we work to

70
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:02,870
recognize the initial
infection or injury.

71
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:05,720
Our body has specific
signaling pathways

72
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,040
that are able to do that,

73
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,085
to recognize and
initiate a response.

74
00:03:10,085 --> 00:03:12,350
The acute inflammatory response

75
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:14,405
includes a vascular response.

76
00:03:14,405 --> 00:03:16,070
This is when the blood flow is

77
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,275
increased to the site of injury.

78
00:03:18,275 --> 00:03:20,970
Accordingly with
that vascular response,

79
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,790
we have a cellular
response that is

80
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:25,460
coordinated with
the vascular response.

81
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:28,190
The cellular response
occurs when we mobilize

82
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:31,880
products and cells of healing
to the site of injury,

83
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:36,505
so that we can repair and
clear out the damaged tissue.

84
00:03:36,505 --> 00:03:39,110
Finally, we remove
the injured tissue and

85
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:41,870
prepare the site for
healing and repair.

86
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,490
So let's take a look,

87
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:46,370
specifically at the vascular
and cellular responses

88
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:49,505
of our body with respect
to acute inflammation.

89
00:03:49,505 --> 00:03:51,680
In this picture, we
see that the thumb

90
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,480
is injured by a sharp object

91
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,370
breaking the surface of the skin

92
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:57,875
and bringing bacteria
into the wound.

93
00:03:57,875 --> 00:04:00,350
In response to
this tissue injury,

94
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:04,625
inflammatory mediators are
produced at nearby cells.

95
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:07,160
Inflammatory mediators
are molecules that

96
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,820
intensify and prolong
the inflammatory response.

97
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,610
This is good because we
want our body to be able to

98
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:17,045
mount an efficient
yet robust response.

99
00:04:17,045 --> 00:04:20,540
Histamine is an active
inflammatory mediator,

100
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:23,570
early in the acute
inflammatory response.

101
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:26,990
Release of histamine by
cells near the injury causes

102
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:31,415
capillaries or small blood
vessels to dilate or widen.

103
00:04:31,415 --> 00:04:33,830
The dilation of
capillaries allows for

104
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,390
more efficient transport of

105
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:37,820
needed cells to
the site of the injury.

106
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,920
Also in response to histamine,

107
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,650
the capillary membranes
or the outer walls of

108
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:45,860
the vessel become more
permeable or leaky,

109
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,750
to allow for easier transport of

110
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,375
white blood cells to
the site of the injury.

111
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:52,070
Both of these actions,

112
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:54,620
dilation and increased
leakiness of

113
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,570
the blood vessels allow for

114
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:59,270
more blood flow to
the site of injury.

115
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:02,715
This increased blood flow
results in redness and heat,

116
00:05:02,715 --> 00:05:05,550
two of the cardinal signs
of inflammation.

117
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:08,390
With the increased leakiness
of the vessel walls,

118
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:11,000
cells known as
phagocytes can more

119
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,570
easily move to
the injury and invasion.

120
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:17,590
Once phagocytes reach
the site of injury,

121
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,550
they work to engulf and destroy

122
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:22,760
bacteria and other
particles or debris.

123
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,925
This process is
called phagocytosis.

124
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:27,990
After phagocytes have engulfed

125
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:29,505
and destroyed the bacteria,

126
00:05:29,505 --> 00:05:32,180
platelets cross through
the capillary membrane

127
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,600
to help seal the wounded area.

128
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,220
As platelets and
other fluid cross through

129
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,510
the capillary membrane to

130
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:40,775
the area of infection or injury,

131
00:05:40,775 --> 00:05:42,625
we see that excess fluid,

132
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:44,390
called exudate accumulates at

133
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:47,014
the site and this
results in swelling,

134
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:50,585
another one of the cardinal
signs of inflammation.

135
00:05:50,585 --> 00:05:53,660
There are several
local manifestations

136
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:56,600
associated with the acute
inflammatory response.

137
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,760
Local manifestations
are those that

138
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,280
occur close to
the site of injury.

139
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,260
These local manifestations are

140
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,970
also called the cardinal signs of

141
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:08,780
inflammation and include
heat, redness, pain,

142
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:11,095
swelling and loss of function,

143
00:06:11,095 --> 00:06:13,280
and all of these are
primarily due to

144
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,360
the vasodilation and
fluid accumulation in tissues.

145
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,600
We can also experience
systemic manifestations

146
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,865
associated with
acute inflammation.

147
00:06:22,865 --> 00:06:25,130
Systemic manifestations
are things that

148
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:27,305
we can experience
throughout our whole body,

149
00:06:27,305 --> 00:06:29,675
not just at the localized site.

150
00:06:29,675 --> 00:06:32,870
Some examples of
systemic manifestations of

151
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:37,270
inflammation include
fever and leukocytosis.

152
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,740
Fever is due to the impact of

153
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:42,620
these inflammatory mediators
on the hypothalamus,

154
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:45,080
which trigger an overall
increase in temperature

155
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:48,340
throughout our body to
maintain homeostasis.

156
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,960
Leukocytosis is when we have

157
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,720
higher than normal levels
of white blood cells.

158
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,640
This is because
these white blood cells

159
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,530
are used by our body to

160
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:59,255
help destroy the pathogen

161
00:06:59,255 --> 00:07:01,434
and mount an
inflammatory response,

162
00:07:01,434 --> 00:07:04,630
and so when we have a need
for this type of response,

163
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:07,670
we have higher than
normal levels in our body.

164
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:09,500
In this module, we reviewed

165
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,665
the acute inflammatory response.

166
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:13,620
The acute inflammatory
response is

167
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,775
beneficial to our health
and well-being,

168
00:07:15,775 --> 00:07:18,260
as it is our body's way
to not only signal

169
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:21,245
the immune system to mount
a specific response,

170
00:07:21,245 --> 00:07:24,115
but also works
quickly, efficiently,

171
00:07:24,115 --> 00:07:26,450
and without need
for specificity to

172
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:28,415
any invader or pathogen

173
00:07:28,415 --> 00:07:30,560
or injury that we
might experience,

174
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,386
and in doing so, it works
to keep us healthy.
