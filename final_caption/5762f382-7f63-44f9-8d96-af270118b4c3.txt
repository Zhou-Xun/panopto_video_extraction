1
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:28,259
Okay. Well, welcome back. So today we have to talk about one of the probably I mean, I wouldn't say the most important but really,

2
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:35,610
really important topic in epidemiology, because actually this is something that other fields don't have to kind of like take into account.

3
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:43,770
Of course, the way we deal with this total energy intake is similar to other fields dealing with other important parallels.

4
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,790
But then of like this is very specific for nutrition.

5
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:59,460
I believe so. So what I'm going to do today and next week, so I'm the first part.

6
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:03,329
So today I'm going to talk about the components of total energy intake.

7
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:10,710
So you understand some of the things that you're actually measuring when you measure total energy intake in a population of studies.

8
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:15,719
Then I'm going to talk about why we have to adjust for total intake.

9
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:21,720
And this is I have like a slide with a three or four resource.

10
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:29,680
And if you cannot remember absolutely anything in this class but that thing, I will be happy.

11
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:35,309
So just that thin will be enough. Okay, so so that's the most important thing where we adjust for.

12
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:39,810
And, and next week, actually, we'll see when we don't need to adjust.

13
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:44,520
Okay. And then I'll go into the methods to adjust for total energy intake.

14
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:51,350
And then the methods are a little tricky because I'll tell you about the the good ones, the not so good ones.

15
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,749
And then you may be wondering what we are going to hear about.

16
00:01:54,750 --> 00:02:03,450
They're not good ones because, I mean, you learn something about kind of like heat and about the not good ones that nobody usually know about this.

17
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,300
Okay, so then you learn something.

18
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:14,150
So anyway, I will also kind of like emphasize the ones I want you to use and the ones we are going to use in the lab only.

19
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:20,160
Okay. And then we'll have the the first part of the lab in which we will use two of these methods.

20
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:30,719
So that's just for today. So next Friday, when I told you that two papers, the two readings for this class one,

21
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:36,090
you can kind of like just skip for your records because I'm digesting that one and I talk about that one now.

22
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:45,509
The second one is the Jake's article. You can please browse it because we will discuss it because it's also related

23
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:49,830
to the components of total energy intake and related to if we have to adjust.

24
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,550
I mean, is using calories from the 50 the best way to adjust?

25
00:02:55,110 --> 00:03:01,559
And then I'll go into some examples where you don't have to address that because in those situations, adjusting will be wrong.

26
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,629
Because, I mean, it's not like you have to just always okay, so then you have to to know to,

27
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:10,410
to differentiate that and then we'll go into, into the second part of the LE.

28
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:18,450
Okay. So regarding the, to the two readings I gave you and I told you for today,

29
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:24,180
you don't have to read anything because you I mean, you keep you can keep that paper from Dr. Will as well.

30
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:33,540
But will it when he kind of like basically percent they introduce the the receiver method so that's a kind of

31
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:39,149
like a similar table this another one actually I think a few years and this one he actually will introduce it.

32
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:41,970
I think I gave you the later one, but they are very similar.

33
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:50,040
So then I can I can tell you the the I always like to tell this anecdote to most you this when I first read that paper,

34
00:03:50,040 --> 00:04:01,350
I was doing my mph and I was reading the paper because just by chance it happened that I was assigned a project to work with that method.

35
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:06,030
Right. But I at that point, I didn't have really a huge interest in nutrition.

36
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:10,710
I didn't know what I was going to do in my life and everything. Right. But well, I mean, he came to my life.

37
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:17,760
So then I read the paper and the first time I read it, I didn't understand anything, anything at all.

38
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:21,510
It's so kind of like, you know, what is he talking about?

39
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:25,480
Colon, you know? Okay, it's okay. I don't really know that thing.

40
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,790
So I did the second time very carefully, kind of like didn't focus.

41
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:34,440
And I began to understand anything later and then everyday like Sarah Times.

42
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:42,270
And then after reading many times, I think I got like a hint of the I mean, what is that I'm doing?

43
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:48,240
And naturally I thought I was understanding it.

44
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:53,700
But then years later, when I actually learn the method again, you know,

45
00:04:53,700 --> 00:05:01,770
nutritional epidemiology class and I was using it in my own data, then that's when I say, Oh yeah, of course.

46
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:07,500
So, I mean, maybe you are smarter than I was, probably.

47
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:15,610
So don't worry. But I mean, the bottom line is that if you don't understand and you don't get the details and why we are doing this, that's fine.

48
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:20,810
That's fine. So don't worry about that because, I mean, sometimes the methods are a little, you know, kind of like tricky.

49
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:28,190
So I just want to make sure that you understand like a few things and those get in your brain.

50
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:33,740
So then in the future, when you confront this type of problem, at least it will ring a bell.

51
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:38,130
So we're kind of like, Oh yeah, we have to adjust for total energy intake probably, right?

52
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:43,819
What will be the best method? Maybe you can use the rest of us. Let's go to see how the receiver method is used.

53
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:51,680
So let's use another one. Right? So that's the only thing I want to make sure that you will be able to do in the future.

54
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:56,120
I mean, if you can, there's a minimum if you can do more than that, I will be super happy, right?

55
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,859
So I'm not going to lie preventing you to kind of like be able to tell me.

56
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:07,670
I mean, I understood everything and everything is very clear. I will be super happy, but but don't feel kind of like intimidated.

57
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:13,550
Okay. It's not really a big deal, but I understand that is not the usual thing that you have seen.

58
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:16,940
Right. Okay. So that was the introduction.

59
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:22,759
So let's go into looking at all the components of total energy expenditure at the individual level.

60
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:35,600
Right. So and this is an expenditure so this is a graph coming from Dr. Willis book and basically this is an example for I for a 70 kilograms male,

61
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:40,210
moderately active in balance and kind of like it is really young.

62
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:47,030
So that should be kind of like eating like 2500 kilocalories but more or less to be in balance, right?

63
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:56,110
So of those 2500 calories, most of it, you know, that goes to the resting metabolic rate, right?

64
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:00,470
So those are the calories that you just need to because you want a life right to be alive.

65
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:06,200
Right. So even when you are kind of like resting, you're still spending energy because I mean,

66
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:12,740
your life, your body needs energy to do to maintain your status and health, right?

67
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,680
So so that's a lot that's like 60%. And clearly that, you know,

68
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:28,999
that that resting metabolic rate actually depends on your kind of like sex age and kind of like in muscle mass and things like that.

69
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,209
Right? So this, this, this can I mean, in terms of sex.

70
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:37,220
And so those are things that you can modify. You can modify your muscle mass, really, but not that easily.

71
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:43,100
Right. So this is something that in a way kind of like you're going to do much about it, right?

72
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:48,650
Then like 10% is different.

73
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:57,080
We're going to give it a foot, which is basically the energy you need to kind of like digest and and and useful, right?

74
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:07,950
Like 30% or so and know that this is kind of like I'm saying 50% because this person is not really active.

75
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:10,279
But if you are sedentary or you are more active,

76
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:16,430
then of course that would change goes to kind of like the physical activity actually this appendage, right.

77
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:21,350
And this is the part where you can kind of modify more easily, right?

78
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:23,839
Because this is the one that you can you can be more sedentary.

79
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:31,249
So that will decrease then that means that you probably will need to have a lower intake in order to be in balance,

80
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:38,930
or you can increase it and then you can have a higher risk. So remember this one because this is very important and then you have this plus -10%,

81
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:45,400
which is the adaptive initiative, which means we want talk about that because that's not target market.

82
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:53,690
Okay. So the idea is that that's that's how their total energy spend that is more or less kind of like classified.

83
00:08:53,690 --> 00:09:00,799
But when you look at populations, the components of the between person variation in energy intake.

84
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:06,900
So when I want to kind of like tick, I mean let's say I want to check this class and then I want to see what I want to

85
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:10,940
do with the components that kind of like provide the between person variation,

86
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:16,790
right? So why, why some people would have a higher energy intake of some people who have a lower energy intake, right?

87
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:25,580
So this is going to first change depending on the population in this study because and some of the components,

88
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:30,290
for example, are body size kind of like will depend on age and sex.

89
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:42,170
But, but kind of like most of the variability is due to up in a like mix of physical activity and metabolic efficiency, right?

90
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,880
So the more physically active you are, the higher is your energy intake, right?

91
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:53,870
And the ideal metabolic efficiency also kind of like with change that now metabolic efficiency,

92
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:57,530
something that you can really measure in population studies.

93
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:02,360
So that's really the bottom line for this. And then you have also kind of like this for tangible on an imbalance.

94
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:11,420
The one line is that most of your what you're measuring in population is studies of your energy intake is actually reflecting your physical activity.

95
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:18,760
So yes. So like with body. Position following your body size or metabolic efficiency?

96
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,909
Virtually. No, this is. Yeah.

97
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:30,190
Well, I mean, yeah, of course. I mean, it's hard to disentangle, but in this situation, men were put in that body size like a kind of like a specify,

98
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:34,930
like, of course, I mean, depending on your sex and your age, you had different requirements for total energy intake.

99
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:40,030
And that's kind of like part of the strange variation that comes with total energy intake that we want to remove.

100
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:45,219
And that way we adjust for totally intake. Did I say so?

101
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:53,840
Like. So does body size also take into account body composition or would that fall far more on your metabolic efficiency?

102
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:59,510
It seems like lean tissue obviously is much more metabolic emissions and that probably will go on.

103
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:03,810
Body composition will go more into metabolic efficiency, but those are things that we're able to measure.

104
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:11,840
Yeah. So body size will be kind of like modeling ethics and kind of like, okay, so then, um,

105
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:22,450
and this is kind of like a sort of thing that I like you to, to do and, and you're probably going to, to me at the end, oh, you just trick us.

106
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:30,870
Okay. So if you think about kind of like an adult female, for example, visually active and young,

107
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:36,190
then it's when it's 2000 kilocalories, if she is to be imbalanced.

108
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:43,740
Right, let's assume that. So if she increases her caloric consumption by 2%, 2%, it's 40 calories extra everyday.

109
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:48,250
And those are kind of like if, for example, half glass of skim milk.

110
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:52,090
So which is nothing like because it's massive.

111
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,320
So what would be the theoretical weight change over ten years?

112
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:06,430
So you assume that all the calories that are kind of like ingesting, although your balance are going to be store,

113
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:13,210
that will be translating to into I mean, your extra calories are stored as fat usually, right?

114
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:19,670
So then you could just kind of like multiplied 2000 like one and two like 365 is.

115
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:24,580
But here like then he has like and then be waiting for ten kilocalories per kilogram of fat.

116
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:31,660
So then that would be like almost £36, which is a wow.

117
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:35,080
Just for how far us and this is ten years. No.

118
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:42,580
Right. So then just kind of like think about if instead of a glass of milk you with a donut which is 175,

119
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:47,910
this is actually not completely true because you know that I mean,

120
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:53,410
it's not that everything that gets ingested, I mean, is going to be added in a linear way.

121
00:12:53,410 --> 00:13:00,570
So then, you know that if you go here, the you know, you give it to body weight planner, you know, kind of like that.

122
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:06,790
There are other things that mean you tend to be in homeostasis as you kind of like increase your your weight.

123
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:14,530
Also your metabolic rate is going to place or and it's not going it won't be as high as it was calculated like it would be much lower.

124
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,379
But as you will be gaining weight. Right.

125
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:25,510
So the bottom line here is that even as small increases in caloric intake over your kind of like usual balance,

126
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:29,680
then eventually will go into increasing weight.

127
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:37,549
And this is what we see with when we ate, right? I mean, when we age, we tend to gain weight unless we are very physically active.

128
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:43,510
We're very careful with our diet. Right. So so that's fine.

129
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:51,399
We are not talking about overweight or gaining weight here, but kind of like the this the bone like here is that those are small,

130
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,700
even small changes in total they can lead to gaining weight.

131
00:13:54,700 --> 00:14:04,420
Right. But long term balance cannot be measured in epidemiological studies by assessment of energy intake and expenditure.

132
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:09,370
So you are not measuring this. I mean, we wish we could, but we can.

133
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:12,799
I mean, to measure that, you need more control, kind of like situation,

134
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:19,060
some more experimental studies where you use your skill and you measure to measure total energy intake.

135
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:22,120
I mean, first remember you are measuring do with a lot of error, right?

136
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:29,199
Because the way that people are kind of like reporting has a lot of error when you measure your physical activity,

137
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:33,009
usually also with questionnaires, sometimes you can measure it with devices.

138
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:38,200
But so I mean, they are they are also measure with a lot of error because I mean,

139
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:42,099
people are not kind of like willing devices all the time and and things like that.

140
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:51,429
Right. So so the idea is that when you're measuring with your nephew, when you measure calories, it actually modulate physical activity.

141
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:58,690
So usually actually calories are usually negatively correlated with obesity because they mostly reflect physical activity.

142
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:06,370
Right. So again, if you see in population studies that total energy intake,

143
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:12,010
high total energy intake is actually protective for things that you see in that issue.

144
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:15,230
Then because you I mean I know that your in your mind saying.

145
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:22,130
If I increase my totality intake, I'm going to gain weight. Gaining weight is going to be associated with chronic disease, right?

146
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:23,630
Well, that's true.

147
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:32,020
But that doesn't work for the data that you're getting because your the data you're getting is more liberally reflecting your physical activity level.

148
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:36,560
So then even you're seeing that high intake of total energy intake.

149
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:43,970
Actually, what it is is probably high physical activity and physical physical activity is actually protective for many chronic diseases.

150
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,920
Right. So eventually, I mean, it will depend on the state population and it will depend on many things.

151
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:52,020
But many times you will see like an inverse relationship. Right.

152
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:59,510
So don't get confused with that because that would be the reason why I'm telling you that is because later we

153
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:05,090
will see an example when we adjust for total energy intake in a manner that will kind of reflect this point.

154
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:11,149
Okay. Any questions? Oh, okay.

155
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:20,300
So now remember, this is the slide that I want you to see and kind of like try to kind of like, you know, put in your mind.

156
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:26,060
Okay. So one of the reasons why just for total energy intake, one,

157
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:31,870
because we want to remove extraneous variation due to body size, metabolic efficiency and so on.

158
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:41,330
Right? I mean, we, I mean, I, I don't want to kind of like have some kind of like predictors,

159
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:49,730
potential predictors of the disease in something in my variables that are not really relevant to what I'm interested in.

160
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:57,230
I'm interested in the diet. I'm not interested in your age or your sex or things that can provide this is because of that.

161
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:03,709
Right. So then I want to remove that. I mean, you're always adjusting your models for age and sex.

162
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:12,320
You know, they term six have potential confounders. So in a way kind of like adjusting for the diet intake also adjusts for age and sex.

163
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,480
I mean you are going to adjust for 18 six again,

164
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:22,370
but kind of remove that extraneous variation that is due to to those kind of lives since not only agencies, of course, body size and all things.

165
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:33,180
Right. So remember, remove extraneous radiation kind of like due to kind of like other variables that are not related to the diet person.

166
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:40,470
Right. Second, totality intake may be a confounder maybe because potentially intake sometimes may be associated,

167
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:47,989
maybe an independent risk factor for the outcome. Right. And actually, depending on the population, maybe positively or negatively associated,

168
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:53,059
if your population is reflecting marginal physical activity will be broadly protective.

169
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,950
Right. But in that case,

170
00:17:54,950 --> 00:18:03,170
then you want to adjust for total energy intake because you don't want kind of like if you are looking at a nutrient analysis of course,

171
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,190
because when you eat a lot, you eat a lot of everything, right?

172
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:10,610
So then all nutrients are going to be associated with total energy intake.

173
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,400
Right. So you don't adjust for the daily intake.

174
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:19,910
Maybe the association that you see between your nutrient and the disease is because of total intake, not because of energy.

175
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:26,610
Right. So one reason to kind of like I just totally to take is because the drink intake may be acting as second fund.

176
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:29,870
Right. And the final one.

177
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:36,680
And then putting this in red, because this is probably the most important one, actually, because we are interested in assessing diet composition.

178
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:41,719
Right. So we most of the time we see in a few examples, maybe not,

179
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:52,240
but most of the times we really want to kind of like make our models resemble like any ISO caloric experiments.

180
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:56,990
So then you think about ISO caloric experiments when you do feeding trials,

181
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:04,549
imagine that you are kind of like because I mean kind of like wondering if a

182
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:11,690
diet low in carbohydrates is better than a diet low in fat for losing weight.

183
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,140
Right.

184
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:22,729
So when you assign people to the diet, right, you are not going to kind of like you're going to fix the total energy intake to one side or the other.

185
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:22,969
Right.

186
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:34,120
Because if kind of like in the low carbohydrate diet, I'm eating less calories than in the low fat diet, then those are not comparable because I mean,

187
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:41,150
no comparing the low fat versus low carb any more and occupying more more calories and doing it with less calories.

188
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:46,790
And you know, which, of course, I mean, more calories. Well, we'll have to wait.

189
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:50,090
Right. So our models want to be like that.

190
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,639
I mean, you want to make sure that you fixed calories.

191
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:59,090
You are going to give your people the same amount of calories when in the low fat and the same amount of calories when in the in the low carb.

192
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:05,880
I mean, the calories that you need to have got, I mean, depending on your individual level, but they have to be the same.

193
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:10,070
Right. So that way I can compare it. Low carb works better than low fat.

194
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:14,390
Right. So this is the one of the key.

195
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:18,710
Issues for digestive or dietary intake in additionally being.

196
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:25,000
We are interested in assessing that composition. We want to kind of like do ISO caloric models.

197
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:33,430
Okay. So this is one of the most important slice of the to this.

198
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:40,840
Okay. So now do we have to adjust always for totally intake?

199
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:52,010
No, sometimes. I mean, I will we will talk about other samples next week, but one of the samples that we don't need to is here my first sample.

200
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:55,810
Well, you are thinking about the kind of like biological point of view.

201
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:02,480
If another injury study, the study is metabolized or consumed in proportion to total intake.

202
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:06,220
You really want to adjust, right? Because you want the study and then you competition.

203
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:13,590
But you did have specific requirements for for effort on an organic for example,

204
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:18,120
I don't requirement is to prevent anemia then you don't want to adjust because those are kind of like you.

205
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:21,700
You will use the nutrients and observe intake.

206
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:30,710
Okay. Because you in that situation, you really have your requirements are specified in kind of like serving RDA or something like that.

207
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:38,530
So for for many kind of like macronutrients that you really want to see if it's kind of like this is this is something

208
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:44,830
in the sample is like item to prevent anemia is a certain amount and then you don't want to adjust for that.

209
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:52,240
So that would be one of the few examples in which you don't want to adjust for totally, because most of the times you want to adjust.

210
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:57,100
Right. And also, there are reasons, family health reasons to adjust.

211
00:21:57,310 --> 00:22:03,250
And it's because of the recommendations, because you think about the recommendations, the dietary recommendations.

212
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:06,360
The dietary guidelines are made relative to total gradient.

213
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:12,850
They I mean, people are not telling you have to 800 grams of fat or 20 grams of protein or whatever.

214
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:18,979
Right. Just making up those amounts from the top of my head, which are wrong, of course.

215
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:26,620
But people have said kind of like you have to maybe eat less than 30% of fat.

216
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:30,190
Right. Or 50% of protein or whatever.

217
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:33,970
Right. So those are given in percentages from total energy intake.

218
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:40,530
Right. So then that's another reason why we usually test for total.

219
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:49,110
Okay. So the other thing that you when I'm telling you that, oh,

220
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:55,299
some micronutrients that have a specific requirements, one need to be adjusted in other situations.

221
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:59,170
That doesn't mean that all micronutrients that you have to address,

222
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:03,100
I mean some other things you may need to address because they are not kind of

223
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:08,469
like a specific in terms of I need this amount for this particular outcome,

224
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:13,970
right? So and there are some micro things you may study to see how they kind of like

225
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:18,910
relate to other outcomes and you can still adjust for the calorie intake there.

226
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:25,330
You may be wondering where, but micronutrients don't contribute total calories, right?

227
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:29,710
I mean, the contribution of total calories from macronutrient and micronutrients, right?

228
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:38,020
Yes, you're right. But even those that don't contribute to that are calories are correlated with total energy intake.

229
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:47,970
All nutrients are correlated with total energy intake just for the fact that if you eat more, you eat more of everything right now.

230
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:52,929
Me Think about that, right? If I eat more, then clearly I'm eating more of everything.

231
00:23:52,930 --> 00:24:00,250
And also the macronutrients that I'm eating will be a higher amount than democratic that someone with a lower total energy intake.

232
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:08,710
Right. Because I mean, they are eating less. Right. And of course, the correlations are going to be much higher for the macronutrients.

233
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:16,600
This is really vital because some of my minutes and then you can see the correlation of protein with the battery index point 86,

234
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:23,469
this is a high correlation so that 5.88 carbohydrates but anything that when you look at things

235
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:31,720
that don't contribute to that but only take five or four samples point 71 is still pretty high.

236
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:38,080
Now vitamin C a lack of clearly the correlation is going to be lower, but still is not negligible at this point.

237
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:44,829
44.57. That means that they felt that that energy intake may be confounding the association.

238
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:47,020
Right. Because of that correlation? Yes.

239
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:54,910
Is it I mean, I feel like this would be definitely applicable in like epidemiological studies where you're looking at a population size.

240
00:24:54,910 --> 00:25:04,500
But like for instance, if you had like a vegan who's gaining a lot of calories versus someone is giving me,

241
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:09,790
but eating very few calories like the B12 is still going to be higher for the

242
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:13,930
lower person and cholesterol is also going to be higher for the person to handle.

243
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:20,860
Yeah, but we are not thinking about specific. I know you're right, but not any specific examples of kind of like different days.

244
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:24,070
I mean we're having more the global picture that in general.

245
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:32,229
Yeah. And you know, I, I mean we're not going to have like but there are individual there are individual cases in that this may not hold.

246
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:38,230
Yeah, definitely. But in general it will. Okay.

247
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:41,410
So those are the methods. And then I put them all together.

248
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:44,739
So then you can see it's not I'm going to go one by one.

249
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:49,120
Right. And I told you the good ones are the not so good ones.

250
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:52,959
Okay, so then not all of them. And then at the end I will tell you these ones, please.

251
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:58,720
No, these ones, please. This. Okay. So then the first one we're going to see is the nutrient density model,

252
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:03,040
which basically we just divide neutering by calories, which is something we do a lot.

253
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:07,239
Right. We do kind of like those percentage of macronutrients the way we do that.

254
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:10,870
Right? The second one is going to be the second.

255
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:16,359
And the third one actually is the same because they will see the US, we will see what the receiver, you know, the you know,

256
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:26,469
whatever is when you have a negative issue that I similar we may be very happy that is not explained by the by the regression line.

257
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:35,860
Right. We have to question the one in which you use only that receiver or the one in which you say that the receiver will enter calories.

258
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:44,230
And then okay, then we have the standard would be very similar, which is one that probably you have in mind because it's like,

259
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:48,459
wait a minute, you're telling me that we have to adjust for total intake then?

260
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:51,820
Okay, I will just put totally in my model and that's it, right?

261
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:57,190
That's what we been doing so far. When you have a variable, you want to adjust for it, you just put it in the model.

262
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:03,760
So is there anything wrong with that? No, there's nothing wrong with that because I mean, you maybe one.

263
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:08,200
Why should I learn new methods? If I can just do this right?

264
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:14,830
What would see why? I mean, there are some disadvantages of this model is not wrong, but there are some about it.

265
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:22,780
And then we have this other model which actually is one of the bad ones, which is the energy of the competition model,

266
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:29,860
which basically you adjust for the calories from the nutrient and the calories for the remaining nutrients.

267
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:36,610
And we'll see that this is a good one in no way. But it helps you to understand some of the other things that we see now.

268
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:39,850
Finally, we have this other model which is similar to the French one.

269
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:46,540
So we'll use a nuclear density, but we also add calories in the model.

270
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:53,320
So this is a multivariate nutrient density. Okay, so let's let's look at all of them there.

271
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:58,240
So let's start with the first one. So this is the nutrient density model.

272
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:00,310
So this is the model, right?

273
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:09,460
So this is when I put one here, I put any outcome and the studying and this is best I mean necessarily that this has to be linear regression.

274
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:16,960
I'm just not adding like a link or whatever. This could be like a binary outcome and this could be a logistic regression or could be whatever, right?

275
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:21,100
So does this is the outcome and whole looking because I'm looking at kind of

276
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:26,290
like the association of between a nutrient and any disease or any outcome,

277
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:32,320
right? So, so these variables here, we will know place divided by calories.

278
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:38,550
No decisions will be made. I will see if there is an association between my nutrients and my right.

279
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:47,980
So in this situation, we have this table in which you can see that these are age adjusted means of

280
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:51,969
crude nutrient intakes and nutrient intakes as a percentage of total calories.

281
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:57,040
So basically we have this absolute kind of like nutrients this person drops, right?

282
00:28:57,340 --> 00:29:01,530
And this expresses a percentage of calories means is processed nutrient basically.

283
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:05,320
Right. So then and then you have kind of like.

284
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:14,800
These are kind of like, am I or I have this is there.

285
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:22,840
I mean, these are people who did not have the the the they they were free of this is right.

286
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:31,899
So so the first thing that you may notice here here is clearly because it says that here you have others

287
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:40,900
and then you see that salaries are like 2300 in the in the controls and 2100 in the in the cases.

288
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:47,170
The people who are poor who had gone I had this is either acute or they they die.

289
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:51,280
So is that something that kind of like, um,

290
00:29:52,690 --> 00:30:00,129
and this is statistically significant you can see that is lower in the cases than in the controls and is significant.

291
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:12,470
Is that something that you were expecting? The energy, the difference.

292
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:19,080
Yeah, that is low, though. Yeah. Is that something that has got to the.

293
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:23,340
Exactly. See, I mean, if I didn't tell you anything, but I.

294
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:26,600
You would be thinking that doesn't look like. Okay.

295
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:32,659
Right. I mean, you would you always kind of like tend to attribute kind of like but seems to calories, right?

296
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:37,670
It's kind of like not too many calories. Probably not good for you because you will be gaining weight and then they're going to.

297
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:37,970
Right.

298
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:45,080
Or you will be kind of like, depending on the calories, the quality, the colors, maybe that's not good for your insulin sensitivity or whatever.

299
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:49,730
A higher percentage of that, a positive you would result in a lower BMR, so.

300
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:53,390
Yeah, that's true. Yeah. So anyway, so yeah.

301
00:30:53,510 --> 00:31:01,100
So this is suspected in a way because this is kind of like showing is that this group is probably more physically active.

302
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:04,909
That's why they are having a higher intake. And then if you are physically active,

303
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:11,209
definitely physical activity is a protective factor for coronary heart disease that is actually going in this direction.

304
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:16,850
As long as you assume that would you are measuring we are calories is a proxy of your physical activity.

305
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:23,120
Okay. That is shouldn't be, you know, in other settings.

306
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:27,709
You know, I mean because this is assuming that that people are in balance and fine.

307
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:32,810
Right but but it shouldn't be. So I'm not saying that calories more calories are always better.

308
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:38,750
Right. How many more calories is because you are just eating more by doing physical activity than is not necessary.

309
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:49,640
Right. Right. Okay. So so now you have many things here that are not significant and absolute that you see that the differences are significant.

310
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:55,460
But the moment that you adjust for total energy intake, you divide by total calories.

311
00:31:55,790 --> 00:32:02,890
Then you can see that there are differences here. Right. So these things are going to be higher in the cases and lower in the contrast.

312
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:06,959
Statistically significant. So. So what do you think about that?

313
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:13,550
So you think that really kind of like total protein, total fat,

314
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:23,360
total saturated fat mono and that it you think that those are those factors for going to how this

315
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:33,980
is because they are higher like in the in my case than the controls on one center and that is.

316
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:39,790
But. I wouldn't I wouldn't associate one.

317
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:48,410
Yeah, right. How broadly done will definitely support you?

318
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:51,760
In fact, I do think for instance, out here.

319
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:57,590
And one would probably indicate larger consumption,

320
00:32:57,590 --> 00:33:09,530
like the saturated fat and protein altogether higher consumption and food consumption or equivalent with the visible protein plant,

321
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:12,640
plant based protein that I have to the animal protein. I mean, you're right.

322
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:15,650
I mean, it's a paradox, in fact, that all three of them are elevated.

323
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:23,239
Like it's just more likely, but never, you know, I mean, this very solid protein, what if it's plant based protein?

324
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:32,360
And that can be seen in India, which I mean, there are so many vegetarians, regardless of projects, are suggesting that you have one inflammation.

325
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:37,879
Oh, yeah. Okay. But there are a few that you're not expecting, right?

326
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:40,990
I mean, if putting them on the menu is not going in the right direction.

327
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:47,780
So what's going on here? And they were not associated in their absolute kind of like.

328
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:08,640
Oh. Next slide. So that was it.

329
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:12,150
So what happened with nutrient dense density?

330
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:17,280
Is that what we are actually doing is that we are dividing by calories.

331
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:21,570
So there are ways like we are multiplying by the inverse of total caloric intake.

332
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:26,000
So when we do a nutrient density model, a simple in the city model,

333
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:32,430
actually we are not really adjusting well for calories because what happened is that nutrient densities

334
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:37,770
are going to be associated with this is in the opposite direction to that of total calorie intake,

335
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:47,329
which is what happened here. Right. So we. So here. The galleries were no peer galleries.

336
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:53,180
What have I here? So the moment that would be like all these things and these things were not different by the woman that you would be like.

337
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:58,520
Those things were totally evident. They then these differences and because of these differences.

338
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:06,320
So it's not only that we are not destiny for the day, but we are messing up even more.

339
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:11,170
Right. Because I mean, we are creating associations that are parolees for years that are not.

340
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:15,820
I mean, some of those situations may make sense, like the sedative or the protein escape, he said.

341
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,950
But others didn't make sense, right?

342
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:27,820
So then what happen is that basically dividing a variable does not necessarily remove or control for the effect of that variable.

343
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:31,840
So this is one of those models that you should not use.

344
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:38,170
Okay. So don't use. But I want to start with this one because.

345
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:44,750
It looks very reasonable. Right. So it's something like, oh yeah.

346
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:50,450
I just kind of like derive an intake and then it would be enough. Well, it looks reasonable, but it is actually not correct.

347
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:58,730
Right. Now another issue is that when on top of that you enter also calories in the model,

348
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:06,620
which is the last one that we will see that the be very nutrient, that one is fine because then you're fixing calories and then that's fine.

349
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:12,310
We will see that later. Any questions?

350
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:20,589
Okay. So let's go into the results because for the rest, you guys, we need to we have these two, right?

351
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:27,240
We have the ones where we probably get to that and the ones where we also enter calories in them on.

352
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:32,870
So remember your generation, right?

353
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:39,080
So you have basically you have two continuous variables and you're just kind of like feeding a line, right?

354
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:43,550
And the way that you feed a line is using that list discourse criterion.

355
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:51,260
Remember that basically what you're trying to do is to minimize the sum of a slice of this vertical variation threshold.

356
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:53,840
I think kind of like best feeding model, right?

357
00:36:54,110 --> 00:37:03,020
And maybe these are when you look at that, you have to think about, let's say that this is the nutrient and these are kind of like the cows, right?

358
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:07,790
So then we know that nutrient and the alternatives are associated with calories, right?

359
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:13,220
So they will be correlated. So then they can kind of like also run animal relation with it.

360
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:18,740
Sure. It's one of the other times we did it, but it's so important this amount of calories.

361
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:28,799
This is the amount of nutrition that I have right now for this amount of calories, this amount of noting that I have not more than that.

362
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:34,860
But the sense here would be that for this amount of calories,

363
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:42,480
this is the amount of the nutrient predicted by the model created by the length and the meaning,

364
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:48,390
which is the receiver is the part that the model does not predict.

365
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:52,950
So it's the part that is independent of total energy intake, right?

366
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:56,610
So it's kind of like you have to think about like this is true, but this is a very key part,

367
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:03,090
which is the one I want to remove because that's the part that is associated with calories but created by calories.

368
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:09,240
And this is the part that I want to keep because it is the part that is independent of calories.

369
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:17,040
Okay. All of these receive us. And I know it sounds like a little weird because it's like usually you think about risk versus lot, right?

370
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:26,850
But in this situation, those errors actually are errors that are the variability that is not explained by total energy intake.

371
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:34,590
And this is the variability that we want to keep. We want to get rid of the one that is as plain better than any intake.

372
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:39,120
And we want to keep that one. That is not explain the one that is not explaining the receipt loss.

373
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:42,090
So that's that's what the model is doing. Okay.

374
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:53,660
So but it has some kind of like since first the regional distribution is kind of like meaningless, right?

375
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:56,990
Because remember, it has positive and negative values.

376
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:06,840
Right? So it's kind of like you have like a nutrient that is expressed in grams per day with a mean and the standard deviation that you can recognize.

377
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:15,080
Right. And then suddenly what you get out of kind of like your the ratio model to get those received loss

378
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:22,920
is something that is minus positive and kind of like in some numbers that you don't recognize.

379
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:29,490
Right. So then when we what we usually do is that, by the way, what do.

380
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:41,070
I received less. She'll be not releasing that because that's one of the assumptions would be another vision.

381
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:50,400
Right. So in theory, the distribution should be kind of like maybe zero and maybe what happened here was a few letters.

382
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:52,980
Right. So which is perfectly fine.

383
00:39:52,980 --> 00:40:00,240
So this distribution of the nutrients that are seedless is kind of like we are looking at the beta inversion variation,

384
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:03,480
you know, population independent of together. Right.

385
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:09,030
So but these numbers are not nice to report because they are not information.

386
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:16,430
So then what we are going to do is that we are going to kind of like I'm going to try

387
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:21,389
to do this is to reassure which will be respected nutrient intake for our person,

388
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:32,700
which I mean caloric intake so that we will I will worry about want because that may help to avoid further loss of ideas that we know kind

389
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:44,970
of like more of this distribution system that kind of like perspective and I don't some them be usual being for protein is 20 grams.

390
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:51,950
I'm sorry to hear that. So imagine that, I guess, some 60 events to everyone.

391
00:40:52,070 --> 00:41:03,130
Right. So then now I'm going to have women here and then others here in the marketplace.

392
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:07,310
So I guess we sending to you. I'm not changing anything.

393
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:12,680
There is a kind of like the differences between people and exactly the same here, not here.

394
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:18,500
The only thing I'm presenting so that when I describe this, it makes more sense.

395
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:22,510
Okay. So but I'm not doing I mean, I'm not doing anything.

396
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:26,750
It looks like just moving the distribution to the right.

397
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:39,410
Okay. So that's what we are doing. So how to calculate the residuals?

398
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:49,290
I already told you some of this. You run a linear regression in which the dependent variable of your music.

399
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:57,110
So this is your opportunity. I mean, the benevolent always comes back, Minister, and then assuming that it's going to be linearly related.

400
00:41:57,260 --> 00:42:02,450
Right. So the more calories you consume, the more of that laundry you consume.

401
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:07,160
And that will be valid for for some notice. That would be very tight.

402
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:11,120
Like, remember, fat, like carbohydrates and they fall.

403
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:18,860
And the protein, the macro dance, they are highly correlated. So this line is going to be really kind of like well predicted impact.

404
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:22,940
I mean, they are highly correlated for all their nutrients, like fiber or whatever.

405
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:30,160
I mean, it will be like of being like I put in the sample, it will be more kind of like whatever, right?

406
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:40,040
Not mostly. We want the idea to do that is to remove that kind of like the energy intake from the variability in energy.

407
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:45,030
Okay. So then we do that and we take the receiver from the information.

408
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:47,600
I mean, what we really care about in the relation to the receiver.

409
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:53,300
So that's, that's, that's our new nutrient, the one that is independent of total energy intake, right?

410
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:58,070
Because obviously those are positive or negative and they don't make a lot of sense.

411
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:04,909
They are hard to interpret. We are going to add the expected nutrient in big for a person with a mean caloric intake.

412
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:09,390
So then what we will do is that we will look at it in. That will be study dependent.

413
00:43:09,410 --> 00:43:13,700
We will go to study population. We say, what are the mean, calorie intake?

414
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:19,910
And then knowing the mean calorie intake, we have the choice of either of these regression.

415
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:27,709
They will guide us Bloody Sunday. We will have the expected nutrient eating right because the spectrum nutrient is

416
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:32,420
that imagine we will have the vehicle index and then using this element is better.

417
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:37,190
I can get this because the spectrum of an MP may mean a spectrum.

418
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:45,140
So I'm just basically adding Boston to the whole distribution to receptor distribution.

419
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:53,090
Okay. So so. Okay.

420
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:56,990
Now let's add another layer of complexity.

421
00:43:57,770 --> 00:44:04,970
What if we need transformations? Because, remember, nutrients are generally not normally distributed, right?

422
00:44:05,450 --> 00:44:09,270
And then linear regression is very sensitive to model assumptions.

423
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:17,690
It's very sensitive to departures from normality. It's also very kind of like sensitive to the constant variance.

424
00:44:17,690 --> 00:44:20,780
And I'm not sure if you remember the assumptions of the innovation.

425
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:29,830
Those are the two main ones that we have to be aware of, the normality and the and this I never I don't even try to say these name this.

426
00:44:30,410 --> 00:44:34,040
He did this. It is the same as constant variance.

427
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:39,320
So we are assuming that we have constant virus and with no trends that are highly skilled.

428
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:42,640
Both they know the number of the calories this may not hot.

429
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:50,780
Okay. So then many times you need to kind of like transform the nutrition and the calories do not.

430
00:44:51,260 --> 00:45:01,130
But if you transform the calories, it's not necessarily because of normality, because normality affects the dependent variable and the receipt.

431
00:45:01,310 --> 00:45:04,670
Right. But calories help with the constant variance.

432
00:45:05,630 --> 00:45:09,980
Right. So then we have the lovely no gain intake.

433
00:45:10,370 --> 00:45:17,320
The linear version would be able to plan given that low calories we get the same receive goes from here.

434
00:45:17,330 --> 00:45:25,460
Right. But if we want to kind of like move the distribution of we that we will have to do some back transformation.

435
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:30,890
Okay. Because this is in the low scale. So we have to kind of like use that explanation function, right?

436
00:45:31,310 --> 00:45:34,970
So we have to take that below before. And they kind of like.

437
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:44,570
So then I, I'll show you this in the lab. So what is it? Is there, same as there is, that we also have to add an exponential function.

438
00:45:44,690 --> 00:45:48,259
Okay. But I'll. I'll give you there. I'll show you the code and I'll give you that.

439
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:59,030
Gotcha. The more the what I want you to kind of like understand here is just the concept that the results are fine, there's nothing wrong with them.

440
00:45:59,030 --> 00:46:09,530
But if you want to describe them, like let's say that you have your table one and you want to show adjusted nutrition using the receiver methods,

441
00:46:09,890 --> 00:46:15,990
you cannot put the mean and the standard deviation of the received one because it will be zero or minor or something.

442
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:23,180
No, I mean, it doesn't make any sense. So in order for people to really say, okay, makes sense, you have to do that center.

443
00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:28,300
Okay. And that's something gets a little more complicated when you have to log transfer.

444
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:32,630
Right. Just a little bit. Not not not too much. Just that you have to take into account that.

445
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:37,360
Okay. Okay.

446
00:46:38,350 --> 00:46:41,950
So far, so good. That was the most difficult one. So.

447
00:46:43,810 --> 00:46:52,960
So now you're probably going to libel to this day and then you're thinking,

448
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:59,079
but y y y kind of we just use the standard multivariate model that we have use always.

449
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:02,170
Y y I mean, what's wrong with that model? There's nothing wrong with that.

450
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:06,219
We have our little bit and we just are calories in the model. Right. And that's true.

451
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:12,430
There's nothing wrong with that model. You could do that. Right. So there's only a couple of problems with that model.

452
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:23,760
One is that. Barack is going to kind of like represent the same as in previous model is kind of like the change in

453
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:28,470
the in the outcome they're kind of like unique changing the notion right so that special effects.

454
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:36,180
But what if you are also interested in interpreting total energy intake because for your outcome is important.

455
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:42,030
So what that basically represents here, that will represent total energy intake.

456
00:47:46,510 --> 00:47:58,089
Actually, no. Which is the only issue with this model in this situation basically represent the calories independent of the nutrient.

457
00:47:58,090 --> 00:48:04,239
He's not really telling you why, because you're fixing the nutrient. So it's kind of like everything when you enter things.

458
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:10,450
In our model, the other betas, you have to interpret thinking that you're fixing the other things.

459
00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:15,640
Right. And in the case of diet, because when you're fixing HD, a perfectly fine.

460
00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:20,050
Okay. I'm just weeks in nature and weeks and sex or whatever. Right. I mean, you you are used to that.

461
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:27,420
But in in diet, when you're fixing things, then you're completely changing the way that that the better represents something.

462
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:36,490
So in this situation, imagine that your nutrition is fat, so that now obesity will represent the calories from protein and carbohydrate.

463
00:48:36,670 --> 00:48:40,360
So the calories that are not the nutrient.

464
00:48:40,630 --> 00:48:44,800
Okay. Which is kind of like. There's nothing wrong with that.

465
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:48,640
That's perfectly fine. You can still use this model. If you don't get about calories, then that's fine.

466
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:55,359
But if you want to interpret calories, then you've got to use this model because the interpretation of that data is not the

467
00:48:55,360 --> 00:49:00,110
interpretation of total calories is interpretation of the calories other than the nutrient.

468
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:04,040
Okay. Yes.

469
00:49:04,830 --> 00:49:13,710
So that would be all of the nutrients and the data set that like if there's protein and carbohydrates and vitamin A and we'd be like,

470
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:17,220
no, no, it will be the ones like there micrometers and ones that contribute.

471
00:49:17,430 --> 00:49:23,340
Yeah. So actually that's a good point because if you your nutrient is micronutrient that don't contribute.

472
00:49:23,370 --> 00:49:24,120
That's a great point.

473
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:30,920
Yeah, I forgot to say that because your nutrients in that is not contributing to calories and basically that we would be calories.

474
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:34,560
Right. Yeah. So this is kind of like this is important for them model.

475
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,770
They want to contribute to calories. Okay.

476
00:49:38,610 --> 00:49:46,290
The other problem that sometimes these add more than half is that now we are talking about using only one nutrient, which is perfectly fine.

477
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:50,190
But what if you want to have more nutrients in your model?

478
00:49:50,190 --> 00:49:55,229
What do you want to have? Like for example, qualified mono fat,

479
00:49:55,230 --> 00:50:04,170
certified fat of protein and different type of protein or different types of carbohydrate or things like that because they are highly correlated,

480
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:07,980
then you may end up with more motorcycle inherited problems,

481
00:50:08,850 --> 00:50:13,460
which you will have with a kind of let me see what some of you I mean you're still going to have these

482
00:50:13,470 --> 00:50:17,940
are getting at the problem you put many nutrients but you will have more problems with this model.

483
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:22,229
And I don't feel that these are not this is not a role model.

484
00:50:22,230 --> 00:50:25,920
This family just has this too inconvenient.

485
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:30,180
Okay. So you can use this model as long as you are aware of those two things.

486
00:50:30,330 --> 00:50:38,230
Okay. Okay. And then I'm going to go very quickly on the last two models, because I want to give you a break.

487
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:44,379
So. This model is a will,

488
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:49,870
one that hopefully you see in the literature because I don't want is this is the energy partition method in

489
00:50:49,870 --> 00:50:56,950
which basically you put the calories from the nutrient and then you put the calories for other nutrients.

490
00:50:57,460 --> 00:51:02,050
So the huge problem of this model is that this is not an actual metric model.

491
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:06,820
Everything we saw so far, they are still caloric models.

492
00:51:07,150 --> 00:51:11,760
Okay. So we are all all the models that we saw until this one there I saw caloric.

493
00:51:11,770 --> 00:51:14,650
We are kind of like fixing calories one way or the other.

494
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:22,360
And then that means that kind of is a good model because remember, what we want in our models is to reflect like an experiment.

495
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:28,930
This one is not because basically kind of like in fact, we seen the calories from the nutrient,

496
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:34,380
like the calories from the other nutrients can kind of like change independent of kind of like that

497
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:38,520
young office in total calories actually increasing kind of like the calories of one or the other.

498
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:45,530
So not not totally. So this is another good one. So this that means that if you are not fixing calories and if so caloric,

499
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:51,010
you know, the answer is going to still be confounded by totally the intake ratio.

500
00:51:51,010 --> 00:51:58,210
Then you are not kind of like, you know, helping with one of the problems of adjusting for totally.

501
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:05,140
And finally also, I mean, you can use it for nutrients that don't contribute to calories, right?

502
00:52:05,150 --> 00:52:09,120
So you cannot use this model in your way for macromolecules.

503
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:13,420
So the one that you. Right.

504
00:52:16,030 --> 00:52:25,030
And finally, the one that I hinted at the beginning, if you want to use nutrient densities, that's fine.

505
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:32,050
But you cannot use and then there's this other you have to enter the calories in the model to make it so caloric.

506
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:37,660
Okay. Well, I'm sorry. When I told that all the models before what I saw, the first one was not.

507
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:47,090
So they nutrient density kind of like is it not is kind of like not controlling well for totally and then but this one is that's good today.

508
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:57,940
And this one has also the advantage over the standard multivariate that the data from calories represent naturally and the effect of total calories,

509
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:00,540
which happens the same in the receiver. Okay.

510
00:53:00,550 --> 00:53:11,140
So the received was and these multivariate neutrality model, the calories represent calories in the standard multivariate is still a caloric model,

511
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:18,120
but the data from the calories don't represent that represent total calories, 4% calories all that one minute.

512
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:21,430
Okay. There's one sort of advantages.

513
00:53:21,430 --> 00:53:23,830
One one that issues with body size.

514
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:33,250
Well, body size varies greatly, which is not a major issue in humans is, for example, we do have starving dogs that have a huge variation in size.

515
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:39,030
Then maybe this is this is convenient. Okay.

516
00:53:39,030 --> 00:53:43,140
So this is one example of the multivariate model in the city model.

517
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:50,610
And in this situation, basically what they are doing, they are looking at different types of fat and they may and it doesn't matter.

518
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:54,220
So what I want to show you is their model. So the model we are looking at.

519
00:53:54,960 --> 00:54:01,710
This is a low risk model. And then the model basically is looking at saturated fat, mono body,

520
00:54:02,070 --> 00:54:06,780
trans protein, and then it has got a number that it has all the components, right?

521
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:12,930
So then basically what I'm doing here, this is such to help model what we call a distribution model.

522
00:54:12,930 --> 00:54:18,240
And this is used a lot in the scenario B because you put all the nutrients

523
00:54:18,690 --> 00:54:24,120
that contribute to total calories except for one that you keep at the end of,

524
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:27,600
like I'll say, the model, and then you enter total calories too.

525
00:54:27,870 --> 00:54:36,600
And then this is like what you do with your dummy variables, remember, with your dummy variables that you leave the reference outside the model.

526
00:54:37,530 --> 00:54:42,720
And then the interpretation of every letter is in reference to the one that you leave outside.

527
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:52,239
So this is similar. So if I leave carbohydrates outside of the model with the rotation of every bit of this in relation to carbohydrates.

528
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:57,540
So then for example, before will be the effect of substituting transport carbohydrates.

529
00:54:58,110 --> 00:55:02,849
B two will be the effect of three months and maybe 40 for carbohydrates and so on.

530
00:55:02,850 --> 00:55:06,209
So the carbohydrates is the reference here, and you can change that.

531
00:55:06,210 --> 00:55:12,720
If you don't want to have this to be the reference, you will put carbohydrates in the model and then you will take something out,

532
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:17,130
for example, protein, for example, saturated fat, whatever you're interested in.

533
00:55:17,430 --> 00:55:20,700
So this is this is going to be used in the city model,

534
00:55:21,090 --> 00:55:25,890
but they are also doing this institution model because they leave out of the model the reference.

535
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:29,580
Okay. So this is you will see this model in the literature a lot.

536
00:55:31,110 --> 00:55:37,920
Okay. So bottom line, which method should you use?

537
00:55:39,590 --> 00:55:44,760
No, no, no, no, no. Never, never. Nutrient density salon or dietitian method.

538
00:55:44,790 --> 00:55:48,000
Those two. Forget about those. No. Yes.

539
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:53,129
The receiver method with or without calories. The standard multivariate you can use.

540
00:55:53,130 --> 00:56:00,920
But I put the was your master. Then you are a of the interpretation but you can do it is fine and then multivariate nutrient their

541
00:56:00,930 --> 00:56:07,020
city model right so these three models are ISO caloric they perfectly ISO caloric so they are good.

542
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:11,360
Which one is more popular in the field? Oh, I don't know.

543
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:17,490
Things change a lot, but I think probably the rational method and the multivariate intensity are used a lot.

544
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:22,650
But many people use is still the standard. So you can use either of all of them.

545
00:56:22,710 --> 00:56:27,300
Okay. Okay. So one less thing.

546
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:36,310
Sorry. And I think this is just to remind you that when we are studying, this is kind of like nutrition.

547
00:56:36,330 --> 00:56:41,370
This is associations we get about total energy intake because of removing extraneous

548
00:56:41,370 --> 00:56:46,349
radiation confounding and compositions then quality but also in the context.

549
00:56:46,350 --> 00:56:55,079
And remember we saw that in the previous way in the contents of value of adding food frequency questionnaires, adjusting for energy intake.

550
00:56:55,080 --> 00:57:03,000
And I asked about that in, in the first one word remember have with decreasing a stress between person medication and help to compensate for error.

551
00:57:03,150 --> 00:57:10,650
Okay. Should remember that too because there may be a couple of questions in there and they will have about that.

552
00:57:11,370 --> 00:57:24,449
Okay. So conclusion as so caloric analysis where you adjust for total intake should be conducted in almost all epidemiological studies.

553
00:57:24,450 --> 00:57:31,530
Not always. We will see some examples we saw already set the absolute when you need the idea and think that that no.

554
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:36,110
Now we will see more examples next week but but most of the times we have to

555
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:40,880
write and to tackle intake is very important in the addition of alternative.

556
00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:43,590
So then definitely you have to measure.

557
00:57:44,250 --> 00:57:55,080
Okay, so let's take a break brief because there was a lot of information and then we'll go back and start with a lab.

558
00:57:55,170 --> 00:58:28,190
Okay. You could only.

559
00:58:48,490 --> 00:58:52,530
You. Know.

560
01:00:18,020 --> 01:00:26,090
Oh, she. You know, you your.

561
01:00:30,610 --> 01:00:37,670
Go away. But more.

562
01:00:39,700 --> 01:01:13,170
And. True to form.

563
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:39,680
How? So.

564
01:03:05,450 --> 01:04:03,250
I'm. John.

565
01:05:43,580 --> 01:05:46,760
Okay. Let's go back to business. Okay.

566
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:53,570
So for the lab where I told you about all this metaphor for the lab, we are going to use only this tool.

567
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:58,370
Okay. So then we see the US with colors in the model and the standard multivariate.

568
01:05:58,650 --> 01:06:05,690
Okay, so. So, so this is how you calculate the receivers.

569
01:06:05,690 --> 01:06:08,900
I already kind of like told you about that.

570
01:06:09,020 --> 01:06:17,809
Right. And then we are going to kind of like look at the look at the lab and then we are going to work together.

571
01:06:17,810 --> 01:06:22,490
So then everything is clear. So that part one, there are two parts here.

572
01:06:22,490 --> 01:06:29,110
The part one, we are going to adjust for calories using the residual method to validate nutrient questions.

573
01:06:29,510 --> 01:06:35,930
Okay. So remember that we've been validating nutrient questionnaires already in their first homework.

574
01:06:36,290 --> 01:06:42,830
Now we are going to do it, but we're going to do something a little better with it, which is adjusting for total energy intake.

575
01:06:42,860 --> 01:06:49,879
Now that we know how to do that with the regular method, we're going to do that because we already know that when we adjust for total energy intake,

576
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:55,130
the nutrients from the 24 hour recalls and from the if you then the correlations are much higher

577
01:06:55,130 --> 01:06:59,810
because we are removing extra variation and because we are kind of like canceling out errors.

578
01:06:59,930 --> 01:07:05,540
Right. So that's the purpose of doing this. So we're going to use are all there said validation.

579
01:07:05,540 --> 01:07:15,469
You have used that before and then we are going to use the residues to calculate calorie adjusted nutrient intake for the day of recall.

580
01:07:15,470 --> 01:07:21,590
And the full frequency question for both. Right. And we're going to do that for four nutrients, for total fat.

581
01:07:21,590 --> 01:07:24,880
We're going to hydrate protein and cholesterol. Okay.

582
01:07:24,890 --> 01:07:31,490
So and because if you are going to have to do that eight times, right, so eight linear regression models.

583
01:07:32,060 --> 01:07:39,350
So now the first thing that you have to do in this lab is that you have to create calories because calories is not in that direction.

584
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:45,829
Right. So so that's their way of creating calories for a few.

585
01:07:45,830 --> 01:07:50,140
And you will have to do the same for for the diet breakfast.

586
01:07:50,150 --> 01:07:56,000
Right. So basically what you do is that you motivate you take the calories from the fuel for the

587
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:03,440
day for four because four calories is what one gram of protein has right there by nine.

588
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:08,630
Right. Because we know that one gram of fat calories and because we're headed by four.

589
01:08:08,780 --> 01:08:12,230
Okay, so that way you have more or less.

590
01:08:12,590 --> 01:08:16,430
But that I mean, we are not including alcohol here because we don't have alcohol.

591
01:08:16,430 --> 01:08:21,440
Right. But but in theory, those are the three main components of total energy.

592
01:08:21,590 --> 01:08:26,480
But then you have to love transport.

593
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:36,080
And even though I told you before that you have to check the distributions and

594
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:42,490
everything right to say it if you have to ration or not for this particular exercise,

595
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:45,520
a lab we are going to transform no matter what. Okay.

596
01:08:45,530 --> 01:08:49,970
Because that also helps not only with normality, but helps with a constant variance.

597
01:08:49,980 --> 01:08:57,950
Okay. So we're going to confirm that the calories and may not be in this situation.

598
01:08:57,950 --> 01:09:01,940
This is the performance from before, but you will have to do that for the eight times,

599
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:07,760
for the four nutrients and for the ones from the few and the ones from the diet different.

600
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:12,469
Okay. So this is just in the sample that you had to wait for 4 hours and this is the note.

601
01:09:12,470 --> 01:09:20,070
Why I'm telling you to do nutritional measures mostly to improve the normality of their distribution calories is an independent,

602
01:09:20,070 --> 01:09:28,150
very obvious in theory, doesn't need to be transformed because of normality, but for me usually helps with a constant variance assumption, right?

603
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:32,390
So that will work to form impulses. So that's the first thing you have to do.

604
01:09:33,110 --> 01:09:38,569
And now before you start, let me tell you a few things.

605
01:09:38,570 --> 01:09:48,920
So I measured if I told you that at the beginning, I probably should have, because this is a usual error.

606
01:09:48,920 --> 01:10:02,530
When you are working this way as a beginner, when you create a dataset and you work with a permanent deficit and then you create a temporary event,

607
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:07,550
and then you can have I have and create some variables, right?

608
01:10:08,150 --> 01:10:14,240
And then. That's drastic.

609
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:18,450
And then you go and say, Oh, now I want to create the other variables.

610
01:10:18,450 --> 01:10:22,920
And instead of creating them in the same, there I step. You do another step.

611
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:35,340
Be careful about this particular list. Basically what you are doing is that you are creating twice the same dataset from the original one.

612
01:10:35,350 --> 01:10:41,290
So basically you create content creators that I.

613
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:46,140
And when you come here, you basically overwrite completely what you did before.

614
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:51,720
So you're creating new data that doesn't have this and have this.

615
01:10:52,290 --> 01:10:55,830
So then be careful about that because that's a typical kind of like error.

616
01:10:56,580 --> 01:11:01,140
So solutions is that you either do this.

617
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:06,929
So then the third one is from the permanent that I said, but the second one from the temporary that I said.

618
01:11:06,930 --> 01:11:12,360
So then you're just kind of like adding. So that's perfectly fine or even better.

619
01:11:12,670 --> 01:11:17,490
You just put everything in as one dataset so you don't have to worry about that.

620
01:11:17,850 --> 01:11:27,090
Why am I telling you this? Because this you will have this sadly the same situation when you are saving your receivables.

621
01:11:27,780 --> 01:11:34,310
So the linear regression that you have to do to save your receivables is going to be this is your model.

622
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:39,840
So this is a lot of stuff aside from the few and this is the loss of calories from the 50th.

623
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:48,630
Remember to when you get the residual, you have to use the calories from the dietary method that you're using.

624
01:11:48,750 --> 01:11:54,560
Your fat is from before. If you use the calories from the Q, your fat is from the diet records.

625
01:11:54,570 --> 01:12:00,270
You use the calories from the diet. Right. Okay. So and again, you have four nutrients, two dietary methods.

626
01:12:00,270 --> 01:12:13,320
You have two, one eight models like this. Okay. And how do you save them to see those in SAS where you use an alpha where you said kind of like

627
01:12:14,310 --> 01:12:19,470
they're very close to your benefits and then this is going to add the receivers to your dataset.

628
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:24,990
So you're going to just create a copy of the set and then add the new variable within a seamless.

629
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:33,060
And then you are going to call and you'll receive plus whatever you want and usually use the same kind of like name of the value.

630
01:12:33,540 --> 01:12:38,489
Add a yes or not, write something that is easy to identify.

631
01:12:38,490 --> 01:12:42,510
Right? Now this is for one model, but.

632
01:12:48,810 --> 01:12:52,469
You have to keep calling. You're out there.

633
01:12:52,470 --> 01:12:57,990
I said the same because otherwise you change that.

634
01:12:58,530 --> 01:13:03,179
This is not going to be kept. Right. So then you want to have all of your receivers in the center.

635
01:13:03,180 --> 01:13:06,590
I said, keep calling your back. I said the same.

636
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:10,229
So then you get your copy and this is out there.

637
01:13:10,230 --> 01:13:14,310
I said at the beginning, and then you're just adding more and more receivers and you run this.

638
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:20,850
Okay, so be careful with that because this is a neutral thing that you run and then you go back and then you say, What are matrices?

639
01:13:20,850 --> 01:13:25,229
But I just run them well. It's because you are overwriting the data. I said because you were changing the names.

640
01:13:25,230 --> 01:13:30,900
Right? So this is a similar situation to what I told you at the beginning with investors, right?

641
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:34,229
So just keep them, keep the same name.

642
01:13:34,230 --> 01:13:41,559
Don't change and keep this in here and don't use the permanent you use now, the permanent.

643
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:44,940
Then basically you're over right in this step. Okay, so is this thing okay?

644
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:52,049
Okay. So now that you had that was you have your receivers.

645
01:13:52,050 --> 01:14:02,379
Remember, the receivers are like that. And actually I invite you to do up for the names of the received letters,

646
01:14:02,380 --> 01:14:10,720
and you will see that only one or you're not going to be regarded so that you can see that we are going to be unfortunately.

647
01:14:10,730 --> 01:14:15,340
Right. So then now you want to send them in so that they will make sense.

648
01:14:17,830 --> 01:14:22,360
So now to recenter, then follow this goal.

649
01:14:22,450 --> 01:14:27,310
So this call. This is my you received let you know that I'm not putting it on the air.

650
01:14:28,780 --> 01:14:32,979
And what I'm doing is that I'm using the X files.

651
01:14:32,980 --> 01:14:36,760
You're here because I'm thinking that, remember, everything is in the log scale, right?

652
01:14:37,570 --> 01:14:41,260
And this is the receiver as I got from the regression.

653
01:14:42,220 --> 01:14:50,710
And what you have to kind of like plug in here is the intercept and the data from the linear regression where you go to receive less.

654
01:14:50,980 --> 01:14:59,710
Okay. So then when you get that linear regression, I show you now an example that you get well you're interested in the receivers,

655
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:05,049
but also look at the intercept and the data from that linear regression because you need

656
01:15:05,050 --> 01:15:11,950
those two numbers here and then also you need the log of the mean total energy index.

657
01:15:11,950 --> 01:15:15,810
You do have to do a means of back to plugging those numbers.

658
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:20,559
Note that what you are doing with that is just kind of like like adding a constant.

659
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:28,600
I mean, it looks like, wow, like I'm doing something very fancy, but you're this kind of like moving the distribution from the left to the right.

660
01:15:28,780 --> 01:15:33,310
Okay. And I know it looks very weird when you see it this way, but let me show you an example.

661
01:15:33,970 --> 01:15:44,290
So those intercepts and betas are from the regression parameters, from the linear regression model where you got your okay, so let's do together one.

662
01:15:45,850 --> 01:16:22,100
Okay, so let's go set the size. I have no doubt all my thought ever since I have my graduation here.

663
01:16:22,290 --> 01:16:29,210
Okay, so the first thing I'm going to do, remember, we have to do to we have to create the no.

664
01:16:29,870 --> 01:16:37,820
The first thing we have to do is to make this sound like this.

665
01:16:46,260 --> 01:16:51,510
Oh. So, I mean, maybe this week you can see that, right?

666
01:16:51,930 --> 01:16:55,079
So I'm just kind of like I'm doing this for the first one, right?

667
01:16:55,080 --> 01:17:03,600
So I'm going to do the actually the calories from the fuel and the calories from the day of records.

668
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:09,299
And I'm going to do the lotus formation that I find in the lotus from Mexico and the fifth year from there on from the records.

669
01:17:09,300 --> 01:17:14,790
Right. So I run this. I always take that every set.

670
01:17:15,750 --> 01:17:22,520
So I do that. Okay.

671
01:17:22,850 --> 01:17:25,970
No, that really was nothing. The one that.

672
01:17:29,550 --> 01:17:39,260
Okay. So now it's okay. Now.

673
01:17:45,340 --> 01:17:50,360
Actually. I mean, so.

674
01:17:55,780 --> 01:18:04,280
To do this right. Alcohol.

675
01:18:15,350 --> 01:18:32,810
So this kindness and. Huh?

676
01:18:34,130 --> 01:18:38,710
So I guess that's okay.

677
01:18:39,810 --> 01:18:45,760
Okay. So now we run the first rotation.

678
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:47,440
We're going to do it this way. Okay.

679
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:06,399
So you can see that I'm progressing the total effort from the field on the calories, the locales of the from the fifth.

680
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:10,590
Q And then in my same same that I said I'm going to eat them.

681
01:19:10,620 --> 01:19:16,350
I'm getting kind of like I'm getting restless, so I want to run this linear rotation.

682
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:35,820
Everything worked well and then. We have to kind of like keep these numbers in mind.

683
01:19:36,030 --> 01:19:42,210
Okay. This is The Intercept. So let's copy them right here.

684
01:19:45,270 --> 01:19:48,540
And this is the slope. Okay.

685
01:19:52,170 --> 01:19:57,729
And before going into recentering, we are going to do the have to do this and doing this.

686
01:19:57,730 --> 01:20:07,830
So then you see, what is the distribution of the of their procedures?

687
01:20:22,830 --> 01:20:26,760
This should be more normal. Okay.

688
01:20:26,790 --> 01:20:31,920
So there's clearly some violation of the assumptions, but I think it's okay.

689
01:20:32,430 --> 01:20:39,660
But but look at the kind of like the the, the, the distribution instead of like you can see that the mini zero,

690
01:20:39,690 --> 01:20:43,019
I mean, this is what you would expect in and this is the standard deviation.

691
01:20:43,020 --> 01:20:48,150
But clearly, see, I mean, you have positive values and negative values.

692
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:54,450
Right. But this is these are remember, this is representing total fat.

693
01:20:54,870 --> 01:21:00,209
Right. And that is not in their usual kind of like units that you see it way.

694
01:21:00,210 --> 01:21:05,210
I mean, because this is just the amount of total fat that is independent of the calorie intake.

695
01:21:05,220 --> 01:21:10,670
Right. So now you want to take that distribution and move it to the usual kind of labels.

696
01:21:11,190 --> 01:21:16,340
So what you are want to do is to add one constant and that constant is going to be respected.

697
01:21:16,350 --> 01:21:23,910
I mean, you could use all this, but it makes sense to use the respective total fat for an A person with a mean caloric intake.

698
01:21:24,040 --> 01:21:27,750
Okay. So then you move the distribution to something where more or less it should be.

699
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:31,080
Right. So.

700
01:21:32,280 --> 01:21:39,960
So to do that, remember, I have here the two parameters I need and remember ideologue and law.

701
01:21:40,110 --> 01:21:47,010
Right. So then I am going back to to this the rest that.

702
01:21:51,590 --> 01:21:55,590
What's opposed about the transformation.

703
01:21:56,100 --> 01:22:07,880
So I want to use this. So now I'm going to call my New Zealanders.

704
01:22:07,900 --> 01:22:12,420
Going to call this way. I'm taking the old one and then I'm.

705
01:22:12,720 --> 01:22:19,640
What is this intercept? I'm going to put my intercept up, so.

706
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:40,270
And what it says, Lera. I'm going to put my Vera and I'm still missing one more number, which is the love of the mean total energy intake.

707
01:22:42,270 --> 01:22:57,190
That means that the intake of the local ratio. So then I need to also do I'll put up means of that variable, this variable.

708
01:23:09,610 --> 01:23:21,950
So this 7.16, I go here and I substitute that up.

709
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:27,410
So. The.

710
01:23:29,060 --> 01:23:35,990
Good point. Okay.

711
01:23:36,200 --> 01:23:40,640
So now you can see, right? So let me make this bigger.

712
01:23:45,140 --> 01:23:52,850
Okay. So basically, I'm this this this is going to be constant, but I, I'm just going to be replacing members here.

713
01:23:53,130 --> 01:23:58,250
So, so, um, so this, ah, this is an intercept.

714
01:23:58,250 --> 01:24:00,830
This is the data from the linear regression that we just run.

715
01:24:01,220 --> 01:24:10,220
And this is this number you can using all the nutrients for the, for review, for the diet record,

716
01:24:10,230 --> 01:24:14,180
you will have to do a property segment with the log calories from development.

717
01:24:14,540 --> 01:24:19,219
Okay. And then because it's in the log scale, you have to split it.

718
01:24:19,220 --> 01:24:23,330
So you just have to follow this template for all the on them all day notice.

719
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:37,320
Okay. So now if I run that. And I'm going to move this here because in theory, you should get this before then.

720
01:24:37,350 --> 01:24:40,590
You can run this little bit like this.

721
01:24:42,450 --> 01:24:48,750
Now I run this and it's going well, and now I'm going to see what I got.

722
01:24:49,080 --> 01:24:52,370
Okay. With my new. How am I?

723
01:24:54,350 --> 01:24:58,710
So. How my new receivers look.

724
01:25:01,650 --> 01:25:04,920
So these are my new receivers, right? So if I run that.

725
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:11,670
Voila. They look like something more kind of reasonable, right?

726
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:17,819
So they kind of like they mean the meaning.

727
01:25:17,820 --> 01:25:25,560
Tag is 52 and this is the kind of like a standard deviation and they are kind of like positive.

728
01:25:25,650 --> 01:25:33,180
Right. Kind of like I'm I just took that distribution and move it to the proper place like that.

729
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:39,000
I didn't do anything than this kind of analysis because it's just moving the distribution.

730
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:46,130
All the the people are still kind of like signed by their place in the distribution, right?

731
01:25:46,180 --> 01:25:49,260
I'm not changing the place of every person in that distribution.

732
01:25:49,860 --> 01:25:58,470
So. So now but but now if I do approve means I mean, because this is what you will have to do.

733
01:26:06,270 --> 01:26:13,320
Of their original variable with no adjustment and the adjusted variable.

734
01:26:21,140 --> 01:26:24,650
Now. Oops. Can you see? So it's all right.

735
01:26:25,010 --> 01:26:31,190
But now you can. You can compare that kind of light. They are not exactly, exactly the same, but kind of like the.

736
01:26:31,220 --> 01:26:40,160
The means are similar. Right. So the original material is 55 and they the the adjusted is 52 by the skin of a similarly similar place,

737
01:26:40,580 --> 01:26:50,120
but not what happened with the standard deviation in the real variable is 20 and in the residual is 9.9.

738
01:26:50,220 --> 01:27:05,570
Why? Why is lower? Because you're removing that estranged body issue and you do kind of like other things.

739
01:27:06,770 --> 01:27:17,069
I mean, by removing total energy intake, totally intake was kind of like adding extra radiation because of body size, because of age for sex.

740
01:27:17,070 --> 01:27:24,469
So then removing that, you get that kind of like a more kind of like narrower distribution.

741
01:27:24,470 --> 01:27:29,060
So the differences between person differences are lower,

742
01:27:29,090 --> 01:27:34,040
but it makes sense because those are the differences due to the nutrition, not due to other things.

743
01:27:35,240 --> 01:27:41,430
Okay. And this is what you want. So now that you have this new one, now you want to do that?

744
01:27:41,550 --> 01:27:45,080
Yes. Sorry, I need to go back. Yes.

745
01:27:45,320 --> 01:27:48,320
Tell me where you're getting the numbers for the pictures that.

746
01:27:48,650 --> 01:27:52,340
Yes. Yes. So when you run your original your linear elevation.

747
01:27:52,340 --> 01:28:06,020
Right. So this is a linear revision. You run this because you are interested in getting this received was when you run that, you go to your model.

748
01:28:07,010 --> 01:28:14,180
This is the linear regression model. The parameter estimate is can you see the parameter parameter estimate?

749
01:28:14,720 --> 01:28:17,780
So that intercept is -2.7.

750
01:28:17,930 --> 01:28:20,960
And what it says, look out if you that's a slope.

751
01:28:21,290 --> 01:28:25,950
So this is point 92, 742. Yes.

752
01:28:26,340 --> 01:28:33,630
A third member from a firm like the firm and that is coming from the firm number is the mean of the low caloric intake.

753
01:28:34,020 --> 01:28:36,330
So if a number is coming from this part of the goal,

754
01:28:37,650 --> 01:28:44,850
so then I'm just running this is the low calories of a risky I'm doing this Epilog mean, and then you see this is 7.6.

755
01:28:45,690 --> 01:28:49,860
So this one, you can you don't have to run it four banks because I mean,

756
01:28:49,860 --> 01:28:53,910
all this is the same for all the fescue, but you have to run day one for the day.

757
01:28:54,540 --> 01:29:00,430
Okay. Note for note that the barometer tab is going to change for every nutrient.

758
01:29:00,450 --> 01:29:08,430
So what? Going to change? Eight times. The calories only change two times one for the calories there for Q, one for the dietary record.

759
01:29:08,530 --> 01:29:18,270
Okay. So you just kind of like I'm going to leave it like you want me to do save this and send it to you.

760
01:29:19,140 --> 01:29:23,820
Yes. So then you can use this at the end. I mean, if you do have.

761
01:29:23,820 --> 01:29:28,170
They don't I mean, in theory you have. You should have this. You have it.

762
01:29:28,710 --> 01:29:32,580
Well, maybe maybe at the end I have like the watch that I'm going to send you exactly this.

763
01:29:33,090 --> 01:29:40,650
Okay. In this.

764
01:30:04,920 --> 01:30:59,150
Okay. So I'm going to go and want to put it here. Okay. Okay.

765
01:30:59,180 --> 01:31:03,290
Now you have it there. Okay. It's in the. In there. I'm on the files for the lab.

766
01:31:03,620 --> 01:31:08,840
Totally in the lab example. So then you can take that one and then use it as a template for the rest.

767
01:31:09,530 --> 01:31:14,299
Okay. So I did with you the first one and then you have to do the rest.

768
01:31:14,300 --> 01:31:24,530
But let me kind of like let me finish a few things about what you have to do now.

769
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:34,400
Right. Once you have all of them. So once you have all of them, remember, fall under if you fall from the they are records because you have four.

770
01:31:34,970 --> 01:31:38,130
Right. So you have to examine the distributions.

771
01:31:38,170 --> 01:31:41,810
By this I mean these divisions. I mean the take the mean and the standard variation.

772
01:31:41,820 --> 01:31:50,100
Right. The same as I did with the with that one use promise of the calorie adjusted intake and compare them to the absolute value.

773
01:31:50,190 --> 01:32:00,500
Same as I just did. Right. I put abrupt means with the total fat from the 50 original with a total fat adjusted the one that has been sent there.

774
01:32:00,620 --> 01:32:04,879
We send that right because if you hear the ratio, of course, that doesn't make any sense.

775
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:09,370
That why we sent that. And then and then I'm asking you what the your set.

776
01:32:09,380 --> 01:32:13,720
I already told you what you are expecting. The means should be more or less similar in the set.

777
01:32:13,730 --> 01:32:17,630
Losing by the what is really lower is the standard deviation.

778
01:32:17,750 --> 01:32:23,660
Okay, so now that you have all your received last, now you will have to compute.

779
01:32:24,350 --> 01:32:28,740
Remember that the purpose of this exercise was to validate the five.

780
01:32:29,150 --> 01:32:33,740
Right. So we have we have measured total fat cholesterol.

781
01:32:33,830 --> 01:32:37,710
And the other two things I remember protein and carbohydrates, right?

782
01:32:37,730 --> 01:32:41,770
So then we left you and we want to make sure that we are measuring well.

783
01:32:41,780 --> 01:32:49,280
Right. So we are using the total fat, cholesterol, carbohydrates and protein from the diet records as if it was our gold standard.

784
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:54,050
And we are comparing them right, to see how fully correlated they are.

785
01:32:54,180 --> 01:32:59,810
Right. But now we already did that, remember, in the first a lap.

786
01:33:00,080 --> 01:33:05,059
But now we are adjusting for the calorie intake and we know that that's going to help.

787
01:33:05,060 --> 01:33:10,950
Remember, as you, I mean, will happen if you adjust for the calorie intake, this should increase the correlation.

788
01:33:11,010 --> 01:33:17,450
Right. So now you have to compute déclaration coefficients between the calorie adjusted food frequency values

789
01:33:17,450 --> 01:33:24,229
and the greatest the mean of the 25 records for each nutrient and also do the unadjusted notice.

790
01:33:24,230 --> 01:33:28,690
So you'll already read that. So you see the correlation and the digestive one.

791
01:33:29,090 --> 01:33:32,150
So that way you can compare that in theory.

792
01:33:32,180 --> 01:33:36,980
I mean, sometimes things are not perfect, so it's possible that one doesn't improve,

793
01:33:37,430 --> 01:33:43,790
but in theory, most correlation coefficient should improve once you adjust for totality intake.

794
01:33:44,570 --> 01:33:52,010
Okay. And then you have to interpret and discuss in two sentences the differences between the group and the calorie adjusted correlation.

795
01:33:52,310 --> 01:33:55,910
Okay. So this is what you have to do once you have all of them.

796
01:33:57,410 --> 01:34:03,500
Now, in all this, because I am asking you to do special measures for everything.

797
01:34:03,500 --> 01:34:08,719
Right? So if we parametric this but the if you do this so you could do experiment,

798
01:34:08,720 --> 01:34:15,020
but I would prefer you do so we all do the same, do lots of measures and do some correlation.

799
01:34:15,080 --> 01:34:22,860
Okay. And then I'm asking you a couple of scenes where we're using a lot of information.

800
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:31,000
So this is your very dojo. And then summarize briefly the advantages of correcting for caloric intake when evaluating questions.

801
01:34:31,590 --> 01:34:34,370
Remember that not this, like I told you,

802
01:34:34,380 --> 01:34:41,330
you have to remember today because that's when looking at this is not doing this this association that the other one the one that we are really so.

803
01:34:41,730 --> 01:34:46,440
So you have to do because you have the same question later in part two.

804
01:34:46,740 --> 01:34:54,510
But for the other part. Okay. So this is one validating question is remember, strength is variation and that's allowed.

805
01:34:55,050 --> 01:34:58,320
I'm already giving you the answer. So please, I said that's okay.

806
01:34:58,680 --> 01:35:02,730
And this is to be done on your own. Okay. So that's information for today.

807
01:35:03,240 --> 01:35:06,360
So work in part for part one.

808
01:35:06,750 --> 01:35:11,970
We still have like a few minutes. So then go over here to to answer questions.

809
01:35:27,320 --> 01:35:39,780
Yes. You.

810
01:35:42,950 --> 01:35:51,350
Look at all. Yeah.

811
01:35:51,370 --> 01:35:54,490
Yeah. You have to have a better way to play that.

812
01:35:54,500 --> 01:36:01,620
But for this particular situation, I think I think you set the goal that you need to do that.

813
01:36:02,130 --> 01:36:09,660
I think you make more time that you just got your place. I mean, you had to do that over and over and over and over.

814
01:36:10,270 --> 01:36:14,790
I do have a map of where you would receive that would do that.

815
01:36:14,980 --> 01:36:16,830
Right. So that's until you deep.

816
01:36:16,920 --> 01:36:25,590
And I don't think I would expect people to say and do they ever think a lot of things that they can share and that one thing you can send me an.

817
01:36:27,720 --> 01:36:33,870
Okay. So here am.

818
01:36:33,900 --> 01:36:37,340
So this is how this is allowed?

819
01:36:37,640 --> 01:36:42,050
Yeah, well, I mean, I think it's the other way around because they may have a lot of other, you know, this.

820
01:36:42,290 --> 01:36:50,630
No, no, no. This is the way. That is this way. You have to do that once you've done it.

821
01:36:52,820 --> 01:36:56,210
Oh, I see. Yeah. You movie.

822
01:36:58,070 --> 01:37:03,950
Yeah, I know. Except I just love the first.

823
01:37:16,840 --> 01:37:24,540
Did I hear? No, it was.

824
01:37:35,070 --> 01:37:42,510
They'll find you. Whatever you call. Yes, you.

825
01:37:45,160 --> 01:37:49,130
I'm running. Okay.

826
01:37:50,610 --> 01:37:55,560
So you do that. Can I do that? Yeah, it is two one.

827
01:37:56,730 --> 01:37:59,840
I mean, not that one. You only have to do it twice.

828
01:38:00,150 --> 01:38:05,750
One for. You know what I'm saying?

829
01:38:05,750 --> 01:38:09,220
For. So from that.

830
01:38:14,200 --> 01:38:20,720
This is the limit in that. You can still be in, basically.

831
01:38:21,880 --> 01:38:33,460
Yeah. Okay. Well.

832
01:38:39,830 --> 01:39:09,590
Sure. Well, you had to change it and change because you are changing these days and you're going to get new devices every year to.

833
01:39:11,970 --> 01:39:17,480
Oh, yes.

834
01:39:17,530 --> 01:39:21,630
Use the word translation. Okay.

835
01:39:22,590 --> 01:39:28,740
So instead of a nation of one voting population who lives in the US, it was lovely.

836
01:39:29,270 --> 01:39:33,860
Then I said, You're just right. It's just that.

837
01:39:36,520 --> 01:39:52,840
There. Feedback and apologies.

838
01:39:59,240 --> 01:40:04,710
No. This is one of the great investigations, this murder investigation.

839
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:12,700
You already. Oh, no, no, no, no.

840
01:40:12,710 --> 01:40:19,810
Not only that. No. And.

841
01:40:23,310 --> 01:40:27,320
Meaning the. So.

842
01:40:28,010 --> 01:40:36,660
Yeah, I'm just. We are constantly operating different outlets.

843
01:40:38,580 --> 01:40:45,440
I mean, what went through your mind right now, what you did yesterday?

844
01:40:45,450 --> 01:40:50,500
And do I feel bad for each you but own.

845
01:40:52,470 --> 01:40:56,630
Oh. So.

846
01:40:58,200 --> 01:41:04,480
You know it. People take a look at a loser.

847
01:41:10,110 --> 01:41:16,880
What I want you to do is to do what I want to do.

848
01:41:19,700 --> 01:41:35,090
So it's very important that people know that you.

849
01:41:54,600 --> 01:42:03,770
We? It sounds.

850
01:42:09,100 --> 01:42:13,170
I. That.

851
01:42:15,160 --> 01:42:19,020
Yeah. I don't know what.

852
01:42:21,710 --> 01:42:38,310
So I'm sure that they. And that's what the.

853
01:42:40,710 --> 01:42:46,660
Do you have a. Yes.

854
01:42:48,220 --> 01:42:56,520
They. Every newspaper and every day.

855
01:42:56,620 --> 01:42:59,709
Because you have to comply with every sentence.

856
01:42:59,710 --> 01:43:08,940
Plead guilty, every book. So it's.

857
01:43:14,760 --> 01:43:24,049
So any time. I know that I told you that.

858
01:43:24,050 --> 01:43:27,130
Sometimes you don't want to know the.

859
01:43:29,260 --> 01:43:33,239
But then I was like, Wow. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

860
01:43:33,240 --> 01:43:37,149
I got it. It was more or less usually looks well.

861
01:43:37,150 --> 01:43:37,809
Yeah, yeah.

862
01:43:37,810 --> 01:43:53,250
When you still put on the even though I'm giving you some homework, maybe you think that they are letting someone try to make their complacency here.

863
01:43:53,260 --> 01:43:56,290
There's a reason for that.

864
01:43:56,380 --> 01:44:00,520
I hear a lot of that is long gone.

865
01:44:00,930 --> 01:45:35,680
Yes. Yeah. No.

866
01:47:12,900 --> 01:47:16,800
Well, because you were so. I mean, you listen to.

867
01:47:17,370 --> 01:47:29,490
I mean. I mean, come on.

868
01:47:29,520 --> 01:47:33,570
Tell me. And so there you.

869
01:47:42,550 --> 01:47:50,100
Yes. When does the bigger issue?

870
01:47:57,450 --> 01:48:06,430
So we have to. So this is a. This is for neutering and persuasion.

871
01:48:06,600 --> 01:48:09,950
If you want to see how our neutering changes at home.

872
01:48:11,530 --> 01:48:19,100
This doesn't look like it's like aggression.

873
01:48:19,140 --> 01:48:26,780
But this could be a really good way to.

874
01:48:34,570 --> 01:48:38,280
Yeah. That is what to see here at the moment.

875
01:48:39,120 --> 01:48:46,090
This is a television. That's an investment. That's what each different sectors and we have.

876
01:48:51,580 --> 01:48:56,730
Now all of these are. Families need to have a business.

877
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:07,450
And so this makes it easier for me to put in the motivation.

878
01:49:18,170 --> 01:49:25,520
I'm very serious. And this is more than leading to the interpretation of everything.

879
01:49:25,770 --> 01:49:33,680
It's like what happened to the police. So the recording has more important things for you to.

880
01:49:38,990 --> 01:49:53,030
The best part is that I still by doing that, you make changes that you want to make about how to be able to please 32 degrees but.

881
01:49:57,990 --> 01:50:01,250
And then when you kill people, you have to do anything.

882
01:50:02,220 --> 01:50:08,120
You are not going to be more responsible when they change.

883
01:50:08,760 --> 01:50:21,610
I'm going to let me. Okay.
