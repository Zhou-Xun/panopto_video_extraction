1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:08,190
So it does look like it's such a small country is right in the middle of the like, especially for like the educated class.

2
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:11,240
Almost everybody speaks English. At least one other language.

3
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:17,910
They're kind of almost in order to take pride themselves on how well they speak English.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:26,250
But it's very hard to go and try to practice your Dutch there because the is that they hear some sort of little hint of different accents.

5
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:31,060
They'll switch to whatever language, you know, I want to keep trying to that like.

6
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:36,020
No, no, it's no trouble, I'm sure. Not really. Yeah.

7
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:39,780
And a lot of you to show off my. Yeah, exactly. My husband's like that.

8
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:54,250
Continue reading from what I wrote during the conference here.

9
00:00:54,860 --> 00:01:02,770
No, but that's what I did, was I go off back home and I'm all sweaty and I'm like, no, I've forgotten that.

10
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:09,320
So I don't know how to compare this to a secretary, but in fact, that's.

11
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:20,290
But in a slowdown, I think the pattern is. Any other tricks, though?

12
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:29,150
All right. It's like Morehouse and, like, turn it around.

13
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:36,650
Go backwards a little bit. Turn back around. I mean, my cross over, you know, all of that.

14
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:45,870
And then from the other side, you're going to have to have either I don't have the confidence to do that and yeah I it's

15
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:51,600
easier downhill more after you just like I think explain those three you had to push off.

16
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,120
How are you able to tell like scarring due to age of the dosing?

17
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,000
Because I know like with dosing and like during glide this long scarring that

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,980
happens versus one due to like a like scarring and tissue like if you're injecting.

19
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:08,470
Yeah. So it can be hard. Okay.

20
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:16,500
Obviously there's like a location thing. So if you're providing the area where you expect that to occur.

21
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:22,470
Right. So like given all the animals, the bars, if you're injecting, you're going to expect a certain amount of injection reaction.

22
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,650
Usually you'll have a control group. So they're just going to daily.

23
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:29,240
Yeah. It's kind of like your baseline of how much is there comparing between.

24
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:39,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. And how did that question about you probably explained this in class, but now I look at and I'm confused like the p450.

25
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:45,809
Then it's like p450 provides oxygen to for these reactions, but from 0 to 3,

26
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:52,770
it's like it's the opposite notion of like oxygen concentration decreases on this way and p450 comes this way after base.

27
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:58,140
Oxygen wise, they're on the opposite side as a kid, let me be clear about this, I think.

28
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:02,280
And so it's not like there's no oxygen.

29
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,300
Okay, this is a yes or a gradient or we are.

30
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:13,080
Then you're giving up oxygen to the hepatocytes as you go down towards the central bank.

31
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:18,360
Yeah. And it doesn't like that she's strong.

32
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:23,309
I mean, in the U.S., I'm trying to think like there's an evolutionary explanation for that, but I mean, that's all theoretical.

33
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:28,560
Yeah. Yeah. So it's not like there's no oxygen because if there was, you could actually have necrosis of hepatic.

34
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:32,200
So there is oxygen just a smaller amount. Yeah. Okay.

35
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:41,280
Yeah, that makes sense, I think. And like if you have injury in that zone three for the liver.

36
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:51,450
Yeah. So that can happen either due to like if you have a chemical that's metabolized through a toxic intermediate through P 450.

37
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:54,900
So now I have, you know, everything's cool, everything's fine.

38
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:59,100
And then it gets there's a higher concentration of a toxic metabolite in zone three.

39
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:05,130
So now I have necrosis because of cytotoxicity from that toxic intermediate like acetaminophen.

40
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:10,080
Or you could have necrosis in that area because of hypoxia.

41
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:19,490
Like maybe I have a clot in my heart or in the lung or something, and my oxygen supply to the liver as a whole is already decreased.

42
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:26,180
So now the third zone, you are kind of okay before they're below the level of the top of that.

43
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:30,570
Yeah. So then my challenge. What I'll see visually.

44
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,980
Okay, I have zone three necrosis. Yeah.

45
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:41,819
So now I have to figure out, okay, is this due to a toxicant mechanism or you know, might have nothing to do with that.

46
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:45,629
It might be hypoxia. Okay. So then I have to look like in the heart look elsewhere.

47
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:49,680
Is there evidence for some is there some reason for hypoxia or do I know?

48
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,000
Okay. Well, this is a drug metabolizing p450. Everything else looks okay.

49
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:58,170
Maybe this is p450 metabolism. So a lot of comparisons between.

50
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,190
Yeah, yeah. And like pathology. There only so many things the body can do.

51
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:09,660
So the pathology narrows it down to the process. And then you usually have more than one cause for that process.

52
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:13,020
So that's you don't have a specific I know it's not usually.

53
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:18,450
So like the thing we looked at this morning with acetaminophen, with a giant fiber sticking in the middle of the lesion,

54
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:22,860
like that would be kind of the more rare example of like you have pathology and

55
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:27,090
there is the thing that caused it or like if you have a big parasite in the middle,

56
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:31,530
but more often it's a body change, like the process, inflammation, whatever.

57
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:35,220
And you have to think based on where it is on the organ.

58
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:40,410
Okay. Well, there's a short list of things that could cause this. Now, let me look at all my information.

59
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:45,299
Like, if you want to look at cause or find cause, it's like diagnostic pathology is like that.

60
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:50,130
In times past, you usually no, you gave the animal and then you just go think mechanism.

61
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,329
All right, guys, I'm going to start. I have a constraint today.

62
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:04,350
I had a hard start, probably around three or 350 in the American College of Veterinary Pathologists meeting.

63
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:11,909
I have to leave and catch a plane right after this. So I've a hard stop as a one healthy, excited.

64
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:16,500
Whereas if it's in Boston. Oh, my hometown. So home state anyway.

65
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:19,180
I'm really sad about that. But I think we can finish it.

66
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:25,330
But we're going to do is finish up the stats part for an episode that we didn't get to do before us.

67
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:28,330
It's kind of like a little part in the center of that module six.

68
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:37,150
And then I'm going to do just kind of a wrap up. We touched upon it when we talked about RSV and some of the mechanisms, but we'll wrap that up today.

69
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:45,490
So after today, you should have everything you need to complete your papers in the imminent wrap up lecture today.

70
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:50,079
When I talk about immune mechanisms, I actually also even have a little references on the bottom.

71
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:57,820
So like when you're writing your discussion, if you need starting places to look for references there, you can use the ones in the lecture.

72
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:02,590
Obviously, you have to look, look up the full citation and cite them in the correct format.

73
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:06,520
But you should have everything that you need for your papers.

74
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:15,519
Today was do the results everything but the histology next week I think we have it is that you're just adding on the microscopy.

75
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:22,360
If you look in canvas, you should have all the figures and diagrams everything you need and then you'll have the 18 through the well,

76
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:26,530
the 18th through the second, December 2nd, the final papers do.

77
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:32,860
And as I think I wrote on the thing, November 28th, if you want me to look at your internal discussion,

78
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:37,950
try to get it to me by November 28th, which is a monday. I think that I have time to get it back to you for to change stuff.

79
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:40,690
But that last part, you don't have to do that if you're like,

80
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:47,170
I got this or in school and or if you run out of time or something, that's not all right.

81
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,680
So that's the big picture. Let's look at some.

82
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:56,010
Oh, so I just thought you had this hard stop and like, the first thing I do is throw in an extra slide.

83
00:07:56,390 --> 00:08:03,070
It's like my M.O. But I was thinking about I think it was Jennifer asked this really great question last time when we

84
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:08,560
were talking about the adjuvant and we saw that amorphous stuff in the injection reaction site.

85
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:13,899
We talked about how the aluminum leaves and I said something like, well,

86
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:18,100
the adjuvant and all the stuff gets phagocytosis by macrophages and things get broken down.

87
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,100
But I was like, you know, I really want to look into that a little bit more.

88
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:29,380
So as far as aluminum there, there are things known about the body burden of aluminum from foods and from vaccines.

89
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:33,460
So as you probably know, it's a pretty prevalent natural element.

90
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:40,030
But human intake or human exposure, we actually do take in a fair amount of aluminum from foods.

91
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:45,939
There are small examples there from foods that contain various amounts of aluminum.

92
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:49,480
So for comparison, like if you take an antacid tablet, depending on the type,

93
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:54,010
there's like a couple of hundred milligrams of aluminum in that antacid tablet.

94
00:08:54,430 --> 00:09:01,880
We drink a cup of tea, a little less than a milligram in a cup of tea and in a vaccine and an aluminum adjuvanted vaccine.

95
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:09,459
So with aluminum hydroxide or aluminum phosphate a little bit less amount of aluminum than or a little bit more than around the same as a cup of tea,

96
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,380
2.5 milligrams per dose.

97
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:22,090
So that's in terms of burden from the lumen by ingestion, like from foods, a very small amount of the ingested aluminum is absorbed from the GI tract.

98
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:27,490
So even though we're taking in all this amount from food, little of that makes it to the bloodstream.

99
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:35,770
But the amount of aluminum that does make it to the bloodstream from the GI tract or from a vaccine depot site.

100
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:44,440
Remember when we talked about you get phagocytosis, you get absorption at the vaccine depot site, it doesn't float in the body as aluminum ion.

101
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,950
It's bound to transferrin, which is one of the transport proteins.

102
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:52,629
When we talked about liver, it's one of the proteins made by the liver usually used to transport iron,

103
00:09:52,630 --> 00:10:00,960
but it also can bind aluminum so it's bound to transparent and plasma and it can be actually transported through the kidneys.

104
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:07,630
The majority of absorbed aluminum is excreted through the kidney a little bit through bile, but mostly through the kidney.

105
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:16,030
So very, very little of an ingested amount of aluminum or the amount absorbed from a vaccine site actually remains in the body.

106
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:19,630
The stuff that does remain in the body is mostly in bone.

107
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:27,370
And the average adult body burden, like on average from sort of a lifetime accumulation, is only about 50 to 70 milligrams.

108
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:33,250
So there is some retention of aluminum, as there is for many minerals essentially in tissue.

109
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:39,700
But the amount that you take in from the environment through food and through vaccine is relatively small.

110
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:46,540
And then this is just to better describe this was the part that I wanted to understand better from our discussion last week.

111
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:54,220
This was hard to find, but this is not for your paper or anything. But just so we know in a macrophage that you're at that site of vaccine injection,

112
00:10:55,300 --> 00:11:03,310
the aluminum in the adjuvant is bound or bound to the antigen, and it's also in the form of aluminum particles.

113
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:13,090
So there's free this is like really small, there's free aluminum iron, but there's also particulate like kind of aggregated aluminum present.

114
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:16,420
So that's a particle like any other. So that can get phagocytes.

115
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:22,530
Toast by the macrophage and then in the phagosome so it can end up obvious and so on.

116
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:31,829
Fuzed with the Lysosomes. So in that abysmal compartment you could have breakup of that part, like the agglomerate, the particular aluminum.

117
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:36,390
So you're going to generate free aluminum ions. So essentially you're getting dissolution.

118
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:50,790
So getting soluble, dissolved aluminum ion, that itself can change membrane polarity and affect the phagocytic active enzymes and itself.

119
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:55,530
It's a bit of a dangerous signal. So this part in this paper to me seemed a little hand wavy.

120
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:03,389
But there's some thought that one of the mechanisms for aluminum or for adjuvants kind of activating that

121
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:10,950
inflammatory response is a change in or the essentially ionic effects of this increase in cellular aluminum.

122
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:17,400
So it appears in vitro to be pushing the macrophages towards an M1 or a pro-inflammatory

123
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:22,800
phenotype and that may actually enhance the production of t of M1 cytokines.

124
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:26,190
Pull more macrophages in and remember the net effect.

125
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:32,010
You want a little bit of an inflammatory response so that you can get antigen presenting cells into the area.

126
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:36,780
So if you have no adjuvant and you have very few, like just the resident macrophages,

127
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:43,290
you actually tend to not have an effective immune response because you just don't get enough antigen to the draining lymph nodes.

128
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:48,359
So that's a little bit more about what happens to that aluminum. And then this was kind of interesting.

129
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:54,390
This is looking at, you know, with vaccines, there's been concern about aluminum as an adjuvant in vaccines for children.

130
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:58,919
There's been some some dubious scientific literature about effects of it.

131
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:07,890
And then there's other information that's more reliable. But the net effect, there are minimum risk levels established for aluminum.

132
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:17,760
So ATSDR has levels that are considered or there's no appreciable evidence that there is adverse effect in the body below those levels.

133
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,449
And so this is for infants. So this is days of age for infants.

134
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:26,549
And these are the ATSDR established minimum risk levels in the body.

135
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:31,709
For aluminum, it's by weight. So like the 50th percentile where the fifth percentile overweight weight.

136
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:38,640
But this is kind of the risk level aluminum that you take in from food as a baby, like from breast milk and from formula.

137
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:45,150
That's the bottom two lines. And then the aluminum burden from vaccines in the first year of life.

138
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:51,210
So you get a lot of vaccines from adjuvant. That's not like the way they did this diagram, but that's this black line.

139
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:57,810
I don't know why they put this line here, but it's just this black line. And then this pink thing is that margin of exposure.

140
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:05,730
So there is body garner of aluminum, mostly from food that we're taking in, in the environment.

141
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:16,560
And then the overall average aluminum burden in an average adult is in the range of 50 to 70 milligrams.

142
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:21,300
And remember, the vaccine amount in a single dose is about 0.85 milligrams.

143
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:27,570
So just a little more info on where that aluminum goes. That was a something I hadn't really thought about before.

144
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:32,070
But you don't need to say this in your paper. It's just just, you know.

145
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:40,470
All right. That was just follow up from last week. So but what I did want to talk about, how do we compare histology data between groups?

146
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:48,960
So this is the part we kind of omitted. So we spent a separate lecture on talking about continuous data.

147
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:56,490
So things like the body weights, the cell counts, which is much more straightforward to deal with from a statistical standpoint.

148
00:14:57,150 --> 00:15:01,440
But now we're thinking about categorical data where we're just slotting things, calling lesions,

149
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:07,590
identifying things, and that can either be things that have no intrinsic order.

150
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,229
So this is a certain type of tumor or certain type of lesion.

151
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:16,379
It's just a named nominal category or can be dichotomous.

152
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:22,080
Is there a tumor or not? So essentially a yes or no answer for a particular category of lesion.

153
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:27,750
So both of those types of pathology data are analyzed as incidence data.

154
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:34,320
So yes or no, are they present or not? And so here's your bare essentials histology slide four Incidence Data.

155
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:42,389
So the most common statistical tests applied in vivo toxicology for incidence data are the Fisher's

156
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:54,590
exact or a Chi square test looking just at differences between groups that first do that later.

157
00:15:54,930 --> 00:16:02,700
So incidence, data and histology, essentially what you're looking to do is to calculate the rate of whatever the lesion is,

158
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:12,450
the rate of incidents in each group, and then compare the expected rate of incidence in each group like in comparison to the control group.

159
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:16,380
So you're answering the question, is the likelihood of tumor different from.

160
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:22,580
Control in one or more of the groups. So is there one group that's greater than the control?

161
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:29,420
The Fishers? Exact. I don't have a formula or anything for you here because I just want you to understand the conceptual basis.

162
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:35,899
You're calculating the rate of tumor in each group and it computes an exact p value for the likelihood that

163
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:41,030
the incidence in your dose groups at any one of these dose groups is different than that of the control.

164
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:49,820
So it's just a likelihood comparison of incidence. These from a conceptual aspect, these tests are very similar.

165
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,130
The fishers exact tends to be used for smaller numerical values, the chi square for larger ones.

166
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:58,970
And there's a difference in how the p value is calculated.

167
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:06,770
The Fisher's exact name comes from the fact that it computes an exact p value and Chi square does an approximation of the p value.

168
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:12,980
Probably. Fishers is more commonly used in in-vivo talks because we're usually dealing with much smaller numbers.

169
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:18,830
So this tells you if the likelihood of a lesion incident is different in your control groups,

170
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:24,230
it does not answer, at least in the statistical test, the question of whether that's dose dependent.

171
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:32,570
Okay, so I could have a result that says yes, the low dose group had a statistically higher incidence of tumor than the control.

172
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:38,180
I have to externally look at this and say, do I think this is combat related?

173
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:43,250
Well, if it were, I would kind of expect that my medium and high dose groups would be significant as well.

174
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:47,870
So you're applying that assessment of dose dependance external to the statistical test.

175
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:52,549
I mean, that's easy enough to do. Usually for the small numbers that we have, we will talk.

176
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:56,710
So this is probably the most common test for incidence data, right?

177
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:04,610
If you want to apply a dose dependent sort of aspect to it, there is sort of another test that you can apply.

178
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:09,080
There's the Armitage trend test, which has some similarities.

179
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:18,920
It's still asking about the incidence of tumor in the different dose groups, but it's recognizing that the independent variable.

180
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:25,310
So your assignment of the group categories is ordinal. So it's really more of a correlation.

181
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:31,820
You're asking whether the incidence of the lesion increases with these ordinarily ranked dose groups.

182
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:37,220
It's kind of like a correlation of incidence with the ordinal dose groups.

183
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:48,680
Okay. So the downside to this is that it usually only is applicable in toxicology to two dependent variables.

184
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:55,580
You can apply it to tumor or no tumor. So you would have to do this individually for every lesion you come up with.

185
00:18:55,820 --> 00:19:02,360
And if I were doing this for a non neoplastic lesion, like, let's say inflammation in the lung,

186
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:12,290
I have no measure of severity, so it cannot accommodate ordinal aspects to the dependent variable.

187
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:22,760
So I can't say is there a dose dependent increase in the incidence of inflammation and is the inflammation worse in the higher dose groups,

188
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:29,720
do you not? I'm saying so like the dose groups that can do the independent variable, you can accommodate or naledi.

189
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:37,730
But again, you would have to externally apply an assessment of whether the severity is getting worse in your dose groups so it's less commonly used.

190
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:41,899
So you lose a lot of information, information that way.

191
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:47,990
So what if you wanted to incorporate severity, you're going to make your life a lot more complicated.

192
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:56,510
So that has to do with the variable, the dependent variable being ordinal.

193
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:01,310
So it's still a name? Yeah. Nobody's injured.

194
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:06,590
It's still a name, you know, mild, moderate, severe. Or if you want to assign that a number, that's fine, too.

195
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:11,410
But it's still it's you're not counting or measure anything.

196
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:19,609
You're just assessing it in some way that you've created. So even though there are nominal categories, they are ranked.

197
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:24,800
So there is some relationship between these. And then we talked earlier about how you can kind of make scoring systems.

198
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:31,879
One thing about these that especially is easy to forget if you make these define scoring systems like, oh,

199
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:37,490
look, there's percentages here, there's like some assessment to it, but you're estimating those by EI,

200
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:46,009
so they're not really measure counted and they're non parametric by nature because of that lack of measuring or counting,

201
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:49,520
but also because the spaces between categories are not even.

202
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:56,690
So if I call something up too and say that it's mild severity of inflammation and then I've call another slide of four,

203
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:01,040
doesn't really mean that this side is twice as bad as this one.

204
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:05,600
It's not really mathematically related, and that's surprisingly easy to forget when you're looking at data.

205
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:12,770
But like because of that, you can't even really apply standard non parametric statistics.

206
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:16,340
So this is probably the most common.

207
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:22,900
I mean, statistical error that you see in pathology and this is super, super common.

208
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:28,700
In fact, I am sure that I papers with my name on it with non parametric testing.

209
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:36,070
This is actually what I was taught in pathology school as to how to evaluate severity data and it's wrong.

210
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,990
So when we did, you know, blood counts and things, we talked about it.

211
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,820
You know, the if your data meets the criteria for normal distribution variance.

212
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:52,479
So if you have parametric data, you can apply an ordinary ANOVA abs that is very incorrect.

213
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,540
You absolutely cannot utilize that for histology data.

214
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:57,970
There's no way you can really spin that and make that correct.

215
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:05,559
So then you might think, okay, not knowing, going to distribute it, I'm going to try the non non parametric equivalent,

216
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:12,879
the crystal balls, you know, but that assume one of the assumptions is that the ordinal variables are evenly distributed.

217
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:18,420
So there's an even distance between those categories. And really that's not the case.

218
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:27,520
So technically, you're kind of not applying an accurate assessment when you utilize this means of assessing histology data.

219
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:35,229
What usually happens is also because this is less sensitive, usually end up not getting significance and then people, right?

220
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:41,139
Well, those are trends or significance, but the statistical test is not really appropriate to apply.

221
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:44,709
It's just not. But it's very, very hard to deal with this data.

222
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:50,590
So you will see that like all the ways out. Correct. So there's a couple of strategies that you could do.

223
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:56,080
And one of the most common ones, this is the national toxicology program strategy is sidestep the question.

224
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:04,570
So strategy one, if you can convert your measure to incidence data and forget the the severity question out of it.

225
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:09,510
So here we have one scores for inflammation, you know, mild, moderate, severe.

226
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:17,020
The key is up in the upper right here is our control group. We have our different severity scores here, but this is incidence data.

227
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:23,530
So two out of our four controls showed inflammation, four out of our four treated animals did.

228
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:32,530
So that's great. So now we feel like we can use our fisher tests, we can apply our incidence data, but we've lost a lot of information here.

229
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:37,209
Right? So if you just look at these numbers, it seems this very small,

230
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:44,560
but it seems like things are a little more severe in this group and we're completely ignoring the severity scores by doing it this way.

231
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:52,150
So a couple of ways of doing it that if you're committed to your sidestepping strategy, you can decide on a threshold.

232
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:55,570
So you're like, okay, well, there's a certain amount of background in my control,

233
00:23:55,570 --> 00:24:01,030
so I'm going to say I'm only going to count as incidence anything above a two, right?

234
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:04,030
So there must be zero out of four. This would be two out of four.

235
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:10,540
That's a little better. But it's still there might be some nuances in here because remember, if you're a system,

236
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:19,450
these by these are 100% objective measures either so you still get some hand-waving is here, but that's one way of doing it.

237
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:24,400
So one strategy is to convert things to incidence data.

238
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:30,639
Another is to convert it to something that you can count or measure directly.

239
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,240
So try to make it more like our bloodwork or our body weight data.

240
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:41,229
And if you can do that, then depending on whether you meet the criteria for a parametric test or non parametric,

241
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:47,290
you can use all the same tests that we talked about before. So maybe there's something you can count or measure.

242
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:55,449
So this is the same example I gave with inflammation and now some poor person was stuck

243
00:24:55,450 --> 00:25:00,490
counting immunohistochemical labeled macrophages per millimeter squared of tissue.

244
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:05,349
So you're counting something and that gives you a little bit more nuance.

245
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:10,360
And now these are just numbers, a rash, accounting, something so I can analyze them like I would white blood cell data.

246
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:17,290
Cons It's not always possible to do this if I have a lesion that doesn't have a good cellular

247
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:20,890
marker and I don't have a good antibody and I don't have something that I can count,

248
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:29,710
you know, there's nothing I can really generate or if it's hard to measure area and if you have to do this manually, this is extremely tedious.

249
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:34,210
So this is a huge bottleneck. And mostly you want to try to avoid doing this if you can.

250
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:40,089
We're a little bit fortunate now because there's better and better means of automating some of this,

251
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:43,480
particularly if you have a good immunohistochemistry marker.

252
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:49,389
So this is a study of LPs that's a component of gram negative cell walls.

253
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:56,500
So this is an LP study that I had to measure degree of neutrophil influx in the lung as a marker of inflammation.

254
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:01,090
So I used there was an image analysis program called Queue Path.

255
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:07,420
It's open source. I highly recommend it if you have to cap any sort of image and it allows you there's actually

256
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:12,040
kind of quick ways you can teach it to do tissue recognition so you can get an area measurement.

257
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,180
This was like for lung parenchyma, but I didn't want to count the main airway and.

258
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,540
So I got it to generate an area measurement.

259
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:27,270
And then within the area that I had selected, I put in the parameters that tell me which which things of this size are brown.

260
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:32,250
And you can kind of train it to like the optical qualities of brown or the red things or the positive cells.

261
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:36,990
And all the blue things are the negative cells. And that I can get a number of cells per tissue area.

262
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:41,460
So that's one really good way of doing it if you have a good immunohistochemical marker.

263
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:44,040
If you ever have to do anything like that,

264
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:51,629
I highly recommend keep out this great little tutorial video videos and it's really downloadable and I have some nice cheat sheet,

265
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:52,800
so contact me for me.

266
00:26:53,910 --> 00:27:04,110
But that makes it a lot more manageable if you don't have a cell mark or if you're trying to recognize a structure in the tissue,

267
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:12,270
it gets a little harder. Either you can laboriously outline that structure or you can train a more sophisticated

268
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:16,950
machine learning strategy to kind of be your eyes and recognize that structure for you.

269
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:24,900
So with neural networks now, we can actually train based on the quality of pixels.

270
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:34,170
Mean you can train a mathematical model to detect what is a particular, particular morphologic feature.

271
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:42,980
So I can take a test slide. This is spleen and I was trying to train a model to recognize white pulp versus red pulp and this was immuno,

272
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:50,669
um, immune deficient or I think it was a phenotypic study that basically they were immune suppressed.

273
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:58,050
And I wanted to measure the shrinking size of the white matter in the spleen compared to the overall size of the spleen.

274
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:05,729
So you basically make a bunch of circles and train a program to recognize what pixels in the white matter look like versus the red matter.

275
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:10,110
And then you can run that over a large number of slides and get these cool little color overlays.

276
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,410
This is kind of the same thing with cortex and medulla of the famous.

277
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:20,250
And here we were actually able to apply a numerical value to the shrinking of the various areas of interest.

278
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:25,590
So if there's something visual that you can see, like if I can teach a person how to recognize it,

279
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:28,650
this is usually possible to do in a neural network based model,

280
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:34,820
takes a lot of computing power and you have to have enough training slides or enough training area.

281
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:39,600
Because the thing that is difficult is teaching in the wide variety of normal.

282
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,720
So there's artifacts and things that can really screw things up.

283
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:52,050
So it takes more time than you would think, but it is actually a really nice strategy to getting some more quantitative data out of histology.

284
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:57,090
So a lot of pathology is moving that way. That is a commercial product.

285
00:28:57,110 --> 00:29:00,099
Since a number of commercial products available for this, it's very expensive.

286
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:05,790
But fortunately, this is one that's also a commercial product by Foria, but it's by subscription.

287
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:09,990
And this is one that this is not my project, but this is one that I'm working on now.

288
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:14,130
We got a lot of colitis models and here they've trained.

289
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:15,450
This is a small intestine.

290
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:24,660
They've trained to recognize the abnormal area in red of the small intestine versus the normal common or small intestine versus the normal area.

291
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:34,469
And then you can get a percent area affected. So a lot of severity data is going this way in talks that works best for experimental

292
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:38,820
models because it takes a fair amount of time and computing power to make these models.

293
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:45,600
And if you are applying that to like a whole mouse, you'd have to have some sort of crazy, huge library of normal.

294
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:50,130
So it's not like Star Trek where you can just like feed all the slides in and say, Show me the abnormal.

295
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:54,149
But there's a lot of interest in the pharmaceutical industry, too,

296
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:59,490
and at least getting some screening basis to pull two sides that are different from what you would typically expect.

297
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:04,590
But in experimental biology, this is kind of really a huge area of interest in pathology.

298
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:09,390
Eventually, this class will have some of this in it. But I need a good dataset.

299
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:22,110
You need a better dataset. Okay. So you can convert things to a ratio so that hopefully you can apply some more easily applicable statistical tests,

300
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:23,890
either parametric or non parametric.

301
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:31,319
But if that fails, if you can't automated or there's nothing you can really count and you're left with your severity scores,

302
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:37,470
you might have to apply a regression analysis strategy to get some statistical evaluation, which is a little bit more difficult.

303
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:43,080
So essentially what you're doing here is you're trying to say, which of my independent variables.

304
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:50,220
So my dose group has a significant effect on the dependent variable, which is severity.

305
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:50,920
Yeah.

306
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:59,640
And I can do that either categorically like which of my dose variables has a significant effect on just inflammation, like whether it occurs or not.

307
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:09,780
Or I can incorporate an optimal aspect to the dependent variable so I can see essentially a correlation in doses increasing as severity is increasing.

308
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:16,110
So this is a regression strategy. It's more complicated statistical.

309
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:21,350
So it's harder to apply. Multiple assumptions must be met to construct the model.

310
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:27,820
So usually this is something you would do in combination with a statistician, or if you had a fair amount of statistical expertise yourself.

311
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:34,600
And the the assumptions for the model are more stringent than for our standard parametric tests.

312
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:43,600
And also, if I want to incorporate severity, the assumptions were ordinal data in the dependent variable are more stringent than if it's categorical.

313
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:47,559
So this is really non monotonic dose response relationships.

314
00:31:47,560 --> 00:32:00,400
Or you could I mean, I think I've most commonly just seen this with standard dose just to assess whether it truly is a dose dependent response.

315
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:08,340
And it's also really hard in histology data because if you have small numbers because sometimes you just are too few alphas.

316
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:13,299
So mostly I've seen this in experimental biology where we have larger cohorts,

317
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:17,980
larger numbers of animals, and we do think that there's a dose dependance to our response.

318
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:22,359
But where we have complex dose relationships, I'm sure there probably is a way to do it.

319
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:28,000
I just don't have as much. I haven't seen that as much or read about it as much, so I'm not sure.

320
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:37,990
So anyway, so this is something done most often in like a discovery phase in drug discovery or where you're trying to assess efficacy of a candidate

321
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:47,260
pharmaceutical or an experimental biology in regulatory or industrial types path they choose typically choose to sidestep strategy.

322
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:53,740
So this is national toxicology program data. So this chart has kind of a typical NCPDP chart.

323
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:57,190
They're putting the number of out of tissues examined per group.

324
00:32:57,190 --> 00:33:00,339
So this is stomach of all different things, stomach.

325
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:05,739
This is the number examined per group. And then they'll list the number of tissues with a lesion.

326
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:12,280
So this was epithelial hyperplasia. Four out of the ten showed that finding and then they'll put the severity data.

327
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:17,230
But this is our summary chart. So this is every even just an average severity data.

328
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:20,410
This is one mile in parentheses.

329
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:25,060
They don't evaluate that statistically. The only thing they compare statistically is the incidence,

330
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:31,719
and that's probably because it just would be a lot of work to try to model every single one of those.

331
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:37,600
And the important thing here is incidence and then they would just visually look and see if there's a dose dependance.

332
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:45,010
Yes, they did. The average for the severity is, you know, despite again not being like a linear scale kind of thing.

333
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:55,750
Yeah. So I think yeah, I mean, I think you have to measure like kind of what's the ideal of what gets you the most information with the time,

334
00:33:56,620 --> 00:34:01,720
because time costs you with the time it would take to do that and the complexity.

335
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:06,069
So in A.P that or like in contract research,

336
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:12,639
this chart is going to go to somebody else to interpret and it gets really complicated when you start

337
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:19,959
incorporating those models like this in a way is easier to understand if you need to make that assessment.

338
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:25,660
So you can look at this quickly and you can kind of get a sense of the ones that you might think maybe there is some dose dependance,

339
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:31,059
so then you might choose to go back to those, you know, let's eyeball all the data.

340
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:38,110
Well, this is the important part. Now, I'm going to do some more rigorous statistics on that parameter to see if it's really holds up.

341
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:41,950
So I guess that's probably it's just expedient. This is easy to do.

342
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:45,879
That is a little bit more complicated. But there is also raw data.

343
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:49,990
Remember, we talked about reports in the back of all this is page by page of raw data.

344
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:56,410
So you can go back there dot one and you can see what it is for each individual animal if you think that might be an issue.

345
00:34:56,530 --> 00:35:05,080
But this simplifies the data presentation, I think. Yeah, so that's A.P and it's very similar for regulatory talks most of the time.

346
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:10,390
So there's your bare essentials remembering slide about what to do for statistics of histology.

347
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:19,060
And then this is our study. So statistical analysis was not applied to the histology in the study.

348
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:25,480
We had enough other data that we could apply statistics to and the take home point.

349
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:30,940
But the main question was, did the vaccine make disease more or less?

350
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:39,250
Did the vaccine make disease less than the control? And that was we didn't need statistics to tell us that it was at least as bad, if not worse.

351
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:44,140
So it wouldn't really add any additional information. We have some small groups which would make it difficult.

352
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:47,590
And this was just the summary findings. All right.

353
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:53,450
So that is statistics. Okay.

354
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:58,520
You go to my other point. So that was finishing up the middle portion of module six.

355
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:08,600
And the important point for that for your papers is just knowing that we didn't apply statistics to our histology data in our paper.

356
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,760
So you don't have to write anything about that.

357
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:19,130
I mean, you should write that we didn't write them, but there is no additional data to present their for your quiz.

358
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:24,620
You know, the bare essentials slides that I talked about. We'll go over that when we do the little quiz recap.

359
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:34,310
Whatever you were doing that next week, next week, so that some of that information, just which the didactic segment was really good.

360
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:41,810
Okay. Thank you. I'm glad to be here. Okay.

361
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:45,109
Because I have my time constraint. I'm going to go forward.

362
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:50,630
But anyone you know, can you take a little bit of a break, feel free to run from the room.

363
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:52,999
So I'm just going to go for it.

364
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:59,330
But because I have a time constraint today, I'm just going to just I understand if you need to flee the room at any moment.

365
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:01,700
Okay. So this was from the beginning.

366
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:10,189
We were going to design, conduct your report, and we will study to address a certain objective, which is a preclinical vaccine study.

367
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:18,380
And we were going to assess efficacy and toxicity. These were our results, toxicity, everything, great efficacy.

368
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:22,339
We didn't get as high serum neutralizing antibodies as we wanted.

369
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:28,940
And although we lowered the pulmonary virus, titer disease was just as worse, if not slightly worse than natural infection.

370
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:32,600
So non effective. This was the pull back.

371
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:39,620
The curtain virus, respiratory syncytial virus that we talked about was the leading cause of pneumonia

372
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:44,630
and bronchiolitis in young children and can sometimes cause severe illness or death.

373
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:50,750
Also, there's some effect on older people, particularly nowadays.

374
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:55,489
It's kind of more prevalent. And I show I shared that the vaccine that we study,

375
00:37:55,490 --> 00:38:05,059
the data that we were studying were for some from some animal studies designed to piece out the mechanism of this horrible event in the 1960s for we

376
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:16,460
had an increase or enhanced disease in immunized children in a late stage clinical trial using an alum precipitated formalin inactivated vaccine.

377
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:22,340
So that was the event. And then these animals are from later work that was done trying to piece together the mechanism.

378
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:26,780
And as we said, that event had a major effect on vaccine development.

379
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:35,000
And the occurrence of this antibody enhanced or vaccine enhanced disease is always a major concern in vaccine development even today.

380
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,709
And I have a couple of slides at the end,

381
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:44,270
this actually sort of making sure that something like this would have happened was a major concern in the development of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine,

382
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:50,720
because I can only imagine how terrible that would be. So corporates were our animal model.

383
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:53,630
And so when you're writing your introduction, you're going to want to intrude.

384
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:58,819
So when you're writing your introduction, you're going to want to introduce the idea. RSV is an important disease.

385
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:05,360
Here are some reasons why we're going to study this in an animal model.

386
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:11,059
The animal model we've chosen our rats. Here are some reasons we chose such a kind of strange animal model.

387
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:17,510
So this is just about what they are. And this explains some of the reasons why we chose a cotton rat.

388
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:22,100
One of the reasons why in the 60, there are several reasons,

389
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:27,889
but one of the reasons why that adverse effect was not picked up in the sixties is the animal models that we're using

390
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:35,930
to test the efficacy didn't really respond both to challenge infection and to vaccination the same way a human would.

391
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:39,830
So they weren't a good model of the disease in the first place,

392
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:44,480
so they didn't tend to have the more severe manifestations of RSV infection in the first place.

393
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:50,930
So it was hard for them to replicate the exacerbation of infection upon being given vaccine cotton rats.

394
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:56,090
For some reason our view was that a lot of respiratory viral models there, an influenza model as well.

395
00:39:56,990 --> 00:40:01,910
So that's some background data. On why this was an example.

396
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:11,090
Aside from the paper showing the comparison, this is autopsy data sadly from one of the infants that died of bronchiolitis.

397
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:17,000
So the top is the infant. This is a bronchial. You can't even hardly tell because the epithelium is completely gone.

398
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:21,620
And here is an inflammatory argument around the bronchial and invading that epithelium.

399
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:26,389
And then part of the hard part is just mechanics for really young infants.

400
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:31,219
Their bronchioles are so small and it also is very collapsible.

401
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:35,270
So once you have this happen, you can't really get air to the deeper portions of the lung.

402
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:44,450
And then they also had inflammatory cells in the alveolar spaces, which is the finding that is very difficult to replicate in a in an animal model.

403
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:51,430
And the cotton rat is one that does get this. So they get a more robust bronchial response and they get inflammatory cells in.

404
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:55,630
I'll be alive. This was our.

405
00:40:55,810 --> 00:41:01,390
These were our results. So this was that virus challenge alone.

406
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:04,719
So I probably should have zoomed in a little at low magnification.

407
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:10,540
You can hardly even tell there's anything going on with that lung or very mild increase in the bronchial.

408
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:13,660
And lymphocytes around the bronchioles basically was fine.

409
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:21,220
And then in the vaccinated animals there was a little bit of expansion of that para bronchial infiltrate.

410
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:24,370
And if you looked at the airways just adjacent,

411
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:29,770
the inflammatory infiltrate is actually pushing out and thickening the interstitial adjacent to the bronchial.

412
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:35,559
So spreading from the bronchioles, it's a little bit worse. Those were our results.

413
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:38,140
So that's on canvas as well. There's the the Allied US.

414
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:49,390
And then we also said that this is also from that Prince paper immunization increases both whoopsie both

415
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:58,060
th2 so humoral and anti one or inflammatory cytokines responses in comparison to natural infection.

416
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:07,000
So in that sense, it's an impulse stimulatory effect, but it's really increasing the cytokines above even what a natural infection would.

417
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:16,300
So that's like into number one. So in terms of mechanism, how could this exacerbation or enhancement of disease happen?

418
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:18,190
So this is kind of where we left off.

419
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:26,330
So we showed this slide initially, and this is a list of all the different adverse things that can happen with vaccination.

420
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:34,910
The first one is crossed out because obviously if it doesn't work, that's adverse, but it's an efficacy problem, not a toxicity problem.

421
00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:41,480
But we started with like local toxicity, which is adverse, but it doesn't explain what was happening in the lung.

422
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:45,979
We have to kind of get to the lot of that. We talked about the potential.

423
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:53,780
If you have an antigen that resembles a host protein, you could induce an immune response against your own tissues.

424
00:42:54,200 --> 00:43:04,399
So it's an autoimmune induction, but if that were the case, we would most likely see this in the toxicity study and we didn't see anything there.

425
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:09,860
So it seems unlikely. And now we have some two we have two other mechanisms that could be at play.

426
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:13,040
These have some similarities, subtle differences.

427
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:20,600
But the first one, I change the wording slightly here because there's a subtlety to this that the wording helps you understand.

428
00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:26,900
So the first one of these mechanisms is if you have antibody dependent enhancement of infection.

429
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:34,190
So this is where the antibody is actually going to help the virus get inside cells remain in the body and proliferate.

430
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:39,680
So you're enhancing infections working in cohort with the virus and sneakily enhancing infection.

431
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:49,580
So how might that happen? So here's our slide from Immune Lecture, looking at the many ways that antibodies can attack microbes.

432
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:54,560
And we said that one way that attacks microbes is by directly neutralizing them.

433
00:43:55,100 --> 00:44:00,110
So that means usually binding like a cell receptor so it can't get into cells anymore.

434
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:07,040
The binding, some receptor that's important for its invasion into cells and then it can just get cleaned up by macrophages and things.

435
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:12,349
So one thing would be neutralization fails and virus persists.

436
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:17,810
And we have some evidence of this because we have the low level of serum neutralizing antibodies.

437
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:25,610
The antibody in that instance where you have antibodies but they're not neutralizing the antibodies,

438
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:29,360
actually help facilitate phagocytosis by macrophages.

439
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:30,170
Remember,

440
00:44:30,350 --> 00:44:38,840
because you have a virus that's bound by an antibody and then the macrophage has receptors that recognize the constant region of the antibody.

441
00:44:39,350 --> 00:44:47,290
So the macrophage is recognizing not the virus itself, but the antibody bound to it, and that triggers it to phagocytosis and take in that virus.

442
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:51,770
So it helps the antibody, helps the macrophages go up that virus.

443
00:44:52,850 --> 00:44:56,360
So how can that go wrong? So this is a diagram.

444
00:44:56,370 --> 00:45:01,550
This is also a nice review for these enhanced disease mechanisms.

445
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:06,470
So this is something called antibody dependent enhancement of infection.

446
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:12,140
And what happens we have just like we just describe antibody, antibody binding virus.

447
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:19,880
So now there's a virus, essentially an antigen antibody complex and that actually is recognized.

448
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:27,380
The antibody itself is recognized by another cell, and the presence of that antibody facilitates phagocytosis.

449
00:45:27,590 --> 00:45:33,790
The most common cell type and the most common receptor that does this of common cell type is the macrophage.

450
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:43,370
And the most common receptor is the FC receptor, which is for that constant region on the antibody because these are large complexes.

451
00:45:43,670 --> 00:45:49,820
So depending on how the antibody binds and what type of antibody it is, it's a kind of large complex on the cell surface.

452
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:54,620
And one thing that can happen is it actually can interact with adjacent receptors.

453
00:45:55,400 --> 00:46:03,260
So when a macrophage binds, it can either bind and be activated and take something into the cell or can bind and take something in,

454
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:06,890
but it simultaneously can have binding to an inhibitory receptor.

455
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:11,390
And that's telling the macrophage that this is relatively innocuous and this is okay.

456
00:46:12,050 --> 00:46:17,210
So it has mechanisms for down regulating inflammation.

457
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:22,490
And this comes into play both in this abnormal mechanism, but also in regular disease.

458
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:29,840
For example, if I have a lot of neutralizing antibody, so I'm fighting the virus, the virus is inactive.

459
00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:35,210
So now I have virus floating around but with antibodies attached to it and I got to clean it up.

460
00:46:35,690 --> 00:46:43,960
So I want the macrophages to phagocytosis that, but I don't want them to go too crazy and create a lot of other inflammatory response.

461
00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:48,530
I want them to just clean up the mess and then transition to normal structure.

462
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:57,020
So if you have large antigen antibody complexes, it's advantageous to have some binding of an inhibitory receptor.

463
00:46:57,020 --> 00:47:04,370
And what'll happen is almost toss it, it'll break it down, but you won't get strong induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

464
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:09,380
So as part of that cleanup response and kind of part of that switch towards an end to phenotype.

465
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:13,040
I'm going to grab a clean up and then I'm just going to dampen things down.

466
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:19,250
So that's part of natural infection. If I have these non rich, but in that case I have a neutral.

467
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:24,900
I think everybody are. The other thing that's happening is there is a less regular virus floating around to infect cells.

468
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:28,770
Okay. If I have non neutralizing antibody and I take it in,

469
00:47:28,770 --> 00:47:35,310
I want the macrophage to be activated because I want more information to help get rid of the virus that's circulating.

470
00:47:35,850 --> 00:47:43,980
So if you have binding of this inhibitory receptor, the virus can actually because of this inhibition,

471
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:48,090
you're down regulating production of protein inflammatory cytokines,

472
00:47:48,090 --> 00:47:53,969
you're down really regulating production of interferons that would normally normally kill virus and

473
00:47:53,970 --> 00:48:00,990
you're actually facilitating virus survival even inside the cell itself as a little on cell type.

474
00:48:01,590 --> 00:48:06,540
But now macrophages in the site of infection can travel in lymphatics to the lymph node.

475
00:48:07,170 --> 00:48:15,450
In the lymph node. They can get spread to the blood. And now this mechanism can actually facilitate virus transport elsewhere in the body.

476
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:21,390
So if the virus antigen antibody complexes are bound and the macrophages are not activated,

477
00:48:21,390 --> 00:48:25,170
the macrophages become sort of a Trojan horse for spreading it to other areas.

478
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:35,460
The best example of this is a disease called feline infectious peritonitis, which is the cat version of a coronavirus infection.

479
00:48:36,570 --> 00:48:40,770
So this virus has been around for a long time and actually is used in some context to

480
00:48:40,770 --> 00:48:45,600
model the the sort of spectrum of disease that happens with human coronavirus infection.

481
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:49,800
It's a different type of coronavirus, though. But what happened with this?

482
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:58,800
This is a disease that can be mild, but it can cause sort of a systemic infection that causes inflammation in a variety of body organs.

483
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:06,300
And there was a vaccine for this that came out, I think, in the eighties that unfortunately actually made the disease worse.

484
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:09,750
So cats that were vaccinated with this then became infected,

485
00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:15,090
actually got worse disease and poor outcomes than animals that just had natural infection.

486
00:49:15,570 --> 00:49:20,700
And it was because the virus itself is naturally suited to survive inside macrophages.

487
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,660
And the vaccine induced antibodies helped it enter more macrophages.

488
00:49:25,110 --> 00:49:28,260
So the macrophages spread it all over and the animals did much worse.

489
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:35,880
It's really not a good thing at all. So that's an example of antibody dependent enhancement of infection.

490
00:49:36,210 --> 00:49:41,220
And the net downstream effectiveness of all this stuff is you have more virus,

491
00:49:42,330 --> 00:49:45,719
you're spreading it to different organs and the viral numbers are up because

492
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:50,820
you're down regulating everything that would ordinarily drop their numbers down.

493
00:49:52,330 --> 00:49:56,590
It's under my bed it's there increases the amount of so in our study.

494
00:49:57,010 --> 00:50:00,819
That's a very nice plausible mechanism worth looking at. But in our study,

495
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:07,900
the piece of evidence that we have that argues against this being present is in our lung tissue to you remember our pulmonary lung titers.

496
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:13,209
We did actually have a decreasing amount of virus, so our disease was worse,

497
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:21,130
but we did seem to have some effect downregulate virus that makes this mechanism not applicable to what happened with ours.

498
00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:27,160
So that brings us to another type of antibody dependent enhancement.

499
00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:34,060
And just a word here about monoculture. If you look up these mechanisms, the non-conservative is just a mess.

500
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:40,600
So you'll see articles that talk about ADC antibody dependent enhancement.

501
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:45,760
Some of those articles are entirely about what I just talked about enhancing infection.

502
00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:56,710
Other articles also addressed that you can have antibody dependent enhancement of disease itself and are going to have a slightly different mechanism.

503
00:50:58,210 --> 00:51:02,420
And other articles don't use that terminology for this at all.

504
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:05,590
They call it just this and they call this immuno pathology.

505
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:12,530
So you kind of got to understand the mechanisms, but just know that this terminology is still kind of in flux.

506
00:51:12,550 --> 00:51:18,070
It's getting a little bit more standardized now with more attention on vaccines, like with COVID vaccines.

507
00:51:18,370 --> 00:51:21,670
But Adi, just be careful that you understand what they're talking about.

508
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:32,020
That mechanism of hiding in cells is pretty strictly enhancement of infection, and then enhanced disease doesn't necessarily utilize that mechanism.

509
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:40,720
Okay. So we're going to talk about immuno pathology or hypersensitivity and specifically antibody dependent enhancement of disease.

510
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:45,970
Okay. So how would that happen? So some of it looks the same.

511
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:49,959
Again, we have a lack of neutralizing antibodies, but again,

512
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:57,400
that doesn't preclude phagocytosis of the antibodies, the non neutralizing antibodies bound to virus.

513
00:51:57,880 --> 00:51:59,980
So it can facilitate phagocytosis.

514
00:52:00,670 --> 00:52:09,790
If you have infected cells that infected epithelial cells, the presence of viral antigens or the presence of others was,

515
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:15,760
I can say the presence of antibody will actually flag certain cells for NK cell killing

516
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:22,690
so it can increase cytotoxicity and virus antibody complexes can activate complement.

517
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:26,649
So these are all the other normal mechanisms for getting for antibody,

518
00:52:26,650 --> 00:52:32,620
helping get rid of microbes that can be enhanced actually by the presence of antibody.

519
00:52:33,310 --> 00:52:42,700
So essentially in immuno pathology, we're ramping up those responses and we're getting collateral damage because those responses are so

520
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:49,470
strong and there's no concurrent decrease in the number of virus like just from neutralizing antibody.

521
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:55,240
So we have enhanced phagocytosis and complement lysis due to antibody binding.

522
00:52:55,570 --> 00:53:04,950
And the end result is an inflammatory response. And then we have enhanced antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity.

523
00:53:04,950 --> 00:53:10,460
So an and K cell comes along and sees all this antibody on the surface of a cell and kills those cells.

524
00:53:10,470 --> 00:53:14,190
So you get cytokine release and more severe tissue damage and inflammation.

525
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:23,070
So again, you're using that cellular, the kind of inflammatory aspect of an antibody driven microbe killing,

526
00:53:23,070 --> 00:53:26,610
but you don't at the same time have a strong neutralizing response.

527
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:34,769
And in the lung, you can imagine it's an airway in the airways and in the areas of gas exchange.

528
00:53:34,770 --> 00:53:40,710
Having all these inflammatory cells has a very strong negative effect on tissue function.

529
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:48,100
Okay, so how is this mechanism applicable to our formalin inactivated RSV vaccines?

530
00:53:50,040 --> 00:54:00,930
So this vaccine was alum adjuvanted and alum or aluminum is a adjuvant that is designed to induce ath2 dominant response.

531
00:54:01,470 --> 00:54:07,620
So it's designed to have a good antibody response is that's thought to be what you need to get rid of the virus.

532
00:54:07,950 --> 00:54:11,370
So we're already biased towards antibody production.

533
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:15,800
And then was it the same?

534
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:24,980
Normal immune response involves production of low and high affinity antibodies here where biasing towards antibody production.

535
00:54:25,490 --> 00:54:31,799
But because the antibody that we're producing is not effective or we're one not getting

536
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:36,950
a decrease in viral numbers and we're having a strong inflammatory response and that's

537
00:54:36,950 --> 00:54:41,540
going to kill some virus infected cells and decrease the amount of virus and the

538
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:46,040
amount of antibodies that get for the presentation that gets to the germinal centers.

539
00:54:46,310 --> 00:54:54,830
So the net effect is that we have early response of low affinity antibodies with poor

540
00:54:54,830 --> 00:55:00,950
neutralization efficacy and we never really transition to the mature high affinity response.

541
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:09,480
Part of this is because of the nature of antigen in our vaccine.

542
00:55:10,230 --> 00:55:14,280
So if I have a whole virus in natural infection, the virus gets killed.

543
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:21,630
There's a ton of different antigens present and the body can kind of pick and choose which antigens are highest affinity and most effective.

544
00:55:21,990 --> 00:55:28,650
So over time, it's going to stick with the clones that are most effective and utilize those to protect against future infection.

545
00:55:30,450 --> 00:55:38,490
When I inactivated my virus with formalin, one of the things that form one does as we know from fixation is crosslink surface antigens.

546
00:55:39,510 --> 00:55:48,419
So cross-linking certain surface antigens changes the confirmation and depending on how that conformation changes, that might not be as effective.

547
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:57,630
A signal for immune development. So formalin inactive inactivation cross-linked surface antigens which prevents affinity maturation.

548
00:55:58,230 --> 00:56:01,560
And basically you made a less immunogenic antigen.

549
00:56:03,330 --> 00:56:09,810
And because you're not giving a whole viable virus, this isn't going to replicate.

550
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:14,340
You're not going to get usually a virus infects a cell, then it changes its gene expression.

551
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:20,400
You get a whole other repertoire of antigens, some of which will induce a stronger immune response.

552
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:27,630
So when this inactivated virus used in our vaccine, a smaller repertoire of viral antigens is available.

553
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:32,310
So the antibody response remains low affinity and non neutralizing.

554
00:56:34,290 --> 00:56:40,409
So the vaccine induced antibody that we generated did not block binding of virus to the cells,

555
00:56:40,410 --> 00:56:43,640
but it did allow all these other downstream effects to happen.

556
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:51,360
So we still had phagocytosis and inflammation and that had a detrimental effect on the lung tissue.

557
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:53,519
So robust inflammatory response,

558
00:56:53,520 --> 00:57:02,429
essentially hypersensitivity or an exacerbation of the normal inflammatory response to infection and natural naturally virus infection.

559
00:57:02,430 --> 00:57:12,420
Like if this was a viable virus, it doesn't have this effect because there's a much larger repertoire of antigens available for immune stimulation.

560
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:17,370
Okay. So that was a lot of antibody related pathology.

561
00:57:18,090 --> 00:57:25,500
So one thought that might occur, is that okay, we had ath2 biased, you know, pro antibody vaccine.

562
00:57:26,010 --> 00:57:34,520
So what if we made a vaccine with an adjuvant that biased us towards a robust th1, which is a cell based pro-inflammatory response?

563
00:57:34,530 --> 00:57:37,590
Would that be safe? The answer is no.

564
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:44,159
And the reason is because two huge one biased responses can also cause a methodology just

565
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:50,670
directly because we're stimulating the T cells to drive a strong inflammatory response.

566
00:57:51,270 --> 00:57:56,370
So overly strong T cell based responses also can cause excessive tissue damage.

567
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:06,900
A couple examples of that. This is probably one of the most famous ones, which is involving a therapeutic antibody, not a preventative antibody.

568
00:58:08,010 --> 00:58:12,510
So this was an incident where there was a therapeutic antibody developed.

569
00:58:12,630 --> 00:58:16,950
So these are typically therapeutic antibodies are ones where they're given to treat a disease.

570
00:58:17,190 --> 00:58:22,710
So, you know, for cancer or for arthritis, some of them are immunomodulatory where you want to downregulate things.

571
00:58:23,070 --> 00:58:27,480
Others are to stimulate an immune response or to attack something directly.

572
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:34,410
But this was a trial looking at a monoclonal antibody that was intended for cancer therapy in rheumatoid arthritis.

573
00:58:34,770 --> 00:58:42,980
And it was actually intended. Remember, the pathology was intended to sort of downregulate modulatory T-cells.

574
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:54,540
So you were letting the regular immune. You wanted to avoid down regulating your immune response and let your immune system attack a cancer.

575
00:58:55,710 --> 00:58:58,950
The structure of this, this was what's called a super agonist.

576
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:05,370
So most antibodies have a variable zone that bind very specifically to a particular protein

577
00:59:05,370 --> 00:59:12,330
antigen on a T cell that's usually through very specific T cell receptors on the surface.

578
00:59:12,450 --> 00:59:21,660
This antibody had the capacity to activate or to bind to multiple clones of T cells because it actually bound on the outside of the T cell receptor.

579
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:26,370
So it wasn't clone specific, it could activate multiple clones of T cells.

580
00:59:26,820 --> 00:59:29,130
So you can probably already see where things went horribly wrong.

581
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:36,600
But in 2006, there was an early stage clinical trial to establish safety in a small number of healthy human volunteers.

582
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:40,140
There were eight volunteers to placebo.

583
00:59:40,650 --> 00:59:46,740
Unfortunately, all six of the vaccinated patients became acutely ill within 30 minutes of dosing,

584
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:56,490
and they ended up with essentially what the site called a cytokine storm where they actually had activation of multiple effector T cells,

585
00:59:56,490 --> 01:00:02,210
not T cell C sector T cells, all of which said okay and produce.

586
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:07,400
Large amounts of cytokine and they essentially went into multi systemic organ failure and shock.

587
01:00:08,030 --> 01:00:15,559
All these individuals were hospitalized and survived, thankfully, but because in shock you avert your circulation centrally.

588
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:21,080
They lost some peripheral circulation. So some individuals had some toes and several fingers amputated.

589
01:00:21,410 --> 01:00:27,920
So again, in the history of things going wrong in clinical trials, this is one of the worse outcomes.

590
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:30,739
The pathogenesis of this, as I said,

591
01:00:30,740 --> 01:00:37,490
was through those multiple forms of T-cells and generated an overwhelming cytokine response that caused multiple organ failure.

592
01:00:38,030 --> 01:00:46,520
So if you overstimulated one group in response, particular in this context or as multiple clones, you can have pathology as a result of that as well.

593
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:55,810
This is if you ever get the chance. This is a really good analysis of this event and talks past over like a whole class based on this.

594
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:59,960
Now it's condensed to one slide, but essentially the criticism in this article,

595
01:01:00,450 --> 01:01:04,609
this is very controversial is a lot of things that were written about this criticism in this

596
01:01:04,610 --> 01:01:09,620
one is that the animal models that they use to test this and if you have a super agonist,

597
01:01:09,620 --> 01:01:12,379
if you know it's a super agonist, what you should see,

598
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:19,640
the physiologic effect of the super redness is you should actually see a spike and then a decrease in teeth,

599
01:01:19,670 --> 01:01:25,040
or you should see a certain pattern of proliferation in T cells and a certain spike in cytokines.

600
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:29,630
If you don't see that the molecule is not an effective super agonist.

601
01:01:30,170 --> 01:01:33,130
When they did their animal studies, they were focused on toxicity.

602
01:01:33,650 --> 01:01:41,720
They didn't have toxicity great, but they didn't have the physiologic effect of a super agonist.

603
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:50,480
And what that should tell you is that your animal model is not replicating physiologically what this molecule is going to do in the human.

604
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:55,069
So in that instance, they were so focused on the safety aspects of the toxicity.

605
01:01:55,070 --> 01:01:59,360
Good, we have no adverse effects. That doesn't make any sense.

606
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:01,370
If you don't have the physiologic response,

607
01:02:01,370 --> 01:02:08,300
the reason you have no effect is because the molecules not doing in your animal model what it's going to do in the human.

608
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:16,640
And later they found out that this was because of a difference in the type of T cells in the periphery of their rhesus monkey animal model.

609
01:02:16,670 --> 01:02:22,250
I think this raises or said, okay remember is our monkey animal model had a difference in t cell distribution patterns.

610
01:02:22,580 --> 01:02:26,209
So this could not occur in the animal model, but it did in the humans.

611
01:02:26,210 --> 01:02:30,530
And it was a this is a pretty pointed article talking about why it's so important.

612
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:34,940
You're not just looking give it to an animal is because the animal, it's more than that.

613
01:02:34,940 --> 01:02:38,920
You have to make sure that the animal model physiologically matches what's going to happen.

614
01:02:38,990 --> 01:02:40,730
The event. This is a really good article.

615
01:02:41,690 --> 01:02:48,620
So what ath1 biased vaccine be less risky for RSV development because we talked about all this antibody stuff.

616
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:56,809
This has been tried. So in mouse models, high dose vaccination with F protein,

617
01:02:56,810 --> 01:03:04,850
which is the fusion protein on the surface of the RSV virus that fuzes it with the cell membrane to allow cell entry at a tier one.

618
01:03:04,850 --> 01:03:12,739
Biasing adjuvant was protective, but if they modulated the dose of the vaccination and used the same adjuvant

619
01:03:12,740 --> 01:03:19,399
that resulted again in enhanced disease and the reason was essentially because

620
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:29,660
the low dose vaccinate the it was th1 bias to generate a robust inflammatory response that actually really effectively and quickly killed the virus.

621
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:40,820
But you didn't have in this instance enough antibody persistence or antigen resistance that you could mature the neutralizing antibody response.

622
01:03:41,420 --> 01:03:44,510
So again, it's kind of the same mechanism as in our study,

623
01:03:44,750 --> 01:03:52,100
but the reason that they didn't have those antibodies present is because the T cells came in too quickly and killed the killed virus,

624
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:58,550
and then the virus didn't persist long enough to allow maturation of the neutralizing antibody response.

625
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:04,640
So the take home for that is that th1th1 biased responses are not a panacea.

626
01:04:05,150 --> 01:04:09,710
Ideally, for an effective vaccine, you have to have a balance between the cell mediated,

627
01:04:09,950 --> 01:04:13,520
the inflammatory response and the neutralizing antibody response.

628
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:18,860
Okay. That mechanism, remember, is not going to be applicable for your vaccine.

629
01:04:19,310 --> 01:04:24,200
So don't explain this in detail in your discussion as a mechanism because ours was not one.

630
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:27,290
But it's telling you this because it's been done.

631
01:04:29,990 --> 01:04:35,830
Okay, so this summerside effect it for that aspect.

632
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:43,880
Effective vaccination in general means that you have to have effective th2 driven antibody generation so you can get both neutralizing antibody

633
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:51,830
and you can have antibody binding that assists the inflammatory response but is also accompanied or balanced by direct neutralization.

634
01:04:52,490 --> 01:05:02,120
And if you have ath1 immune response or th1 biased vaccine, which is actually necessary for some types of infection, you want to avoid excessive.

635
01:05:02,230 --> 01:05:09,200
Inflammation that can contribute to pathology. So as you can imagine, these two things.

636
01:05:09,220 --> 01:05:11,860
Antibody dependent infection.

637
01:05:11,860 --> 01:05:20,590
So allowing the virus to hide and antibody dependent enhanced disease are a major focus when you're developing a vaccine.

638
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:27,129
Right. Because we're giving this drug compound biologic to large numbers of healthy people.

639
01:05:27,130 --> 01:05:32,230
So the last thing we want to do is make things worse. So this is a short diagram.

640
01:05:32,230 --> 01:05:39,040
There are a couple of sources for this of just, you know, obviously recently recent interest in coronavirus,

641
01:05:39,370 --> 01:05:47,200
but the history of sort of coronaviruses and the relationship with antibody dependent enhancement of infection or disease.

642
01:05:47,620 --> 01:05:55,240
So I gave you the example of FIP and vaccine associated enhanced disease with a marketed vaccine that was recalled.

643
01:05:55,900 --> 01:06:05,500
But what was particularly alarming during the development of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is that in both Sars-cov-1 and in Murres,

644
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:09,550
so that was the other corona virus that causes acute outbreak.

645
01:06:09,970 --> 01:06:17,980
There is evidence for this occurrence for the enhancement of disease and enhanced infection in animal models.

646
01:06:18,250 --> 01:06:22,030
So both of those have been demonstrated fairly conclusively in animal models.

647
01:06:22,030 --> 01:06:27,880
So there was concern, at least for the theoretical possibility of this in the development of SARS-CoV-2.

648
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:35,590
And as it turns out, both in developmental,

649
01:06:35,590 --> 01:06:43,630
in vitro and in using now they have experiments where you can take serum from infected persons and sort of separate out into antibody types.

650
01:06:44,020 --> 01:06:51,040
And then you can look at different antigens like antibodies against certain viral antigens and test in vitro,

651
01:06:51,430 --> 01:06:55,030
whether those can block virus entry or facilitate virus entry.

652
01:06:55,870 --> 01:07:08,199
So in using those immune sera from patients, there's in vitro evidence that some antibodies do block or do enhance virus entry rather than block.

653
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:17,500
It so happens in vitro. But there is no evidence in animal models so far or in humans that these same antibodies generate enhanced infection.

654
01:07:18,190 --> 01:07:23,590
And probably that has to do with this is an artificial situation where you're just using one type of antibody.

655
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:29,410
In real life, you have a broad spectrum of different antigens and generate your antibody response.

656
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:36,850
So if this happens in a few, that's sort of in the wash and blocked by the greater neutralizing antibody effect.

657
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:43,360
And one piece of encouraging information while we were in sort of the race to develop the Kobe two vaccine,

658
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:49,660
is that before the vaccine was approved or even used in early clinical trials,

659
01:07:49,930 --> 01:07:58,480
we would take or it was effective for people who were severely ill with coronavirus vaccine, the use of immune serum from infected patients.

660
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:03,249
So you're taking serum from somebody who survives coronavirus infection on the presumption

661
01:08:03,250 --> 01:08:08,110
that it has a good antibody response and giving it to a severely infected person.

662
01:08:08,830 --> 01:08:15,010
So if there was an occurrence, you were doing that because you're in desperate situation, because that person's likely going to die.

663
01:08:15,670 --> 01:08:21,910
That actually worked fairly well and they didn't have any reports of enhancement of disease with that strategy.

664
01:08:22,300 --> 01:08:30,190
So that was very encouraging for the development of the vaccine. And then the other aspect is that with the RNA vaccine,

665
01:08:30,310 --> 01:08:36,219
all of the older strategies for vaccine development involve kind of crude manipulation of the

666
01:08:36,220 --> 01:08:42,480
antigenic stimulus so that fixing a virus with formalin and cross-linking a surface receptor,

667
01:08:42,490 --> 01:08:50,740
some change in the conformation is something that natively you would never have formalin floating virus around and or I'm

668
01:08:50,740 --> 01:08:58,990
making a recombinant protein in a cell culture and there's a lot of stuff that can be carried along with that target antigen.

669
01:08:58,990 --> 01:09:05,050
When you're growing in a culture or when you're, I don't know, irradiating or formalin fixing a vaccine.

670
01:09:05,380 --> 01:09:10,840
So some of the animal models, especially in the earlier vaccines like things against RSV,

671
01:09:10,990 --> 01:09:14,979
some of the thought is that some of the non neutralizing antibodies are actually

672
01:09:14,980 --> 01:09:20,350
against either altered antigen or stuff that came along with the vaccine.

673
01:09:20,350 --> 01:09:24,820
That's antigenic but is not the receptor of interest.

674
01:09:25,390 --> 01:09:27,490
So maybe you got a really good immune response,

675
01:09:27,490 --> 01:09:34,899
but it's just some altered protein antigen or some aspect of the preparation that's not going to be neutralizing for regular virus,

676
01:09:34,900 --> 01:09:42,790
but it could contribute to this problem of non-natural antibodies and RNA vaccines are very, very clean compared to this.

677
01:09:43,450 --> 01:09:45,489
So you might have had this in other classes,

678
01:09:45,490 --> 01:09:54,310
but an RNA vaccine basically works by giving a segment of M RNA that encodes for the virus antigen of interest.

679
01:09:54,820 --> 01:10:01,030
So in the case of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, right, that binds to its receptor on the target cell, sort of.

680
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:10,540
I'm standing in way. Okay. So the marinade gets taken into the cell in the in most of our SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.

681
01:10:10,550 --> 01:10:16,100
This isn't a lipid nanoparticle, so it gets fuzed with the cell membrane taken into the cell,

682
01:10:16,550 --> 01:10:20,960
and then the RNA is going to co-opt the cellular machinery.

683
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:29,360
So it's going to read that as if it were a cell protein and actually expressed the virus protein or a fragment of it on the surface of the cell.

684
01:10:30,230 --> 01:10:35,900
So you're using kind of a biologic mechanism and especially designed everyday to code just that protein.

685
01:10:36,050 --> 01:10:40,340
You don't have to worry about stabilizing a protein antigen external to the body.

686
01:10:40,340 --> 01:10:46,370
You don't worry about growing something in culture or in bacteria. You're expressing a pretty clean antigen.

687
01:10:46,910 --> 01:10:55,670
And the target you're going to make sure that whatever your target is is highly antibody against it is highly neutralizing.

688
01:10:56,300 --> 01:11:00,020
So when you test this, you're not just not going to go forward with something that's not neutralizing.

689
01:11:00,020 --> 01:11:05,120
So you have a chance to make an antibody response that's very clean and highly likely to be neutralizing.

690
01:11:05,690 --> 01:11:09,649
So if you have a vaccine that generates a high proportion of neutralizing antibodies,

691
01:11:09,650 --> 01:11:13,250
it's very unlikely to see antibody dependent disease enhancement.

692
01:11:13,580 --> 01:11:16,850
And so, again, the choice of target protein is very important.

693
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:20,540
So if you picked the wrong target protein. Hirsh. Here, sure.

694
01:11:20,540 --> 01:11:25,010
Yes, you could have that. But you're just a much better control over what you're actually targeting.

695
01:11:26,150 --> 01:11:37,610
But yes, this was always my intention with the COVID vaccine, because I understand it's manufacturing like the spike protein of the surface membrane.

696
01:11:38,060 --> 01:11:43,670
But don't I mean, the viruses mutate all the time like that spike protein would be subject to so many mutations.

697
01:11:43,670 --> 01:11:47,309
And so, yes, like this is problematic, right? It is wrong.

698
01:11:47,310 --> 01:11:54,830
The same thing. But like you think influenza vaccine, you make a new version of the influenza vaccine every year based on which strains are extant.

699
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:58,480
So what aren't those based off of the prior years. Yeah.

700
01:11:58,510 --> 01:12:02,709
So, so then I guess, yeah, there's a couple of things.

701
01:12:02,710 --> 01:12:08,140
So one, ideally you don't want a vaccine that you're going to change.

702
01:12:08,150 --> 01:12:13,250
Like every single time a new strain comes around, the virus can mutate that spike protein.

703
01:12:13,250 --> 01:12:19,160
But that spike protein is really important to that virus. It's geared towards binding a very specific receptor.

704
01:12:19,490 --> 01:12:22,730
So it's kind of critical to that virus's life cycle.

705
01:12:23,630 --> 01:12:28,430
The structure of that protein in that receptor combination is critical to the virus's life cycle.

706
01:12:28,670 --> 01:12:33,620
So there is constraints like from a mutation aspect on how much it can mutate that spike protein.

707
01:12:34,160 --> 01:12:38,330
And like even though we draw this as a little diagram, there's many aspects to that protein.

708
01:12:38,330 --> 01:12:45,739
So you can have mutations, you're going to mutations in the spike protein that prevent it from binding its receptor.

709
01:12:45,740 --> 01:12:49,670
But those viruses aren't going to survive because now they can't enter cells.

710
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:58,880
So if I if I'm a virus, I have constraints on how much I can mutate that cells that spike protein and still survive.

711
01:12:58,910 --> 01:13:04,580
So it would be kind of there's conserved areas of the spike protein or conserved residues.

712
01:13:05,690 --> 01:13:11,580
And if I'm making a virus that if I'm making a vaccine,

713
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:18,709
one target would be conserved areas of the spike protein because I know that those are unlikely to have

714
01:13:18,710 --> 01:13:24,710
much change because the virus has to be able to bind its target receptor in order to get into its cell.

715
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:27,889
So I know that that's an important target.

716
01:13:27,890 --> 01:13:35,330
And if I can if I can pretend to be the receptor essentially and bind that area that it would use to get to its target cell,

717
01:13:35,690 --> 01:13:43,220
I'm going to prevent it from binding to its target cell and it's unlikely to be able to evade because of it changes those residues.

718
01:13:43,730 --> 01:13:47,540
That's great. My antibody won't bind, but it also can't get into its target cell.

719
01:13:48,710 --> 01:13:51,470
Yeah, so we'll just have to know. Sure.

720
01:13:52,850 --> 01:14:03,410
So additionally with if it's going to manufacture this antibody against the protein and you are designing a target protein,

721
01:14:03,530 --> 01:14:10,129
like wouldn't you have to be like super duper sure that you the target protein that you were designing,

722
01:14:10,130 --> 01:14:14,330
did it resemble anything else that was like in your body? Yes. So how do you do that?

723
01:14:14,780 --> 01:14:19,670
So that was our second mechanism in our list of adverse things that can go wrong.

724
01:14:20,030 --> 01:14:28,280
So if you have if I'm vaccinating with something that resembles a host antigen, one of two things can happen.

725
01:14:28,790 --> 01:14:34,850
Either I won't get an antibody response because my body's going to be like self protein.

726
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,290
So when I'm testing that,

727
01:14:36,290 --> 01:14:42,650
I'm not going to get an antibody response because it's not going to recognize that my immune system is not going to recognize that it's foreign.

728
01:14:43,220 --> 01:14:44,720
So from a drug development standpoint,

729
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:53,240
that's not something I'm going to go forward with because it's not effective at generating antibody response structurally.

730
01:14:53,420 --> 01:15:01,740
You can look at what the spike protein like, you know, you can look at the structure of the spike protein and see that sort of.

731
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:11,240
Structural assays, we could see if there's anything that might be a likely target, a likely target on a on a host immune cell.

732
01:15:11,630 --> 01:15:15,260
And during your preclinical toxicity testing.

733
01:15:15,260 --> 01:15:23,390
So one of the things in our study, if we had autoimmune antibody generation, we should see something even without challenge infection.

734
01:15:23,900 --> 01:15:31,640
So we should start to see if, if you like, if maybe use a really strong adjuvant and you induced an immune response against the cells protein,

735
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:40,520
you should see that adverse pathology in the absence of challenge because you've just trained yourself to recognize your own self,

736
01:15:40,550 --> 01:15:48,110
you're trained your immune system, recognize yourself as foreign, and then that stimulation, because your self proteins are always there,

737
01:15:48,110 --> 01:15:54,920
you're going to get pathology without virus challenge because your body's just you've essentially induced an autoimmune reaction.

738
01:15:55,400 --> 01:16:02,660
So in my vaccinated group, if I give them two vaccinations with my autoimmune inducing vaccine,

739
01:16:02,660 --> 01:16:06,560
I'm going to get an immune disease in the after the second immunization.

740
01:16:06,570 --> 01:16:16,190
Yeah. So I would see that that actually is a means if you want to induce a model of autoimmune disease, you could take like a myelin protein,

741
01:16:16,190 --> 01:16:21,469
which is myelin lining all your nerves and give it with a strong adjuvant and you

742
01:16:21,470 --> 01:16:26,330
can do some immune response against joints and against tissues in the arm body.

743
01:16:27,530 --> 01:16:39,439
So in development, if you have a target that's autoimmune immunogenic, you would see adverse effects in a toxicity study.

744
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:42,670
We're just vaccinating them. Yeah. Does that make sense?

745
01:16:42,730 --> 01:16:46,870
Yeah. Yeah. Okay, I'm. We're going to go to work and that's okay.

746
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:48,590
But I do. Okay.

747
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:57,470
It's very complex and like I guess it her to you about the spike protein that is generally true that's constrained by like conserved areas.

748
01:16:57,470 --> 01:17:02,470
Yeah. So like if the virus mutate, like that's a good area to target because it's important to their,

749
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:05,900
to the virus lifecycle and it's also less likely to be changed.

750
01:17:06,510 --> 01:17:14,569
Yeah. Year to year. That's a pretty simplistic answer because we know like with influenza there can be changes,

751
01:17:14,570 --> 01:17:23,389
that there can be changes that will affect my response to one vaccine that's given that still allows the virus to infect cells.

752
01:17:23,390 --> 01:17:31,549
So yes. And now we're seeing with our with SARS-CoV-2, with the al-Muqrin strain, some of the vaccines,

753
01:17:31,550 --> 01:17:39,050
like I think the AstraZeneca one is like essentially not effective against all the always kind of came out.

754
01:17:39,170 --> 01:17:43,310
It was like, oh, we got this one that works. Yeah. It's not like it has to do.

755
01:17:43,340 --> 01:17:51,770
You're striking a balance between how specific an antibody response you want to have and having it flexible enough that it's going to hit all,

756
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:52,210
you know,

757
01:17:52,220 --> 01:18:00,770
as many strains as you can that are out there, if not to completely knock it out, at least to hinder it enough so that disease is not as severe.

758
01:18:00,770 --> 01:18:05,690
Yeah, it's like just like flu. Like you can still get flu if you get your flu vaccine,

759
01:18:05,990 --> 01:18:10,760
but it's probably not going to knock you down to the extent that flu would if you were not immunized.

760
01:18:11,210 --> 01:18:16,430
So what is a balance? This is probably not your area of my life, although maybe somebody else.

761
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:20,750
So that's so important right now. And we just talking about this in advance.

762
01:18:21,110 --> 01:18:22,640
And I'm just curious, like,

763
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:31,190
is it theoretically possible that could reverse transpose back into the genome if it got close enough to other like machinery that and MRI.

764
01:18:31,730 --> 01:18:37,010
Yeah, because like that was what we were talking about as a model and it was like saying how

765
01:18:37,010 --> 01:18:43,370
pseudo genes are basically just mature and RNA and just that whenever they get near like,

766
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:49,520
well, I mean in order for me to go back into do you need like reverse transcriptase?

767
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:52,849
Yeah. So you borrow it from something that's like nearby.

768
01:18:52,850 --> 01:18:56,059
I don't know how this works at all, but I mean, it was random explained.

769
01:18:56,060 --> 01:19:01,670
Yeah, I'm like retro look up like retrovirus lifecycle because like, retroviruses do that.

770
01:19:01,670 --> 01:19:02,600
That's their strategy.

771
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:10,550
They have an RNA that gets in, you have a reverse transcriptase which plugs that into the genome, and that's how it sits in the genome.

772
01:19:11,180 --> 01:19:15,979
And then we actually, all of us have that's retroviruses.

773
01:19:15,980 --> 01:19:22,100
M0, there are endogenous retro, so there's pathogenic exogenous retroviruses.

774
01:19:22,100 --> 01:19:29,690
There are also endogenous retroviruses that back in in our evolutionary history, that's how we've acquired some of our genome.

775
01:19:29,690 --> 01:19:33,020
So some of the pseudo genes are actually thought to be remnants.

776
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:36,590
There's actually kind of two completely opposite ways of thinking about that.

777
01:19:36,890 --> 01:19:41,690
But some pseudo genes actually are thought to be remnants of endogenous retroviral sequences,

778
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:46,490
and some of those can actually splice themselves out and reinsert in other areas.

779
01:19:46,910 --> 01:19:52,790
So certain cancers actually work that way. You have a retroviral sequence that splices out re inserts itself,

780
01:19:52,790 --> 01:19:59,360
and if it's in front of another gene and apparently affects its transcription, yeah, it can.

781
01:19:59,450 --> 01:20:06,500
So it doesn't have that thing that would have to be within this. In order for it, it would have to be within the first tranche to do this,

782
01:20:06,550 --> 01:20:11,950
and it would have to be within the nucleus because it has to get to the to the DNA.

783
01:20:12,940 --> 01:20:18,370
So you would have to get your money. Most of the burden is going to be in the cytoplasm right where protein translation takes place.

784
01:20:18,730 --> 01:20:24,770
So you'd have to get your money back to the nucleus and you'd have to have a reverse transcriptase or some other means or like,

785
01:20:24,790 --> 01:20:28,240
I don't know, a DNA break and like, I don't know.

786
01:20:28,330 --> 01:20:32,590
Yeah, animal ligase and joining or something. Yeah, I understand synergies well enough.

787
01:20:32,650 --> 01:20:38,770
So maybe there are some nice mechanisms. Like if you look at retrovirus biology, like endogenous retroviruses,

788
01:20:38,770 --> 01:20:43,150
that's like a good starting point for understanding, like some gene splicing aspects.

789
01:20:43,660 --> 01:20:51,660
So that answer for me has a little bit anyway, but that does give you some sense that there are mechanisms by which RNA can go back into DNA.

790
01:20:51,670 --> 01:20:57,250
It's utilized by many viruses as part of their mechanism. But actually evolutionarily we do, like I said,

791
01:20:57,640 --> 01:21:08,440
have these sort of sequences that are in our DNA that they have been retrovirus origin and are just kept kind of moved from place to place.

792
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:12,530
The genome. Okay.

793
01:21:12,890 --> 01:21:15,630
Where are we going? Okay. We did this.

794
01:21:15,830 --> 01:21:24,410
We said that you still could have an adverse antibody dependent enhancement, but that's why the choice of your target protein is very important.

795
01:21:24,740 --> 01:21:31,340
And the cleanness of the prep makes it a little bit we're a little bit less likely that you're going to see something

796
01:21:31,340 --> 01:21:36,980
like that because of an alteration of the target protein or something that's carried along with the preparation.

797
01:21:37,790 --> 01:21:40,880
And interestingly, this is fascinating to me when I learn this.

798
01:21:41,090 --> 01:21:45,160
So Moderna, you know, I'm a Darren I like switched course the pandemic came.

799
01:21:45,410 --> 01:21:51,860
Switch course about the SARS-CoV-2 the background research done for that SARS-CoV-2 virus.

800
01:21:51,860 --> 01:21:57,590
Before SARS-CoV-2 ever came around, they were a vaccine development company for RSV.

801
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:02,900
They actually had a major program for developing an RSV vaccine, which, you know, was well needed,

802
01:22:03,110 --> 01:22:08,840
was strongly needed, but has been like on the back burner for decades because of that adverse event.

803
01:22:09,350 --> 01:22:17,510
So they took all that research and applied it to SARS-CoV-2 and now obviously are switching back their focus to RSV.

804
01:22:17,930 --> 01:22:23,629
So there are now four, I think vaccines in clinical trials or just finished multiple trials,

805
01:22:23,630 --> 01:22:28,100
some of them for RSV, one is Moderna's, which is an RNA based.

806
01:22:28,940 --> 01:22:33,740
There are maybe one other RNA based one. Pfizer has one, but I don't think it's in my name is I can't remember.

807
01:22:34,070 --> 01:22:39,710
Two are recombinant protein and one is like an adeno virus associated with a viral vector vaccine.

808
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:43,100
So RSV, as we talked about,

809
01:22:43,190 --> 01:22:49,910
probably because all the kids have been home for the poor pandemic babies born in 2020 and who haven't seen other human beings for like a year.

810
01:22:51,470 --> 01:22:55,820
All of those children have naive immune systems. Now they're going back to school or going back to daycare.

811
01:22:55,820 --> 01:22:59,920
So there's a huge surge in the incidence of RSV and it's pretty serious now.

812
01:22:59,930 --> 01:23:03,049
So this was which one was this? This was from nature,

813
01:23:03,050 --> 01:23:10,850
but there's been a couple articles in the popular press about RSV and now the multi technique

814
01:23:10,940 --> 01:23:19,729
technologies are being applied to RSV and the particular kind of aspect that was applied to RSV,

815
01:23:19,730 --> 01:23:25,280
the original vaccines. So I told you there's an F protein on RSV and that's the fusion protein.

816
01:23:25,640 --> 01:23:31,490
So the virus comes along, uses that protein to Fuze with the cell membrane and gain entry to the cell.

817
01:23:32,420 --> 01:23:38,690
But the act of that F protein interacting with the cell membrane changes the conformation.

818
01:23:38,900 --> 01:23:42,920
So it has a pre fusion and a post fusion conformation state.

819
01:23:43,910 --> 01:23:49,360
Most of the original vaccines because you're doing so much stuff to the virus, throwing formalin at it, you have it.

820
01:23:49,370 --> 01:23:55,400
In culture, most of the original vaccines targeted the F protein and it's post fusion conformation.

821
01:23:56,180 --> 01:24:01,160
So that's a little bit of locking the barn door after the horse ran away, right?

822
01:24:01,190 --> 01:24:05,780
Because that's after the virus has already begun the process of fusion into the cell.

823
01:24:05,790 --> 01:24:12,619
So it's less likely to be neutralizing because the virus just floating around has a prefusion conformation.

824
01:24:12,620 --> 01:24:17,210
So what you want, you want to hit that before it ever touches the cell, so that makes sense.

825
01:24:17,570 --> 01:24:24,020
So the M RNA vaccines, so a couple of things they developed chemically a strategy for stabilizing proteins,

826
01:24:24,020 --> 01:24:30,380
very unstable chemical strategy for stabilizing the F protein and its pre fusion conformation.

827
01:24:30,860 --> 01:24:37,280
So a lot of the recombinant protein vaccines are geared towards the stabilized prefusion conformation.

828
01:24:38,900 --> 01:24:44,870
And you're all using an RNA strategy to express the pre fusion protein on the cell surface.

829
01:24:45,230 --> 01:24:51,500
So now you're expressing this like an antigen presenting cell or something,

830
01:24:51,890 --> 01:24:59,810
and that's going to be the prefusion conformation and that's going to induce a neutralizing antibody response against that prefusion conformation.

831
01:25:00,500 --> 01:25:03,780
So better understanding of like how viruses get into the cell,

832
01:25:03,780 --> 01:25:10,280
a better ability to replicate the most effective form of the target antigen have all contributed

833
01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:15,980
that hopefully will be much more successful this go around at getting a vaccine for RSV.

834
01:25:16,670 --> 01:25:24,649
And that's going to be that's going to be to me very interesting just from like the regulatory and the sociology aspects of it.

835
01:25:24,650 --> 01:25:30,830
Just because RSV has such a dark, dark history in terms of vaccine development and it's a disease that affects children.

836
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:39,829
So but it's interesting to think about these things because you think about vaccines in terms of efficacy and like thinking

837
01:25:39,830 --> 01:25:45,830
about the development of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and how much resistance there is already out of fear for vaccination,

838
01:25:45,890 --> 01:25:52,340
like how terrible that would have been if they had the occurrence of antibodies, you know, enhanced disease.

839
01:25:52,340 --> 01:25:59,780
So it's really quite a risky area to work in, but obviously has great potential benefit.

840
01:26:01,010 --> 01:26:07,580
Okay. So that look at B, I did it. That was basically what I wanted to cover.

841
01:26:08,210 --> 01:26:12,390
So in terms of your reporting there, is there a little list of. What we have to do.

842
01:26:13,080 --> 01:26:15,420
The last you can look at most of this by yourself,

843
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:21,960
but the last part of this lecture is just reiterating this is kind of repeated from that early study reporting lecture,

844
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:28,110
reminding you what the reports have and reminding you for the introduction in particular.

845
01:26:28,530 --> 01:26:34,530
So we've talked about results in everything, the introduction that's setting the stage for the problem for the paper, right.

846
01:26:34,830 --> 01:26:38,040
So you're going to say RSV is a big important problem. Here is why.

847
01:26:38,790 --> 01:26:44,130
Then you're going to kind of get down to the nitty gritty of what your paper is going to be about in the context of RSV.

848
01:26:44,580 --> 01:26:47,670
So development of a vaccine for RSV would be great.

849
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:55,920
Yeah. So developing a vaccine would us we would be great. In order to do this, you have to use an effective animal model.

850
01:26:55,950 --> 01:27:02,660
Here's the animal model that we picked and then we were testing formalin inactivated, RSV, what is it?

851
01:27:02,670 --> 01:27:05,670
Formalin formula, inactivated alum adjuvanted RSV vaccine.

852
01:27:06,810 --> 01:27:10,469
So here's the sleight of hand because obviously you guys know this isn't going to work.

853
01:27:10,470 --> 01:27:16,770
And we have a lot of history to say that this isn't going to work. So this is where the reporting becomes a little artificial.

854
01:27:18,090 --> 01:27:22,889
So, you know, you can certainly explain that in your discussion.

855
01:27:22,890 --> 01:27:31,200
You can allude to that in your introduction and say, you know, in this study, we looked at such and such a vaccine in a cotton rat,

856
01:27:32,640 --> 01:27:37,980
and we were interested in whether there were adverse effects in the cotton rat and whether it would be effective.

857
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:41,099
You kind of know what's going to happen and then in your discussion,

858
01:27:41,100 --> 01:27:49,070
you can freely bring in all the literature that's happened since then about why this happened in the context of the cotton rat.

859
01:27:49,740 --> 01:27:52,900
So this is I mean, this is not a class. It's a defined model.

860
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:58,380
So this is a little bit fake in that we knew what was going to happen. But in the introduction, I would keep it pretty simple.

861
01:27:58,590 --> 01:28:02,480
RSV is a problem. Vaccines would be good. Here's a good animal model.

862
01:28:02,490 --> 01:28:05,850
We're going to test the vaccine. Does that make sense? So it's pretty short.

863
01:28:06,330 --> 01:28:11,220
And then the last part of is just saying we did an immunization in a cotton rain model.

864
01:28:11,310 --> 01:28:16,890
Just so I'm ready to get to the results. I know what's going to happen and I can just read the results.

865
01:28:17,640 --> 01:28:23,490
Okay, look, I made it unnecessarily complex, but I'm just going to skip over the results part.

866
01:28:23,490 --> 01:28:24,899
It's pretty self-explanatory.

867
01:28:24,900 --> 01:28:33,900
I gave you some little, like, bullet points of advice, and I'm going to give you feedback on those results in the discussion.

868
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:39,900
So I said it's important to have an objective, your ending your introductions section with.

869
01:28:39,900 --> 01:28:44,850
We did this to test efficacy and toxicity, so I know your objective results.

870
01:28:44,850 --> 01:28:48,750
I should have figured out in the discussion you're going to kind of address that objective, right?

871
01:28:49,110 --> 01:28:52,290
So make sure that you answer the question that was being asked.

872
01:28:52,590 --> 01:28:55,919
So go back to your study objectives. Did I answer whether was tolerable?

873
01:28:55,920 --> 01:29:00,000
Did I answer whether it was effective and justify your answers?

874
01:29:00,450 --> 01:29:07,260
So explain to me what evidence just reiterates. Summarize what supports whether it was well tolerated, what supports whether it was effective.

875
01:29:07,710 --> 01:29:15,330
So simple, clear rating. And like one of the things that can really help you, I think when you're writing science,

876
01:29:15,330 --> 01:29:22,600
we try to be like for science and sometimes you get too caught up in your words and it's less effective communication.

877
01:29:23,370 --> 01:29:32,640
So if you read the idea of like one topic sentence per paragraph and it's not a cliffhanger having the topic of the paragraph near the front,

878
01:29:33,300 --> 01:29:39,270
if you read your introduction and then you go through and read like the first couple of sentences of each paragraph in your results,

879
01:29:39,690 --> 01:29:45,960
you should have a pretty clear idea. You should kind of understand the flow of things, and then you can read your discussion.

880
01:29:46,080 --> 01:29:48,780
And that's sort of the highlights method of doing it.

881
01:29:49,710 --> 01:29:54,780
If it's unclear like what was happening in the results from doing that, you probably need to kind of condense,

882
01:29:54,780 --> 01:29:59,099
get rid of some words and be a little bit more direct in terms of one sentence, one paragraph.

883
01:29:59,100 --> 01:30:06,240
This is what happened. So clarity can really impact the effectiveness of your scientific paper.

884
01:30:07,110 --> 01:30:11,670
So summary paragraph are there any results that are in conflict with your conclusions?

885
01:30:13,990 --> 01:30:15,690
There's not much to say here.

886
01:30:15,700 --> 01:30:25,359
One thing that you could potentially talk about is like we had this effectiveness problem where it enhanced disease and you could say,

887
01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:30,580
well, there are many reasons for this. One might be antibody enhancement of infection.

888
01:30:31,630 --> 01:30:35,740
We didn't think this was the case there. Right, because we had our virus titer results.

889
01:30:35,740 --> 01:30:41,800
So you could pick something that's kind of a counter to your results or some other aspect that you want to address.

890
01:30:42,310 --> 01:30:46,640
That's kind of a different perspective. Wider implications.

891
01:30:46,650 --> 01:30:50,100
So in this case, you could talk about mechanisms.

892
01:30:50,110 --> 01:30:54,879
So this is again, kind of the why this is where you do need to have some literature support.

893
01:30:54,880 --> 01:31:01,750
Don't forget to reference, I have the instructions to authors for talks path for the format for references.

894
01:31:01,750 --> 01:31:05,350
Let me know if any questions and then kind of a speculum.

895
01:31:05,410 --> 01:31:09,250
So this is an academic paper, so you could put a speculative aspect in it.

896
01:31:09,250 --> 01:31:15,640
What would be the likely next step? So what might be something else we could do if there are unexpected findings and let you test those?

897
01:31:16,270 --> 01:31:21,720
Pick one thing that you want to have as a next step or that you would suggest or that you're interested in.

898
01:31:21,730 --> 01:31:24,760
Pick one thing and focus on that. It's not a review paper.

899
01:31:24,760 --> 01:31:29,620
You don't have to be completely comprehensive, but a general structure discussion is Here's what we found.

900
01:31:30,460 --> 01:31:34,840
Here are some things that we have to hedge our results with because we can't quite explain.

901
01:31:34,840 --> 01:31:36,850
So there's anything that's kind of counter to your argument.

902
01:31:36,850 --> 01:31:43,330
You put that in and then you put the bigger picture, the speculation, wider things we might do next, stuff like that.

903
01:31:45,010 --> 01:31:49,629
And then usually you want to end again with like a little bit of a summary based on this.

904
01:31:49,630 --> 01:31:52,870
Here's what happened here, what we think, does that make sense?

905
01:31:53,440 --> 01:31:58,629
Okay. So I find if you think of it that way, like it's very intimidating to write your intro.

906
01:31:58,630 --> 01:32:03,190
It's intimidating, right? Your discussion, because that's you're like, okay, here's the part where I just ramble on about stuff.

907
01:32:04,150 --> 01:32:10,299
But if you think of it with that structure, you're summarizing, you're putting in any caveats that the reader might be left with.

908
01:32:10,300 --> 01:32:14,140
Like you might think, Well, maybe they're thinking about this, you're addressing that caveat,

909
01:32:14,350 --> 01:32:21,309
and then you're setting it in a wider context by focusing on like one additional thing that could go farther and that can help you.

910
01:32:21,310 --> 01:32:26,670
Like if you just look at this, it has like a little bit of a structure for how many paragraphs or how many sections you want to have.

911
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:30,910
Okay? The references. The information is in there.

912
01:32:34,720 --> 01:32:40,640
Stay away as it all possible, not just here, but in regular writing and unpublished sources are used.

913
01:32:41,050 --> 01:32:48,240
People used to write with such a such personal communication that's much less acceptable except in unusual circumstances now.

914
01:32:48,250 --> 01:32:53,200
So you want to really try to reference and the context here, there's a citation.

915
01:32:54,220 --> 01:33:00,250
Don't just say Dr. Bergen's lecture slide 12, like use an actual citation.

916
01:33:00,610 --> 01:33:04,479
So all the stuff that I've given you is taken from somewhere as some basis.

917
01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:07,960
You know, you can look some stuff up yourself, you can use the references I've given you.

918
01:33:08,290 --> 01:33:12,339
If there's some random bit of fact from a lecture that you want to include, you don't know where I got.

919
01:33:12,340 --> 01:33:17,350
Let me know or if you can't find it yourself, but just use the citations appropriately.

920
01:33:18,640 --> 01:33:26,080
There's the formatting and that's it. And then again, the grading rubric, it's in there somewhere that can also help.

921
01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:29,820
Like when you're reading your paper, proofreading it to get it to turn it in.

922
01:33:29,830 --> 01:33:35,350
I just kind of look at this to give me a sense like, do I think any of these things are present?

923
01:33:35,350 --> 01:33:40,190
But that can give you an idea for the kind of things that I'm looking for. Something for us.

924
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:44,630
All right, good. Three, oh three. All right.

925
01:33:44,810 --> 01:33:48,140
And what have we covered? A lot of stuff today. We're broad ranging today.

926
01:33:48,680 --> 01:33:53,270
Any questions related to stuff that we discussed? The expectations.

927
01:33:54,680 --> 01:34:03,739
Right. Okay. So I will be out of town until coming back Wednesday, but not like back in the office until Thursday.

928
01:34:03,740 --> 01:34:09,620
I will still have emails. If you have questions, send them to me. I might be a little bit delayed being at the meeting, but I will get back to you.

929
01:34:10,310 --> 01:34:13,760
Yes. Just one question. It doesn't matter.

930
01:34:13,770 --> 01:34:19,339
We have those days because I was trying to do a full service and it's like way more than.

931
01:34:19,340 --> 01:34:26,370
Can you do it in one and a half? Yeah. Yeah. Because like, it's easier to read if it's not single spaced and it gives you a survivor.

932
01:34:26,390 --> 01:34:29,530
Right. To think that if you do one and a half, it's something like.

933
01:34:35,810 --> 01:34:40,280
Yeah. I mean, I wanted to be formatted in such a way that it's easy to read.

934
01:34:40,280 --> 01:34:46,849
It's not, like, very strange or impeding my ability to read it within reason.

935
01:34:46,850 --> 01:34:50,660
I'm not like trying to be like, your margins are one millimeter or less.

936
01:34:50,900 --> 01:34:54,379
Like I'm not going to try to grade you on that. Like, we're not going to publish this.

937
01:34:54,380 --> 01:34:57,170
It's not like a thesis manuscript.

938
01:34:57,380 --> 01:35:03,290
But the reason I gave some guidelines, you know, if you're writing a paper for a journal or something, that's going to answer the questions.

939
01:35:03,290 --> 01:35:12,140
And it also makes it easier, but it's not like a hard page, like, no, no, no, no, that it's not a hard page for that.

940
01:35:12,830 --> 01:35:14,330
But I am looking for clarity.

941
01:35:14,870 --> 01:35:25,549
So figure out if the reason you're going over is because you're giving necessary information to make sure you don't have extraneous words and simple,

942
01:35:25,550 --> 01:35:32,480
direct, declarative. Because if you have too many words, it does impact readability so that you might lose points.

943
01:35:32,480 --> 01:35:36,710
There's like an organization section on the rubric for like clarity of communication.

944
01:35:37,190 --> 01:35:41,989
So like for me, my first drafts are way longer than they need to be.

945
01:35:41,990 --> 01:35:46,069
And then I just have to go through and just slash out all the extra verbiage.

946
01:35:46,070 --> 01:35:48,770
Yeah. So I like transitions. All that is like, yeah,

947
01:35:48,770 --> 01:35:56,240
I mean you have some transitions but simple direct sentences so that it's very clear and there's a purpose to everything that you're writing.

948
01:35:56,600 --> 01:36:07,340
So you're not just rambling on. Yeah, that was like.

949
01:36:14,810 --> 01:36:18,960
Okay. All right. That sounds great.

950
01:36:21,450 --> 01:36:24,450
I saw that you did it.

951
01:36:24,900 --> 01:36:28,248
Yeah. Apparently they had. That's okay.
