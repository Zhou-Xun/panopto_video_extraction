1
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:25,200
have any questions left. you mean oh

2
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:30,360
good hello this is rebuilt in

3
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:38,840
supposed five four and so far we're doing. so five

4
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:44,900
seventy five percent of it is gonna be reached the stuff that

5
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:49,940
I I've especially and it's pretty straightforward so if you were

6
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:55,260
watching the video or ago um. can see so

7
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:00,640
for those five six of a double that so that that's each session that changes a lot

8
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,651
between other than the fact

9
00:01:05,651 --> 00:01:14,871
that I have like five five or both

10
00:01:14,871 --> 00:01:21,191
um before we do wanted to do. wanted to do a real diagnostic.

11
00:01:21,191 --> 00:01:27,111
before you can wrap up the evening allergy contact that we did to pay

12
00:01:27,111 --> 00:01:32,571
for tomorrow. this one of talking up a CD or and

13
00:01:32,571 --> 00:01:37,571
he's so I mean and there's one talking about being a

14
00:01:37,571 --> 00:01:43,411
body dependent enhancement enjoying a

15
00:01:43,411 --> 00:01:48,551
slash and said he didn't have a lot of antibody which is uh nothing

16
00:01:48,551 --> 00:01:54,331
about a good plot but if like that

17
00:01:54,331 --> 00:01:59,571
um unified to the block so if I could actually

18
00:01:59,571 --> 00:02:04,589
make these worse then if you had no unified when you

19
00:02:04,589 --> 00:02:09,869
vaccinate or even with conviction basically know you body levels have to hit to be

20
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:15,129
part of being high enough to completely block the fire 's gonna be doing intermediate job of locking the fire

21
00:02:15,129 --> 00:02:20,249
to actually paid talk about epidemiological he what is that

22
00:02:20,249 --> 00:02:26,109
look like in the population when you've got and about

23
00:02:26,109 --> 00:02:31,189
Jack. so it's been kind of a controversial idea it's been taken a while for people

24
00:02:31,189 --> 00:02:40,249
to mac and it's good to try to figure out what's happening. um

25
00:02:40,249 --> 00:02:45,569
dengue virus the kind of shows you what's happening with you nobody depended in here.

26
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:56,849
um do wanna walk you through this idea it's gonna can help clarify what they're talking

27
00:02:56,849 --> 00:03:02,629
the fires but after

28
00:03:02,629 --> 00:03:08,747
the cell entering the cell in the

29
00:03:08,747 --> 00:03:20,207
though and

30
00:03:20,207 --> 00:03:29,327
the bot

31
00:03:29,327 --> 00:03:36,567
so in the

32
00:03:36,567 --> 00:03:43,647
in about a this receptor.

33
00:03:43,647 --> 00:03:52,587
also an attachment

34
00:03:52,587 --> 00:04:02,967
home. is still

35
00:04:02,967 --> 00:04:20,515
the chip ended down.

36
00:04:20,515 --> 00:04:25,655
Herschel

37
00:04:25,655 --> 00:04:36,975
I like I still

38
00:04:36,975 --> 00:04:54,995
see that

39
00:04:54,995 --> 00:05:01,395
what he

40
00:05:01,395 --> 00:05:07,769
does that you know if he didn't receptor this

41
00:05:07,769 --> 00:05:14,089
this I'm super close to the cells and the holes that their come

42
00:05:14,089 --> 00:05:20,429
you on cell car you see know big

43
00:05:20,429 --> 00:05:25,529
super close to the well and it actually regulate the attachment and then

44
00:05:25,529 --> 00:05:31,069
function of it to happen. it's it's

45
00:05:31,069 --> 00:05:37,229
limited. it's close to to tell him which is bad.

46
00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:42,349
so this phone level and if worse than having

47
00:05:42,349 --> 00:05:49,589
no if I

48
00:05:49,589 --> 00:05:58,369
would keep busy entry function

49
00:05:58,369 --> 00:06:03,669
receptor the camp can actually increase CMC interactivity

50
00:06:03,669 --> 00:06:12,659
and give me questions about how the work.

51
00:06:12,659 --> 00:06:24,939
so we are a lot of

52
00:06:24,939 --> 00:06:30,679
fun maybe we go to each other's being in fact what

53
00:06:30,679 --> 00:06:36,299
we preach against them for an inspection with another and now it's we seen him please

54
00:06:36,299 --> 00:06:42,883
got traction with her problem. there's

55
00:06:42,883 --> 00:06:48,323
uh and and enhance it between five viruses so if you had dengue beef

56
00:06:48,323 --> 00:06:54,583
or infection is Iris worse for and so there's been study

57
00:06:54,583 --> 00:07:02,303
up in about body independent enhancements. we live versus you a similar but different.

58
00:07:02,303 --> 00:07:08,063
so um they said if she would didn't get back

59
00:07:08,063 --> 00:07:13,143
to the state fact that have been deployed um

60
00:07:13,143 --> 00:07:18,443
sounded some countries are being watched back in some countries they're being used in certain populations

61
00:07:18,443 --> 00:07:23,443
of speaker. if your first exposure to that doesn't create

62
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:28,483
a lot of again the buyer. when you actually have a breakthrough infection your infection could be worse and if you

63
00:07:28,483 --> 00:07:33,523
were not fax and they said to be very careful to use the dengue vaccine. so that

64
00:07:33,523 --> 00:07:38,683
you don't create the strep type of situate eagle have enough unified to crazy.

65
00:07:38,683 --> 00:07:44,096
uh and if I talk. that's it

66
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:49,336
Joel

67
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:55,156
so the pay for Wednesday

68
00:07:55,156 --> 00:08:01,096
's gonna talk about that. you have a

69
00:08:01,096 --> 00:08:06,436
paper here. thank Castle. like

70
00:08:06,436 --> 00:08:11,716
um and then it's measles mine did speak to talking about TV for

71
00:08:11,716 --> 00:08:16,796
TV functions and results. as

72
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:22,076
the just watch should be get back see they get sneeze

73
00:08:22,076 --> 00:08:27,076
anyways because you just get better and so we that used to be not have

74
00:08:27,076 --> 00:08:32,176
that big deal especially now that rear that you have to have

75
00:08:32,176 --> 00:08:37,416
devastating encephalitis for me. also you have long term immune suppression for me

76
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:43,076
the populations had very low vaccinations you see a very easy.

77
00:08:43,076 --> 00:08:48,390
raise all kinds of other diseases because his knees all had long term scrub

78
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:53,850
the press of the fact um there's a lot of mechanisms that are

79
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:59,290
in the list of hypotheses as to why that um one of them the mechanisms

80
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:04,930
they talk about. alright any questions before

81
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:15,861
any knowledge behind
