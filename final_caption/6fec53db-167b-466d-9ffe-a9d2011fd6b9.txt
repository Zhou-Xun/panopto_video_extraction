1
00:00:05,108 --> 00:00:09,173
Hi, I'm Jen Martin and
I am an adjunct clinical instructor in

2
00:00:09,173 --> 00:00:12,960
the Department of Health Management and
Policy.

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,870
I'm delighted to be speaking
with you today about

4
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:20,960
essential steps in effective
public health advocacy strategies.

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,910
So how did I get here
today in front of you?

6
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:28,860
I want to tell you my story because
I think it will shed some insight

7
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,700
on my background and

8
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:35,270
the skillset that I hope to impart to
you in this section of the module.

9
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:39,550
I graduated from the University
of Michigan in 1989,

10
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:43,190
I majored in Spanish and
political science here, and

11
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:48,700
moved out to Washington DC where I worked
on Capitol Hill and in the White House.

12
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,190
I got my law degree at Night, and

13
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:56,230
then I worked as a registered lobbyist
in a multi-practice law firm,

14
00:00:56,230 --> 00:01:02,690
where I represented a variety of clients
before the Congress and Administration.

15
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:07,708
I transferred home to Ann Arbor in
2002 where I served as the Director of

16
00:01:07,708 --> 00:01:12,902
Government Relations at the School
of Public Health until June of 2018.

17
00:01:12,902 --> 00:01:16,508
Then I made a transition
onto the faculty and

18
00:01:16,508 --> 00:01:21,379
I have a curriculum now where I
use all of the experiences and

19
00:01:21,379 --> 00:01:27,131
skills that I developed in those
various capacities over 30 years,

20
00:01:27,131 --> 00:01:31,160
and that is what I hope
to impart to you today.

21
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,820
So I tell you this because
I have been the lobbyist,

22
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:39,460
where I have been trying to advance
effective advocacy strategies.

23
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,380
And I have been the lobby-e,

24
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:47,610
I have been the person who a variety of
lobbyists and advocates were approaching.

25
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:52,420
I'm very excited to be talking with you
about public health advocacy strategies,

26
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:57,520
because I deeply and firmly believe
that this is a skillset about

27
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,510
professionalism that spans all
disciplines in public health.

28
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:06,360
And is so important as you
think about your careers and

29
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:13,170
how you will advance, what it is that you
care about in public health so deeply?

30
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:17,840
With that, I have a few preliminary
thoughts before we dive into the specific

31
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,370
steps in advocacy strategies.

32
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:26,760
First and foremost,
this is about relationships and

33
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:32,570
it is a combination of substance and
process.

34
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:37,340
The knowledge of the process of
effective advocacy is so important.

35
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:41,630
There are many, many substantive experts
in all disciplines and fields and

36
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:47,180
public health who are simply not trained
in how to effectively advance what

37
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:55,320
they know in issues that are so compelling
and so important to our public health.

38
00:02:55,320 --> 00:03:01,510
My second point is that this is really
about our fundamental democracy and

39
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:06,320
our ability to effectively
engage meaningful policy change.

40
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:11,510
So these things that I'm about
to share with you will span

41
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:16,100
multiple multiple organizations,
employment settings,

42
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:19,980
it spans the topics
ranging from epidemiology,

43
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:25,320
biostatistics, everything that we
do in the School of Public Health.

44
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:29,860
If you learn only one thing from me,
in this module,

45
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:33,920
it is about the importance
of relationships.

46
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:39,590
Please, please remember that, and
be gracious as you are advancing

47
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:46,250
your expertise in the policy setting,
first impressions deeply matter.

48
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:50,550
At this moment, it is so
important to stick to the substance and

49
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:58,520
not be distracted by overly emotional and
impassionate

50
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:02,850
strategies, sticking with
what we know to be true and

51
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:06,370
sticking with the process
will help us be successful.

52
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:10,690
There is an etiquette and protocol
here that I'll be mentioning over and

53
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:15,990
over as we move through these steps
that is critical to our success.

54
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:16,830
So with that,

55
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:23,370
we can dive into the specific steps
in any effective advocacy strategy.

56
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:27,920
One example that I'll be referring
to throughout this module

57
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:33,495
is a project that I worked on a few years
ago with our former dean, Ken Warner.

58
00:04:33,495 --> 00:04:38,335
When we as a disease community
were hoping to enact smoke free

59
00:04:38,335 --> 00:04:43,575
workplace legislation here in the State
of Michigan, we were very fortunate

60
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:48,915
to have a leader in our school
with expertise on this topic.

61
00:04:48,915 --> 00:04:53,040
So I'll be weaving that
substantive topic throughout

62
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,520
these steps as we move through these
steps in the next few minutes.

63
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,810
So the first step in any
effective advocacy strategy

64
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:06,120
is to identify the issue
that is passionate to you.

65
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:11,330
And what's really interesting about
the smoke fee workplace topic is that not

66
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:16,580
only did we have great,
robust capacity in our former dean and

67
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:19,640
his extensive research on this topic.

68
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:25,941
But we had many out of state students
who came to the school of public health,

69
00:05:25,941 --> 00:05:32,654
who were horrified that they were not able
to go out to dinner and be smoke-free.

70
00:05:32,654 --> 00:05:38,840
They were experiencing secondhand smoke,
and were shocked by it, here in Michigan.

71
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:43,240
So in both our student body and
on the faculty,

72
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,990
we had a very significant
body of knowledge.

73
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:55,380
So as an advocate, understanding
the problem and doing the research

74
00:05:55,380 --> 00:06:00,880
that enables you to serve as a resource
to policy makers is very important.

75
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,180
Because it's the foundation for
any effective advocacy strategy,

76
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,350
is that knowledge.

77
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:13,160
One of the nuances to effective
advocacy is also understanding

78
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:18,790
the opposition's point of view and
perspective and recognizing

79
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:24,660
that there will always be advocates
advancing the other side's arguments.

80
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:30,150
So for example, when we were working
on Smoke-free Workplace legislation,

81
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:34,190
the number one proponent of

82
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:38,630
the other side's argument was
the Michigan Restaurant Association.

83
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:43,900
And they were very concerned that if
this proposal were to move forward

84
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:47,240
that the public would simply
stop going out to dinner and

85
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,038
that it would affect their bottom line.

86
00:06:50,038 --> 00:06:55,010
So Dean Warner at the time
was able to weave in

87
00:06:55,010 --> 00:07:00,030
responses to those arguments in
his own pitch to the impact,

88
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:03,640
the health and
economic impact of this proposal.

89
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:09,740
So doing a deep dive on the literature
that you all are trained to do,

90
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:12,410
the comprehensive literature reviews.

91
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:17,040
And having a thorough understanding of
the issue will be the foundation for

92
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,230
any strategy.

93
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:25,090
From there, the second question to
ask yourself is, what is your goal?

94
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:29,470
What is it that you would like for
the policy maker to do?

95
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:33,890
Now that you have a robust
understanding of the problem,

96
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:37,560
what is the solution
that you want to advance?

97
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,570
And there are many things to
consider when developing and

98
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:44,130
crafting your advocacy goal.

99
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:48,450
The SMART goal is the specific,
measurable, assignable, realistic,

100
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:54,040
and time-related, which, to me,
really speaks to the idea that

101
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:59,290
there are many goals in health and
public health that sound like world peace.

102
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:04,360
Because they're so broad, you don't
really know when you've achieved them,

103
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,850
and no one will oppose them.

104
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:12,690
So I encourage all advocates
to think about tangible

105
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:18,480
outcomes that you want the policy
maker to do on your behalf.

106
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,270
So sometimes we have to be patient
in the world of public health and

107
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:26,120
think about short-term, intermediate,
and long-term outcomes.

108
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:31,360
And we also need to consider compromises
that might come up along the way.

109
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,620
Going back to Smoke-Free Workplace,
when we were thinking about that proposal

110
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:42,095
moving forward,
a coalition of policy makers from Detroit

111
00:08:42,095 --> 00:08:47,615
were very concerned about the impact
of the proposal on the casinos.

112
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:50,644
So they advanced in a coalition,

113
00:08:50,644 --> 00:08:56,061
a proposal that would exempt
casinos from this new policy.

114
00:08:56,061 --> 00:09:00,867
And the disease community was confronted
with the question of whether that

115
00:09:00,867 --> 00:09:04,527
was an acceptable compromise
that they could live with or

116
00:09:04,527 --> 00:09:08,740
whether they would walk away
from the proposal entirely.

117
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:16,420
So a lot of things go into this clarity
around the goal, the advocacy goal.

118
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:22,020
But once you have developed your goal,
you have that robust understanding,

119
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:26,140
you have a specific proposal
that you'd like to advance.

120
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:30,135
It is critically important
to know your audience and

121
00:09:30,135 --> 00:09:34,958
understand who can actually
advance your goal on your behalf.

122
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:39,576
And, unfortunately, advocates
spend a lot of time talking about

123
00:09:39,576 --> 00:09:44,570
their goal with people who aren't
able to help them execute it.

124
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:49,285
So being clear on who
the decision maker will be.

125
00:09:49,285 --> 00:09:53,223
Going back to Smoke-Free Workplace,
in that case,

126
00:09:53,223 --> 00:09:58,295
it was very clear that the legislature
would be the decision maker and

127
00:09:58,295 --> 00:10:03,894
that they would be the policy makers
that the community of disease groups and

128
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:06,870
others would be approaching.

129
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:13,460
So knowing who can actually advance
the goal is critically important.

130
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:18,900
And then thinking about
what do those people read?

131
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:22,290
How can we influence those people?

132
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:27,485
So Dr. Ken Warner,
our former dean was able to place

133
00:10:27,485 --> 00:10:33,745
op ed strategically timed before
key votes in news outlets that

134
00:10:33,745 --> 00:10:40,612
we knew would be accessed by critical
decision makers along the way.

135
00:10:40,612 --> 00:10:46,212
So these are the first three steps
in any effective advocacy strategy.
