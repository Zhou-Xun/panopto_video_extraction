1
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:13,350
It might be helpful for you to get started.

2
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:20,130
Who had a great weekend? Nice shirt week.

3
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:25,110
Yes. And looks like already have traveling.

4
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:40,920
Okay. So we are going to pick up where we left off with cardiovascular disease less than a week ago Monday.

5
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:50,879
And then the laser was in on Wednesday to talk about community based interventions to prevention of crises.

6
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:55,410
And so we're going to circle back to cardiovascular again.

7
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,050
This time we're going to be focusing on dietary sodium.

8
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:07,830
But before we get into that, just a reminder, no class on Wednesday when we get back from break.

9
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:22,920
Allison Forman, director of Ypsilanti Meals on Wheels, a really important program for homebound older adults, for seniors.

10
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:30,030
So she'll be here. I'm not sure if she's going to be in person or if it's going to be she'll be attending class via Zoom.

11
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:36,150
So I'm still waiting to hear back from her. But anyway, she will be presenting on Monday.

12
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:43,170
And then that Wednesday I'll be talking about traditional foods.

13
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:50,130
So and then the following week is student oral presentations.

14
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,790
So I've noticed I just want to look at the signup sheet.

15
00:01:53,790 --> 00:02:01,430
Only about half the class has signed up, so you need to sign up for either the fifth of the seventh, right?

16
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:10,230
So if you go to canvas and then select assignments, you will see an assignment called Oral Presentations,

17
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:19,350
has instructions for your oral presentations, and there's a link on that assignment page with the sign up sheet.

18
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:22,530
So be sure that you sign up.

19
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:36,600
So the fifth which is Monday, your advocacy one pager assignment is do and then obviously the last day a class is again just student presentation.

20
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:42,240
So that's what we have left in this course. This time is feels like November is just flow.

21
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:51,960
And one thing that I just wanted to touch base with you about this is a slide from November nine.

22
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:57,690
This was a the nutrition intervention presentation.

23
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:13,530
And at the end I highlighted a series of websites where you can go for class but also is professional to find evidence based intervention programs.

24
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:23,100
This is not you know, it's not an exhaustive series of slides with websites, but it's it's got some of the really key websites.

25
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:35,550
And one thing I just want to point out in this slide, I had highlighted list of stories and I'm going to ask were to caution don't go there.

26
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:41,700
It's it's great. It is stories about interventions, but it doesn't have the information that you need.

27
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:46,230
So instead you will want to use the topics.

28
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:50,520
If you haven't gotten into this website, you want to use the topics.

29
00:03:50,910 --> 00:04:03,550
And I'm just going to hop out for a minute. And this is the website, the Community Guide in Action.

30
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:08,410
And at the top is the tab for topics.

31
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,560
So again, ignore this list of stories. It doesn't have the information you need.

32
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:22,960
Select Topics. I'm going to search down to nutrition and there are a list of interventions.

33
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:34,540
I'm going to select one for adults. This is a work site nutrition and physical activity, work intervention.

34
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,970
So if you select that intervention,

35
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:46,719
what's nice about the community guide is that we can see already that this is an intervention that has is recommended,

36
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,640
that there's sufficient evidence that it's been shown to be effective.

37
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:56,230
So over here on the far left, we have recommended sufficient evidence.

38
00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:09,970
And if you go up to supporting materials and select that, you will find a review of the effectiveness as PDFs.

39
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:14,560
And you can look at all of the different interventions that they looked at.

40
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:19,960
And it's very nice. They have a bit on the far right column of those tables.

41
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:25,870
You can read the outcomes and some will say it wasn't shown to be effective.

42
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:29,740
Others will, you know, it's varying degrees of effectiveness.

43
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:42,310
So you can say if you select an intervention from the community guide in the section of your one page or where you have to talk about the evidence,

44
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:49,299
you can you can start by saying it is a recommended intervention by the community guide specifically,

45
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:53,920
not just the community guide, but again with the name you go back.

46
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:07,480
It's the task force. That's a long name. Oh, yeah.

47
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:14,350
It's the Community Preventative Services Task Force recommends this intervention.

48
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:23,950
And then you would cite this website, and some students may even get into the supporting review document and take a look.

49
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:30,070
You know, maybe over half of the interventions were found to be effective, and you could have a little bullet that highlights that.

50
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:34,060
So you can add more information off of that supporting document.

51
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:44,319
But my point here is that this is an example where this task force goes through and evaluates interventions.

52
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:53,380
And then based on that evaluation, comprehensive review and have it posted, it is considered that it's recommended.

53
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:59,230
So I just wanted to clarify the use of the community guide.

54
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,070
Any questions that you can find.

55
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:36,670
And one other point that I want to while we're talking about your one pager, is that when you're trying to find an intervention, the what?

56
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,480
Advocacy, advocacy, one pager assignment instructions say, you know,

57
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:48,340
you find an intervention that addresses one of the priorities that you were identified from your needs assessment.

58
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:55,540
I know some of you have very specific priorities that kind of fell out of the information, the data that you collected.

59
00:07:55,540 --> 00:08:01,540
And you might not be able to find an intervention that specifically addresses one of those priorities.

60
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:05,980
You guys don't have a whole heck of a lot of time to find an intervention.

61
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:11,080
So if you can find an intervention that addresses one of your priorities,

62
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:18,940
find an intervention that addresses your nutrition or health concern you're topic.

63
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:26,440
So if your topic was food insecurity, at the very minimum, find an intervention that addresses food insecurity.

64
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,680
Okay. So the first step really is to address one of your priorities.

65
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:36,730
But again, if you have very specific priorities and you're having a hard time finding an intervention that would address one of those,

66
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:44,350
then just find an intervention that addresses your nutrition topic or your health topic because again,

67
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:50,590
you don't want to spend two and a half, three weeks finding the intervention and give yourself only three days to develop

68
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:54,490
your advocacy document because that's what you're actually getting graded on.

69
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:59,229
So the intervention does not have to be perfect.

70
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:05,300
You don't have a lot of time, right? You just need to find something that's kind of like.

71
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:12,399
But one of my questions was like, you take, say one of these things like Community Guide and it has your evidence based and all your really

72
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:19,900
all we're really doing is taking that and taking that information and making it look nice.

73
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:20,740
With advocacy.

74
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:28,629
I'm like, obviously there's more that goes into it, but it's not like we have to do any type of data analysis for a different population.

75
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:31,990
Like we're just taking what we find. You are share, you are sharing.

76
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:35,770
Where was this intervention perhaps implemented?

77
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:40,230
What are the interventions strategies? Right.

78
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:52,620
What was done in the intervention? So you're just characterizing, describing, explaining the intervention because you want to recommend it, right?

79
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:59,410
Yeah, that makes sense for everybody.

80
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:13,690
Okay. So this is the last slide we finished up on a week ago Monday.

81
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:18,010
So we were talking about we had shifted from cardiovascular disease,

82
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:25,959
the prevalence of it to hypertension because hypertension actually is a major risk factor for cardiovascular.

83
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:32,080
And there was a slide that if you just look at individuals, if you remove the hypertension,

84
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:39,910
the actual prevalence of cardiovascular disease drops a lot because hypertension is such a major component.

85
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:51,430
These are the non-pharmacological interventions for hypertension that's recommended and this is based on the report.

86
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:59,080
We covered it in Monday, but we have a new guidelines as of 2017 for how we.

87
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,240
Diagnose hypertension as well as how we treat.

88
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:12,680
So you can see that there are a lot of the recommendations are lifestyle factors.

89
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:16,419
Right? Diets at the top? Well, not at the top, but I mean,

90
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:24,909
it's a prominent intervention and it's one of the first interventions that they'll go to before they even discuss medication,

91
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:27,490
unless somebody has really severe hypertension.

92
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:37,120
And I really like this table because this highlights all of the different interventions, strategies here.

93
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:43,660
These are all lifestyle strategies on the left and on the right.

94
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:54,640
It's the reduction in blood pressure per interrupt, you know, per well intervention.

95
00:11:55,450 --> 00:12:03,820
And you can see that healthy diet among people who are diagnosed as hypertensive.

96
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:16,370
We see a dramatic drop in their systolic blood pressure, 11 millimeters the mercury compared to well,

97
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:22,330
even among people who have normal that are normotensive. We see a pretty significant drop.

98
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:26,170
I suggest diet is known to improve.

99
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:37,569
The other one that we're going to focus on. So obviously, physical activity contributes to a decline in systolic blood pressure,

100
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:41,290
both among those that are hypertensive and those that are normotensive.

101
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:57,700
But dietary sodium dietary sodium is a key factor because we know that high sodium diets are risk factors and contribute to hypertension.

102
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:06,040
That's in itself. So we're going to spend a little bit of time talking about dietary sodium.

103
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:12,159
Okay. So this is the mean sodium intake among individuals.

104
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,370
This is from enhanced greater than one year of age.

105
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:21,340
And to be honest, our intakes of sodium really haven't shifted a lot.

106
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:31,809
Maybe a little, but not a lot. And so you can see I've highlighted among males 19 years and older,

107
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:40,090
the average intake is the mean intake is roughly 4000 milligrams of sodium per day in the diet.

108
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:48,890
And women are females. In 19 years of age, it's almost 3000 milligrams.

109
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:55,820
So what is the recommended intake level in the U.S.?

110
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:03,380
2300 milligrams. Over on the far right.

111
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:13,459
This is just circling back to our dietary reference intake lecture way back in October,

112
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:20,660
early October, late September, tried disease risk reduction, intake level, the KDR.

113
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:31,910
That level was set at 2300 milligrams. And so you can see here in this far right column in the box that I've highlighted,

114
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:41,570
the row that I've highlighted, 97% of men 19 years and older exceed the KDR for sodium.

115
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:56,360
So and again, you just look at the percentages that exceed it's high and widespread across the population, across age groups.

116
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:04,190
So we know that's an issue and it's been persistent despite efforts to reduce sodium.

117
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:11,720
Where do you think the sodium is coming from in our diets, just in terms of foods, per se?

118
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:18,589
Yeah, that's right. Okay. So but when we talk about process mean, give me some examples of what you think.

119
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:24,560
If we're let's consider what might be the top ten foods that are contributing to sodium in the US diet.

120
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:29,150
Snack foods and meats. Okay. So meats.

121
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:32,600
Specifically processed meats, right? Like deli meats and stuff.

122
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:37,160
Snack foods. Right. Salty snacks. What else?

123
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:41,900
Soups? Yep. Canned soups. What else?

124
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:48,200
You guys are doing great. We've got three out of the ten. Just adding extra salt in general.

125
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,800
A lot of people salt our foods. They do.

126
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:59,360
But we're going to circle back to that. That's actually not part of the that's not one of the components of the top ten contributors.

127
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:06,800
But, yes, you're right. That's a contribution. Listen. Are there like dairy products, like cheese that maybe get products?

128
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,430
Yes. I can't remember. I think cheese made the top ten.

129
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:14,690
Yeah. Yeah. You know, pre-prepared frozen foods.

130
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:21,090
So. Yes. And that's sort of a really big umbrella for so probably, you know,

131
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:26,270
I can't remember now specifically, but there's prepared foods that are especially high.

132
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:29,550
Yeah. Any other food groups?

133
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:33,680
Yeah. This is like a like a beverage thought, but just those who are, like, drinking,

134
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:38,570
like Gatorade and stuff, you don't necessarily need those, like, electrolyte back.

135
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:46,999
Yeah, I'm not sure it didn't make the top ten, but it's, you know, I don't know where in the list it would,

136
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:53,190
but that's certainly in especially some people drink a lot of that can be some canned vegetables for high sodium.

137
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:59,910
I don't remember seeing those if they're in the list, but they do contribute to sodium.

138
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:03,340
Yeah. Pickles. Pickles would.

139
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:10,940
Yes. Yeah. Yeah. So one that we don't always think about and is bread.

140
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:18,140
And actually bread is one of the top contributors because you need sodium for bread making.

141
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:21,190
You have to have salt for bread to rise.

142
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:30,530
And in fact, some countries bread is one of the worst offenders, like the sodium content in some countries is really, really high.

143
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:35,870
So bread is actually or yeasted products is probably a better way to say it.

144
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:44,140
So we're going to get back to that list. So this is the sources of sodium in the US diet.

145
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:49,940
This is from 2020. The 2022 one looked almost identical, so I didn't bother updating it.

146
00:17:50,210 --> 00:18:00,320
But what we have here on in this bottom legend are the sources of sodium in our diet and it's in order based on the color.

147
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:06,110
So the very bottom color is blue. That's salt or sodium added outside of the home.

148
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:19,460
Then it's rust colored, which is inherent sodium that's just inherent to food added in home preparation, which Hayley was talking about is the green.

149
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:24,709
Then there's a purple which is added at the table and then we can't even see,

150
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:35,570
but there's a light blue home tap water and then dairy or dietary supplements and nonprescription and acids, very there's a tiny sliver of orange.

151
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:41,930
So and then we have it by race, ethnicity.

152
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:49,150
So what is the major contributor? It contributes 70% of sodium in our diet.

153
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,040
What is the major contributor of sodium in our diets?

154
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:57,330
Is that restaurant food they say added outside the home? It's added outside the home.

155
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:02,670
That includes foods that have been manufactured as well as restaurant fast foods.

156
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:08,580
Yep. Yep. So that's where we get the bulk of our sodium.

157
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:15,510
Now, that's, you know, we still get some sodium in food preparation, as well as what we add at the table.

158
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:22,930
But by far, where we're getting the over 70% is from outside the house.

159
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:37,360
And these are the top ten. So I'm assuming pizza, the cheese component.

160
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:45,790
Yes, because cheese is number nine pizzas.

161
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:49,000
All of it is the bread. Yeah, it is. Yep.

162
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:52,600
And it's the cheese. So that's pizzas right up there.

163
00:19:56,290 --> 00:20:03,100
The thing that's so interesting about the burritos and tacos that and I've seen other lists and they still show up,

164
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:08,770
you know, they may shift around, but they're they all seem to show up in this top ten category.

165
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:12,429
So if you just consider the top ten foods.

166
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:17,770
Now, this was based on NHANES, which is a national sample.

167
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:28,810
If you take into account the top ten foods that contribute, these contribute 45% of sodium in an individual's diet.

168
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:32,290
That's not to say that they're consuming all those foods in a given day,

169
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:40,959
but it's much question the chicken is chicken on there because of the way it's processed like fried

170
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:46,790
chicken or because the way manufacturers tend to inject them with sodium solutions to keep them juicy.

171
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:52,900
So I think it's the injected ones. So I was thinking about like rotisserie chicken you can buy at the grocery store.

172
00:20:52,960 --> 00:21:05,220
Most of those are injected. And I think that when you buy a whole chicken, you can I mean, there are some manufacturers that inject with sodium a lot.

173
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:11,050
If you look at the packaging, you know, boneless, skinless, fresh, they'll say may contain up to 10%.

174
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:21,219
Yeah. So it's the it's the added Bryant, you know, salty broth that's added to keep chicken juicy, but it's a source of sodium.

175
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:25,270
So anybody's surprised with what's on the list.

176
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:40,600
And for me, I think eggs. Yeah. So I'm wondering if some of that is eggs and omelets that somehow are free.

177
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:44,680
Never said. Yeah, I'm thinking, wow, I don't know.

178
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:50,680
I hope I never add salt my eggs. But you know, maybe I mean, we're at a point, it's hard to know.

179
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,979
But when I saw that, I was a little taken aback by the eggs anomalies.

180
00:21:53,980 --> 00:22:05,230
And all I could think of is maybe this is actually I'm wondering if this is coming from no, I can't be restaurant food.

181
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:12,700
So they must be packaged like you can buy eggs by being containers.

182
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:16,180
You know, you just like the egg whites number like four.

183
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:23,050
But you can also buy eggs that you they're just like in self self-serve.

184
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:27,640
We're trying to say they're in single serve containers that you put in the microwave.

185
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:34,270
That's all I can think of. Jimmy Dean makes them like with sausage and egg and yeah, that's all I could think of.

186
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:39,430
I'm not sure about the online, so my comment is ketchup.

187
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:41,530
Most ketchup has a lot of sodium.

188
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:50,020
My guess is just that it's not consumed in such a quantity that it would be interesting to know where condiments fall on this list.

189
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:55,790
Okay. Thank you.

190
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:01,330
So we have heard of the dash diet. Oh, good.

191
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:06,990
How many worked with the dash diet? Yeah, he's right.

192
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:12,450
Yep. Anybody else on the West Dash diet? Okay.

193
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:24,030
So the Dash diet was developed by NIH in the 1990s, mid 1990s.

194
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:32,070
It was actually developed to examine the role of diet on hypertension.

195
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:37,050
Could improvement in diet improve hypertension?

196
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:48,870
And so NIH has a whole website about the Dash diet and Dash two stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension.

197
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:55,770
And it's actually very similar to what we think about when we think about the Mediterranean diet.

198
00:23:55,950 --> 00:24:03,000
So it promotes fish and nuts and healthy oils and whole grains and fruits and vegetables and so forth.

199
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:16,710
So if you go on their website, they have these nice graphics of eat these foods and beans and so forth, but limit the intake of these other foods.

200
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:25,830
So the important issue with or an important factors with the dash diet is, one, it limits sodium intake,

201
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:35,910
either 2300 milligrams or for folks that need to reduce their sodium intake even further down to 1500 milligrams.

202
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:43,830
It emphasizes high potassium foods, high potassium containing foods.

203
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:47,640
So what are high potassium containing foods?

204
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:52,200
Those bananas, potato potatoes.

205
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:56,070
The maligned white potato actually is really, I assume.

206
00:24:56,490 --> 00:25:00,630
Yeah. What else you use?

207
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:12,600
Really. All of the healthy fruits and vegetables are high and in fact, diet here are urinary.

208
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:26,400
Potassium can be used as a biomarker to assess sort of diet quality of individuals because potassium is really just found in those healthy foods.

209
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:34,380
So dash diet again is a focus on fruits, vegetables, low fat, dairy and nuts and seeds and so forth.

210
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:40,559
What's nice about this, for those of you that may end up working,

211
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:46,350
if you end up working in cardiology or you have to work with clients or patients that are.

212
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:56,810
Prescribed a dash diet or they need to be on a specific diet because of certain risk factors.

213
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:07,010
They have this resource. So for specific caloric intake levels, depending on what your client or patient is consuming from calories,

214
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:14,680
they have this dash diet broken down based on servings, which is really nice, right?

215
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:27,290
So depending on whatever caloric intake a person requires, it has this various servings or a numbers of servings of various food groups.

216
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:32,360
So it's very helpful for dietary counseling, diet planning.

217
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:42,820
I'd like you to take just 5 minutes, talk to a neighbor. Can do it by yourself.

218
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:46,890
But just consider this. A lot of information on the dash diet.

219
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:54,030
A lot that we would want to convey to a client or patient.

220
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,700
But if you were in a community setting,

221
00:26:57,390 --> 00:27:07,260
let's let's say you were invited into a workplace or a worksite where they're promoting chronic disease risk reduction.

222
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:14,549
And they've asked you to come in and talk about how do you reduce your risk of cardiovascular

223
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:20,100
disease and you decide that you want to highlight the dash diet next 5 minutes.

224
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:26,520
What factors would you want to highlight in your educational piece?

225
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:37,460
Remembering that we can't cover everything because remember, as adults or just as human beings, our eyes glaze over, right?

226
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:48,750
We get too much information. So just thinking about how might you educate a group at the community level on the Dash diet?

227
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:56,730
So take 5 minutes, talk it out, and then we'll kind of reconvene. What would be the key points that you would want to highlight?

228
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:28,110
So I would say to just before you go, yeah, you know, just like to think, well, I'll be happy to come and say, yeah, yeah, just do the thing that.

229
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:44,880
And it's also going to point out that we have I mean, I would say let me ask you more about her her to live,

230
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:57,090
because I often think that this is a time that everybody's got something once a week, maybe two or 3 minutes.

231
00:28:57,130 --> 00:29:04,980
You feel like I think a lot of friends and yes.

232
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:08,579
Of like something like this, you know.

233
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:24,900
So like if I have a chance or we spend time with you, you must speak out and actually go to the bench.

234
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:35,920
But like I said, how do you like these things?

235
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:45,900
So I can explain to you how, you know, eliminating one intake is the diet.

236
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:54,460
Yeah. And if you said I've read to so much that people are talking about like.

237
00:29:55,350 --> 00:30:09,300
Yeah, like you're like, oh well it's my job to do something like, oh, okay, well, what would you say?

238
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:14,030
Oh, that's very cheap.

239
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:31,500
So, like sex and violence against your life.

240
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:40,890
Since I was young, I.

241
00:30:45,290 --> 00:31:08,470
Yeah, just felt like, you know, who doesn't want to be like, oh, honey, you already have one of these six.

242
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:21,240
And she was saying, you know, I don't know how I saw in.

243
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:37,520
Oh, really? That's funny. Yeah, because I guess it works the way that I would just be in this question about, you know, when they go, it's okay.

244
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:42,210
But let's see.

245
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:58,760
So what did folks back to around the room? And so we focus more on what to increase as opposed to what to increase.

246
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:05,640
So specifically, like fruit and vegetable consumption and lean meats as opposed to process.

247
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:14,410
And then I thought that a lot of people want a mediterranean diet, but they don't necessarily know what the dash diet is.

248
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:18,889
So if you even just briefly mentioned that it's similar to the Mediterranean diet,

249
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:25,440
that might give them a framework of what types of foods to be consumed more than others and.

250
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,420
I'm Jennifer Knight.

251
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:39,110
And we talked a little bit about like swapping this for that instead of, you know,

252
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:44,960
kind of like your sense of like focus on just cutting things out because I think that, you know, just as they reduce sodium intake.

253
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:51,350
Right. But, you know, making suggestions for, you know, saving more fruits and vegetables,

254
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:56,179
but then also saying maybe instead of having red meat, swap it for chicken and that kind of thing.

255
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:59,360
Just or like instead of cooking with butter with olive oil,

256
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:13,040
just kind of those concrete substitutions that people can do that kind of side a void using the words like potassium and sodium,

257
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,199
honestly, because it can confuse people.

258
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:20,689
And then also, if they're reading the nutrition label, they just see sodium and they're just avoiding everything.

259
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:26,149
And so instead of saying like, oh, like limit your salt intake and add more fruits and vegetables,

260
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:34,520
or even focus on like different types of fruits, vegetables you can do the frozen, what's in season, all those accessibility things.

261
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:43,850
And then in terms of a work place, again adding more like fruit vending machines and options like that, that it's more easily accessible for them.

262
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:56,569
Yeah, actually raises a good point that sometimes if you just talk about low sodium, you know, the actors go up, you know, the name of sodium.

263
00:33:56,570 --> 00:34:00,379
So yeah. Yeah. Not even talking about specifically sodium ingestion.

264
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:03,890
Yeah. But do you guys have anything?

265
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:07,730
Sabrina Pretty much the same.

266
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:15,200
All of you are. Yeah, know. Sorry. I just told you I saw you making the ad.

267
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:20,510
Kind of said a lot of alternatives. Having alternatives.

268
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:29,390
Options that we can suggest for the community we have to talk about, like going outside and going to different restaurants outside.

269
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:39,710
Talk about the sodium content. That's like emphasizing urinary sodium, like maybe more spices in your food.

270
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:44,060
Can you use different spices? You don't need to add as much salt.

271
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:49,460
So like recipe, like, oh, let's reduce sodium by having these kinds of spices in there.

272
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:53,580
Yeah, yeah.

273
00:34:53,720 --> 00:35:02,510
It's that's an important point actually to highlight because people don't realize that we can actually adjust in a fairly short period of time.

274
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:10,220
We can go from high sodium consumers, and if we slowly dial our sodium back, we can make those adjustments.

275
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:12,470
We do adapt.

276
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:24,500
So there's actually, you know, some nice alternative herbal blends that don't have any sodium that folks can use about the middle section.

277
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:32,390
Anybody have any points to add? We didn't focus on that since she's taking allergies into consideration.

278
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:41,000
So that's pretty much what everybody else said. We were just too much salt intake and decreased fatty meats and we said we can even say fatty meats.

279
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,030
We said red meat specifically because people identify with color.

280
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:48,530
Maybe not so much fat content. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

281
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:56,740
And you can talk about nuts and seeds with the caveat that obviously those who have no food allergies to nuts and seeds, you know.

282
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:07,240
Doesn't apply, unfortunately. Any other we would talk about.

283
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:11,979
Instead of emphasizing on lowering the sodium intake,

284
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:17,080
we would rather emphasize on increasing the intake of vegetables and fruits because we think

285
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:22,990
that maybe some vegetables and fruits are high in potassium and potassium antagonists.

286
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:26,980
So yeah. Yeah.

287
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:34,100
And you know, as other groups have said, it's not even so much a discussion of sodium, potassium,

288
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:43,850
but by emphasizing more fruits and vegetables, you are reducing potentially reducing sodium, but definitely increasing potassium.

289
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:50,840
Any other thoughts or any other points that were discussed?

290
00:36:51,500 --> 00:37:01,460
Yeah, I think that the educational seminar and they will provide a lot of bread and pieces that provide these kind of food,

291
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:14,180
but they come through a lot of vegetables and so they can convey information that is not healthy food and.

292
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:24,560
Do you have anything? So I was looking at marketing.

293
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:30,380
Well, it's information versus the marketing side of it. People get really overwhelmed when you start with the numbers and the technical terms.

294
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:37,490
It sounds like in chemistry class. Yeah. So just saying really simple messaging.

295
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:40,850
Skip the salt shaker. Avoid desserts and sugary beverages.

296
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:45,860
Try low fat dairy. Eat more efficient poultry. Enjoy a range of fruits and vegetables.

297
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:49,980
To kind of meet people where they're at. Just give them simple things.

298
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:54,890
Start with them and become more curious and more interested, like melting.

299
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,850
My kids are able to introduce themselves.

300
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:14,330
And the other component to this is, you know, if you're working with low income or you, you know, any group that you're working with, you have.

301
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:23,239
It's important to be prepared with resources for folks that are concerned about, you know, well, I can't buy fish.

302
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:26,120
Fish is expensive. So what would be an alternative?

303
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:37,909
Well, you know, maybe only buying fish when it's on sale or the canned salmon is a great option, except that they add salt oftentimes.

304
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:43,940
So that can be problematic. Maybe tuna fish if it's not, especially if tuna is on sale.

305
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:51,050
And that can be problematic, too, because of sodium unless they have a low sodium option.

306
00:38:51,350 --> 00:39:00,350
So it's important to have in your pocket some resources for those who can't just go out and purchase smoothies.

307
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:02,540
And nuts are not cheap either.

308
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:13,100
So coming up with ideas of how to increase nuts and seeds in their diet, but do it in a way that's budget friendly, is positive.

309
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:17,570
And I was just thinking also like, quote, cultural perspective.

310
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:24,409
Like, I'm, you know, in my culture, I'm used to different beans and legumes, but not everybody is.

311
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:28,490
And I've had friends like, oh, I never these like, how do you eat that?

312
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:36,549
Oh, really? So, like, knowing, like who you're talking to then, like what you're saying, like, oh, this is a way you can eat this.

313
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:42,920
This goes with this kind of food that's important budget. Assuming, like everyone knows how to eat that food.

314
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:48,530
Yeah, yeah. You need to know your your community members.

315
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:53,390
Right. And who is going to be there and make yourself so good.

316
00:39:56,420 --> 00:40:02,570
Any other thoughts about the dash diet or any observations or anything?

317
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:10,470
All right. So I just wanted to show you results from a couple of studies.

318
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:18,500
These are again, these are older but seminal studies that are worth revisiting.

319
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:27,200
So this was a study that was conducted by a group, a group of epidemiologists and doctors and so forth.

320
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:38,630
They believe this came out of Harvard or that sort of research group where they wanted to look at the impact of the dash diet.

321
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:47,179
Both. Usual U.S. diet versus dash diet on blood pressure.

322
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:50,030
Specifically, this is systolic.

323
00:40:50,630 --> 00:41:05,420
So this was a randomized controlled trial and had two arms control arm and the intervention arm, which is the dash diet for both arms.

324
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:10,280
Dash and control participants.

325
00:41:11,450 --> 00:41:21,380
When they were consuming their diet, they went through three intervals, 330 day intervals in which the diet had different levels of sodium.

326
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:32,810
Okay. So both arms of the randomized controlled trial, the dash diet and the control diet, and again, in control diet is just the classic U.S. diet.

327
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:44,420
There were three different levels of sodium. So participants in the control diet would just be randomly assigned to one of the sodium levels.

328
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:50,809
But by the time they were done, they went through all three, 30 days at each sodium level.

329
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:53,960
And at the end of those 30 days. They took their blood pressure.

330
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:59,210
Likewise with the dash diet. There were three different sodium levels.

331
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:07,340
And at the end of those 30 days, the following one level took the blood pressure and then the participant was started on the next level,

332
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:16,220
whatever level it was random breath. So on the Y axis here, we have systolic blood pressure units, millimeters of mercury.

333
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:19,610
On the x axis, we have the sodium levels.

334
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:26,840
So there's high, intermediate and lower. And over here, we have what that translates to.

335
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:40,160
The change. The numbers reflect changes in systolic blood pressure going from one sodium diet to the next.

336
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:50,220
As well as looking at the difference between blood pressure when we compare controls to the Dash diet.

337
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:56,010
So take a couple of minutes to look at that.

338
00:42:56,580 --> 00:43:08,340
And then I want to. What observations or what conclusions, what results, what points would you want to highlight from this figure?

339
00:43:13,610 --> 00:43:19,850
Sodium is directly related to blood pressure. Sodium is directly related to blood pressure.

340
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:24,560
Right. So that's a good overarching point.

341
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:30,830
What else can be? How would you. What interpretations would you want to highlight?

342
00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:38,809
Yep. I would also say that you see pretty much immediate effects too, especially on these 30 day implements.

343
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:48,110
It makes a big difference. So like the sooner you can start on the lower like it's going to not just be a lifelong thing.

344
00:43:48,110 --> 00:43:52,610
Like you can't have that change. That's a good point. Yeah. 30 days is not that long.

345
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:55,890
And within 30 days they see. Yeah. Jim.

346
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:56,080
Huh?

347
00:43:56,540 --> 00:44:07,520
I'm not sure if I'm interpreting this correctly, but it seems like the dash diet and equals sodium intake seems to have lower systolic blood pressure.

348
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,340
But I don't know if I'm reading the chart correctly.

349
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:24,290
So the point you're highlighting is there is a difference between a classic or a Western you at the usual U.S. diet versus the dash diet.

350
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:35,510
Those are just going from the controlled diet down to the dash diet results in lowering of blood pressure, irrespective of the sodium level.

351
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:47,750
So even the high sodium, which is 3.5 grams, we see almost a six millimeter difference going from the control diet down to the dash diet.

352
00:44:49,790 --> 00:45:00,230
So even if a person is, well, you know, we want you to consume the dash diet, but they don't necessarily start right away with lowering their sodium.

353
00:45:00,590 --> 00:45:07,010
There's still going to be improvement in their blood pressure just going from a U.S. diet, usual U.S. diet to dash.

354
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:10,790
I think that's the point you were highlighting, John.

355
00:45:10,790 --> 00:45:19,010
How is that just going from usual diet to dash irrespective of sodium, improves, systolic blood pressure.

356
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:28,490
But then you layer on the different levels of sodium and we see, again, even more improvement.

357
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:37,820
Right. Using some tweak. The biggest drop regardless of sodium intake, is moving to a less inflammatory diet.

358
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:40,500
Yeah, you're losing almost six systolic.

359
00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:48,620
Yeah, it's just going to outclass inflammatory diet where you're only losing, like one and a half points on the salt on the lower right.

360
00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:52,610
But you also have to remember what else is in the dash diet. Higher potassium.

361
00:45:52,610 --> 00:46:02,800
Higher potassium. Yeah. So potassium has a key role with kidney in terms of fluid balance and so forth.

362
00:46:02,810 --> 00:46:07,610
I mean, you know, the physiologies beyond what I would want to get into talking about.

363
00:46:07,610 --> 00:46:14,549
But we know that potassium and sodium have very opposing effects on the kidney and all

364
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:20,180
of the regulatory mechanisms that regulate how much fluid is on board and so forth.

365
00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:30,050
So, yes, your point is well taken, but it's important to remember potassium is, you know, certainly one of the key factors in this.

366
00:46:32,810 --> 00:46:37,520
Any other point? I mean, any other important points from this?

367
00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:46,459
Yeah, I have a question. In general, are people consuming way less potassium on the standard American diet?

368
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:50,150
Is that another factor? Yes, we do not have.

369
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:57,500
Well, let me flip this around. We know the foods that are high in potassium.

370
00:46:57,710 --> 00:47:04,070
We know that the US struggles in consuming adequate servings of fruits and vegetables.

371
00:47:04,070 --> 00:47:13,100
Right. You guys, many of you looked at that and Heinz data for your nutrition section five fruits and vegetables a day.

372
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:16,680
The percentage of people that achieve that is low, right?

373
00:47:16,970 --> 00:47:21,170
So potassium intake in this country needs considerable improvement.

374
00:47:22,190 --> 00:47:26,360
And that's one of the one reason why it's now on food labels.

375
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:30,050
Just one reason. It's an area that we need to improve. Yeah.

376
00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:37,670
Anything else? I think that pretty much highlighted the key findings.

377
00:47:38,450 --> 00:47:45,710
But I love the study because it's just there's so many important points that come from this results.

378
00:47:46,490 --> 00:47:57,470
And this is actually this figure is often you see it in a lot of various publications when it comes to sodium diet and cardiovascular disease.

379
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:12,260
This is the Oncor study. This was a randomized controlled trial of men and women who had hypertension.

380
00:48:13,370 --> 00:48:16,880
Their systolic blood pressure had to be at least above 130.

381
00:48:17,390 --> 00:48:25,790
Think the diastolic had to be above 185. These are individuals who had a BMI that was greater than 25.

382
00:48:27,890 --> 00:48:33,620
It's a three arm randomized controlled trial. The three arms are over here.

383
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:40,460
So it was one arm is the dash diet with weight maintenance, weight management.

384
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:51,110
So it included the dash diet plus physical activity as well as some cognitive behavioral counseling.

385
00:48:52,710 --> 00:48:57,170
B The second arm is the dash diet only.

386
00:48:57,350 --> 00:49:06,340
And for these participants that were randomized to that arm, there was no way they did not want them exercising and they had to stay weight stable.

387
00:49:06,350 --> 00:49:12,050
So they were their weight was collected every week and their calories were adjusted to keep them weight stable.

388
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:19,760
So that was dash diet alone. And then the C is usual intake, usual U.S. diet.

389
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:37,500
And so they were in they followed their various interventions for four months and then they collected blood pressure measurements.

390
00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:46,190
And so you can see again, we have on the Y axis, systolic blood pressure is at the top, figure diastolic.

391
00:49:46,430 --> 00:49:47,839
And then on the X axis,

392
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:57,410
we have the three different arms of the randomized controlled trial dash with weight management that included physical activity dash only.

393
00:49:58,310 --> 00:50:04,700
So no exercise and weight stable and use these just the control group.

394
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:09,230
Okay, so why don't we see in these results?

395
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:25,040
What do these findings indicate?

396
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:35,160
So if we just look at the top one at systolic blood pressure and if we look at that control group.

397
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:47,430
What's their systolic blood pressure relative to the to interventions that include the dash diet higher or lower?

398
00:50:48,150 --> 00:50:52,620
Higher. Yep. So the control group had the highest systolic blood pressure.

399
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:56,910
And weight management seems to do more to control it than exercise.

400
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:01,010
Yeah. So what I think, though,

401
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:11,190
what I like about the study is it demonstrates that even dash diet alone without physical activity resulted in a drop in systolic blood pressure.

402
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:22,650
But as Nicole just pointed out, we see even further drop in systolic blood pressure when there's the dash diet plus physical activity.

403
00:51:25,310 --> 00:51:31,190
Which may my in one of my notes had I didn't have a chance to go back to look at the article.

404
00:51:31,190 --> 00:51:34,190
But I think some of these folks were losing some weight, too.

405
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:39,170
So and we know weight loss can also improve blood pressure.

406
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:44,360
So again, it's an older study, but it very nicely highlights,

407
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:53,480
especially since this one has three arms where you have dash diet, no exercise, dash diet with exercise and so forth.

408
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:57,620
We can see how that impacts systolic blood pressure. So.

409
00:52:01,970 --> 00:52:07,430
And then lastly, this is a more recent study. This is from Ed Heinz.

410
00:52:09,950 --> 00:52:19,790
So let me just take a step back. We can assess, I mean, urinary 24 hour urinary sodium.

411
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:31,070
So a collection of urine over 24 hours measuring the year of the sodium content can give us an indication of sodium intake.

412
00:52:31,850 --> 00:52:34,820
It's actually pretty good at it. It's a pretty good biomarker.

413
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:44,540
So if somebody has low 24 hour urinary sodium, that's indicative that they had a low sodium intake in their diet.

414
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:49,730
Conversely, if their urinary sodium levels are high.

415
00:52:50,090 --> 00:53:09,020
That's reflective of high sodium intake. Why do you think NHANES wanted to include dietary and urinary sodium measurements to assess sodium intake?

416
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:15,800
In other words, as a proxy of sodium intake? Why not just measure sodium intake through a 24 hour recall?

417
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:24,030
You know, it's sort of like this. Items like bread are very difficult to keep track of.

418
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:30,940
And we have a bunch of sources of sodium. Exactly how much sodium is in those items could also be difficult.

419
00:53:30,970 --> 00:53:33,340
Well, this is pretty like you just measure it.

420
00:53:35,190 --> 00:53:42,700
Now, just going to say it's a more accurate measurement that you're measuring the actual intake rather than what people think they're getting.

421
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:52,990
So you're measuring the actual intake and it is hard. And even though 24 hour recalls are, you know, entered into a database that is pretty large.

422
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:57,250
So most breads, you know, we're going to know how much sodium in a lot of the breads.

423
00:53:58,030 --> 00:53:59,560
It's not going to be precise.

424
00:53:59,830 --> 00:54:07,480
And also, if they eat out or eat at restaurants or, you know, some of that information is not going to be in the database.

425
00:54:07,490 --> 00:54:14,850
So it's just going to be incomplete. And also, it's very hard how many if you do use sodium in food preparation.

426
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:20,590
So I made soup over the weekend. I couldn't begin to tell you how much sodium or salt I put in my soup.

427
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:24,610
I might be able to get all I can. Guess I'm going to be off.

428
00:54:24,610 --> 00:54:30,010
I know I am, because I I'm going to clue I was doing kitchens. So it's very difficult.

429
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:35,230
So urinary sodium is a very good biomarker.

430
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:40,030
So the point here is on the Y axis, we have systolic blood pressure.

431
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:48,610
At the top is urinary sodium. It's just broken down into quartiles.

432
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:54,070
Quartile one is the lowest to quartile. Four is the highest.

433
00:54:54,310 --> 00:54:57,850
The lower figure is urinary potassium.

434
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:05,110
So again, urinary potassium is a great biomarker of potassium intake.

435
00:55:05,290 --> 00:55:10,270
It's a great biomarker of fruit and vegetable intake. So what do we see here?

436
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:19,590
In general assaulting soap, you increase in potassium decreases.

437
00:55:20,490 --> 00:55:29,160
So yes, that's in relation to systolic blood pressure.

438
00:55:29,170 --> 00:55:38,550
So what if you break that down, Nicole? So sodium in relevant the context of systolic blood pressure or in relation to.

439
00:55:42,590 --> 00:55:46,580
Not less potassium in. Lower your blood pressure.

440
00:55:47,490 --> 00:55:48,740
Okay, so.

441
00:55:54,470 --> 00:56:06,830
If you looking at potassium down here, the higher the lower your urinary potassium excretion is, as Nicole pointed out, which is quartile one.

442
00:56:07,310 --> 00:56:16,460
So these are folks that have really low intakes of potassium because their urinary excretion of potassium is low, their blood pressure is higher.

443
00:56:17,870 --> 00:56:32,180
Likewise, if you look at quartile four, that represents people who have high intake of potassium.

444
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:43,880
Quartile four is the highest intake of potassium, but it's associated with the lowest level of systolic blood pressure.

445
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:50,120
So there's an inverse relationship as potassium intake increases.

446
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:54,310
Systolic blood pressure. Decreases.

447
00:56:57,410 --> 00:57:07,060
Sodium, on the other hand, is as sodium intake increases, blood pressure increases.

448
00:57:07,070 --> 00:57:13,130
So there's a direct relationship there, actually a fairly linear relationship.

449
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:24,770
But we see that. So with potassium, it's inverse higher potassium intake results in higher urinary potassium excretion.

450
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:30,140
Lower systolic blood pressure, whereas sodium.

451
00:57:32,210 --> 00:57:38,240
The flat tire sodium urinary excretion reflecting high sodium intake.

452
00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:48,229
You're going to end up with higher blood pressure. So this just very nicely highlights why these two nutrients are so critical with

453
00:57:48,230 --> 00:57:56,780
blood pressure and how we can assess using a biomarker as a proxy of intake.

454
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:00,260
Okay, I would do it for time here.

455
00:58:05,470 --> 00:58:16,330
Because we haven't been able to change sodium intake much in this country, even though there's been lots of public health campaigns,

456
00:58:16,330 --> 00:58:22,720
lots of evidence coming out in the journals that high sodium is problematic.

457
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:34,660
The American Heart Association convened a conference and this was actually conducted in December 2013, and it was a way to bring everyone together.

458
00:58:34,810 --> 00:58:43,360
So it brought academics, researchers, as well as the food industry to the table and said, we have a problem.

459
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:51,430
Cardiovascular disease, heart disease is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in this country.

460
00:58:51,430 --> 00:58:54,909
And sodium is a culprit. Right. It's a high risk factor.

461
00:58:54,910 --> 00:59:05,620
It's a significant risk factor for hypertension. So they met and there were a number of goals, short term and long term goals that were established.

462
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:09,400
For those of you interested, I have the article here,

463
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:16,300
but the reason for just going over this is to let you know or to give you some background to this data.

464
00:59:16,810 --> 00:59:24,340
So one of the things that came out of the conference was how can we determine how much sodium needs to be

465
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:34,240
reduced in the U.S. food supply that would actually have an impact on sodium intake in the population.

466
00:59:34,930 --> 00:59:42,950
So there was a series of modeling. This modeling that was done.

467
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:47,959
This is just two figures, but it's just really interesting.

468
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:58,190
And I just wanted to highlight this on the left is we have a figure here,

469
00:59:58,190 --> 01:00:07,610
sodium mil in milligrams per day is on the Y axis and then sodium reduction, indiscriminate reduction.

470
01:00:07,610 --> 01:00:17,900
So if we could reduce sodium in our whole food supply by five, ten, 15, all the way up to 75%,

471
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:26,690
what would it look like in terms of sodium reduction in the population that's including restaurants.

472
01:00:27,140 --> 01:00:29,090
So not just manufactured foods.

473
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:43,040
So if we if we get to the point where we can reduce the sodium of all manufactured food, it's a weird manufactured food if we reduce sodium by 25%.

474
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,280
I'm looking at this bar over here.

475
01:00:47,000 --> 01:01:00,290
If we reduce the sodium content of all manufactured food and restaurant food by 25%, that would result in the average sodium intake.

476
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:07,690
Of 2600 per day, 2600 milligrams per day.

477
01:01:10,390 --> 01:01:16,630
If we reduce the sodium content of all manufactured food and restaurant food by 50%,

478
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:25,120
then we have the mean sodium intake in the U.S. population would be 1700 milligrams.

479
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:31,580
That's a little drastic. But 25% is intriguing.

480
01:01:34,130 --> 01:01:49,940
Over here on the right is population, meaning it's the percent of the population that's meeting the target, the target being 2300 milligrams or 1500.

481
01:01:50,990 --> 01:02:03,080
And you can see that again on the bottom here on the x axis is the percent sodium reduction of the whole food supply in the US plus restaurant.

482
01:02:04,550 --> 01:02:14,290
So if we look at 25% reduction. 40% of the population would need the 2300 milligram goal.

483
01:02:15,550 --> 01:02:19,290
It's not quite 50% of the population, but it's 40%.

484
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:30,430
That would be pretty remarkable. So this is the kind of modeling that was done after that conference because it was recognized that we need to do

485
01:02:30,430 --> 01:02:40,480
something about our food supply because we know that most of the salt is being consumed by folks in the United States,

486
01:02:40,690 --> 01:02:46,960
is from outside the house. So it's coming from manufactured food, processed foods and restaurants.

487
01:02:47,740 --> 01:02:51,340
So I have the article here, if you're interested.

488
01:02:51,350 --> 01:02:56,350
There was other lot of other different modeling scenarios done.

489
01:02:56,680 --> 01:03:05,020
It was really quite interesting. They also did a survey of consumer knowledge and attitudes regarding sodium.

490
01:03:06,190 --> 01:03:10,780
And so this is at the top and these are just a sampling of some questions.

491
01:03:10,990 --> 01:03:16,480
So, for example, it says, I prefer items with reduced sodium instead of low and no sodium.

492
01:03:16,540 --> 01:03:27,610
I think they'll taste better. And I think that's gets back to what you were alluding to, Nicole, is a marketing approach that folks might be okay.

493
01:03:27,650 --> 01:03:34,060
It would be great to buy a product that says it's reduced sodium, but that low or no sodium might be unappealing.

494
01:03:36,130 --> 01:03:45,880
And so we have good percentages of people in their responses, and it's stratified by if they are currently limiting their sodium intake or not.

495
01:03:46,540 --> 01:03:56,170
And then there's just, again, attitudes. Foods that are low in sodium don't taste good and over 20% agreed.

496
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:03,129
The other one is, I think, lower, reduced sodium items or too expensive.

497
01:04:03,130 --> 01:04:07,300
Actually, not many responded to that or felt that that was true.

498
01:04:08,380 --> 01:04:15,430
And then I thought this last one was was funny. I would rather not know I'm eating reduced sodium product.

499
01:04:18,220 --> 01:04:24,460
Actually, not very many agreed with that, but thought it was an interesting question to include.

500
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:31,569
So the reason for putting this in is just to let you know that they in addition to doing this modeling and so forth,

501
01:04:31,570 --> 01:04:41,290
they did survey, you know, a populated national sample population to just find out attitudes and knowledge of sodium.

502
01:04:42,970 --> 01:04:49,300
So what came out of all that is we now have a sodium reduction initiative from the Food and Drug Administration.

503
01:04:50,170 --> 01:04:55,780
It is not mandatory, is voluntary. So they have it.

504
01:04:56,810 --> 01:05:11,410
The industry guide just came out last year. They have set sodium targets for a whole slew of foods and really they're more food

505
01:05:11,410 --> 01:05:17,870
categories and that manufacturers need to start striving for these sodium targets.

506
01:05:21,130 --> 01:05:30,040
So if you use if you go to this link, you can actually access the industry guide and it has tables and it has all of

507
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:34,770
the different kind of food groups and it has what the sodium target needs to be.

508
01:05:38,590 --> 01:05:49,180
These targets are expected to reduce sodium intake on average by 12% per day or reducing sodium intake from 3400 to 3000.

509
01:05:52,200 --> 01:06:00,630
It's a two and a half year project. And again, it's not mandatory, it's voluntary.

510
01:06:01,020 --> 01:06:05,790
So I was curious how many manufacturers, a number of any factories have already started.

511
01:06:05,850 --> 01:06:15,450
In fact, there's foods already that have manufacturers or already reached the target that was set by the FDA.

512
01:06:15,870 --> 01:06:22,110
But I kept trying to find out how many companies are actually excuse me doing it.

513
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:26,670
And I couldn't find anything on the FDA website. So then I just did a Google search.

514
01:06:27,090 --> 01:06:32,280
Well, there's a food and beverage. Insider.

515
01:06:32,970 --> 01:06:43,560
Dot com. And I hopped on and I typed in the food the sodium initiative and there was actually someone who was writing about it and says there,

516
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:52,770
I have no way of knowing if it's true that roughly 70% of food food manufacturing companies in the US have already.

517
01:06:54,770 --> 01:07:00,620
At least one of their food products in their portfolio has already been reformulated.

518
01:07:02,630 --> 01:07:08,000
So I thought, well, I had no way of verifying if that's true, but I would love to believe that.

519
01:07:09,140 --> 01:07:21,400
So I'm hopeful. Yeah. With reformulating to reduce sodium to please I don't want to you know have a pumped up then the oil content or the sugar.

520
01:07:21,410 --> 01:07:28,220
Is there any evidence that they so they are not supposed to bump up the sugar content.

521
01:07:28,460 --> 01:07:29,810
I don't know about the oil.

522
01:07:30,350 --> 01:07:40,159
And one student who actually worked and worked in food industry in one of our second year students, the important point it's taking,

523
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:46,460
some companies who are want to be involved a while because for the foods that they produce,

524
01:07:46,730 --> 01:07:52,390
the sodium is actually plays a key role in being anti-microbial.

525
01:07:53,570 --> 01:08:01,940
And so if you reduce sodium, then its role of being anti-microbial has been compromised.

526
01:08:02,180 --> 01:08:06,049
And so the problem is, is a lot of manufacturers have to find alternatives.

527
01:08:06,050 --> 01:08:07,010
And so the FDA,

528
01:08:07,220 --> 01:08:16,400
I noticed there was a couple of technical documents about what they're trying to help manufacturers come up with alternatives for these issues.

529
01:08:16,730 --> 01:08:24,860
And it's not just sodium for flavor that it has to do with shelf stability and what have you.

530
01:08:25,130 --> 01:08:29,030
So we'll see.

531
01:08:29,690 --> 01:08:40,730
I'm hopeful. I want to be optimistic about this, but I wanted you to be aware of it so you can you can read about the initiative on this link.

532
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:44,809
This is for those of you not familiar.

533
01:08:44,810 --> 01:08:49,700
I wasn't familiar with this national network of public health institutes.

534
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:59,390
This is a nonprofit organization that brings public health organizations, academics, you know,

535
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:07,340
universities and so forth to the table, including food industry to work on public health issues.

536
01:09:07,340 --> 01:09:13,250
And so they took a pretty key role in bringing food industry to the table.

537
01:09:13,850 --> 01:09:17,630
And they tend to work with they often work with the CDC and so forth.

538
01:09:17,660 --> 01:09:27,559
So for those of you interested, you can read about it. And then lastly, this is a document on the CDC in this course.

539
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:34,940
It's about what community based interventions have been implemented that address sodium in particular.

540
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:46,370
This is a document that goes through interventions that have been shown to either be best promising or emerging.

541
01:09:47,030 --> 01:09:51,290
And these are sodium related sodium reduction interventions.

542
01:09:51,290 --> 01:09:59,120
So I wanted you to have this resource and I haven't had a chance to read it, but there's some really interesting approaches.

543
01:09:59,390 --> 01:10:03,760
So. These are resources for you.

544
01:10:06,850 --> 01:10:10,300
And lastly, wonderful holiday break. You too.

545
01:10:11,260 --> 01:10:14,470
Any questions about what you covered today?

546
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:18,610
Oh, I have a question regarding the Dash diet. Yep.

547
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:24,940
So can you go back to the script? Is it one of the studies?

548
01:10:25,090 --> 01:10:28,320
Yes. That's the theory difference.

549
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:29,450
This one. Yeah.

550
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:39,280
So I'm wondering, like for the third point of the control diet, so if you consume lower sodium, even if you're on a typical American diet,

551
01:10:39,550 --> 01:10:48,550
you'll still have lower systolic blood pressure than those who consume higher sodium, but on a dash diet.

552
01:10:49,090 --> 01:10:52,309
But that doesn't mean that it's healthier.

553
01:10:52,310 --> 01:11:02,410
Right. In general, their usual diet. Oh, I mean, the third point of the control that compared to the first one, first point of the dash diet.

554
01:11:03,070 --> 01:11:06,460
So are you talking about sodium levels? Yes.

555
01:11:06,670 --> 01:11:14,160
Okay. Because of the third point is lower than the first point of the Dash diet.

556
01:11:14,170 --> 01:11:21,340
Right. With regards to the blood pressure, you're talking about lower versus higher.

557
01:11:21,940 --> 01:11:33,910
Yes. Okay. So on the dash diet, as well as the control diet, we're talking about higher being 3.5 grams of sodium versus 1.2 grams.

558
01:11:34,270 --> 01:11:41,960
Yeah. And in both the dash diet and the controlled diet, there is improvement.

559
01:11:41,980 --> 01:11:45,260
Right. Yeah. So your question is. I'm sorry.

560
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:50,360
So my question is, if you are on the controlled diet but you consume less sodium.

561
01:11:50,380 --> 01:11:59,770
Yep. You have actually have a better have a lower blood pressure than those on the dash diet, but consume higher sodium.

562
01:12:00,490 --> 01:12:04,750
Well, you're talking about the change is more dress is more dramatic.

563
01:12:04,990 --> 01:12:08,650
Going from intermediate to low in the control diet.

564
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:17,890
No, no, I'm talking about that. You actually have lower blood pressure, even if you're consume a controlled diet, but you consume less sodium.

565
01:12:19,570 --> 01:12:23,410
Okay. Except the systolic blood pressure.

566
01:12:23,650 --> 01:12:29,590
If you look at the control diet at the lowest level of sodium, it's still higher than the dash diet.

567
01:12:30,490 --> 01:12:36,080
Oh, okay. Sorry.

568
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:40,370
If you all go. Oh, go talk to you after this class.

569
01:12:40,390 --> 01:12:43,510
Yeah, I'm not. Yeah, let's.

570
01:12:43,510 --> 01:12:49,390
We can touch base about it. Yeah. Yeah. All right, everybody, have a great break.

571
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:56,259
If anybody has questions about their one pager or finding an intervention, I'm going to hang out for a few minutes.

572
01:12:56,260 --> 01:12:59,860
So I'm going to.
