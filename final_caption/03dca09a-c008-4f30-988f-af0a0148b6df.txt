1
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:04,770
I think that's true.

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:24,780
I think it's I mean, obviously, as you probably know, the astronauts, I think it's always looked at all the problems that we have.

3
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:32,790
Yeah. What should we do?

4
00:00:33,360 --> 00:01:00,270
I'm really sorry to interrupt you, because that sounds like really, you know, is absolutely just dramatic.

5
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:11,010
No. How do they not result from the worst case scenario?

6
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:16,390
Right. What is it that the U.S. is ready for this problem?

7
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:27,720
And I think they just gave it only when I've got the money.

8
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:33,950
Oh, I see. What is what you say? Okay.

9
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:49,380
I think we should be like with the U.S.

10
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:55,860
Start with this. With my team. When we get virtually all the answers are, leave me alone.

11
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:03,450
What was it like for you at the finish line physically?

12
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,280
I don't know. Yeah, I don't know.

13
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:35,130
All right. So rather than the claims that there were no how to make sure that all of this stuff is kind of like just his response was to throw out,

14
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:42,060
like, a lot more stuff, right?

15
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:50,729
Yeah. Just start counting. All right. I got confused because I didn't know if anyone knows this,

16
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:56,400
but Michigan used to do classes starting 10 minutes after the hour, and then they ended on time.

17
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,030
It was the dumbest thing I'd ever experienced that you didn't do.

18
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:05,400
I think every person that didn't settle down in Texas, somebody switched, but I forgot about it.

19
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:15,930
So how's hearing me in the back, if I don't mind?

20
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:22,140
My I always gets tired, reads like that. So let me know if I start mumbling, I'll figure out a way.

21
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:30,600
Then I can make up. I wrote my name on the board and my email address just in case you have any questions afterwards.

22
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:40,380
My name is Jesse. I did my master's here and then my Ph.D. went away for a postdoc, and now I'm doing another postdoc here with Joe.

23
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:46,490
So I do research in this field, kind of this isn't a field.

24
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,740
This was the title of the lecture that I inherited,

25
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:55,950
and at first I didn't want to keep it because it's a mouthful and it's fecal oral foodborne waterborne transmission.

26
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,870
And I thought, that's really just one thing,

27
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:05,070
and I've tried to put it all together and then eventually realized that that's not really the case as I was putting slides together.

28
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:06,990
So in general,

29
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:17,100
foodborne and waterborne transmission or pathogens are spread through the fecal oral route of transmission that you may already be familiar with,

30
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:21,030
starts with feces, ends with consumption.

31
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,780
But there are a number of exceptions to that.

32
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:32,040
So this is I don't have a Venn diagram in my head, but there is mostly overlap, but there are some exceptions.

33
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:40,010
So in this case, we are going to be talking about fecal, foodborne and waterborne transmission as separate things that really go together.

34
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:54,570
Boundaries but should. I was curious, is this a master's level class from the undergrad program, also named meetings?

35
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:58,670
I don't know how that questions. Thanks for satisfying my curiosity.

36
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:08,620
Okay. Some key points to get out of the lecture. I hope by the end that you'll be able to describe to people oral route of transmission.

37
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:19,670
Talk about the specific health risks that come about from pathogens in the throat and the relative burden of various diseases.

38
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:22,910
And depending on where you're at, just the conditions that come.

39
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:29,810
Some specific routes of transmission and how they are different depending on where you live.

40
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:40,130
Interventions that can actually prevent this route from occurring and largely the role of what here I call societal wealth.

41
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:52,340
It's kind of hard to describe that in just a couple of words, but the fecal or root and waterborne pathogens is something that really,

42
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:58,790
depending on where you live, depending on how wealthy the country or areas live in, is experienced very differently.

43
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:07,760
And that's true for environmental health in general, because as wealth increases as what a lot of people call development increases,

44
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:14,360
although I think that's gross, our relationship with the environment changes drastically.

45
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:20,719
That really turns into how much do we control the environment, how much do we impose on the environment,

46
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,150
and how much do we experience it as part of the natural world?

47
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:33,200
And so I think more than probably most of the different pathways that you talk about in this class,

48
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:41,930
this is a good chance to think about the way that society really dictates how we experience disease,

49
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:46,010
what diseases we experience, and how bad it is for the people who are experiencing.

50
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:55,580
Okay. So I'm going to start by talking about what the constant features of the people who are out of transmission are across the globe.

51
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:02,230
So wherever you live, what is something? What are the things that you can expect to be consistent no matter where?

52
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:14,230
And the best example of something that's consistent is how the people who are out actually occurs.

53
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:17,649
And this is demonstrated by this classic diagram.

54
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:21,280
And if anyone's ever seen it, I hope so. This is the diagram.

55
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:30,850
I don't know when it was first developed, but a long, long time ago to describe how people get infected from feces.

56
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:39,580
I think there's a lot of there's a lot of cleverness to it and trying to fit things that start with the letter F, I think has gotten out of hand.

57
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:47,739
And that really needs to change because now there's all sorts of stuff that should be on here that isn't like animals, but animals isn't a word.

58
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:52,750
And so they we stick with the F diagram. And I do think it's a convenient way of talking about this.

59
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:58,210
But this is consistent. This is something this is just how the fecal oral route of transmission occurs.

60
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:08,560
And so it is simplified, but it starts with a person who is sick, someone's infected with a pathogen,

61
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:13,060
which I assume you guys have been learning all about infectious disease in general. So same idea.

62
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,860
Difference is it's infecting their gut.

63
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:27,280
So an infected person defecates they have their feces then is it contains the pathogens that can transmit the infection to new people.

64
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:33,100
So after the pathogens are excreted with feces,

65
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:39,459
they can be spread through the environment or directly to new people who are susceptible to

66
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:48,490
disease through various pathways that immediately start with f traditionally we think of flies,

67
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:57,280
fields and floors, so flies being like landing on any uncovered feces, tracking it somewhere or landing on your food,

68
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:01,660
landing on you, whatever it is, they're carrying feces around on their physical bodies.

69
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:05,710
They also, like, consume most of it and then vomit it up or something.

70
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:13,390
Really. Remember, fields and floors is like, I don't know, I think it's not on there, but it should be.

71
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,940
Any contacts that we come into feces on our feet can be dragged around.

72
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:25,990
In many locations where open defecation is common, where like toilets and latrines aren't really used.

73
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:30,310
Fields, floors full of feces can be spread around environmentally.

74
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:37,080
Through that way, foods and fluids are very common.

75
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:42,130
That's why the lecture includes or the title titled Lecture Includes Foodborne Disease and waterborne disease.

76
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:50,290
These are really the main ways that it's spread, or at least what we think of and what we understand the best.

77
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:57,590
And then fingers, hands is more convenient, but again, cleverness.

78
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:03,770
So any contact with your hands sees infected people.

79
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:04,770
You're spreading it around that way.

80
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:13,260
So these roots of transmission can bring pathogens to a new potential host, someone who is susceptible to disease.

81
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:17,640
They become infected and then they become the infected person and the cycle starts over.

82
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:24,480
So if diagram shows you how the fecal oral route leads to new infections.

83
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:32,190
And so as far as constant things, no matter where you live, that's pretty much it. That's the basic biology is the same.

84
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:39,030
Everything else is very different because this is a very socio environmentally mediated set of diseases.

85
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:47,280
So I'll move on to some things that are variable about the fecal or root of transmission across national wealth,

86
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:51,420
which again, I try to come up with different ways of describing what I mentioned.

87
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:54,690
National wealth is kind of a convenient placeholder for reality.

88
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:04,800
National wealth is just this measure like GDP that we invented and we think really covers everything.

89
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:09,120
But there's a lot more that could be discussed on the sociological side of this.

90
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,160
Like what is a nation and what is wealth?

91
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:19,980
Were you a colonized country or a colonizing country, or are you a group within a country with political power?

92
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:26,100
Are you not? Does your nation have political power relative to its neighbors, etc., etc.?

93
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:31,500
The point is, it's very complicated. So national wealth is just a convenient placeholder.

94
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:37,500
One way to think about this. Okay, so what's variable depending on where you live in the world?

95
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:41,430
The health burden, first of all. And.

96
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:48,500
The primary health effect of these pathogens is diarrheal disease.

97
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:52,839
So I wanted to go into a little bit of details. This is an infectious disease IP class.

98
00:11:52,840 --> 00:12:00,280
I know not all of you probably have a bio background or anything, but I promise this won't be too in-depth.

99
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:05,290
But I want to talk about what diarrheal disease actually is and what the disease looks like inside your body.

100
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:10,060
So there are two different types of give you a teaser.

101
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:14,220
There's an inflammatory diarrhea. And Secretary how do I say that?

102
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:23,920
Secretory diarrhea and think about that. So for inflammatory diarrhea, what we're looking at here, it's not showing up.

103
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:35,740
It's a laser pointer pointer.

104
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:48,510
But there's more now. Okay. So to orient on the left side, we have a healthy system, a healthy GI system.

105
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:56,129
On the right, we have infection. And here we have your in your intestines.

106
00:12:56,130 --> 00:13:02,400
This is your small intestine, food, water coming through here, being digested as it goes left to right.

107
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,660
Within the walls of this GI tract,

108
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:15,599
you have these epithelial cells that have these cool folds that allow food and nutrients and things to be absorbed in.

109
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:26,610
These cells are controlling all of your digestion. So what happens with inflammatory diarrhea is a pathogen like here.

110
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:36,169
It infects the cells and causing inflammation within the epithelial cells.

111
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:40,640
And so this represents damage to the cell itself.

112
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:59,540
And this allows see you can see that it allows a gap to form in between the cells and water is able to get out of the cells into your gut from there.

113
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:06,110
Sorry, that was a mouthful. But the point is it damages the cells and then water leaks into your gut.

114
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:15,200
And so now your gut, that's normally keeping a very tight control over how much water it is absorbing versus how much it is secreting,

115
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:24,500
leaving just healthy stool. A healthy body is releasing too much water into the gut and you get runny feces.

116
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:33,090
Which can dehydrate your body very quickly. So this is one form of diarrhea and how it actually occurs.

117
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,850
The next form is most famously represented by cholera.

118
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:48,510
And I just find this fascinating. There wasn't a good model of the same picture, even though this doesn't apply still.

119
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:56,140
But in this case, pathogens are inhibiting electrolyte transfer in the epithelial cells, specifically resulting in secretions.

120
00:14:56,140 --> 00:15:04,770
So it is the same idea. Water is being pushed, being released into the GI tract more than it should be.

121
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:05,729
But in this case,

122
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:18,330
what happens is the pathogen is doing damage to these ion channels that are controlling sodium and chloride transfer across the cells.

123
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:21,940
And this is the way that your body controls water.

124
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:32,550
In general, the sodium chloride channels moving, making areas saltier or less salty so that water moves across through osmosis.

125
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:39,309
And so these pathogens damage the ion channels or inhibit them,

126
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:49,330
do various things to change how they're behaving, which is ends up resulting in excess ions in your gut itself.

127
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:56,740
Those ions are being either over secreted from the epithelial cells or they're not being taken in to the cells.

128
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:02,170
And so there's too much salt within your intestines.

129
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:09,550
And because of osmosis, the area that has too much salt attracts water.

130
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:13,930
And these epithelial cells are just porous. Water can move freely between them.

131
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:21,850
And so water's just flowing out of the cells into the GI tract following the water to create an osmotic balance.

132
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:26,310
And the cells can't control that.

133
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,210
They can't do anything.

134
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:37,990
And so eventually you just have too much water staying in your body, not being absorbed, and that is resulting in very watery stool.

135
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:41,590
And the water that you need in your body isn't being retained.

136
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:57,280
So a question for you all is why the pathogens would do this, like evolutionarily, assuming that some agency are pretending.

137
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:05,560
What's the benefit of them for causing diarrhea? I won't ask a ton of questions, so don't worry about them.

138
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:09,100
Yeah. Spread. Spread. Right. Exactly.

139
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:14,800
So same thing. Is Koven making you cough anything, making you cough, sneeze?

140
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:18,759
It is the way that these spread is through feces.

141
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:27,700
And so whatever gets them to release the most feces and the most copies of their genetic material out into the wild, the better.

142
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:41,629
So it's out by a lesson done. So I said diarrheal disease is like the primary, the main concern,

143
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:50,070
but it's really specific to what's happening in lower income countries and in countries with less wealth.

144
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:53,300
Diarrheal disease is very commonplace and very deadly.

145
00:17:56,540 --> 00:18:05,240
Annually the here are some rates of deaths per 100,000 children younger than five years olds in sub-Saharan Africa,

146
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:11,420
almost 186, just about globally, 71.

147
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:14,840
And in high income countries, only 1.3.

148
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:20,360
So there's this huge differential in how many people are dying from diarrheal disease.

149
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:32,450
And depending on where you live and I focus on children here because that's generally the biggest concern we have with diarrheal disease,

150
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:38,780
is that it kills a lot of children globally, mostly through dehydration.

151
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:45,859
The idea is just that their bodies are too small and don't have a lot of water to lose.

152
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:54,560
And so when these pathogens get in and cause excess water loss, dehydration happens very quickly in young children and can very quickly lead to death.

153
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:04,290
So annually. In this age group of young children, there are 446,000 deaths each year,

154
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:09,750
which makes it now the fifth leading cause of death among children under five worldwide.

155
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:19,920
And they don't actually represent I was surprised to see this mindset being that they don't represent the largest number of deaths.

156
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:24,450
And globally, they're like 1.2 million deaths from diarrhea every year.

157
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:34,980
But given their small age group just 0 to 5 years, so low population numbers, they face the highest burden of deaths relative to their size.

158
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:44,669
But elderly people and people with compromised immune systems end up making

159
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:48,270
the bulk that making up the bulk of the actual number of deaths every year,

160
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:51,080
which is over a million. And.

161
00:19:52,770 --> 00:20:02,610
This is actually it's surprisingly good news for me when I see new updated numbers, like when I prep something like this and see 446,000 now,

162
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:09,450
because in 2000, the number was 1.2 million deaths every year among children under five.

163
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:14,830
It was the second leading cause of death at the time, and historically it was the second leading cause of death for many, many years.

164
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:21,900
When I got interested in this research or this field, it was 800,000 something.

165
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:24,959
And so each year it's actually been reduced quite a lot.

166
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:33,750
And there's a ton of attention on diarrheal disease as a preventable, very preventable, treatable illness that's killing children.

167
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:41,400
And so there has been great progress over time. So just to try to leave you on, not too much of a bar.

168
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:49,700
Okay. So that's the situation broadly and briefly in lower income countries.

169
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:56,299
In high income countries, infectious diarrheal disease is usually not as dangerous.

170
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:59,660
It's not something we think of as a very regular occurrence in our life.

171
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:06,260
People aren't losing their children or their young babies to diarrhea all the time, but it does happen.

172
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:18,290
So one of the major ways to juxtapose greatly is traveler's diarrhea, something that 30 to 70% of people experience if they're traveling abroad.

173
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,280
That's one of the most common ways that we encounter infectious diarrhea. And that can be severe, certainly.

174
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,670
But the point is that it's not something we commonly experience here.

175
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:37,840
Within countries like the U.S. But people with suppressed immune systems are at risk of very severe disease.

176
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:47,590
And outbreaks do occur occasionally. So one of the biggest ones, the biggest one in the U.S. ever was in 1993.

177
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:51,550
There was an outbreak in Milwaukee of Cryptosporidium.

178
00:21:53,500 --> 00:22:00,790
For a while, no one knew what was going on. It was kind of like the beginning of this most recent pandemic of just this

179
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:05,830
mystery as people were getting sick and no idea how wide it was going to spread.

180
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:16,960
By the end of it, there were 403,000 estimated cases in the Milwaukee area, and only 1% of those were hospitalized.

181
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:23,470
But 66% of those people who were hospitalized were immunocompromised in some way.

182
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:31,030
And similarly, there were 68 deaths, and 85% of those people had AIDS at the time.

183
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:42,020
So this was an example of. A rare failure of water treatment in the U.S. and it resulted in this massive outbreak.

184
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:49,790
They still don't really know exactly what happened. But you know where Milwaukee is on the western coast of Lake Michigan.

185
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:55,520
That's where it's taking in its water that it treats for for drinking water.

186
00:22:55,910 --> 00:23:02,810
And another town nearby along the lake was dumping their sewage into Lake Michigan.

187
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:14,690
It's very normal. And that water from some town the sewage was being was part of the intake for drinking water for Milwaukee.

188
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:20,569
And then when they had a failure at their treatment plant, there was a massive outbreak.

189
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:30,980
And so when that happens, it very quickly can turn into a major public health crisis within the U.S. and other countries.

190
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:35,120
But this is rare. This is 1993 is the the biggest 1.2.

191
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:47,820
And that was a while ago. But that's not to say that waterborne diseases aren't a significant concern in the U.S. and other high income countries.

192
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:53,040
They do have a high burden. So this is from 2014.

193
00:23:53,040 --> 00:24:03,990
But there were over 7 million illnesses due to waterborne diseases every year and over 100,000 hospitalizations and almost 7000 deaths.

194
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:12,780
But just again, to contrast how the epidemiology is different depending on where you live in the U.S.

195
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:17,939
Non diarrheal diseases and pathogens that aren't spread through the fecal oral route

196
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:22,290
and transmission are actually causing most of the waterborne deaths in the U.S.

197
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:31,620
So what is the number like? 6600 is probably about these summed up.

198
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:37,050
These are the leading causes, the pathogens that caused the most deaths in the U.S. each year.

199
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:41,459
And so non tuberculosis,

200
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:50,850
mycobacterial infection and these pseudomonas species are all opportunistic pathogens that usually you see in hospital settings.

201
00:24:51,240 --> 00:25:01,090
You guys probably already cover that in this class, or you will, but opportunistic pathogens that spread when they're given this rare opportunity.

202
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:05,969
And so largely people with compromised immune systems will get infections with

203
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:09,450
these pathogens or in hospital settings where everyone's sick all the time.

204
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:16,290
Legionnaires disease is actually a an airborne disease that comes from water.

205
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:25,140
The pathogen is usually found in like air conditioners and tracks, ducts and stuff in buildings.

206
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:29,490
And then sometimes it gets kicked up into the air. You actually breathe it in and become infected that way.

207
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:33,750
And swimmer's ear apparently kills over 200 people a year.

208
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:41,960
So Rouzier. That's crazy. I'm kind of terrified swimming in a lake now, which is all the time, because it's amazing.

209
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:53,390
So none of these, I think, are fecal oral pathogens, but they are what are causing the most waterborne deaths in the U.S.

210
00:25:55,610 --> 00:26:02,210
In contrast, but somewhat similarly severe foodborne illness usually does involve diarrhea in the US.

211
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:13,130
So the on the left we have the top five pathogens that contribute to hospitalization from foodborne illnesses and.

212
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:25,330
Salmonella, norovirus, campylobacter stec e coli are all fecal oral pathogens and Toxoplasma I think also is.

213
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:30,910
But you get it from cats. So I don't know necessarily how that fits in.

214
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:41,560
That's an interesting one. I recommend looking up. And similarly, on the right are the top five pathogens that lead to death from foodborne illness.

215
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:45,160
Salmonella. Norovirus. Campylobacter. All fecal or pathogens.

216
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:58,280
Toxoplasma and Listeria? I don't think so. So foodborne illnesses in the U.S. usually do involved area, but the burden,

217
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:03,530
as you can see from the number of deaths, are not as high as some of those waterborne pathogens.

218
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:15,050
Okay. So to review diarrheal disease is generally what we think of with fecal oral routes incredibly common in most of the world.

219
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:24,379
A huge cause of death among children. But in countries with a lot of wealth, the same epidemiology doesn't really present.

220
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:31,850
We're not seeing diarrhea as much. We are getting other pathogens that are still waterborne or foodborne, but not causing death in the same way.

221
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:39,569
All right. So another segment of things that is different depending on where you live are

222
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:43,740
the actual transmission pathways that are leading people to become infected.

223
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:47,730
So coming back to our fancy diagram.

224
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:53,810
The details of it will look different across contexts.

225
00:27:54,080 --> 00:28:00,559
This is a very simple and a simplified diagram, but if you actually wanted to come up with what it looks like,

226
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,870
depending on where you live, it would look very different.

227
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:10,630
So first of all, look at the different sources of fecal contamination that can lead to exposure and disease.

228
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:15,830
So what what does it look like for the feces of infected people?

229
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,600
To potentially go into the environment being where you live.

230
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:31,510
So in wealthy countries, we generally handle that with sewerage and coverage with sewage is very high across almost all wealthy countries.

231
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:42,679
The idea is everywhere has toilets with running water defecate into those flushed

232
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:51,520
away with a couple of gallons of water and from each building a home business.

233
00:28:52,100 --> 00:29:05,390
It is transmitted through a series of pipes that connect to a large municipal water main, carrying the sewerage away in a sealed safe container.

234
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:12,890
So no one is coming into contact with it. Never come. You never see it after a flush because it's just flushed away with the entire city's waste.

235
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:16,370
And it's a very elaborate system.

236
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:22,900
If we could dig up all the roads and just take a look at the sewerage system in Ann Arbor, it would be impressive.

237
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:26,050
It's there massive. It takes a ton of work.

238
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:36,020
It's there are huge municipal projects. And generally in countries, usually the sewage, the wastewater is treated.

239
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:39,380
And so in this schematic, you can see what that looks like.

240
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:42,139
Don't worry too much about the details.

241
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:50,300
But from homes and businesses, the sewage is transported to a wastewater treatment plant, which is this whole apparatus.

242
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,160
And one of the cool things that I just want to say is how to treat wastewater.

243
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:59,840
Generally, what we do, the main process is very simple.

244
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:03,620
You don't actually have to give a lot of inputs.

245
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:10,340
You just let bacteria eat all of the feces and all of the other pathogens until everything is disinfected.

246
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:20,990
Naturally, you just have to filter it, keep it moving and spinning, maybe feed the bacteria a little bit if it needs a little bit of primer.

247
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:24,139
But in general, bacteria do wastewater treatment.

248
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:32,360
For us, it's an incredibly efficient system, but the infrastructure to get it done is very expensive and very elaborate.

249
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:41,710
And after it's treated or sometimes before it's treated, if it's never treated, the water has to go somewhere.

250
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:47,390
So from the sewers to the plants and then it just continues down into some body of water,

251
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:55,050
usually most often a river, sometimes reservoirs or lakes, and occasionally directly into groundwater itself.

252
00:30:56,430 --> 00:31:05,520
So one point is that if your city is in taking water from a river and using that for drinking water

253
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:12,180
and there's any other city or community upstream of you putting their treated wastewater into that,

254
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:17,550
then your drinking water is their wastewater, their wastewater or someone else's drink or vice versa.

255
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:24,630
I'm really into wastewater reuse. That's my research. It's something that needs to happen because we're running out of water and stuff.

256
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:28,860
And people are really squeamish about it.

257
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:33,960
But something that I really want to advocate for is the fact that everyone's already reusing wastewater for drinking water.

258
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:39,280
You just don't think about it or you know it. Sorry.

259
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:43,340
There's no point in that. Just supported the council meeting or something.

260
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:47,520
Do you ever hear? All right. This is the annual Ann Arbor Wastewater Treatment Plant.

261
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:54,040
They're big, they're very elaborate. They're very expensive.

262
00:31:54,070 --> 00:32:04,720
So this is what we can do in high income countries where we have the ability to put a ton of resources into something like this.

263
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:10,840
And obviously, maintenance is also very high. Okay.

264
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:14,650
So that's urban communities, semi-urban.

265
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:25,860
Pretty common. But for something like 20 to 30% of the US, rural communities are too spread out to do sewer and sewer systems.

266
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:31,720
And so they generally rely on onsite sanitation options such as septic tank systems.

267
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:38,530
And from rural Texas, this is what we had and it didn't work very good.

268
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:45,370
It has huge variation in quality, and maintenance is pretty expensive and stuff.

269
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:52,240
But a septic system is similar in principle.

270
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:57,670
It's an underwater or underground tank that just stores waste that's flushed into it.

271
00:32:57,970 --> 00:33:07,660
And over time, the bacteria do their job of treatment just very naturally consume all the bad stuff and consume the waste.

272
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:14,680
And eventually you have to clear sludge out just the leftovers that is safe.

273
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:24,640
But if built correctly, this is a way of making waste safe again without anyone ever having to come into contact with it.

274
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:29,560
It's flushed, sits in a septic tank and you move on with your life.

275
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:40,190
No one has to be exposed. Another potential.

276
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,480
Source of exposure in high income countries.

277
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:51,820
But everywhere is bathroom use. So every time you use the bathroom, you're.

278
00:33:53,070 --> 00:34:01,770
Potentially. Risking exposure or could expose other people, but it's very easily mitigated with handwashing.

279
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:09,030
And so this is something that you can't really avoid, but is one potential source of exposure.

280
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:15,380
Okay. So I'm your country's. We collect our waste.

281
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:21,680
So then first part of the diagram where feces is from infected people is getting out into the world.

282
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:30,380
For the most part, that just doesn't happen. We do a very thorough, very engineered job of collecting waste and preventing that stuff.

283
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:36,920
In contrast, in lower income countries, it's obviously because of the disease risk.

284
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:47,540
That step is not achieved. So in urban areas, the toilets flushing, toilets flushing, latrines are very common.

285
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:53,130
They can be collected in sewer systems similar to what we do here.

286
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:57,300
But what's usually missing is that last step of actually treating it.

287
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:05,490
In low income countries, an estimated 8% of wastewater that's generated is ever treated.

288
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:12,780
I think it's 18% in lower middle income countries and like 38% in upper middle income countries.

289
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:22,710
So generally, wastewater treatment is very rare across the world. So even when you are somewhere like Mexico City, where I go to my work, my research,

290
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:31,190
it's collected but then just transmitted somewhere else and then eventually it looks like this.

291
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:36,990
Oh, that's literally Mexico. This is my picture. So this one's not this is iStockphoto or whatever that is.

292
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:41,630
Eventually, if the wastewater is not treated, it still has to go somewhere.

293
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:49,080
So it's very common just to dump it out into a body of water, a river or in this case, looks like a lake just to get rid of it.

294
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:54,720
And now, obviously, that lake or river is a source of contamination in Mexico.

295
00:35:55,050 --> 00:36:05,370
Mexico City actually sends their wastewater to the next state over where they use it for agricultural irrigation.

296
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:22,290
And so this is a canal that's full of untreated wastewater in a rural town that uses it for irrigation.

297
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:27,480
Overall, it's a great thing to strive for.

298
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:34,499
Again, reuse wastewater. It's a good thing. Otherwise the water is all wasted, but it's untreated.

299
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:38,130
It poses significant health risks to the people who live there and actually work with the water.

300
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:45,240
And it smells terrible. This is it kind of looks pretty. But that like right there, if you're taking a picture, it's gross.

301
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,250
So that's like in urban areas they can collect waste,

302
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:57,090
but it's very uncommon to actually treat it and in more rural areas, in places with a lot of villages.

303
00:36:57,390 --> 00:37:01,590
Pit latrines are usually the most affordable and most common sanitation option.

304
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:06,180
And so this is what they use all over the place in the world.

305
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:14,490
So a pit latrine is exactly that. It's people defecate into a pit that's dug into the ground.

306
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:21,990
And when the pit is full, they cover it and a new pit is dug.

307
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:31,230
Over time, the waste in a pit just gets consumed by bacteria, turns into soil over enough time that's just completely inert and safe.

308
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:43,999
And it's just part of your yard again. The range and quality of pit latrines is very huge from like crude holes that are

309
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:50,299
just dug in the ground without a protective cover to improved and improved latrines,

310
00:37:50,300 --> 00:38:00,170
which is a technical term with concrete slabs that are preventing contact or putting some space between the user and the pit.

311
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:05,870
And then there are fancy latrines that.

312
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:15,180
Can be flushed, which is important. Water. Water is a very important component of safely discarding waste.

313
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,790
And they often have, like, ventilation pipes to keep bad smells out.

314
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:28,100
To make it a better experience. And so a variation is very high end.

315
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:35,670
And something I would point out is just that the the use of a train is not very.

316
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:41,489
I think you might just be a foreign idea in places that are used to toilets,

317
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:45,450
but the difference between sitting and squatting over latrine isn't important.

318
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:54,090
So long as the infrastructure is clean and you have water to flush or it's automatically flushed can be just as safe.

319
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:59,400
It's really a cultural difference. So not something that's inherently.

320
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:09,610
Inherently dangerous or anything. But latrines that are not well constructed.

321
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:13,810
So maybe something like these, this is just the aboveground structure.

322
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:22,810
This is like the user experience. Here you can see a lining of the pit that was pretend something like concrete.

323
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:30,940
I can see brick, various things. That lining is important depending on where the pit is located.

324
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:38,320
Because if a pit is not well-constructed and it is near ground water, the pit,

325
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:43,180
the contents of the pit can leak out and get into the groundwater contaminating that source.

326
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:54,409
So again, we're talking about like that first part of the FDA exam and pit latrines are very common,

327
00:39:54,410 --> 00:40:03,350
but there are also 673 million people worldwide estimated who still practice open defecation very regularly.

328
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:08,959
So a pit is like the best option, but a lot of users don't use them.

329
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:20,240
Still, culturally, it's not the norm, especially in places that have a ton of space, are very, very rural or are nomadic,

330
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,060
coming from like hunter gatherer traditions of where you actually defecate,

331
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:32,659
they view it as much safer just to go to a specific place, defecate there and then go back to the village and stuff.

332
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:38,750
So huge push. There's a huge push globally to try and end open defecation.

333
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:44,350
Famously, India has declared itself open, defecation free.

334
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:49,790
That was a huge, huge campaign that they pushed for in other countries.

335
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:59,810
Nepal me, I don't I guess I just heard presentation. So it's, it's viewed as this really harmful practice, but it's very common worldwide.

336
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:05,810
And I don't think I don't think it's all that well understood either exactly what risks that pose, because I don't think people.

337
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:14,320
The practice of open defecation can mean very different things in some places that are like us versus one like.

338
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:20,310
People really don't have options other than like an alleyway where other people are going to come into contact.

339
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:27,240
That's dangerous, but they don't have good options in very rural places where there really is a huge amount of space.

340
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:32,340
Sometimes I feel like the push for sanitation behavior is a little.

341
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:37,430
Imposing of cultural norms. Okay.

342
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:44,590
So again, we're talking about transmission pathways and how they're different in different contexts.

343
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:55,390
We talked about the introduction of infected feces into the world and now we can talk about how it's transmitted once it is there,

344
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:58,600
which again is very different depending on where you are in the world.

345
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:09,100
So one way that we just talked about is pits, for example, are leaking into groundwater.

346
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:18,150
Then if a well is located close by and has to be pretty close, then the water within that well can become contaminated as well.

347
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:22,880
People who fill it up for drinking water can come into contact with those pathogens.

348
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:27,370
And usually groundwater is naturally filtered.

349
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:34,300
The dirt sand that it travels through just naturally acts as filtration.

350
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:38,320
And so if you're pulling, well, water, for the most part, it's almost always clean.

351
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:43,990
You might get chemicals. Arsenic is a common one in certain areas.

352
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:47,260
But pathogen wise, it's actually very safe.

353
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:56,590
And that's one of the reasons that building wells in places that don't have clean water sources is a huge, like nonprofit industry.

354
00:42:58,270 --> 00:43:02,650
But it's also very difficult sometimes to get all the way down into the groundwater table.

355
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:09,280
But if a pit is located nearby and it's something like people are trying to figure that out,

356
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:15,609
maybe like 60 meters, a hundred meters, the filtration can be insufficient over that space.

357
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:20,020
So that water getting into the groundwater or into the well is not safe.

358
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:31,500
So in addition, we already talked about how on in a lot of places waste is just either not collected or not treated.

359
00:43:31,830 --> 00:43:40,350
And those areas where the waste is collected is either collected without treatment or wherever it's just left.

360
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:48,930
Serves as a point source of exposure in a lot of communities. So again, if you're dumping waste right into a body of water,

361
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:56,280
if that water body is serving as drinking water for someone, then that's a potential source of exposure.

362
00:43:58,350 --> 00:44:02,400
Swimming in it. Laundry, any any contact or just a.

363
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:11,870
Spread through animals, things like that, and an example of a site where open defecation might occur and.

364
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:20,629
Can just be a point source exposure for people that is brought into the community or spread by people.

365
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:29,450
So if for if you go to an area where other people up and defecate to do the same again diagram, you're bringing something back on your feet.

366
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:35,980
If you had to touch anything, you bring them back on your fingers. And very commonly we have the phantom problem.

367
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:41,040
This is something that's not fully fleshed out.

368
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:45,650
Research is really focusing on trying to understand the animal component of this.

369
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:49,490
Historically, they've been kind of left out of the equation.

370
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:57,860
More and more attention is coming on to the fact that the zoonotic aspects of fecal oral pathogens is probably very important,

371
00:44:57,860 --> 00:45:09,090
and we just don't know much about it really at all. So looking at the diagram in these settings where waste is just can be anywhere,

372
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:17,790
you see that all of these different pathways are potentially in play and many more that we could

373
00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:26,280
add to this once waste is just is left in the environment or is transmitted into the environment,

374
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:30,060
it's everywhere. It's being spread by really anything you do.

375
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:40,120
So moving on back to the idea of what's going on in high income countries, wealthy countries,

376
00:45:41,890 --> 00:45:51,310
one of the main ways that the exposure step can occur is if there are failures in those treatment plans.

377
00:45:51,550 --> 00:45:54,820
Generally, we're doing a good job, we have massive infrastructure,

378
00:45:54,820 --> 00:46:01,210
but sometimes that goes wrong and it's not that uncommon on a large scale, although in any given town it's very uncommon.

379
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:05,500
So sometimes it's just a mechanical failure like that.

380
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:11,010
Cryptosporidium outbreak happened in Milwaukee. They think a person made a mistake within the plant.

381
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:15,940
I don't know what they did, but made some user error that led to a huge problem.

382
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:25,319
We just had a different some news story recently from the Northeast, like Maine or something,

383
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:32,070
Vermont, some water operator just like started decided to lower the fluoride levels in the water.

384
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:37,469
I thought it was chlorine for a second, which would have been directly related, but same kind of thing.

385
00:46:37,470 --> 00:46:42,510
People, humans are in charge of these things and can sometimes make mistakes or make poor decisions.

386
00:46:43,650 --> 00:46:47,160
Other times it's just natural. So in this case.

387
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:58,379
Flooding led to a failure at the treatment plant, and that's at the water treatment plant, which is interesting.

388
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:02,640
Normally it happens at wastewater treatment plants. They can only handle so much water.

389
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:07,170
You have to you can build the biggest plant in the world to handle an unlimited amount.

390
00:47:07,170 --> 00:47:10,470
But generally you're planning for the actual community. And so if you're.

391
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:20,580
If you are used to and you build a plant for a certain amount of inflow that you want to treat and floods occur or heavy rains occur,

392
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:25,930
the plant can handle everything that's coming in. And so it just has to let some of the water through.

393
00:47:26,370 --> 00:47:29,070
It can't treat everything that's coming in. Some of it's going untreated.

394
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:33,900
And that's when you get like boil water advisories and communities after floods and stuff.

395
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:40,390
And another example from my home state was during the winter storms in Texas.

396
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:49,749
I don't remember exactly if it was just because of the power outages directly or if there were additional mechanical failures at the plants.

397
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:54,399
But my family had to was under boil water advisory for a while,

398
00:47:54,400 --> 00:48:01,720
which was really terrible for everyone with electric stoves because they couldn't boil the water because that was up.

399
00:48:02,050 --> 00:48:05,350
So these these things do happen.

400
00:48:05,470 --> 00:48:09,400
They're just rare and it's very catastrophic, very crisis mode when it does.

401
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:20,530
In a more silly note. Exposure is also very common in recreational waters, mostly in the summer.

402
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:31,270
And. Mostly at hotels. Apparently, like 30% of these illnesses are spread at hotels.

403
00:48:31,570 --> 00:48:35,110
But a lot of people gathering in one body source.

404
00:48:35,110 --> 00:48:41,470
I know it's full of chlorine that's burning your eyes, but that's not always enough.

405
00:48:42,070 --> 00:48:51,219
You need contact time for disinfection to occur. And so when you're crowding into a hot tub like this or a pool like this, it's crazy.

406
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:55,860
Like. This far into overtime specific shows like this.

407
00:48:56,310 --> 00:49:00,870
Did I ever do that? So yeah.

408
00:49:00,870 --> 00:49:07,560
People who are sick often can infect the entire water source and outbreaks do occur this way.

409
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:16,510
And also everyone swallows a good bit of water when you're swimming, maybe more than you might realize.

410
00:49:16,530 --> 00:49:21,420
So that's how it occurs. It's just like a known amount of water that people swallow when they swim.

411
00:49:23,370 --> 00:49:30,840
Chris. So in addition, it's not uncommon to have sporadic food borne outbreaks in wealthy countries.

412
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:40,120
This is a current one I pulled up. So if you bought traditional falafel from Aldi, you might want to check the Internet.

413
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:45,810
Cool. Thing is, they can tell you exactly like the barcodes or like the numbers,

414
00:49:46,170 --> 00:49:51,010
the serial numbers on your package so that, you know, if it's recalled or not and.

415
00:49:52,040 --> 00:50:02,059
And so this happens. But the main point, I would say is that it's very well tracked in the U.S. at least,

416
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:09,950
and probably in some other countries that are somewhat they can tell you exactly how many people have been tracked as ill,

417
00:50:10,130 --> 00:50:14,270
their whole teams that are investigating it. They can again tell you like the serial number.

418
00:50:15,170 --> 00:50:21,650
We have a very robust food testing system and reporting system, recall system and.

419
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:32,340
This is so it's somewhat common here in the U.S., but it's probably foodborne outbreaks, probably much more common everywhere in the world.

420
00:50:32,550 --> 00:50:39,180
But they don't have the robust food systems, food testing systems, lab systems to actually know anything about those and track them.

421
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:50,880
In addition to like sporadic outbreaks, foodborne illnesses are kind of endemic and they just happen all the time.

422
00:50:51,390 --> 00:50:54,470
So. Annually.

423
00:50:55,100 --> 00:51:06,950
In the US there's something like 48 million illnesses from food borne diseases every year, which was so much higher than I thought.

424
00:51:07,550 --> 00:51:14,900
But and these don't necessarily mean that people were hospitalized or even particularly sick, just got something from food.

425
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:19,130
So it's very common food. Pathogens are very common.

426
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:26,610
And. Looking at what that actually comes from.

427
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:33,660
Most of most foodborne illnesses are spread from produce that's contaminated.

428
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:39,120
Does anyone know in particular what the highest risk category of produces?

429
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:48,450
Leafy vegetables, salad, but as anything leafy, just.

430
00:51:48,690 --> 00:51:56,489
Mostly, I think because it has so many places for them to hide and they're not washed very thoroughly or often aren't early.

431
00:51:56,490 --> 00:52:00,990
But instead of something like a melon that just has one outer thing,

432
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:08,460
it's full of folds and things and a anywhere within that equal I can hide and it's friends.

433
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:15,420
So sporadic foodborne outbreaks but also they're happening all the time here.

434
00:52:15,690 --> 00:52:26,340
These are some of the ways that in wealthier countries we're exposed to pathogens that generally are collected, but sometimes they're failures.

435
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:37,220
Coming up. Oh, this is like 30 minutes ahead, which is terrifying.

436
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:42,910
Intervention. So what can we actually do to prevent this from happening?

437
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:49,450
I want to point out that this generally comes to water, sanitation and hygiene, which is a whole field.

438
00:52:49,450 --> 00:52:55,720
So this is kind of my fields. I sometimes think of myself as as a wash researcher.

439
00:52:55,930 --> 00:53:00,489
Sometimes I don't. But it's a huge thing. Like you can get jobs in wash.

440
00:53:00,490 --> 00:53:05,380
It's a sector. Non-profits have a wash division. Huge.

441
00:53:06,890 --> 00:53:11,360
Nonprofit government, international aid sector.

442
00:53:13,670 --> 00:53:25,880
Okay. So back to our favorite diagram as to looking at where we can do interventions.

443
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:35,450
The first we've talked about is adequate sanitation, which we call a primary barrier because it cuts off contamination at the source.

444
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:40,399
And so almost all of these arrows that are coming off of the feces itself can be

445
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:44,030
blocked with sanitation because we're just never letting it get out into the world.

446
00:53:44,030 --> 00:53:47,300
We're just collecting it right away. We're going to put it in the sewer.

447
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:54,860
It's going to be transmitted underground all the way to Lake Huron, Huron River, Huron.

448
00:53:56,510 --> 00:54:04,760
And it's just not something we have to deal with. So the actual interventions are just sanitation systems here.

449
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:09,080
It's the sewerage, wastewater treatment and in some places, latrines.

450
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:15,800
But something that we traditionally there's been a ton of focus.

451
00:54:17,450 --> 00:54:21,620
Let me say first, interventions is what we tend to think of as what you do in other places.

452
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:25,699
Like our toilets aren't interventions. We've just we have toilets.

453
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:31,999
We've always had toilets in some places. If a place needs an intervention, they don't have the culture around something.

454
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:36,080
They don't have the money to have developed it themselves.

455
00:54:36,230 --> 00:54:39,530
So someone needs to come in and intervene.

456
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:47,270
Lots of air quotes and and traditionally I think because of that system,

457
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:58,820
we have really focused interventions on hardware like building latrines and putting them in and then leaving and that's it.

458
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:08,330
Good job. But part of my research has been looking at how effective those sanitation interventions actually are and in general answers.

459
00:55:08,330 --> 00:55:14,150
They're not they're latrine interventions almost never actually do anything to prevent diarrheal disease,

460
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:19,820
despite the fact that it's a multi-million billion dollar industry.

461
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:26,980
They just aren't. As they're probably too hardware focused.

462
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:35,410
So there's increasing attention now on the fact that you really need an entire sanitation system for pit latrines.

463
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:40,930
They eventually fill up and sometimes you can just cover it and move to another one, but eventually you run out of space.

464
00:55:41,170 --> 00:55:46,750
So it's much more common to actually empty the pit and someone has to do that.

465
00:55:47,050 --> 00:55:54,430
So someone has to be employed as a pit, emptier. And in many places where people just come in and build one, no one's doing that job.

466
00:55:54,670 --> 00:56:00,400
So when the pits for that's it. The latrine is now defunct and no one uses it anymore.

467
00:56:02,990 --> 00:56:07,399
In other cases where waste might be collected, the treatment step can be missing.

468
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:17,059
And wastewater treatment is are these massive plants like we have or hopefully don't require that, but require a good bit of attention.

469
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:23,750
And that's part of the sanitation system that has to be really complete from beginning to end to actually affect disease.

470
00:56:24,710 --> 00:56:27,790
So that's something that is getting increasing attention.

471
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:34,310
We're moving away from just hardware into actually thinking of sanitation systems writ large.

472
00:56:35,470 --> 00:56:43,870
So another thing to point out is that behavior change is a problem in many ways, but that's the focus of a lot of interventions,

473
00:56:44,110 --> 00:56:50,920
including a lot of those very ineffective interventions go to places that just don't have norms,

474
00:56:50,950 --> 00:56:54,700
cultural norms around sanitation, where like latrines are what they do.

475
00:56:55,060 --> 00:57:04,480
And so a lot of interventions, a lot of the global apparatus of sanitation is geared towards behavior change and trying to get people

476
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:12,400
invested in the idea of sanitation versus knowledge of the fact that it's important and then build the norms.

477
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:16,090
One problem is that that's been done in some really gross ways.

478
00:57:16,930 --> 00:57:21,879
One of the most I don't know if it's all that common, and I don't know the history of it fully.

479
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:30,790
But one of the biggest intervention types was is community led, total sanitation.

480
00:57:31,270 --> 00:57:40,420
And it it's very involved. It has a lot of meetings and a lot of events and things geared towards creating those cultural norms.

481
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:46,600
But it usually starts with what was what used to be called a shame walk,

482
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:53,739
where they would gather people in the village to just like walk through it together and point out all the open defecation,

483
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:59,740
like piles of feces and things, and really rile up the fact that it was shameful and they should feel bad about it.

484
00:58:01,150 --> 00:58:09,850
And in some places led to problems where like violence eventually broke out from the people who were really on board with shaming,

485
00:58:09,850 --> 00:58:16,160
the people who were like, Leave me alone. So that's one problem with behavior change.

486
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:21,560
Another problem is that it's really hard to do. That's definitely far from my expertise, but.

487
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:33,240
It's very complicated. I think dealing with cultural norms in general and creating them seems to be something that we're just not very good at yet.

488
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:41,280
Not that we necessarily have to be, but balancing that with the fact that 400,000 plus children are dying every

489
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:45,650
year is admittedly a bigger challenge than I can ever really think through.

490
00:58:47,770 --> 00:58:56,829
Okay. So moving on. So adequate sanitation can be a primary barrier cutting off, but inadequate sanitation,

491
00:58:56,830 --> 00:59:02,530
like those leeching pit latrines or no one's there to empty it or nobody's treating it.

492
00:59:02,530 --> 00:59:09,700
At the end it's collected with water. Then it's just a porous barrier and contamination can go through.

493
00:59:12,550 --> 00:59:16,020
Another intervention is hand hygiene and.

494
00:59:19,690 --> 00:59:21,010
Sanitation is a primary area.

495
00:59:21,610 --> 00:59:29,650
Hand hygiene is a secondary barrier because it is preventing some of those pathways, but not just the whole thing from upstream.

496
00:59:30,670 --> 00:59:36,760
So it is spreading. Preventing spread by hands, fingers specifically.

497
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:46,450
If you're washing your hands thoroughly after defecating, then your fingers are no longer carrying pathogens that can be spread.

498
00:59:46,930 --> 00:59:53,290
And so on the F diagram, that pathway is covered along with some of the pathways that.

499
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:07,219
Are better going through food. So if you're washing your hands before handling food, preventing cross-contamination of things,

500
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:14,810
then you can prevent a lot of those foodborne illnesses that are common. So this kind of looks the same everywhere.

501
01:00:15,350 --> 01:00:18,530
It's about behavior change to an extent.

502
01:00:18,530 --> 01:00:26,370
And so you can see like probably in most of the bathrooms here, there's probably a sign that says stop the flu or count to 20.

503
01:00:26,390 --> 01:00:31,220
Happy birthday, sing happy birthday. Not happy birthday to you specifically.

504
01:00:33,170 --> 01:00:37,819
And it's the same in like lower income countries. It's usually malls more like community things.

505
01:00:37,820 --> 01:00:41,780
If the norm isn't there, like here, we might just need to be reminded and triggered to do it.

506
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:49,759
In some places that's just not a norm. And so they try to foster that, but you also need the things to do it and so access to.

507
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:54,739
So that's an intervention in many places. It's not just in the public bathroom.

508
01:00:54,740 --> 01:01:01,399
And so you're providing soap to families. You also need access to clean water, though, and that's a big problem with hand hygiene.

509
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:10,520
Is that another historical problem with Wash is that it has been kind of siloed in water, sanitation, hygiene as like separate things.

510
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:15,380
And you can go do one but not the other. But a lot of sanitation options need water to flush.

511
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:19,160
Hand hygiene very specifically needs clean water to wash with.

512
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:26,930
And so another growing thing is that there's more emphasis on doing the whole wash system.

513
01:01:30,470 --> 01:01:41,150
Lastly, water treatment is a secondary barrier that prevents ingestion of waterborne pathogens, and so it is impacting just one small pathway.

514
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:45,440
But this is like a very dominant pathway.

515
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:49,220
And so you get a lot of bang for your buck if you're treating water.

516
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:58,180
And it's kind of like the philosophical difference of between sanitation and water use at the end.

517
01:01:58,220 --> 01:02:03,860
Like you can just like deal with the reality that you have and the water is what it is, let's treat it and then everything's fine.

518
01:02:05,390 --> 01:02:09,170
And that can be very cost effective. It can be very simple and it can just get the job done.

519
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:15,620
But that's not addressing upstream problems that sanitation is more geared towards.

520
01:02:16,330 --> 01:02:24,890
And so there's different strategies, different places might need different things sometimes on the water and sometimes further upstream.

521
01:02:26,260 --> 01:02:30,760
So looking a little closer at what water treatment interventions look like.

522
01:02:31,910 --> 01:02:39,560
Again. And these we saw how sanitation is very different in high income versus low income settings.

523
01:02:39,860 --> 01:02:44,180
And hygiene similar, but looks very different. Similar principle looks very different.

524
01:02:44,390 --> 01:02:47,840
And water treatment also very, very different.

525
01:02:48,350 --> 01:02:58,040
So in settings like the US, municipal water treatment can keep drinking water very safe but at very high costs.

526
01:02:59,540 --> 01:03:02,990
I pulled these numbers from the Ann Arbor budget.

527
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:09,410
Hopefully I understood what they meant, but I don't like put me on the news, please.

528
01:03:09,410 --> 01:03:19,070
But the annual costs for fiscal year 2022 to for water treatment in Ann Arbor was 848,000.

529
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:29,930
And in the same over time, Ann Arbor has constructed a an ultraviolet disinfection system that cost $4 million.

530
01:03:30,260 --> 01:03:36,770
I have no clue what the treatment plant itself cost to build, but it was millions of dollars for sure.

531
01:03:37,310 --> 01:03:41,260
And I don't know, I haven't been to a water treatment plant. They're really fun to tour.

532
01:03:41,270 --> 01:03:46,850
I recommend it. This again, these are both from Ann Arbor. This is up on Water Hill.

533
01:03:47,510 --> 01:03:52,520
And it I used to live up there. Great. Great place to tour.

534
01:03:54,110 --> 01:04:00,200
They're very they take a lot of infrastructure. They're huge take tons of materials.

535
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:05,179
And in the U.S. particular can be very high tech.

536
01:04:05,180 --> 01:04:08,300
And so I don't know what any of this stuff is. Maybe it's all for show.

537
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:09,920
But in general,

538
01:04:10,340 --> 01:04:19,460
our treatment plants can have a lot of sensors that are being very much that are very meticulously tracking water quality water levels,

539
01:04:19,700 --> 01:04:28,250
very electronic giving real time information, adding disinfectants at different rates depending on how much water is there, how dirty it is.

540
01:04:28,610 --> 01:04:39,670
It can be very expensive to do it to the. To the extent that we do here so briefly, this is what the water treatment process looks like.

541
01:04:41,190 --> 01:04:44,730
It's really simple. You intake water.

542
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:49,989
Coagulation is a way of getting all like big stuff out.

543
01:04:49,990 --> 01:04:59,680
You can just like spin it or put some material in the water that creates clumps of just yucky gunk that you want out.

544
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:08,770
Then sedimentation. You usually spin the water slowly so that all the solids just slowly sink to the bottom.

545
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:12,130
And then you have water by itself.

546
01:05:12,610 --> 01:05:21,530
Filter it, disinfect it, distribute. The disinfection step is there are tons of options for how you actually disinfect water.

547
01:05:21,950 --> 01:05:32,030
In the US and most common use chlorine. And so sometimes a city water source can taste kind of chlorinated.

548
01:05:32,690 --> 01:05:37,099
In Europe, it's apparently more common to use ozone. And I don't I'm no engineer.

549
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:42,620
I don't know the actual difference in how those work, but it's pointing out that there are different ways of disinfecting.

550
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:54,170
And one option. And since I learned Ann Arbor does both after chlorination sometimes you do ultraviolet radiation to further disinfect our.

551
01:05:56,440 --> 01:06:04,380
Go. So that's the high income spectrum in lower wealth settings.

552
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:10,830
There are low cost water treatment options, but one of the main problems that they put the burden on the consumer.

553
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:14,790
And again, this is kind of a reality of how do you intervene?

554
01:06:16,050 --> 01:06:21,540
On a problem that's happening all the time when it needs a system that takes a long time to develop.

555
01:06:23,390 --> 01:06:29,180
The most common way of disinfecting use in low income settings is boiling.

556
01:06:31,010 --> 01:06:36,860
But that's not always an option and takes fuel source and takes time takes a good

557
01:06:36,860 --> 01:06:44,440
while to well water chlorination is also an option and there are lots of like.

558
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:54,310
Like companies that create like chlorine tablets,

559
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:59,950
powders and things that you can have in your household that are used as interventions across the world.

560
01:06:59,950 --> 01:07:05,710
So that might just have a box of chlorine tablets that, you know, you need to put into your water before you drink it.

561
01:07:07,390 --> 01:07:11,140
Fluctuation powder is another similar thing.

562
01:07:12,070 --> 01:07:18,250
I don't think it's very common, but it's a powder that creates clumps out of all the stuff that you don't want in the water.

563
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:23,440
So we put it in and shake it up. Eventually, let all that stuff settle out onto the powder.

564
01:07:24,620 --> 01:07:34,309
Filtration is very common, but you can use ceramics and sand and a lot of people use cloth, which is not an effective filtration method.

565
01:07:34,310 --> 01:07:41,240
So this is an example of something that people think very commonly think is making their water safe,

566
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:49,780
but in reality, it just isn't getting the job done. And solar disinfection, which is what the picture is, I was fascinated by,

567
01:07:49,790 --> 01:07:56,029
saw that this actually works because sun does not feel to disinfect me when I'm in it.

568
01:07:56,030 --> 01:08:02,630
But if you leave water in clear bottles out long enough, then they will eventually be disinfected and it works pretty well.

569
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:11,900
So again, this is like a huge intervention nonprofit industry that exists.

570
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:16,800
And there are. A lot of difference.

571
01:08:17,220 --> 01:08:28,950
There's a lot of focus on like creating new technologies and things that are going to work on this end user stage instead of on the system side,

572
01:08:28,950 --> 01:08:36,930
creating robust water systems. People want that, of course, but where can you interview this question?

573
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:42,100
And I another example within that there are life straws.

574
01:08:42,130 --> 01:08:49,750
They are familiar with life straws like straw seem great for camping, but when I saw them as like an intervention.

575
01:08:50,910 --> 01:08:54,390
I saw pictures of like handing them out in some village somewhere.

576
01:08:54,540 --> 01:09:00,240
And that was an example of something that I think is hard to grapple with, I guess.

577
01:09:00,540 --> 01:09:06,329
My name says GROSS. I don't know that it's gross. People are trying to do what they can to prevent disease.

578
01:09:06,330 --> 01:09:12,410
And so they're like, That's great, but. That's not enough.

579
01:09:12,430 --> 01:09:20,020
That's not what we really need. We need more resource sharing, more robust systems, ways of getting the actual problem addressed.

580
01:09:23,380 --> 01:09:34,890
All right. So. Those are the interventions that I tend to think of in Wash and how they're different depending on where you live and by income.

581
01:09:35,340 --> 01:09:46,440
But to end the time, I wanted to point out some exceptions to those regional patterns,

582
01:09:47,610 --> 01:09:51,809
because I painted a really broad brush on what happens in wealthy countries,

583
01:09:51,810 --> 01:09:55,139
in low income countries, and that's obviously wrong in a lot of ways,

584
01:09:55,140 --> 01:10:00,420
but hopefully just helps you get an idea of what some of the regional patterns are.

585
01:10:00,630 --> 01:10:03,840
But there are exceptions. I don't think I'll have time to go through everything.

586
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:09,520
Like how. But first I hopefully this works.

587
01:10:09,540 --> 01:10:13,130
I didn't think to ask. You should.

588
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:22,260
Should just work. Should just work. Minority ethnic groups within countries face poor water and sanitation access.

589
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:27,810
We that's the main takeaway of this last section.

590
01:10:29,730 --> 01:10:37,760
I just need to stop being on a laser pointer. Don't.

591
01:10:45,110 --> 01:10:53,360
Catherine Flowers was born. County, Alabama, officials say.

592
01:10:55,120 --> 01:11:01,030
She me? It's for proper sanitation in the air.

593
01:11:02,190 --> 01:11:05,180
Okay. Okay. So this is Catherine Flowers.

594
01:11:05,190 --> 01:11:19,110
She's an advocate and a lawyer who has brought a lot of attention to poor access to sanitation among rural residents of Alabama.

595
01:11:19,290 --> 01:11:24,569
And with various teams, she has extended the work to throughout the South.

596
01:11:24,570 --> 01:11:30,120
And I think it probably applies really much more broadly than that,

597
01:11:30,330 --> 01:11:35,520
but has brought a lot of attention to the fact that even though we're in very wealthy United States,

598
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:41,910
there are communities that are totally left out of sanitation, progress, essentially.

599
01:11:42,150 --> 01:11:47,460
So let's have this about how flowers was born in Lowndes County, Alabama.

600
01:11:47,850 --> 01:11:54,989
Now she advocates for proper sanitation in the area to prevent the spread of diseases like this.

601
01:11:54,990 --> 01:11:57,660
All too great for farming the whole world.

602
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:09,810
And because they hold water very bad for treatment of wastewater, installing a subject here is more difficult than elsewhere.

603
01:12:09,990 --> 01:12:16,110
It's very complicated because when they break down, gravity pushes the water back into the home.

604
01:12:16,380 --> 01:12:20,400
So people have to deal with raw sewage in their homes.

605
01:12:20,490 --> 01:12:23,400
People have to deal with raw sewage in their bathtubs.

606
01:12:23,810 --> 01:12:32,580
And then going into a home where you see the light along the wall and the sewage being came back into the home, that it was full of raw sewage.

607
01:12:34,020 --> 01:12:37,950
And the people that live there had tried to clean it.

608
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:47,040
And those of us from the outside can still smell it. How much does it cost to install a septic system in most areas in a place like where we are now?

609
01:12:47,850 --> 01:12:54,990
They're going to need an engineer system. They can be anywhere between $16,000 upwards.

610
01:12:56,460 --> 01:13:01,350
And a lot of people are living in homes that are not one symptom of a system that was in them.

611
01:13:03,030 --> 01:13:09,810
So it doesn't make sense. We did a House to House survey and we did a survey.

612
01:13:10,380 --> 01:13:17,480
Over half of the households that we visited either had failing systems or they received.

613
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:29,250
I mean, this is over to over 2000 homes in there, about 5200 homes, according to the Census Bureau, once again.

614
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:32,760
So you get the results back from the study.

615
01:13:33,410 --> 01:13:36,930
And and then what what did you expect to see happening?

616
01:13:37,290 --> 01:13:41,670
I expected someone to see the connection between real sewerage and homes.

617
01:13:42,750 --> 01:13:51,840
And I expect that there would be some kind of commission that would be put together in this state to really address this problem.

618
01:13:52,260 --> 01:13:55,290
And did the package what can you tell me?

619
01:13:56,550 --> 01:14:00,540
What was the racial makeup of the participants? They were all in there.

620
01:14:01,140 --> 01:14:05,160
Everybody was one. Yes. Okay. So let me ask you this.

621
01:14:05,700 --> 01:14:10,200
Do you think the Alabama Department of Health would have reacted differently if the participants were white?

622
01:14:10,470 --> 01:14:14,230
Yes, I think they would have reacted differently.

623
01:14:14,250 --> 01:14:17,100
The participants were more. How different?

624
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:27,870
I think I would have found Lenny White a way to address it in remediating the problems with onsite septic systems.

625
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:33,240
I think there would have been more activity on the policy level to address.

626
01:14:33,970 --> 01:14:41,530
Yeah. I mean even this they have their work on himself in the interviews that the you know,

627
01:14:41,530 --> 01:14:46,270
the people with the influence get the help and the people without it.

628
01:14:47,170 --> 01:14:50,400
And in this case, the people without influence are more likely.

629
01:14:55,840 --> 01:15:03,550
So that's in rural Alabama, and it's a black belt where the soil is historically.

630
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:07,970
Incredible for agriculture. It's like a strip.

631
01:15:08,150 --> 01:15:15,380
Then the center of Alabama, which, as you mention, makes it hard to put in or expensive to put in septic tank systems.

632
01:15:15,620 --> 01:15:20,690
And so for these rural residents, they don't have other they don't have options, really.

633
01:15:21,860 --> 01:15:28,790
As you mentioned, the cost to install ones can be more expensive than that house people live in is worth.

634
01:15:30,850 --> 01:15:37,300
And despite bringing a report to the government pointing out the issue, no action was taken.

635
01:15:37,310 --> 01:15:44,390
I don't know if it's been updated since then. She also mentioned that a lot of people rely on straight piping, which is.

636
01:15:46,250 --> 01:15:49,400
Just no collection of waste. So same thing.

637
01:15:49,430 --> 01:15:56,240
Some of those pictures showed from various other countries just putting it into the yard somewhere,

638
01:15:56,420 --> 01:16:00,920
hopefully as far away from the house as they can manage, but kind of just flooding it with waste.

639
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:04,400
So usually flush stuff from a toilet and then just out into the environment.

640
01:16:06,830 --> 01:16:10,309
Obviously looking at the diagram in this infectious disease,

641
01:16:10,310 --> 01:16:18,680
every class poses health risks and hookworm is something that they specifically measured in the study.

642
01:16:20,610 --> 01:16:27,180
Which. Is like a Great Depression era disease in the U.S.

643
01:16:27,210 --> 01:16:31,320
There are like really old studies on hookworm in rural Georgia and stuff.

644
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:39,390
But I, I assume common wisdom would have been 15 years ago that we didn't have hookworm or something.

645
01:16:39,810 --> 01:16:49,500
Maybe not 100%, but I think this is the kind of thing that people have been able to ignore because of.

646
01:16:50,570 --> 01:16:57,520
And overall national. Idea of what we have access to and what sanitation, what water looks like here.

647
01:16:59,650 --> 01:17:04,930
Like a stereotype essentially of what it is. And data has kind of supported that.

648
01:17:04,930 --> 01:17:11,560
There's a whole organization that works with W.H.O. and UNICEF that tracks access to water and sanitation in various countries.

649
01:17:13,330 --> 01:17:19,930
And it started in 1960, something for water and then 73 for sanitation.

650
01:17:20,380 --> 01:17:30,430
And until the year 2000, the titles of those reports were the first ones were water and sanitation in the developing countries,

651
01:17:30,430 --> 01:17:35,379
which is hilariously dated just the developing countries.

652
01:17:35,380 --> 01:17:44,650
And until the year 2000, they only measured access in four regions Latin American, Caribbean, sub-Saharan Africa,

653
01:17:44,650 --> 01:17:51,040
Asia and some maybe another, maybe the Southeast Asia and South Asia or something, I'm not sure.

654
01:17:51,730 --> 01:17:58,360
But for the longest time they didn't even bother measuring access in in high income countries, developed countries, as they would have called it.

655
01:17:58,720 --> 01:18:09,450
I'm really over doing the air quotes today. And so even then in reports that were like very recent, like in the 20 tens,

656
01:18:09,450 --> 01:18:18,269
probably the US and UK, other similar high income countries had just 100% on all their things.

657
01:18:18,270 --> 01:18:23,640
And it really seemed to just be like an assumption more than anything that was tracked in any meaningful way.

658
01:18:25,050 --> 01:18:30,120
The reality and a lot of people are starting to pay more attention to this is that that's just not true.

659
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:35,490
And there's a lot more heterogeneity in access than we've ever given credit.

660
01:18:39,340 --> 01:18:47,370
Okay. I'll be real quick on this case study, which I put in because it's topical to this.

661
01:18:47,370 --> 01:18:51,390
But also this is my research that I did with Dr. Eisenberg.

662
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:55,530
So I kind of want to show you students, this is part of my research.

663
01:18:57,240 --> 01:19:04,920
So you like what research in this field looks like? It might be in action and can be so.

664
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:14,160
This is another example of a minority ethnic group in every country that faces poor access to water and sanitation.

665
01:19:15,300 --> 01:19:20,100
And these it's really just the Bedouin people of southern Israel.

666
01:19:20,730 --> 01:19:30,510
The Bedouin are an Arab ethnic group who have long lived in the desert regions of the Middle East and northern Africa,

667
01:19:30,750 --> 01:19:34,140
including population in the Negev Desert,

668
01:19:34,470 --> 01:19:41,490
which is now modern day Israel and the Bedouin have long historically lived in nomadic

669
01:19:41,490 --> 01:19:47,460
tribes that migrated with herds of cattle and sheep and goats for water grazing.

670
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:57,920
And due to their nomadic culture, they the empires that ruled over the lands occupied by better.
