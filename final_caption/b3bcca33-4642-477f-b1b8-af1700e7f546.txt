1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:09,600
Let's turn that on. So this is kind of just a small little detail, but I think it will help you do the rest of the homework.

2
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:17,009
Okay. So I'm just going to walk through this. So I just pulled some random numbers.

3
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:22,580
But these numbers have should be pretty similar to what you had in your problem for problem number one.

4
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:27,440
So you have the blood concentration and the time. Right. So if we can all see that.

5
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:32,060
Okay. No, no, no. Let's be clear.

6
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:49,080
Sorry about. So if people going.

7
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:04,930
Okay. So for those that just came in, the guest lecture ended up just found out she was sick.

8
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:11,920
So she's going to be coming in. What we're going to do is see if we can get her to record it as a Zoom lecture and then post to the website.

9
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:19,479
So we'll still be able to get to that material. I'm not going to put any material that was not covered in class under the exam,

10
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:23,170
so don't worry about that if we don't get it up in time and then we'll give you

11
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:26,739
enough time to be able to watch that lecture if we expect it to be on the exam.

12
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:39,130
But if like going to be an exemplar. So then the, so what I'm going to do just for this class is go over a kind of a one of the go to problem one.

13
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:42,549
Something I think based on office hours might have been tripping people up a little

14
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:48,520
bit and then turn people loose to go work on the problem set for this class period.

15
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,980
I'll open I'll I'll set up a small office hours window after we leave here.

16
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:59,380
If someone wants to come by and talk to me during that time.

17
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:03,370
So that makes sense. Okay.

18
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:07,080
So now you can see this. Maybe I can zoom in a little bit.

19
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:12,520
So this is like with this should look similar to problem one right here given times

20
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:18,729
after an I.V. bolus injection with a compound and then you have concentrations.

21
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:23,260
And again, these are just hypothetical numbers I just pulled out of here. So you'll have your own numbers.

22
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:26,370
I didn't want to use the exact same numbers from the problem. Okay.

23
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:29,270
And so the first thing you want to do, I believe,

24
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:37,299
like the first question that's ask is something about the initial concentration or you want to find the initial concentration or the K constant.

25
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:41,290
So what you want to do here. So in Excel I use Excel.

26
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:44,770
If you want to use something else, that's totally fine. But.

27
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:53,480
You just highlight these numbers and then go to insert and then go over to recommended charts,

28
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,120
charts, and you're going to see a curve and that's a curve fitting the data, right?

29
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:07,999
And then what we want to do is essentially draw a curve like model a curve through those data points that you're given.

30
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,460
And so the software is going to fit some kind of curve, a best fit curve through those data points.

31
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:18,380
And so you'll go up here to add chart element, go down the trend line.

32
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:24,470
Does this look like a linear, linear curve or an exponential curve?

33
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,620
Actually exponential. So exponential.

34
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:34,940
So look at drew a curve through the points. Right. You see this dotted line here.

35
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:43,150
And so then what you can do is. Right click on the other trendline.

36
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:48,000
Go to format trendline. And then go to the display equation on the chart.

37
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:56,030
It's going to give you an equation. And that equation should look really similar to the one that you see in your slides.

38
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:03,120
So this format you've seen before, right? So this is concentration.

39
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,500
That's why it's tendency. And then initial concentration is given by this number.

40
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:13,110
And then you have your cake and your time.

41
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:20,730
So given all of those, that information you should be able to solve for the other numbers that are asked for throughout the rest of the problem.

42
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:27,419
So I wanted to go over that because I think it's the type of, you know, problem where if you get tripped up early on,

43
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:32,850
it might make it harder to do the following steps and get the other numbers that are asked for.

44
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:40,830
But I just wanted to kind of explicitly walk through that and make sure you all knew how to do that in Excel.

45
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:48,650
Does that make sense? So it's enough to like sure work just by like putting in that table and then just showing how you use that equation.

46
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:58,430
Yeah. Basically, yeah. If you if you if you were to say like copy and paste this curve into your homework, that's fine.

47
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:02,100
And just, you know. Um.

48
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:10,000
Yeah, so that was it. So I think that should give you, uh, pretty far just getting that first step.

49
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:13,659
Um, the other equations are somewhere on the slides.

50
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:17,170
Like if it's for half life, you should find that somewhere in your slides.

51
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:22,570
If it's for area under the curve, again, use that dose.

52
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:26,649
So I think in the a problem it's like 450 milligrams.

53
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:32,230
That's your dose that you use. That's your initial I.V. bolus dose that was used in the problem.

54
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:35,720
I think the thing that was tripping up some people,

55
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:43,960
I see why this might have been something that trip people up was they thought that 450 was actually the initial concentration at time zero.

56
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,320
But that is a mass, not a concentration.

57
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:57,520
So after we inject this mass into someone's blood, it's going to just distribute into the tissues, into the bloodstream, what have you.

58
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:06,160
And so you're going to get a mass per liter. The the the the mass is just the the that for 50 milligrams or whatever the

59
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,660
number was is just a mass of compound that we've injected into the individual.

60
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:15,300
So hopefully that makes sense. It clarifies a few things.

61
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:19,049
So I will still have office hours, probably.

62
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:26,850
I'll probably have a short office hours maybe after we leave here, and then another one at the regularly scheduled time, and then Thursday and Friday.

63
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:33,120
So if there's anything else that I can help with, they show up to that.

64
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:37,170
But I think that'll be it for this class period.

65
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:41,130
I'm sorry. I just found out this morning that she wouldn't be able to give the lecture.

66
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:47,790
She's really sorry that she couldn't make it. But her that she's got, like, throat issues and stuff,

67
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:55,769
and it just wouldn't be great to have someone sick in the room with us for an hour and 20 minutes.

68
00:06:55,770 --> 00:07:02,460
So, like I said, we'll we'll see about the mechanics of getting that lecture up on the website.

69
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:08,390
Seems like it should be very easy to do, but I don't want to promise anything that I haven't explicitly done yet.

70
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:14,430
So we're going to see about what we can do about that. Maybe it's something where I have to like send everyone a link to it and an email or something.

71
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:19,800
I don't really know, but we'll work on getting you that developmental tox lecture one way or the other.

72
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:25,310
So thanks so much. If anyone has any questions, come on down.

73
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:33,240
Otherwise, I'm going to head up to my office and open up a Zoom office hours for the rest of my career.

74
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:46,600
Thanks for showing up. Sorry. Like you.
