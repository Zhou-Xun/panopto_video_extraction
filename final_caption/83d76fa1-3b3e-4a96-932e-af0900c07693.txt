1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:11,299
Because we've got to make sure. Okay.

2
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:16,940
So let's start the day. Hi. This is nutritional epidemiology and amazing.

3
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,560
So today what we're going to do is some introductions.

4
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:27,770
I'll go over the syllabus to kind of like make sure that you understand the what the course is about and dispensations.

5
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:34,700
And I'll give you like a brief general overview of nutritional epidemiology so you know what you're getting into.

6
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:39,020
So that will be the first part of the class and hopefully will be short.

7
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:45,440
And then we will have I mean, nutritional epidemiology is a method class, right?

8
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:53,330
So we are going to apply learning methods to analyze nutrition data and then their analysis is getting to the princess.

9
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:59,419
So, so because I'm not sure about how is your SAS kind of like knowledge is not a requirement.

10
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:03,500
Some people will know SAS with no problems and people will feel a little rusty.

11
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:10,280
So then I have like this Dempster clinic. I send you on the USA, my announcement, an email.

12
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:16,600
Okay, good. So suggesting that you can kind of like check those recordings that I need for a basic setup.

13
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:22,640
So then that, that if you were checking the records and you felt kind of like, yeah, I can do that, then you should be fine.

14
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:29,000
I'll talk a little more about that thing. So again, you can leave that.

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,319
I mean, once we reach that point of reviewing SAS, you can.

16
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:36,650
I mean, you feel that I'm fine with SAS, then you can leave for today.

17
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:42,710
If not, you really feel that you can benefit from the refreshment days and maybe you can stay, of course.

18
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:51,670
And then not to myself. So don't forget to record. So I wonder if someone can reminds me every Friday please record I think is

19
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,910
that is someone who cannot make it so at least they can watch it in the car.

20
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:59,900
Okay, so thank you for this presentation.

21
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:04,310
Okay, so again, I'm an meeting, that's my email.

22
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:08,480
So I let me tell you a little bit about myself.

23
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:13,459
So I'm associate professor in Nutrition Sciences and epidemiology.

24
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:22,220
I'm a nutritional epidemiologist. And that's why I mean, to the parliament, I do research in, I mean, in many things,

25
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:28,610
but mostly nutrition and cardiometabolic risk sometimes in global settings.

26
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:32,450
I've been working in Latin America a lot, but also kind of like at the local level.

27
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:42,859
I also work with data from the U.S. I'm originally from Spain, so I'm not wearing my mask because if I wear my most,

28
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:46,969
you won't be able to understand me because I have a very strong accent.

29
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:51,890
I speak very quickly and I have a cellphone. So which is a recipe for disaster?

30
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:56,240
Anything that I'm wearing my mask, then you probably won't understand anything.

31
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:01,910
So please, please, please, please ask me to slow down, okay?

32
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:05,810
Because I tend to rebel and then no one understands anything, right?

33
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:09,170
I can do it if I'm kind of like it. Right.

34
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:12,720
So I can. Okay, breathe and slow down.

35
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:19,220
Okay. But most of the time I will go back to my default setting is speak too fast.

36
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:29,670
Okay, so, so the office hours for this class will be Friday 11, which I know is their worst moment of today.

37
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:35,510
Because, I mean, you have the the kind of like homework. So you at 1 p.m. every two weeks.

38
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,989
But I did it on purpose because I don't want you to leave it to the last moment.

39
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:42,850
Right? So then I want to make sure that you start working on your homework day.

40
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:49,069
You have to two weeks for each topic, so you have plenty of time, but then leave it to the last moment.

41
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:55,940
Okay. In any case, if someone cannot make it to office hours, then you can just send me an email and we can have an appointment.

42
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:02,899
So that will that will work. And you can email me anytime with specific questions.

43
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,860
I mean, it will be up to you to decide who you really need.

44
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:09,910
Like like a lot of time. Not all the time.

45
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:15,780
You know, when it's something that you really need to meet with me or when is something really very specific, you get to send it by me.

46
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:25,070
Okay. Okay. So, okay, so now I would like to hear from you.

47
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:30,140
So what is your name?

48
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:36,860
And I forgot. Usually I bring kind of light paper, so then you can put your name the first week.

49
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:40,399
So it will be good if you can do that kind of like have like a label or whatever.

50
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:49,430
So then they can see your names and then tell me which program you are and department and tell me very briefly

51
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:54,919
what are your expectations about this or what ways that you want to take a course in nutritional epidemiology?

52
00:04:54,920 --> 00:05:01,550
Because this is not I mean, this is a required course for some students in their Master of Science program and in the Bachelor in Nutrition.

53
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:07,819
But for other students, it's not a requirement. So then I'm assuming that if you are taking it is because you have some expectations.

54
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:16,840
Are you really want to take it? So I'll start here. My name is Rene and I'm in m.p.h. science program.

55
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:24,050
And what I'm expecting is, I guess, like, just to gain technical skill and because.

56
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:30,790
Used a lot in the health care. Oh.

57
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:39,630
Okay. Okay. My name is down to seven here, and that's nutrition fries.

58
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:46,370
Uh, you know, I sort of. It's a required course for me, but, you know, a semester.

59
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:51,290
I wasn't trying to improve their skills. For sure.

60
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:58,660
Johnson went also. Remember, I mean, it's good that you want to learn more, but we will do everything, he says.

61
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:02,270
But the idea is that also you have to learn the methods independent of SAS.

62
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:07,460
I mean, the resources are relevant in a way. We could do it in our liquidation instead at whatever ratio.

63
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:21,889
So think about learning the methods. Okay, I can use like your MPH and I really want to continue doing research in nutritional biology.

64
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:30,620
So what I would like to get out of this course is to learn the best statistical analysis techniques for different

65
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:39,710
types of epidemiological studies and how to synthesize that together in papers and prepare those for publication.

66
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:50,060
Hi, I'm Jennifer from the second year and this is a required course for me, you know.

67
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:55,550
Who are you working with? Working with Erica. Oh, with Eric.

68
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:59,780
Okay. And, um, I hope to learn.

69
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:11,260
Specifically. Become better at like interpreting the situation agreed to.

70
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:18,130
Yes. That's basically. Okay, good. My name is Celltrion.

71
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:22,409
Second year I'm a student specifically.

72
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:26,580
I want to learn some substitution analysis in this course.

73
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,720
Now, I think I mentioned to you earlier.

74
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:40,100
Okay. Yeah, and it depends on the substitution analysis, but if you still have questions, we can kind of like meet up and then I will show you my.

75
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:46,350
Yeah. Because you are doing that for your thesis and. Oh, hi, I'm Julie.

76
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:54,340
And I was okay. Yeah, I'm a student and I haven't had the use of before, so I want to know something about.

77
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:59,420
I think you'll find communists. Yes. Och, I am.

78
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:03,590
And then I'm also a seven year and a student.

79
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:07,249
Senior physical science. And his wasn't a required course for me.

80
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:15,280
But I'm interested in this process for like epidemiology is really important for population health study.

81
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:20,800
So I want to thank you and see you on a section here.

82
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:30,470
And uh, for me, I don't, I don't really know if I would like to go into research in the future, but I think it's a good.

83
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:37,220
So that's why I ask. I mean, can you do any research?

84
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:44,380
And I don't know if this is because I am also able to have.

85
00:08:46,060 --> 00:09:02,780
I. I'm also.

86
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:13,740
All right. Not that I.

87
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:28,780
This. There's a bottle trapped inside this apartment.

88
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:38,050
I am interested in your position and the fact that I'm very much involved, not your cancer and nutritional health.

89
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:42,970
I just want to give a knowledge of what it's like to do something. I'm not going to.

90
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:55,490
N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A. without student who is free.

91
00:09:55,620 --> 00:10:01,280
Because I want to learn about all the different ways of breaking down nutrition and how to measure it.

92
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,030
I know you can look at fatty acids and things like that.

93
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:16,050
I don't have knowledge on all the other ways that you can break interpretation down and then just learning the different methods of measuring the.

94
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,400
What that means.

95
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:32,330
I mean, I am sick of hearing pictures like that and I really enjoy the immunology coursework and because I'm really great at this one.

96
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:46,870
That's why I'm sitting here and I see me because I was in the army by the same time nineties in the future.

97
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:54,260
So that's why I thought this person help me and then my mentor and when she wants me to take that.

98
00:10:55,490 --> 00:11:02,450
Okay, good. Okay. Who's who's not in nutrition sciences, I think.

99
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:16,890
Okay. Okay. So how is your general nutrition knowledge in terms of knowing the basics of nutrition, you know, going to like social care?

100
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:20,360
I would say I'm kind of the nutrition person. Oh, you're you did?

101
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:23,750
How about how are you? Nadia okay.

102
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:27,410
So because you can see that most students are from nutrition.

103
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:30,640
So then I neither want to take for granted that people don't.

104
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:37,700
I mean when I'm talking about this one answer these whatever, right? So then if there is anything that you don't know, please stop me and then me.

105
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:42,139
I mean, what are you talking about? Right? Because sometimes there's a stunted knowledge made kind of like I mean,

106
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:51,650
it's usually not that relevant because we are really focusing on the methods, but by for some particular topics they will be more relevant.

107
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:56,480
So then you may feel kind of like more lost if I start talking.

108
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,649
I mean that everyone knows what I'm talking about, so please stop me and then me.

109
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:04,129
I mean, can you kind of like go back a little bit on this plane there? This.

110
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:11,510
Okay, okay, good. Thank you so much. That was very informative and yeah.

111
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:14,809
And then same as Kelly and Jennifer are doing, if you can do that.

112
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:17,810
And then I mean, keep that for this class.

113
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:24,050
So then because I'm terrible, I mean, my memory thought it was so then I and I would like really to approach you or maybe so.

114
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:33,560
So but I'm and I'm so bad at that. So and if there is any particular names that are difficult to pronounce for me,

115
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:39,200
I mean, I'm a Spanish bigot, which believe me, I'm handicapped for most languages.

116
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:45,920
So of like and terrible appearance in any kind of like name that is not in a Spanish.

117
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:54,200
So even the English names though I made by late so so there is I know in campus there is some thing

118
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:59,210
that you can kind of like recall your name and I have seen that at least one student has done it.

119
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:05,719
So you can do that if you want me to kind of like pronounce your name more or less close to what it is.

120
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:09,590
I mean, I would encourage you to do that if if you don't, my name is okay.

121
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:17,000
I mean, I, you know, if I could do something completely different but just still recognize something, then that that would be okay.

122
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:22,490
Okay. Okay. The other thing is that I see that the.

123
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:28,160
Okay, yeah. Oh yeah. I mean, how you can approach me too.

124
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:32,479
You don't need to call me Dr. Bailey, but if is available, you can call me.

125
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,379
And you feel more comfortable calling me that I. Well, you know, but whatever, that's fine.

126
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:43,230
I mean, just call me whatever you want, but I don't feel like I mean, without an insult to of course, kind of.

127
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:48,950
I got me. Call me. I'm not me. That may mean that the professor made me whatever.

128
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:56,630
Right. So that that's fine. Okay. So that I'm assuming that everyone here has the requisites are all of my thing,

129
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:02,839
my still and I think it was you right that you told me and you already got over, right?

130
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:09,290
Right. Yeah. So, so again, at source knowledge is highly desirable because we will be doing things and assess.

131
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:13,159
But don't worry about that because I'm giving you all the gold.

132
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:17,030
So you just need to take the gold and use that as a template.

133
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:24,620
And this is not to I mean, the purpose of that is that I mean, I'm not going to test doing how well are you, what parameter sets?

134
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:32,810
I mean, I just really want to know that you understand the methods and that you kind of like come up with with the proper calculations, right?

135
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:37,700
So don't worry about that. And also in the in the last time.

136
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:47,239
But we are going to do is that I'm going to pair you with I mean you certainly try to pair people who are very skilled with size,

137
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:51,710
with people who feel a little less scale. So then that way you have each other also.

138
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:55,310
But I will be here to hug you all the time. So don't don't worry about that.

139
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:04,460
So sizes shouldn't be an issue. So one of the things I need and I want to I'm going to take note of that.

140
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:20,940
Otherwise I would at. Instead I will send like an announcement with some sort of document or something like that, and I will roll the duck.

141
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:27,390
So you of like put your name and how comfortable you feel incessantly saying, I feel comfortable.

142
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:33,389
I feel a little rusty or I don't know any sense. Okay. So that way I will kind of labor you in the laps based on that.

143
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:36,420
Okay. So then I, I think.

144
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,960
And take a note here so they never remember. I don't forget. Probably I wouldn't do that next week, but.

145
00:15:53,870 --> 00:16:04,579
Okay. Okay. So the the the way that this class is formatted is that we are going to cover one topic every two weeks except for today.

146
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:13,399
To this day. Just introduction. That's right. So we will start our first topic next week, which actually next week is actually not related to topic.

147
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:17,180
So who do we want to pick one week and wonder why they are going to play pool together?

148
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:22,660
Because the idea is that we are donating theory and practice during every class.

149
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:32,230
Right? Mostly we could say. I mean, it's really tiring for you to be listening to me all the time and also because that I think is better for you.

150
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:38,780
You can integrate the things I'm telling you if you have to do it on the on the same moment on this bottom.

151
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:43,189
Right. If I kind of, like tell you everything and then you have to do the lab the next week.

152
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:47,090
The next week, you have forgotten about everything I told you. Right. So?

153
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:53,480
So that way. I mean, sometimes I will talk a little more during the first class and you will have more lather in the second.

154
00:16:54,020 --> 00:17:00,250
But other times it will be kind of like more or less half, half depending on depending on the topic.

155
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:05,850
And then the idea here is practice, practice, practice. I mean, usually in order to learn the methods, you have to do them right?

156
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:09,769
Because just really in this kind of like if is not enough, right?

157
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:21,020
Or listen. Okay. So there are some recommended revisions in the in the in campus and in the syllabus, and all of them will be posted.

158
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:25,760
There are many. Don't panic. I'm not asking you to read everything.

159
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:30,920
So what I will do is that I'll let you know in advance if you really need to read that in detail,

160
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:36,740
because we are going to discuss that, or you just need to browse quickly or even just skip for your wrinkles.

161
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:41,660
Because sometimes, I mean, the are things that I want you to have for the future because I mean, those are good sources.

162
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:50,110
Many, many of them are classic papers, nutritional epidemiol, epidemiology, or even they kind of like they're the chapters of the textbook.

163
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:54,610
Right. So then you can keep them maybe to read them in detail, but you can keep them for the future.

164
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:57,679
So I'll tell you the things that you really need to really,

165
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:02,450
because sometimes there will be like a couple of manuscripts that we are actually going to discuss.

166
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:11,020
Okay, but either use or don't worry about seem to me so this is not our class heavy on grading.

167
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:15,710
Oh, this is a textbook. This is the nutritional epidemiology by Walter Winick.

168
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:23,239
So I think I mean he has every major, but he's already kind of rich in that.

169
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:28,250
I'm not sure if he's going to publish the fourth edition because this one is already a little going to like on.

170
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:35,329
But I mean methods many of the methods really don't inspire writers.

171
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:41,030
So it's kind of like I mean, people start doing new methods, but, but these are like the basics of,

172
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:47,030
uh, of nutritional epi that I think they apply it kind of like it doesn't matter.

173
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:56,299
Probably ten years will still be applying, right? So you don't need to buy this expensive book unless I mean, if you are maybe a beach,

174
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:59,780
the student who you are going to be an additional epidemiologist? Definitely.

175
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:07,520
I mean, this is sort of a book to have. I'm sure there must be copies in the library for the rest of you.

176
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:11,629
Again, I have a few kind of like scan chapters.

177
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:16,150
I'm sure that's illegal, but I still I'm reading, but I don't think I see anything.

178
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:16,760
I compare live.

179
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:24,950
Maybe this is just a few use of it and I'm sure that there will it would be okay without so so because I'm not scanning the whole book.

180
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:33,140
I mean, just like a couple of. Okay. So, so where we kind of like but this is kind of like for you to know that this is like a reference book.

181
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:40,580
Now this book, even though is great, is a reference is super dense.

182
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:46,400
So it's kind of like when you read the chapters is like you need like I don't know to

183
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,959
kind of like within click slowly sorry and read them probably three or four times.

184
00:19:50,960 --> 00:20:00,770
So we in Spanish we say it's a levity you it's a brick because it's so heavy and kind of like, so dense and so fake, right?

185
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:11,780
So sorry is great. Is too much information together and kind of like I what I'm going to try to do in the glasses is a lot of that information,

186
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:15,310
trying to digest it for you to swallow it kind of like easy.

187
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:22,130
Okay, so that's that and kind of like get rid of the more complicated stuff and just make it as easy as possible.

188
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:32,030
Also, because I'm aware that it's Friday, 1 to 3 p.m. is the worst possible time to write the last like this.

189
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:35,990
So. So I know that you need some coffee.

190
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:42,620
You can go get some more coffee. But anyway, okay, so the grading and everything I'm saying here is in the syllabus.

191
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:46,730
So. So the last assignments hours will be 60% of your grade.

192
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,120
And the final. That's that's not correct.

193
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:54,140
It says in classics somebody will be. Will be back home.

194
00:20:54,350 --> 00:21:00,200
It will be a day home exam. It will be a 40%. This is my kind of like the scale.

195
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:06,350
I am a very generous grader, so that's why I usually put the threshold on their degrees a little higher.

196
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:15,050
So on collaboration, I all the laughs are going to be conducted in pairs.

197
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:23,600
So you of course, I mean, you've you will be discussing the how to do things with your with your classmates,

198
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,890
and then you can comment on the things that you had to do on your own.

199
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:32,899
So that's fine. I mean, I'm happy that you collaborate because this is I mean, your public health is still this.

200
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:36,910
And this is a highly collaborative field, right? I mean, you really need to collaborate with other people.

201
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,530
You are not expected to know everything always. Right.

202
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:45,050
So and then when you collaborate with people, I mean, these are synergistic kind of like said that you learn more, right?

203
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:50,450
However, you must prepare, Anthony, your own rhythm responses, right?

204
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:55,100
One thing is collaborating and the other thing is just copy whatever your classmate was frightened by.

205
00:21:56,150 --> 00:22:02,930
And those answers should reflect your own knowledge. Right? And the final exam is to be then alone.

206
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:08,959
So that's that's why I mean, even during the labs you make kind of like working a little closer by the you have to make sure that you

207
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,460
are learning because in the final exam you will be you will have to do unsaid everything on your own.

208
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:20,780
Okay. All all the lab assignments are due on line in canvas before the start of the class.

209
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:24,169
So Fridays at 1 p.m. every every other week, more or less.

210
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:28,520
I mean, not next week, because we haven't started anything I did the other week.

211
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:34,860
And if, of course, if there's anything emergencies or whatever that you couldn't kind of like turn the,

212
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:39,170
the, the homework time, just let me know in advance.

213
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:52,100
But please, no lame excuses like kind of they re they all one is my dog and their homework they kind of like now it's more like a computer virus.

214
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:56,509
Right. Anyway, so all materials are already posted in canvas.

215
00:22:56,510 --> 00:23:00,170
I'm assuming that you have access to that. You know, let me know.

216
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:07,939
And then in terms of email, you have any question, you can email anytime.

217
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:13,909
But I'm kind of like this fall, actually,

218
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:22,970
I'm implementing a little more kind of like a restrictive policy on answering email because I'm just checking my email at the end of the workday,

219
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:29,180
sometimes again in the morning, but not during the day. But I am not kind of like at 9 p.m. or something like that.

220
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:33,240
So then if you kind of like send me a question at 9 p.m., I,

221
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:41,570
I may not see it until five or 6 p.m. the next day or sometimes if there's something that is given to so that right.

222
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:46,099
So I'm most of the time I probably will answer you much quicker,

223
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:52,250
but I'm just telling you that because particularly if the homework is due Friday at 1 p.m.,

224
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:58,430
don't send me emails Thursday night, be in because most likely I won't answer.

225
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:03,620
Right. So then plan in advance and and be careful about that.

226
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:10,009
And I understand I mean everyone does that. I mean, we all procrastinate and we tend to listen to the last moment.

227
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:15,410
But but try not to do that. Okay. So, so because otherwise, I mean, you may not have the help that you need.

228
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:20,390
Okay, so this is the schedule.

229
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:24,730
So basically today we're doing that introduction on the,

230
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:33,520
on this US Jumpstart Clinic and then you can see that these are how that that they'll be ability because I mean you've

231
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:40,670
seen two weeks for covering everything the theory on the lab that the first stuff is actually two different topics.

232
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:49,100
So it's just a variation in the diet and measurement of diet. But by then we'll pull together in that topic.

233
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:56,420
So then you can see that once we finish one topic, then the homework for that topic is you the following week.

234
00:24:56,510 --> 00:25:11,750
Okay, so that's what they then they also reveal that I've six in total and then the last the last week we will do I kind of like

235
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:20,660
very fast review one day home messages and things like that and then you will be able to start working on the final exam,

236
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:27,080
but you still have one more week to finish. Stay home on your own and you will be due on December 16.

237
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:32,130
That is no personal. Okay. Okay.

238
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:37,800
And this has any of you taking a basic down with me?

239
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:43,950
Yes. So, I mean, you know, this this this chap.

240
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:47,340
So this is this is my philosophy for all the classes that I teach.

241
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:54,959
So this is a very kind of like all concept in psychology that I'm sure that people maybe feel that is how they do now.

242
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,380
But I still like it. It's called the flow experience.

243
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:06,030
And I was going by that and psychologist who has a Hungarian last name and it's impossible to pronounce.

244
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:13,170
So so then the idea is that that he says that in order to be in flow,

245
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:21,120
the flow is to be kind of like in that setting that you are so focused on something that you basically lose track of anything.

246
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:21,330
Right.

247
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:29,410
And this kind of like is not being mindful necessarily virtually you are losing track of your surroundings and that right by your being mindful,

248
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:33,600
whatever you are doing, so then you are actually enjoying what you are doing, right?

249
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,750
Because I mean, you're not thinking another thing. So you are really focused, right?

250
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:45,120
So in order to be in flow, there must be a good balance between your skills and challenge and the challenge, right?

251
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:54,599
So the idea is that if the either challenge is much higher than the skills you have, you get anxious, you get frustrated, you get anxious.

252
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:59,669
That's often right. But is this guilt so much higher than the challenge?

253
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:02,670
Then you get bored, right? Because this is so easy that I mean.

254
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,530
Yeah. So I don't want you to cross any of those boundaries.

255
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:12,299
I want you to be in flow. Right? So then for the anxious people, plenty of help, don't worry.

256
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:18,480
And particularly I know SAS can be very frustrating, but you try over and over something, nothing, any to work.

257
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,799
Right? So it's okay that you try because that's how you learn to.

258
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:27,390
Sometimes you try different things and then you learn on your own how to solve the problem, which is great.

259
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:31,940
I mean, that's the best way of learning, but don't try for 2 hours, right?

260
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:39,120
Because that would be very frustrating. So if after trying a few times you feel like, no, I'm stuck, then ask for help, okay?

261
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:46,710
I don't want you to be frustrated with something like Semicolon says, okay, so and therefore the people,

262
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:51,480
you are really bored that you feel like, oh, this is too easy, ask for more challenging tasks.

263
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:58,079
I never had anyone in the lab asking for that, but it may happen that some people may feel like, Oh, this is too easy.

264
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:07,740
So then they're happy to provide more challenging tasks. Okay, so again, if you cross the borders of anxiety or boredom, just let me know.

265
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:18,209
Okay? Um, also, I'm constantly change in addition to, for trying to adapt it to your needs.

266
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:23,670
And actually this year I'm kind of like changing the homeworks out the same.

267
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:25,230
In essence, I'm changing a few things,

268
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:32,069
but I'm making them more clear than in previous years because I have learned that there are some things that I felt they were clear,

269
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:35,399
but they are not because students keep making the same mistakes.

270
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:39,300
And then at some point I have to make that okay with my mistake that I was not being clear.

271
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:43,649
Right. So then this year I'm kind of like making everything I have,

272
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:49,070
kind of like a box with graded the same as I'm doing it and their basic set of criteria for success.

273
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:53,399
So then you can check those things. I'm giving you more detailed instructions.

274
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:59,940
Kind of like to make sure that all of you understand what you are doing because sometimes they're the business could be very generic,

275
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:05,990
sometimes you may be right. So because I'm changing those things, then maybe typos, okay?

276
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:09,809
Because this and I mean, I, I check and recheck.

277
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:11,250
But, you know, sometimes, I mean,

278
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:16,500
there may be something that like a remnant of the previous homework and maybe doesn't make sense or whatever, just let me know.

279
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:21,420
Okay. As soon as you find something that or this doesn't look like, okay, let me know.

280
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:26,249
And then we will go back and again once more.

281
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:30,299
Don't feel desperate if you don't M.S. or you feel rusty or whatever.

282
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:34,530
It's okay. It's okay. This is not kind of like this shouldn't be a problem.

283
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:40,140
Okay, so. So why are you here? You already told me, right?

284
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:49,950
Yeah. By the way, I mean, if you are here on a Friday, 1 to 3 P is because I believe that you love nutritional epidemiology,

285
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:54,480
because otherwise I'm sure there are many more interesting things that you can be doing.

286
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:59,760
So. So that's why because this is such a hard time to be themselves class.

287
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:08,250
I mean, I, I try to keep this as light as possible and entertaining, but I mean, I'm not a clown.

288
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:15,479
I think I try hard, but I'm not. And also, I mean, this the topics sometimes are dry.

289
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:22,020
I mean, because the some methods and methods, I mean, it's not I mean, sometimes it is difficult to make them later.

290
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:26,849
Right. So so I don't want to discourage anyone of taking the class.

291
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:30,790
But did you feel like oh, well, I mean, this is not really for me. And by all means,

292
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:37,779
kind of like I think about what you are getting into the ratio kind of like this is going to be a matter of class and it's not difficult.

293
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:42,190
I mean, in the end, you all of you will probably get on a because I'm very generous ingredient.

294
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,300
So even though you feel that oh, this is I don't understand this that well,

295
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:55,270
it's okay because my intention is that at least you get the general idea and then at some point in your life it will ring a bell, right?

296
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:58,299
So sometimes, I mean, some something a little obscure.

297
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:02,050
So then you will feel like, oh, I don't think I get that, that well,

298
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:07,329
but as long as you are able to follow and do the homework and kind of like get the idea, that's fine.

299
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:11,260
Don't, don't try to, to think that you have to understand every single detail.

300
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:17,800
Okay. But, but first you make sure that that you want to be here, because if it's a friend, you have them.

301
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:23,470
Right. But anyway, regardless of that, I mean, one of the reasons why you are here is because we are what we eat.

302
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:31,750
Right. So so I'm assuming that most of you, even the two people who are not from nutritional sciences and interesting in nutrition,

303
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,790
because otherwise they wouldn't be here. Right.

304
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:40,720
And you're interested in nutrition because we know that nutrition is so important for our bodies, for our health.

305
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:47,889
Right. And this is true. I mean, if you eat crappy, then your house is crappy, right?

306
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:50,890
If you eat healthy, you'll live a healthy life. Right.

307
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:54,470
So that's kind of like I mean, that's a no brainer.

308
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:56,320
I mean, that that's how it works. Right?

309
00:31:58,090 --> 00:32:05,860
So so one of the main goals of the course is not only showing you the methods, which is, I mean, the main thing, right?

310
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:16,480
But also when you learn the methods, you learn to become a critical reader of the literature or the scientific literature,

311
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:22,360
because not everything that is published is always correct, believe me.

312
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:28,030
I mean, it's amazing. But I mean, sometimes you see papers published and you feel like, oh, why they do.

313
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:33,790
I mean, they they use this. I mean, that's wrong. And maybe it's because the reviewers missed that for whatever reason.

314
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:38,230
I mean, most of the of the papers that are published in theory have peer review.

315
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:41,740
And in theory the reviewers usually do a very good job.

316
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:49,060
But sometimes some things get, you know, particularly you are not in the field or whatever or something that is mixed.

317
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:53,499
So then you are not so much into the message, but you are into other things.

318
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:59,290
Then you criticize the things that you know about, but you don't. I mean, you miss the things that you don't know about, right?

319
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:05,880
So then sometimes, I mean, there are paper that are published that are kind of like, well, that's a completely wrong analysis, right?

320
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:13,810
Or sometimes the analysis is not necessarily wrong is perfectly fine, but the results are not really discussed,

321
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:20,139
taking into account all the potential kind of like biases that could kind of like deal to those results.

322
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:24,850
I mean, sometimes people believe that there are too much, right? Kind of like I mean, they see like a positive version.

323
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:28,300
I say, Oh, yeah, that's great. And this is because this causes this.

324
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:35,110
And we know that epidemiology is not about that. I mean, epidemiology is chicken associations.

325
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:37,030
I mean, observational epidemiology.

326
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:42,399
We know that there are I mean, it's very difficult to establish causation because we know the result was confounding.

327
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,460
Right. We know there are all sorts of biases. Right.

328
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:54,940
So we have to kind of like also always keep things with a grain of salt and then be being very cautious when when you kind of like interpret results.

329
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:58,020
Right. So that will help you also with the literature, right?

330
00:33:58,030 --> 00:34:06,130
I mean, you will see in nutrition is always, always happens that kind of like nutrition is very sexy, right?

331
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:12,480
I mean, people like it because I mean, people everyone eats, right. So then that that makes it to the headlines so bad, right?

332
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:20,499
Or is like, oh, broccoli's good for prostate cancer and then eat more broccoli, which is not going to have anything against broccoli is wonderful,

333
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:24,250
but it's kind of like, well, I mean, maybe it's broccoli or maybe it's the other things that come with broccoli, right?

334
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:29,200
So but then people kind of like don't understand that, right?

335
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:33,519
So then that's also something important for you in the future too.

336
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:38,169
Kind of like if you are in the nutrition fail and then you have to tell people, I mean, your funny half people.

337
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:41,560
So they're not some people you will have to form dietary guidelines.

338
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:47,710
So then in order to tell people why things are like they are, you really need to have a good understanding of, of,

339
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:55,090
of kind of like how nutrition works and how the studies work and what are the potential kind of like limitations, right?

340
00:34:55,390 --> 00:35:05,890
So, so learning the method, well, kind of like and learning the type of data we work with will help you with those limitations.

341
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:10,960
Right. So that you won't believe everything that is published and you will remain skeptical.

342
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:16,780
It's good to remain a skeptic. Right. That's that's that's what we should talk about right now.

343
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:20,260
In any case, discourse is mainly about learning the methods. Right?

344
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:27,070
If you are interested in just learning to be critical, we then you can take that course.

345
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:29,760
Although I'm not offering this year because I will be. I mean, I.

346
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:38,299
Having been offering that for the last three years, I know it's been kind of like I will be offering that in the winter of 2024.

347
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:47,100
But you won't be here, right? So I'm sorry. But anyway, so so that was like a guess one day for being in the literature.

348
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:54,460
But anyway, so then Alison got stuck with this course anyway that it will be okay.

349
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:57,980
And now I'm going to put you like an example. This is an old sample.

350
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:08,030
So this paper is from 2005, but I like it because I used to do a lot of research on types of oil and the and you know,

351
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:11,150
that always have different flat compositions. Right.

352
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:20,320
So, so when you think about that before they use it for cooking, many people think about some of the healthy also, for example, olive oil, right.

353
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:24,769
So that's one of the the ones that we were using the Mediterranean diet.

354
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:28,070
Right. Which other healthy oils can you'll think about?

355
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:37,520
Do all of you use Cookie? Oh, for just for cooking.

356
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:41,390
Yeah, for cooking. Well, for cooking or for using for the food industry.

357
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:46,430
Omega three fatty acids like those oils or something.

358
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,230
Oh, yeah. No, no, but that's all. I mean, think about kind of like, more like a guideline for.

359
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:56,260
I mean, have you had people tell you I mean, I want to cook healthy?

360
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:59,780
I mean, what would you recommend? Avocado. Oil. Avocado?

361
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:04,190
Yeah, it's high in poly. Yeah, I mean, that expensive.

362
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:08,809
Right. So one of the reasons why people don't use olive oil so much because it's expensive.

363
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:11,810
So think about it like a cheaper kind of like canola.

364
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,099
Canola. Exactly.

365
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:22,160
So canola is like similar to olive oil in fatty acid composition, but and also has alpha linolenic, which is an omega three fatty acid.

366
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:27,500
It's not like they're long change omega three fatty acids, but it's a good fatty acid.

367
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:34,579
It doesn't have all the things that olive oil has, of course. I mean, olive oil has also has some inflammatory kind of like seeds.

368
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:39,319
And they're kind of like, I don't know, antioxidants, fatty liver.

369
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:43,340
Right. But but canola oil is a healthy oil and relatively cheap.

370
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:49,040
Right. Okay. So now but not everyone cooks with canola oil, with olive oil.

371
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:54,980
I mean, there are many other all in the market and there are many out in the world so far more.

372
00:37:55,040 --> 00:38:00,860
Actually, even though here in the US you can see it is actually highly consumed in the world.

373
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:08,660
So it's consumed in many parts and used to be consumed a lot in Latin America is also consumed in Africa and in Asia.

374
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:15,990
So what do you know about palm oil? Yeah, it's going to have half price.

375
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:29,459
So it's kind of sad. And what do you know about saturated fat? That's that is a tricky question because that's a controversial topic.

376
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:35,070
Now, for the last few years, it's been. But what had you heard about?

377
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:42,550
Saturated fat always is a good option, but it's associated with associated with cardio metabolic.

378
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:49,120
Yeah. So in the past, we've been hearing that you should decrease saturated fat and increase polyunsaturated fat.

379
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:59,430
Right. So now it's a little controversial because some people are I mean, so for this very genetic I mean,

380
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:04,730
there are many fatty acids within that group and some fatty acids may not be that terrible.

381
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:10,200
Right. But there are a few like for example, Palmitic Garcia, then that really increases cholesterol, right?

382
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:17,370
And again, we go into another can of worms because cholesterol is supposed to be like a traditional risk factor for heart disease.

383
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:23,450
And now people say that, well, maybe not. I mean, what I mean, we are changing muscle, kind of like you increase.

384
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:26,880
I mean, it's better to have more poly the more that that for sure.

385
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:36,700
Right. So so then giving you that context and showing you this kind of like abstract, I'm not even showing you the after.

386
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:42,770
I'm just giving you the title because the title is very descriptive. So this is a, um, a table.

387
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:51,240
It's different. Palm oil preparations reduce plasma cholesterol concentrations and all the cholesterol

388
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:56,970
accumulation compared to coconut coconut oil in hypercholesterolemia canisters.

389
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:04,270
I know it's a very long talk, but actually, yes, a lot of information.

390
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:09,009
But if you read that kind of like reviews plus McAlester, that that sounds like good a good thing.

391
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:18,010
Right. So because you reduce plasma cholesterol and all the outer accumulation, then you're decreasing the potential risk for heart disease.

392
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:21,610
Right. So it looks like while palm oil must be good.

393
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:30,370
Right. And actually, I took that kind of like an article for my list.

394
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:38,019
That is a list of articles I was in now website from the palm oil industry because of course,

395
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:42,790
I mean, the palm oil industry wants to kind of like sell that palm oil is good for you.

396
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:48,400
Is not that is bad for you. Right. So then you see that and say, oh, yeah, then palm oil is good for you, right?

397
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:53,919
That that that's what looks like. Right. So what are the things?

398
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:59,230
That sounds a little fishy here? Based just on the title.

399
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:04,060
I mean what are the things that you. It's always us as compared to.

400
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:12,340
Yeah. And what happened with coconut oil. Coconut oil is another controversial topic.

401
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:16,510
It's it's having high in saturated fat. Yeah.

402
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:20,170
I mean, is there another type of saturated fat that may not?

403
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:27,440
I mean, it's controversial topic because I know people feel that coconut oil is super healthy and may not be that healthy or the best.

404
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:33,370
Right. But anyway, if you just compare the saturated fat Saturday, fat increases cholesterol no matter what.

405
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:36,910
Right. So then you have something that is even higher.

406
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:41,950
Of course, palm oil compared with coconut oil is going to look like this better.

407
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:56,260
Right. So and the other thing is that in who's doing that and hypercholesterolemia cancer is not any type of cancer.

408
00:41:56,260 --> 00:42:00,549
Right. I mean, first, I mean, this may not be a good human model to start with.

409
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:05,020
Right. But it may be it may be good. I mean, I'm not saying that I'm still going to be like a mammal.

410
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:09,339
Right. But they're hypercholesterolemia. So then maybe the same thing happens with humans.

411
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:15,750
Maybe that happens in hyper hypercholesterolemia humans, but not in in in healthy humans.

412
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:22,059
Right. So there are many kind of like nuances here that kind of makes you feel like this is correct.

413
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:25,660
I'm not saying that the the investigator were doing something wrong.

414
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:30,639
I mean, this is probably a good trial, was well done with the hamsters.

415
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,920
Everything was well controlled. The analysis was well done.

416
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:39,460
But kind of like is just I mean, you cannot infer from that that oil is necessarily good for you.

417
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:44,350
You cannot infer either that is bad for you. Right. You just you can infer whatever it says.

418
00:42:44,350 --> 00:42:54,130
Right. And that plays a very important point. That is compared with what and this is something that in nutrition is so important

419
00:42:54,760 --> 00:43:01,570
because people talking about substitutions before people don't just eat things isolated,

420
00:43:01,690 --> 00:43:08,700
they eat this in a dietary. But then and when they increase something, they usually decrease something else or they substitute.

421
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:15,580
Like when you tell them, don't eat so much red meat, eat more fish, then this is the addition that is fish by red meat.

422
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:21,639
So then the benefits that you can see, maybe because fish is good for you, but also because red meat is bad for you.

423
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:29,050
Right? But if instead of that kind of like substitution, you do fish or red meat, I don't know, sugar.

424
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:32,410
So maybe sugar is worse than red meat then? Red meat is not that bad.

425
00:43:32,470 --> 00:43:37,330
Right? So then you have to be very careful about the type of station that you are doing.

426
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:40,460
Right. And then I have the the menu is me.

427
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:43,980
My, my son told me that million meals are now green.

428
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:49,060
I don't want to know why, but I like the menus. This is my diet plan.

429
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:52,240
Make all of my friends cupcakes. The farther they get, the thinner I look.

430
00:43:52,510 --> 00:43:58,270
Yeah, I mean, of course, if you like your overweight, but everyone is obese, then you look thinner, right?

431
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:03,040
So then it's kind of like you have to be very careful about the reference.

432
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:06,220
Okay. So that I will be insisting a lot on that in this course.

433
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:15,970
Okay. So I will kind of like very briefly and I will go very fast on that because that the

434
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:19,720
components of diet that we are going to study nutritional epidemiology are many.

435
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:25,020
Right. So you have a whole list here of many things that we notice.

436
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:27,969
Right. You do have also additives and chemicals and whatever.

437
00:44:27,970 --> 00:44:36,580
But in this culture, we're going to restrict what we say to nutrients, essential nutrients and make your energy sources.

438
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:41,430
So which means it will be this will be the moderately micronutrients of addition.

439
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:46,150
I mean, that is on the register and this will be a model of the macronutrients alcohol.

440
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:49,720
And so that that's what we will be studying.

441
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:59,290
Now one of the useful things in nutrition is that should you study nutrients or should you study foods?

442
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:04,060
Right. And then the actually the answer is, is both, right.

443
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:08,680
Because I mean, nutrients have you to link better with the biology, right?

444
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:14,050
So this is kind of like if you kind of like see that? Oh yeah, omega three fatty acids from fish,

445
00:45:14,350 --> 00:45:20,319
they are protective for coronary heart disease while because omega three fatty acids are inflammatory, anti-inflammatory or whatever.

446
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:24,490
Right. So there's a whole biological pathway there that you can see that they go.

447
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:28,670
So now it's coming from those omega three fatty acids have a less inflammatory and so on.

448
00:45:28,690 --> 00:45:32,410
So then the the biological hypothesis can be tested, right?

449
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:44,349
But then when you think about what people are eating, people are not eating nutrients, people are eating foods and foods are full of many nutrients.

450
00:45:44,350 --> 00:45:53,590
Right. So we tend to think about I mean, in the past when people were said that you shouldn't eat so many eggs because they have a lot of cholesterol.

451
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:58,329
Sure. But they also have they are a good source of protein. They have lots of micronutrient.

452
00:45:58,330 --> 00:46:02,620
They have many other things, you know, so it's not only cholesterol, right.

453
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:07,149
So then that's what happened with foods that kind of like trying to isolate the

454
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:11,050
effect of a nutrient is very difficult because the food has many other things,

455
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:16,929
right? So sometimes beneficial, sometimes not that beneficial and sometimes it depends.

456
00:46:16,930 --> 00:46:23,010
I mean, you cannot really put nutrition not going to like but good because it depends on the whole dietary patterns.

457
00:46:23,770 --> 00:46:29,850
So the advantage of foods is that actually you can translate them better to dietary recommendations.

458
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:34,810
I mean, you can tell people you should be eating fish, right? Not you should be eating omega three fatty acids.

459
00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:42,580
I know. So you are. Boy, the that people people tend to want to get the multiple.

460
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:47,000
Kind of like, Oh, if I can get some supplements, then I will be fine, right?

461
00:46:47,230 --> 00:46:51,190
No, you won't be fine. I mean, it's okay to have supplements when you are deficient on something.

462
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:55,720
I mean, you are deficient in vitamin D in the in the winter because there's no sun here.

463
00:46:56,080 --> 00:47:01,020
Right. By all means. They go, right? I mean, they supplement. Right. But but those you then kind of like, I mean,

464
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:06,790
you shouldn't just eat omega three fatty acids that the fish fish is going to play better for you probably

465
00:47:07,210 --> 00:47:14,410
or you shouldn't kind of like try to to to make sure that you like this coffee just because you eat a lot,

466
00:47:14,410 --> 00:47:18,610
a bunch of nutrients and supplements, right.

467
00:47:18,610 --> 00:47:25,120
Or even fortified than a blade, that garbage that the food industry makes, kind of like those, those,

468
00:47:25,870 --> 00:47:31,350
I don't know, bars that come fortified with everything and they also come with a lot of sugar.

469
00:47:31,370 --> 00:47:34,710
Right. So anyway, so I mean, you should be eating for, right?

470
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:40,600
So food for is what humans eat and food is what and we are food anyway.

471
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:50,409
So, um, so now I'm going to kind of like show you one example in which you will see why sometimes nutritional epidemiology,

472
00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:53,049
among other fields in epidemiology,

473
00:47:53,050 --> 00:48:03,580
is a little more kind of like complicated in the sense that, that the type of information that we get is, is a little different.

474
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:14,799
Right. So if I asked you to this class that there are 15 of you, I believe anyone who does not eat tomatoes here in the subway,

475
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:19,510
someone because but usually most people y you said you don't eat tomatoes.

476
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:24,819
Oh, yeah. But you cook with tomatoes. Okay.

477
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:29,320
Yeah. No, no, that's not you don't need to this that you cook with tomato.

478
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:36,760
Oh yeah. Because it is difficult to kind of like escape tomatoes because they are so weak.

479
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:41,330
It is. Right. So so everyone here is getting some type of domain, right?

480
00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:45,850
So either role or either cooking or things like that.

481
00:48:45,850 --> 00:48:53,380
Right. So then when you think about it, traditional sin and I'm going to kind of like put the example of smoking, for example,

482
00:48:53,500 --> 00:49:00,230
and we know that smoking is the biblical risk factor that increases your risk for many things, including heart disease, lung cancer.

483
00:49:00,790 --> 00:49:11,170
Right? So think about if you want to study tobacco smoking versus studying lycopene, which is something that is tomatoes are high lycopene.

484
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:17,400
Lycopene is one of those carotenoids. So think about exposure variability.

485
00:49:17,470 --> 00:49:25,830
So with tobacco we do have non smokers on the smokers, right.

486
00:49:26,170 --> 00:49:29,739
So we have a reference is pretty clean, right?

487
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:36,210
It's people who don't smoke. And then there are other people who smoke, maybe some smoke more or less, but dismal.

488
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:41,710
Right. With lycopene, we don't have people who don't eat lycopene.

489
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:47,530
Right. So we have people who need more weed, less, but kind of like we don't have like a clean reference, right?

490
00:49:47,830 --> 00:49:53,380
So you have to kind of like think about in binary terms and think about what would be the right ratio,

491
00:49:53,980 --> 00:50:01,840
what is that which is the insulin someone is most people are more into the same unknown is what you think about that there's no nonresponse people,

492
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:06,729
right? So then kind of like you don't have kind of like that super clean reference.

493
00:50:06,730 --> 00:50:10,240
So okay I, I have zero exposure, right?

494
00:50:10,450 --> 00:50:17,109
Which in tobacco you have it right. So, so that that makes it a little harder for epidemiology.

495
00:50:17,110 --> 00:50:20,489
You can still compare, of course, the low intake with the high intake, right.

496
00:50:20,490 --> 00:50:25,600
And that's for sure. But then the fact that you're in the low intake, we will see later,

497
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:31,479
it may not be like a low intake that it may be deficient in order to show like some changes.

498
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:31,750
Right.

499
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:40,510
So it may happen that the variability in the food intake is very low and that happens with populations that more or less live in the same country.

500
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:44,169
So the variability because most people more or less eat the same.

501
00:50:44,170 --> 00:50:49,570
I mean, I mean that if somebody with 80% is the variability, maybe, maybe very, very small.

502
00:50:51,130 --> 00:50:54,940
Okay. So now I ask you, how many tomatoes do you eat on average in one year?

503
00:50:55,900 --> 00:51:03,690
Who can answer that? You're not really a stewardess and you can't.

504
00:51:03,690 --> 00:51:08,520
I mean, you are looking at me like saying, are you crazy? Well, that's how we collect the data.

505
00:51:08,610 --> 00:51:13,590
Nutritional epidemiology. We ask people, How many collectors do you eat on average every year?

506
00:51:14,010 --> 00:51:20,040
So imagine the type of crappy data that we get. I mean, people do their best, but it's pretty bad.

507
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:27,280
It's pretty, pretty bad, right? So when you think you're compared with smoking, smoking is much easier.

508
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:31,160
I mean, smoking, you go to a smokers and you say, how much do you smoke?

509
00:51:31,170 --> 00:51:34,380
I mean, the ones that you are embarrassed by, more or less.

510
00:51:34,410 --> 00:51:42,299
I don't know. Maybe they're civil rights, but they on average, I mean, that's more much more accurate than kind of like saying, okay, don't say, okay,

511
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:46,709
let me see in the family more because there you see some medicine in there when they get more

512
00:51:46,710 --> 00:51:52,170
with them and they how much and I mean I bring my recipes or when you go to eat outside,

513
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:58,920
I mean, you don't know what you are eating, right? What you're eating, I'll say. So reporting by it is very difficult.

514
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:02,699
I mean, this is beyond that. I mean, sometimes people tell you, oh, yeah, believe data.

515
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:06,000
People are always lying or whatever. No, it's not that they are lying is that they don't know.

516
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:08,639
I mean, and you are nutrition students.

517
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:17,570
What you are probably more aware of kind of like nutrition because university nutrition and they still will you will have problems with that, right?

518
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:20,730
Imagine kind of like people who don't know anything about nutrition.

519
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:26,970
So that's another problem with nutritional data. It has a lot of error, a measurement error.

520
00:52:26,970 --> 00:52:33,840
And that way we have a whole topic of measurement error because there are methods to deal with that and to correct for that.

521
00:52:34,110 --> 00:52:41,510
Okay. And then there is the issue of more people.

522
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:46,159
Most people that's already told you that most people is more or less the same face.

523
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:51,020
And for example, the variability in intake may be very, very low in some population.

524
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:58,010
Like, for example, if you want to, you know, rice and beans are kind of like the staple of of of many Latin American countries.

525
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:04,610
So, I mean, it's true that some people eat more than others. But if you want to kind of like all initial countries,

526
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:11,420
there is a lot of rice consumption by so then kind of like looking at rice may not I mean nation may not be like it

527
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:18,530
may not be easy to see if there is any association of rice with something because most people eat rice everything.

528
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:22,910
Right. So it's not like there are some people that don't eat rice.

529
00:53:22,910 --> 00:53:29,219
We just once a month and people who eat like extensively rice, the French availability,

530
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:33,980
the the low what it is the more difficult to to find any associations.

531
00:53:34,410 --> 00:53:43,070
Okay. There is also the problem of nutrients being is strongly intercalated.

532
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:49,700
Right because when you have something that a food that is the source of two nutrients

533
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:53,530
that actually are kind of like completely different in their associations,

534
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:59,869
then you have the problem of coloniality, right? I mean you can like for example, the typical example is the all Nigerians.

535
00:53:59,870 --> 00:54:02,990
They all Nigerians used to be very high in trans fatty acids. Not anymore.

536
00:54:03,770 --> 00:54:10,849
Trans fatty acids, if you remember, are those that are may that say they're afraid of the basal hydrogenation.

537
00:54:10,850 --> 00:54:20,340
So the idea is that margarine is a good they are all like high poly like soybean and they do partially hydrogenated to get a solid right.

538
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:25,099
So then the idea is to kind of like get rid of double bonds that make things liquid

539
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:29,389
to kind of like get the more kind of like saturated fat that is more Ray Rice.

540
00:54:29,390 --> 00:54:33,110
So then you make it something that can be spread, right?

541
00:54:33,410 --> 00:54:38,270
And originally that was a good idea because the idea was that people wanted to avoid butter.

542
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:46,980
Right. Because it was highly in saturated fat. But then what happened is we always had these good ideas that end up being so stupidly.

543
00:54:47,330 --> 00:54:51,900
So they didn't realize that. Okay, yeah, you are you are getting rid of them.

544
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:56,120
I mean, fish are getting rid of the boli, which you then want, right? Because that's the good thing in.

545
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:59,480
So we notice that they can they will regret it. But then on top of that,

546
00:54:59,750 --> 00:55:06,950
you are getting these old trans fatty acids that change configuration and those are happened to be even worse than saturated fat.

547
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:13,520
Right. So then you have those all margins that still were high enough, linolenic, because that was coming from there.

548
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:15,860
So we know, but they were high interest fatty acids.

549
00:55:16,190 --> 00:55:23,420
So then if you want to kind of like a study where the the two things, I mean it would be possible because it's the same the same for source, right?

550
00:55:25,670 --> 00:55:34,540
So because of all this kind of like challenge challenges in assessing the diet, which is we don't have a great information,

551
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:38,510
this budget of body of anything may be low, the nutrients are strongly correlated.

552
00:55:38,510 --> 00:55:42,850
And also on top of that, dietary patterns may change over time, which happens, right?

553
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:46,760
I mean, people don't eat the same every year, right?

554
00:55:47,810 --> 00:55:54,200
Then there really I mean, there are no really practical methods to measure diet accurately.

555
00:55:54,470 --> 00:55:57,680
Right? I mean, we can measure it, but very kind of loosely.

556
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:04,010
Right. So what we will do in additional epidemiology is that we know that the data is not very good.

557
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:07,459
So what we do is that we rank people, right?

558
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:10,160
So the idea is that I'm not sure how much you are eating,

559
00:56:10,430 --> 00:56:17,090
but at least I can infer that you're eating a lot or you're eating at a level and we will compare those things, right.

560
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:22,460
That's that's the best we can do is not great but is the best we can do with that type of data.

561
00:56:22,790 --> 00:56:27,799
When we are, I mean, when we are fortunate that we have biomarker data and metabolomics data, whatever,

562
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:31,390
that's different because those are kind of like objective data that comes from your tissues.

563
00:56:31,730 --> 00:56:39,350
That's a different issue. But when you are using dietary data that you ask people self-reported and those are the limitations.

564
00:56:40,910 --> 00:56:47,899
And then when you interpret your epidemiologic data, you have to I mean,

565
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:54,110
most of the times you will find in nutritionally weak associations, mostly because of that error.

566
00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:58,250
When you have error that it is, you tend to be kind of like attenuated line.

567
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:05,870
But also this sometimes, I mean, most of the times there is this type of dose response curve that, for example,

568
00:57:06,330 --> 00:57:09,739
you have to think about nutrition, nutritional, some of the things that are essential to us, right?

569
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:12,350
If we don't eat them, we get sick with that. Right?

570
00:57:12,710 --> 00:57:19,430
So let's think about, for example, I mean, if we don't have enough vitamins, I mean, that's not the usual thing.

571
00:57:19,430 --> 00:57:22,669
Now in in develop in kind of like in rich countries,

572
00:57:22,670 --> 00:57:28,520
but but still kind of like micronutrient deficiencies can still be found in, in certain populations.

573
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:35,270
Like, for example, the elderly tend to have a deficiency in B12 because of the kind of life they develop some.

574
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:39,089
Problems in the in the stomach. And then they don't have cervix.

575
00:57:39,090 --> 00:57:42,560
So so they they can be deficient in vitamin B12 and they they can get sick.

576
00:57:42,710 --> 00:57:50,900
Right. So then when you are in this kind of like range of the other distribution and you compare with the optimally, they, of course,

577
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:57,620
you are going to see a huge kind of like of difference by you are going to see that, yeah, these people are perfectly fine and these people are sick.

578
00:57:57,770 --> 00:58:01,090
Right. Or you can find the other way around.

579
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:05,209
I mean, too much of something is not good either, right? I mean, in addition, it happens.

580
00:58:05,210 --> 00:58:08,720
So then because you enter the toxicity levels, right?

581
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:17,000
So you get to match, you can also get sick. So then if you are here, then maybe you also can find some differences with the optimal intake.

582
00:58:17,810 --> 00:58:25,880
But most people are actually here in the optimal range of intake.

583
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:33,709
The association is flat. So I mean you can see kind of like I mean sometimes with something semi you may see like,

584
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:37,550
oh yo, you take a little more, maybe you see kind of like some or the other way around.

585
00:58:37,790 --> 00:58:43,759
This is a ratio is kind of like some protection, right. But but many times you can see absolutely anything.

586
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:46,190
And that doesn't mean that the nutrient is not good for you.

587
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:51,440
It's just that you are taking the optimal range and all your population that are in the optimal range.

588
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:55,150
So then you don't see differences and then you can see association with something.

589
00:58:55,190 --> 00:59:00,950
Not because the nutrient is not important for that disease is because people are having what they have to have.

590
00:59:01,190 --> 00:59:06,020
Right. So you have to think about that when you interpret also no results, right?

591
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:12,930
You see no results and you feel like, oh, there's nothing with this. No, that, no, maybe your population is perfectly okay balancing that nutrient.

592
00:59:12,950 --> 00:59:22,939
Right. Okay. So, so they depositional doesn't mean associations maybe because the variation in that is sufficient.

593
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:31,640
They are in that or they are there's variation, but they are in the flat portion of the of the curve, which is what happened to us.

594
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:39,110
Like, for example, this is this is something they did a long time ago. This is alpha linolenic acid measured in adipose tissue.

595
00:59:39,110 --> 00:59:45,110
So this is a biomarker, but it is kind of like a good biomarker of it and this is their operation of him.

596
00:59:45,260 --> 00:59:51,380
And then you can see there's also another increases in the odds of a mild decreases spectacularly.

597
00:59:51,470 --> 01:00:00,320
Right, which is kind of a. Wow. And then when you do this in in I mean, this this was done in Costa Rica or low middle income country.

598
01:00:00,590 --> 01:00:09,850
When you do that in other kind of Western countries, like the U.S. or whatever, you don't see anything like Alpha Linolenic that's in that for me.

599
01:00:10,250 --> 01:00:20,660
Why? Well, maybe because what happen is that you look at this, maybe in these countries like in the U.S., you are in this part of the of the quarter,

600
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:27,700
like most people that have a high intake of linolenic because it comes from soybean oil, that soybean oil is very weak.

601
01:00:27,710 --> 01:00:30,910
It is here in the U.S. because it's used in everything. Right.

602
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:33,530
I mean, but in Costa Rica,

603
01:00:33,530 --> 01:00:41,749
what happened is that you had many people in this part of the of the globe efficient enough because instead of cooking with soybean oil,

604
01:00:41,750 --> 01:00:43,940
they were cooking with palm oil. Right.

605
01:00:44,270 --> 01:00:52,190
So then you have to think about the context in every country is different and whenever you can live with something,

606
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:56,570
you have to know about your study population and understand what they usually eat.

607
01:00:56,690 --> 01:00:56,959
Right.

608
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:05,300
Because otherwise sometimes, I mean, those comparisons in different countries come completely, you know, contradictory and they are not contradictory.

609
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:09,020
You think about the context. Okay, so you will have to think about that.

610
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:17,479
Um, and the other things that the granularity shows is that, I mean, the measurement error over,

611
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:27,440
they said that or they know statistically that they may be or saw differences in a temporal relationship like for example, of the Centers for Cancer.

612
01:01:27,890 --> 01:01:33,470
What matters is your maybe your exposure as a child or even in the womb.

613
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:39,080
Right. So so no, no, not your most recent exposure doesn't affect the risk of cancer.

614
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:42,560
Right? But something that you will then usually then ask.

615
01:01:43,010 --> 01:01:46,580
And of course, there's always all types of biases on and off on here.

616
01:01:47,510 --> 01:01:52,490
Okay. And then I'm finishing with this and then I'll give you I'll give you a break.

617
01:01:53,000 --> 01:02:01,159
So so this is something that was published in the New England Journal of Medicine, um, already ten years ago.

618
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:08,720
But I love it. We think the relationship between chocolate consumption and Nobel Prize.

619
01:02:09,410 --> 01:02:14,420
So then you can see that you put all the countries here and you can see the Swiss.

620
01:02:14,510 --> 01:02:18,260
Switzerland is the one that is going to make it to the top because they have a

621
01:02:18,260 --> 01:02:21,860
lot of Nobel laureates and but also they have a high chocolate consumption.

622
01:02:21,860 --> 01:02:27,360
And you can see that the relationship is pretty linear within the medical profession of almost point 80,

623
01:02:27,380 --> 01:02:32,390
which is like, well, we should all eat chocolate, right? Because that will make us really smart.

624
01:02:32,990 --> 01:02:37,270
So what's the problem with this type of decision? Which type of design is this?

625
01:02:40,330 --> 01:02:44,620
Ecological ecological was the problem that few brewers.

626
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:52,340
It's not looking at individual level data. So you could have just.

627
01:02:54,970 --> 01:02:58,360
And there's sort of so many other components being put in there.

628
01:02:58,390 --> 01:03:04,870
So you're not measuring like you don't know whether the people who are eating the most chocolate are actually the smartest ones.

629
01:03:04,930 --> 01:03:08,350
It's like a lot of smart people and. Exactly.

630
01:03:08,350 --> 01:03:12,249
That's ecologic fallacy, right? What other things? There's another thing.

631
01:03:12,250 --> 01:03:16,210
Important. Go fund me.

632
01:03:16,630 --> 01:03:23,050
So it can be kind of like the something that actually that is associated that maybe this is not chocolate consumption and

633
01:03:23,050 --> 01:03:29,680
maybe this is kind of like other types of things like higher education that is associated with much attention or whatever.

634
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:32,680
Right? So, so yeah. So this, this actually was a joke.

635
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:35,760
This was not really a serious I like article.

636
01:03:35,770 --> 01:03:45,909
So that was actually published to show the problems of the ecology ecology class in there and they brought on there and ecological studies anyway.

637
01:03:45,910 --> 01:03:56,050
So but my last minion I mean and then I you have any questions of this first part.

638
01:03:57,100 --> 01:04:07,600
So let's take a short break and yeah, and then we will move into SAS.

639
01:04:07,630 --> 01:04:11,170
So if you feel fine with SAS, you can leave, okay?

640
01:04:11,170 --> 01:04:15,160
If you feel like you want to stay, then. Okay, 5 minutes.

641
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:50,520
Hi. So it's.

642
01:04:54,260 --> 01:05:16,560
That's. That.

643
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:26,850
You have to do something.

644
01:05:27,450 --> 01:05:43,560
It's all in there. But I'm here to tell you that if you are part of this project.

645
01:05:44,700 --> 01:06:11,140
Chris, thank you for. Therefore, I want to extend your stay for the show and let me go down to the hotel.

646
01:06:20,310 --> 01:06:26,770
You. Tell us.

647
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:36,090
You know, this one was.

648
01:06:38,430 --> 01:06:43,670
The hands of people like.

649
01:06:49,340 --> 01:07:06,670
How do you go about doing this?

650
01:07:17,830 --> 01:07:26,400
I'm very sorry for that.

651
01:07:28,220 --> 01:07:38,600
I just really I think that, you know, it's one.

652
01:07:45,610 --> 01:07:48,680
But it's not going to.

653
01:07:55,700 --> 01:08:18,349
Until recently it was what I would call at home in the household.

654
01:08:18,350 --> 01:08:33,410
So we have to continue to do that.

655
01:08:35,170 --> 01:08:59,910
I've. So what about?

656
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:25,080
You. And.

657
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:55,720
You don't have to learn to.

658
01:09:59,210 --> 01:10:29,670
So. I know that he is pretty well off.

659
01:10:36,230 --> 01:10:59,750
But you probably learned something from watching.

660
01:11:02,780 --> 01:11:07,930
Was such.

661
01:11:18,580 --> 01:11:28,050
Make. Okay.

662
01:11:28,220 --> 01:11:36,800
Let's start because we have a lot to about when all of you are able to watch the recordings now.

663
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:42,860
Okay. So while the recordings are there, always in case you want to go play chicken.

664
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:49,100
Okay, so then I'll go. I'm using the same kind of like as lines that it was in the recordings.

665
01:11:49,970 --> 01:11:56,480
So the first thing is that here you you should have source installed in the computers.

666
01:11:56,480 --> 01:12:03,410
I think it probably we need to renew the license to say well when did they cannot do though they're very deep person.

667
01:12:10,260 --> 01:12:13,560
Can you can you open source, all of you. Are you can leave now.

668
01:12:16,350 --> 01:12:21,120
And can you try to see if you can open source in your computers?

669
01:12:21,150 --> 01:12:22,690
Yes. Okay.

670
01:12:22,890 --> 01:12:35,250
So so then when you are at home on another part of I mean, if you are not here in the computer lab, you may need to access through the trust site.

671
01:12:37,260 --> 01:12:41,310
Do you also you know how to access with the sites? Yes.

672
01:12:41,370 --> 01:12:48,720
Right. Okay. Good. Because as I say, I mean, for new units, new students, but for new things, sometimes that's a little problematic,

673
01:12:48,930 --> 01:12:54,960
not not accessing that, which is kind of like a safer way, but kind of like having access to your files, right.

674
01:12:54,970 --> 01:12:58,330
On the. You have to have your files in the cloud, right?

675
01:12:58,350 --> 01:13:07,140
Or in any type of cloud. So then you're going to like directory to call your SO the rest will be probably a K greatly, probably.

676
01:13:08,220 --> 01:13:13,770
But again, not very. I don't know about everything. I'm like another one, but it's okay.

677
01:13:14,100 --> 01:13:20,100
So. So I'll show you badly. Okay. So then we will we are going to deal with this.

678
01:13:21,090 --> 01:13:27,090
I'm going to go very quickly on the SAS environment and basics of SAS coding, but I think you know a little bit about that.

679
01:13:27,390 --> 01:13:35,100
I'm going to focus on the in the library because that's how little kind of life that's one of those things that sun cell, you forget.

680
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:41,310
And then this is very important and then some of the basics of the directive and then create new variables and then we'll go

681
01:13:41,580 --> 01:13:47,270
into some of the procedures and probably going to step the logic operations because you're probably going to yourselves.

682
01:13:49,050 --> 01:13:53,730
So for that, you have a handout in a way, and you know how to do it, I guess.

683
01:13:54,270 --> 01:13:57,270
So then let's go to the CC environment on that.

684
01:13:57,270 --> 01:14:01,920
So. So when you open source, do you see those three windows?

685
01:14:02,130 --> 01:14:10,080
Right. And can you open and you can see. Right. So those windows can be and wouldn't be good.

686
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:15,330
And then kind of like you're I mean, by default, this is the way that it opens that you can change them.

687
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:19,020
Right. So the idea is that in the editor,

688
01:14:19,830 --> 01:14:31,950
this is where you basically type your coding or you can when you open source file that has already there the code in

689
01:14:31,950 --> 01:14:39,190
that usually we have the extension is a is like usually not always the way to want open it will it will open here.

690
01:14:39,210 --> 01:14:42,780
So then if I, I, I gave you this.

691
01:14:44,370 --> 01:14:51,410
Let me show you. You have this in Kansas.

692
01:14:51,430 --> 01:15:02,880
Then you can open it and then you can see it here. Okay. So then you have all the all the everything for this dust that we're going to do here.

693
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:06,190
Right. So you already have that. All you have to write for this match. Okay.

694
01:15:06,790 --> 01:15:11,070
So can you can you open that? All of you. Okay.

695
01:15:12,190 --> 01:15:19,329
Then you know that in the love window, many people tend to ignore the long window because sometimes the messages are like,

696
01:15:19,330 --> 01:15:24,340
okay, I mean, here is just telling you that they said they need this to renew, which is not your business.

697
01:15:24,340 --> 01:15:31,810
Right. So and sometimes, I mean, when you run so their faces like, I mean, so sometimes if you like with messages.

698
01:15:32,170 --> 01:15:42,040
But the thing here is that to remember that they call or cold enough sass when you see things in in in black and blue,

699
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:44,590
everything goes fine, more or less right.

700
01:15:45,100 --> 01:15:51,700
When you see things in green, greener worries, not necessarily that something is wrong, that something is kind of like fishy.

701
01:15:51,700 --> 01:15:55,390
I mean, this case, the warning is because of the safety net, which is not relevant.

702
01:15:55,600 --> 01:16:04,690
But sometimes you may get a warning that says run the procedure by the realizes that one variable is zero in one category.

703
01:16:04,690 --> 01:16:09,519
So then is telling you that the best one be that one, be accurate five or something like that.

704
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:15,390
So then you paid attention to that. And then when you make mistakes that SAS doesn't understand anything, then you will get that right.

705
01:16:15,690 --> 01:16:18,580
Right. Right is kind of like, you know, I mean, something is wrong.

706
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:25,180
Okay, so, so pay attention to that because sometimes the message you get from SAS is very clear.

707
01:16:25,210 --> 01:16:31,900
That said, oh yeah, I made a mistake that there is no I forgot to kind of like open the dataset or use the data is

708
01:16:31,900 --> 01:16:35,920
telling you there is no dataset call like that and these because you forgot to change the name.

709
01:16:36,270 --> 01:16:41,110
It seems like that. Right? But sometimes their messages can be a very obscure right,

710
01:16:41,110 --> 01:16:47,409
particularly when you forget like a semicolon or something like that, that this is kind of line of within the code.

711
01:16:47,410 --> 01:16:52,030
Well, then it will give you some error messages that you won't be able to do that.

712
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:57,010
But go back to your code and check. Make sure that the code is correct.

713
01:16:57,220 --> 01:17:04,410
Right. If if after trying to find if you don't find anything, then again what I told you before, don't spend it.

714
01:17:04,420 --> 01:17:07,540
Spend 2 hours trying to find out what's wrong. Yeah.

715
01:17:07,550 --> 01:17:10,660
Send me a message. Okay. Okay, so that's.

716
01:17:10,660 --> 01:17:16,930
That's the main thing. And then once you have something, you will find it in the output, right?

717
01:17:16,930 --> 01:17:23,379
So then once you run something that has output, you will get it in the up here you have the your library.

718
01:17:23,380 --> 01:17:32,140
So here, by the way, by default, libraries are set up when you have to create your library and this is everything you need to know.

719
01:17:33,610 --> 01:17:38,740
And the other important things here are the this that let me go back here.

720
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:44,559
This is very important because this is the the the dummy that you had to to give to run.

721
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:50,230
So do you everytime you want to run something you've highlighted and then you run that right.

722
01:17:51,820 --> 01:17:59,110
And then these are the normal kind of like a icons that you have for printing say save, save your work.

723
01:17:59,110 --> 01:18:08,290
I mean basically that particular you are working in with site with a bunch of sites because which ISIS tends to give you off sandbanks,

724
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:12,370
that's very annoying. So they didn't want to lose all your order. Order. Right.

725
01:18:12,610 --> 01:18:17,980
And this is why you you also have your programs and so on. When you open the programs, remember that.

726
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:28,090
Yeah. I don't have anything, but I'm assuming that this is this, for example, is there if space or this will be like a cloud.

727
01:18:28,100 --> 01:18:37,880
But the one that I have at home, I have my, my, my drop box.

728
01:18:38,150 --> 01:18:42,900
Okay. And then so then that will be like, okay, okay.

729
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:47,090
Kind of like thing for here.

730
01:18:47,090 --> 01:18:51,920
I'm going to copy the files in the hard disk, so then it will see that.

731
01:18:52,490 --> 01:19:10,240
Okay. Okay. So, so then I already kind of like explain this and then think about I mean, Seth always has kind of like this type of structure, right?

732
01:19:10,250 --> 01:19:20,389
So kind of like in the beginning you have some instructions like the leave name that those you need those to process to find your dataset.

733
01:19:20,390 --> 01:19:26,330
And that's really important, right? Because this is I mean, it's not like, oh, that it's not that friendly in that sense.

734
01:19:26,330 --> 01:19:28,370
I mean, you really need to specify the, the,

735
01:19:28,730 --> 01:19:37,820
the library name and then usually you have some data steps in which you take your dataset and sometimes you modify the value granularity of all.

736
01:19:37,820 --> 01:19:45,260
So you kind of like subset to, let's say you want to do there is that I mean you have a study that have adults and children.

737
01:19:45,350 --> 01:19:50,299
You want to do only the children. So then you have to set your director to only children, for example.

738
01:19:50,300 --> 01:19:54,260
Right? And then finally you have your preschooler steps, all of them.

739
01:19:54,290 --> 01:20:04,880
They start with a thing, right? And and then those are kind of like some basics of sounds that you have to be very careful.

740
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:12,830
The semicolons complete each line of code and each line of code you can you can put one line of code in three.

741
01:20:13,220 --> 01:20:16,400
As long as you don't put a semicolon will still be a line of code.

742
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:23,599
Right. So don't get confused with that. So then that that's actually I use what sorts of errors because sometimes you have something like that,

743
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:26,990
maybe you can put semicolons in, but you show them, right?

744
01:20:27,260 --> 01:20:29,200
So then it says ones.

745
01:20:29,630 --> 01:20:35,480
But for us it's very important to see the semicolon because otherwise you won't be able to record it, will mix it with the next thing, right?

746
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:41,799
The one scene at the end of the block will trigger the execution of the data.

747
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:48,950
All the block step. Right. So then I even though you can put many things together, I mean, just one right at the end,

748
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:53,540
I would recommend you to kind of like put a run after every block, right?

749
01:20:53,570 --> 01:20:55,309
And then you can run them separately, right?

750
01:20:55,310 --> 01:21:03,590
Because if you don't put a run, even if you push that, they're running dummy in one run like you need to run kind of messy.

751
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:10,759
And then one thing that SAS has that is nice is that Apple or it gave us a month, right?

752
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:16,640
So you can you can use run, run or run ratio if that's a monitor that good.

753
01:21:17,090 --> 01:21:19,090
But it matters for you. Right.

754
01:21:19,100 --> 01:21:26,839
So then because I mean, remember that your programs need to be readable, right, for you and for other people that may be using them, right?

755
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:34,960
So they kind of like truth. I mean, don't change capital capitaland kind of like an arbitrary location.

756
01:21:34,970 --> 01:21:38,510
The time I mean, in between, right. Because that's that's not really nice.

757
01:21:38,510 --> 01:21:47,360
Right. Or be very organized. I mean, it's good to be organized and your air quality and also data dump proximus must be complete.

758
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:51,680
They you're going to have a problem with innovative, stable things that I forgot to say.

759
01:21:51,690 --> 01:21:56,870
But if you have a data set or you have fabric, right? So, so let's have them like the basics.

760
01:21:56,870 --> 01:22:05,929
The basics, basics. Now let's go to the to the to the limit I mean table how you name variables.

761
01:22:05,930 --> 01:22:10,579
Census says there are certain words that won't work.

762
01:22:10,580 --> 01:22:13,670
Like for example, you cannot start with a number.

763
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:18,860
You cannot put like a dot here because all the way says will be confused.

764
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:20,800
You're going to put a space,

765
01:22:20,810 --> 01:22:27,469
you see that and then you're going to put a there certain characters that says doesn't like like for example, this is commission.

766
01:22:27,470 --> 01:22:32,480
I don't remember the whole list, but there are a few. So just limit your variable names to something that is just lower.

767
01:22:32,510 --> 01:22:35,749
Right limit on numbers on the numbers must be at the end.

768
01:22:35,750 --> 01:22:36,889
Not at the beginning. Okay.

769
01:22:36,890 --> 01:22:44,870
And you can, but you need to put something that like a space to kind of like make sure that your variable makes sense, then use the underscore.

770
01:22:45,140 --> 01:22:50,299
Okay. So then for simple for being made to facility, those would be pretty good options.

771
01:22:50,300 --> 01:22:54,890
Those are not good. This is not that important in the sense that oh yeah, those are they special.

772
01:22:56,180 --> 01:22:59,210
So those don't use any of those in your model names.

773
01:23:00,290 --> 01:23:05,480
This is not that important to remember because if you use then SAS is going to tell you it's going to give you an error.

774
01:23:05,690 --> 01:23:09,950
Right? So then you will notice that. Oh yeah, no, that's not that's not how it works.

775
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:19,220
Now one of the most important thing is, remember, they deliver name, they stay right and see that, for example.

776
01:23:20,870 --> 01:23:25,880
And put in like two lines of gold, but it's only a one lane because it ends in this semicolon, right?

777
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:35,840
I mean, we put it there because of design issues that the designer decided to put to bed in doing so the the lovely statement,

778
01:23:35,990 --> 01:23:42,220
use the lead name he was. Then you have to put the name of the library, which is up to you.

779
01:23:42,230 --> 01:23:47,000
You can call it whatever. He had a column this year for this card.

780
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:51,530
You can use note 6 to 2 for writing. I mean, but use whatever you want.

781
01:23:52,070 --> 01:23:59,000
And then the most important part is this, right? Then you have to put the system folder in your computer, the whole purpose.

782
01:23:59,480 --> 01:24:09,650
So here is very easy because this one is in the C drive for the hard disk and then I only have this folder ever 6r2 and then the in the lab.

783
01:24:09,740 --> 01:24:15,860
Right. But sometimes you can have like for example the one that I have, you can see here.

784
01:24:16,070 --> 01:24:21,780
I mean, can you see this? No, I know I can't either.

785
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:33,660
So let me see. You know, spaghetti with.

786
01:24:54,270 --> 01:24:58,200
Do you remember when I can change the font size?

787
01:25:08,180 --> 01:25:15,600
Yet. MODERATOR.

788
01:25:15,650 --> 01:25:19,100
Right. Okay. Okay.

789
01:25:19,100 --> 01:25:22,660
So see here, let me make this also.

790
01:25:23,330 --> 01:25:31,310
Yeah. So see, like, for example, what I want, I have this is an ad lib name.

791
01:25:32,060 --> 01:25:37,340
This is my library. When I created it at home, for example, I use that right because that's my Dropbox.

792
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:43,600
And then this is my whole kind of like folder, which is the defaults in folder then on me.

793
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:47,030
You can do it. You were it really alone.

794
01:25:47,030 --> 01:25:57,950
But right. So and you have to be very careful here because if in your folder there is one dot space in there,

795
01:25:57,950 --> 01:26:03,500
you have to put it exactly because you put one dot and you forget the space, then sass one find it.

796
01:26:03,510 --> 01:26:09,440
So and in this situation, actually the uppercase and lowercase is important.

797
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:15,740
So in the rest of the parameter, no. But in there that, by the way, has to be exactly as it was created originally.

798
01:26:15,750 --> 01:26:15,950
Right.

799
01:26:16,310 --> 01:26:27,200
So, Don, don't be that kind of like I mean, just do something simple, like, for example, and here I'm using this one, right, for like valuation.

800
01:26:30,930 --> 01:26:36,360
This is what makes it so. So let's run this.

801
01:26:39,820 --> 01:26:40,660
And it should work.

802
01:26:41,620 --> 01:26:51,370
And there you see here that is is running my line of God and is telling me that was successfully a safe look, which is good in blue, no red, nothing.

803
01:26:51,370 --> 01:26:55,710
So that's good. So now I can go here and I can see if he had already see.

804
01:26:56,530 --> 01:27:00,220
And then if I click here, I can see that here. My, the latter is here.

805
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:08,680
So my data set physically is in this in this fallen in the hard drive of this hard disk.

806
01:27:08,770 --> 01:27:13,390
Right. But Seth needs to kind of like create that.

807
01:27:14,860 --> 01:27:22,990
I don't know how to call it maybe like a virtual virtual library ratio kind of like.

808
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:27,210
And this library is a permanent library.

809
01:27:27,220 --> 01:27:32,180
But I because my, my, my, my type of, my library is not permanent.

810
01:27:32,180 --> 01:27:35,540
Let me do delete. It won't be there. But there, there.

811
01:27:35,620 --> 01:27:38,770
I said this permanent. Right. So then I create the library.

812
01:27:39,070 --> 01:27:44,110
If I work with that temporary that I said we will see that later and you don't

813
01:27:45,700 --> 01:27:50,649
keep it in a permanent that I said then you will lose that data once you process.

814
01:27:50,650 --> 01:27:53,740
So be careful with that. We will see that in a way.

815
01:27:56,640 --> 01:28:03,450
Okay. So so there's a library and then this is what I.

816
01:28:03,780 --> 01:28:11,819
Okay, so the permanent library is just that that one was created and then these are temporary says library for the temporary that S-E-X,

817
01:28:11,820 --> 01:28:14,880
which is their work life. Right. So if I go here.

818
01:28:19,620 --> 01:28:21,540
I don't have anything here. Right.

819
01:28:21,900 --> 01:28:32,300
But if I am going to create if I want to do this this and want to create a temporary that I set from from the library.

820
01:28:32,310 --> 01:28:37,469
So my suspect is I want to create a temporary asset, which is going to be called the same.

821
01:28:37,470 --> 01:28:41,820
But I quickly define everybody and I think I said that doesn't matter.

822
01:28:42,120 --> 01:28:51,050
So this is kind of like this is telling stuff fake my permanent dataset that is into this library and then create and copy.

823
01:28:51,060 --> 01:28:54,800
I know the one that is going to be temporary and it's going to be called suspect.

824
01:28:55,320 --> 01:29:02,100
Right. So that one, when everyone does that, one is going to appear here.

825
01:29:02,610 --> 01:29:02,930
Right.

826
01:29:02,940 --> 01:29:13,799
So this is you can always double click and check visually, but always remember to close them because if you want to use the data set and that's open,

827
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:17,450
then says is going to give you an option, always remember to divide.

828
01:29:17,820 --> 01:29:22,920
So now I have I have to I can also change the name and I can do as I have.

829
01:29:23,670 --> 01:29:27,210
And then it will create another one. They are identical, but they are different.

830
01:29:27,510 --> 01:29:35,010
Note that now I have to suspect this one in their temporary in their temporary library.

831
01:29:35,160 --> 01:29:38,910
But I also have another one in the permanent.

832
01:29:39,630 --> 01:29:43,110
Right. So those are different. This is permanent.

833
01:29:43,110 --> 01:29:46,970
This one be deleted once you process because that's physically in there,

834
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:56,939
are these going to go out but this one this one will disappear once your process right so when working with

835
01:29:56,940 --> 01:30:04,229
temporary that assets be careful if you want to keep that at the end you do the up the reverse thing right.

836
01:30:04,230 --> 01:30:10,379
So kind of like let's see that you've been I mean creating a temporary that I said because

837
01:30:10,380 --> 01:30:14,550
you will be thinking why do I create a temporary that I say just work with the permanent,

838
01:30:14,550 --> 01:30:15,420
which is perfectly fine.

839
01:30:15,780 --> 01:30:22,110
But sometimes when you have to do a face to the permanent that I said you the one sent out, you made mistakes and they do all that right.

840
01:30:23,130 --> 01:30:28,350
You can mess up with a permanent did I it and something you don't want to do that that's why you create a

841
01:30:28,350 --> 01:30:33,600
temporary so you can do everything in the temporary and then if things are okay and you want to keep them,

842
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:40,860
but what you want to do is to to do the other way around, you know.

843
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:49,710
I'm not going to lie because I want to write anything. But now you will be all the way around.

844
01:30:49,730 --> 01:30:56,000
So now I imagine that in between I created many new what I wrote in this temporary practice.

845
01:30:56,360 --> 01:30:59,310
But now I want to give it a permanent so then I can apply.

846
01:30:59,330 --> 01:31:04,670
First of all, take my temporary and then create the permanent magnet again, possibly the same.

847
01:31:04,670 --> 01:31:09,170
I can call it another way. So you can use any time that you use the same name.

848
01:31:09,470 --> 01:31:17,000
So this is going to write the original one. So then you will keep a new permanent reset that will have everything due to the temporary.

849
01:31:17,690 --> 01:31:20,929
Okay. Is everything clear on my.

850
01:31:20,930 --> 01:31:24,980
Been going to lay a lot of back and forth. Yes.

851
01:31:27,110 --> 01:31:32,480
Yes. When I run through like the living things that serve as a library.

852
01:31:35,220 --> 01:31:41,870
That's incest. Yeah, it may be a problem with your past, because sometimes it's like something they should discuss.

853
01:31:42,510 --> 01:31:46,650
So what did you have there? What do you do if you don't go to them?

854
01:31:47,080 --> 01:31:56,850
They're five. So I need to think are so this is there is no on the back of a photograph, but the one I put in was part of which I copied from here.

855
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:04,480
Yeah, I. This.

856
01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:10,020
I can't remember how. My mother.

857
01:32:23,720 --> 01:32:30,230
Believe it or not, you know, you the more the innocent is, the better.

858
01:32:30,680 --> 01:32:42,420
As for the big island yet. Was right to the accent and.

859
01:32:55,520 --> 01:33:00,460
Okay. Okay.

860
01:33:00,860 --> 01:33:05,030
So let me go back to where we were.

861
01:33:06,170 --> 01:33:13,040
Okay. So so now you can see that now when you use that that asset, if it's a permanent that I said,

862
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:19,430
you need to always specify the label name the library name first and followed by a dot.

863
01:33:19,700 --> 01:33:24,620
If it's a temporary, you then need to specify it. And in theory it will be work, right?

864
01:33:24,620 --> 01:33:28,270
But by default it isn't even the work. It will be okay.

865
01:33:28,430 --> 01:33:41,360
It says we understand that I say temporary that I said, okay, so let's move into doing this to kind of like have a few years of lessons.

866
01:33:42,410 --> 01:33:49,940
So basically the there I said the template is burlap which says the name of the new.

867
01:33:49,940 --> 01:33:55,969
Then I said after manipulation set, which tells us where to get the original data to start with,

868
01:33:55,970 --> 01:33:59,990
which I will never understand why they've even put it in their order because it makes

869
01:33:59,990 --> 01:34:04,790
more sense of this one and they make this one and we make this one from this one.

870
01:34:04,790 --> 01:34:09,710
Right. But that's how it is. Right? And then here you have everything you want.

871
01:34:09,890 --> 01:34:13,420
You want to create new whatever you want to kind of like have said that.

872
01:34:13,490 --> 01:34:18,620
I said all the potential things you can do another step and always remember to finish with your right.

873
01:34:18,620 --> 01:34:24,680
Right. So that that makes it like an individual thing that you can write independently of all that part of the code.

874
01:34:26,680 --> 01:34:30,260
So how do you create new variables?

875
01:34:30,280 --> 01:34:33,609
I mean, there are many ways of doing that,

876
01:34:33,610 --> 01:34:38,890
but the most common one always is using some type of kind of like if then a statement

877
01:34:39,250 --> 01:34:44,229
and some type of kind of like their usual logic to kind of like create neural networks.

878
01:34:44,230 --> 01:34:49,770
Like a typical example here is that you have BMI is a variable continuous and then you,

879
01:34:49,990 --> 01:35:01,210
you want to create a new categorical binary variable that is going to be called obesity and you're going to use the cutoff of 30 BMI as BMI.

880
01:35:01,630 --> 01:35:05,320
Greater equal or greater than 30 will be one.

881
01:35:05,440 --> 01:35:09,339
That would mean people are obese or below will be seated.

882
01:35:09,340 --> 01:35:13,480
I mean, people are not obese. I mean, they may still be overweight. Right. But you're just creating a binary.

883
01:35:13,780 --> 01:35:23,890
Right. And be physical. So then basically you just if my view would be a minus one equal to 30, then obesity equals one.

884
01:35:24,430 --> 01:35:29,380
And then you put us on a white or we could be equals zero, right?

885
01:35:29,740 --> 01:35:33,430
So that's the most basic code that you're going to use. All right.

886
01:35:33,730 --> 01:35:37,030
And for this class model, you are allowed to use more than that.

887
01:35:37,120 --> 01:35:43,180
And I said, don't don't worry too much. I won't kind of like bothered that some friends here I have this.

888
01:35:43,780 --> 01:35:53,319
Now, one of the things that you can do definitely is to kind of like drop variables or keep variables, right?

889
01:35:53,320 --> 01:35:59,140
Or and note that in SAS there are many ways of doing the same thing.

890
01:35:59,860 --> 01:36:02,920
Right? So it's okay. Just use the one that you're familiar with.

891
01:36:02,950 --> 01:36:07,450
I mean, sometimes things will be shorter and more elegant, which is okay.

892
01:36:07,450 --> 01:36:12,249
I mean, this is not best for kind of like being the most elegant.

893
01:36:12,250 --> 01:36:15,970
So then just do whatever you feel more comfortable with, right?

894
01:36:16,210 --> 01:36:20,140
So it's okay to kind of like do several data steps instead of everything.

895
01:36:20,140 --> 01:36:25,090
Another step is to use the whatever code you feel more comfortable, even if it's longer.

896
01:36:25,180 --> 01:36:29,709
Okay. So, so in this situation where we have to do that,

897
01:36:29,710 --> 01:36:39,700
we have that data set and then we want to create a new that I said the has only I mean we get rid of de vitamin E so we just drop those Y

898
01:36:39,710 --> 01:36:47,800
that will support those and then we end up with a that I said with only those two variables we could actually do the same complementary.

899
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:56,380
So instead of don't say skip. So is that a drop in the four variables that we put before we both keep the ones that we want to keep?

900
01:36:57,160 --> 01:37:00,730
Now, when do you use skip or drop depending on the number of whatever?

901
01:37:01,180 --> 01:37:05,600
Right. So in this situation, keep will be better because you only want to keep two.

902
01:37:05,620 --> 01:37:07,660
So then you only have to write two variables.

903
01:37:08,080 --> 01:37:13,840
But in other situations where you have a thousand variables and you only want to drop for rate, you will use that.

904
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:18,040
All right. So that's kind of like you just used your s, right?

905
01:37:19,900 --> 01:37:24,100
You can also kind of like set the observations, right?

906
01:37:24,430 --> 01:37:29,919
So kind of like that. For example, in this situation we have of ratios from that.

907
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:36,990
Can you see one, two. Right. Or should I because I know it.

908
01:37:37,010 --> 01:37:46,440
Nice. Very nice. Okay. So here for a sample we had the original dataset, had information, have repeated observations for the same review.

909
01:37:46,470 --> 01:37:51,370
You have the one and they do and they set up for the idea to the one they do and so on.

910
01:37:51,370 --> 01:37:58,180
Right. And then you only want to keep the one for whatever reason and actually you're going to do it next week for your lab.

911
01:37:58,540 --> 01:38:09,159
Like so then in order to keep only the ones I used to have where the statement one day equals one this week you can be also an equal sign.

912
01:38:09,160 --> 01:38:17,140
So that's the other thing says sometimes and the the some of the sides also have an equivalent in one.

913
01:38:17,200 --> 01:38:20,440
So you can use whichever you've been looking for. Okay.

914
01:38:25,040 --> 01:38:33,020
All you can do. It's very similar, but not like like a negative thing, right?

915
01:38:33,410 --> 01:38:39,960
If they face not equal to one, then they delete, which is the same as if they equal one.

916
01:38:40,030 --> 01:38:42,259
Right. So it's kind of like you're getting the same results,

917
01:38:42,260 --> 01:38:48,710
but in a kind of like instead of kind of like where they equals one, you could use an F experiment.

918
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:56,120
So if they're not equal to one, then. Right. So see, I mean, you are doing exactly the same thing, but with two different goals.

919
01:38:56,660 --> 01:38:59,840
So use the ones that you feel like it doesn't.

920
01:39:00,380 --> 01:39:05,240
All of them are perfectly correct. Okay, so let's go to test one.

921
01:39:05,960 --> 01:39:15,620
So that's one you have to. Oh, probably we have already done that.

922
01:39:15,620 --> 01:39:19,040
Right. So we have the we have created the library. Right.

923
01:39:19,490 --> 01:39:23,750
And you have to create the the body again. Right. So no has done that already.

924
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:29,210
Yes. Okay. So then there's more. There's more we can do faster.

925
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:37,909
Okay. So now we have we are able to create new variables. We are ready so that this day, this one.

926
01:39:37,910 --> 01:39:46,610
Right, we are ready. So the if then else is kind of like the most basic one that you're going to be using all the best.

927
01:39:47,810 --> 01:39:50,900
But we can.

928
01:39:52,520 --> 01:40:01,040
So I don't know. But we can do something not only binary like three categories, right?

929
01:40:01,040 --> 01:40:05,330
So then you have those, then you use your f elseif else, right?

930
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:08,060
And again, this, this is all that you can do.

931
01:40:08,070 --> 01:40:15,250
Something really cool can be you can, you could actually use a lot of if that is statements instead of this.

932
01:40:15,250 --> 01:40:27,110
So you could put if color is more than 2000 they got equal to you could actually say if colored is more than 1000 then calc equals one.

933
01:40:27,110 --> 01:40:30,830
And if galleries I don't remember.

934
01:40:30,870 --> 01:40:39,919
I mean, you can you can you can you want to create this in kind of like larger than 2000, 1000, 2000 or 1000.

935
01:40:39,920 --> 01:40:43,910
You could do it. Let me show you. You could do it this way.

936
01:40:47,230 --> 01:40:52,990
I know we have to do something different here. Let me show you this.

937
01:40:53,500 --> 01:40:57,819
Let me see. This is. Okay. That's what.

938
01:40:57,820 --> 01:41:02,379
I don't know you to do it this way. Or you could do it with this even in the statements.

939
01:41:02,380 --> 01:41:10,480
But then in between, you have to specify if color is more than 1000 and less than 2000,

940
01:41:10,780 --> 01:41:16,420
or if calories are less than 1000 and more than zero, for example.

941
01:41:16,900 --> 01:41:18,690
So then you've got that equal to zero.

942
01:41:18,700 --> 01:41:25,570
So then again, there are different ways of this is this is a little more elegant because it takes everything into account,

943
01:41:25,900 --> 01:41:29,920
but you can use only if you forgot about the elseif or whatever.

944
01:41:30,190 --> 01:41:38,649
Then you can, yes, use event statements as long as being careful that your categories don't overlap the others.

945
01:41:38,650 --> 01:41:46,110
Right. So then that you have, you have to be very kind of like conscious about what are your categories.

946
01:41:46,120 --> 01:41:50,980
I mean, you want to and if it's 2000, if it's between 1000 to 30 and if it's below 1000,

947
01:41:51,220 --> 01:41:54,640
and make sure that everything is going to be indoors and you are not overlapping

948
01:41:54,820 --> 01:41:59,530
and be careful about that because the equal or greater has to be in one,

949
01:41:59,530 --> 01:42:08,349
but not in the other ratio than that. That if it's larger than 2000, means that that 2000 may be in the second category, 1933.

950
01:42:08,350 --> 01:42:13,090
So be careful of that, because four calories may not be a huge issue.

951
01:42:13,420 --> 01:42:20,659
But for certain things that have very specific cutoffs, you have to be kind of like consistent and follow the rules of whatever,

952
01:42:20,660 --> 01:42:27,010
regardless if it's if it's either of is contained in one category or in already before.

953
01:42:27,190 --> 01:42:31,390
Okay. So just just being careful out there, each one saying what you voted on.

954
01:42:31,720 --> 01:42:44,960
Okay. Also remember that the problem is that if you do have missing, you have to include also at category four,

955
01:42:44,970 --> 01:42:48,480
you have to kind of like recall the missing into missing again.

956
01:42:48,540 --> 01:42:51,690
Right, because otherwise you don't do that.

957
01:42:52,530 --> 01:42:57,090
So this is going to put that kind of like missing values in one of the categories.

958
01:42:57,240 --> 01:43:02,850
Okay. In the last one and you the one that you're the one that got the one I sense you need to do a value that you don't have the value.

959
01:43:02,850 --> 01:43:08,940
Right. So be careful out there missing. You have missing and remember, for missing size, use that dot.

960
01:43:09,450 --> 01:43:13,979
Then you have to add this as if the statement the values are missing.

961
01:43:13,980 --> 01:43:17,130
Then the new variable is going to be missing.

962
01:43:17,550 --> 01:43:23,070
Okay, so this is how you solve sort of error too, because it's very easy to forget about the missing.

963
01:43:26,100 --> 01:43:32,580
Okay. So as I told you, there are many ways of doing the same thing.

964
01:43:32,940 --> 01:43:37,410
This is a code that I like because it's so short and elegant for binary variables.

965
01:43:38,010 --> 01:43:44,610
So remember we were using this in the beginning for the binary radiograph obesity one zero.

966
01:43:45,030 --> 01:43:50,280
You can also use this one. So then you create a new variable that is called obesity.

967
01:43:50,370 --> 01:43:54,630
And then basically what by putting this in kind of like bracket.

968
01:43:55,200 --> 01:44:08,670
Then what sets this kind of like evaluating is, is that if BMI equals 30 is true, is going to call that as a one.

969
01:44:09,240 --> 01:44:13,560
And if it's false, if it kind of like is not true, is going to call that FICA.

970
01:44:14,160 --> 01:44:20,460
So this is kind of like a short and elegant way of creating binary variables when you have missing.

971
01:44:20,520 --> 01:44:24,690
Okay. Because if you have missing, then it will put your measures in there in this little body.

972
01:44:24,870 --> 01:44:31,200
Okay. So you have anything you would have to put that and you still have to do that with BMI when we see obesity.

973
01:44:32,100 --> 01:44:37,500
Okay. But you don't need to learn that this is kind of like this one way of doing things.

974
01:44:38,220 --> 01:44:44,410
Okay. So I'm going to go quickly on that because we have I will do.

975
01:44:45,180 --> 01:44:47,819
You can check this on your own because I mean, most likely, I mean,

976
01:44:47,820 --> 01:44:57,690
we are going to use a lot less than natural love because we will have to kind of like transform many of our nutrients and calories don't have I mean,

977
01:44:58,080 --> 01:45:01,200
nutrition calories never have negative values.

978
01:45:01,200 --> 01:45:06,230
Right. I mean, the lowest should be zero. So then they are always right, skew right.

979
01:45:06,570 --> 01:45:10,709
So then they are rarely normally distributed. So we would probably need to transform then.

980
01:45:10,710 --> 01:45:14,520
And one of the best kind of literature measures is the look transformation.

981
01:45:14,520 --> 01:45:21,030
So then we probably will use this fashion a lot, but other than that, the rest is kind of like that much.

982
01:45:24,840 --> 01:45:30,330
And then you have also these functions that we will really use in this class, but it's good to know.

983
01:45:33,900 --> 01:45:47,000
So let's let's do first two and three. So that tool, we are going to create a new continuous variable from the variables weight and height.

984
01:45:47,390 --> 01:45:56,090
Right. So then this, this weight is measured in kilograms and they say this mission is something we are going to have to do conversion.

985
01:45:56,090 --> 01:46:05,959
So you can apply these before and you know that the BMI is equal to the weight in kilograms divided by the height emitters to this weight ratio.

986
01:46:05,960 --> 01:46:09,980
Because your height is measuring centimeters, you will have two divided by 100.

987
01:46:10,400 --> 01:46:13,070
And then this thing will is weight, right?

988
01:46:13,520 --> 01:46:20,569
And when you apply kind of like this, that both means that you you have to be careful with the parentheses, okay?

989
01:46:20,570 --> 01:46:25,070
Because if you don't put the correct parentheses, you will end up with wrong information,

990
01:46:25,070 --> 01:46:29,240
which is this applies to any calculation you are doing initial right.

991
01:46:29,900 --> 01:46:33,020
So then they will be their way of creating the BMI variable.

992
01:46:33,020 --> 01:46:40,880
And then one nice thing to do is that when you create a new body, I want to know that I said it's always good to give them a label.

993
01:46:40,970 --> 01:46:47,540
Okay. So this is the label is they mean well, you can apply the labels go in in in what?

994
01:46:48,140 --> 01:46:51,770
And then you can see that they add in and bake.

995
01:46:52,040 --> 01:46:59,029
Right. So then, then whenever if I do that, then whenever I do a contents of the dataset,

996
01:46:59,030 --> 01:47:06,290
then I will have the label because I mean you can see that why should I create a label for being might be amazed all because that is BMI.

997
01:47:06,290 --> 01:47:12,439
Yeah, BMI. So obviously BMI by other variables you may not find out but I will name that is so descriptive right.

998
01:47:12,440 --> 01:47:17,120
So then is good to create labels. Okay. Okay.

999
01:47:17,120 --> 01:47:29,449
And then now that we we create this directly in my strategy so I create this and it's always good to see if you actually you can check here.

1000
01:47:29,450 --> 01:47:32,870
Right, and just have a glimpse and then you can see that.

1001
01:47:32,870 --> 01:47:38,389
Oh yeah, maybe in my money I will see it. And actually it has, it has values that look like BMI, right?

1002
01:47:38,390 --> 01:47:42,770
So 24, 25 and E ratio. So it looks like it was okay.

1003
01:47:42,770 --> 01:47:50,420
So it's okay to take a look, right? So now that I do that, what I want to do is to create the default categories.

1004
01:47:50,750 --> 01:47:58,760
So it will be below 20 between 20 and 24.9999 925 to 29.9.

1005
01:47:58,760 --> 01:48:01,640
And, and I am more equal and more left and right.

1006
01:48:02,030 --> 01:48:13,580
And then for that I use those as a BMI things and then I use to make sure that in theory you can you can kind of like get rid of some of these.

1007
01:48:13,910 --> 01:48:18,530
But I would like to put the threshold for every category very clear.

1008
01:48:18,530 --> 01:48:22,670
So then you have problems. So you can see here that will be the first one.

1009
01:48:23,910 --> 01:48:29,690
And you can I mean, you can use one, two, three, four, you can use zero, one, two, three or whatever you want.

1010
01:48:29,690 --> 01:48:33,690
Right? So it is this is is going to be a category body or you could even use like a,

1011
01:48:34,160 --> 01:48:41,540
like a variable that is a character variable and quality is like I all your notation or my normal or whatever.

1012
01:48:41,540 --> 01:48:47,839
But I don't recommend that because usually they never to have no many variables to work with in your analysis.

1013
01:48:47,840 --> 01:48:50,210
Right? So then let's call them one, two, three, four.

1014
01:48:50,600 --> 01:48:58,459
And then you can see that this will be your normal weight, this will be your overweight category and this will be your obesity category.

1015
01:48:58,460 --> 01:49:02,510
And I see that I'm specifying here very clearly in case I have missing.

1016
01:49:02,510 --> 01:49:10,850
Right. So if I run these. It's always good to go and check my love.

1017
01:49:10,880 --> 01:49:14,240
And my love is telling me nothing happened.

1018
01:49:14,630 --> 01:49:20,160
Right? Right. So then there were 500 submissions and a said Bradley broadly creative video here.

1019
01:49:20,180 --> 01:49:21,440
So you can see here. Right.

1020
01:49:23,330 --> 01:49:32,430
Usually when you're at this step, I've had this step and that will allow me to kind of like what we do because we're running out of time.

1021
01:49:32,430 --> 01:49:35,900
But then can you stay a little longer or you can.

1022
01:49:36,170 --> 01:49:41,490
Yeah. Okay. So. So you want to take what you just created, right?

1023
01:49:41,510 --> 01:49:44,629
So what? How do you check a categorical what I will do?

1024
01:49:44,630 --> 01:49:49,490
Make sure that you feel great. So, for example, you can use a block means here.

1025
01:49:54,140 --> 01:50:03,440
In the glasses they may, which is the categorical variable. You put your new variable and then you use your original variable.

1026
01:50:03,860 --> 01:50:09,560
So then you can see if the range of each category is correct.

1027
01:50:09,710 --> 01:50:16,070
So then you're doing okay. So if I want that, see the type of table that I'm going to look.

1028
01:50:17,980 --> 01:50:24,900
I mean, this is exactly the table that I want. But you shouldn't do something like hockey.

1029
01:50:25,380 --> 01:50:34,110
So the idea that in my first category goes for a minimum of 14 to 19.89, which is sadly what I want.

1030
01:50:34,230 --> 01:50:43,350
And their second go from 20 to 24.9, which is sadly, I say one thing that they're one for 25, 29.9, and then that one, 34, 44, whatever.

1031
01:50:43,860 --> 01:50:49,850
So then I can see that. Oh yeah, it's well three. Right. And I don't have any missing here.

1032
01:50:49,860 --> 01:50:53,309
So I have this complete. You have missing.

1033
01:50:53,310 --> 01:50:58,540
You will have like some help here telling you that you have this. Okay.

1034
01:50:58,550 --> 01:51:01,850
So let me go to the content.

1035
01:51:06,610 --> 01:51:10,150
So this is some of the basic pressure, this practice and sort.

1036
01:51:16,620 --> 01:51:23,840
Yeah. So for most of the time, I mean, the practice is just to check what are the contents of the.

1037
01:51:24,070 --> 01:51:33,149
And so you're going to use that a lot to see. What variables you have then roughly is for categorical variables to get frequencies and

1038
01:51:33,150 --> 01:51:40,980
tabulate or do kind of like gross demolition promises for kind of like continuous variables.

1039
01:51:41,190 --> 01:51:45,089
But univariate is also for continuous environment that gives you a little more information.

1040
01:51:45,090 --> 01:51:51,600
Like for example, you can get the normal blocks and uneven that this from normality and so on

1041
01:51:52,050 --> 01:51:56,100
properties for correlation coefficient we are not going to use these properties.

1042
01:51:56,100 --> 01:51:59,100
The plot and values is not this either.

1043
01:51:59,100 --> 01:52:06,930
And then for the multivariable for the models program from the Lambda Logistic and so on,

1044
01:52:07,290 --> 01:52:13,120
I will explain those when when we arrive to them the moment that you have to explain what we have to use.

1045
01:52:13,470 --> 01:52:20,160
So, so what I, what I would like to do is to kind of like see if I can do with you there.

1046
01:52:20,320 --> 01:52:28,830
The, the rest of this is in SAS. So, so if I do on my contents in my dataset.

1047
01:52:31,300 --> 01:52:39,190
That's give you always too much information. Right. But then all the information to be important here is giving you the number of observations,

1048
01:52:39,190 --> 01:52:43,150
something that I said, which is good and the number of items. The rest you can ignore.

1049
01:52:44,080 --> 01:52:49,569
You cannot do this because it's not important for you. And then this is the part that is most important.

1050
01:52:49,570 --> 01:52:52,120
That is the list of variables.

1051
01:52:52,120 --> 01:52:59,559
And that you can see that all of us here have labels, which is very useful because even though the variables have names that you can recognize,

1052
01:52:59,560 --> 01:53:08,709
like, okay, eight November, a BMI, BMI, BMI forgot is the categories of BMI right to decide.

1053
01:53:08,710 --> 01:53:12,910
Okay, but you don't know that height is in centimeters of eating inches.

1054
01:53:12,910 --> 01:53:17,280
Right? So that is nice that you put in centimeters in the label. So they you know, how it was measured, right?

1055
01:53:17,650 --> 01:53:28,720
This is not your ideal number. This is sex because this is this is kind of like another study that only collected non-binary binary variables.

1056
01:53:29,920 --> 01:53:31,120
This is total match.

1057
01:53:31,120 --> 01:53:38,890
What a sample is one variable that you may not have an idea what is still mix while still in your daily physical activity measured in met.

1058
01:53:39,190 --> 01:53:43,210
So now you know that that's a daily physical activity and they weight and kilograms.

1059
01:53:43,570 --> 01:53:47,080
So that's kind of like an important one, a YouTube graphic.

1060
01:53:47,860 --> 01:53:59,019
Then you have, for example, between sex and BMI for categories, then you have like across the right and then here you will have to be very careful.

1061
01:53:59,020 --> 01:54:04,839
And I will tell you that when we reached those points that SAS is going to give you the frequency,

1062
01:54:04,840 --> 01:54:08,649
the frequency, but also give you three different percentage.

1063
01:54:08,650 --> 01:54:18,100
And those those are very kind of like confusing. So be careful because the first is the cell percentage, so is 18 over 480 over the total.

1064
01:54:18,790 --> 01:54:23,350
But the second is the whole percentage. So would be 18 over 344.

1065
01:54:23,500 --> 01:54:30,100
Right. So that's 523. So then you can see that those on the raw percentages should be a hundred, right?

1066
01:54:30,880 --> 01:54:35,530
And the last one is the column percentage. So that would be 18 over 26.

1067
01:54:35,680 --> 01:54:43,570
Right. So then you can see that they can sum them that way. So be careful because this is an usual set of errors when reading the percentages.

1068
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:49,030
I'm going to stop here and I'm sorry that it took me so long, but please go.

1069
01:54:49,030 --> 01:54:54,459
Go on your own. On the on the on the test and see if you can do it.

1070
01:54:54,460 --> 01:54:59,380
You have the answer. So then and you have the goal. So make sure that you are familiar.

1071
01:54:59,380 --> 01:55:05,650
I mean, you feel reasonably comfortable with those things and but don't worry, you feel that, oh, I forgot these.

1072
01:55:05,650 --> 01:55:12,560
So I am not sure about that because I'm going to give you all the gold you are going to be working with with your colleagues and I'll be here.

1073
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:16,390
Okay? Okay. Thank you. And I'll see you next week.
