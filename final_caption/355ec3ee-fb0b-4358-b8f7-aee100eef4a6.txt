00:00:08,942 --> 00:00:12,434
In this unit, we'll introduce
the discipline of economics and

2
00:00:12,434 --> 00:00:14,511
the key problems it seeks to address.

3
00:00:14,511 --> 00:00:18,801
Fundamentally economics as
a discipline of how individuals and

4
00:00:18,801 --> 00:00:23,577
societies allocate their scarce
resources across alternative uses.

5
00:00:23,577 --> 00:00:28,069
We will then develop an intuitive
understanding of the micro economic model

6
00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:32,850
of consumer and firm behavior, incentives
are crucial to this understanding.

7
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:37,712
Micro economic theory provides a framework
for assessing when private incentives

8
00:00:37,712 --> 00:00:41,531
faced by consumers and
firms will yield desirable outcomes, and

9
00:00:41,531 --> 00:00:44,181
when those outcomes will
be less than ideal.

10
00:00:44,181 --> 00:00:49,033
We will develop an understanding of the
desirable properties of an ideal market,

11
00:00:49,033 --> 00:00:53,128
and a typology of ways that real
markets can fall short of that ideal.

12
00:00:53,128 --> 00:00:57,125
That will serve as the basis of our
analysis of the performance of the health

13
00:00:57,125 --> 00:01:00,170
care sector,
the factors that limit its performance and

14
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:03,861
the potential private regulatory
remedies for those limitations.
