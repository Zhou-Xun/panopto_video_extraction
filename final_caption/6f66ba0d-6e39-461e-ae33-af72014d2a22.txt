1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,560
I feel good about my age.

2
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:35,210
I just just is his opportunity to see where you are able to see the preferences for this perfect gift.

3
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:41,160
It's a machine of your color hamburger.

4
00:00:41,610 --> 00:01:02,040
And then I will give you a. What I thought was in terms of the the content and the work they have asked me to underwrite.

5
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:20,480
Look, I just wrote an article where I was like, I was with you.

6
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:34,390
It was like I was working on it and I was like, Yeah, I'm not even open.

7
00:01:35,710 --> 00:02:01,510
So it's like, you know, I think that would be one of the first things I was just thinking.

8
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:11,699
Wow. Name checks are coming around to outlets reporting.

9
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:20,590
Not so much what you say right before I launch into something.

10
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:28,580
Questions from last week after you had a moment to process the conversation or look at the sites.

11
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:35,700
I often think that my given site is like so clear. Everyone knows exactly what to do and it turns out that's not always the case.

12
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:42,500
So is there anything that pertains to other stuff that be.

13
00:02:49,230 --> 00:03:02,340
So the plan for today and next week, they will be about the few sessions where there is a lecture but no presentation at the second half of class.

14
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:10,790
So this is going to be one of those sessions that's a little bit more more content than some of the other classes later in the week,

15
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,050
later in the week, later in the semester.

16
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:30,360
For today and for next week, we're talking about how weight five shows examples of weight bias, overt and not so overt in various domains.

17
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,310
Today, it's going to be health care settings and within public health. Next week it will be everything else.

18
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:40,770
Once we get through that basic content of what on earth is weight bias, what does it actually look like?

19
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:47,940
Then we'll get into sort of more nuts and bolts. But that's kind of the goal for these two weeks is to be thinking about kind

20
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:54,990
of the universe of what is included under the topic of weight bias for today.

21
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:01,690
We'll definitely go close to full time, so we'll break partway through.

22
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:09,459
My hope is to leave a chunk of time at the end for you all to gather with your groups to be able to do some

23
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:15,320
preliminary brainstorming about how you might want to work together to identify a podcast and all that type of stuff.

24
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:19,280
So that's how we classify. All right.

25
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:22,650
Weight bias in health care and public health.

26
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:31,110
I'll start here with just like a quick prevalence of weight stigma before I sort of talk about how it pops up within health care and public health.

27
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:36,090
Weight bias is very common, particularly among the high weight folks.

28
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:42,630
About 40% of U.S. adults have been teased, treated unfairly or discriminated against because of their weight.

29
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:50,280
When you look at studies as to who is most likely to experience weight bias, there is a clear pattern by body size.

30
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:59,160
People of all body sizes can experience weight stigma, but it is the disproportionate burden of experiences of weight.

31
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:07,590
Stigma are experienced by people in larger bodies, and particularly the systemic forms are more limited to people in larger bodies.

32
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:14,069
But certainly like weight teasing or that kind of stuff happens actually across the weight spectrum, but again, not equally.

33
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:24,330
So if you look at studies of who experiences weight, stigma by identity is related to racial, ethnic identity and gender.

34
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:29,130
You see surprisingly few patterns.

35
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:37,210
There are some studies that say women experience more weight stigma when the comparator is men.

36
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:41,150
There are other studies where they see no gender differences.

37
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:46,320
So there's some kind of one off studies that that sort of refute this.

38
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:51,600
But in terms of there being sort of an overarching statement to say that people are experiencing weight,

39
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:57,750
stigma are sort of people is sort of in this demographic. That's not what the literature on weight bias is telling us.

40
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:05,360
What we do see is that how people react, how they internalize, how they cope with stigma.

41
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:08,660
There we see patterns by gender, by race, ethnicity,

42
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:15,260
and we're going to talk about that self actually in quite a lot of detail when we get to the session I intersectionality.

43
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:18,020
So sort of if you're interested in that, know that it's coming.

44
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:26,900
But in general you see more weight bias internalization for example from women relative to men.

45
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:31,350
There are some data in folks of other genders, but not enough.

46
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:36,499
But I can say in terms of women and men, if you're experiencing weight stigma,

47
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:41,900
the extent to which are likely to internalize it, believe it, think you deserve that mistreatment.

48
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,290
There is a gender pattern, but actually, B.A., is there isn't that gender.

49
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:55,920
So in studies where they ask about the most common source of stigma.

50
00:06:56,010 --> 00:07:02,010
Right. Who who treated you in this way because of your weight? And doctors are named as the second most common source.

51
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:07,470
That is a huge bummer that doctors are number two and these are studies of adults.

52
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:12,880
Guess who is number one? Families.

53
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:18,040
That's an even worse bummer. That is true. Family is the most named source of stigma.

54
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:25,930
That tells us a little something about how weight stigma may differ from other sources of stigma.

55
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:30,580
Right. It's in your family where you're getting sometimes these messages, but doctors are number two.

56
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:32,860
That's not to say that we can.

57
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:41,129
Sort of blame doctors as the health care professional that's doing the worst doctors of health, health care professional that people see the most.

58
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:47,310
And so that's the one that's coming up a lot. But we see weight bias in studies of a range of health care professionals.

59
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,280
Here's a picture from a paper.

60
00:07:50,280 --> 00:08:02,070
It's apparently old at this point that they talk about who is in health care settings, who did you experience or who perpetrated the weight bias?

61
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:07,590
And the doctors was most common, followed by nurses, followed by dieticians, followed by mental health professionals.

62
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:15,060
This maybe mimics the likelihood that people are going to see these health professionals, perhaps with these last two switched.

63
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:22,700
So, again, that this might be an issue of who are you seeing the most, not who is in a profession with the most amount of bias.

64
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:26,190
It is a pretty ubiquitous characteristic across health care providers.

65
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:36,460
So I'm going to walk through this picture, which I mean, I sort of a lot of the contents that I will talk through in terms of what I think is

66
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:40,740
the most important things to know related to weight bias in health care settings.

67
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:43,930
A lot of it comes from the paper based on feeling that you read,

68
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:49,300
but I want you to sort of think about kind of different components of how weight stigma pops up in health care,

69
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:58,570
the extent to which it is perpetuated by humans, by individuals within the system, and by the health care providers themselves.

70
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:09,580
The extent to which it is structural nature, how the setting and policies and procedures and sort of physical components of a environment

71
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:14,350
may perpetuate stigma and then think through what impact that has on the patient.

72
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:27,899
So the first thing we're going to talk through is how health care providers may themselves have stereotyped beliefs about people in our bodies,

73
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:35,490
like their the stereotypes they hold in the attitudes they hold. So this is a study of primary care providers.

74
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:41,120
In this study. And here I use the word obese because that is the question that was asked in this

75
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,670
particular study of how do you view your obese patients or patients with obesity?

76
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:51,020
They might have been using people first language, although this is a little bit early enough, people first language time.

77
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:58,760
More than 50% of physicians thought their high weight patients were awkward, unattractive, ugly and noncompliant.

78
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:05,340
Okay. 30% to 45% characterize them as weak willed, sloppy or lazy.

79
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:12,090
So the attitudes and stereotypes we talked about in class last week, a lot of physicians,

80
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:16,860
a lot of primary care providers are holding these beliefs that this assumption about their high weight patients.

81
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:21,049
In this study,

82
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:33,170
which is like a pretty interesting study design where providers are randomized to get a chart of a high rate patient and a low weight patient.

83
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:39,229
And everything about the patient is exactly the same with the exception of their body size.

84
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:44,240
So any sort of difference that they have in their feelings about the patient has to be because of that attribute,

85
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,350
because there's nothing else that's different. And as studies that use this design,

86
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:56,120
physicians who are seeing the charts of the higher rate patients are more likely to think that patient is less healthy,

87
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,560
that they're not taking care of themselves, that they have low self-discipline,

88
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:04,940
that they wouldn't have very much patience for patients, for that patients,

89
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:08,899
they would be more likely to think the patient's not going to follow their

90
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:12,860
advice and that they would have a lower personal desire to help the patient.

91
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:18,560
Again, only thing a difference is because of this patient is in a larger body.

92
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:23,780
They also be more likely to think, see the patient as a waste of time and that they might be annoyed by the patient.

93
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:32,820
Reactions to this other than this is a huge bummer. It makes me sad.

94
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:41,100
Yeah. I'm assuming that through medical professional, by professional and just like trash them all.

95
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:45,790
That's sort of the goal of this. This person is such and we see this at medical schools.

96
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:52,750
Also medical students, 72% report that they prefer that people to fat people.

97
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:58,989
This is a method of not interesting because that's like it's troubling but sort of

98
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:08,260
unique to the way bias is that people are much more likely to endorse explicit bias.

99
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:12,889
Right. People might say I treat patients with all genders exactly the same or all race, ethnicity.

100
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:17,010
This is exactly the same and still hold implicit biases but say they do with the same.

101
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:23,950
This is like an exception to that rule that I like my cancer patients better than my fatter patients

102
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:30,940
is something that majority of medical patients are or medical students are willing to endorse.

103
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:39,850
And it is not just a little bit more the the difference that explicit bias is either moderate or strong.

104
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:43,690
Like I have a strong preference. I strongly prefer my patients to my better patients.

105
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:55,760
And this is is a qualitative study where they asked medical students to talk about kind of their training.

106
00:12:56,060 --> 00:13:00,560
And medical students were called incidents where talking about high weight patients.

107
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:06,620
And in this study, they use a term that we said we would never use. But this is actually what medical students were being told.

108
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:14,360
They were being told that patients with morbid obesity, that's the term that they're their attendings were using,

109
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,469
that they were most often the target of derogatory, cynical humor.

110
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:25,850
So they saw people in positions of authority talking disparagingly or in a derogatory way about the highest weight patients.

111
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,139
So this becomes like an individual issue.

112
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:36,020
We get an explicit attitude that the weight the medical students hold, but also that those in positions of power, those who have authority,

113
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:44,180
those who are supposed to model good treatments, they are very much out in the open using derogatory language to talk about their fattest patients.

114
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,979
This is probably one of the older oldest studies I'll talk about in this class. But this is a study of nurses.

115
00:13:52,980 --> 00:14:03,270
It published in 1992 where you asked nurses about their interest and their abilities to take care of patients with,

116
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:10,620
quote unquote, obesity and lots of findings that suggest that nurses have anti fat attitudes.

117
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:17,460
A third of them said, given the choice, most most nurses would prefer not to care for obese patients.

118
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:26,749
Also the second one, adults are obese. Patients should be put on a diet within the hospital to think that if someone is

119
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:31,459
coming is medically admitted for a medical crisis or something along those lines,

120
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:39,400
that this is the time to under be them. That feels just like a wild nutritional choice, if nothing else.

121
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:46,910
It's so interesting to think that if someone is going through something serious that that should

122
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:52,700
that sort of a diet or restrictive eating or sort of talking about weight would even feel relevant.

123
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:57,319
If that always sort of surprises me as a dietitian, like if someone needs to heal or is in crisis,

124
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:01,700
we don't feed them in such a highly catabolic state.

125
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:06,400
I would say like it's a wound healing issues like this is why we are feeding.

126
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:11,620
This is our feeding protein, this is what we're doing things to keep people in recovery,

127
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:18,379
not restricting this idea that like let's to feed them less so they can quickly lose weight before discharge.

128
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:24,650
Like this is like sort of nonsensical in ethical thoughts, but this is something that, again, it's a long time ago,

129
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:28,790
but this was something that nurses thought that weight was a such a sort of a grave issue

130
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:32,149
that it had to be addressed irrespective of what else was happening to the outcome.

131
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:36,700
I can ask, given that it was 1990, has this changed a little bit?

132
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:41,930
Hopefully, maybe so.

133
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:46,879
In newer studies where anti fat attitudes are assessed in health professionals,

134
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:56,360
it's not like we're seeing attitudes improving and we don't see, as I said, attitudes improving on a population level either.

135
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,040
I'm trying to think what lecture I would present.

136
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:06,649
This data might actually be next week, but an implicit attitude test where you're assessing not your outward preferences,

137
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:13,190
but sort of how you react to that in our versus better bodies, that type of test we do to assess people with different body sizes,

138
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:17,629
but also people with different genders, different religions, different race ethnicities.

139
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:20,330
And this is a kind of test that we've been doing for years.

140
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:33,800
And so we can look at patterns in implicit bias over time and biased by body size and disability are the only two that seem to be going up.

141
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:42,290
Everything else is decreasing. We have like a major problem with bias and mistreatment of people in communities in this country.

142
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:48,170
But implicit biases over time are, at least on average, not in the space of weight.

143
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:53,640
Appropriation that was like specific to the obese. Adults should be put on a diet in high school.

144
00:16:53,750 --> 00:17:00,900
Yeah, like that's the question to gauge. Or would that be an actual decision made when someone fry?

145
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:04,309
It is. That's actually a really good question.

146
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:10,190
So the idea here was a question to gauge people's bias,

147
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:20,629
but are there doctors who look for dieticians who might under feed a patient on parenteral or enteral nutrition, who is in a larger body?

148
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:28,070
Probably that's a thing that happens, but this isn't necessarily a decision point that is actually done in hospitals.

149
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:32,300
But again, individual practice kinds folks are very in a really problematic way.

150
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:41,470
Dieticians and coming for you. So this is a study of dietetic students.

151
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:49,989
They use a similar study design as where they use the medical record,

152
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:55,780
where everything about the patient was exactly the same except for their body size or body fat percentage.

153
00:17:55,780 --> 00:18:03,790
And this one they had men and women. They sort of had gender distinctions also in the demographic information, the patient,

154
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:09,399
it was hypothetical and they said that the patient was recently diagnosed with lactose

155
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:14,860
intolerance and they intentionally picked a diagnosis that has no relationship with weight.

156
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:22,330
Full stop. Right. There is nothing about a intervention for lactose intolerance that you can make an argument for.

157
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:28,270
You would offer different advice for someone based on their body size. And so that was the study design here.

158
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:37,179
Folks were randomized to see the different profiles and really a consistent pattern emerged that for the higher weight patients,

159
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:43,300
the dietician assumed that their diet quality was lower, even though their dietary recall was identical.

160
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:50,440
They assumed that their health status was lower, even though all of their biochemical parameters were exactly the same,

161
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:55,900
and they thought they were going to be less likely to comply with treatment recommendations if they were in the larger body,

162
00:18:55,900 --> 00:19:02,050
even though you had no information that suggested that they would be more or less compliant.

163
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:13,389
And those patterns you saw for both men and women. So that was attitudes, right?

164
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:22,270
Attitude, the stereotypes. We are seen fairly commonly in health care providers that are supportive of anti fatness.

165
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:27,700
This, not surprisingly, affects communication and decision making.

166
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:33,639
You're holding these really nasty beliefs about people because of the way they looked likely.

167
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,800
That is changing how you interact with those patients.

168
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:45,250
So across several studies, this is what we see that providers spend less time and weight in appointments with heavier patients.

169
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:52,000
They spend less time in rapport building. They have less discussion and provide less intervention.

170
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:58,640
So all of this. While believing these patients are less healthy.

171
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,240
So in the same study, as you say, how healthy is this patient? Very unhealthy.

172
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:06,499
How much time would you spend with just nature? Not very much. Right.

173
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,030
Both these things are happening at the same time.

174
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:16,879
You would imagine if your patient is more at risk or you perceive them to be in greater need, that you would spend more, not less time with them.

175
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:22,490
But that sort of what we're seeing across studies of interactions with higher weight patients.

176
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:34,470
So moving on to the health care settings, so thinking about the systems in which people receive health care.

177
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:41,070
And here we think about the office environment and practices and policies within health care systems.

178
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,840
The physical environment is often pretty hostile to people in larger bodies.

179
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:49,330
They don't physically accommodate their needs.

180
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:58,800
We see this in seating where we have chairs with armrests in lieu of benches or sort of similar type seating.

181
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:06,389
You see reading materials that really are promoting an ideal. I feel like a doctor's office should never have a mental fitness or Shape magazine

182
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:09,810
in the waiting room that feels sort of at odds with the promotion of health.

183
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:18,890
And yet those things often happen. You see insufficient use of ramps or handrails or just general issues of inaccessibility

184
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:24,230
in the office environment that is hostile to bodies is often hostile to disabled bodies.

185
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:30,230
A huge issue within the office environment is what is the default medical equipment?

186
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:32,000
What are you stocking your rooms with?

187
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:40,120
Are there hospital gowns for people in small bodies, or is there a range of hospital gowns within a particular room?

188
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:44,500
Is there one blood pressure cup or there are three blood pressure cuffs because you can not

189
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:48,910
get an accurate blood pressure cuff reading on someone in a fat body with a standard cuff.

190
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:55,450
This is a huge issue with speculum for pelvic exams.

191
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:01,600
Standard issue. And I say standard issue. It's sort of biased issue.

192
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:11,320
Speculation cannot or can usually not being used to visualize a cervix of people in larger bodies.

193
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,180
And so if there's only one suspect in a room,

194
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:21,460
you're creating the opportunity for someone to have a really embarrassing, painful or unsuccessful screening exam.

195
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,840
Right. To debate the providers say you have to come back. This wasn't time.

196
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:27,130
I couldn't see your cervix. I couldn't actually do this.

197
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:33,309
And then you also think about sort of just physical spaces, the extent to which doorways, hallways,

198
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:41,320
restrooms are accessible to people across the weight spectrum and again, with various levels of mobility concerns.

199
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:54,340
There's also practices and policies unblinded waived as standard practice in most health care settings.

200
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:59,290
The last time you went to see a doctor, did you get wait, did you see it?

201
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:08,679
Did they ask you permission? Seems like a lot of opportunities for maybe that way, maybe asking permission, maybe just not showing people.

202
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:13,900
But that's just not that's just not what we're doing. We're assuming that that is the right way to just start a visit.

203
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:21,160
Discussion of body size is fairly standard practice in medical visits,

204
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:31,450
particularly primary care sessions that the American Academy of Pediatrics super a double down on that yesterday when they released

205
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:39,009
some new guidelines related to the management of high weight in younger people that you had to talk about it every single time,

206
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:42,880
all the time. And many doctors think it is their obligation.

207
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:46,570
Right. How could I possibly see a patient that is fat and not tell them that?

208
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:49,780
Right. They will probably be earth shattering information to them,

209
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:52,630
but they sort of feel like that is their obligation they have to bring up every single time.

210
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:59,410
Most of our policies and procedures related to treating patients with high

211
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:04,150
weight require documenting our documentation using terms that are stigmatizing.

212
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:11,829
And then within many health care settings, there are weight requirements or weight cutoffs that are used to decide who gets treatment,

213
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:17,709
who gets a stay in treatment with, say, treatment. I think about eating disorders in terms of who gets treatment.

214
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:27,010
There's a lot of rules related to elective procedures which may look like a knee replacement and may look like gender affirming surgeries.

215
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:30,009
It may look like access to fertility treatment.

216
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:39,520
So there's a lot of types of procedures where if you don't meet a specific standard, you can actually access care in order to get to the center.

217
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:49,270
But just in general, when you're looking at kind of using weight as a way to kind of help qualify, help, go ahead.

218
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:58,120
What other like we talk the talk about metabolic health and like what does what do those kinds of testings look like?

219
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:03,500
Whereas if you work and use BMI, what would you use? Is that as I understand it?

220
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:04,990
Yeah, that's yes.

221
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:19,150
So any number of things and the argument will always be about BMI is sort of quick and efficient and cheap and those things are all true.

222
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:25,569
And yet it reinforces stigma and it leads to improper care of people in high weights.

223
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:29,020
And so those arguments fall flat. I think that's the the alternative.

224
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,270
I think it is it is pulse, it is blood pressure, it is fasting glucose.

225
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:38,350
It is a lipid panel.

226
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:44,800
It is measures of mental health, including health related quality of life, depression, anxiety.

227
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:54,879
There are some groups that have proposed what to do instead of BMI or what to do in addition to BMI.

228
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:59,170
So one of the examples there is that admittance AP criteria is that I think folks have encountered.

229
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:03,400
So that's a criteria that tries to separate out.

230
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:11,629
What it means to have a high BMI and no metabolic risk factors, a high BMI plus metabolic risk factors.

231
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:21,800
And so it's a step in the right direction of putting healthy in the conversation of other health parameters, more objective health parameters.

232
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:27,140
I think there's arguments for and against why we use BMI at all, which we'll get to more in this class.

233
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:35,309
But it is it is true that anything that we use as sort of a quick assessment of health is going to require more time,

234
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:36,740
be more expensive or more invasive.

235
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:48,930
I mean, I guess my my question for the weight requirements, I guess, a, not every procedure probably needs a weight requirement at that point,

236
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:55,740
but aren't there like I think with generals with like issues with general anesthesia or let's

237
00:26:55,740 --> 00:27:02,040
say if it's open heart surgery where it's a bit more difficult to work on larger bodies?

238
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:07,420
Yeah, I guess in hindsight it makes sense that a little bit of weight loss probably will make a big difference in that regard.

239
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:14,509
But like. Wouldn't that explain some of the weight requirements or why certain doctors might not want to operate

240
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:20,810
on larger patients because they're not confident that they could provide adequate quality care?

241
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:24,770
Yeah, it's such a good question. I feel like I want to pack it up like a dozen levels.

242
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:29,420
I think the last thing you said is that the clinicians may not feel confident.

243
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:35,630
And the truth is, is that clinicians are not trained to do procedures on fat bodies.

244
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:41,780
If you ask a resident if you how many pelvic exams did you do, how many were on fat patients?

245
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:50,540
It is not matching the proportion of the world that is fat. Right. And so we are trained to treat thin bodies.

246
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:56,659
Fat bodies cannot be donated as cadavers like we are just simply not trained on those bodies.

247
00:27:56,660 --> 00:28:03,379
And so it is absolutely true that a clinician may not feel confident and we have to honor that right.

248
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:09,140
The issue becomes systemic. We need to train people to to treat people across the weight spectrum.

249
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:14,390
But that is, I think, absolutely true. And then the question related to anesthesia risk,

250
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:25,460
the risk with the anesthesia in a fat body is higher for complications, not as high or as different as we think it is.

251
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:32,749
And there's always a risk of the anesthesia, which we include informed consent.

252
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:40,850
And so the question is, should a patient in a federal body be given the right to have a procedure with informed consent like a thinner person,

253
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:45,410
or should we make that decision for them? So I think that's part of that conversation.

254
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:52,069
Another third thing, I might stop at three and I'll probably come back to some of this other stuff relates to what

255
00:28:52,070 --> 00:29:01,879
about the surgical outcomes and what about how folks are doing when you withhold treatments?

256
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:11,990
And I'm thinking specifically about like knee replacement surgeries that there are some places that require a weight loss before a procedure.

257
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:17,420
And if you look at people who lose weight and have the procedure versus those that don't and are given the procedure,

258
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:22,340
the outcomes are no different or better and people will get the treatment sooner rather than later.

259
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:25,880
And so I think this is an area where these are empirical questions.

260
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:31,129
Instead of saying, I only want to treat in patients who are are thinner, I feel more comfortable.

261
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:36,709
Their surgical risk is maybe somewhat lower. If we're truly trying to improve people's quality of life,

262
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:45,110
let's collect that data and understand are these are these restrictions are these requirements for weight loss actually warranted?

263
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:53,399
And I think that's what's exciting about being in public health or being in a medical field is like, let's make this empirical question,

264
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:58,900
and if we are doing this to really serve the patient, we're looking out for a patient like let's let the data tell us that.

265
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:08,550
And the studies that have been doing this in the space of of kind of being hip replacements, like it's just not borne out in the data.

266
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:13,230
Teach you about that? Yeah. Just going off of I think the first point.

267
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:22,379
Has there been any push and I guess at what level for medical equipment and standardized patients in training that are better?

268
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:28,110
Because like I mean obviously I'm pretty sure every CPR dummy I've ever seen is modeled after a thin body.

269
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,890
And I would wager the majority of standardized patients,

270
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:40,360
my sister and boyfriend who are in medical school have seen are probably not fat or are on the small fat side of things.

271
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,850
So is there been any pushing?

272
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:50,760
Does that if there is any that does it happen at like the more higher level at the AMA level or at medical school by medical school basis?

273
00:30:50,970 --> 00:31:02,520
Yeah, to be totally honest, I actually haven't seen. Much in the way of that from a medical institution perspective.

274
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:11,099
There have been some studies done by weight bias researchers that say how does this affect our trainees

275
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:16,110
when they work with actual fat people like the study designs feel like absurd but also brilliant.

276
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:23,400
It turns out when you talk to actual fat people, you have more empathy and more connection, particularly if you are not yourself fat.

277
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:27,990
And so there've been some studies that that actually improves implicit attitudes,

278
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:33,120
at least in the short term, if you have more interactions with people who look different from you.

279
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,830
And so there's emerging data to suggest that we should be doing this.

280
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:52,680
But I haven't seen any concerted effort of sort of pushing to make body size diversity incorporated

281
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:57,480
into decisions about who people are trained on or how medical training in general practice.

282
00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:02,610
It seems like a sort of an exciting opportunity for advocacy, right?

283
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:06,180
Like we can think whatever we want about health and body size,

284
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:12,000
but the reality is medical providers should want to provide the best possible care for the patients that they see.

285
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:19,260
And if you've never been trained to do a procedure on a body that 30% or 60% of your patients have, you cannot provide good care.

286
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:23,880
And that that becomes it feels harder to argue against something like that.

287
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:26,120
You have a question? Yeah.

288
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:36,420
I was wondering last class I in the reading brought up the I guess I hadn't heard this before that we need to stop treating obesity as a disease.

289
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:42,899
And I'm wondering how much of this is part of the issue where I think in the health

290
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:50,060
professions you get training to see this as a chronic disease and we treat it this way,

291
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:53,670
you know? So it's a good question.

292
00:32:53,670 --> 00:33:01,650
We will come back to this a lot in this session on weight science, the extent to which the decision to make obesity disease,

293
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:09,090
what sort of the the data to support it and sort of kind of limitations of that data.

294
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:18,870
And I think obesity, for better or worse, and we can come down on various ways that that decision is going to be licit a disease for a while.

295
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:23,129
And we have to think about do the interventions that we deliver,

296
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:28,800
given the fact that that is listed as disease, is it actually helping or hurting our fat patients?

297
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:36,900
And I think that's that the issue is by calling it a disease, if we're over focusing in on it and we're by doing that,

298
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:42,870
harming our patients, then that diagnosis is actually not serving our patients.

299
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:49,200
Right. I think there's a there's a there's a place where we can have a disease code

300
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:52,410
where it doesn't mean it has to be the only thing you talk about in visits.

301
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:57,660
I think one of the sort of bigger arguments against having obesity listed as a

302
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:03,299
disease is that we have the way that we have created criteria for that diagnosis.

303
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:08,790
We are using it. We are using only BMI to make that diagnosis.

304
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:17,700
And it is such a problematic metric because it gets it wrong so, so much in terms of just adiposity and certainly for health,

305
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:25,049
that that's maybe where the conversation we can have some kind of more of a nuanced conversation of what does it look like

306
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:32,940
to have a disease that actually reflects people's body composition and health more accurately than a BMI based cutoffs and.

307
00:34:35,390 --> 00:34:38,780
We figured out how to wear a mask and glasses. It was taken four years.

308
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:41,880
I still cannot say when it was like What? I'd like to see you all.

309
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:44,900
Or would I like to see you all in? Either is an option.

310
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:59,020
So the attitudes and the stereotypes, the decision making, the sort of systemic stuff within medical systems, not surprisingly, is affecting patients.

311
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:05,380
Really ask patients, what is it like to go to the doctor when you are that person?

312
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:13,629
You hear that they are. Heard a lot of blaming and dismissive statements regarding the challenges of

313
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:17,700
way too often from a thin provider or given simplistic weight loss advice,

314
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:21,910
also often from a thin provider who is resource crazy.

315
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:29,140
These experiences create unrealistic expectations about the controllability of weight and about the effects of small lifestyle change.

316
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:36,100
Folks feel minimized, and I will tell you that the vast majority of people in larger bodies have done a whole lot to try to control their weight.

317
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:41,200
They've been told they need to control their weight from the second they were gaining weight or in a larger body.

318
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:47,080
And so for somebody who's never had like no lived experience and fat body, it says this is I would do if I were you.

319
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:51,070
Look at how simple would be. It is. It's just so invalidating.

320
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:56,070
Patients report that every problem is attributed to weight.

321
00:35:57,210 --> 00:36:02,520
Sometimes you'll hear the phrase fat broken arms syndrome, where fat patients say they go to the doctor because their arm is broken.

322
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:06,810
And the doctor says, Did you know that your waist high has nothing to do with the issue at hand?

323
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:10,020
You see this with things like strep throat.

324
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:18,479
That sort of this sort of opportunity to to talk about weight is something that doctors are doing all the time.

325
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:25,830
And it makes people feel like they are seen only in terms of their size and that the doctors are spending time giving them unsolicited advice

326
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:32,400
about treating their bodies instead of spending time offering them good evidence based care for the reason that they're actually there.

327
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:40,770
It's an issue that I already alluded to related to the physical equipment.

328
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:44,320
Medical equipment is ill. Fitting procedures are designed for thin bodies.

329
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:48,850
This will signal to the patient that they are unusual and that they do not belong.

330
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:58,060
Even worse, perhaps, is that they are getting inaccurate, ineffective and painful and embarrassing procedures to be given.

331
00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:02,140
Imagine being a fat adolescent giving your first pelvic exam.

332
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:08,560
It is long, it is painful. And the doctor is like, sorry we didn't get anything like that is a really traumatic experience.

333
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:17,260
Right. And having better training for clinicians, booking longer appointment times because of pelvic exam, I keep my best example,

334
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:23,390
but I feel like there's just so much data related to issues with screening and people nurture bodies in that headspace.

335
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:29,319
Spending having more time to get doing the training and having the equipment stocked.

336
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:35,559
You can create such a more welcoming environment for something that is going to be difficult for a lot of folks,

337
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:40,150
and it's just could be made so much better with some of these structural changes.

338
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:48,960
They also provided the example last week, but it's sort of another issue in the equipment space relates to needle lengths for vaccines.

339
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:52,709
Right. We use a standard, one inch standard. Again, I keep using the word standard.

340
00:37:52,710 --> 00:38:00,350
And when you hear the word standard, that should be code for systemic bias, like we've decided whose stuff is made for it.

341
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:03,360
So standard needles are made for thin bodies, right?

342
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,550
A wattage needle, COVID vaccine rollout.

343
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:11,940
We knew that one and a half inch needles are more appropriate for people in better bodies because of just subcutaneous thickness.

344
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,600
But most people didn't know that they had to ask for longer needles.

345
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:20,270
And if you went to like a mass vaccination site, you are getting a one inch needle.

346
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,169
So we are giving substandard care.

347
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:30,390
We know very well this needle like standard needle length is not standard and should be based on people's body sizes.

348
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:45,220
On. That's even. How prevalent is the issue of poorly scaled medical doses to on February six?

349
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:53,030
I know like it was a really big talking point about how plan B is like only goes up to £175, which is yeah.

350
00:38:53,220 --> 00:39:01,370
Obscene. Obscene, yeah. But how prevalent is that across other like either even prescribed or over-the-counter medications?

351
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:13,470
It's a really good question. So plan B and other forms of emergency contraception, what is the weight, the body size of the people that it works for?

352
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:17,610
Some studies suggest a cutoff of one £75.

353
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:28,890
Some suggest even a slightly lower cut off of somewhere in the 150 to 160 range where where dosage requirements differ.

354
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:36,120
And I think we know a lot about plan B one, because the cut off affects so many people,

355
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:39,180
like the majority of people in this country, way more than £150.

356
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:43,530
And you are seeing lots of unintended pregnancy people in our bodies.

357
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:50,309
And so I think the awareness of that particular medicine is so much higher, the extent to which that applies across different medicines,

358
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:59,190
I think the answer is sort of unknown because clinical studies don't necessarily need to enroll people of all body sizes.

359
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:07,080
Right? When you do a study with the NIH, you have to say who you are enrolling in terms of their gender identity, in their race, ethnicity.

360
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:13,950
And if you are including people of only one gender, you have to say why there is if anyone has been involved, the NIH grant, there is a full page.

361
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:17,880
Why are you only including people in this age group, in this demographic?

362
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:25,649
It has to be scientifically justified. There is not an analogous section for why are you only including fat people in your studies, right?

363
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:27,720
So medicines that have been around for a really long time,

364
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:34,230
they may be were tested in a convenient sample and by convenient sample, it's usually weight loss seeking folks or thin people.

365
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:40,530
People no co-morbidities, which you're going to see fewer co-morbidities and people in smaller bodies.

366
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:51,810
And so the extent to which this issue of effective medications, how that might differ by body size is probably bigger than we understand,

367
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:59,010
I think more recently, particularly in the in the age of COVID, because there was that concern super early in COVID,

368
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:07,230
that there was sort of a difference in outcomes based on body size, on all of the companies that put out vaccines,

369
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:16,500
intentionally recruited by body weight category so that they could look not just at the effectiveness of the vaccine,

370
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:21,480
but look at it broken down by body size and they saw no difference across body sizes.

371
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:29,399
So what is looked at sometimes is good news, right? The pharmacokinetics of medication does depend on body size for some medications,

372
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:32,880
but it doesn't necessarily translate to this only works for thin bodies.

373
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:38,040
In the case of the COVID vaccine, we didn't see that. In the case of Plan B, we certainly see that.

374
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:43,530
I have never seen anyone make an attempt to say like, these are the medicines that if you are in are fat or body,

375
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:47,609
like for the love of God, ask for a higher dose, right?

376
00:41:47,610 --> 00:41:53,640
I've never seen us to be able to really critically look at whether a medicine has been tested in someone in large body.

377
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:03,129
But talking about medical devices, I would assume like MRI machines and like other scans like that, like that.

378
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:05,320
Those are those like compliant as well.

379
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:11,950
And like, are people less likely to receive that, those scans if they need them because they're so they have a weight limit.

380
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:18,850
We're going to watch a video at some point today. I am like for awareness of time and space right now, probably a little bit.

381
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:24,729
We're gonna watch a video that talks about how medical equipment has a weight limit.

382
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:32,860
And so you may be at a facility that has an MRI machine that does or does not fit you or that doesn't fit you.

383
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:37,240
Right. And so I think there has been some improvement in.

384
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:48,910
Capacity of medical beds, of default wheelchairs at hospitals that are trying to accommodate sort of larger body sizes.

385
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:52,149
But that is, I think, inconsistently true of certain machines.

386
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:57,670
And so it is very possible that you may be at a place that cannot weigh you, that cannot scan you,

387
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:03,640
and that you have to be sent to a sort of a more specialized facility that might have equipment with a larger capacity.

388
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:09,280
The excuses money always excuses money.

389
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:14,559
And like these equipment, this equipment is expensive and it takes up more physical space.

390
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:19,660
Right. Hospitals were designed, older hospitals were designed when equipment was different.

391
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:25,270
People's bodies on average were somewhat different. And so to say, like, how will we change our workflow?

392
00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:32,050
How will we sort of change our rooms if our if our beds are bigger, our wheelchairs are bigger, or if our MRI machine is bigger?

393
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:38,350
It is a it is a conversation. It is a conversation related to space allocation and money.

394
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:47,379
But it is also an equity issue. Right, to say that people in fatter bodies require more space and more resources.

395
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:50,110
That is true, right? I'm thinking about resources.

396
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:55,990
If you have somebody who's in surgery and their body needs to be physically moved, you might need extra people to do that.

397
00:43:56,290 --> 00:44:00,070
So it's not that they don't require more space and more resources at that. It's an equity issue.

398
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:05,960
People who are not native English speakers. Erekat, Interpreter They also require more resources, right?

399
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:11,950
People with disabilities require more resources because there are accommodations that are necessary.

400
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:18,010
But that doesn't mean we say, fine, we'll give you substandard care. We provide resources and other spaces in a way that we don't with fatness.

401
00:44:19,610 --> 00:44:27,980
I was a quick follow up question was in terms of the cost of getting equipment that I can accommodate all individuals, I don't know.

402
00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:31,320
That argument doesn't really hold up to me because if you just bought one, that could.

403
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:39,890
Like, just. But do more for all patients instead of having to send someone to like a separate facility.

404
00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:44,870
And you can use one piece of equipment on larger body individuals and then

405
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:48,980
smaller size individuals like that just have to think about what is standard,

406
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:55,690
right? So if a thin needle is standard, works for thin people but doesn't work for fat people, that's a problem.

407
00:44:55,700 --> 00:45:01,249
If we had made the standard needle 1.5 inch needle, is that actually harming thin people?

408
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:04,250
I don't know. I'm you know, I masquerade as a doctor, but I actually am not one.

409
00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:12,799
And so if the question if the answer was 1.5, if goals are good for everyone, then that should be the standard.

410
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:18,710
And is that also true for things like MRI equipment? The big one is good for everyone and this one is only good for some people.

411
00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:25,370
Default to the standard that helps more people. And it's that I guess I know the question too.

412
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:29,570
It's not an easy question. I know the answer to you guys.

413
00:45:29,570 --> 00:45:32,590
It's been a long just a question. I know the answer to it.

414
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:37,759
Like, is there sort of a similar equity argument that's made that this would somehow harm thin people?

415
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,229
It's hard to imagine that that would be true.

416
00:45:39,230 --> 00:45:45,290
But I think, again, it's an empirical question of how can we provide services and equipment that helps those people.

417
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:49,190
Yeah. When like thinking about like what is the standard?

418
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:54,950
I know like other fields you're required to like reach gender or just kind of like look into how to change that.

419
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:57,979
Has similar things been done?

420
00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:05,780
And I'm assuming, yes, in the medical sphere and if so, like what is like, I guess time limit or requirement for like standardization?

421
00:46:05,870 --> 00:46:12,049
I don't know the answer that question, it seems like I would hope that the answer to that is yes, but I don't actually know the answer that question.

422
00:46:12,050 --> 00:46:18,140
By the time we get to intervention and policies, I will know that better.

423
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:22,730
But to what extent do we re evaluate? What does it mean to have a stock room?

424
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,830
What does it mean to have sort of enough space around a medical bed?

425
00:46:28,130 --> 00:46:31,730
What does it mean to have a waiting room that is accommodating?

426
00:46:32,810 --> 00:46:36,850
And who makes those decisions? Is it at the hospital level or is it something higher?

427
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:45,010
So stay tuned. So how does all of this impact care?

428
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:57,010
I mentioned the pelvic exam example because there is a ton of data that says we see lower rates of breast and cervical cancer screening in people,

429
00:46:57,010 --> 00:47:00,900
larger bodies. There is actually a review article.

430
00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:04,600
There is enough studies that we could do a review article to say that consistently

431
00:47:04,870 --> 00:47:10,660
fatter patients are getting fewer pap tests and cervical exams and less mammography.

432
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:18,489
There's also a study where they asked physicians about whether or not they would be comfortable performing pelvic exam,

433
00:47:18,490 --> 00:47:23,230
some people with higher body weights. And 70% of physicians said they would be uncomfortable.

434
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:27,459
What I find remarkable about this particular paper is in the abstract,

435
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:36,070
they say a remarkable minority of doctors said they would be uncomfortable performing pelvic exam on higher weight patients with one out of five said,

436
00:47:36,070 --> 00:47:39,700
I don't want to do a pelvic exam on that patient. That felt shocking.

437
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:41,110
And they thought, oh, it's pretty low.

438
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:49,329
And we've talked about like, again, if you're not trained on this and you feel like you might do a bad job, you can understand the reluctance.

439
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:54,800
But this is, again, a systemic issue with an intervention work training.

440
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:58,840
Right. This is something that people should not not be getting screened for. The doctors that feel comfortable with it.

441
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:01,450
Right. Cancer screening is lifesaving.

442
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:11,530
Yet these are the lower rates of screening because women are less likely to go into they're less likely to make an appointment.

443
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:16,300
Or is it because the doctors are more reluctant to perform the procedure?

444
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:19,900
It's a great question. That's totally my next my next slide. So both are true.

445
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:23,709
So why not? Some of it is on the part of the clinician. I don't want to do this procedure.

446
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:27,530
I'm uncomfortable. This might take too long. Not offering it.

447
00:48:27,550 --> 00:48:33,880
The other half of this is that people in their four bodies are much more likely to cancel or delay appointments,

448
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:39,490
cancel delay appointments where routine screening might happen. And so it's sort of it's both.

449
00:48:39,490 --> 00:48:45,820
And both sides of this explanation underneath it is, is weight bias.

450
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:51,609
Because when people say that they are unlikely to keep appointments more likely to

451
00:48:51,610 --> 00:48:55,300
delay or cancel just because they don't want to be lectured about their weight,

452
00:48:55,630 --> 00:48:59,380
it is so traumatizing and retraumatizing to get this every single time.

453
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:03,640
Folks don't want to be weighed. They don't want to know that they gateway. They don't want to be given simplistic advice.

454
00:49:03,910 --> 00:49:07,600
It is so distressing to get this time and time again that you just simply don't go.

455
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:13,900
One reaction to experience is stigma, which we'll talk about more in a couple of weeks is avoiding stigmatizing domains.

456
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:17,860
If you know, every time that you go to a particular place, someone is going to be mean to you.

457
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:22,870
You stop going to that place. Very normal response to experiencing bad treatment.

458
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:28,629
And so that again, this is on the part of the patient, but it circles back to what their experience is.

459
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:33,400
It's sort of their chronic exposure to weight stigma within within health care settings.

460
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:41,440
All right. So there is a video of our folks up for a 12 minute video and then will take a long break.

461
00:49:43,570 --> 00:49:49,770
So I want to share a video that talks about experience with medical weight stigma.

462
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:57,640
Just because I think personal narratives are are probably more important than showing data on this particular patient.

463
00:49:57,650 --> 00:50:00,969
You will notice a person she's talking as a patient.

464
00:50:00,970 --> 00:50:08,140
But this started a lot of her own lived experience uses terms that we talked about last week as being sort of non-preferred or stigmatizing.

465
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:12,280
So she is someone who self-identifies as having obesity.

466
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:14,649
I would like to be treated for that obesity.

467
00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:23,440
And so I think it's again, also it's an interesting example of people's experience with medical weight stigma,

468
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:30,429
but also exposure to variability of how people perceive their body size and the extent to which they do or do not relate to it as a disease.

469
00:50:30,430 --> 00:50:33,880
So you can sort of flag both of those things as you're watching,

470
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:40,610
but let's hope all these things work out like a weight loss add she didn't this on our

471
00:50:40,630 --> 00:50:45,790
menu of course how relatable analyzing all of my things right now has been great.

472
00:50:45,790 --> 00:50:52,970
So I think that just about opens every single one. It's not like it's from 116.

473
00:50:53,230 --> 00:50:59,770
I think it was 40 minutes.

474
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:08,390
And when I look at the sexual.

475
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:15,560
Maybe we are suppressed, unmotivated, motivated.

476
00:51:16,790 --> 00:51:20,100
How bad is this down for you? Pretty low.

477
00:51:20,450 --> 00:51:24,740
Pretty low. I know. I was hoping for a different answer than that, but I actually know what the answer is.

478
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:32,280
That's not true. Let's take a break. Now I'll fix the volume and then we will cover it.

479
00:51:32,450 --> 00:51:36,360
So let's reconvene at 205.

480
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:50,160
I don't have to think about what you agreed with me about to blow your mind.

481
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:55,500
That's when I just thought.

482
00:51:56,160 --> 00:52:04,500
Oh, so we're going to ask you.

483
00:52:05,270 --> 00:52:09,980
Yes. I really like this woman. Are you kidding me?

484
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:17,430
What am I supposed to submit to you guys for dinner?

485
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:21,450
And I think you should be on the air for my pinnacle recording.

486
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:24,940
Also for, I think tried for.

487
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:42,720
And then they open up one year where I work. And so I came because I think I might have something, but I don't think there would be any more interest.

488
00:52:43,070 --> 00:52:49,899
I think I think once I really look down and see what's working and missing.

489
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:53,910
Chris, these meetings crazy. Okay.

490
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:59,220
Are you in the picture in Hamburg? Ten years ago, you got the first word you have.

491
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:10,809
I want to get a witness on the program because now also, I do believe that just because when I was in high school, I was a little strange.

492
00:53:10,810 --> 00:53:14,890
I feel like I don't have a choice. I think I choose.

493
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:25,430
I know I'm in. They're like, what? I learned how it's gonna be like, Thank you for your early world.

494
00:53:25,590 --> 00:53:35,190
I don't know what it's like to branch out.

495
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:42,970
I feel like it's like I'm a husband, something like that.

496
00:53:44,050 --> 00:53:50,400
But I like it that I have no problem. She's like, Oh yeah, we're not talking about Vietnam.

497
00:53:50,770 --> 00:53:56,080
I was like, Oh, there's nothing in it.

498
00:53:56,140 --> 00:54:01,670
It was my cleats are like cheap from Nike research.

499
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:12,010
And afterwards my family broke out and they seem like there's so much time.

500
00:54:12,010 --> 00:54:23,640
And then I went to like, I'm going to find out about this because like all the EU countries, including countries, of course the USA that you do.

501
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:36,090
So I have to like either buy my shoes from abroad, but for use their shoes I just like so much so it's ah yeah, oh yeah.

502
00:54:36,350 --> 00:54:40,839
You've got to sit next to people to fix it on my end.

503
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:44,680
So I'm going to try to do that right now. Yeah, I know. It's, it's like a super at home.

504
00:54:44,710 --> 00:54:48,390
I haven't been there like, yeah, this is like living my life that much.

505
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:51,790
I wonder if I want to start at this point.

506
00:54:51,790 --> 00:55:00,790
I mean, it's like well over a decade, but I mean, similar to what you said,

507
00:55:00,790 --> 00:55:11,300
I just [INAUDIBLE] 20 years ago, I used to have a lot of excuse for discussion.

508
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:18,730
And your graduate assignment, you know, it's actually these are still oh, my.

509
00:55:19,570 --> 00:55:23,830
Oh, you know, like hers will be.

510
00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:53,110
Well, I was talking to my husband and I'm like, oh, yeah, no, I was just thinking about something in the day to know.

511
00:55:53,110 --> 00:56:00,460
For me that was a like, oh yeah, for sure.

512
00:56:01,270 --> 00:56:13,510
I saw that because I also think I think about your father online or something.

513
00:56:15,370 --> 00:56:20,800
Sure. Is that also I mean it.

514
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:29,470
She said that I was moved to tears because she said emotional experience.

515
00:56:29,490 --> 00:56:38,360
Yeah. Cause you never had a really good introduction.

516
00:56:38,410 --> 00:56:45,010
I just like, are you going to be arrested? I just think, like, someone should do something.

517
00:56:45,010 --> 00:56:56,620
So it was good. Yeah. You did a lot of fun and it's a funny name and I thought, Oh, okay.

518
00:56:56,680 --> 00:57:05,500
I would just be like, Yeah, you know, there's a lot of desire.

519
00:57:05,950 --> 00:57:21,600
Yeah, well, I thought because I was like, I always looking at that and I was like, I'm sorry, what was you like?

520
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:32,300
She was so happy about it.

521
00:57:36,630 --> 00:57:39,660
So, you know, even today I was like that.

522
00:57:39,690 --> 00:57:44,900
I know. I know.

523
00:57:46,470 --> 00:57:50,480
I know. There are so many other pieces going on here.

524
00:57:50,700 --> 00:58:01,710
It was really a message that a lot of our friends are drawn.

525
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:06,600
I'm going to do what some people would like. Matthew White.

526
00:58:06,990 --> 00:58:12,930
Yeah, I think it's just, you know, she's coming here now.

527
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:20,160
Oh, she's aware and. Oh, yeah, I think so.

528
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:23,780
Yeah, I just got a message today.

529
00:58:24,450 --> 00:58:30,820
It was like, did you and I, we value the Redskins.

530
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:36,540
Doesn't matter what it used to be like a change.

531
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:40,000
Yeah. So I enjoy it.

532
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:45,930
It's okay. We can you see, you know. Oh, right.

533
00:58:46,170 --> 00:58:49,530
Literally, like so, you know.

534
00:58:53,940 --> 00:59:01,800
Yeah. Do you think? Well, I don't know. I think that I just want to.

535
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:09,240
I'm responsible. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

536
00:59:10,110 --> 00:59:15,560
I mean, we are all the time.

537
00:59:15,870 --> 00:59:18,900
Right? Oh, yeah.

538
00:59:19,330 --> 00:59:23,490
Sorry. You're not going to want to try.

539
00:59:24,450 --> 00:59:46,320
And I feel like it's like you're like and it does look like they live at the White House.

540
00:59:51,900 --> 01:00:21,930
So I'm pretty excited because we want to know what's going to happen because I think that I'm going to hold on just like many other governments,

541
01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:38,070
I don't have anything at all in one year.

542
01:00:38,580 --> 01:00:44,940
We just go on.

543
01:00:46,890 --> 01:00:59,379
I'm like my body. And I think that I think also the vice president I really know about and they have like I was in the same as last year,

544
01:00:59,380 --> 01:01:09,420
we might have been a lot worse because we have seen stupid increases.

545
01:01:11,790 --> 01:01:26,879
Hypothetically speaking, I think some of the institutions that are actually that you see here,

546
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:30,510
you can have all of the opportunities to help everybody.

547
01:01:31,590 --> 01:01:41,340
But I've got that. He really has to make your service operation public on its own.

548
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:51,350
You know what I mean?

549
01:01:51,360 --> 01:02:04,200
That's right. I just I think different ideas like.

550
01:02:06,270 --> 01:02:09,870
Oh, you mean like energy trade?

551
01:02:10,950 --> 01:02:23,280
Then I got my favorite guys for 300.

552
01:02:27,320 --> 01:03:00,010
You actually started feeling like, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

553
01:03:01,590 --> 01:03:04,940
Literally, just like, oh, that's not.

554
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:14,700
I just felt like, yeah, that was like what it was like.

555
01:03:19,230 --> 01:03:36,110
I mean, yeah, but it seems like it's just not directly or indirectly.

556
01:03:38,810 --> 01:04:04,920
So I got to tell you, that was a new project, but I guess he's working on his writing and I was like, Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

557
01:04:05,150 --> 01:04:32,470
I mean, I feel like I just feel like doing it and I'm not really sure how I felt like I was going to do something.

558
01:04:34,790 --> 01:05:07,670
Yeah, I was very excited because I like, I like this time of year, but I always think about what I'm like, although I know most of us back home.

559
01:05:07,830 --> 01:05:15,260
Yeah, yeah. Hopefully we've seen all the ads we're going to see and.

560
01:05:16,970 --> 01:05:21,740
Sierra, perhaps depressed, unmotivated, unhealthy.

561
01:05:23,610 --> 01:05:31,980
Based on my appearance, it's usually assumed that I'm lazy and unhealthy for my weight and my condition of life are self-inflicted.

562
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:39,390
That's not true. But often I don't get a second chance to make a first impression.

563
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:47,490
Now, the stereotypical perceptions that pop in people's minds when they see someone affected by obesity, that's weight bias.

564
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:55,780
And while a stranger's opinion of me like the woman in the grocery store who once made fun of my ankles might hurt my feelings.

565
01:05:57,820 --> 01:06:02,200
But weight bias that I've experience in health care has hurt me physically.

566
01:06:03,070 --> 01:06:10,000
When doctors and nurses have the perception that I'm lazy and unmotivated and non-compliant,

567
01:06:10,540 --> 01:06:15,460
that influences the care they provide and then have a negative impact on my health.

568
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:21,940
Now there is the Action Coalition, along with the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity.

569
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:31,160
Note that while there has been an increase in attention to obesity, little has been done to end the bias.

570
01:06:31,210 --> 01:06:34,270
The people affected by obesity experience in their everyday lives.

571
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:39,610
And that bias extends from the workplace to education to the health care system.

572
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:45,750
Now perhaps you're wondering how is my health?

573
01:06:46,930 --> 01:06:51,070
Metabolically speaking, I'm actually pretty healthy. I don't have diabetes.

574
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:57,190
I don't have sleep apnea. I don't have high blood pressure. So then why am I so that.

575
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:03,700
It's assumed that obesity is a self-inflicted condition due to poor lifestyle habits.

576
01:07:04,330 --> 01:07:08,710
I was actually born to be fat. My excess weight is caused by two conditions.

577
01:07:12,050 --> 01:07:18,110
The first one is Lipoedema. Lipoedema is the abnormal accumulation of adipose tissue fat.

578
01:07:18,770 --> 01:07:23,390
This adipose tissue accumulates in the legs, hips, thighs, sometimes upper arms.

579
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:32,090
It's a congenital condition that actually affects 11% of women, but it's usually mistaken for obesity and goes undiagnosed.

580
01:07:34,510 --> 01:07:44,610
But the name occurs in stages. And the next stages, including the advanced stages, including lymphedema,

581
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:51,720
basically the lymphedema that begins to crush lymphatic system, followed by the abnormal accumulation of fluid.

582
01:07:55,750 --> 01:07:58,780
Signs of plutonium are actually evident in pictures of me as a child.

583
01:07:59,230 --> 01:08:07,750
Yet I wasn't diagnosed sometimes in my twenties. By that time, my weight had soared over £500, and I did diagnosed at an earlier age.

584
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:14,730
I could have gotten treatment sooner. Had my doctors not been engaging in wait bars my entire childhood.

585
01:08:14,730 --> 01:08:20,010
My entire childhood. I might be telling a very different story today or might not be here at all.

586
01:08:22,110 --> 01:08:28,530
Least in his mind. Body mass index greater than 30 despite my obesity being due to the body mind lymphedema.

587
01:08:29,130 --> 01:08:32,730
I am and will forever be categorized as having obesity.

588
01:08:34,340 --> 01:08:42,230
Now, before I go any further, there's a lot of debate about whether or not obesity is a disease or due to poor lifestyle choices.

589
01:08:43,820 --> 01:08:47,180
Whether or not I could give a whole speech on that.

590
01:08:47,510 --> 01:08:50,840
But there are facts that are not debatable and that impact everyone.

591
01:08:53,420 --> 01:08:56,990
Obesity is an epidemic that affects one third of American adults.

592
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:02,060
Obesity accounts for 21% of overall U.S. health care expenditures.

593
01:09:02,870 --> 01:09:08,420
Businesses lose $4.3 billion. I hear about this stuff later in a B.S. related absenteeism.

594
01:09:09,350 --> 01:09:15,770
And despite all the money being spent fighting the war on obesity, obesity rates continue to rise.

595
01:09:17,930 --> 01:09:26,270
So why is this happening? I believe it's in part due to the fact that society and health care providers are blinded by bias.

596
01:09:28,660 --> 01:09:36,610
Instead of judging us, help us. The focus needs to be on the individual patient, not awareness.

597
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:41,260
We know work that we've been told for our entire lives.

598
01:09:41,890 --> 01:09:54,930
Do something to help us improve our health. 15 years ago, April year 2000, I went to the doctor seeking help for my legs.

599
01:09:55,890 --> 01:09:59,900
As you can see, they were abnormally large and they leaked limp.

600
01:10:01,110 --> 01:10:04,200
I was scared. I nearly lost my mobility.

601
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:12,520
I was housebound. Almost housebound. The doctor told me the problem was just my weight.

602
01:10:13,420 --> 01:10:18,399
She knew the problem was just my weight. Yet she didn't know how much I weighed a scale.

603
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:20,710
Her office didn't have a high enough capacity to weigh me.

604
01:10:21,580 --> 01:10:28,720
According to the Red Center, only one in 11 physician offices have a scale with a capacity beyond £300.

605
01:10:29,590 --> 01:10:39,510
Imagine stepping onto the scale and hearing that click and watching the nurse slide the weights all the way over and nothing happens right now.

606
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:45,880
First trying to be told to lose weight and not having a starting point to monitor or gauge any progress.

607
01:10:48,230 --> 01:10:53,150
I so desperately wanted to know why wait? I went to a junkyard to weigh myself.

608
01:10:54,470 --> 01:10:59,930
Now, like one of the richest countries in the world, a country that's $3 trillion on health care.

609
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:04,580
And I had to resort to a junkyard to get vital medical information.

610
01:11:05,330 --> 01:11:09,920
That's way biased. And it's not just a lack of scale.

611
01:11:10,010 --> 01:11:14,770
There's also lack of seating. And larger gowns and equipment.

612
01:11:15,010 --> 01:11:20,020
I often find that doctor's offices can't properly take my blood pressure if they

613
01:11:20,020 --> 01:11:25,030
don't have a large cuff or the staff on a train to take a manual reading on my arms.

614
01:11:25,930 --> 01:11:30,820
Weight and blood pressure are two basic yet very important vital signs.

615
01:11:31,180 --> 01:11:35,770
Yet I go without having them documented or monitored or documented properly.

616
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:48,340
Now, on a positive note, I have noticed larger seating and waiting rooms only to find this in the exam room so I can be waiting comfortably.

617
01:11:49,060 --> 01:11:55,920
But I can't get given properly. And I don't know about you, but I can't be the only one who has trouble getting up on these things.

618
01:11:56,190 --> 01:11:58,320
I'm not just overweight. I'm also under tall.

619
01:12:00,010 --> 01:12:10,750
I so I want to speak up about this because you have a heads up and I've had tests canceled because I wait too much for the equipment.

620
01:12:11,630 --> 01:12:15,200
Okay if I can't have the test and have my doctor to make a diagnosis.

621
01:12:15,890 --> 01:12:24,230
And so I'm concerned. I speak up and I'm told I shouldn't be I shouldn't expect to be accommodated for my poor lifestyle choices.

622
01:12:25,300 --> 01:12:33,340
Well, that's weight bias. I'm told that doctors and hospitals shouldn't have to buy expensive equipment for just a few patients.

623
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:37,870
That's weight bias. And since when is one third of American adults?

624
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:41,110
A few patients. And just so you know.

625
01:12:43,350 --> 01:12:48,030
I can buy a scale on Amazon for $50 with a high enough weight capacity to weigh myself.

626
01:12:49,380 --> 01:12:57,540
Yet doctors and health care providers use the expensive burden of treating obesity to defend their inadequate care.

627
01:12:59,900 --> 01:13:05,450
Well, that's weight bias. I'm not trying. I'm not asking to be able to ride a roller coaster at a theme park.

628
01:13:06,050 --> 01:13:09,780
I'm trying to save my life. Now.

629
01:13:09,780 --> 01:13:14,170
So to go back, I was on this journey. I was trying to get healthy.

630
01:13:14,220 --> 01:13:17,840
I was going to different doctor's appointments. No one was really helping me.

631
01:13:17,850 --> 01:13:22,710
I just kept being told to lose weight. No one was really giving me, you know, they had me at 1200 calories.

632
01:13:22,740 --> 01:13:27,900
I just I've never tried a diet before. But also the bills start coming in.

633
01:13:28,860 --> 01:13:33,120
And I ask the insurance company, is the mine payment for my appointments?

634
01:13:34,670 --> 01:13:38,450
So I call them and I'm told we don't cover cosmetic care.

635
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:45,830
And I'm like, I don't know what you think I have done, but there's nothing cosmetic about this.

636
01:13:46,820 --> 01:13:51,930
Oh, no, ma'am. We don't cover the treatment of obesity. Okay.

637
01:13:53,510 --> 01:13:56,510
Even when the appointments had nothing to do with the weight loss,

638
01:13:57,200 --> 01:14:01,400
they were denied simply because the diagnosis CO two obesity was attached to the claim.

639
01:14:01,970 --> 01:14:04,370
And again, I'm always going to have that diagnosis code.

640
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:12,800
Now, the Affordable Care Act actually has a mandate to include the screening and counseling for obesity.

641
01:14:14,210 --> 01:14:18,740
But simply put, that means your doctor has to weigh you, document your BMI and tell you to lose weight.

642
01:14:19,370 --> 01:14:24,590
There's no mandate that insurance companies actually have to cover the cost of a treatment of obesity.

643
01:14:25,430 --> 01:14:29,930
And while there's not supposed to be any denial of coverage for preexisting conditions,

644
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:35,420
insurers are still permitted to exclude coverage for obesity from their policies.

645
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:45,980
How does that help decrease obesity rates? So I ended up back home on this journey trying to get healthy.

646
01:14:46,280 --> 01:14:52,519
I finally had to advocate for myself and, you know, do the size my legs.

647
01:14:52,520 --> 01:15:00,950
Regular exercise wasn't happening. So I asked my doctor to send me to physical therapy and she agreed to physical therapy.

648
01:15:00,950 --> 01:15:02,330
And I start working out the water.

649
01:15:02,990 --> 01:15:10,580
And actually during this time also I saw another doctor who when that doctor instantly saw my legs, asked me what they were doing for my leg edema.

650
01:15:10,970 --> 01:15:15,290
I'd never heard the word before. It took a doctor looking at me to know what I had.

651
01:15:17,020 --> 01:15:20,320
So finally I'm working out the water. I'm actually getting a compression treatment.

652
01:15:20,350 --> 01:15:21,790
I have motivation, I hope.

653
01:15:23,580 --> 01:15:31,200
Years later, the water aerobics is like a treatment and exercise is what I did, like my primary form of exercise for ten years.

654
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:35,820
So in 2000, when I was really scared because one night after water aerobics,

655
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:40,620
so getting short of breath, it was very unusual and it lingered for a few days.

656
01:15:40,710 --> 01:15:43,800
And so I went to my doctor, new doctor at the time, great doctor.

657
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:47,520
And she was concerned also. She sent me to a pulmonologist.

658
01:15:48,630 --> 01:15:53,670
Powerful knowledge just walks in the room and greets me by saying, Oh, I know why you're short of breath.

659
01:15:53,670 --> 01:16:00,110
You were over there in the town. I don't even need to examine you. That's weight bias.

660
01:16:01,180 --> 01:16:05,200
And while he did run a few tests, which were the tests my doctor wanted him to run,

661
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:10,900
he concluded I was allergic to grass and you never know grass or dogs.

662
01:16:11,020 --> 01:16:19,720
At the pool that evening, I'm quite sure. But since all my other tests were normal, he said, just keep on losing weight.

663
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:24,700
Well, the doctor found it easier said than done.

664
01:16:25,180 --> 01:16:29,140
If my main former exercises wasn't causing me to be abnormally short of breath.

665
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:33,940
And what was my phone? Shocking. It's not. It happens all the time.

666
01:16:34,420 --> 01:16:40,300
Research shows that the weight bias in health care extends from physicians to nurses to even medical students.

667
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:52,420
When doctors were surveyed, they indicated the higher the patient's BMI, the less desire they had to treat them.

668
01:16:54,010 --> 01:16:55,360
When nurses were surveyed.

669
01:16:57,480 --> 01:17:05,340
31% indicated they preferred not to be patients affected by obesity studies and fully, rationally repulsed by such patients.

670
01:17:05,980 --> 01:17:13,290
Repulsed are repulsed by the fact that 50 more than 50% of nurses admit to engaging in weight bias.

671
01:17:14,070 --> 01:17:18,420
So it's not a surprise that on the flip side, patients affected by obesity.

672
01:17:19,570 --> 01:17:26,500
Are less likely to get preventive care or cancer screenings and are more likely to cancel appointments or delay treatment.

673
01:17:27,310 --> 01:17:33,070
I mean, no wonder it's embarrassing not to be able to get laid or get up on a damn table.

674
01:17:33,730 --> 01:17:37,930
It's frustrating to have insurance denied coverage for your health care,

675
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:45,010
and it's infuriating to have every splinter and stuffy nose going on just your weight.

676
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:50,610
But delaying care only worsens an already poor state of health.

677
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:57,120
So once we as patients get to the point of seeking care, we need a higher level of care.

678
01:17:58,230 --> 01:18:03,630
And we got it. Wait. Bias is preventing us from getting basic care like our blood pressure and weight taken.

679
01:18:04,610 --> 01:18:09,860
We're not going to get a higher level of care when needed until the cycle just continues.

680
01:18:12,140 --> 01:18:20,420
We've been ignored by health care when taking the blame for being a public, public health and economic burden.

681
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:29,400
I was born to be fat. But despite the reason for obesity, all patients deserve access to health care.

682
01:18:29,820 --> 01:18:33,960
And to have that can deliver in a respectful and dignified manner.

683
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:43,340
So whether you're a health care professional, an employer or a friend or family member of someone affected by obesity,

684
01:18:44,180 --> 01:18:49,700
I hope you have a better perspective of how we're viewed within the medical

685
01:18:49,700 --> 01:18:54,230
community and the additional challenges we face when trying to access health care.

686
01:18:56,980 --> 01:19:01,300
Healthy and weight bias in the bias and treat the patient.

687
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:10,670
Thank you. Reactions.

688
01:19:15,720 --> 01:19:23,180
To summarize a lot of what I said in a much more compelling way. So I give you the dry intro and then she mail that, which is heartbreaking.

689
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:26,270
And other people actually do that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

690
01:19:26,470 --> 01:19:30,000
To hear someone talk about going to a junkyard to get weight, I feel like sticks with me every time.

691
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:34,000
Just lots of times. Like, it's just so dehumanizing.

692
01:19:34,090 --> 01:19:43,239
Yeah, I think it's frustrating to know that people are delayed the actual care they need and that's a long time, she said.

693
01:19:43,240 --> 01:19:55,270
It took 20 years for her to get a diagnosis, but it's not okay for Annapurna to say Lipoedema Lipoedema has such a visual presentation, right?

694
01:19:55,270 --> 01:20:03,460
This is not a a cancer or autoimmune disease or something that it's actually quite hard to screen for visually.

695
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:11,230
Something like Lipoedema should be pretty straightforward to add to your differential diagnosis.

696
01:20:11,230 --> 01:20:15,660
So it feels particularly shocking that it took her that long to get that this happened.

697
01:20:15,940 --> 01:20:20,709
Yeah, I was definitely shocked about that because like even when I first saw my first thought was, Oh, she has the amount.

698
01:20:20,710 --> 01:20:28,480
Yeah. But I was really shocked too about the insurance aspect of it and like how like she wasn't covered.

699
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:34,840
It's just insane. Yeah. And doctors are trained to kind of add a lot of diagnosis codes in order to

700
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:39,670
maximize billing and sort of the implications of when you bill for something,

701
01:20:39,940 --> 01:20:48,190
how and whether it gets covered. What you see like there is sort of kind of a lot underneath it and it became the like the fat broken up syndrome.

702
01:20:48,190 --> 01:20:51,249
It's like this visit was about obesity. No, it was actually about this.

703
01:20:51,250 --> 01:20:56,409
But it gives license to to not cover something.

704
01:20:56,410 --> 01:21:01,930
And this is when we talk later in the course about the should this be a disease or not or a diagnosis.

705
01:21:02,920 --> 01:21:08,229
There are sort of pros and cons and this is sort of kind of a complicated piece of the ACA Band-Aid,

706
01:21:08,230 --> 01:21:13,630
is that if you have to document it, sort of what are the implications related to cost and coverage?

707
01:21:14,650 --> 01:21:17,379
It was really frustrating to hear like the pull analogies,

708
01:21:17,380 --> 01:21:22,000
like without even looking at her or even like talking to her, just like making this assumption.

709
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:27,700
And I feel like as a society there's all these like unsolicited comments that come out of our weight.

710
01:21:27,700 --> 01:21:30,970
Even though no one asked you to make those comments in the first place,

711
01:21:30,980 --> 01:21:35,740
that was really just like dripping with arrogance and like, thinness and privilege.

712
01:21:35,740 --> 01:21:43,220
And it's just so upsetting. You could imagine it happening and it's just just terrible, right?

713
01:21:43,270 --> 01:21:45,049
Just to be in that position,

714
01:21:45,050 --> 01:21:50,500
to think I'm offering a service to this patient and it tells you a lot about what this doctor thought about this person's life,

715
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:54,340
if that was the intervention they wanted to deliver. Yeah, yeah.

716
01:21:54,340 --> 01:22:03,070
I just thought it was telling that she showed the example of being able to buy scale on Amazon for $50 that would accommodate her weight.

717
01:22:03,730 --> 01:22:11,340
And yeah, it's just like I feel like costs and availability are so often used as excuses, right?

718
01:22:12,130 --> 01:22:16,510
And there are times where it is true things will cost more, will take up more space.

719
01:22:16,510 --> 01:22:20,680
And there are times where that's a full red herring.

720
01:22:20,680 --> 01:22:25,990
It is nonsense, right? Like our technology in terms of weighing bodies is a real advance like this.

721
01:22:27,910 --> 01:22:31,899
People have an Apple Watch, you know, their blood pressure and pulse right now. Like, why on earth are we not able to?

722
01:22:31,900 --> 01:22:40,060
And not that it's like as accurate as equipment in office, but we can't continue to think that that's actually a valid excuse.

723
01:22:40,930 --> 01:22:50,979
But it also, I think, strikes out from a structural business standpoint how a lot of decisions are not made on maximizing care,

724
01:22:50,980 --> 01:22:56,680
but on how many people can we afford to kill before we fix something.

725
01:22:56,680 --> 01:23:03,880
That's how car companies work in auto insurance works, actuaries and some level health care administration.

726
01:23:04,450 --> 01:23:09,999
And because like that, like I was thinking the other day, I needed an MRI machine on a special high powered machine.

727
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:20,740
There's only one that I could go to. And the entire system like including clinics and it has a weight limit and it's, I think, something around 550.

728
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:22,450
And that's a decision that.

729
01:23:23,580 --> 01:23:31,559
The people that built that machine made of like, how many people are we willing to accommodate and to potentially let die if they couldn't?

730
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:32,700
Because like the other day,

731
01:23:32,700 --> 01:23:41,520
mine got canceled because an emergency case came in that needed that to receive the emergency care to survive the day that person had been over £550.

732
01:23:41,530 --> 01:23:44,610
A person doesn't survive. That's the sort of survive.

733
01:23:44,630 --> 01:23:57,690
So yeah, I think that really drives home how money is used as an excuse to just like a few people is like not willing to be like not worth living.

734
01:23:57,730 --> 01:24:03,059
Yeah. And in medical decision making, in literature and economic literature,

735
01:24:03,060 --> 01:24:12,360
there is dollar metrics that we assign to what it is, what it takes to save someone.

736
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:18,719
How much does it cost? Like if you do a screening, for example, a set of a blood pressure screening, that's expensive, right?

737
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:22,049
In order to do that. And everyone. But who are we saving?

738
01:24:22,050 --> 01:24:27,060
How many life or years of high quality life are we getting back by catching things early?

739
01:24:27,450 --> 01:24:32,520
What does it cost to save that person or save someone additional year?

740
01:24:32,940 --> 01:24:34,679
There is a dollar sign associated with it.

741
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:39,209
And then there's like actually a line that says this is what we tend to think is worth the cost and not worth the cost.

742
01:24:39,210 --> 01:24:47,130
It's like the really ugly side of economics that we have to put a dollar sign on what kind of intervention is sort of worth the investment.

743
01:24:47,550 --> 01:24:52,200
But I think there's a second layer to your specific example is like yes.

744
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:55,320
Or making decisions about how much are we willing to spend to save.

745
01:24:55,740 --> 01:24:58,080
But the question here is who are we willing to save?

746
01:24:58,680 --> 01:25:05,010
And it's deciding that someone who weighs over £550, for example, we're willing to spend not a cent more.

747
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:10,919
Right. We will buy this fancy equipment and put a huge investment in our in our thinner patients.

748
01:25:10,920 --> 01:25:17,879
But these people are not even on the table. And conversations that were similar to this came up in early hope it again like who deserves

749
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:22,740
ventilators like who who are we saving are be saving old people are saving fat people.

750
01:25:23,010 --> 01:25:26,489
And so this is a really dark side of medical decision making.

751
01:25:26,490 --> 01:25:31,830
But it is it is a conversation that happens in a time with limited resources.

752
01:25:31,830 --> 01:25:38,790
And we like to think that the decisions are made equitably where issues related to bias are fully considered.

753
01:25:45,030 --> 01:25:48,060
So to summarize the medical stuff.

754
01:25:50,990 --> 01:25:54,020
I think the point of I'm hoping to drive home today is that weight statement.

755
01:25:54,020 --> 01:25:58,190
Health care settings is common. We see it across health care professionals.

756
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:04,390
And this is impacting the health of patients with their bodies and it's leading to health care avoidance.

757
01:26:05,490 --> 01:26:11,139
Right. And as I said, today's session has a little bit of a bummer because I'm just talking to you about like what exists, what we know exists.

758
01:26:11,140 --> 01:26:18,460
And we'll talk about solutions and other stuff more later on in the course. But wait, bias is not a rare problem within health care settings.

759
01:26:20,580 --> 01:26:25,710
There's not too much data to talk about in the public health space, but I'm going to talk about public health because that's where we are.

760
01:26:26,370 --> 01:26:28,260
So the first speck of good news,

761
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:35,459
I did a study a couple of years ago that wanted to quantify weight bias and public health trainees that we have studies of medical students,

762
01:26:35,460 --> 01:26:39,550
of nurses, of dietetic students. But there has never been a study of public health trainees.

763
01:26:39,570 --> 01:26:43,140
What's the bias look like in you all or in those folks?

764
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:53,159
And we're doing much better. So in terms of measurements related to the extent to which we understand weight is not fully controllable,

765
01:26:53,160 --> 01:26:57,750
where we understand environmental engineer contributors to body weight.

766
01:26:57,780 --> 01:27:02,490
Public health has our training as a public health in this institution because obviously as our students,

767
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:08,520
we have lower levels of anti fat attitudes relative to studies of health care professionals.

768
01:27:09,030 --> 01:27:16,140
So that was good news. The less good news part of the study is that levels of internalization of weight bias was still super high.

769
01:27:17,020 --> 01:27:20,770
So public health folks thought that it is a highly controllable it's a social.

770
01:27:20,870 --> 01:27:24,070
You know, there are social determinants of health that affect weight. That was sort of understood.

771
01:27:24,370 --> 01:27:30,040
But the extent to which people felt like they themselves should look a particular way or they had their

772
01:27:30,040 --> 01:27:35,139
own guilt related to their bodies and sort of thought negatively about themselves because their bodies.

773
01:27:35,140 --> 01:27:39,650
It was just like any other study of a health care professional or a regular college student.

774
01:27:39,670 --> 01:27:43,540
So there's some good news, bad news in terms of who is going into public health.

775
01:27:45,570 --> 01:27:49,090
And we can think about examples that way by some public health.

776
01:27:49,090 --> 01:27:53,530
There are many. I'm going to start with the sort of punch line and then talk about this stuff.

777
01:27:53,770 --> 01:27:57,760
There's actually not that many studies that look at weight bias in public health campaigns.

778
01:27:57,770 --> 01:27:59,440
I'm going to talk about just two studies.

779
01:28:00,190 --> 01:28:08,049
But if you look around, I'm going to start asking you to be looking around for examples of weight bias in lots of spaces, including public health.

780
01:28:08,050 --> 01:28:11,710
If you look for examples, there are sort of all around us,

781
01:28:11,740 --> 01:28:22,569
this is a sort of a notorious campaign that was it was the Georgia or Atlanta Health Department that put out this really sort of

782
01:28:22,570 --> 01:28:31,930
doom and gloom campaign where they showed that kids with sort of like this harsh lighting and kind of really sort of negative,

783
01:28:31,930 --> 01:28:36,489
nasty language. They made billboards. They got a lot of criticism for this campaign.

784
01:28:36,490 --> 01:28:41,650
And it has long been taken down by sort of using that kids as like.

785
01:28:42,860 --> 01:28:48,500
Poster child about things like that was something a public health organization thoughtfully comfortable doing.

786
01:28:49,110 --> 01:28:53,720
And I think it's just an example of this idea of using sort of fat bodies as

787
01:28:54,050 --> 01:28:58,100
a warning label is something you actually see quite a lot in public health.

788
01:28:58,220 --> 01:29:02,570
So what you see might include harsh or stereotypical imagery.

789
01:29:02,570 --> 01:29:06,110
We use stigmatizing language for sure related to body size.

790
01:29:06,620 --> 01:29:12,560
There's a lot of weight centric health promotion discourse by perhaps super well-meaning public health people,

791
01:29:12,860 --> 01:29:17,870
but there's just a lot of focus on weight within this discourse messages of personal responsibility,

792
01:29:18,950 --> 01:29:24,050
lack of acknowledgment of the complex etiology of weight, lack of acknowledgment of natural size, diversity.

793
01:29:24,710 --> 01:29:28,070
People are going to be variable in terms of their weight and height.

794
01:29:28,640 --> 01:29:35,810
That is the world we live in. Right. That is that is a fact that has been true in all of time in sort of acknowledging that not

795
01:29:35,810 --> 01:29:39,350
everyone is supposed to be thin is something you don't actually hear so much in public health.

796
01:29:40,100 --> 01:29:46,070
There's lots of pathologies. Where we think about large bodies is always bad, weight gain is inherently bad,

797
01:29:46,340 --> 01:29:52,670
and messages that really privilege are overvalue, thinness and weight loss.

798
01:29:53,540 --> 01:29:57,200
So this is anecdotally what I see, but again, not a lot of studies of it.

799
01:29:58,190 --> 01:30:05,210
One study where researchers were looking to understand what are our public health campaigns doing?

800
01:30:05,690 --> 01:30:10,610
They queried different health departments, public health departments across the world.

801
01:30:11,030 --> 01:30:18,770
So it wasn't just U.S. studies and looked at what types of public health campaigns were out there in the space of the person in weight.

802
01:30:19,340 --> 01:30:25,700
And they asked parents to react to the various types of campaigns like what does this message make you think?

803
01:30:25,700 --> 01:30:30,210
What does this message make you do? And they again, this is parents perceptions.

804
01:30:30,240 --> 01:30:33,350
It's not like a perfect study in terms of how does it actually affect health.

805
01:30:33,770 --> 01:30:40,040
But what they learned is that campaigns are stigmatizing messages we're most negatively rated by parents,

806
01:30:40,040 --> 01:30:44,690
and they reported the lowest intention to comply with messages when they were linked to negativity.

807
01:30:45,320 --> 01:30:49,700
So video, these are real public health campaigns, right? They do not make up sham campaigns.

808
01:30:49,700 --> 01:30:57,830
These were literally taken from public health departments. And so as a parent, so there was a campaign that said child obesity is child abuse.

809
01:30:58,870 --> 01:31:02,710
Being fat takes the fun out of the kid. Skip seconds lose your gut.

810
01:31:03,400 --> 01:31:04,740
Very motivating messages here.

811
01:31:04,770 --> 01:31:14,890
So this study, probably not surprisingly, supported this notion that really shady blamey campaigns do not evoke feelings of motivation or goodness.

812
01:31:15,700 --> 01:31:23,800
In the same study, they found that the studies that were or the messages that were received most positively had no mention of the word obesity.

813
01:31:24,130 --> 01:31:28,830
And it just focused on health behaviors, things like every day eat a variety of fruits and vegetables,

814
01:31:28,840 --> 01:31:32,020
focus on behavior, not pathologies of body sizes.

815
01:31:32,530 --> 01:31:36,219
So this is one hint of where we might be focusing efforts.

816
01:31:36,220 --> 01:31:40,360
And public health is on messages that people are going to be more receptive to.

817
01:31:41,890 --> 01:31:47,799
There's one tiny study that was published two years ago or 25 years ago at this point that was trying to

818
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:54,080
understand how to craft public health messages in a way that would be motivating and not stigmatizing.

819
01:31:54,120 --> 01:31:58,180
And it's like a lab based study that used college students.

820
01:31:59,020 --> 01:32:03,790
But I thought it sort of is an interesting design where they paired messages of

821
01:32:03,790 --> 01:32:10,540
personal responsibility and stigmatizing images in a in a two by two design.

822
01:32:10,540 --> 01:32:14,570
And so you could get a stigmatizing image as this sort of headless person, right?

823
01:32:14,590 --> 01:32:19,180
A headless person, fat body, doing stereotypical things. That's a stigmatizing image.

824
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:26,380
This one is less stigmatizing because it's not focused on the person, but is focused on the environment.

825
01:32:26,680 --> 01:32:29,860
And then the message was either really forceful.

826
01:32:30,220 --> 01:32:31,900
It says, do it because you have to.

827
01:32:31,900 --> 01:32:40,270
And that it talked about health behaviors where they had a non forceful message or a message that was more empathic and more autonomy, supportive.

828
01:32:40,630 --> 01:32:47,170
This is why not give it a try. So again, this is just one study in a college student sample,

829
01:32:47,170 --> 01:32:57,220
but they found that this one was the most effective in terms of its impact on food choices and on concerns related to stigma.

830
01:32:57,250 --> 01:33:00,040
So the combination of like, let's not focus on the individual.

831
01:33:00,040 --> 01:33:08,530
Individual focus on the environment is stigmatizing images, but then also being a less forceful guilt, shame, blame.

832
01:33:10,030 --> 01:33:13,719
Uh, what's word of mouth for ultimatums?

833
01:33:13,720 --> 01:33:18,040
That kind of stuff is not changing health in a in a long term way.

834
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:26,780
Questions on that. So it's a short segment on public health.

835
01:33:26,780 --> 01:33:28,519
I think there is a lot of weight guys out there.

836
01:33:28,520 --> 01:33:39,590
We just have a measure that, yeah, so be on the lookout for examples of this that might, you might be exposed to in the context of your training here.

837
01:33:40,760 --> 01:33:47,000
So where we're heading next week is moving to examples of weight bias outside of health care and public health.

838
01:33:47,450 --> 01:33:51,829
Again, it's going to feel like another a little bit about giving gloom, collecting examples of bad ness.

839
01:33:51,830 --> 01:33:54,890
But again, we'll move ahead from that after after next week.

840
01:33:55,790 --> 01:34:03,110
There's one reading called Everyday Indignities. You are going to watch a documentary called Attitude.

841
01:34:04,040 --> 01:34:08,480
It's a really excellent it's a really excellent documentary.

842
01:34:08,780 --> 01:34:13,340
The last 20 minutes go a little bit off the rails. So when it starts doing that, just like I warned you.

843
01:34:13,690 --> 01:34:20,080
But they give examples of weight bias in the media and they do it a really compelling way.

844
01:34:20,090 --> 01:34:25,100
You see lots of Disney clips and you'll be sort of horrified by how Disney has brainwashed us in a weight bias way.

845
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:29,420
But it's an engaging it's an engaging documentary for sure.

846
01:34:29,810 --> 01:34:33,470
It is posted on kanopy. Are folks familiar with using Kjellberg?

847
01:34:34,340 --> 01:34:38,690
So Kanopy is a it's like a streaming service for documentaries.

848
01:34:38,690 --> 01:34:42,890
You has full access and you cannot believe the great content here.

849
01:34:43,430 --> 01:34:52,339
So if you don't know kanopy be browsing there, but if you are logged in with your UMass stuff, you should be able to to access it.

850
01:34:52,340 --> 01:34:59,479
And there's lots of famous people in there. Lizzie West is in there, guy on other fancy famous people that are not coming to my mind right now.

851
01:34:59,480 --> 01:35:05,270
But so watch gratitude, read the everyday indignities and then you have actual work to do.

852
01:35:06,290 --> 01:35:09,380
So next week, reflection number one is do.

853
01:35:10,280 --> 01:35:15,889
And what you are going to talk about is examples of weight bias that you've seen or heard about.

854
01:35:15,890 --> 01:35:19,160
It can be in public health. So I guess we're coming to your brain.

855
01:35:19,160 --> 01:35:28,639
As I was talking about weight bias and public health, you could share those examples if you've seen them in movies and physical spaces.

856
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:32,550
I just want you all to be thinking about where have you seen weight bias?

857
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:36,500
So the reflection is short, so it's 400 to 600 words.

858
01:35:37,310 --> 01:35:43,940
I want this to be sort of a dump up. These are some ideas I have shared 2 to 3 examples of weight bias across any domain.

859
01:35:43,940 --> 01:35:46,909
It can be really overt, it can be structural, it can be micro-aggressions,

860
01:35:46,910 --> 01:35:52,910
whatever you think of as weight bias and explain why you consider these examples

861
01:35:52,910 --> 01:35:56,000
weight bias and where you encounter them or where you might encounter them.

862
01:35:56,030 --> 01:35:59,419
They can be hypothetical for the examples you share.

863
01:35:59,420 --> 01:36:04,220
What response or corrective action might you recommend to prevent further harm?

864
01:36:04,310 --> 01:36:12,860
And the corrective action can be from the target, from bystander ads for people in positions of individual of a power or authority.

865
01:36:13,730 --> 01:36:18,740
So we haven't learned this yet, right? You haven't learned what's the right way to react to weight bias?

866
01:36:19,100 --> 01:36:22,190
To some extent, it's not a totally answered question.

867
01:36:22,490 --> 01:36:28,520
But I want you just to be thinking about like give in a particular instance of weight bias, like what comes to mind.

868
01:36:28,580 --> 01:36:31,880
Like who could stop that from happening, who could prevent harm in the moment?

869
01:36:32,780 --> 01:36:36,740
So write those things out, submit it and canvas.

870
01:36:37,880 --> 01:36:43,280
It should be this length. It should have no spelling errors and stuff like that.

871
01:36:43,280 --> 01:36:47,509
But other than that, I don't I'm not expecting for like crazy polish.

872
01:36:47,510 --> 01:36:51,050
I'm expecting for an idea and some critical thinking about what might we do about this.

873
01:36:53,530 --> 01:37:00,940
Questions on the task at hand. A reading, a very fun video.

874
01:37:01,720 --> 01:37:06,480
I you have ideas. All right.

875
01:37:06,490 --> 01:37:10,860
So for the rest of our time, get into groups.

876
01:37:10,870 --> 01:37:16,210
I think everyone has a group. If you are not in a group, come find me.

877
01:37:17,260 --> 01:37:23,260
For folks who had submitted preferences before early evening yesterday, I think you've got your first or your second choice.

878
01:37:23,260 --> 01:37:27,130
After that, you probably got not your first or second choice.

879
01:37:28,090 --> 01:37:31,690
But if you're in a group where you can actually not do that day, we need to course correct quickly.

880
01:37:31,690 --> 01:37:37,269
So let me know that a.S.A.P and I will.

881
01:37:37,270 --> 01:37:42,459
What you guys are in your groups. I will pull up the description of the assignments you can be looking at as you talk.

882
01:37:42,460 --> 01:37:46,240
If you want to be staring at your own screen and then just flag me down with questions that you have.

883
01:37:49,010 --> 01:37:52,050
All right. Do you want me to? I feel like you guys can find each other. I'm just going to.

884
01:37:52,070 --> 01:37:55,700
I'm just going to, like, let you all take the wheel of how you find each other.

885
01:37:55,760 --> 01:38:18,160
I mean, you know, people together, you know, you might decide that I was expecting more sounding like intersectionality group.

886
01:38:21,560 --> 01:38:25,200
Yeah, I'm good. I'm area. Yeah.

887
01:38:25,770 --> 01:38:29,120
Yeah. Okay. Okay.

888
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:34,860
Um, just listening to any of that the last three or four years.

889
01:38:35,110 --> 01:38:40,879
Yeah. And like, I'm, I'm just like, oh, I think.

890
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:46,090
Okay, so let me ask you to go find that better.

891
01:38:46,190 --> 01:38:49,759
I shouldn't be because like, I would, it's like I don't know anyone here.

892
01:38:49,760 --> 01:38:55,280
I don't want to me out here to seek pleasure.

893
01:38:59,270 --> 01:39:03,370
Okay, okay. Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

894
01:39:04,310 --> 01:39:07,820
Okay. I'm really excited.

895
01:39:08,660 --> 01:39:22,340
Oh, sorry. Am I right? Every last place where I went to help everyone find their people, I'm going to pull up the assignment description.

896
01:39:23,730 --> 01:39:41,750
Oh, yeah. That's like the only one other thing quote where I have not made this link live.

897
01:39:41,750 --> 01:39:47,209
Yeah, you can start signing up for what podcasts we're going to do a.s.a.p.

898
01:39:47,210 --> 01:39:49,430
I will fix that in the next 3 hours.

899
01:39:49,430 --> 01:39:54,469
So once I make that link live, I'll send you announcements saying if you know specifically what podcast you're going to do,

900
01:39:54,470 --> 01:39:58,520
start signing up so we don't have six rooms presenting the same exact episode.

901
01:40:00,560 --> 01:40:05,720
And it's one of the reasons I write it.

902
01:40:08,040 --> 01:40:17,310
I just have to get some ideas and educate as a reminder, he said.

903
01:40:17,500 --> 01:40:25,350
I sit on the topic of the week. If it doesn't match perfectly, that is fine with me right now.

904
01:40:26,430 --> 01:40:37,399
But I'm super excited about. I guess you could just simply offer something else that we could also talk about.

905
01:40:37,400 --> 01:40:46,130
So I like my words. Yeah, I know.

906
01:40:46,910 --> 01:40:52,040
I'm sorry. I was thinking, like, in 2 hours.

907
01:40:52,040 --> 01:40:55,180
Are you sure? I know.

908
01:40:56,810 --> 01:41:02,010
Yeah, I was just recently. Yeah, I guess.

909
01:41:04,460 --> 01:41:09,760
I have no idea about my preferences.

910
01:41:11,210 --> 01:41:21,060
I don't know what you have brought. We have no idea what he's saying to us.

911
01:41:21,500 --> 01:41:26,960
It's not like that. I mean, they're trying to it nice, but we can't see them up there.

912
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:33,030
Oh. Oh, right. Like very small, intimate laptops that could make it.

913
01:41:33,050 --> 01:41:36,380
Well, I don't know why we're not really.

914
01:41:36,420 --> 01:41:41,200
Because we don't really have to play on words. I couldn't.

915
01:41:41,210 --> 01:41:48,110
You know, I. I.

916
01:41:49,030 --> 01:41:55,609
Well, maybe I can show you.

917
01:41:55,610 --> 01:41:59,599
Do not have to use one of these on the list. These are just podcasts I like or listen to.

918
01:41:59,600 --> 01:42:08,239
So it's a jumping off I don't know about Feels Relevant or Google podcasts really

919
01:42:08,240 --> 01:42:13,309
talking about like like how it varies between like really almost exquisite.

920
01:42:13,310 --> 01:42:26,480
But yeah, I guess I'll break down to write a book about personal experience that I haven't seen by myself.

921
01:42:29,090 --> 01:42:36,470
So this talks about the internal Israeli and Palestinian exchange and basically changing the norm.

922
01:42:38,460 --> 01:42:44,540
I know I have no idea how to do this.

923
01:42:44,540 --> 01:42:52,820
And I think the first thing when I saw that no, I think I understand amazingly things more like communication from this.

924
01:42:53,270 --> 01:42:59,400
But I use audacious bias.

925
01:43:00,450 --> 01:43:07,490
Like if I search to them. Yeah. I think they have a risk factor in this game.

926
01:43:08,330 --> 01:43:12,350
So yeah, I just knew something like this one time. But like I said, you guys, what's up?

927
01:43:12,350 --> 01:43:17,600
Because we're like an international messaging was against the airdrop system while here's another way

928
01:43:18,050 --> 01:43:27,379
they do it so yeah and that is like a lot of it is because they're like the real control and stuff.

929
01:43:27,380 --> 01:43:36,190
So it's, I guess we're learning from the past, but especially like that's the point of arrogance.

930
01:43:37,030 --> 01:43:40,759
Welcome and good for you. I hope you don't mind. No, I didn't say that.

931
01:43:40,760 --> 01:43:48,530
You know, prisoners are obviously stigmatized in a restaurant, but then it's not like it's a group that you feel stupid.

932
01:43:48,860 --> 01:43:57,930
Okay? I was like, I don't know if you like these guys, but so difficult for somebody.

933
01:43:58,790 --> 01:44:05,839
Okay. I'm like, if you let me start sharing. They also released a statement saying something.

934
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:12,590
So by asking that like five times that all of their cell phones, I forget my own name.

935
01:44:12,590 --> 01:44:17,210
Like all I guess I just don't know how to write my name. I do not like to have I just.

936
01:44:18,020 --> 01:44:23,300
I like my claim to be here.

937
01:44:23,560 --> 01:44:38,780
Yeah. Yeah. Like, I mean, I don't think you kind of like so many things really annoying related to his education foundation.

938
01:44:38,780 --> 01:44:49,429
He live now if you want to sign up for the first I might enjoy listening to you when you were

939
01:44:49,430 --> 01:45:00,560
saying it's like in Missouri when you've been talking about something like when I was in Missouri,

940
01:45:01,250 --> 01:45:06,380
you know, it's like a confusion.

941
01:45:08,210 --> 01:45:16,100
What I was like technically from of a major metropolitan area, just like sitting down for for ourselves in college, you know, you were from ten.

942
01:45:22,010 --> 01:45:33,610
I just want to look at any level so there's no rush in taking the podcast unless you're presenting in two weeks and there's probably about you.

943
01:45:33,650 --> 01:45:40,190
But I feel like a good use is to make sure you're clear what the task is, make sure you know each other.

944
01:45:40,260 --> 01:45:42,390
How to contact each other. General availability.

945
01:45:44,220 --> 01:46:04,110
I would say we are focusing on raising money, but this isn't just for this could be someone like me or like we're really a documentary type of person.

946
01:46:04,110 --> 01:46:10,370
Oh yeah. And how they don't really work. And so they're all mixing.

947
01:46:10,770 --> 01:46:19,470
And if we can make note of the last year, this year and then say whether or not like we think it would be good to talk about them.

948
01:46:20,340 --> 01:46:25,920
Each of the cases of society is going to be in the real world.

949
01:46:26,820 --> 01:46:35,150
So this is actually a very kind of you know what I mean?

950
01:46:36,120 --> 01:46:51,780
Like sometimes it's like these little pockets of bias study because that is telling us something that's safe in the area as well.

951
01:46:51,900 --> 01:46:59,490
And that's really like before this one.

952
01:47:00,150 --> 01:47:18,520
Oh, no, it's like it's amazing to me. I think, you know, if you want to hear from everybody, you know, I know.

953
01:47:19,820 --> 01:47:23,750
I think I hit return of excited about it.

954
01:47:24,460 --> 01:47:30,690
I just want to tell you, when I was trying to get talking to this was yeah.

955
01:47:31,440 --> 01:47:47,410
I just yeah I don't think I just heard this 48 minutes has double was yet again.

956
01:47:47,430 --> 01:47:57,970
Well given that maybe you like same thing in their jobs I guess maybe because the thing for children.

957
01:47:59,040 --> 01:48:05,790
Yeah because I know that sounds really good time to get a clue what is our time.

958
01:48:08,100 --> 01:48:23,670
We do little by little. It's like, oh yeah, what is going to be like three or 4000, 500,000 screwed up 21 solicitors last year?

959
01:48:24,210 --> 01:48:36,290
I would agree that I've been dreaming of, I guess some of the doctor, the cutter.

960
01:48:36,900 --> 01:48:41,450
This is probably the most thing about this time.

961
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,879
So definitely different sort of minority to it than some of the others.

962
01:48:44,880 --> 01:48:57,810
But we also know that like if you just want to promise you are texting like the most fun or even find anything interesting.

963
01:48:57,810 --> 01:49:01,350
Oh yeah, yeah. I just got to take a listen to a few of them.

964
01:49:01,350 --> 01:49:13,350
Yeah. Okay. So what are you free? I feel like if you listen to your day, like we're at about 250, which is what I would tell you.

965
01:49:13,350 --> 01:49:18,060
You all can go home, so you all can go home, but feel free to stay and chat if you would like to do that.

966
01:49:19,110 --> 01:49:22,140
Oh, that's why I like this one.

967
01:49:23,210 --> 01:49:38,190
This one? Sure. Yeah. Yeah. I was like, Oh, we've been to time, so I have to set the date of when we should have this four zero.

968
01:49:38,190 --> 01:49:42,210
So I was like, Oh yeah, we've seen that.

969
01:49:43,290 --> 01:49:48,389
I've seen a maybe start with you guys.

970
01:49:48,390 --> 01:49:51,600
Look, I'm. I'm driving home.

971
01:49:51,760 --> 01:49:56,620
Oh, yeah.
