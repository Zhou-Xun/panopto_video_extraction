1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:18,300
Right. All right.

2
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,490
So let's get started. Um, how can you.

3
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:27,690
Here? Uh. And so I'm very happy to start this exciting class.

4
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:31,080
Right. So my name is Song Yoon Park.

5
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:35,430
So I am Associate Professor in epidemiology and the HSC.

6
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:40,680
So this class is about data analysis.

7
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:47,190
But this is not statistics class. This is epidemiology class.

8
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:55,620
Okay. So I want to clarify that first. So if your goal is just learning statistics, please find another class.

9
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:05,970
This is epidemiological. So throughout this class, we will talk about a lot of this epidemiologic concept using environment exposure.

10
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:14,040
But to understand this relationship between exposures and outcome, we are using statistical actuaries.

11
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:21,000
Okay. So that's the bottom line of this class. So please make sure if this is a good fit for you.

12
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:25,020
And then this is the right course for you. Okay? All right.

13
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:31,520
So before I start this one, so and then I thank you for completing the survey.

14
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:39,210
So I now see. So what is your interest and then what you are looking for from this class?

15
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:46,710
But because this is our first class. So why don't we go around and then introduce each other?

16
00:01:46,800 --> 00:02:02,510
So from the front lines, why don't you start introduce us and then so you can say your name and then your department,

17
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:08,190
your degree program year and why you come here.

18
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:13,279
Okay. Okay. My name's Adam.

19
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:21,980
I'm a second year early stage as you come here.

20
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:28,160
Like, as in your interest. So your goal for this class after the end of that is class.

21
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:44,780
So what? I want to learn from this. Um, I guess I'd like to, I guess, improve my skills with some of the tools to be looking at in this class.

22
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:49,760
It pertains at least a little bit, probably to, I guess, my research as well.

23
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,240
Okay. All right, it's here.

24
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:58,360
Hi. I'm sitting here year.

25
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:11,680
I'm enjoying the party, so I want to drive this house because I was interested in how the different kinds of environmental pollutants,

26
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:18,280
defamation effects and the new modeling method in this area.

27
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:23,800
So, all right. So I mean, I did one answering.

28
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:31,270
I'm a second year student to an MPH program and I guess similar to history.

29
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:38,110
I also want to learn how to model environmental exposures because in a lot of classes they do other general public health stuff.

30
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:47,260
And I also want to learn more or something like what we learn in our bio standards classes in the future.

31
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:52,510
Hi, I'm Rebecca and I am also a second year MPH.

32
00:03:54,940 --> 00:04:03,519
And yeah, I, I'm excited to learn data analysis methods that are really specific to environmental exposures and especially

33
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:11,290
things that are really complicated to measure exposures relate to the types of mixtures of pollutants and.

34
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:18,420
Correct. Hi, my name's Mia. I'm the first year at the page system.

35
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:25,590
I'm excited for the class because I'm hoping to be exposed to some models that I haven't used in the past.

36
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:42,060
The first year he became. And Peter, I'm a second year student, environmental engineer, and you're going to improve my school in data analysis.

37
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:47,660
Okay. So inverted engineering. Okay. All right.

38
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:54,310
So my name is Pan and I'm not a secondary student in general, I presume.

39
00:04:54,340 --> 00:05:04,540
And the reason why I take this class is because I check the syllabus when I see this class, and I know it's very useful.

40
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:09,280
Mm hmm. I'm not sure. So the website of the syllabus is up to date.

41
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:13,450
So it's. Have the whole syllabus.

42
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:20,680
It's all the syllabus, right? So this year, I'm not sure if that's allowed to include the mixture analysis at the end.

43
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:25,720
So if that is not what you want.

44
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:31,060
But the point is so we have a new stuff this year which is good.

45
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:39,530
Right. Right. Victoria, also 70 year old students in general at the LNG.

46
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:46,630
I just want to learn something new about art and it's related to environment and technology.

47
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:54,879
Okay. And then so can you say and then after you speak and then if you are not or if you get a can,

48
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,630
you just pull your mask down and say, I can see your full face.

49
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:02,590
Okay. Um. Hi, everyone.

50
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:07,840
My name is the stitching, but I only refer to the caller, Catherine, because I'm not a cat.

51
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:17,290
I'm also a second year general AP student, and I'm actually doing now in AP with Dr. Xing one.

52
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:23,380
So I hope to learn more about this on. Good.

53
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,160
So you. You call by cab? Yeah.

54
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:32,260
Okay. All right. Hi, everyone.

55
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:38,360
My name is Swati. I'm a second year MBA student in the Environmental Health Sciences program.

56
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:44,840
I know it's not easy. So I because I am from Environmental Health,

57
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:56,240
I would learn a lot about in the theoretical ways about environmental health and its effects of different environmental exposures.

58
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:02,179
I was hoping to explore a bit of environmental epidemiology this semester,

59
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:13,910
so I did see if I also had episode six and six on the environment because I thought doing this along with that course would also be helpful.

60
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:17,569
Welcome. Yeah. Hi, everyone.

61
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:22,130
When I made suggestion and I was sitting around student I'll let you track.

62
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:32,570
And the reason why I took this concept because I remember something about an American epidemiologist role this summer and for my our new project,

63
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:42,260
but they're always wanting to learn. So I took this class and hope to learn more about environmental and especially the mixture analysis.

64
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:45,680
So that's exciting. That sounds great.

65
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:53,180
Although the meta analysis is only one week at the end of the book before we get there.

66
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:58,310
So that's why before we get there, we need to along many other thing.

67
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:03,080
And so I'll we'll talk about the overall structure of this class later.

68
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:10,010
Great. Okay. James, I don't think you're a wee subject.

69
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:19,960
And I was thinking perhaps if I had invented every intelligence and had one,

70
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:31,880
because I read in very used to learn more about those models and that those things are true.

71
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:39,980
Oh, great. Yeah. And at some point, I think we will have a chance to briefly talk about X Puzzle.

72
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:48,470
But at the end. All right. I'm married and I'm also a 17 year old student.

73
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:57,020
And I'm just excited to a personal person that we've learned in an environment like that.

74
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:04,400
That's great. Okay. All right. And Olivia, I'm going to second your post up in just a moment.

75
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:08,040
I think she was in nursing focus in environmental health,

76
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:13,770
so taking a number of statistical and hitting out of these classes and having environmental focus.

77
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:18,440
So we're excited about this class and to learn more about the non parametric models as well.

78
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:21,950
Great. Yes, that's what exactly this course is. Cover.

79
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:26,240
All right. I'm Alison Stewart.

80
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:33,260
Okay. And I'm taking the head of Epidemiology Focus Education this summer.

81
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:40,310
And I'm taking some assets I have like the environmental book is going to happen to your class that merges that.

82
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:43,940
So that's curious. What specific models are you studying?

83
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,080
Okay. All right. That's good. All right.

84
00:09:48,080 --> 00:10:03,229
So I can I can hear that. So you have a wide range of interest, but also I can also find that most of you want to learn about this statistical method.

85
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:09,440
But, you know, in the like the inverse of the has context and then how how involved exposure.

86
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:19,670
So collected data can be used to analyze and the link to the health outcome and then we can properly interpret the research.

87
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:24,200
So that is oral about this class and then this is the right classical.

88
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:32,950
So for you. All right. So then again, before I start this and I want to ask you one more question there.

89
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:36,370
So anyone want to share that?

90
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:47,760
So you have use. The environment has data, but you encounter some challenges in data analysis.

91
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:56,069
So that's why. What was the problem and the how you troubleshoot that before and then I want to hear that.

92
00:10:56,070 --> 00:11:01,230
So if this chorus can address that issue. Anyone want to share your experience?

93
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:11,410
Second year, now you are doing your AARP Prozac and now you are handling some of the index for the data.

94
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:18,350
Right. Or is this the than you are? You may have already done some data analysis before.

95
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:21,350
So any statistical issue you see.

96
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:32,660
Not exactly environmental, but I got a lot of data from patients who are showing viruses and so on and, you know, realizing that the quantity,

97
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:40,280
quantity, the amount of virus being shared by patients and I need to sort of fit the progressive infection curve.

98
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:52,010
So the drug of progress of the infection, yeah. So what was specific statistic or analytic problem or issue you need to address at the time?

99
00:11:52,550 --> 00:12:02,390
So the problem I was trying to merge sort of models of like the wastewater epidemiology with fecal shedding rates of the individuals.

100
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:09,200
And so I needed sort of a continuous curve of viral shedding in order to like merge those together.

101
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:13,880
Okay. So the merger together means that so it is the picture.

102
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:19,820
So that is not my area. So I do not understand for the terminology you use.

103
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:25,040
But so it is continuous the, the exposed data.

104
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:34,610
So you see it is highly so spread, very widely distributed and then and then association.

105
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:42,410
So so did you look at some of the association between exposed an outcome, exposure and outcome or.

106
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:47,790
It's a just a descriptive not so much. Okay. General general distribution sharing.

107
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,620
Okay. Sort of summarize that. Okay. Way that makes sense.

108
00:12:51,870 --> 00:13:04,459
There's some sort of a graph. Okay. Yeah. So this class, we also so we will mainly focus on exposing our relationship based on some, you know,

109
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:15,200
the research question about how this exposure lead to this disease but just human data, not like experimental animal data.

110
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:28,040
And then so but at the beginning we would also briefly talk about so what is the best way to describe what's happening and then visualize the data,

111
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,360
even though that's not the main focus of this class, but it is also important.

112
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:46,010
Okay. All right. So anyone wants to have another another example you want to share so specific environmental issue you you need to address or Libya.

113
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:51,800
Yeah, I learned a lot at heavy metal exposure and part of my okay childhood.

114
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:59,360
So I've had it in the past where I see that that relationship doesn't exactly look linear, but how to deal with that.

115
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,820
So I tried using generalized additive models of form are not very comfortable.

116
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:09,250
Okay so that's something I know will be useful for that situation customization or how to work.

117
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:15,750
Okay. So in that analysis, so you so you use generalized additive model attempts.

118
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:22,140
Okay. That's that's a good right. So everyone should attend this class that's an additive.

119
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:29,800
And then but after you attend that and then so what did you learn?

120
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:35,120
So did you see a difference between the approach you used before?

121
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:40,100
For example, it's as a linear model and then compared to this generalized additive model.

122
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:45,350
So what difference did you find? It seems like the effect size has changed quite a bit.

123
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:48,659
So at first what I had done was I was using linear models,

124
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:56,600
but I had categorized the exposure in second styles as I was seeing in the third quartile, others as excited as dramatically increased.

125
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,680
But I didn't see the same thing with the models. Okay. And I didn't know what to make of that.

126
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:07,630
Okay. Okay. So. This is one of the main topic of this class.

127
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:15,219
So and then later, I will talk about this potential non-linear relationship which is so critical in environ to

128
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:23,680
has data because we use continuous explicit data measure using biological center or using,

129
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:30,310
you know, stationary monitoring data every day we collect and present data, temperature data, right?

130
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:34,360
It is not low and high, even though you can say low in high.

131
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:37,540
Right. But we measure is a continuous a scale.

132
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:45,400
Right. And then we encounter very often that association is not just linear relationship that

133
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:55,810
mainly cover in done the introductory and intermediate lovers that is statistical classes.

134
00:15:55,990 --> 00:16:04,600
So we want to go beyond that approach within this class and that we will talk about many different types of exposure scenario.

135
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:10,860
So that is another important one. And you want to. Not much.

136
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:16,370
Yeah. This is an analysis that I was directly doing,

137
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:24,370
but I was doing the literature review on extreme heat exposure and premature birth and looking at different methods that

138
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:31,540
people have used in a lot of the statistical properties where around first like assigning exposure to extreme heat.

139
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:40,299
So a lot of studies took like a county level measurement of and even assign that to an individual woman's exposure.

140
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:44,980
But that's not necessarily the best model for the different models of that.

141
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:48,459
And then a lot of factors influence premature birth.

142
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:52,210
So how do you account for individual level?

143
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:57,580
And so some studies use multilevel modeling.

144
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:03,130
Okay. So this is another different levers of statistical issue, right?

145
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:15,910
And then if you like a from the photos for who to bias they're 523 so then at the end that class cover is correlated data analysis.

146
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:27,520
Right. And then actually the correlate data analysis statistically, you know, using some specific approach, we need to use that.

147
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:37,840
But the main statistical problem we will need to address is when you are looking at these correlate data that it impacts your inference,

148
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:44,090
like your significance testing by, you know, the minima.

149
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:52,480
So reducing your standard error and then that that will increase your chance to reject on your hypothesis.

150
00:17:52,570 --> 00:18:00,250
And then that's why you encounter that. But replicate estimation not only that correlated data issue but also confounding, right?

151
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:06,670
So individual level confounding and then neighborhood or leverage geographic level confounding issue.

152
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:10,750
So that is a very important epidemiologic issue.

153
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,310
So we we need to address this.

154
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:21,130
So throughout this class, we will talk a lot about this confounding and then what is the best strategy to address this confounding issue?

155
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:25,990
So that is another important topic. We will cover this.

156
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:31,780
All right. So then we have two additional student just arrive.

157
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:34,839
So we just finished our introduction.

158
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:43,499
So why don't you introduce a name, your degree program year and then at the end of this class.

159
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:48,570
So what you want to learn from this class? Hi everyone in Savannah Sterling.

160
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:59,260
I am a second year student in DHS and I am interested in learning a lot of the methods we're going to cover,

161
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:05,530
but particularly something I haven't looked into and would like to better understand some mixture methods.

162
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:12,030
Who's your advisor? Okay.

163
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:21,280
And my name is 232 year and I students from industrial hygiene.

164
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:28,830
My interest is particularly about what is your analysis.

165
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:36,770
Okay. Are you also working with a new faculty member in DHS?

166
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:43,320
Big night. Okay. All right. So it's a big clap, right?

167
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:49,650
Okay, let's get started. So over the next hopefully less than an hour.

168
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:58,799
So I want to give you an overview over the structure of this class and then at the beginning, some logistics of this class,

169
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:10,050
as it were, and then take some break and then we will have a quick self-assessment quiz and that will not be graded.

170
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:19,530
So no. Okay. But I just want to make sure that if you or so everyone has enough competency to start this class.

171
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:24,720
So we will cover a lot of different mental topics here.

172
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:30,900
But you're going to find that this each individual topic is a semester long topic, right?

173
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:37,080
But I just finished just one week, which means that I don't cover the details of each semester.

174
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:43,920
So if you are not comfortable, then maybe so you're too early to take this class.

175
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:52,700
Okay. All right. So, again, thank you for coming to this early morning on Friday.

176
00:20:53,630 --> 00:21:02,780
So we went into Friday night to tour and we have this office hours every Wednesday, 9 to 10 a.m.

177
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:06,700
But I know your schedule very busy.

178
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:14,330
So if you are not able to make this hour of this hour, then please just imagine me or of the hour.

179
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:19,640
I am in my office so you can just come by and then we can chat.

180
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:27,139
So the one that state does come to my office. Okay. So actually, this is very important.

181
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:31,710
So. So biased step by 22.

182
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:41,880
So this is the minimum lever, which means that at least you unit you had, you should have understanding in linear motor and logistic motor.

183
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:46,910
Okay. Although I also say there's a bias.

184
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:56,830
Step by 23 is recommended. So and of this clause, we will cover survival analysis and longitudinal data analysis.

185
00:21:56,850 --> 00:22:01,819
So that is not so. In the fourth.

186
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:05,420
So by 2030. So every year by 2030, the.

187
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:15,010
The. The contents. So so the so the instructor will not able to finish the contents every year.

188
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:20,299
So it that's my understanding. So how much the fy23 cover.

189
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:28,790
So did you cover longitude a data analysis. So the the the class last full time finished the legitimate data analysis.

190
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:34,140
But those who took by 23. Good. Okay. All right.

191
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:40,470
So that's why. So this class, we will call our cover.

192
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:51,240
This little cover will call data analysis for actually four weeks, but not necessarily the topic cover in 523.

193
00:22:51,510 --> 00:23:02,340
So one is multi clever analysis. So when you do a different sampling design, especially cluster sampling, which means that,

194
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:10,050
you know, you have your target population and then before you center for doing this,

195
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:20,130
you know, academic study and then you want to refine your sempre so that one way is just, you know, anyone come to my study, right?

196
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:25,230
You introduce your study and then anyone can come to my study, which is convenient sampling, right?

197
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:30,360
The downside is that you are not able to ensure that.

198
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:34,770
So the sample you are looking at represent your target population, right?

199
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:38,130
So that's the main drawback of this continuous entry.

200
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:45,180
So that's why we are doing probability sampling. So then when you do probability sampling, you know that.

201
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:49,140
So the your sempre should represent your population, right?

202
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:57,850
But when your geographic area is to to ask, then just simple random sampling is not efficient way, right?

203
00:23:57,930 --> 00:24:01,920
So that's why you are considering different level of sampling.

204
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:09,270
So one of them is cluster sampling. So. If you do not understand what I am talking about right now, it's a fight.

205
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:17,500
So we will cover that later. Okay. But when you do this type of sampling, then you have to address this statistical issue.

206
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:24,420
So that is this collected data, which means that, you know, just the subject from the same group,

207
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:30,040
same cluster, typically the geographic location more likely correlated.

208
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:36,430
They are like right compared to the person who was selected one county versus another county.

209
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,950
They could be more different. Right. Compared to the person who was selected from the same county.

210
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:45,430
So that's why if that is the case, then you have to address that issue.

211
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:49,240
Right. So that is multilevel sampling.

212
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:56,590
And then that's why when you your sample data is based on the sampling design, then you have to address that issue.

213
00:24:56,770 --> 00:25:00,380
Okay. So that is one. Sort of.

214
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,670
I would like to talk about the whole the courses schedule. Right.

215
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:15,880
So that is what we will cover here. So week, week, a summit level data analysis and then another this runs it.

216
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:24,860
So the multi level analysis is when you measure outcome from the same subset multiple time.

217
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:34,580
So then the image of my lung function today and then I measure my lung function a month later and then another month later.

218
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:41,000
So then and then I also measure Adam's lung function today and a month later.

219
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
And then two month later. So then.

220
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:49,020
We have both of us have a three observation, right?

221
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:57,469
But three observations from me more likely to be correlated right compared to the my lung function at

222
00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:05,600
visit lung versus Adams lung function episode one we because we have a different from each other,

223
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:11,299
right? So then again, the statistical issue is there's more data.

224
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,710
So then how can you address that?

225
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:23,780
So there is this longitudinal data analysis that we cover in week ten, but on other, which may not be cover in five, 23 years.

226
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:33,460
So that's why this type of different high of sampling design and especially nationwide survey, then we are using this complex sampling.

227
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:36,620
And that will be cover in week 11.

228
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:47,480
And then the finally we tour, we will talk about this kind cities analysis, which means that you we look at today's mortality.

229
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:53,690
So how many died in Western accounting and the how many die tomorrow?

230
00:26:54,800 --> 00:27:02,330
And then the day after tomorrow. And so that's why we measure the same outcome every day for many days.

231
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:08,810
Right. So then today's mortality and then tomorrow's mortality obviously correlated.

232
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:19,790
So then if you, you know, make some scatterplot of this mortality over time, that you will see this pattern, seasonal pattern.

233
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:24,140
Right. So that's why in winter, more people die.

234
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:34,790
In summer, less people die. Right. And then that change and that that, you know, secular trend consistently happened every year.

235
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:43,210
Again, the statistical issue is what. Today's mortality is highly correlated with tomorrow's mortality rate.

236
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:48,960
We have to address that issue. So that is one of the important steps.

237
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:58,150
So environment, a health issue when you look at daily air pollution data and daily with power.

238
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:01,870
Right. So we will also have a chance to talk about that issue.

239
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:09,320
Okay. But it's good to know that now 523 at least cover this long term data analysis this year.

240
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:18,409
So this is why. Even though I require only bios to 522 in this class.

241
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:26,020
But. Bio supplied 23 is recommended for those who haven't taken by step by 23.

242
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:37,380
So does the later this those topics probably a little bit harder so that that's why at the time so I tried to um,

243
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:42,580
I would try my best to deliver the core concept of this.

244
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:48,730
So what is the statistical issue in correlated data and then how to address that issue.

245
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:59,350
But so and also I will provide some additional materials, so please read those materials to better understand those topics.

246
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:04,239
Okay. And then another prerequisite obviously is epidemiology.

247
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:10,870
So, um, so the I want to make sure that you have understanding the epidemiology.

248
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:15,640
Okay. But just minimum ever. So introductory lover should be fine.

249
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:22,320
Okay. All right. And then I want to acknowledge my fourth advisor, Sir George Schwartz.

250
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:32,320
Dr. George Schwartz is a professor in environment, affairs and epidemiology in Harvard School of Public Health, who was my style divider.

251
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:38,770
And then my colleague Antonia, who initially developed this class.

252
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:44,910
And then they kindly agreed to share the material.

253
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:51,530
And then but what I am covering right now is quite different from what they provide at that time.

254
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:55,990
So I have taught this class now, I think now about ten years.

255
00:29:56,110 --> 00:30:06,730
So all the contents evolved over the past ten years and then much more exciting contents are included here.

256
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:11,290
So. So please. So that will be the main one.

257
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:18,390
And then, so if you have any questions, um, during this winter semester, so even, um,

258
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:32,830
I usually go to bed 11:04 a.m. and, and then I sometimes get an email 11 p.m. the day before the deadline of your home.

259
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:36,980
I try to answer to your question, so don't hesitate.

260
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,500
Just should you even. Okay. Um.

261
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:46,120
Class policy. So, um. As you are here, so class will be offered in person.

262
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:50,859
So. And this is so this year I was. Yeah, I was considering.

263
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:56,110
So what will be the best, right? Is it because last year I did this in as a hybrid format.

264
00:30:56,740 --> 00:31:03,220
Every week I see only one or two persons every on because Friday morning I didn't want to go.

265
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:08,830
I go to school. Right. And then so that's why most most of you just.

266
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:21,010
At home. And then even though I you know, through the zoom, I try to see you over the zoom, but no one else no one interact with me.

267
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:26,200
And then end of the class in general.

268
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:30,150
My observation is her performance was so terrible.

269
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:34,430
So that's why I don't think hybrid is a good one.

270
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,360
You have to come to class in person. Okay.

271
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:47,090
So that's why. But if you are sick or have any symptom and then are not comfortable to attend in person.

272
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:55,870
Just stay home. It's fine. There will be no synchronous zoom class, but as you see, not right now.

273
00:31:56,710 --> 00:32:03,070
I am recording all the lecture. Okay. And then the recording will be posted right after class.

274
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:09,460
Okay. So they don't even know, cannot hear but try to attend in person.

275
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:16,420
Okay. So it's it's critical. And what if you have to miss the class?

276
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:21,010
Please imagine me a day before. Or if you are sick in the morning.

277
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:24,640
It's okay. So send your email in the morning.

278
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:32,709
Wearing a mask is not mandatory, but it depends on the CDC guideline and the school policy.

279
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:36,700
So if school policy change, then I will ask you to wear a mask.

280
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:42,340
So sometime and then wearing a mask is mandatory.

281
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:45,700
And I also will mask and then speak.

282
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:51,070
Then my voice may not be so it may not be clear.

283
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:55,809
So if you do not understand what I am talking about, then please don't hesitate.

284
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:59,590
Just raise your hand and ask me. And also I will ask you.

285
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:13,120
So if I don't understand what you ask. Okay, so and then I just straight out, this should not either should limit drinking in the classroom.

286
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:18,069
And given the current, you know, the guideline, I think it's fine.

287
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:22,600
But it also depends on the CDC guidelines and the school policy change.

288
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:28,150
Okay. So the core score and I think I already share this,

289
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:35,950
but bottom line is this new and advanced data analysis to probably what you on from your previous classes

290
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:43,450
and that beyond beyond those the topic but in the context of this environment are data analysis.

291
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:59,390
And finally we will be using our no says no us data, no SPSS here only R okay, so and then you may want to add y right?

292
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:08,410
Why I cannot use sex or other other states as a software and this is because you know you will find

293
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:15,730
so the topic again this that this cartoon we will use the in this class and not available in other

294
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:23,919
other states because software okay and also after you graduate and when you do your data analysis

295
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:32,050
and you will find a R is very popular and then especially data visualization so input so useful.

296
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:37,690
So that's why I strongly encourage you to use R and a u r r library is not high.

297
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:44,080
It's fine. Okay. Over this class. You will, you will.

298
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,910
You will learn and then practice and then end of the class probably.

299
00:34:48,910 --> 00:34:52,290
You are never should go up, so. No. Okay.

300
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:59,620
But if you have never used R, then I don't think this is the right course.

301
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:06,860
So at least you have to you you should have some experience of art before and then,

302
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:12,230
but you are not very comfortable to use ah for data analysis, but it's fine.

303
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:15,890
Okay. So throughout this class you will practice that.

304
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:25,700
Okay. Of course. Come with this. I will not going over to hold this, but please take a look.

305
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:30,860
And then when I introduce the courses later and most of this topic will be cover.

306
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:35,420
And of course, the materials. So you don't need to buy a new textbook.

307
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:47,060
So those two textbooks that I recommend or I introduce here is so some of the top recovery here are from those textbook.

308
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:59,030
And then the second one. So Duncan Thomas, who is the epidemiologist and the statistician who wrote this, a statistical method involuntary review.

309
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:08,450
So if you look for a single textbook covering four topics in this environment epidemiology, then I think this is a good textbook.

310
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:15,530
Okay. So that's why I recommend these. But you do need to buy a new textbook for this class.

311
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:20,450
And then the our menu are so available in canvas.

312
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:25,820
And then strongly recommend. So later, I will also give you some.

313
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:31,790
Sure. This web based short course. So for those who have little or only a little experience.

314
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:46,150
And then starting from next week and that we will immediately star data analysis using R and then hopefully at least you should know how to read,

315
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:54,560
assess data or how to read C s v or text data set in R and R opened up fire.

316
00:36:54,830 --> 00:37:05,389
So if you do not know even how to how to start r and the how to open SAS fire in R and then make ready for data analysis,

317
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:08,480
then please go to this website.

318
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:19,790
So introduction to R for epidemiologists. And then this web page will give you some input on basic introduction to R.

319
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:29,720
All right. So the course is schedule again. So today we will go over this and then starting from next week.

320
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:40,250
So the linear regression, logistic regression, so this class will cover all these different types of statistical statistics matter.

321
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:45,820
And then I used them only for Hallmark's.

322
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:55,860
And then just today morning and from yesterday, I was thinking that what would be the best way to help you?

323
00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:03,400
Do better in homo. And then I decide to split homo two into two.

324
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:12,260
So that's why now home of two and three. So the actual whole amount of a war will be the same.

325
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:17,770
But when I put home up to deadline is until week six.

326
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:21,460
Nobody's doing any data analysis until week six.

327
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:33,030
And then just. A few days before that to deadline and then you just e-mailed me and not even I do not know how to even open this data.

328
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:39,540
And so I think that's too late. If you don't do any of that, if you do not have any form of deadline.

329
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:46,530
So that's why I put this homework to deadline week four, which is just part of the previous homework.

330
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:54,270
So just I split this home up two into two and the rest of the homework two now into homework three.

331
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:58,590
So that's why I do it all. So the total amount will be the same.

332
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:03,270
So I didn't put too much burden to this class. But just to help you.

333
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:08,579
So I just split this homework into two. So that's why I will.

334
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:13,500
After today's class, I will give you home a one, which is just paper reading.

335
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:21,300
So this is the paper for your homework. So before you start your data analysis, you have to understand what is the context for this data analysis,

336
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:25,110
which is our senior year and type two diabetes.

337
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:30,810
Okay. And then the the, you know, blood glucose level.

338
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:36,410
So outcome continuous outcome glucose and then binary outcome.

339
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:43,480
Type two diabetes. And so to better understand so you will need to understand this context.

340
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:46,620
So that's why the homework one paper is a paper critique.

341
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:56,080
And then so this class, we're talking a lot about, this care law transformation,

342
00:39:56,080 --> 00:40:01,360
why we have to lawyer transform outcome, why we have to transform exploiter.

343
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:05,740
And then when we allover transform each of these variable,

344
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:13,180
how to interpret and then what to present, and then to present that measure, how to calculate.

345
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:26,110
So this is all about, you know, the, the, the data management and the data analysis and then, you know, best practice in epidemiologic research.

346
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:31,830
Okay. And then starting from week six.

347
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:37,570
And as you can see. So that's the first time to talk about this scatterplot.

348
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:43,990
So how many have use smoothing or nonlinear relationship before?

349
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:51,170
Yeah. Okay. All right. So it's okay.

350
00:40:51,190 --> 00:41:07,090
So if you have no expense before. But anyone has got to have a formal, formal lecture about this squared plus smoothing or nonlinear relationship.

351
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:11,680
No. Just use the function in our or SAS.

352
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:15,230
Okay. All right. So that's what I will give you.

353
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:25,090
Again, so this is also a semester long class, but I will give you two weeks about this smoothing and then generalize over two models.

354
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,880
So that is until week seven.

355
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:40,870
And then I already mentioned starting from week a three week tour is going to correlate data analysis and they're split into multilevel analysis,

356
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:45,340
longitudinal data analysis, complex sampling design and the TIME series analysis.

357
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:52,940
And then week 13, we cover briefly survival analysis.

358
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:57,620
And then the final week we will have our guest speaker, Dr. Shin Hwang,

359
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:04,040
who will talk about his statistical political environment or chemical mixtures and.

360
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:08,800
And then with 15. No class.

361
00:42:09,010 --> 00:42:12,910
But there will be a final paper deal. Okay.

362
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:19,460
Course gravy. So that's why six Hormel quarter will be 70 point.

363
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:24,050
And then from Hormel, one through five 10%.

364
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:31,990
And the home of states, 20%. And then you can discuss with your peer when you do your homework.

365
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:37,560
But you have to work independently. Okay. Do not copy.

366
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:48,320
I see a lot. Your work together, you share the code, and then even the interpretation is the same.

367
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:53,690
Just copy that. You know, this question pays.

368
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:57,620
You will get zero point. Okay, both of them.

369
00:42:57,890 --> 00:43:01,940
Okay. Even so. That's why it's okay.

370
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:12,050
You can discuss, but you have to write your code independently and then you have to complete your homework independently.

371
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:18,560
Otherwise you will learn nothing. Okay, so that's the end of the class.

372
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:25,190
I often say that we always spend a lot of time, but not even do any data analysis.

373
00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:30,680
That's not good. Okay, so that's why you have to spend your time to complete this homework.

374
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,620
Okay. You must provide your ARCore.

375
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:48,590
And so that's why later when I introduced whom up to and I, I will talk more about how to repair and then turn in your final report.

376
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:53,860
And then even I am I am old school person. So that's why I'm not using my column.

377
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:59,210
But I found that is our market onus is very used per tour.

378
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:06,200
So for those who are familiar with our market on you, complete your homework using our market.

379
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:12,530
Okay, I strongly encourage you to use that for those who have no experience of using our market down.

380
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:17,480
Later I will show you the website and it's a very straightforward.

381
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:25,640
It's no big deal. Okay, so try it's okay not to use our market when you do your homework, it's fine.

382
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:28,670
But try to use it for your homework.

383
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:33,860
Two, three, four, five, six. Then probably you will be on expert.

384
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:39,940
Okay. Try. Less omission obviously reduced point.

385
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:50,530
But if you if you are not able to complete your homework by the deadline, please email me before earlier and then I can accommodate.

386
00:44:50,710 --> 00:44:53,470
Okay. But because I only display.

387
00:44:54,560 --> 00:45:03,560
So the reason why I split the home of two and three into two pieces is that because each home is a lot of work, require a lot of work.

388
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:08,810
And then when those home was split probably it's it's a more manageable.

389
00:45:08,930 --> 00:45:12,260
So try to meet the deadline.

390
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:17,309
Final Project 3.0, which will be the group process.

391
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:25,270
So you will work together. But you all, all of you within the group should contribute.

392
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:27,960
And then each of you give our proper.

393
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:37,940
And we will talk more about the final product later when I provide you introduce this final question and your question of, of course, grading.

394
00:45:39,430 --> 00:45:46,390
Nixon. Okay. Okay.

395
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:50,330
So let's take a short break and then start as well.

396
00:45:50,540 --> 00:46:24,910
Okay. This is an interesting tunnel.

397
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:30,690
Yes, I think so.

398
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:37,870
I think I was doing my homework. You can see my dreams were so because of yesterday.

399
00:46:38,470 --> 00:46:43,450
It was Thursday. And I was driving me, my love.

400
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:54,850
I feel insecure about my family. I regret it so much that it came back.

401
00:46:56,650 --> 00:47:06,040
Then my husband hasn't been paying how sick I was, so that's what I should come.

402
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:10,390
And my husband got it from the kids, so it was going to happen again.

403
00:47:11,350 --> 00:47:16,870
He ignored Robert. I had to drop everything. I figured I found the bottom of it.

404
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:24,110
So thank you so much. I'm sorry. I remember yesterday you and I got to talk to you.

405
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:26,230
I was coming through the dinner, I can tell you.

406
00:47:26,230 --> 00:47:38,220
And that I know it was as though the task of yesterday is very fine, Malik, but thank you so much and thank you for understanding.

407
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:58,430
Okay. You know what, Peter?

408
00:47:58,630 --> 00:48:08,730
So I'm so in love with you next year.

409
00:48:10,590 --> 00:48:15,969
Then. So you haven't taken any infographic, anything in the intro?

410
00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:33,520
I took off and then took each and it's the one compartment was when the requisite in the class about personal levels and disclosure.

411
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:39,520
We mentioned that environmental engineering and molecular biology.

412
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:51,249
Okay. And then this is because of the special homework and then you can find a protein.

413
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:56,680
And then I am asking that is actually the this morning, Dana.

414
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:59,900
Now this is probably not very good.

415
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:06,300
Yeah. Yeah. The oxygen that I am asking is more I keep.

416
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:15,460
I'm sure that's why I see you a company the way that is too.

417
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:24,940
Yeah. Yeah. So. And then you think so you have the acronym KC and then there's this course.

418
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:28,900
Or you want, you want to take it for your interpretation.

419
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:37,209
Yeah. Yeah. So, you know, my friend across is sort of statistical barriers and stuff.

420
00:49:37,210 --> 00:49:48,940
And so I he's been talking about some parametric models for what I do and I'm starting a project running.

421
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:58,750
So I thought, okay, that's my help. So yeah, I found this is data analysis.

422
00:49:58,750 --> 00:50:11,480
And so I do feel more and more I'm doing the right thing by oh, Jesus, no, no, no.

423
00:50:11,870 --> 00:50:18,350
You know what the problem is, you know?

424
00:50:18,430 --> 00:50:21,430
So, yeah.

425
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:31,530
So that means that you have to be able to do more work around 3:00.

426
00:50:31,870 --> 00:50:43,810
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So would that be Aaron on the first one where I hope that, you know, forewarned will be okay.

427
00:50:45,530 --> 00:51:00,400
So yeah, I am asking overall this very bizarre, oh, you follow me and then it's kind of like expert assessment, health recession.

428
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:05,150
Yeah, all of us was one. So you are here.

429
00:51:05,530 --> 00:51:14,170
Yeah. So even though it's you, you have to get that information from the people and figure out a little bit.

430
00:51:14,410 --> 00:51:19,380
And then I'm just like, this is really dishonest, okay?

431
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:33,820
And I think so I really feel a little bit like how you can make that not then.

432
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:58,430
Yeah, okay. I think somebody that knows how many people that are in their environment.

433
00:52:02,450 --> 00:52:17,430
But in this rhythm.

434
00:52:18,590 --> 00:52:30,320
So no one is here. No one's to three or two, three or four years to make a plan.

435
00:52:30,530 --> 00:52:44,480
Right now, we're making their intentions clear.

436
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:57,650
That's what we need to do.

437
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:05,290
Yeah. Okay.

438
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:11,040
Let's begin. So.

439
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:22,350
So everyone should know this first or maybe before we start, because I'm just doing a later.

440
00:53:22,370 --> 00:53:34,280
So anyway, so everyone already introduced themselves your name, your degree program here and what you're looking for from this class.

441
00:53:35,550 --> 00:53:39,260
Hi. That's nice. Yeah, yeah.

442
00:53:39,260 --> 00:53:43,430
Hi. My name is. I know. And occupation medical epidemiologist.

443
00:53:44,090 --> 00:53:53,270
I have two kids so I think I would listen to plus. But what I'm looking forward to like we always had a choice between us and our studio.

444
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:58,520
So whenever I found fast difficult, I used to switch to our studio.

445
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:04,459
So this time it's our art. So I'm just hoping I would have less problem with it.

446
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:08,720
It's more straightforward and I was hoping it would be easier.

447
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:14,060
And I get to voice stuff and I'm a bit slow when it comes to things, so I think I'd be giving more time to it.

448
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:18,860
No problem. Okay. All right.

449
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:25,100
Okay. Who. Who is this person? Everyone knows.

450
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:29,700
Maybe. Don't say so. I do not know this person.

451
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:33,870
That's okay. So I do not know. I see this person first time.

452
00:54:35,070 --> 00:54:38,330
Every not. Okay. Who? This.

453
00:54:38,450 --> 00:54:42,850
Who is here? Name.

454
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:49,180
Jon Snow. Right. Okay. What? But he did.

455
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:59,910
It's known as what in epidemiology? Father.

456
00:55:02,610 --> 00:55:06,930
Father of epidemiology. Why? Why?

457
00:55:08,450 --> 00:55:13,400
Broad Street. Yeah. And then broken the, you know, the lever of this sort.

458
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:21,290
Water source. Right. Okay. And then here broke this, you know, broth, free pond.

459
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:25,610
And then this is because at that time, Clara in London.

460
00:55:25,610 --> 00:55:28,459
So this is a big problem at that time.

461
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:38,360
And then in so you may know or so this story, but just briefly, at the time there were two water supply companies in London.

462
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:44,090
One is Southwark, Vauxhall, one company, and another one is Lambeth Water Company.

463
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:51,080
And then so after, you know, do some survey and then, you know, collected this information.

464
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:56,300
So who died and then who didn't die? And then what was their water source?

465
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:59,899
And they using information and then a pipe immunity.

466
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:03,350
One or one we can create is two by two table.

467
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:07,790
Right. And they're using this two by two table. What we can calculate.

468
00:56:10,250 --> 00:56:13,890
We calculate. What?

469
00:56:15,850 --> 00:56:19,910
The risk. And ratio.

470
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:23,910
Right. Okay. So that's why in this case death.

471
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:36,270
And then, you know, the the overall who was supplied so water from the south or Vauxhall water company and then using

472
00:56:36,270 --> 00:56:41,970
that information how many die and that we can calculate what was the you know this vast array.

473
00:56:43,350 --> 00:56:50,639
And then the water company 37 per 10,000 and they're using this information we can calculate

474
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:56,580
is in this case this this is a risk ratio because we didn't consider any time component.

475
00:56:56,790 --> 00:57:01,490
So that's why risk ratio is 8.3. What does this mean?

476
00:57:01,530 --> 00:57:12,160
8.3. How can we interpret this? Yeah.

477
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:18,280
Yeah. Three times more likely to die in some weird foxhole.

478
00:57:19,870 --> 00:57:23,590
Okay, so hold on. So I see that no audio, right?

479
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:30,960
This. Audio sources very high on asylum.

480
00:57:37,650 --> 00:57:47,340
So I'm not sure. So if I can handle anything so that they know we have crews to the mess and and the today is just over.

481
00:57:47,350 --> 00:57:52,740
So after this class, we're going to figure this out.

482
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:57,600
Let me just keep going. Okay.

483
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:06,480
So sailing the situation there. So if you if your water source was Southwark and Vauxhall Water Company,

484
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:20,010
then you you have your mortality rate is about 8.3 times higher compared to the person whose water source was Lambeth Water Company.

485
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:26,640
Right. So that's why depending on your water source and the you have different your mortality risk.

486
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:32,450
So why this? A study we used is to buy to taper.

487
00:58:32,450 --> 00:58:40,340
Right. So that so when you take ap1 or one or in in our schools scores 600 or public a supply for

488
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:46,700
then at the beginning with we these this collect the information create this to make a paper.

489
00:58:47,330 --> 00:58:50,900
So this type of analysis worked very fine for Clara.

490
00:58:51,410 --> 00:58:55,310
And in this case, because Clara is the only cause.

491
00:58:57,370 --> 00:59:00,520
And they maintained that stage of death fell down.

492
00:59:00,970 --> 00:59:04,610
And then actually, I have to, you know, update this plot.

493
00:59:04,630 --> 00:59:08,020
Right. So a 2020.

494
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:14,660
And obviously, you know, this is the main source or main cause of the disease.

495
00:59:14,670 --> 00:59:21,510
Right. So that's why this COVID but not only COVID, but also, you know, this you know,

496
00:59:21,510 --> 00:59:28,860
the coronavirus and other infectious agent majors cause of disease these days.

497
00:59:29,070 --> 00:59:36,600
But anyway, so over the past several, many years, especially between 1951 and the 2000,

498
00:59:36,750 --> 00:59:42,390
so this time, so infectious disease were not a major cause of the disease or death.

499
00:59:43,850 --> 00:59:46,910
And and during this time. So cardiovascular deaths.

500
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:58,630
Rise. And then one of the main course studied to address this cardiovascular disease issue was its Framingham Heart Study, which started in 1948.

501
00:59:59,020 --> 01:00:04,600
And then right now, this Framingham Heart Study is a third generation study.

502
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:11,110
And to date, try to find out what a major risk factor for cardiovascular mortality,

503
01:00:11,110 --> 01:00:15,220
including blood pressure, cholesterol, triglyceride, lung function.

504
01:00:15,610 --> 01:00:24,730
And all this study of this Framingham Heart study was also based on something like two bikes, a table and then they use.

505
01:00:25,420 --> 01:00:33,940
So whether or not is blood pressure is a risk factor for cardiovascular mortality to address that research caution.

506
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:42,760
And then they met, they measure blood pressure and then compare high blood pressure versus low blood pressure.

507
01:00:43,590 --> 01:00:47,160
So then we need a definition. What is the high?

508
01:00:48,050 --> 01:00:53,090
How can you define high blood pressure? So over the past several year.

509
01:00:54,220 --> 01:01:01,780
Blood pressure and high blood pressure. Well, hypertension is based on blood pressure, so systolic and diastolic.

510
01:01:02,350 --> 01:01:06,400
And then the definition of this high change over time.

511
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:10,840
So that's why. Well, those who are no more.

512
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:22,030
In 1997. Become high blood pressure if we are using this new definition.

513
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:28,380
Right. Even though their blood pressure is the same. Does this make sense?

514
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:34,200
Yeah. Because now we changed the definition.

515
01:01:34,590 --> 01:01:38,399
Because of that we have more information and the scientific evidence.

516
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:44,610
So that's all, you know, just greater than one point in that between a 1 to 1 study.

517
01:01:45,180 --> 01:01:48,740
We can say that this is a stage one high blood pressure, right?

518
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:54,300
Well, we didn't know that in 1997. So that's how we change this definition.

519
01:01:54,810 --> 01:02:04,320
But there's a better way, rather than using just cut nine, so 120 or 130 and then define high versus low.

520
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:11,469
So that's why it is high BP and and not high BP.

521
01:02:11,470 --> 01:02:17,890
And in making this two by two paper may not be our best approach to analyze this type of data.

522
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:27,510
Right. So relative risk depends on the definition of high blood pressure on other evidence for smoking and lung cancer.

523
01:02:27,530 --> 01:02:31,340
So then. So how can we collect smoking information?

524
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:37,100
We are making a questionnaire. And then we ask, Do you smoke?

525
01:02:38,540 --> 01:02:42,560
And then based on the question, say yes or no.

526
01:02:43,310 --> 01:02:50,300
And then then you can test. So this person is non smoker at this point, right?

527
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:55,040
This is a smoker at this point. So then the next follow on, should that be?

528
01:02:56,060 --> 01:03:02,900
Did you quit smoke and that based on that person you can you can identify whether this person.

529
01:03:03,350 --> 01:03:08,960
So for those who say no. When I went with ask, do you smoke?

530
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:18,140
And then we can see that. So whether this person used to smoke and then quit or never smoked.

531
01:03:18,380 --> 01:03:24,230
Right. And then using those two question, we can generate the real ever smoking status.

532
01:03:24,410 --> 01:03:27,410
So never former and current.

533
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:32,720
So that's typical way to collect a smoking status information.

534
01:03:33,590 --> 01:03:38,510
But there are other ways. One is how many cigarets is more.

535
01:03:39,350 --> 01:03:49,580
We can we can collect more information in terms of the number of cigaret smoke and then using that information and how many years have you smoke.

536
01:03:50,180 --> 01:03:55,490
And then we can create these pack years, so then we can generate this continuous scare.

537
01:03:57,240 --> 01:04:03,320
Another way is involvement of tobacco smoke or we so we used to say passive a smoke.

538
01:04:03,430 --> 01:04:12,440
Right. So even though you are not, you do not smoke your you know, anyone, you live together or your colleague.

539
01:04:12,830 --> 01:04:18,140
So that's why you exposed to smoke feeling because of you know other people smoke.

540
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:22,610
So in enhanced re or continuous and as it were.

541
01:04:22,620 --> 01:04:34,470
So we see that those who say, Nah, I never smoked, we see they're cutting your liver, which is the metabolite of the cigaret smoking nicotine.

542
01:04:35,220 --> 01:04:38,320
We see this detectable level of catenin.

543
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:44,160
So that's why this continuing is a good measure. Capturing this involves tobacco smoke.

544
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:50,430
And then this ETF has been associated with lung cancer, liver function and various symptoms.

545
01:04:51,830 --> 01:04:55,370
So that's why this is a one living example and they're creating this plot.

546
01:04:55,940 --> 01:04:59,680
So then you can see that the x axis is continuing.

547
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:03,110
And then later we will talk about this scare.

548
01:05:03,710 --> 01:05:10,220
But just simply say this is a cocaine lover and then this is a Corvette or just a rather broader set of poly.

549
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:19,700
So for ladies, the one is the marker to capture your so how much you you eat fully and then

550
01:05:20,220 --> 01:05:25,670
full length through the one carbon metabolism is converted to homocysteine,

551
01:05:26,150 --> 01:05:31,040
which is a matter of your cardiovascular function and many other thing.

552
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:37,600
So that's why the your rather blood vessel for weight is indicator of, you know,

553
01:05:37,670 --> 01:05:41,570
when you have any environmental insert and that is all a lever go down.

554
01:05:41,930 --> 01:05:46,509
Okay. So that's why, as you can see, even though this is a local scale.

555
01:05:46,510 --> 01:05:50,950
So that's why it's not easy to understand. But let's say this is a low, low level.

556
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:54,890
Right. This is a medium level. And that this is a high level.

557
01:05:55,780 --> 01:05:59,100
And then based on this range, we can see this fully.

558
01:06:01,380 --> 01:06:06,990
Gradually decline, but at some point it doesn't decline anymore.

559
01:06:06,990 --> 01:06:09,990
So there is a some Floyd effect.

560
01:06:15,530 --> 01:06:21,710
So clear to the response relationship until a certain point.

561
01:06:22,550 --> 01:06:29,629
And then we see the whole it doesn't change in months. And then using this information, we can calculate,

562
01:06:29,630 --> 01:06:42,180
we can define the low EPS exposure around this point and then intimidate its exposure and then hikes its exposure.

563
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:46,490
So that's why this area is never smoker.

564
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:55,710
Without its exposure. Right.

565
01:06:57,020 --> 01:07:00,410
This area. Probably never a smoker.

566
01:07:01,340 --> 01:07:09,360
Never worked non smoker. But with its.

567
01:07:10,390 --> 01:07:14,530
Right. And then this area is an active smoker.

568
01:07:20,140 --> 01:07:28,600
So using this information, we can identify, you know, how much you could be exposed to this environment or come up with some more.

569
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:35,930
Even though you say never. So that's why we are using the street level smoking status.

570
01:07:36,290 --> 01:07:42,380
This group, the same group. Right. But actually, their exposure is different.

571
01:07:43,790 --> 01:07:54,110
So if we do not measure this X or smoking continuous scale, we cannot capture we cannot get this information.

572
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:01,690
So traditional epidemiology is just the exposure and disease.

573
01:08:01,690 --> 01:08:05,440
And then we do not know much about what's happening in the in the middle.

574
01:08:05,530 --> 01:08:16,610
Right. So that's why is a total black box. But more recent molecular IP tour allow us to evaluate intermediate phenomenon.

575
01:08:16,930 --> 01:08:24,580
So that's why we can say that this is the exposure, but not only exposure, let's say external lab exposure.

576
01:08:25,060 --> 01:08:33,879
And then we are measuring provider level which is include outdoors and then biological effect dose and the only biological effect.

577
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:39,190
And then finally functional change or clinical disease and prognostic significance.

578
01:08:39,780 --> 01:08:43,510
And but not only this, but also we can also measure or before then.

579
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:49,870
So those are internally those and biological effective those we call these those are the markers of exposure.

580
01:08:50,710 --> 01:08:56,440
And then also the structure structure and the function clinical disease record.

581
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:58,180
Those are the markers of a disease.

582
01:08:58,750 --> 01:09:07,540
And then we can also measure in between what's happening in terms of the susceptibility, and then we call those markers of susceptibility.

583
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:17,930
And more complex diagram in terms of this modern environmental and molecular epidemiology.

584
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:27,470
So we measure exposure and outcome. But what's happening in between using various these biomarkers, molecular biomarkers,

585
01:09:27,620 --> 01:09:32,570
which help us better understand in terms of disease mechanism and so on.

586
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:38,750
So that's why this is a, the current trends how environmental study is done.

587
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:47,190
So molecular epidemiologic, we measure of those biomarkers so only by exposure,

588
01:09:47,190 --> 01:09:53,130
biomarker or intermediate level to, you know, what's happening in the body.

589
01:09:53,640 --> 01:10:00,180
And also those biomarkers have better understand and diagnose clinical disease as were.

590
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:11,899
So improving exposure assessment. And then we capture this all exchange and then identify a subgroup based on the susceptibility biomarker.

591
01:10:11,900 --> 01:10:17,570
So genetic information and biotin metabolomics and epigenetics,

592
01:10:17,570 --> 01:10:27,410
many other things are those are the susceptibility factors and then allow us to identify this causes then elucidate the mechanism.

593
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:39,960
So exposure is continuous. So the and technology have improved and that's why we want to measure this that the same way.

594
01:10:40,140 --> 01:10:43,080
So a cigaret rather than a real ever smoking status.

595
01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:52,120
We want to measure peg years or we are measuring using biomarker or serum catena level the chemical and biological sample.

596
01:10:52,140 --> 01:10:55,530
So instead of using questionnaire, what have you been exposed to?

597
01:10:55,560 --> 01:11:00,090
Lag. We measure, we collect blood and then measure the level.

598
01:11:01,290 --> 01:11:09,930
Or we are measuring ambient air pollution, and then this information can inform the process of establishing regulatory standards.

599
01:11:10,260 --> 01:11:12,760
So even though this is not a risk assessment class,

600
01:11:12,790 --> 01:11:24,660
but we will have a chance to talk about how data analysis in in bottle two has had and inform policy and how this policy standards are determined.

601
01:11:25,350 --> 01:11:35,760
So we need to model this way rather than after you collect this information continuous and then lump and then categorize.

602
01:11:38,250 --> 01:11:42,569
So categorizing continuous variable here sometimes we call this is the ordinary

603
01:11:42,570 --> 01:11:48,390
part of what we promote polarization and that this is sometimes used for.

604
01:11:49,310 --> 01:11:51,980
And that this is very common in clinical research.

605
01:11:52,010 --> 01:11:58,970
So if you look at the clinical paper, then you will see that even though their management is based on continuous,

606
01:11:59,300 --> 01:12:07,970
they categorize and then reported that way and that this is because statistical standpoint it can avoid certain assumption.

607
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:13,250
So when you are using continuous scare, so then you require some assumption,

608
01:12:13,730 --> 01:12:21,530
but when you category that assumption is gone and there are simpler and then sometime descriptive analysis,

609
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:27,890
this approach is fine and then probably so many for the test.

610
01:12:28,220 --> 01:12:32,570
One of the one of them is this mental test for Tran.

611
01:12:33,230 --> 01:12:40,430
Tran the test. But the main problem is once you lump and then categorized, you lose that information.

612
01:12:41,030 --> 01:12:45,500
And another important one is Mazda monitor. So there's a lot of pressure.

613
01:12:45,510 --> 01:12:50,470
We just mentioned that, right? 130. When you are using that, right.

614
01:12:50,920 --> 01:13:00,100
And then let's say ten years later. So at 140 and then ten year later, that threshold down to 130.

615
01:13:00,340 --> 01:13:06,969
So the in between. So their classification high now changed to the low.

616
01:13:06,970 --> 01:13:12,960
Changed to high. Right. So that's why that is measurement error misclassification.

617
01:13:13,420 --> 01:13:20,380
That misclassification can happen when you compare a continuous variable after you lose that information.

618
01:13:21,580 --> 01:13:24,580
Another important issues loss of power.

619
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:29,920
So the can anyone can explain.

620
01:13:32,330 --> 01:13:38,910
You categorized continuous variable. And the why that approach you lose power.

621
01:13:40,020 --> 01:13:50,970
What this mean. So from your previous class bias or epidemiology, probably you have heard about, oh, I have to categorize, I lose power.

622
01:13:51,500 --> 01:14:01,160
Why? What does this mean? One hint is degree of freedom.

623
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:08,860
It takes up more degrees of freedom to have more variables.

624
01:14:08,870 --> 01:14:13,120
And you create like so many variables that will take it more than having woman.

625
01:14:13,350 --> 01:14:20,200
Then what? How many degrees of freedom required when you treat that variable as continuous in one?

626
01:14:20,290 --> 01:14:26,459
What? If you could terrorize into car tire, then how many?

627
01:14:26,460 --> 01:14:36,350
If you grow freedom, you. You need. Four or so the full groups but statistical ways is how many dummy variable union.

628
01:14:38,310 --> 01:14:42,210
Three. Right. So that's why you need three degrees of freedom.

629
01:14:43,470 --> 01:14:46,500
Power is a functional degree of freedom.

630
01:14:47,150 --> 01:14:51,090
Okay. So that's why when you convert that way.

631
01:14:52,250 --> 01:14:57,200
You are using more freedom for for your mother building.

632
01:14:58,770 --> 01:15:07,410
And then after you model so beautiful Mordor and the rest of the degrees of freedom will be used for your significance testing.

633
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:12,160
So power is significance testing, right?

634
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:24,670
High power means that you will be able to more confidently cast your singing singing cuts, and then you will be able to reject the null hypothesis.

635
01:15:24,850 --> 01:15:28,340
Right. Given the same sample size. Right.

636
01:15:29,990 --> 01:15:39,920
So that's why I you know so this class so I assume that your learn about sympathize power degrees of freedom and the significance testing altogether.

637
01:15:41,550 --> 01:15:45,780
So that's why when you convert that way, you lose this.

638
01:15:46,380 --> 01:15:53,310
You are increasing your freedom, which is related to your significance testing, right?

639
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:57,610
And that's why you are losing the power. Okay.

640
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:06,870
And then the, you know, model building statistical reports for when you and when you cut paper are your variable.

641
01:16:06,910 --> 01:16:11,050
The only way is model this variable we're using dummy, right?

642
01:16:11,650 --> 01:16:18,190
But if it is continuous, there's many different way to fit your data your vary over.

643
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:31,490
Okay. So one example is, let's say this is age and systolic blood pressure relationship and then just scatterplot and as you expand,

644
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,309
so age and systolic blood pressure.

645
01:16:34,310 --> 01:16:44,360
So when pressure just over, so if you do a dichotomous variable, would that still be a loss of power or would that not?

646
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:52,040
So the dichotomy is and then so in terms of degree of freedom, obviously it requires just to one very variable, right?

647
01:16:52,130 --> 01:16:58,010
So that's why the the the the degree of freedom standpoint is the same.

648
01:16:58,580 --> 01:17:03,800
But the problem is so the if the association is not like this step.

649
01:17:05,390 --> 01:17:14,270
Association. So tell me about your means that you are assuming that association is one group is here another good to

650
01:17:14,270 --> 01:17:22,370
be here so they risk is this point right so that's why that in terms of the relationship in the if total

651
01:17:22,370 --> 01:17:31,940
response relationship is not so this or even you know different way then this supports cannot capture this

652
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:38,960
right and also you are averaging is even though this is a real linear relationship you are averaging.

653
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:46,100
This group is just mean is here and then this gruesome to is here rather than you are capturing this way.

654
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:54,170
So that's why the degree of freedom is the same but you are not able to capture as good as when you treat this as a continuous variable.

655
01:17:54,830 --> 01:17:59,570
So that's why even though I say yeah, so this is a function of degree of freedom,

656
01:17:59,990 --> 01:18:05,930
but yeah, so the power is not just a degree of freedom only function.

657
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:13,220
There are many other factor or impact of power. Okay.

658
01:18:13,790 --> 01:18:24,739
So again, so when you look at this age and systolic blood pressure and then making scatterplot and then in general,

659
01:18:24,740 --> 01:18:31,340
we know that systolic blood pressure increase with age and then this is clearly show this trend.

660
01:18:32,690 --> 01:18:36,560
The let's say you decide to categorize this into three age group.

661
01:18:37,550 --> 01:18:43,140
And then making it all right. So then over time, probably it's okay.

662
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:46,430
So that's a descriptive purpose. This is fine.

663
01:18:46,610 --> 01:18:51,130
Right. But compared to this. This plot versus previous plot.

664
01:18:51,140 --> 01:18:54,470
So what did you see? What's the difference?

665
01:18:57,500 --> 01:19:03,700
So do you like this plan versus the previous plan? So a simple way.

666
01:19:03,790 --> 01:19:08,349
Simply describe the relationship between age and systolic blood pressure.

667
01:19:08,350 --> 01:19:11,500
Probably this is good enough, right?

668
01:19:11,710 --> 01:19:18,250
You want to say that systolic blood pressure increases with age and that clearly this plot also showed that way?

669
01:19:18,370 --> 01:19:23,260
Right. The main problem is that when you compare the rise.

670
01:19:24,540 --> 01:19:28,680
Probably this is aged between 20 and then 40.

671
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:37,130
This is a 40 to 60 that's happening and that this is over a six year.

672
01:19:38,460 --> 01:19:44,610
Right. So then you do not know what's happening within this age of 20 and 40.

673
01:19:45,030 --> 01:19:48,060
And then 40 and 60 and 60 and over.

674
01:19:49,220 --> 01:19:59,240
And that this is clearly see that I know it's not easy to capture, but do you see that this systolic blood pressure and age is a clear.

675
01:20:00,410 --> 01:20:06,230
Monotonic linear relationship. Not one name.

676
01:20:08,980 --> 01:20:12,550
Do you see systolic blood pressure monotonically?

677
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:16,730
Increase.

678
01:20:18,700 --> 01:20:28,180
Which means that if you measure your blood pressure at your age at 20 and then when you become aged 32, you expect your blood pressure change much.

679
01:20:30,170 --> 01:20:35,420
Individual lever could the chain. But at the population level we do not see much.

680
01:20:35,870 --> 01:20:39,690
Which means that, as you can see here. A lot of pressure.

681
01:20:39,780 --> 01:20:47,760
FLYNN If you close look this right there, even the overall trend is a linear.

682
01:20:48,950 --> 01:21:02,440
Monotony. But after ten years, the global pressure doesn't change much.

683
01:21:03,070 --> 01:21:06,580
What's a slow trend in only eight?

684
01:21:07,690 --> 01:21:11,060
And then when? We are below.

685
01:21:11,190 --> 01:21:17,220
So increase in blood pressure happen. That happens around age 40 and then.

686
01:21:18,350 --> 01:21:25,440
60. And do you see what's happening at age 70 over.

687
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:35,740
Do you think that trend is going up? Slow down and even slowing down.

688
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:43,450
I know it's not easy. Maybe I have a very good eye to capture this trend.

689
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:50,470
Right. But the true trend of systolic blood pressure over age is not linear trend.

690
01:21:51,190 --> 01:21:54,520
Okay. You are not able to capture this.

691
01:21:56,950 --> 01:22:03,820
If you categorize, which means that this is this means that you lose lose the information.

692
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:04,300
Right.

693
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:25,669
So this is why categorization, the summary train single sentence may be okay, you know, increase in trend which is true, but age it depends on trend.

694
01:22:25,670 --> 01:22:30,979
And then over nonlinear relationship, you may not be able to capture that if you're content.

695
01:22:30,980 --> 01:22:37,970
Right? Right. Another way is box plot and then this is good, right?

696
01:22:38,300 --> 01:22:42,890
And then we can see the clear, you know, those depend on pattern.

697
01:22:43,310 --> 01:22:48,620
And then another good one is that this can give us.

698
01:22:50,910 --> 01:22:54,030
What this going? Tell you.

699
01:22:54,980 --> 01:22:59,490
What is this? This point.

700
01:23:01,010 --> 01:23:07,350
Is it mean or medium to. As a mean or median.

701
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:13,340
Even medium. What is this?

702
01:23:16,180 --> 01:23:21,630
So. So this is a media.

703
01:23:22,110 --> 01:23:28,950
This is 75th. This is 25th. Right. And then range of days.

704
01:23:28,990 --> 01:23:33,220
Right. Do you know what this point is?

705
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:46,270
It's not very important. The one point times above is correct.

706
01:23:46,310 --> 01:23:50,350
You are right, you are right. And then bottom.

707
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:54,100
And then beyond. Those points are outliers.

708
01:23:54,220 --> 01:23:55,930
Right. Okay. All right.

709
01:23:56,770 --> 01:24:06,010
So that's why overall, this will give us some additional information which is better than just three categories and then making a scatterplot.

710
01:24:06,130 --> 01:24:10,730
Right. But still, this plot doesn't give you. Fruit fair.

711
01:24:11,390 --> 01:24:16,630
What's happening there? When you look at when you do just the scatterplot.

712
01:24:16,640 --> 01:24:23,210
Right. So that's why, depending on your research of gore, you can choose different way.

713
01:24:23,990 --> 01:24:29,990
Right. So that's why I'm not. I'm not saying that you should not do it this way.

714
01:24:30,710 --> 01:24:33,890
If your goal is just what is the overall trend?

715
01:24:34,640 --> 01:24:37,010
How about it? This is okay. Simple, right?

716
01:24:38,060 --> 01:24:49,650
And then even if you want to share more information, then between those categorizing and scatterplot versus box plot, how would it possible?

717
01:24:49,650 --> 01:24:58,670
It is better. But if you really want to capture whole the variation of the systolic blood pressure by different age range,

718
01:24:59,060 --> 01:25:09,530
then why we have to take away just fit this data as in using continuous age and then continuous systolic blood pressure, right?

719
01:25:09,860 --> 01:25:14,300
So that's why depending on your different research score, you can choose different way.

720
01:25:15,050 --> 01:25:23,670
The point is. This is what you learned from previous clubs and this is also what you learned from previous class.

721
01:25:23,670 --> 01:25:34,130
And then this class. Not only did this class we recover how to capture this threat.

722
01:25:34,140 --> 01:25:40,530
Right. And then what is the underlying statistic or, you know, methodology to capture this trend?

723
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:48,790
So that is what we will cover in this class. Okay.

724
01:25:48,940 --> 01:25:50,950
So that's a linear versus nonlinear.

725
01:25:50,950 --> 01:25:59,140
And another important, you know, the rationale to even go beyond why we have to go beyond a linear relationship is.

726
01:26:00,150 --> 01:26:06,650
One of one of the examples is temperature. And then so then before you look at the plot.

727
01:26:07,790 --> 01:26:12,140
So what temperature you think you know pepper?

728
01:26:13,190 --> 01:26:23,420
So the population level, not individuals at the population number, people die less or in what temperature people die more.

729
01:26:27,630 --> 01:26:36,460
High temperature or low temperature? So maybe the location is wrong, right?

730
01:26:36,550 --> 01:26:48,970
When I say high versus low and then when I ask you when people die more so, then you have to ask me your question is wrong.

731
01:26:49,390 --> 01:26:53,020
Right. Because I already know.

732
01:26:55,690 --> 01:27:01,180
Frame this question to answer only either high or low.

733
01:27:01,210 --> 01:27:07,000
Right. So that's why the question is wrong. So then how how can we address this issue?

734
01:27:08,230 --> 01:27:11,410
We have to use this temperature not just high and low.

735
01:27:11,830 --> 01:27:14,230
We have to use temperature as it is. Right.

736
01:27:15,100 --> 01:27:26,020
This is why, you know, temperature data suggests that if we are making 10% mortality ratio, then this is not a linear trend.

737
01:27:26,530 --> 01:27:31,480
And then this is you know, we obviously know that medium is optimal.

738
01:27:31,490 --> 01:27:39,730
Temperature around 1530 shows is the or between 15 and 20 is a is a my the temperature.

739
01:27:40,420 --> 01:27:51,190
And then as we expect, if less people die and then extreme hit either high temperature or low temperature.

740
01:27:51,940 --> 01:28:00,990
People die war. But let's say after you take 522 and then I'm not, sir.

741
01:28:02,020 --> 01:28:06,040
Don't get me wrong. So I'm not criticizing biased in fy22, okay?

742
01:28:06,850 --> 01:28:11,680
But just assume that what you know is just linear modeling.

743
01:28:12,570 --> 01:28:16,410
So that's why you can do only when you have this very over.

744
01:28:16,740 --> 01:28:25,480
The only one is like 45880 plus beta 1x1 plus your covariate.

745
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:28,590
So this is the only modeling approach you can do.

746
01:28:29,570 --> 01:28:33,320
So that's why. X1 is temperature.

747
01:28:37,290 --> 01:28:40,960
And if you do this way, then what?

748
01:28:41,220 --> 01:28:45,700
What you will get. You will get these leniently.

749
01:28:47,570 --> 01:28:49,970
So then this alone you how to interpret.

750
01:28:51,970 --> 01:28:58,840
What is your overall conclusion about the relationship between temperature and mortality based on linear modeling?

751
01:29:00,280 --> 01:29:06,440
That's and heritage. Mortality is low at high temperature.

752
01:29:06,680 --> 01:29:09,920
Right. So mortality is high at low temperature.

753
01:29:10,580 --> 01:29:14,209
Even these 2530 social.

754
01:29:14,210 --> 01:29:17,690
So the 9100 Fahrenheit.

755
01:29:17,700 --> 01:29:21,230
Right. Which is not true. Right.

756
01:29:21,890 --> 01:29:25,460
If temperature go up, that lover, people die of war.

757
01:29:26,120 --> 01:29:29,670
But that cannot be captured. If you are.

758
01:29:29,930 --> 01:29:34,010
If you stick to just your mother there. Okay, that's true.

759
01:29:34,460 --> 01:29:40,910
So this is all cause. This is a cardiovascular mortality and a cardiovascular mortality impact war.

760
01:29:41,540 --> 01:29:46,910
So that's why this is not a good approach to fit this type of data.

761
01:29:47,300 --> 01:29:51,080
You have to use this data as it is and then.

762
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:56,510
Right. So try to capture Eugene.

763
01:29:56,780 --> 01:30:03,020
So this type of. Either somebody.

764
01:30:06,180 --> 01:30:12,060
And then in this case, probably. Categorization is better approach.

765
01:30:17,020 --> 01:30:20,050
Right. So that's why you are making.

766
01:30:21,260 --> 01:30:26,540
One group here, another group here or another group here.

767
01:30:27,110 --> 01:30:30,800
And then you are comparing, right? So this is better than linear modeling.

768
01:30:31,400 --> 01:30:34,480
Okay. So they need to regroup.

769
01:30:38,440 --> 01:30:41,940
So this is a better approach. Then.

770
01:30:43,610 --> 01:30:52,180
Lena. But there can't be example, not as a temperature.

771
01:30:52,780 --> 01:30:56,050
Another added input is nutrition, right? Nutrition. Your source.

772
01:30:56,500 --> 01:31:04,690
Sometime, you know, eating more is good, but sometimes too much eating to excess is not good.

773
01:31:04,750 --> 01:31:10,810
Right. So one of the examples is still probably, you know, that vitamin D is good, right?

774
01:31:11,140 --> 01:31:16,570
And then so before too long before 2010 and that before this paper come out,

775
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:23,500
general recommendation is, you know, take vitamin D more vitamin D for your born.

776
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:28,090
Have. Right. Take more. Allow me the question.

777
01:31:28,090 --> 01:31:36,479
Right. But after, you know, we collect this information and they look at the relationship between the vitamin D,

778
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:42,660
this is a circulating vitamin D lover and the frailty among all the women.

779
01:31:42,870 --> 01:31:49,270
And that we found that. So Vitamin D is good until a certain point.

780
01:31:49,990 --> 01:31:55,570
But when the vitamin B lover go beyond that lover, even the frailty risk going up.

781
01:31:56,480 --> 01:32:04,300
Right. So that's why the traditional approach and then, you know, the previous general knowledge about vitamin D.

782
01:32:05,690 --> 01:32:11,309
Based on that. And then if you only stick to linear modeling because you know that vitamin D,

783
01:32:11,310 --> 01:32:17,360
you should have a linear relationship like non monotonic dose response relationship.

784
01:32:18,020 --> 01:32:24,980
Then your conclusion, looking at this data based on your approach, prior knowledge arlesey will be what?

785
01:32:26,430 --> 01:32:33,870
No association between vitamin D and frailty. You'll see this U-shaped curve or maybe a slide.

786
01:32:35,560 --> 01:32:42,370
Donald Trump. Right. But even though this is this is not fully captured through a vitamin D effect.

787
01:32:43,210 --> 01:32:44,670
So if we are not able to capture it.

788
01:32:45,640 --> 01:32:53,830
So I just give you just a few examples, but there are tons of different examples why we have to go beyond in your modeling.

789
01:32:56,670 --> 01:33:00,930
So a threshold if they're hockey stick if that's so. Those are all different.

790
01:33:01,290 --> 01:33:04,740
Some name it's not very important. You have to.

791
01:33:05,500 --> 01:33:14,250
And I. I'm saying that you have to you. So I do not want to say you have to use this, you know, name in your paper.

792
01:33:14,520 --> 01:33:22,740
But when you describe the the phenomenon, this nonlinear dose response curve and that generally we are using this in this name.

793
01:33:23,610 --> 01:33:32,460
So the hockey stick if that for life fat ceiling effect or U-shape or inverted U-shape and sometimes j shape and our shape.

794
01:33:33,650 --> 01:33:43,250
So that's why if you make a dose response relationship and then this is a hockey stick effect and then this we often see in environmental has data,

795
01:33:43,280 --> 01:33:48,440
right? So we do not see.

796
01:33:49,070 --> 01:33:56,870
So the passing effect does not increase until a certain point, and then this toxic effect increase.

797
01:33:57,290 --> 01:34:06,290
And then if we see this type of threshold or hockey stick effect, and this is really important information to to determine.

798
01:34:07,340 --> 01:34:13,380
So what to what level we allow the general population can be exposed.

799
01:34:13,400 --> 01:34:17,980
Right. So that's how we can set the standard.

800
01:34:18,350 --> 01:34:24,760
Actually, I'm allowed at this point because we do not see much, you know, if there and then later.

801
01:34:24,780 --> 01:34:31,960
So that's why we have to go down. If the previous standard was around here, then the syllabus should go down at that level.

802
01:34:32,210 --> 01:34:36,770
Right. And I will talk more about.

803
01:34:37,280 --> 01:34:45,830
So I just simply say this based on the population lover, which means that average the population if.

804
01:34:46,670 --> 01:34:51,740
But in our population, we should not just simply rely on average person.

805
01:34:51,770 --> 01:34:56,430
Right. We, you know, we live together with more susceptible people.

806
01:34:56,450 --> 01:35:02,120
A lot of our population, older population, younger population, which mean that,

807
01:35:03,170 --> 01:35:07,450
you know, this type of total response curve can be applied to that specific population.

808
01:35:07,460 --> 01:35:17,180
So that's why not only, you know, this dose response curve and then setting this standard, at this point, we have to even consider some uncertainty.

809
01:35:17,780 --> 01:35:25,430
So I am I am not talking about this within this class, but when you when you consider risk assessment, you have to even consider that piece.

810
01:35:27,560 --> 01:35:34,130
And then we also see some of that is flow effect, which means that doors and respawns.

811
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:40,110
Most steeper if happened in lower concentration.

812
01:35:41,030 --> 01:35:44,960
So let me show this more like this way.

813
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:50,239
And then us. So when the. The exporter.

814
01:35:50,240 --> 01:35:57,670
Never. You know around is and then if so, respond does not increase in light at a certain point.

815
01:35:58,410 --> 01:36:05,100
And that this type of grant is also very important. Well, so, you know, the.

816
01:36:06,200 --> 01:36:11,200
How much the population benefit when we adjust this stander.

817
01:36:11,930 --> 01:36:16,460
And then, you know, let's say current standard is here.

818
01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:18,320
This is a current standard.

819
01:36:22,620 --> 01:36:31,080
And then if you if you set a new standard here and then the population doesn't get benefit anything right from this type of grant.

820
01:36:31,410 --> 01:36:40,650
So if you really want to achieve maximum benefit, then this curve clearly shows that at least you have to go, you know, around you a.

821
01:36:41,130 --> 01:36:49,660
Right. Otherwise, even though you spend a lot of money to lower population explicitly there but nobody gets some benefit.

822
01:36:49,680 --> 01:36:58,560
Right. So this is this is not good in terms of this cost benefit effect and that you have to even choose going beyond so below this level.

823
01:37:00,930 --> 01:37:07,220
And then you shake or be sort of seen on. And the inverted U-shape as we're.

824
01:37:09,030 --> 01:37:12,300
So I'm going to give you some example here.

825
01:37:12,990 --> 01:37:18,870
That blood red 11, the blood pressure. And then, as you can see, this is a 1984 very long time ago.

826
01:37:19,350 --> 01:37:22,260
And at the time, this is a clinical paper.

827
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:31,280
Clinical trial on our paper, and that even though they made a blood lab below the level of our continuous care,

828
01:37:31,730 --> 01:37:35,930
well, at that time, just general practices after use.

829
01:37:35,930 --> 01:37:40,130
Correct. And then major bloodletting never continuous way.

830
01:37:40,820 --> 01:37:49,670
But when you present the return, they take a right and then present this way so that at the time nobody criticizes the approach.

831
01:37:50,150 --> 01:37:58,760
This time, if you analyze this way in this summit, then your paper will be rejected because you lose that information.

832
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:11,480
But even there we can get some information so they'll association is not monotonic increase in pattern we see some of these

833
01:38:11,480 --> 01:38:20,960
going up and that slow down and even go down at high concentration and then this trend will the same in the later study.

834
01:38:21,800 --> 01:38:26,750
So this is a broader level cover and then below the pressure relationship.

835
01:38:27,900 --> 01:38:31,470
And then, as you can see, this is one of the smoothing techniques.

836
01:38:37,060 --> 01:38:46,780
And we will cover this low is later. So one of those imaging technique and then you can see the this monotonically linear relationship

837
01:38:46,990 --> 01:38:56,380
and then this smoothing plot they coincide they in good agreement until concentration above 15.

838
01:38:56,440 --> 01:39:06,280
Right and then legs and then beyond this point, you know, this smoothing plot going down but this going down pat on these is a good pattern.

839
01:39:06,280 --> 01:39:13,630
Or do you agree this pattern is is reflecting the true pattern in terms of this lab effect.

840
01:39:15,350 --> 01:39:21,320
Why not? There's like one that so looks like this.

841
01:39:22,360 --> 01:39:26,470
Downward pattern, heavily influenced by this outlier.

842
01:39:26,740 --> 01:39:35,559
Right. So this is why when you do this smoothing technique and then show this prior and then

843
01:39:35,560 --> 01:39:40,840
you have to be careful it because smoothing approach can be influenced by outliers.

844
01:39:41,260 --> 01:39:46,010
Okay. And even later, we will address this issue.

845
01:39:48,570 --> 01:39:52,450
And now another example. So a lot of leather leather and I can children.

846
01:39:53,500 --> 01:39:57,310
And education. So this is the level level on X-axis.

847
01:39:57,640 --> 01:40:02,980
And the IQ on the Y axis. And then there are several modeling approach.

848
01:40:03,250 --> 01:40:08,440
One is linear motor. And then another one is.

849
01:40:10,610 --> 01:40:16,400
Local locally here. And this is a linear.

850
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:32,530
So the same data and that depending on what statistical approach or total response relationship approach you choose.

851
01:40:34,680 --> 01:40:41,300
The interpretation should be different, and then that impaired your policy a different way.

852
01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:45,770
So anyone can surf after you looking at the air.

853
01:40:45,920 --> 01:40:58,100
So if you are a risk assessment person and said that's why the CDC asked you, okay, analyze this data and then please give me a recommendation.

854
01:40:58,400 --> 01:41:07,250
How so? How we so what lever we have to choose to protect our children in terms of this neurotoxicity.

855
01:41:08,280 --> 01:41:15,300
And then I just want to give you a say about 30 seconds and then think about this plug.

856
01:41:15,750 --> 01:41:22,470
And then if you are if you will ask to do that risk assessment, how do you want to do?

857
01:41:23,340 --> 01:41:30,300
And then what state is going to put you on? It should. And then based on that approach and then what is your recommendation?

858
01:41:55,510 --> 01:41:59,440
Anyone want to share your idea, your thought?

859
01:42:13,770 --> 01:42:17,950
Nor. I would say there's no statement them.

860
01:42:19,500 --> 01:42:23,250
No safer lover. For which one?

861
01:42:24,680 --> 01:42:33,820
Both. Or either. Or. Both?

862
01:42:34,140 --> 01:42:37,350
Yeah, both. Right. So lineal model in your mother.

863
01:42:37,470 --> 01:42:40,990
Both suggest that there is no threshold. Right.

864
01:42:41,470 --> 01:42:50,260
We don't see any threshold effect, which means that when we lower the stand there, we can protect children of more children.

865
01:42:50,290 --> 01:42:53,919
Right. So that's why the threat there is no threshold effect.

866
01:42:53,920 --> 01:43:00,200
This is very important finding. Right. Linear approach and the linear approach.

867
01:43:00,250 --> 01:43:08,340
Both can suggest that way. Right. Another one, another important observation from this.

868
01:43:15,470 --> 01:43:20,850
So Logan, in your relationship is that, uh, you know, for example.

869
01:43:22,110 --> 01:43:26,250
Below the level 40 between 40 and 80.

870
01:43:29,050 --> 01:43:33,760
So what's happening between these linear modeling versus the low volume modeling?

871
01:43:38,930 --> 01:43:43,460
Global in your modeling. We don't see much change in IQ.

872
01:43:44,330 --> 01:43:50,900
Right? Reno modeling we see because this is some legal modeling we see monotonic decline.

873
01:43:51,020 --> 01:43:56,270
Right. So that's why, you know, within this range.

874
01:43:57,320 --> 01:44:02,390
If you are using selenium modeling, then you are not able to find.

875
01:44:03,460 --> 01:44:11,650
So so certainly lover of this brotherly love and the when lover beyond this certain lover.

876
01:44:12,550 --> 01:44:19,180
And then we don't see much change in the this IQ and maybe this linear modeling

877
01:44:19,180 --> 01:44:26,050
is because you stick to this linear model and then this from the previous range.

878
01:44:26,410 --> 01:44:29,580
And that's why this linear model it does not captured are true.

879
01:44:30,820 --> 01:44:37,030
True phenomenon. What's happening in this high range of political landlubber?

880
01:44:37,330 --> 01:44:40,600
Okay. So that's why this bios.

881
01:44:42,490 --> 01:44:46,940
Through relationship. And then locally in your.

882
01:44:48,230 --> 01:44:52,210
However, less buyers. To describe what's happening.

883
01:44:54,640 --> 01:45:01,810
Risk assessment standpoint. And then you feel you didn't have linear modeling and then no matter which point.

884
01:45:02,850 --> 01:45:08,040
You choose. If it is just a very arbitrary decision, right?

885
01:45:08,430 --> 01:45:11,630
You are not able to accept her. Know how?

886
01:45:11,730 --> 01:45:15,890
So how? What proportion of children can benefit?

887
01:45:15,900 --> 01:45:21,540
And then comparing. And then this role in your modeling.

888
01:45:21,540 --> 01:45:24,750
So, you know, the maximum benefit can happen.

889
01:45:25,780 --> 01:45:29,020
So until probably the benefit doesn't.

890
01:45:30,060 --> 01:45:36,030
You don't achieve much benefit until you lower the concentration below around here.

891
01:45:36,060 --> 01:45:43,740
Right. Maximum benefit can achieve if you lower concentration below this level.

892
01:45:44,130 --> 01:45:49,040
Right. But when you do real modeling, you cannot get that information right.

893
01:45:50,490 --> 01:45:55,590
So this is a really important information because previously risk assessment tool.

894
01:45:55,590 --> 01:46:03,749
And then just using the original modeling, you know, no matter which point you are shooting it to just arbitrary point and that based on the,

895
01:46:03,750 --> 01:46:12,270
you know, the how much, you know, the, you know, you have money to who you know to run your government.

896
01:46:13,650 --> 01:46:22,320
But it's not based on the true, you know, this risk analysis and then the what proportion of population can benefit.

897
01:46:22,830 --> 01:46:27,490
But even after you. So after you try.

898
01:46:28,070 --> 01:46:31,080
Non-linear relationship and that you can achieve this goal.

899
01:46:31,590 --> 01:46:38,010
So that's why in this case the local linear modeling can provide this one and that this is.

900
01:46:39,200 --> 01:46:42,950
Conform to by when you are. When we are using this, Lois.

901
01:46:45,960 --> 01:46:48,750
In your relationship. Hey.

902
01:46:50,720 --> 01:46:58,770
And then this local linear pattern and the lowest smoothing pattern, they are in agreement and then provide this information.

903
01:46:58,790 --> 01:47:06,980
So we will be using this tour for the risk assessment and that we've been practice in this class over this semester.

904
01:47:07,310 --> 01:47:10,610
Okay. All right. Almost done.

905
01:47:11,270 --> 01:47:15,280
So that sort the new recommendation to define elevated blood alcohol level.

906
01:47:16,250 --> 01:47:20,270
So 24. Concentration below.

907
01:47:20,420 --> 01:47:30,770
So, you know, so the ten and then that go down to five and then 2021 even this concentration go down to 3.5.

908
01:47:31,100 --> 01:47:34,909
And now how seriously determined this, you know,

909
01:47:34,910 --> 01:47:46,400
elevate below the level of her guideline and it's based on the you know what is the concentration over this top 22.5%.

910
01:47:46,970 --> 01:47:54,480
This is not based on the scientific. Risk assessment.

911
01:48:01,500 --> 01:48:08,560
Not based on. So that those response.

912
01:48:13,370 --> 01:48:20,310
Analysis. So that's why we always criticize whenever CDC determined this level.

913
01:48:20,330 --> 01:48:23,760
Even now, 3.5 is a it's a very low level.

914
01:48:24,100 --> 01:48:32,390
We agree that. But we are arguing that this even this this level should go down to two micrograms per deciliter,

915
01:48:33,320 --> 01:48:37,550
and that is two micrograms per deciliter is is from this.

916
01:48:38,660 --> 01:48:41,630
And then we can get maximum benefit, right?

917
01:48:42,320 --> 01:48:50,420
And then even below two is it's obviously good, but it's like a technically it's very difficult to achieve that goal.

918
01:48:50,420 --> 01:48:59,240
So that's why we want to go down. We are recommending scientists always recommend going down to this too, but the CDC still use this.

919
01:49:00,350 --> 01:49:06,480
Is. Approach to set this guideline open.

920
01:49:12,700 --> 01:49:21,700
So the another example that I want to give you so far is a poor and poor or poorly and perfluoroalkyl substances.

921
01:49:22,240 --> 01:49:26,770
I don't know how many have horrible papers, you know, or papers.

922
01:49:26,980 --> 01:49:32,270
Right. Okay. Purpose and cognitive function, in all the other words.

923
01:49:32,570 --> 01:49:42,620
And then so this is a long story, so I will not say all about this, but before I did this study,

924
01:49:43,550 --> 01:49:49,910
even though we know that people's is a toxic chemical and animal, studies suggest that this is a neurotoxin.

925
01:49:51,150 --> 01:50:00,330
But three a piece study before this study was to show that the relationship between purpose and cognition.

926
01:50:01,620 --> 01:50:10,150
So privacy is good for cognition. Which means that when we look at the population data, we see that high.

927
01:50:10,270 --> 01:50:16,090
So people with a high p fossil ever heavier have a better cognition, right?

928
01:50:17,560 --> 01:50:21,040
But the scientists cannot lie after they look at the data.

929
01:50:21,160 --> 01:50:29,590
The data show us that, you know, those people with high people, silver, they have a much better cognitive cognitive score.

930
01:50:30,010 --> 01:50:36,370
So what can we do? Right. So that's why before this study and whenever I look at those papers,

931
01:50:36,370 --> 01:50:44,050
I was I was not happy reading those paper and then was thinking that, can we do more?

932
01:50:47,230 --> 01:50:57,760
And then the previous story they focused on. Obviously the first one is just a little stick, a linear relationship only look at the linear modeling,

933
01:50:58,930 --> 01:51:03,040
even though probably they also try some some modeling and then.

934
01:51:03,040 --> 01:51:05,290
But they didn't find anything. Okay.

935
01:51:06,370 --> 01:51:17,050
And then this is a the relationship between peop one of the papers and a combination and what is your conclusion when you look at this type of plot?

936
01:51:18,280 --> 01:51:23,970
What do you want to do? So how do you want to conclude? The relationship is.

937
01:51:24,510 --> 01:51:27,930
So the high score means the better cognition.

938
01:51:28,140 --> 01:51:31,580
Low scoring means poor cognition. So that's all over.

939
01:51:31,860 --> 01:51:35,490
Do you see some inverse relationship?

940
01:51:36,240 --> 01:51:41,710
Right. But it's not totally monotonic dose response curve.

941
01:51:41,720 --> 01:51:46,850
Right. But over time, you may also want to conclude that the relationship is inverse.

942
01:51:47,450 --> 01:51:51,810
So that's why high people's better cognition, right?

943
01:51:55,870 --> 01:52:08,200
And but first one is I show this plot and then that's why this this is the relationship is certain raids that we see going up at on.

944
01:52:09,220 --> 01:52:12,310
And then after this point. And then going down. Petr.

945
01:52:13,480 --> 01:52:20,920
Well, actually, this is the better score. And then actually they made a mistake.

946
01:52:20,920 --> 01:52:29,530
So this is a poor. So that's why the overall trend inverse is is the right direction we expect, right?

947
01:52:31,420 --> 01:52:35,040
And they here we see there is a dog going, apparently.

948
01:52:35,440 --> 01:52:43,750
So that's why if we are comparing the person in this range and then this range, then you will see that high exposure is good, right?

949
01:52:44,380 --> 01:52:50,530
So if we are shown this plot, then even though this is not perfect hockey stick pattern,

950
01:52:51,400 --> 01:52:58,780
but the industry side will say that, oh, we see the the cognition we the population get benefit.

951
01:52:59,110 --> 01:53:04,000
So that's why it's okay. We allow concentration up to this lever.

952
01:53:04,690 --> 01:53:10,030
Right. And then beyond this lover. Okay, I see the correlation decline.

953
01:53:10,040 --> 01:53:16,160
So that's why we want to set. Stand out at this point.

954
01:53:16,620 --> 01:53:22,440
Because even though this population get panicky, allowing this this much exposure.

955
01:53:22,620 --> 01:53:27,879
Right. But there are so many different considerations.

956
01:53:27,880 --> 01:53:34,960
You have to you have to do because we consider this people this is a this is the law, the biomarker.

957
01:53:40,130 --> 01:53:52,580
Which means that so epidemic epidemiologists always consider when you say biomarker which is not through exposure biomarker is a proxy exposure.

958
01:53:52,610 --> 01:53:58,500
Right. So that's why if you are using biomarker, then you have to consider.

959
01:53:58,520 --> 01:54:05,420
So what factor? Influence.

960
01:54:08,400 --> 01:54:15,020
Volume up. Which means that.

961
01:54:17,910 --> 01:54:28,959
This is all the dirt. And then we have to understand when we get A's and then physiologically what's happening and

962
01:54:28,960 --> 01:54:33,220
then whether or not those physiological effects are impacted by a lack of concentration.

963
01:54:33,700 --> 01:54:41,320
And that's why I, I stratify this population into normal kidney function and then poor kidney function.

964
01:54:41,590 --> 01:54:52,860
And this is because when you get or you lose your kidney function and the you are not able to filter the this kind of toxic chemical.

965
01:54:53,440 --> 01:55:03,610
And that's why sometime your your kidney cannot discharge this toxic chemical and then those toxic chemicals can be reappear.

966
01:55:04,480 --> 01:55:11,010
And then going back to your circulation. And then you will see even higher concentration.

967
01:55:11,160 --> 01:55:18,809
Right. So that's why if you if your population mixed with this normal kidney function and then poor kidney function,

968
01:55:18,810 --> 01:55:22,050
then that will not give you the true phenomenon.

969
01:55:22,590 --> 01:55:29,790
That's why I stratified this population into this trouble. And then only with normal kidney function.

970
01:55:33,120 --> 01:55:43,120
And actually this is a normal kidney function. And then I see that the association is clearly monotonic linear relationship,

971
01:55:43,750 --> 01:55:50,980
inverse association and the statistically significant association, which means that the previous study.

972
01:55:52,400 --> 01:55:57,680
Concluding high fives is good for cognition.

973
01:55:58,490 --> 01:56:04,420
Could it be? Not true because they didn't consider this.

974
01:56:05,680 --> 01:56:08,710
The kidney function can impact biomarker concentration.

975
01:56:09,730 --> 01:56:13,450
And then this can be captured by this nonlinear.

976
01:56:16,230 --> 01:56:21,570
Relationship. And then I try to capture this after stratification.

977
01:56:26,650 --> 01:56:29,380
By keeping a culture.

978
01:56:33,090 --> 01:56:41,850
So that's why the epidemiologists need to understand your population and what factor impaired your exposure, what factor into your outcome.

979
01:56:42,060 --> 01:56:45,740
And that without that understanding and then just simply look at the data.

980
01:56:46,040 --> 01:56:53,160
Data. You should not just simply let the data tell you and then the conclusion you have to understand.

981
01:56:53,370 --> 01:57:00,280
And then based on your analogy, you can figure this out and then properly and then make the the,

982
01:57:00,510 --> 01:57:06,930
the so the crap inference in terms of the relationship between people and companies.

983
01:57:07,080 --> 01:57:10,410
Otherwise, you are making a, you know,

984
01:57:10,710 --> 01:57:16,920
different conclusion and that that can lead to and sometimes you scientific findings

985
01:57:16,920 --> 01:57:24,540
can be misused and then by the industry and then that policy impact the policy future.

986
01:57:25,620 --> 01:57:34,560
So for any study where we're looking at biomarker concentrations, aside from all the confounders,

987
01:57:35,760 --> 01:57:43,380
we also have to consider the factors that can influence the biomarker concentration itself.

988
01:57:43,470 --> 01:57:56,010
Right. So the just give you in this case, the pitfalls and then the privacy is a very interesting and important chemical because it's important.

989
01:57:56,160 --> 01:58:08,069
So it's difficult to measure body burden. So that's why unless you collect information where this person live in the past several

990
01:58:08,070 --> 01:58:14,700
decades and then what potential people's sources are in that residential location.

991
01:58:15,120 --> 01:58:20,280
So then you are not able to capture true body burden and that exposure are in the past.

992
01:58:20,820 --> 01:58:28,470
So that's why the AP study, in a simple way, is just collecting blood and then look at the blood, the concentration.

993
01:58:28,770 --> 01:58:33,420
But kidney function is a 1 to 1 factor that impacts biomarker.

994
01:58:33,810 --> 01:58:37,980
Another one is, you know, for women. So even though.

995
01:58:39,300 --> 01:58:42,660
Same, you know, household men and women.

996
01:58:42,690 --> 01:58:48,890
So that's why we. So suppose that these two men and women woman have same exposure labor.

997
01:58:48,900 --> 01:58:52,350
But if you look at their proper concentration, then you will see the difference.

998
01:58:52,800 --> 01:59:02,100
And this is because one of the main excretion pathways of menstruation and then menstruation lower your blood concentration,

999
01:59:02,100 --> 01:59:06,750
even though those two terms subject have same of exposure.

1000
01:59:06,780 --> 01:59:12,060
Right. So that's a when you look at the biomarker, it doesn't give you true extra exposure.

1001
01:59:12,450 --> 01:59:19,769
And then if if you do not understand the P first bio metabolism and the bio kinetics,

1002
01:59:19,770 --> 01:59:25,770
then you are not able to, you know, incorporate this understanding into your data analysis.

1003
01:59:26,010 --> 01:59:27,930
And the you cannot figure that out.

1004
01:59:28,470 --> 01:59:36,959
So the previous is one example, but you know how we measure metal in urine, metal in blood, urine is another factor.

1005
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:45,450
And then in this class, we recover when you measure your concentration in blood and the improvement in urine,

1006
01:59:45,450 --> 01:59:50,580
and then what statistical considerations should be made and then how we can address that issue.

1007
01:59:50,670 --> 01:59:55,160
So we will cover that. Okay. All right.

1008
01:59:55,830 --> 02:00:07,440
So that's why I hope this is a good example for and also motivate you why we want to go beyond just simple linear modeling approach.

1009
02:00:07,440 --> 02:00:16,280
And then to better understand this relationship between environment exposure and the health outcome and make a proper inference.

1010
02:00:17,280 --> 02:00:26,189
Many cases, if you look at the epidemiology paper, in many cases some time we are not able to address this issue.

1011
02:00:26,190 --> 02:00:30,030
And then conclusion is not what we supposed to do.

1012
02:00:30,150 --> 02:00:34,379
Right. And and then sometimes that information is misused.

1013
02:00:34,380 --> 02:00:46,110
And later, I will give you another example how this scientific information can be misused and that impact the policy, especially EPA policy during.

1014
02:00:47,440 --> 02:00:50,980
Former president. Okay. Okay. All right.

1015
02:00:51,760 --> 02:00:59,260
Uh, so lord knows if again, nonso nn nmd rc non monotonic dose response curve,

1016
02:01:00,040 --> 02:01:03,909
and sometime we call the low dose effect in the nominal Plato's response curve.

1017
02:01:03,910 --> 02:01:08,140
And I hope this is a very important, you know, calm.

1018
02:01:08,440 --> 02:01:13,900
And then in overall type of image with not only a few the of others are just involved here.

1019
02:01:14,110 --> 02:01:23,110
We talk a lot about this issue. So please look at this and then I strongly recommend this paper.

1020
02:01:23,110 --> 02:01:26,409
This is about 100 page paper, the very long paper,

1021
02:01:26,410 --> 02:01:34,230
but very thorough and then include really important information about this law to the effect in a normal Plato's response curve.

1022
02:01:34,590 --> 02:01:39,640
Okay. So the question is, should we stick to linear regression?

1023
02:01:40,630 --> 02:01:43,690
Your answer is. No.

1024
02:01:44,310 --> 02:01:49,350
Right. What other method can be used.

1025
02:01:50,970 --> 02:01:55,230
Statistical approach to modeling this non-linear relationship parametric

1026
02:01:55,230 --> 02:02:01,500
approach transformation polynomial parameter parameterization quadratic cubic.

1027
02:02:01,770 --> 02:02:08,759
And then you can we can also use spline and the non parametric approach spline and the lowest function.

1028
02:02:08,760 --> 02:02:14,240
So we will cover all of this approach in this class. How exciting.

1029
02:02:16,730 --> 02:02:22,600
Okay. And then. So. Former director of NHS and National.

1030
02:02:22,970 --> 02:02:28,070
So NHS is a National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.

1031
02:02:28,440 --> 02:02:33,290
The A.P. is a national toxicology program, so a former director will end up on board.

1032
02:02:34,910 --> 02:02:42,080
You know, we love this. And then, you know, she mentioned that nonlinear relationships should not be dismissed.

1033
02:02:43,190 --> 02:02:48,620
And that to determine how our understanding of load with the effect and nonmonetary response

1034
02:02:48,620 --> 02:02:54,950
influenced the way risk assessment are performed or chemicals with endocrine disrupting activities.

1035
02:02:55,460 --> 02:03:03,350
And so I will also have a chance to talk more about these endocrine disrupting chemicals and the potential this new low dose effect.

1036
02:03:03,350 --> 02:03:15,950
And then. And a and then DRC. So the goal is better linear, logistic and parcel and even survivor and and logical data analysis.

1037
02:03:16,160 --> 02:03:19,490
And we want to achieve this in this class.

1038
02:03:19,760 --> 02:03:24,489
Okay. Okay, so this is over.

1039
02:03:24,490 --> 02:03:32,500
And then the rest of the slide is about the data we will be using, know the class activity.

1040
02:03:32,530 --> 02:03:40,120
So we will use two data set. One is this enhanced three plot level and the plot of present high potential.

1041
02:03:40,360 --> 02:03:44,490
So that will be data for class activity.

1042
02:03:45,130 --> 02:03:49,630
Second dataset is your home of data, which I look at.

1043
02:03:49,630 --> 02:04:00,460
So I already mentioned before that looking at the relationship between arsenic, so urinary arsenic and blood glucose level and diabetes.

1044
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:06,310
So that will be your other data set.

1045
02:04:06,520 --> 02:04:18,840
So for class data set and then I recommend you read those two papers which will give you some basic background of this plot,

1046
02:04:18,880 --> 02:04:27,970
present the plot over in Enhanced. And then so I will introduce this next week when we actually use this data.

1047
02:04:29,400 --> 02:04:32,610
And the homework dataset I already mentioned. So homework one.

1048
02:04:32,610 --> 02:04:35,110
So after this class I will release this, you know,

1049
02:04:35,130 --> 02:04:44,610
publish this homework one and then this is a paper by Dr. Navas asking our setting exposure and prevalence of diabetes.

1050
02:04:46,590 --> 02:04:50,760
And then you will critique. This paper.

1051
02:04:53,050 --> 02:05:05,379
Okay. So 1120 and then so let's take a ten minute break and then when you come back so you can come back any and then you can even start.

1052
02:05:05,380 --> 02:05:14,830
Chris So I'm going to give you the, uh, this is right now, this is the self-assessment.

1053
02:05:14,980 --> 02:05:26,080
Okay, so no warning, but try, try your, your best to answer this because some ten minute break and then we will review this question.

1054
02:05:28,210 --> 02:05:44,868
11. 35. I do not think it is an issue that.

1055
02:05:50,995 --> 02:05:54,895
Okay. So let's wrap it together.

1056
02:05:57,175 --> 02:06:02,305
How many fans fought over that? Okay.

1057
02:06:03,315 --> 02:06:09,035
So they're working, right? Uh, let's check this together.

1058
02:06:09,065 --> 02:06:15,455
So the first page. So compare blood pressure, liver between exposed and unexposed group.

1059
02:06:15,635 --> 02:06:21,575
So what approach? You have to use that test and.

1060
02:06:26,445 --> 02:06:36,435
The only one to test is the only answer is the fossil wilcoxon wilcoxon sum rank some.

1061
02:06:37,095 --> 02:06:40,145
Yeah. Why?

1062
02:06:42,385 --> 02:06:53,305
I don't know. I just used that for. Okay. And then so you are comparing this two groups of blood pressure.

1063
02:06:53,355 --> 02:07:05,515
If blood pressure is not normally distributed, then t test is a promise through approach which require this normal distribution assumption.

1064
02:07:06,505 --> 02:07:14,515
If it doesn't meet this assumption, then you want to use this non parametric alternative or prepares.

1065
02:07:14,785 --> 02:07:19,325
Is wilcoxon rank some test like one of the sample sizes?

1066
02:07:20,665 --> 02:07:23,695
No, that's not the one. So that's a different one.

1067
02:07:24,265 --> 02:07:28,075
Okay. So we may talk about that later. Okay.

1068
02:07:28,105 --> 02:07:31,405
So there aren't yet tests and workshops around some tests. Anything else?

1069
02:07:32,895 --> 02:07:38,435
That's the only one. The only to. What else?

1070
02:07:44,075 --> 02:07:47,105
It's okay. Speak up, please.

1071
02:07:51,555 --> 02:07:56,735
Everyone on their right to insert with care. What about?

1072
02:07:57,915 --> 02:08:09,505
Another approach to win outcome is continuous. I guess you could do a recession regression, linear regression.

1073
02:08:10,795 --> 02:08:18,265
You can use Rainier linear regression. Yeah. Anything else?

1074
02:08:19,205 --> 02:08:26,685
No. What about the Nova?

1075
02:08:29,285 --> 02:08:34,235
So what is your understanding of the when you use when you need to use ANOVA?

1076
02:08:35,445 --> 02:08:41,295
Comparing mean of the groups. But in genera more than two groups.

1077
02:08:41,555 --> 02:08:47,715
Right. But even though the the comparison is just two groups, it's fine.

1078
02:08:48,345 --> 02:08:54,315
Right. You can use that even though because we have this task generally we are using Keepass.

1079
02:08:54,345 --> 02:09:01,955
Right. Okay. So then what is the alternative non parametric version for ANOVA?

1080
02:09:05,275 --> 02:09:10,555
If outcome is not normally distributed. Which approach you can use.

1081
02:09:20,305 --> 02:09:26,685
Chris Wallace test cook. So that's why.

1082
02:09:27,845 --> 02:09:38,505
So. Yeah, so I know so the previous class and maybe you just link you know connect this one and one and what's a one on one but.

1083
02:09:39,485 --> 02:09:50,735
Place so you can think of maybe for a way to look at this type of question so in this case T test anova linear regression wilcoxon rank sum test.

1084
02:09:51,155 --> 02:09:54,425
And across all this test, all of them can be used.

1085
02:09:54,425 --> 02:10:00,814
Okay number to compare lung function in harassment before and afterwards.

1086
02:10:00,815 --> 02:10:09,125
An exposure. Which one? Guaranteed pair the t test.

1087
02:10:10,745 --> 02:10:16,385
And. What is the non parametric version?

1088
02:10:20,135 --> 02:10:23,255
And Wilcoxon signed the test.

1089
02:10:25,855 --> 02:10:32,065
The three compared lung function among never smokers, former smokers, current smokers.

1090
02:10:32,395 --> 02:10:39,595
How many of you are comparing three Crisco or less pairs?

1091
02:10:40,105 --> 02:10:44,545
That's not current at 31. So that's why we.

1092
02:10:44,545 --> 02:10:49,925
Which won a nova. If we want to use ANOVA, what?

1093
02:10:49,925 --> 02:10:56,825
You have to make sure. No. Outcome is normally distributed, right?

1094
02:10:57,605 --> 02:10:59,225
So in this case, a long form is shown.

1095
02:10:59,525 --> 02:11:10,055
So if anyone has to look at long before then the human population generally we will see lung function is highly skilled.

1096
02:11:10,385 --> 02:11:14,735
Right. So then if we want to use ANOVA, then what you have to do.

1097
02:11:17,685 --> 02:11:21,225
Logo transform logo transform lung function.

1098
02:11:21,915 --> 02:11:26,745
There why you have to use cross calls test anything else other than those to.

1099
02:11:30,255 --> 02:11:33,965
High skill is when you are using Chi Square.

1100
02:11:34,305 --> 02:11:43,205
Outcome is. So all of this concern is depending on characteristics of your variable, right?

1101
02:11:43,625 --> 02:11:52,175
So that's why based on the characteristic in this case lung function, which measure literacy, which means a continuous scale.

1102
02:11:53,195 --> 02:11:57,545
So then the chi square test is not a relevant one.

1103
02:11:58,145 --> 02:12:09,375
Okay. What is. Answer from number one.

1104
02:12:11,375 --> 02:12:15,005
Outcome is continuous linear regression.

1105
02:12:16,175 --> 02:12:23,015
All the time. Linear regression. If we want to use that linear regression then and then.

1106
02:12:23,345 --> 02:12:26,884
Smoking status as your exposure variable.

1107
02:12:26,885 --> 02:12:30,785
Then how to moderate smoking status.

1108
02:12:33,755 --> 02:12:38,475
Mm hmm. One, two, three.

1109
02:12:39,285 --> 02:12:42,725
Continuous. No. Yes.

1110
02:12:44,425 --> 02:12:51,175
Challenge category. Modeling strategy category should be be fit.

1111
02:12:51,475 --> 02:13:02,215
What way? I know in SAS your your suspense you specify smoking status on the class a statement, right?

1112
02:13:02,875 --> 02:13:08,835
Well, what does that mean? Smoking three smoking grog.

1113
02:13:08,875 --> 02:13:14,185
How? Smoking. What about a moderate? Using what?

1114
02:13:17,965 --> 02:13:21,735
Do. Yeah.

1115
02:13:21,985 --> 02:13:28,605
You can consider ordinal variable, which means that you are feeding smoking status 1 to 3 as a 1 to 3.

1116
02:13:28,645 --> 02:13:34,135
So you are comparing one versus two, two versus three as the organizer scale.

1117
02:13:34,765 --> 02:13:41,935
But ordinal means that it's a continuous right ordinal and continuous the same right.

1118
02:13:42,475 --> 02:13:51,095
Then how you can fit the smoking. Tommy How many?

1119
02:13:52,385 --> 02:13:59,165
How many? Tommy Vario birth to two, depending on which group is your reference group.

1120
02:13:59,405 --> 02:14:09,065
Okay. Okay. Number four association between brother, leather lover and systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

1121
02:14:09,095 --> 02:14:16,665
So just simply consider systolic. Linear regression.

1122
02:14:17,055 --> 02:14:22,515
Y. Y you cannot use p pairs or ANOVA.

1123
02:14:25,075 --> 02:14:35,935
Exposure is continuous. So unless you tie, customize or categorize into, you know, low medium three or high three group.

1124
02:14:37,215 --> 02:14:40,545
Then the only option is linear regression.

1125
02:14:40,955 --> 02:14:48,885
Okay, number five. Association of Blood Pressure with blood, leather, liver and smoking status.

1126
02:14:50,385 --> 02:14:57,945
Which means that now how many variables you have due to exposure variable the right to covariate.

1127
02:14:58,575 --> 02:15:02,845
So then which approach? Colder and colder is one.

1128
02:15:03,135 --> 02:15:06,435
Right. And linear regression. Linear regression.

1129
02:15:07,465 --> 02:15:10,675
All the time when outcome is continuous. Right.

1130
02:15:11,695 --> 02:15:15,985
Number six association between blood alert and blood pressure.

1131
02:15:16,735 --> 02:15:22,105
And these associations increase linearly across age groups.

1132
02:15:24,565 --> 02:15:33,515
Which one? Hasbro in the past following a trend but through which approach to school.

1133
02:15:36,685 --> 02:15:47,815
Now you have how many exposure variables? You have a right.

1134
02:15:48,595 --> 02:15:53,715
So that's why. Mother. Which mother you are, you dear?

1135
02:15:54,945 --> 02:16:02,465
Outcome is what? A lot of pressure. Which is a continuous outcome.

1136
02:16:02,855 --> 02:16:12,605
So linear regression. But then how can you evaluate whether or not the association linearly increase age group?

1137
02:16:12,615 --> 02:16:16,105
So then how should you fit those variable?

1138
02:16:21,955 --> 02:16:28,135
How age and then Balotelli. Balotelli the lover should of fit should to be fit in this in this case.

1139
02:16:31,365 --> 02:16:37,095
So AIDS can be if it continues or I think it's so category is fine.

1140
02:16:37,695 --> 02:16:44,335
But the main point is. So.

1141
02:16:44,845 --> 02:16:54,864
So I will interpret this little bit differently. So whether or not this enso this association linearly increase across age group means

1142
02:16:54,865 --> 02:17:00,595
that you want to evaluate whether or not this association in different age groups,

1143
02:17:01,255 --> 02:17:04,975
same or different. What does that mean?

1144
02:17:05,875 --> 02:17:09,175
What you are looking what you want to evaluate from discussion?

1145
02:17:10,175 --> 02:17:13,275
Interact interaction. Okay.

1146
02:17:14,235 --> 02:17:19,425
Interaction. So that's why you have to fit this user interaction.

1147
02:17:20,385 --> 02:17:33,675
So that's why the epidemiologic standpoint this is you want to evaluate whether blood related liver and blood pressure association modified by a.

1148
02:17:34,705 --> 02:17:37,825
Okay. So that's why this is an effective modification question.

1149
02:17:38,825 --> 02:17:44,975
Static statistical year can be done using incorporating interaction.

1150
02:17:46,445 --> 02:17:54,815
Okay. Number seven, prevalence of breast cancer between those we dealt with the breakup gene.

1151
02:17:56,295 --> 02:18:04,395
Now. Outcome is what? Outcome is breast cancer.

1152
02:18:05,575 --> 02:18:08,865
Yes or no outcome? Binary outcome.

1153
02:18:10,745 --> 02:18:16,115
Which approach do? Jesus.

1154
02:18:16,535 --> 02:18:21,455
Fetuses. When when you are comparing, you are comparing mean.

1155
02:18:22,915 --> 02:18:27,865
Which means the outcome characteristics is what? Continuous.

1156
02:18:28,705 --> 02:18:33,485
This is binary. Okay.

1157
02:18:35,375 --> 02:18:41,425
So that's what? Which one? Chi Square.

1158
02:18:42,925 --> 02:18:47,315
And. This is the logistic regression.

1159
02:18:48,535 --> 02:18:51,785
Okay. Okay.

1160
02:18:51,815 --> 02:18:56,945
Number eight Association between history of exposure to asbestos.

1161
02:18:58,405 --> 02:19:03,865
So historically exposure, which means that how many years you have been exposed to asbestos,

1162
02:19:04,195 --> 02:19:09,925
which is a continuous and lung cancer in a matched case control study.

1163
02:19:13,345 --> 02:19:16,595
Meds. The case control study. Which one?

1164
02:19:20,495 --> 02:19:23,615
Mm hmm. Logistic regression.

1165
02:19:24,485 --> 02:19:35,035
But you have to be careful. Logistic regression. In a way to you match, which means that you need a stratification steamer.

1166
02:19:36,195 --> 02:19:40,095
To match your case and control your.

1167
02:19:41,265 --> 02:19:49,685
And another one. Make me my test so we have no time.

1168
02:19:49,685 --> 02:19:58,564
So let me move fast. Okay. Number nine prevalence of hypertension across quartiles of blood.

1169
02:19:58,565 --> 02:20:06,075
Relative cover the four groups of blood 11 lover. Prevalence of hypertension.

1170
02:20:06,075 --> 02:20:09,975
Yes or no? Binary outcome systems.

1171
02:20:10,305 --> 02:20:15,355
Logistic regression and. High scare.

1172
02:20:18,655 --> 02:20:26,614
Okay. Number ten association between daily number of death count and daily air pollution.

1173
02:20:26,615 --> 02:20:30,755
Concentration outcome is what is the characteristics of outcome.

1174
02:20:32,025 --> 02:20:37,635
Count on hustle.

1175
02:20:38,615 --> 02:20:49,945
When our committee count. You use parcel 11 and examine the relation between the fine particle temperature, relative humidity?

1176
02:20:50,365 --> 02:20:54,895
Which one is outcome? Which one is exposed? Do you know that? No.

1177
02:20:54,955 --> 02:20:59,604
There is no clear distinction between fine particle temperature, relative humidity,

1178
02:20:59,605 --> 02:21:02,995
even though maybe you can choose one in six what they one is outcome.

1179
02:21:03,385 --> 02:21:08,545
But let's say there is no you know which one is outcome in which one you exposure.

1180
02:21:08,755 --> 02:21:13,945
But you want to look at just relationship, those three continuous variable.

1181
02:21:14,425 --> 02:21:21,675
Which one do you. Three way ANOVA is there you are comparing mean.

1182
02:21:22,695 --> 02:21:28,875
Or the continuous outcome by category cur export accrual.

1183
02:21:29,145 --> 02:21:32,185
Right. So that's why we want.

1184
02:21:35,065 --> 02:21:38,915
Correlation. Okay. Okay.

1185
02:21:38,925 --> 02:21:45,285
1151 And so, uh, let's try, I want to finish this.

1186
02:21:46,605 --> 02:21:51,255
Um, we have a class right up to this.

1187
02:21:52,155 --> 02:21:57,015
I don't give five minute. I can finish this one. Let's continue this next next week.

1188
02:21:57,285 --> 02:22:04,425
Okay. Alright, so I will pause for my one today and then the homa one.

1189
02:22:04,425 --> 02:22:08,295
The other line is next three here. So this is for your homework.

1190
02:22:10,005 --> 02:22:13,955
So the data says so that's why I read that this one and then do descriptive.

1191
02:22:14,265 --> 02:22:16,565
Okay. All right. So I have a wonderful weekend and see you next week.
