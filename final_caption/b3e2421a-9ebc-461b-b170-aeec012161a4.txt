1
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:02,760
amondul: didn't Thank you.

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:16,049
amondul: even see I think I thought I did I thought about it, then I didn't do it norris okay um you did your job, I appreciate it good job okay any questions about anything.

3
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:18,870
amondul: Besides recording.

4
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:25,530
amondul: Right and make you guys saw and then bring up the chat so I can see if there's questions and chat.

5
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,330
amondul: make this big.

6
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:43,020
amondul: Normally, am there we go okay so we're going to talk about an overview of infectious disease today So these are just a worldwide statistics from who blew.

7
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:53,760
amondul: You start over again ooh la la Okay, these are some worldwide statistics from 2014 so pretty recently from the WHO, the World Health Organization.

8
00:00:54,420 --> 00:01:05,070
amondul: And so I think this is just a show you know, yesterday we talked about epidemiologic transition and how the causes of death, particularly in the US and other developing countries and really transitioned from.

9
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:08,640
amondul: More infectious causes to more chronic disease causes.

10
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:19,320
amondul: But that does not mean that infectious diseases do not remain an important public health problems so here you go tuberculosis it's caused by a bacteria mycobacterium tuberculosis.

11
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:31,680
amondul: causes one and a half million deaths per year and 9 million new cases per year worldwide malaria is a parasitic disease called caused by plasmodium else apart or plasmodium fedex.

12
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:44,130
amondul: It causes over half a million deaths a year and 198 million acute illnesses, importantly, there has been a 47% decrease in 2000 so that's great, but it remains a big problem.

13
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:53,700
amondul: And measles, is an example of a viral disease, I guess, we could also include put code here instead right, but you know.

14
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:01,260
amondul: Even as of 2013 140 5000 deaths and the global vaccination rate of 84% we you know we think about this.

15
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:07,740
amondul: As being not a problem in the US anymore, but we still do have pockets outbreaks of measles, where people are not vaccinating.

16
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:15,330
amondul: And then diarrheal diseases 4 billion cases a year and 2 million deaths and children less than five, so this is actually one of the.

17
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:24,570
amondul: leading causes of death in young kids worldwide, so you know, although in in this country and other developing countries.

18
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:32,250
amondul: are developed country, excuse me, these these are less of a public health problem or we think of them as being less of a health, public health problem than.

19
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:43,560
amondul: than chronic disease certainly they remain a very important worldwide public health problem, and of course we've all seen the code that is as an infectious disease has been important everywhere right.

20
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:58,080
amondul: All right, so I gave you examples of all three of these on the previous page but infectious diseases are caused by lots of different agents, one could be bacteria another as virus viruses and then also parasites.

21
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:03,960
amondul: And the parasites often have complicated life cycles involving several stages and several posts species.

22
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:19,680
amondul: viruses can be RNA or DNA viruses and they multiply by taking over the genetic machinery of the host cells and bacteria can be combated with antibiotics cell wall replication is the target of many biotics okay.

23
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:25,770
amondul: So let's talk a little bit about tempo and patterns of disease we touched on this yesterday.

24
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:32,910
amondul: There are endemic diseases, this is where the disease occurs at unexpected frequency in a given population.

25
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:47,010
amondul: You see this down here, so this is just a very simple graph with time going across the X axis and the number of cases of a disease on the y axis and endemic is the usual occurrence in whatever geographic area right the usual occurrence might differ based on.

26
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:54,600
amondul: Where you're talking about, but you know and sometimes it's it's, for example, seasonal like flu.

27
00:03:55,080 --> 00:04:08,730
amondul: And it goes up and down with the seasons, but this kind of variation would be sort of within the normal range endemic right epidemic is one disease occurs as greater than expected frequency in a given population, so this kind of can you guys all see my.

28
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,370
amondul: You can see the okay great.

29
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,380
amondul: You know what I know this thing.

30
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:18,510
amondul: that's the word i'm looking for words are tough today guys i'm so sorry.

31
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:27,330
amondul: So, if this is endemic, then this of course is much more than normal right, so this is in excess of normal, so this would be epidemic over here.

32
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:31,200
amondul: pandemic is of course an epidemic of worldwide proportions.

33
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:42,480
amondul: And then there's also sporadic which is sort of a single case or a cluster of cases right, and I think that's what people, for example, thought that the monkey pox outbreak was going to be right that it was just going to be sporadic.

34
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:50,490
amondul: But it has kind of not been that now we have Community transmission so it's becoming more of a dagger a pandemic potentially.

35
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:52,410
amondul: Okay.

36
00:04:54,930 --> 00:05:00,000
amondul: So examples of pandemics and potential pandemics HIV, AIDS cholera influenza.

37
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:16,740
amondul: coded right research and diseases So these are things that were under control and are kind of coming back yellow fever dengue fever TV is a resurgent disease right, so it was really under control, for a long time, but especially with.

38
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:27,000
amondul: Antibiotic resistance TB has researched diphtheria, and pertussis and then there's new infectious diseases right.

39
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:33,360
amondul: Like zeke a virus which we heard about a few years ago, before coven and of course code is infectious disease chicken dunia.

40
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:38,700
amondul: Ebola antibiotic resistance So these are.

41
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:46,800
amondul: new strains of bacteria right that are now resistant to antibiotics, Korea is one that is becoming a real public health problem, there are only.

42
00:05:47,070 --> 00:06:00,000
amondul: A couple of antibiotics that still work against a lot of gonorrhea that's out there, so people who are involved in antibiotic resistance work are all very nervous about that avian flu, and of course coppa right.

43
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:12,360
amondul: So how many people remember this from your reading the epidemiologic triad of disease so it's kind of a causal model that works really nicely for.

44
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:24,630
amondul: Infectious Diseases it doesn't hold as well with some chronic diseases, but you have a susceptible host an agent that can infect that post and an environment that supports the agent and the host coming together.

45
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:30,750
amondul: And sometimes this might happen with a vector and we'll talk about in factors and a little bit more detail in a few slides.

46
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:47,520
amondul: But so here's an example you have i'm going to make this small so that it's not taking up all the screen, but you have human papillomavirus or HPV, which is a virus that can cause cervical cancer, so what would be the epidemiological triad here right you've got.

47
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,200
amondul: Right you've got the host.

48
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,790
amondul: susceptible host you've got the agent.

49
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,720
amondul: And then you've got some environment that allows them to come together.

50
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,330
amondul: So what do you guys think.

51
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:11,970
amondul: what's the agent, first of all.

52
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,600
Divya Manohar: I see these the agent.

53
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:21,630
amondul: Baby yes that's exactly right HPV is the agent susceptible host so that would be somebody who has to.

54
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,640
amondul: Be that again.

55
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:25,560
Divya Manohar: The human being, or.

56
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:30,120
amondul: human being, yes, and in this case susceptible so they would be maybe not vaccinated right.

57
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:38,550
amondul: And then, what kind of environment, or you know what kind of environmental conditions that allow the agent to the host to come together.

58
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,860
Divya Manohar: immunocompromised or should.

59
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:45,030
amondul: It be or i'm thinking that's more of like a host.

60
00:07:48,600 --> 00:08:00,420
amondul: that's that's more of what makes the host more susceptible I suppose I would think you know these are sort of extrinsic things not intrinsic to the host or to the agent, but maybe unprotected sexual activity.

61
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:03,540
Divya Manohar: could be one.

62
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:07,020
Clifton Addison: would be the contact.

63
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:09,060
amondul: yeah.

64
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,340
amondul: contact.

65
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:17,580
amondul: Because the other things about the you know, maybe we're in a in a society where.

66
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:36,900
amondul: Not the condoms work particularly well for preventing HPV infection, but maybe it's you know, lack of that kind of barrier contraceptive protection is part of the Environment right if that weren't available that might allow for this kind of transmission to happen, for example.

67
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:40,860
amondul: Okay.

68
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:45,420
amondul: So that's an example of of that triad that we're talking about.

69
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:51,300
amondul: Oh no, I have to.

70
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:55,770
amondul: alright.

71
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:03,150
amondul: So content contact transmission oh sorry, these are modes of transmission.

72
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:14,580
amondul: So there's contact and vertical transmission so contact transmission can be direct or indirect and vertical transmission is happening between a mother and the baby.

73
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:21,810
amondul: Either during gestation via the placenta at delivery.

74
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:29,460
amondul: For post natively maybe by breastfeeding, for example, okay so vertical his mother to child.

75
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:43,650
amondul: Contact transmission is direct or indirect so direct contact occurs when the pathogen is transferred by contact from an infected person to another person without a contaminated intermediate object, so it could be touching sneezing sexual intercourse.

76
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:54,270
amondul: In direct contact involves the transfer of a pathogen by contact with the contaminated intermediate object or a vector so like a an inanimate object would be called a vehicle.

77
00:09:55,590 --> 00:10:04,320
amondul: It could be toys food, water, so like if it's a foodborne illness right that food would be the vehicle for indirect contact.

78
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:12,180
amondul: Toys you know anybody who's ever had a child in daycare everyone gets sick constantly because.

79
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:18,990
amondul: small children are disgusting and they get everything on the toys and then they'll share the toys and stick them in the mouth and then they'll get sick.

80
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:23,400
amondul: I can say they're just I have a child, so I can say that i'm allowed.

81
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:33,330
amondul: And then vector borne is where it's from an animal insect mosquito tip or mouse or something like that right.

82
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:36,240
Okay.

83
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:38,550
amondul: Any questions about that.

84
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:47,340
Divya Manohar: We would need to stick injuries fall into because you see direct contact, but without any contaminated intermediate object so.

85
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:55,440
amondul: I would think of Needlestick would be indirect right because the needle is is the vehicle okay.

86
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:57,330
amondul: Right.

87
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:13,590
amondul: Okay, so this is a lovely picture, all of us, enjoying our masks here make that a little tighter Okay, so is this indirect or direct transmission.

88
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:23,460
amondul: That would be direct yeah that's an aerosol or a or a droplet transmission, so we would breathe that in.

89
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:32,730
amondul: super super great there alright malaria, we talked about a little bit earlier major public health issue right.

90
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:44,160
amondul: In fact, over 300 million individuals worldwide and results in over a million deaths globally, so why is it so difficult difficult to control, and would you call this direct or indirect transmission.

91
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:52,080
amondul: yep the teacher says indirect, that is correct, what kind of indirect is that a vehicle or a vector.

92
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:55,800
amondul: vector it's this little guy right here.

93
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:07,650
amondul: um so that's why it is so difficult to control right because you have to control the vector and has anybody who's ever tried to control the speedos in their own yard.

94
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:16,200
amondul: knows that that's extremely difficult to do right so mosquitoes are almost impossible to truly control completely.

95
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,460
amondul: So that's that's why this remains a very big problem.

96
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:29,340
amondul: Alright, any questions before we move on to talking about clinical versus non clinical disease.

97
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:33,390
amondul: alright.

98
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:47,280
amondul: So clinical diseases characterized by signs and symptoms right but non clinical disease can be in sort of a bunch of different categories, where you can have a preclinical which means it's not yet clinically apparent, but it will be.

99
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:57,180
amondul: subclinical, which is where it's not clinically apparent and it won't become clinically apparent right So these are people who just always remain symptom free but maybe have the disease or a carrier.

100
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,540
amondul: Persistent or chronic is where the person carries the infection long after it was thought to have been resolved.

101
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:15,780
amondul: Or it can be latent an infection with no active replication so viral nucleic acid, for example, hi and then in the nucleus of the cell right, so you could have a viral infection that's latent and then it might might start up again later.

102
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:23,220
amondul: So we can illustrate this idea, as the iceberg concept right, so we know that iceberg.

103
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:39,090
amondul: are much larger beneath the water than what actually sticks out right, so the clinical disease is kind of what you can see, above the waterline that's when you can see, of the iceberg, but there's all this subclinical disease going on, you cannot see because it has no sometimes incentives.

104
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:48,630
amondul: And this is a little bit more detailed drawing of that, but you know if this is the water line you have above it, you have.

105
00:13:50,100 --> 00:14:01,590
amondul: kind of a pyramid of disease right you've got moderate or mild disease, you have sort of classical and severe and then there's disease that can even lead to death, and all of this would have signs and symptoms but of like varying severity.

106
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:10,860
amondul: But then you can also have under here, these are some clinical cases, you can have infection without clinical their illness or maybe even exposure without infection.

107
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,020
amondul: Okay.

108
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:16,830
amondul: So.

109
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:31,620
amondul: there's a little bit of definitions that we need to go through a little bit of vocabulary and we've got infectivity pathogenicity and virulence of all of these are characteristics of the agent okay.

110
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:47,100
amondul: So infectivity is the ability of the agent to multiply invade and establish infection so basically the way you calculate infectivity is the number of effect infected divided by the number of exposed right.

111
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:54,660
amondul: So, if this is fire if, like everybody who's exposed becomes infected infectivity is 100% right.

112
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:59,040
amondul: Because the proportion of people exposed to will actually become infected.

113
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,020
amondul: That makes sense.

114
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:16,470
amondul: Then you have pathogenicity right, so this is the ability to produce a clinical illness, so this is the number of clinically ill divided by the number infected it's sort of like the iceberg, we can see compared to the whole iceberg right.

115
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:18,720
amondul: Almost.

116
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:29,370
amondul: And then virulence is the ability to cause serious illness or death so it's the number of severe cases cases divided by the number of clinically ill.

117
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:31,770
amondul: kind of a more.

118
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:43,230
amondul: Case fatality rate is sort of a kind of ireland's measure right so it's the number of deaths about about the number of politically oh.

119
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,310
amondul: it's like an extreme measure right.

120
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:51,240
amondul: So if you're a girl and in case fatality rate are sort of related.

121
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:54,000
Okay.

122
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:58,500
amondul: So.

123
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,200
amondul: If we think about various.

124
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:18,180
amondul: agents that we know of, and if we think about infectivity packages pathogenicity and virulence you know we've got smallpox which is high, for all of them right it's very effective a lot almost you know a lot of people, I suppose we'll get it a lot of people who.

125
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:24,090
amondul: are affected will have clinical illness and i'll have severe illness right.

126
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:39,090
amondul: measles, on the other hand, is very ineffective has high activity high pathogenicity but low virulence right, so a lot of people will have sort of mild or moderate illness with with with measles.

127
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:56,430
amondul: here's an example for let's look, for example at tuberculosis very low infectivity and pathogenicity right, so a lot of people will have subclinical infections, with a lot of people will be exposed but not actually get it, but if you if you get it you're likely to have severe illness.

128
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,120
amondul: That makes sense.

129
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:20,700
amondul: here's another kind of way of looking at that let's think about polio, so this is the pie chart of all the cases of polio 90 to 95% are subclinical, meaning that they they have the virus, but they don't produce symptoms.

130
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:27,810
amondul: Of those that are clinical, this is the little piece that's clinical here the red green and purple.

131
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:30,990
amondul: The purple is the.

132
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:38,730
amondul: part the portion to get the paralytic polio right and that's what everybody thinks of when they think of polio between two people and iron long was in all of that.

133
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:48,420
amondul: there's also non paralytic and minor right, so you can have kind of minor dizzy is your non paralytic polio, but this this little sliver is what we really think about what we think polio.

134
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:54,810
amondul: notice the thing about West Nile again about 80% are subclinical.

135
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:06,600
amondul: Of those that are clinical 20% excuse me up all of those 20% will be clinical and less than 1% are going to get that really severe disease.

136
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:09,180
amondul: That makes sense.

137
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:11,400
Okay.

138
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:13,350
amondul: So.

139
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:26,160
amondul: We can also think about incubation period and layton periods so let's think about this is disease, and this is infectiousness Okay, so this is when you actually are getting getting symptoms and getting the disease yourself so you're susceptible.

140
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:34,350
amondul: Infection occurs here there's some incubation period during which the disease is subclinical but then symptoms appear and it becomes clinical.

141
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:43,860
amondul: Then you have your sympathetic period, and then it is resolved right and the resolution can be a bunch of different things right, you can either become immune.

142
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:51,720
amondul: You recover your now carrier, for he died of your disease right, so you can resolve and lots of different ways.

143
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,840
amondul: All right, infectious.

144
00:18:56,190 --> 00:19:07,350
amondul: Is a little bit different right you're susceptible you become infected then there's some latency period before which you can't transmit it to someone else but then you become the infection becomes transmissible.

145
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:13,080
amondul: This is your infectious period and then your infection is not transmissible.

146
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:31,350
amondul: Okay, this could happen without a symptomatic period right, but in this case we're kind of lining them up with one another, so there is this period here during which the infection is transmissible, but there are no symptoms, in this particular case right.

147
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:39,630
amondul: it's all it's in it's completely under the radar here right this person has infected.

148
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:45,630
amondul: And doesn't have any symptoms at all during this period, part of which they can actually transmit it right.

149
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:59,640
amondul: So this incubation period can really range for a lot of different infections right you've got influenza it's quite short cold is quite short.

150
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:07,260
amondul: You know here it's showing started showing the possible range and white, and then the most common range and black right.

151
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:13,650
amondul: But you know this is keep in mind this is in days rabies is you know quite long and.

152
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:26,040
amondul: hepatitis B they're showing it to us, you know they put this little break here because it's 80 to 100 days for hepatitis B can anybody think of something where the incubation period can actually be even longer.

153
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:33,270
amondul: You know that incubation period being the time between infection and appearance of symptoms appearance of symptoms.

154
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:42,120
Nolaundron Harris: Media gonorrhea syphilis.

155
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,600
amondul: All of those HIV for sure.

156
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:55,590
amondul: Right, which is part of what made HIV such a problem shingles absolutely yeah because shingles is actually shingles was really interesting right because you had to have.

157
00:20:56,610 --> 00:21:07,440
amondul: gotten the chicken pox virus as a kid right, and then it becomes latent for a long, long time and then it kind of wakes up again, for whatever reason, and decides to make you miserable once more.

158
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:09,870
amondul: shingles is a good one.

159
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:24,870
amondul: HIV is a really good one, I think, to right which makes, which is part of what made it such a problem when it first appeared, because people were infectious but asymptomatic for so long.

160
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:27,750
amondul: Years even right.

161
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,960
amondul: yeah, so this is a.

162
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:38,640
amondul: The incubation period, you know is very important in terms of how you combat an infection.

163
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:39,930
amondul: Okay.

164
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:48,660
amondul: Alright, so this is sort of leading into our exercise for today so imagine that you're the CEO of the hospital with this outbreak.

165
00:21:49,500 --> 00:22:01,260
amondul: you've got patients with acute gastroenteritis you know this is patients in your hospital so they've got diarrhea and vomiting this is causing dehydration and it's disproportionately affecting the very old and the very young.

166
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:08,910
amondul: And every 24 to 48 hours, there appears to be a new wave, so this is giving you some hint about the incubation period of this right.

167
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:19,230
amondul: The illness last for 12 to 16 hours, it seems to be highly contagious from the moment the person is l for at least three days so.

168
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:30,780
amondul: In order to deal with this outbreak, you need to know what is the infectious agent how it's transmitted and that will help you decide how you can prevent it right kind of need to know these first two things before you can figure out how to prevent it.

169
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:34,260
amondul: So.

170
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:46,380
amondul: you've got a bunch of already sick people right you're in a hospital So how do you track down cases, so you need a case definition, so this is part of what you're going to be doing, and your exercise is coming up with case definition.

171
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:54,390
amondul: So, but there's probably people who don't have this disease, who have diarrhea and vomiting in your hospital right.

172
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:56,160
amondul: So.

173
00:22:57,270 --> 00:23:03,030
amondul: How would you, you know you want to make sure that reported cases actually a case not a misdiagnosis.

174
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:11,040
amondul: And you want all the most of these cases, you know, do they have the same infection does this tenant of diagnosis apply to suspect cases.

175
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:19,290
amondul: So you might start by describing the physical symptoms right the case it illness is defined as any diarrhea vomiting abdominal cramps headache or a fever.

176
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:34,050
amondul: Okay, so this is saying, or like any of these things doesn't have to be all of them, so this is assuming this does not assume that all cases will have the same symptoms it's also not talking about any risk factors for illness right.

177
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:50,310
amondul: A case definition could include risk factors right, you might refine your definition once you figure out kind of where things are coming from so cases defined as diarrhea vomiting with onset within 96 hours of consuming food served by the hospital cafeteria oh.

178
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:58,830
amondul: So now, this would exclude unrelated cases of gastroenteritis or other illnesses right.

179
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:06,270
amondul: yeah josh For this reason I don't study foodborne illness.

180
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:19,890
amondul: I did take a foodborne illness class my mph degree, and then I didn't like want to eat out ever but that only lasted for a short while, and then by that then you're like whatever it's probably fine I never got sick before i'll go to this gross food truck.

181
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:36,690
amondul: Okay, so this is this is, you know you might start with one case definition, you might refine it after you learn more, and so what you're really trying to do is to get at cases that are associated with this particular outbreak right that's kind of the the the goal of a case definition.

182
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:46,320
amondul: Alright, so you have to think carefully when you're defining a case you're probably never going to get it perfect you're always going to kind of.

183
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:56,430
amondul: run the risk of either over or under reporting and you kind of have to think through what the consequences of that are right so let's think about HIV, for example.

184
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:59,520
amondul: You could define a case as people.

185
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:16,620
amondul: Or, this could be, I guess, this is for AIDS right, so you could define a case of AIDS is someone who has HIV associated opportunistic infection, or you could define it as somebody who has the seed for countless than 200 micro leaders, based on a lab test.

186
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:23,550
amondul: presuming everybody who needed wanting to get a lab test which of these is going to catch more cases.

187
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:36,930
Will Brodwater: Last workout.

188
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:45,630
amondul: The CD for count is going to catch more of your cases right because you might have people who have a low city for account but aren't Chelsea also got it Thank you.

189
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:55,110
amondul: You might have people to Lucy for camp you don't yet have an opportunistic infection right so you're going to catch more cases with this than you are with just looking at the port of opportunistic infections.

190
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,690
amondul: or people some some people might get one and I don't know if early on, maybe wouldn't.

191
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:06,900
amondul: Put two and two together and kind of figure out, you may not go to the hospital for everything I would assume right, so this is going to catch more people.

192
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:15,270
amondul: And then you have to think about it, what are the consequences of over reporting, what are the consequences of under reporting and I think, in this case.

193
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:28,170
amondul: Under reporting is very bad right because people could spread it to somebody else without knowing that they have it, or they could become very ill they might need they need medicine, you know what I mean, so I think you have to think carefully about.

194
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:35,970
amondul: You know, there might be some cases in which over reporting would be really bad you don't want to you don't necessarily want to catch every single case of everything, because.

195
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:44,460
amondul: It just might overburden the health system or something like that right, so you might only want like really bad cases or that kind of thing right, so you have to think carefully about.

196
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:57,780
amondul: Or you might you know if you're trying to find the source of an outbreak, if you over report if you if your case definition includes too many people who are really associated with your outbreak, it might make it really hard to figure out.

197
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:01,320
amondul: That it's the hospital cafeteria is making me sick right.

198
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:07,890
amondul: So you have to kind of think about you might want very stringent case definition in some cases, or you might want.

199
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:13,140
amondul: A more relaxed case definition or a more inclusive case definition.

200
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:25,290
amondul: To try to make sure you get everybody and you really have to try to determine what your goals are and what the consequences are of kind of getting missing people are including people who maybe shouldn't have included.

201
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:27,420
amondul: That makes sense.

202
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:31,950
amondul: it's not a one size fits all it's not like there's always one right answer.

203
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:39,300
amondul: Alright, so this is an example of an epidemic curve.

204
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:46,920
amondul: It is essentially a histogram and you're going to make one of these today in your exercise this is extremely important.

205
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:51,330
amondul: for helping to understand kind of be.

206
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:58,470
amondul: You know, an outbreak, as it happens, right, so you have the number of cases on the y axis.

207
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:07,470
amondul: And then time on the X axis and, in this case it's in days right it depends on what disease you're talking about the latency period what your scale of time might be.

208
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:17,070
amondul: On in this case, they actually have broken out probable in confirmed cases so they're kind of showing you to case definitions here, which is.

209
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:26,490
amondul: cool way of doing it right so and then they've they've shown on here kind of important time points right, so this they think is the first case.

210
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:31,380
amondul: index case they knew the first one that was reported to them.

211
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:41,580
amondul: enhanced surveillance happened here control measures were introduced here and then you've got your last case because their control measures, apparently worked.

212
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:44,010
amondul: That makes sense.

213
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:56,040
amondul: I think it's also important to know that many deadly infectious diseases used to be endemic to the US, and they are anymore right.

214
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:10,890
amondul: So in 1900 only 40 states have health departments, the first continuous neatest will use of chlorine in the water started here like around 1910 we have the big influenza pandemic of 1918.

215
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:16,230
amondul: Here in the early 1920s, we have the last human to human transmission of play.

216
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:23,250
amondul: Very important in the early 1940s, we have the first use of penicillin.

217
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:32,130
amondul: Here in 1950 early 1950s, we have the salt vaccine what was that for you guys know.

218
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:51,780
amondul: polio that's right, this is the polio vaccine the passage of the vaccination assistance act here, making vaccines much more accessible and so you can see kind of the the per 100,000 per population.

219
00:29:53,280 --> 00:30:01,140
amondul: per 1000 100,000 population per year death rate for infectious disease really comes down over time.

220
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:06,630
amondul: So now, this history is important.

221
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:18,060
amondul: Alright, so vaccination has been an important tool in reducing infectious disease right.

222
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:26,400
amondul: So we have an antigen which is alive or inactivated substance, so it could be a protein or poly sack right which is part of the agent.

223
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:36,150
amondul: That is capable of producing an immune response, the immune system as a cellular and molecular system designed to distinguish yourself from non self and protect from non cell.

224
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:38,940
amondul: Like infectious diseases and other things right.

225
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:51,030
amondul: So the immune system is going to recognize them target specific pathogens or foreign substance and it has a memory, so the capability to store information from past exposures, so that it can respond more quickly to later invasions by the same pathogen.

226
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:56,100
amondul: protects the entire body, so the resulting in media is not limited to the site of infection.

227
00:30:57,330 --> 00:31:04,680
amondul: So that seems to reduce reduce disease burden through two mechanisms which we've all heard too much about this, the second bullet point in the past few years.

228
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:19,770
amondul: By immunizing individuals right and providing individual protection for those who are in the United but also creating herd immunity it stops the spread of disease in a Community this really only works for some things it's not working very well for coven.

229
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:30,090
amondul: Often 90% of people have to be muted immunized for her going to be to work, it also has to actually protect against infection niches disease.

230
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:39,210
amondul: We have current outbreaks of measles whooping cough etc, which are occurring an unvaccinated children and people who are anti backs and she's not vaccinated children.

231
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:51,150
amondul: So we have a lot of diseases that are controlled by immunization that these classic examples here we have lots of vaccines that are in development, but have not actually happened yet.

232
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:57,900
amondul: We have newer vaccines chickenpox of HPV and also of course kogut right.

233
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,010
amondul: So.

234
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:08,910
amondul: The father of vaccination were Jenner.

235
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:18,510
amondul: His observation was that milkmaids the past cowpox had no plaque scars, meaning that they did not get smallpox.

236
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:33,240
amondul: And 70 1796 he used cowpox fluid postural from Sarah gnomes to inoculate eight year old James fits the a two half inch arm incisions and six weeks later he exposed the child of smallpox the variation and got no reaction.

237
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:47,220
amondul: I suspect strongly that this would not pass IRB these days, this is not a very ethical way to do this, but it was a straightforward and prove this point, thankfully, or else.

238
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:52,020
amondul: Poor James eight years old, good grief.

239
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:56,250
amondul: would not have a third so well but.

240
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:01,980
amondul: Apparently it's a but he was correct right, so this is kind of where we get the smallpox vaccine from.

241
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:13,410
amondul: smallpox is moderately contagious transmitted through saliva or by direct contact with the lesions on the skin people that the costs are most infectious, this is a picture of someone who's suffering from smallpox.

242
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:19,950
amondul: it's it's really awful I mean I think most of us today don't really recognize how terrible the disease, this was.

243
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:30,600
amondul: You know, we think about chickenpox that many of us some of you are too young to have chicken pox because you probably got the vaccine I had chicken pox that was no fun, but it was not this right.

244
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:43,920
amondul: So I think a lot of us don't don't really internalize kind of how terrible this was with a lot of those diseases right that aren't around anymore, because we were vaccinated against them like we hear about them and we don't recognize necessarily how awful they were.

245
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:53,370
amondul: But smallpox has been eradicated, the last recorded wild case of smallpox was this gentleman and occurred in October of 1977.

246
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:58,410
amondul: So this is a major vaccination success in the world.

247
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:04,470
amondul: Any questions before we move on to talking about outbreak investigations.

248
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:14,160
amondul: Alright, so outbreak epidemiology is interesting it's it's often but not always infectious right so here's an example.

249
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:24,180
amondul: Where it wasn't infectious a Michigan supermarket worker was charged with intentionally contaminated contaminating 200 pounds of meat, with a nicotine containing insecticide in 2002.

250
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:32,940
amondul: So that was great so basically outbreak epidemiology is just techniques to investigate rapidly evolving public health situations.

251
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:41,580
amondul: So who conducts an outbreak investigation whoa, no, no, please, no, thank you.

252
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:43,260
amondul: No.

253
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:54,000
amondul: Okay, whatever so we kind of depends on jurisdictions right could be local state or federal public health authorities and the source of the outbreak is it food drug environmental contaminants right.

254
00:34:54,660 --> 00:35:03,930
amondul: could be State Department of Health CDC could be the FDA or the EPA could involve the local police state, police and FBI which i'm sure the aforementioned example with the.

255
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:10,110
amondul: You know, on purpose contamination of food involved one of those people.

256
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:20,160
amondul: um so there's basically eight steps of an outbreak in this investigation prepare for field work you have to establish the existence of an outbreak, to begin with right.

257
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:26,310
amondul: define and identify cases, then you will describe the orient the data in terms of person place in time.

258
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:38,160
amondul: called this will help you develop hypotheses about what might be causing the outbreak and then he would evaluate those right, you are going to implement control and prevention measures and communicate your findings to the public.

259
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:45,510
amondul: So here is an example from the Arizona Department of Health services, this is like their little.

260
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:59,250
amondul: checkboxes for what you would include in your in your outbreak when you're preparing to go on your investigation I think some of this is quite funny I think there's a palm pilot don't forget your palm pilot everybody.

261
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:07,020
amondul: You know, we could maybe this is a bit old maybe the palm pilot and small flashlight could be could be your iPhone now right.

262
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:13,710
amondul: But you know they have all of these different things on here that you might include for.

263
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:21,570
amondul: Probably don't need any computer discs or your digital camera we just just your phone attached to phone.

264
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:38,790
amondul: step to establish the existence of an outbreak so in order to establish there's an outbreak need to know our cases in excess of expected baseline rates for this disease and set it.

265
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:45,450
amondul: So you're going to need to know what data sources are available to know what the endemic rate of this is right.

266
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:58,860
amondul: You might need health department surveillance records for notifiable diseases might need some hospital discharge records or some mortality records if they don't have it for that exact place that you're in you might get data from the neighboring state or neighboring.

267
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,080
amondul: neighboring.

268
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:06,180
amondul: Even a neighboring country right if you're in a developing setting.

269
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:10,170
amondul: So.

270
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:19,530
amondul: Then you want to figure out is the reporting case actually a case of the disease or a misdiagnosis you want lab results if you can get them right, you might talk with clinicians.

271
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:30,690
amondul: And then you've got all of the suspect cases then you're trying to figure out to they all have the same infection, or like similar infections right is the tentative diagnosis applied to suspect cases.

272
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:37,260
amondul: In order to do all this you're going to have to do that case definition right and so that's something you're going to grapple with in your exercise.

273
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:45,510
amondul: you're going to start tracking down, who, what, where, when you can use questionnaires, maybe credit card tracking right to figure out where did they eat Where do they shop.

274
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:59,340
amondul: Where have they been you might use grocery store distribution that should be says door, not a grocery story distribution networks and then you know kind of wherever you think you're going to find effective people you're going to get go try to figure this out.

275
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:06,060
amondul: you're going to describe and orient your data in terms of person place in time you're going to make that epidemic curve right.

276
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:10,830
amondul: histogram the graph of the number of cases on this by the date of onset.

277
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:24,570
amondul: This gives you some idea of the pattern of spread the magnitude time trends outliers period of exposure can help you figure out the incubation period, you know if you have multiple waves, you know, maybe you have more than one exposure moment.

278
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:33,120
amondul: kind of like in the case we talked about earlier, the hospital cafeteria right every few days you were getting another wave of cases, so they were.

279
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:42,300
amondul: New people were getting exposed on a repeated basis right it wasn't just one exposure one epidemic and then it went away right so epidemic curves can be really helpful.

280
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:49,680
amondul: here's another example right smallpox cases in May of 1972.

281
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:56,520
amondul: The index case travels in Iraq, the date of onset of index case then you've got this.

282
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:01,770
amondul: epidemic of 20 something or more cases that happened after that.

283
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:13,470
amondul: So you're going to develop hypotheses determine the risk factors for disease is it food handling animal animal handling water contamination air contamination person to person transitions here they figured out.

284
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:26,220
amondul: At some point that's why this is on your academic curve that figured out to this person traveled to Iraq and probably got it there right, so you know travel person person transmission from somebody traveling to an endemic area coming back.

285
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:37,680
amondul: And then you're going to evaluate your hypothesis, and this is something you're going to do today, so this is you're going to calculate the specific attack rates for different foods Okay, so what is the attack rate.

286
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:45,060
amondul: Is the percentage of people who became ill who ate that food right so you've got, for example, for big town.

287
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,690
amondul: You have a total of 46 people.

288
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:51,510
amondul: Who ate baked ham.

289
00:39:53,160 --> 00:40:04,320
amondul: 29 of them became ill so 63% 29 divided by 46 gives you 63% that's the attack rate for baked ham, the proportion of people who ate baked ham, who became ill.

290
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:22,410
amondul: You also want to calculate the attack rate and people who did not eat the item right, so in this case 29 people didn't eat baked town 59% of them still became ill so which of these items has the highest food specific attack right here.

291
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:25,050
Geehan Suleyman: ice cream.

292
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:29,130
amondul: ice cream exactly and then really importantly.

293
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:44,580
amondul: The attack rate is super low and people who didn't eat the ice cream right, so this kind of makes you think Ah yes, if you ate guys from you got sick if you didn't eat the ice cream you didn't get sick, basically, what about these three people I don't know, maybe they're lying to you.

294
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:49,170
amondul: Maybe they ate ice cream and they don't want to admit that they cheated on a diet or.

295
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:58,530
amondul: Maybe they just had a little spoonful of ice cream from someone else's plate, or they were you know scooping ice cream they like to their thing I don't know, do you know what I mean like so you're always going to have.

296
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:03,630
amondul: People who don't answer truthfully or don't answer correctly, for whatever reason.

297
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:07,680
amondul: But yes, so this makes it look like.

298
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:14,730
amondul: The ice cream is the culprit here, because the attack rate is fly and people who did it and lo and people who did not.

299
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:25,800
amondul: Right, if you look, for example, back at the baked ham, it looks like the attack rate is about the same people who did and did not eat it right, which means that they all probably ate ice cream right.

300
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:36,480
amondul: The people who ate a baked ham and didn't eat debate him or the people who gave you guys the you know the 63% of people who ate the bay tam about cigar people, maybe ice cream right.

301
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:49,530
amondul: All right, you might conduct environmental studies right, so you know if it's if you think it's food, you might try to get a sample of the food and test it.

302
00:41:51,270 --> 00:42:02,790
amondul: You might need an environmental specialist you going to do an inspection review practices and procedures might evaluate and collect information from staff you look at violations of food, you know food preparation handwashing.

303
00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:06,930
amondul: You might try to replicate processing or procedures, to see if you can kind of get the.

304
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:10,560
amondul: create the problem again right.

305
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:18,030
amondul: And then you're going to implement control measures right, so you know with that washing hands.

306
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:21,420
amondul: Anybody know what this one's about.

307
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:38,310
amondul: it's like a cruise ship outbreak of norovirus right so like norovirus happens a lot in like closed environments that cruise ship so apparently you should not use restrooms for monitoring, if you have a virus ownership.

308
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:50,220
amondul: that's a very upsetting sign mentioned being on vacation and being like i'm going to party on this note nevermind we're all just going to vomit over the rail together good times.

309
00:42:52,290 --> 00:42:57,150
amondul: And then you want to communicate your findings right outbreak investigations are always public events.

310
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:10,500
amondul: You know you have to alert expose people advise the public of measures that are being taken to identify the cause and control the outbreak, you have to explain the risk of exposure to the public and explain where new policies are needed.

311
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:17,940
amondul: there's always social, political consequences of outbreaks as we've all been living for the past few years.

312
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:27,360
amondul: You know panic is rare when individuals are well informed, so people need to have trust in the authorities and so informing the public is very important.

313
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:38,160
amondul: You want to announce things early to prevent this information and rumors you want to be transparent, you want to be candid factual and accessible and public concern should be brought into decision making.

314
00:43:42,570 --> 00:43:43,710
amondul: Any questions.

315
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:54,540
amondul: Okay.

316
00:43:57,450 --> 00:44:09,060
amondul: In that case, we're going to go ahead and take a 10 minute break so we're going to come back at like 3227 to 30 and then we will get into our groups, and we will.

317
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:20,670
amondul: begin working on today's exercise okay so we'll work on the exercise and then we'll come back together as a group to discuss the answers okay.

318
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:25,260
amondul: Alright, see you in about 10 minutes.

319
00:44:26,970 --> 00:44:28,080
amondul: Right everybody.

320
00:44:28,650 --> 00:44:28,920
Brenda Jenkins: This.

321
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:30,300
is being recorded.

322
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:37,740
amondul: Okay, we need folks in the room to mute and actually if everybody can mute that would be helpful.

323
00:44:44,070 --> 00:44:45,270
amondul: Thanks guys.

324
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:50,220
amondul: Alright, welcome back everybody.

325
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:59,130
amondul: I thought we would start and maybe just go kind of group by group and let people answer some of the questions so um.

326
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:03,060
amondul: let's see i'm going to share my screen.

327
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:13,560
amondul: Alright, so let's start with.

328
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:27,270
amondul: A group service number at this time, which is making me a little confused for a second give me a second here um let's do in person group one, so what questions, did you guys list that you would ask Mrs Smith.

329
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:34,830
amondul: recently asked is.

330
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:49,920
amondul: This third party, what was the food and the drink cater to purchase of homemade what ingredients reviews, because some ingredients can trigger allergies like very nuts, etc.

331
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:56,910
amondul: If me was serve what kind of condition was a raw or cooked and Morgan state he rare.

332
00:45:58,710 --> 00:46:04,020
amondul: What muscles rivers of water for their bed, how many English food was there per serving people eight.

333
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:08,880
amondul: house soon after the party did people report sickness and what's.

334
00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:11,460
amondul: Great.

335
00:46:12,510 --> 00:46:13,140
amondul: um.

336
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:18,480
amondul: anybody else have anything else that they wanted to add about what questions you would ask.

337
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:24,510
amondul: These are the things that I had listed, which is pretty much what you guys said, I think.

338
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:35,160
amondul: Alright, so basically you just want to find out about Obama served, and you know how long people have been second all that kind of stuff.

339
00:46:36,270 --> 00:46:42,600
amondul: Alright, so the menu for the dinner can just consisted of roasted chicken coconut custard plies gravy made from the chicken.

340
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:50,670
amondul: potatoes beans milk soda and biscuits, so this is also tells you the one group of guests arrived after the first serving in the meal.

341
00:46:51,300 --> 00:47:02,160
amondul: Because they had been to another party and that these guys for service second sitting of the same deal and then you go into the field to collect data, so what kind of information, do you collect from the guests, so how about in person group to.

342
00:47:08,190 --> 00:47:11,040
amondul: Sorry, I was just saying I was trying to.

343
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:14,760
amondul: Think, who was in that group go ahead, please sorry.

344
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:29,490
Nolaundron Harris: We were we were thinking about asking my questions i'm good party what items did they eat at the party.

345
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:37,320
Nolaundron Harris: Which did they participate in the first, second or both meal servings.

346
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:41,430
Nolaundron Harris: If there's something else I left out.

347
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:50,970
amondul: Maybe when they became ill what were their symptoms.

348
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:55,710
amondul: anybody else have anything to add.

349
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:04,470
amondul: All right, alright yeah great job that's right.

350
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,570
amondul: Alright, so here's a table of symptoms and.

351
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:16,350
amondul: reported by the guests who identify themselves as ill and so, then the question is, what are you going to include in your case definition.

352
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:27,090
amondul: And remember, you know if you include a lot of sometimes you're going to end up, including you know, maybe over counting if you only include a couple you might end up undercounting so.

353
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:32,790
amondul: You know what do you guys think what did you let's do a virtual group to.

354
00:48:36,870 --> 00:48:38,490
amondul: Oh, that was in person to I thought.

355
00:48:44,670 --> 00:48:49,290
amondul: Okay, what group should I go to now three okay virtual three.

356
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:58,800
Mostafa Fakhruldin: So we included vomiting diarrhea fever and.

357
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:01,470
Mostafa Fakhruldin: And headache.

358
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,040
amondul: yeah all of those or just one no.

359
00:49:05,070 --> 00:49:12,960
Mostafa Fakhruldin: So diarrhea and vomiting fever and a headache oh so um we remove sore throat just because it was.

360
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,290
Mostafa Fakhruldin: was too small, of a.

361
00:49:17,490 --> 00:49:35,160
Mostafa Fakhruldin: indication to show that it was related towards the food or the party and every made a good point like sometimes when people vomit they could have sore throat, so it can be from the symptom rather than from the food so we're just focused on the things now our show the highest frequency.

362
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:43,950
Mostafa Fakhruldin: And instead of over reporting it putting diarrhea independently vomiting independently as well we just combine the.

363
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:49,230
amondul: The city has to have all all fours what you're saying okay.

364
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,620
amondul: Did any other group do something different.

365
00:49:57,420 --> 00:50:01,680
Geehan Suleyman: I don't think they had, I mean we said they could have nausea vomiting.

366
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:04,380
Geehan Suleyman: diarrhea or.

367
00:50:05,430 --> 00:50:11,400
Geehan Suleyman: You know diarrhea and vomiting fever hey well it doesn't have to be like I included all the symptoms but they don't have.

368
00:50:13,590 --> 00:50:15,330
amondul: They had to have any one of them.

369
00:50:16,770 --> 00:50:17,070
Geehan Suleyman: Yes.

370
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:21,420
amondul: So you guys are gonna you know include more people right as a case.

371
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:24,900
amondul: And so you know could be.

372
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:35,850
amondul: That you, you know if you if you include more sometimes it might be too broad, so you might have people who are not really sick with your disease that you're including.

373
00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:47,400
amondul: But again, if you, you know if you include too few years and i've kept some cases, so you know you have to think about what the consequences of that again there's no really perfect answer to this and it's a really hard thing to do right so.

374
00:50:47,850 --> 00:50:57,300
amondul: This was meant to kind of make you guys grapple with this and realize that you know any two groups of people who come up with a different definition may come up with a different one right and it's it's.

375
00:50:58,350 --> 00:51:01,380
amondul: it's not a right wrong black and white kind of answer.

376
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:10,560
amondul: All right, and so, then we were going to come up with this epidemic curve, everyone should look something like this.

377
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:23,700
amondul: Your labels might have had ranges like zero to two two to four etc, but it should look something more or less like this and, again, you know, using excel was supposed to be a tool to help you if that's something that.

378
00:51:24,990 --> 00:51:30,300
amondul: helps you do this, you don't have to do in an excel you could have just sketched it out, that would have been fine too.

379
00:51:31,470 --> 00:51:40,770
amondul: But it should look something like that, and then you were asked what the median incubation period was for the illness and what was their range, so I guess virtual for.

380
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:44,010
amondul: Virtual group for.

381
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:49,980
Geehan Suleyman: josh, you have the numbers.

382
00:51:50,790 --> 00:51:54,240
Joshua Tucker: yeah sorry I had to get off for a second just pulling it back up.

383
00:52:02,550 --> 00:52:05,070
Joshua Tucker: Can you repeat your question, one more time, Dr monitor.

384
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:07,080
amondul: By what was the median incubation.

385
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:08,490
amondul: period range.

386
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:13,080
Joshua Tucker: cool, so the median was just under 26 hours.

387
00:52:14,550 --> 00:52:18,150
Joshua Tucker: In the range was 11 to 36 the IQ or was 20 to 30.

388
00:52:18,870 --> 00:52:22,350
amondul: medium is 25.75 range 1136.

389
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:23,820
Geehan Suleyman: that's what we had.

390
00:52:24,990 --> 00:52:28,260
amondul: Great anybody gets something different or confused about any of that.

391
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:35,520
amondul: alright.

392
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:43,470
amondul: So then, you were asked is there appear to be secondary transmission, and this is something that was discussed in the reading and a little bit more detail.

393
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:52,020
amondul: And I think I briefly mentioned in the lecture like what would you expect to see what you would you expect your epidemic curve to look like, if you had secondary transmission.

394
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,320
amondul: What group are we on that bias.

395
00:52:57,870 --> 00:53:02,430
amondul: Of the akron group so you guys tell me what, what do you think the curve would look like.

396
00:53:03,630 --> 00:53:05,970
amondul: If we had secondary transmission.

397
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:15,900
Sarah Ferri: So if we have a secondary transmission, we would potentially see an additional curve.

398
00:53:16,290 --> 00:53:17,070
noting that.

399
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:34,980
Sarah Ferri: Exactly, knowing that potentially when you have a secondary infection it's the secondary group is infected from the primary infection so it's that the people from the party potentially infected people kind of outside the party.

400
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,280
Sarah Ferri: As like as a small example.

401
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:42,720
amondul: Now this right, so do you think we have secondary transmission.

402
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:43,740
know.

403
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:52,200
Sarah Ferri: The people infected we're pretty much limited to those of the party and the histogram that were.

404
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:56,220
Sarah Ferri: developed here is a pretty typical normal gram.

405
00:53:56,610 --> 00:54:00,990
amondul: yeah it's kind of one one bump right yep okay great.

406
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:14,820
amondul: Alright, so symptoms and signs of illness often help determine the causal agent using the agent chart and knowing the incubation period and the reported symptoms, what do you think is the most likely agent causing this outbreak, who have we not.

407
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:21,870
amondul: So Brenda clifton and Michael can you guys answer this one, what did you guys decide for this.

408
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:24,120
amondul: Did you not get to this one.

409
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:30,000
amondul: yeah.

410
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:32,730
Michael-Ryan Lowe: Now.

411
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:45,210
amondul: let's go work through it together let's go down to those So if you went to the agent table, we have a range of like 11 to 36 hours right.

412
00:54:47,310 --> 00:54:49,800
amondul: So let's say.

413
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:57,510
amondul: Face just on time, it could be this one right every para political.

414
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,960
amondul: could maybe be equal my.

415
00:55:02,070 --> 00:55:05,790
amondul: One of these could maybe be salmonella.

416
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:11,340
amondul: botulism those are the ones that looks like to me right.

417
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:23,730
amondul: But I think we can rule out botulism because the symptoms don't seem right nobody was talking about blurred vision or paralysis right, so I think we can probably rule that out.

418
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:26,940
amondul: Salmonella sure looks right doesn't it.

419
00:55:28,890 --> 00:55:30,930
amondul: So let's keep that one on the shortlist.

420
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:43,560
amondul: Give me a pair humility focus, you know we've only got diarrhea and cramps nothing about vomiting and there was a lot of vomiting and fever right in our symptoms, so I think we're back to maybe salmonella.

421
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:46,200
amondul: and

422
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:55,590
amondul: yeah I mean, these are sort of right, it could maybe be one of these, but I think really it looks most like salmonella timmy.

423
00:55:57,690 --> 00:55:58,680
amondul: What did you guys.

424
00:55:59,130 --> 00:56:05,610
Michael-Ryan Lowe: I mean, I think it was someone else as well, due to the you know, the number of people that were sick from eating chicken.

425
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:15,300
amondul: yeah and we'll get we'll definitely get back down to that one, too, that is another kind of corroborating factor right chicken and chicken and salmonella is kind of.

426
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:19,500
amondul: whenever you get sick from chicken salmonella sort of top of the shortlist right.

427
00:56:22,410 --> 00:56:29,040
amondul: Alright, so did anybody come up with anything different because I think we decided on probably salmonella.

428
00:56:31,170 --> 00:56:31,650
amondul: yeah.

429
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:34,890
amondul: Okay.

430
00:56:36,990 --> 00:56:50,790
amondul: So they use the different definition of case using the case definition of diarrhea and vomiting the attached data table, which is down here this data table right this big table presents.

431
00:56:51,660 --> 00:57:06,420
amondul: The frequency of illness and exposure to for food items among the 52 guests at the dinner party, so you were asked to calculate the overall attack rate and the attack rates for each of the four food, food items listed in the table and remember it's also very helpful to attack to.

432
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:10,710
amondul: Look at the attack rate among those who did not eat the food.

433
00:57:11,730 --> 00:57:17,970
amondul: Because what you really want us to look at some something where it's high and those who didn't eat it but very low, and those who did not eat it.

434
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:30,120
amondul: So the overall attack rate was 62% there were a total of 52 people at the party 32 were sick, according to this definition and the table, you were given so that gives you an attack rate of 62%.

435
00:57:31,350 --> 00:57:34,590
amondul: And then, if you figure out who all ate chicken.

436
00:57:37,710 --> 00:57:43,650
amondul: And then, how many of those people got sick, we have an 83% attack rate for chicken and so on and so forth.

437
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:48,060
amondul: So if you only calculated.

438
00:57:50,610 --> 00:57:51,720
amondul: This part.

439
00:57:55,710 --> 00:58:00,060
amondul: And just didn't look at the did not eat part, what would you think might be the culprit.

440
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:06,300
amondul: You might be real excited about the beans right because 100% looks real good.

441
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:11,610
amondul: But if you then go over here.

442
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:17,370
amondul: And look at the did not eat part.

443
00:58:19,110 --> 00:58:22,620
amondul: You still have a pretty high attack rate among people who.

444
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:27,210
amondul: didn't eat the beans right.

445
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:34,770
amondul: Your next highest attack rate is the chicken and that's real low among the people who didn't eat the chicken.

446
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:44,070
amondul: So I think chicken is probably our call, but if you also go look at these 10 people who ate beans I think they all also eat chicken.

447
00:58:46,020 --> 00:58:47,580
amondul: If you actually go look in the table.

448
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:51,450
amondul: What do you guys think about that.

449
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:55,140
Yes, I agree.

450
00:58:56,520 --> 00:59:03,210
amondul: All right, did anybody get any difference i'm numbers or don't understand where we got those numbers.

451
00:59:06,630 --> 00:59:08,310
Clifton Addison: Could you could you also.

452
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:11,670
Clifton Addison: Based on these numbers.

453
00:59:12,930 --> 00:59:14,910
Clifton Addison: let's use chicken, for example.

454
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:20,040
Clifton Addison: Could we say that the 18% who did not eat chicken.

455
00:59:21,060 --> 00:59:21,450
Clifton Addison: and

456
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:25,680
Clifton Addison: Included in the attacker it could they have.

457
00:59:27,390 --> 00:59:29,040
Clifton Addison: done a secondary infection.

458
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:38,250
amondul: um you, you could look into that right like you could check on that I think it's more likely that.

459
00:59:39,330 --> 00:59:45,330
amondul: They had some sort of cross contamination they miss remembered and this reported it, you know very.

460
00:59:47,370 --> 01:00:01,320
amondul: They grabbed the tensile but someone you don't I mean like I would imagine it was more than they were actually exposed to the salmonella somehow at the party, but didn't remember eating the chicken or didn't realize it or just had a bite of someone else's or do you know what i'm saying.

461
01:00:01,740 --> 01:00:02,130
Clifton Addison: yeah.

462
01:00:02,790 --> 01:00:07,140
amondul: there's always some messiness like that it's never perfect.

463
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:09,390
amondul: And that's because people miss report.

464
01:00:09,450 --> 01:00:13,950
amondul: or they don't realize they were actually exposed to something or who knows.

465
01:00:14,490 --> 01:00:20,700
amondul: yeah pretty took the Tongue this from the chicken and second into the whatever because people are gross some.

466
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:30,900
amondul: Right so who knows exactly but you might you might double check those three people or you know, in this case, they were using a pretty.

467
01:00:32,310 --> 01:00:44,130
amondul: A pretty stringent case definition diarrhea and vomiting, but it could be, if you would included say you have used a definition included fever, maybe you've got three people who were sick with something else, and they aren't actually a case.

468
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:49,650
amondul: So it could be that, too, or they just happen to get sick.

469
01:00:50,310 --> 01:00:51,960
amondul: From something else at that moment.

470
01:00:53,070 --> 01:00:53,400
amondul: Right.

471
01:00:54,510 --> 01:00:54,930
yep.

472
01:00:57,210 --> 01:00:58,800
amondul: When he does that make sense.

473
01:00:59,340 --> 01:00:59,760
Clifton Addison: Oh yeah.

474
01:01:03,540 --> 01:01:09,150
amondul: I think, though, if there were secondary transmission, they would have to put that in sick quite a while after the other people.

475
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:11,010
amondul: Because there's.

476
01:01:11,850 --> 01:01:12,810
amondul: there's the.

477
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:16,830
amondul: incubation period for the first people to get sick and then.

478
01:01:17,070 --> 01:01:18,210
Clifton Addison: I don't know say you were taking care.

479
01:01:18,210 --> 01:01:28,260
amondul: Of a sick kid or something you got it from that person, then it would take that long again for that next person to get six so they would have to be one of the later people so it's possible you could check into it, if it was a family.

480
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:34,230
Clifton Addison: Member, so this, so the I guess the the time within which that the events that could would make a difference and all you.

481
01:01:35,730 --> 01:01:43,380
amondul: have to check who these three people who got sick were who didn't eat the chicken and maybe their family members of people who did or something you know you could try to figure that out.

482
01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:47,250
amondul: make sense.

483
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:51,720
amondul: yeah alright, so we think chicken was the likely source.

484
01:01:53,130 --> 01:01:53,970
amondul: During that chicken.

485
01:01:55,410 --> 01:02:02,370
amondul: Alright, so, then we want to know was time of eating a risk factor for becoming ill so.

486
01:02:03,450 --> 01:02:11,550
amondul: show any calculations and briefly explain your answer so who wants to go for this one, I think I called on all the groups, so now, you get to volunteer.

487
01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:15,420
amondul: Unless nobody volunteers and then i'll take something.

488
01:02:16,830 --> 01:02:22,650
Divya Manohar: I think, from the table, they seem to be a lot more people who will eat around 3pm.

489
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:24,870
Divya Manohar: To have fallen sick.

490
01:02:26,010 --> 01:02:37,410
Divya Manohar: Most likely that the food was out for quite some time and the organism would have multiplied and until the the the bacterial load of the viral load would have been much more.

491
01:02:38,310 --> 01:02:40,080
Divya Manohar: When I had consumed it yeah.

492
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:41,610
amondul: that's really makes.

493
01:02:41,670 --> 01:02:42,750
amondul: logical sense.

494
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:47,010
amondul: Did anybody do any actually actual calculations, to support that.

495
01:02:50,820 --> 01:03:06,690
Sarah Ferri: We calculated the attack rate for the one to 130 setting and the three to 3:30pm sitting at the attack rate for the one to 130 sitting was 25% and for the three to 330 city, it was 84.4%.

496
01:03:07,170 --> 01:03:07,590
Sarah Ferri: There you go.

497
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:11,730
amondul: So you did let overall attack rate right not not not food specific.

498
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:12,900
Correct.

499
01:03:14,190 --> 01:03:24,180
amondul: So that makes sense that's great you can also do what i'm showing here on the screen because you're suspecting chicken is the culprit you've decided it's the chicken at this point right.

500
01:03:24,990 --> 01:03:35,340
amondul: So, then you can calculate the chicken specific attack rate right for the people who ate earlier versus later and you see more or less the same thing right that it's much higher at the second setting so that was that was good.

501
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:39,600
amondul: yep that's it.

502
01:03:41,550 --> 01:03:44,520
amondul: Alright, any questions about that.

503
01:03:49,530 --> 01:03:50,790
amondul: Any questions generally.

504
01:03:56,040 --> 01:04:00,990
Denise White Perkins (She/Her): Peace, I have a question when you asked about the secondary transmission.

505
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:08,670
Denise White Perkins (She/Her): Once you have to really ask if any household contacts that weren't at the party got sick.

506
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:28,200
amondul: You you would yes um, I guess, we only have information on the 52 people from the party is I presume that if there were a lot of other people getting sick, we would you know we wouldn't know about them so from the data we have It certainly looks like there isn't secondary transmission.

507
01:04:29,310 --> 01:04:32,100
amondul: But you know you could you would certainly want to ask.

508
01:04:33,540 --> 01:04:37,380
amondul: You know people if anybody who wasn't at the party in their household got sick later.

509
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:37,980
Okay.

510
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:41,400
amondul: That is a good point.

511
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:49,560
amondul: Any other questions.

512
01:04:51,690 --> 01:05:08,850
amondul: All right, then for tomorrow tomorrow we're talking about measuring disease, you were to read gorgeous Chapter three before class and finished quiz two before class we're going to make the key for today today's exercise available to you so that you can look at the answers.

513
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:16,710
amondul: And will one person per group, please upload your answers for today's exercise to.

514
01:05:18,510 --> 01:05:28,530
amondul: to canvas okay one person per group, you are, you are graded on you know completeness on trying.

515
01:05:29,070 --> 01:05:38,250
amondul: it's just a did you do it or did you not eat the groups that didn't finish everything you will still get full credit that's not a problem it's just so I can kind of see what you guys have written down.

516
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:49,290
amondul: Okay, so it's not a it's just participation and making you know, making sure that you were working on it, we know that you were all working on it, the whole time so just upload.

517
01:05:50,400 --> 01:06:03,240
amondul: A little copy and then there was one group that was wondering about sharing the document amongst the group members, I think, I think that when you upload it onto canvas.

518
01:06:04,140 --> 01:06:09,060
amondul: Because you're all in the same group they're not and yes okay so because you're all in the same group, if one person.

519
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:17,820
amondul: uploads it then the rest of you will be able to get that document that was uploaded or see that document that was uploaded by your group ever because it is your submission as well, does that make sense.

520
01:06:19,260 --> 01:06:19,680
amondul: Okay.

521
01:06:20,550 --> 01:06:28,590
Geehan Suleyman: Question Are we for the quiz or the answers posted on online, or do we go over the quiz from yesterday.

522
01:06:28,770 --> 01:06:35,700
amondul: don't usually go over the quiz the answers you should be able to see the answers and what you did and did not get correct, if you are, you know.

523
01:06:38,190 --> 01:06:42,570
amondul: say that again I think it's a lot oh it's muted well you guys i'm unmuted.

524
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:57,030
amondul: So you should they're going to the teams are going to unmute it right now, so you should be able to now go see your answers and what you did and did not get correct and so, if you have questions about the quiz I would encourage you to.

525
01:06:58,410 --> 01:07:05,730
amondul: Ask the Th during office hours that would be a really good time to ask about that or if we have additional extra time at the end of class, you can always ask questions about the quiz.

526
01:07:07,470 --> 01:07:09,150
amondul: That kind of things that does that make sense.

527
01:07:10,110 --> 01:07:11,070
Geehan Suleyman: sounds good, thank you.

528
01:07:11,850 --> 01:07:12,420
No problem.

529
01:07:16,230 --> 01:07:21,600
amondul: I think, also because usually you know, the way it will work is you'll do the reading and take the quiz you might.

530
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:30,780
amondul: Miss some things on the quiz but then they might become clarified for you in the in the lecture and the exercise as we go through those so if.

531
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:39,720
amondul: You know, when you go back and look at your quiz answers, if you don't understand at that point, having had the lecture and the exercise to to kind of reinforce the reading.

532
01:07:40,110 --> 01:07:46,380
amondul: If you don't understand why you got something wrong, you know attending an office hours or shooting us an email would be a great idea.

533
01:07:48,180 --> 01:07:48,840
amondul: makes sense.

534
01:07:52,950 --> 01:07:53,550
amondul: All right.

535
01:07:54,930 --> 01:07:57,360
amondul: Okay, then I look forward to seeing you guys all tomorrow.

536
01:07:58,770 --> 01:08:01,620
amondul: And we will talk about measuring disease.

537
01:08:03,060 --> 01:08:03,600
amondul: guys.

538
01:08:05,370 --> 01:08:06,570
Divya Manohar: I thank you.

539
01:08:09,300 --> 01:08:09,810
Brenda Jenkins: Thank you.

540
01:08:10,110 --> 01:08:10,590
Thank you all.

541
01:08:21,390 --> 01:08:23,190
amondul: very, very early.
