1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:51:04,945
and then anyway I could

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:22,820
always divorce it automatically uploads

3
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:27,880
there. forget

4
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:35,080
anything I just was right there.

5
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:40,080
okay. okay. okay. is that they

6
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:46,020
were you know we figured out our technical difficulties.

7
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:52,820
my pleasure to introduce our speaker today Doctor Mark â€¦ from Harvard school of public health.

8
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:58,660
Mark got his MBA in philosophy and Yale University and then went on to

9
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:03,691
oxford university is a Rhodes scholars get his PhD in zoology

10
00:01:03,691 --> 00:01:09,491
you know there's 's short stint for a postdoc at that Emory and CDC.

11
00:01:09,491 --> 00:01:14,731
he joined the faculty at Harvard where he is right now he's currently the director

12
00:01:14,731 --> 00:01:20,491
for the center of you know communicable disease dynamics. um

13
00:01:20,491 --> 00:01:25,571
mark is more than three hundred. view publications on the impact of medical and public health

14
00:01:25,571 --> 00:01:30,571
intervention. it's Brad and the evolution of the faxes these agents and the consequence of these

15
00:01:30,571 --> 00:01:35,751
changes to human health. I've known mark for number of years now mostly through this

16
00:01:35,751 --> 00:01:42,351
consortium mathematical model is affected these dynamics and

17
00:01:42,351 --> 00:01:47,911
one thing I mean most the rest about Mark and his group is something that we are also striving to do here

18
00:01:47,911 --> 00:01:53,131
and that his group integrates basic science working in fact they do

19
00:01:53,131 --> 00:01:58,571
lab work themselves in collecting data works on rigorous

20
00:01:58,571 --> 00:02:04,225
analysis of at the population level of having logic data any brace at all with

21
00:02:04,225 --> 00:02:09,345
using mathematical models and I think that that's and I use it is groovy

22
00:02:09,345 --> 00:02:14,805
exemplar and what we have that many elders want to move towards that is integrating

23
00:02:14,805 --> 00:02:19,925
in theory with empirical studies to inform how the line friends

24
00:02:19,925 --> 00:02:26,025
and more importantly to inform public health practice. so with that.

25
00:02:26,025 --> 00:02:31,125
thank you. thanks. Joe and thanks all of you for the invitation to be

26
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:36,225
here it's been about a decade since I was here last and I looked at my old slides and

27
00:02:36,225 --> 00:02:41,325
they look like they're about twenty or thirty years all the repairs they almost had a seventies look at. if you

28
00:02:41,325 --> 00:02:46,465
can imagine but but this will be a different contract this is a talk I haven't

29
00:02:46,465 --> 00:02:51,485
given before so it maybe there about four parts to it and I might just get one depending

30
00:02:51,485 --> 00:02:56,605
on how the time goes. but I will see and the other disclaimer is that

31
00:02:56,605 --> 00:03:02,271
I changed my title a little bit to be a bit more provocative maybe and

32
00:03:02,271 --> 00:03:07,891
put my cards a little bit more on the table but

33
00:03:07,891 --> 00:03:14,091
here we go. so we

34
00:03:14,091 --> 00:03:19,271
we sort of understand what vaccines do to one individual and I picked up from an NT back sir

35
00:03:19,271 --> 00:03:24,311
to be on the on the slide because the lease and one scenario things are

36
00:03:24,311 --> 00:03:29,371
good too well for her. that's that's what happens when you're you've if asked

37
00:03:29,371 --> 00:03:35,051
but um she gets exposed to infectious

38
00:03:35,051 --> 00:03:40,511
agents whatever it is and with some probability she gets infected him with some other probability

39
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:45,731
she remains. I didn't affected and what we think vaccines

40
00:03:45,731 --> 00:03:52,831
do is they modify those probabilities to be presently lower of getting the infection

41
00:03:52,831 --> 00:03:58,771
in the in the case of a vaccinated person and

42
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:03,807
so we can fine do. the fact the of a vaccine

43
00:04:03,807 --> 00:04:09,227
on a person has just the one minus the ratio of those probabilities

44
00:04:09,227 --> 00:04:14,307
are probably got infected on one exposure if you're vaccinated divided by the front builder if you're

45
00:04:14,307 --> 00:04:19,667
on vaccinated and we can call that a relative risk and

46
00:04:19,667 --> 00:04:25,127
that ideal thing that we would like to estimate at least one thing we like the estimate

47
00:04:25,127 --> 00:04:30,367
is really hard to do because we almost never sees someone exposed exactly

48
00:04:30,367 --> 00:04:36,227
once to a to standardize those of some infection

49
00:04:36,227 --> 00:04:41,407
and therefore we have all sorts of ideas that are developed over

50
00:04:41,407 --> 00:04:47,007
decades of how we can try to get something that is similar to this vaccine

51
00:04:47,007 --> 00:04:53,167
faster vaccine efficacy as it's sometimes defined

52
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:58,807
but is it but we're always trying to get. I think something that some that is an approximation

53
00:04:58,807 --> 00:05:04,049
of this quantity which we can never do precisely and so we're

54
00:05:04,049 --> 00:05:09,049
we're we approximate.

55
00:05:09,049 --> 00:05:14,309
if we make certain assumptions then we can measure it in in a more realistic

56
00:05:14,309 --> 00:05:19,309
setting and this this idea goes back the least

57
00:05:19,309 --> 00:05:24,509
of Peter Smith 's important paper in nineteen eighty four

58
00:05:24,509 --> 00:05:29,829
lots of papers by the hell and I'm a junior group and some more recent work that we've been

59
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:35,449
involved in and yes it's true that TR

60
00:05:35,449 --> 00:05:42,769
Pete or TV depending on whether this person is vaccinated or not is the same for every exposure

61
00:05:42,769 --> 00:05:47,909
and if it's true that either there's a leaky

62
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:53,909
model of faxing action in which the probability of infection

63
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:59,121
is the same for all individuals who get vaccinated. so if it's fifty percent for a non- backed

64
00:05:59,121 --> 00:06:05,601
person maybe twenty percent for a vaccinated person vaccine is sixty percent effective

65
00:06:05,601 --> 00:06:11,021
one minus twenty over fifty yeah and

66
00:06:11,021 --> 00:06:16,041
every time you get exposed. you still have a twenty percent chance of getting infected. so probably

67
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:21,281
keep motion vaccine action or it might be that there are some

68
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:26,341
people for whom the vaccine does nothing. and others for whom is

69
00:06:26,341 --> 00:06:31,521
completely protective and then TV is not the reduction reduce probability

70
00:06:31,521 --> 00:06:36,541
for each individual but it's it's a fraction of individuals who have no chance of

71
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:41,661
getting active these kind of two extremes on continuum and that

72
00:06:41,661 --> 00:06:47,901
that distinction goes back to these early papers

73
00:06:47,901 --> 00:06:53,481
and if we do a randomized trial to try to figure out.

74
00:06:53,481 --> 00:06:58,641
we vaccinate half the people in and minimize the other have to not get the vaccine. we

75
00:06:58,641 --> 00:07:04,441
can estimate this number. this vaccine effectiveness vaccine efficacy

76
00:07:04,441 --> 00:07:09,741
under the whole number of us. if the whole number of things are true.

77
00:07:09,741 --> 00:07:15,001
if we know whether the vaccine is leaky or all or nothing. if it's one fifth

78
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:20,521
least. if it is one of those two and we know which one it is. if we observed all the infections

79
00:07:20,521 --> 00:07:25,561
that occur in the randomized trial. if we're observing it for using the

80
00:07:25,561 --> 00:07:30,561
time to events analysis like a Cox

81
00:07:30,561 --> 00:07:35,601
model or a hazard based analysis. um if if it's

82
00:07:35,601 --> 00:07:40,626
the case that all the people each group have the same exposure

83
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:45,626
as each other which is not insured by renovation minimization ensures

84
00:07:45,626 --> 00:07:50,686
that the two groups on average are the same but it doesn't ensure that all the people within each group

85
00:07:50,686 --> 00:07:56,006
for the same as each other. if we assume that the incidence rate or the cumulative incidence

86
00:07:56,006 --> 00:08:01,266
of the country being measured and yes there's no interaction between vaccine induced

87
00:08:01,266 --> 00:08:06,326
immunity and father. any new rising events that occur for example exposure

88
00:08:06,326 --> 00:08:11,566
to other pathogens that might transient weight into some kind of immunity to sing that we're interested

89
00:08:11,566 --> 00:08:16,946
in all of these are assumptions

90
00:08:16,946 --> 00:08:22,526
that are met in some cases. usually not all that and so

91
00:08:22,526 --> 00:08:28,026
a lot of I'll talk about in the next little while is how do we deal with violations of some of these assumptions

92
00:08:28,026 --> 00:08:33,346
I won't catch all of them. so the first assumption

93
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:38,378
or the first challenge that I want is a want to talk about is violation of one of

94
00:08:38,378 --> 00:08:44,158
those assumptions which is the violation of the assumption that we observed all the instructions

95
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:50,258
and if we fail to observe all the inspections and the trial. we will get serious

96
00:08:50,258 --> 00:08:55,298
inference that protection is waning and we will underestimate the

97
00:08:55,298 --> 00:09:00,418
benefit of the vaccine and also in this case I'll talk about a way of solving

98
00:09:00,418 --> 00:09:05,758
that problem. so for example in Zika loss

99
00:09:05,758 --> 00:09:10,958
of two infections for which seems being urgently sought about eighty percent infections

100
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:17,798
are thought to be a symptomatic course of clinical. therefore hard to observe possible to observe

101
00:09:17,798 --> 00:09:22,998
and we care about asymptomatic infections as an outcome in themselves or

102
00:09:22,998 --> 00:09:27,998
mild infections because for really for two reasons one is they can

103
00:09:27,998 --> 00:09:33,138
lead to transmission there's some evidence of least a movie called lost the case is mild of course

104
00:09:33,138 --> 00:09:38,348
it's a symptom infections completes transmission and in the case of Zika there's

105
00:09:38,348 --> 00:09:43,648
also evidence that what's asymptomatic for the mother can nonetheless lead to

106
00:09:43,648 --> 00:09:49,088
bad outcomes for the fetus if the mother is pregnant at the time and so

107
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:54,748
we scare about. we care about the benefits of the vaccine in preventing

108
00:09:54,748 --> 00:10:00,188
even asymptomatic infections for those two reasons. the problem is the testing

109
00:10:00,188 --> 00:10:06,728
phrase some thematic infections is expensive and time consuming and

110
00:10:06,728 --> 00:10:11,828
and so the question is can we figure out a way to insert the protection

111
00:10:11,828 --> 00:10:16,908
without measuring every single infection and

112
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:22,568
at the same time can we get rid of the bias that happens. if you failed to test.

113
00:10:22,568 --> 00:10:28,008
so had to put some cartoon to this which will help

114
00:10:28,008 --> 00:10:33,268
help I think to explain this potential bias. you have a population and you

115
00:10:33,268 --> 00:10:38,320
randomize people in that population to be vaccinated or control and

116
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:43,800
throughout the talking and to assume that everybody does what they're supposed to do in a trial I'm not gonna worry about it here it's

117
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:48,860
not gonna worry about a loss to follow up. it's gonna be

118
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:54,080
all the conditions are gonna be as good as they can be you know to to see where the classes arise

119
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:59,460
even when they are so half the people get the vaccine

120
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:05,520
have to them get control some of those people get infected and on and get symptoms

121
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:10,520
and then we have all these other people whom we don't know what's going on. we don't

122
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:17,220
know if they got infected or they didn't have symptoms or stay for maintenance

123
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:22,340
and because of that we have the problem that we

124
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:27,460
end up underestimating the benefit of the vaccine. if it's beneficial. due to

125
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:32,760
miss classification of person time at risk

126
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:37,980
and so to see what that means. consider these. now

127
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:43,224
we have vaccinated people on top of the control people on the bottom and some

128
00:11:43,224 --> 00:11:49,684
of those people get infected more in vaccine and the control group because the vaccine is protected

129
00:11:49,684 --> 00:11:55,244
and so the people in pink are the ones that are still at risk.

130
00:11:55,244 --> 00:12:00,264
but if we don't know that if we are only monitoring for symptoms then perhaps

131
00:12:00,264 --> 00:12:05,584
we see a subset of those people who are who are infected and know that they're symptomatic

132
00:12:05,584 --> 00:12:12,444
and therefore count is infected and we perceive all these other people are at risk

133
00:12:12,444 --> 00:12:18,384
including this person this person same person

134
00:12:18,384 --> 00:12:23,484
perceived to be addressed because they weren't symptomatic but they're not just because they were

135
00:12:23,484 --> 00:12:28,564
infected and so what happens is

136
00:12:28,564 --> 00:12:33,864
that is that the susceptible people to people

137
00:12:33,864 --> 00:12:38,904
at risk or move faster than removed from being at risk faster they serve

138
00:12:38,904 --> 00:12:45,114
because we only observe some of the removals and that's more so for the controls because the controls

139
00:12:45,114 --> 00:12:50,674
get more infections and so the apparent incidence and controls is underestimated

140
00:12:50,674 --> 00:12:56,034
more than apparent incidence and vaccine group and since we

141
00:12:56,034 --> 00:13:01,294
underestimate the incidence and controls that means we think oh this is a very bad infection

142
00:13:01,294 --> 00:13:08,634
and they're more similar to the vaccinated people than they should be. if we can account for this

143
00:13:08,634 --> 00:13:14,314
and this problem gets worse as the trial progresses because it's the beginning.

144
00:13:14,314 --> 00:13:19,566
there aren't very many people removed so it's just a few few people who moved

145
00:13:19,566 --> 00:13:26,326
in the biases growing as more and more people remember that we don't know about.

146
00:13:26,326 --> 00:13:34,366
yeah

147
00:13:34,366 --> 00:13:41,426
Jesus eradication of vaccine group. this person and this person.

148
00:13:41,426 --> 00:13:46,566
sorry. um so

149
00:13:46,566 --> 00:13:51,786
yeah this be about the purpose graph of these people. these people

150
00:13:51,786 --> 00:13:56,986
are meant to be the same but here we're showing this person is symptomatic and in fact

151
00:13:56,986 --> 00:14:02,126
if this person symptomatic this person is asymptomatic. oh if I get

152
00:14:02,126 --> 00:14:07,166
it. yes sorry. good good indication that this

153
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:13,306
crap needs to change for size published in black and white so I mean

154
00:14:13,306 --> 00:14:22,113
they they share exactly so

155
00:14:22,113 --> 00:14:28,013
so this looks like waning because as of any incident

156
00:14:28,013 --> 00:14:33,273
in the control group gets more and more like that in the vaccinated

157
00:14:33,273 --> 00:14:38,353
group. you guess you get

158
00:14:38,353 --> 00:14:43,753
and indicate you get the suggestion that the vaccine is doing less and less and these are some figures

159
00:14:43,753 --> 00:14:48,753
from from this for for by Joe Bernard. we wrote that shows

160
00:14:48,753 --> 00:14:54,313
the amount of the winning from your measurement of vaccine effectiveness

161
00:14:54,313 --> 00:14:59,393
over time in a low incidence setting in a high incidence and

162
00:14:59,393 --> 00:15:04,613
we included one where the vaccine is actually harmful just to show that it goes fact works and all in that case

163
00:15:04,613 --> 00:15:09,693
as well. so the higher the incidence and the more time passes the more

164
00:15:09,693 --> 00:15:14,753
this problem. purpose. and this is true and randomized trials this

165
00:15:14,753 --> 00:15:21,307
is true and observational studies like cohort studies and test negative studies and others

166
00:15:21,307 --> 00:15:26,887
so. 's are goal now is to see what can we do about this and

167
00:15:26,887 --> 00:15:32,167
this has to question we wanted to simulate an infection spreading

168
00:15:32,167 --> 00:15:38,047
it in a group of communities simulates the trial and then ask

169
00:15:38,047 --> 00:15:43,187
how could we what happens analyze the trial conventional way and

170
00:15:43,187 --> 00:15:48,987
what happens what can we do to fix the biases that occurred to us. so

171
00:15:48,987 --> 00:15:54,287
this that and some of the other work I'll talk about. we made up the pace.

172
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:59,987
simple setting that is not meant to be a perfect representation of any other any actual

173
00:15:59,987 --> 00:16:05,607
trial but is meant to just be a very simple a case

174
00:16:05,607 --> 00:16:10,827
where we can see what's going on and

175
00:16:10,827 --> 00:16:16,327
there's no it's as simple as we can make it except that we have a little bit of

176
00:16:16,327 --> 00:16:21,347
complexity in the network structure so these are communities where people have a lot of contacts within the

177
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:26,567
communities and few contacts between even that is probably unnecessary to this result is unnecessary

178
00:16:26,567 --> 00:16:31,647
to this result just to make it a little bit less toy we. we added that

179
00:16:31,647 --> 00:16:36,707
one little bit of detail. there's also a larger main population

180
00:16:36,707 --> 00:16:41,807
that infections in these communities and we

181
00:16:41,807 --> 00:16:47,007
simulate an epidemic SCI epidemic for those

182
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:52,227
who aren't used to this meditation. this is 's people address from

183
00:16:52,227 --> 00:16:57,627
being susceptible to getting infected. expose either symptomatic

184
00:16:57,627 --> 00:17:03,547
infectious or a symptomatic infectious and then they are covered

185
00:17:03,547 --> 00:17:09,047
and we have connections between people which means that they could transmit

186
00:17:09,047 --> 00:17:15,867
the infection to those contact with some probability

187
00:17:15,867 --> 00:17:20,879
and we had other people in this simulated case into the trial and

188
00:17:20,879 --> 00:17:25,999
randomize them to vaccine or control. we assume that the vaccine offers the same amount of

189
00:17:25,999 --> 00:17:31,119
leaky protection to everyone. so on infection you have some reduced probability

190
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:37,119
of becoming infected upon exposure you have some of the stability become infected and

191
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:42,159
then we can try some different ways of estimating vaccine efficacy with trying to figure out which

192
00:17:42,159 --> 00:17:47,519
is the most accurate and also efficient.

193
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:52,839
so here is the summary of what we find and

194
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:59,019
I'll talk about the details of this in a minute but just to give you an overview of what

195
00:17:59,019 --> 00:18:04,439
what we're trying to do here. the truth here is that the vaccine that we simulate

196
00:18:04,439 --> 00:18:10,179
for sixty percent protection. this rain method

197
00:18:10,179 --> 00:18:17,769
is is using cost before small hazards model. it's very straightforward

198
00:18:17,769 --> 00:18:23,209
survival analysis with the time to the infection is the outcome but

199
00:18:23,209 --> 00:18:29,169
assuming that we have perfect knowledge of when each person becomes infected. whether or not they're symptomatic

200
00:18:29,169 --> 00:18:34,629
which does perfectly gets the right answer but it's impractical because we can't know

201
00:18:34,629 --> 00:18:41,349
especially for many of these inspections are interested in when people can come.

202
00:18:41,349 --> 00:18:47,389
if we instead do the same model but only account for symptomatic infections

203
00:18:47,389 --> 00:18:52,429
then we get we get biased downward estimate of the

204
00:18:52,429 --> 00:19:00,369
fact. a. I will talk about this because of

205
00:19:00,369 --> 00:19:05,889
Central else and I can talk about that's there are some

206
00:19:05,889 --> 00:19:11,289
some other approaches but these two don't require

207
00:19:11,289 --> 00:19:16,529
you to do any testing people find out if they got infected just watch them for symptoms

208
00:19:16,529 --> 00:19:22,449
and testament they're symptomatic several other approaches

209
00:19:22,449 --> 00:19:27,949
that we do allow you to test people at the end of the study

210
00:19:27,949 --> 00:19:32,989
and see if they're if they become if they've been infected but you don't have to test them every moment during

211
00:19:32,989 --> 00:19:39,209
the study to find out when they got infected. just have to test people be able to study

212
00:19:39,209 --> 00:19:44,349
these methods and this last method which is a mutation method but I'll describe

213
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:49,469
in a minute allows you to test subset of people and still

214
00:19:49,469 --> 00:19:55,407
get the right answer. so the whole project is aiming towards that switches

215
00:19:55,407 --> 00:20:01,007
sort of the most efficient way to get the right answer.

216
00:20:01,007 --> 00:20:06,567
- sort.

217
00:20:06,567 --> 00:20:11,687
so. so let me explain them what this what some of these students. so

218
00:20:11,687 --> 00:20:17,367
what this does is it this is the story about the size

219
00:20:17,367 --> 00:20:23,087
is one third two thirds and three thirds of the way through the study.

220
00:20:23,087 --> 00:20:28,727
you test everybody and see if they become infected and that tells you what

221
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:34,367
we call it interval censored because that tells you in which interval they got infected if they test positive

222
00:20:34,367 --> 00:20:39,427
negative the first time and positive the second time and somewhere in that time they got infected.

223
00:20:39,427 --> 00:20:44,507
you know went and it's results that that's good enough to

224
00:20:44,507 --> 00:20:52,367
get to get the right answer because a

225
00:20:52,367 --> 00:20:58,014
model can work with using these people who didn't get it did get symptoms

226
00:20:58,014 --> 00:21:06,234
to gas when the people got infected with these and pills um

227
00:21:06,234 --> 00:21:11,414
the one comparable interval since Cox model.

228
00:21:11,414 --> 00:21:16,534
just have people at the end. says we're gonna run the whole trial we're gonna figure out when the Simpson matter

229
00:21:16,534 --> 00:21:21,874
people get symptomatic and then in the end we're gonna test everybody and find out whether they got infected sometime

230
00:21:21,874 --> 00:21:27,514
during the trial and that provides enough information to get the ratings

231
00:21:27,514 --> 00:21:32,694
and then this reputation approach says we're not contest test everybody. we're

232
00:21:32,694 --> 00:21:38,054
gonna test ten percent of the people at the ends and that will give us a sample random

233
00:21:38,054 --> 00:21:43,494
ten percent of people that would give us a sample of how many people became infected and then from there

234
00:21:43,494 --> 00:21:48,634
we can infer that how much we missed the depletion of

235
00:21:48,634 --> 00:21:54,412
susceptible spend correct answer so there's there's a whole paper that describes this

236
00:21:54,412 --> 00:22:00,932
but the interest of talking about more different things. I'm gonna leave it at that

237
00:22:00,932 --> 00:22:06,412
today when of question about what I just sent because I rather quickly who's ten percent. you

238
00:22:06,412 --> 00:22:11,532
hire and I mean that I can think about it. I

239
00:22:11,532 --> 00:22:18,252
think that difference is not meaningful. um yeah

240
00:22:18,252 --> 00:22:23,252
it's a different statistical approach so might be in fact it it does better but I think that differences

241
00:22:23,252 --> 00:22:28,852
and I mean

242
00:22:28,852 --> 00:22:34,892
it assumes a certain types of the trial because we have.

243
00:22:34,892 --> 00:22:40,132
seen yes yes not more but not it

244
00:22:40,132 --> 00:22:48,472
wouldn't fix the bias. yeah

245
00:22:48,472 --> 00:22:54,018
yeah right so you need enough enough you didn't know how so that here you're not getting

246
00:22:54,018 --> 00:22:59,778
a lot of noise and that â€¦ and you

247
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:04,798
yeah yep all sorts of things like that but the point

248
00:23:04,798 --> 00:23:09,878
is that with plausible size trial you can you can not test everybody

249
00:23:09,878 --> 00:23:18,378
and still get the right answer yeah

250
00:23:18,378 --> 00:23:26,858
yeah yeah you

251
00:23:26,858 --> 00:23:34,878
right for the people who invested

252
00:23:34,878 --> 00:23:40,538
their account is being infected somewhere during the fall. yeah and

253
00:23:40,538 --> 00:23:46,078
and it turns out the stuff gives you enough information all you need to know was that they were interested

254
00:23:46,078 --> 00:23:51,268
in and all these methods. what happens is that you get some information from the fax when you have

255
00:23:51,268 --> 00:23:56,448
a you have a sketch of epidemic curve from asymptomatic people and so

256
00:23:56,448 --> 00:24:01,888
that sketch is filled then but you don't know how high it was you just know the shape of it.

257
00:24:01,888 --> 00:24:07,108
you know that's like the most infections happened in weeks for whatever and that there was some curved

258
00:24:07,108 --> 00:24:12,548
and what the testing at the end we're testing a few people see any dogs is Joe in

259
00:24:12,548 --> 00:24:20,928
the height of

260
00:24:20,928 --> 00:24:26,408
fusion that is a necessary

261
00:24:26,408 --> 00:24:31,988
assumption to get this answer and so the argument would be that

262
00:24:31,988 --> 00:24:37,708
whether you're symptomatic or not is a this is a flip of a coin that doesn't change

263
00:24:37,708 --> 00:24:42,748
over that but you're right that would that's not true then that's a problem. so

264
00:24:42,748 --> 00:24:50,674
that means loses it. space is a very individual 's

265
00:24:50,674 --> 00:24:56,094
no it doesn't doesn't require that yeah I

266
00:24:56,094 --> 00:25:01,334
know the simulations and like commission I'm wondering if you

267
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:06,534
incorporate like say like some process like which individuals were lost.

268
00:25:06,534 --> 00:25:12,654
how would you produce this is what exactly it. is

269
00:25:12,654 --> 00:25:17,774
I mean it would certainly make them worse weather weather weather restore the bias

270
00:25:17,774 --> 00:25:29,894
or not. I don't have a good intuition for.

271
00:25:29,894 --> 00:25:35,274
to so summarize this and this is a describing work that was published

272
00:25:35,274 --> 00:25:40,954
recently by Rebecca con in our group. I don't

273
00:25:40,954 --> 00:25:46,074
describe the collaborators p.m. but just to say that now

274
00:25:46,074 --> 00:25:51,434
unobserved infections bias minimized and observational estimates for the no

275
00:25:51,434 --> 00:25:56,634
looks worse as time passes therefore creates a serious impression of winning and I'll talk

276
00:25:56,634 --> 00:26:02,654
about winning more in the next part in in a trial all you can solve the problem

277
00:26:02,654 --> 00:26:09,074
with your logic testing of a random sample. once at the end of the study close invitation

278
00:26:09,074 --> 00:26:14,514
infection. and I think it's important in a seminar especially

279
00:26:14,514 --> 00:26:19,814
with students around but in general to point out that no cancer

280
00:26:19,814 --> 00:26:24,914
project is actually ever complete. so there's a lot of unanswered questions and some of the ones that we think

281
00:26:24,914 --> 00:26:30,374
are particularly interesting is we often don't have good ways to tell

282
00:26:30,374 --> 00:26:35,658
zero logically meeting testing antibodies usually whether someone

283
00:26:35,658 --> 00:26:42,158
was infected or vaccinated. so this also assumes that you can tell the difference between the two.

284
00:26:42,158 --> 00:26:47,678
um we have thought very carefully about how to solve this problem in the observational context

285
00:26:47,678 --> 00:26:52,898
where maybe may not be very different but we thought about it only in the sense

286
00:26:52,898 --> 00:26:58,218
setting the trial and a big problem is that we don't know whether vaccines T or

287
00:26:58,218 --> 00:27:03,718
or what their behaviors like in the first place and I will be discussed at a little bit in the third

288
00:27:03,718 --> 00:27:09,138
stuff.

289
00:27:09,138 --> 00:27:14,338
so the second type of challenge that I want to talk about is similar

290
00:27:14,338 --> 00:27:21,138
to the first in a way at least it's the facts are similar but it's a different problem and that is that

291
00:27:21,138 --> 00:27:26,598
people are different within a group in their risk of becoming infected

292
00:27:26,598 --> 00:27:32,058
then you get again bias towards a no of no effect. and. 's.

293
00:27:32,058 --> 00:27:37,097
's impression of waiting efficacy and when I

294
00:27:37,097 --> 00:27:42,297
say heterogeneous risk of infection what I mean is that if you have

295
00:27:42,297 --> 00:27:47,617
all the vaccinated people or all the on vaccinated people some of those people

296
00:27:47,617 --> 00:27:53,417
are health care workers who get exposed every day some of those people format to almost never get exposed

297
00:27:53,417 --> 00:27:58,717
some of them are you know compromise for more likely to get infected if they're exposed to some other you know confident

298
00:27:58,717 --> 00:28:04,177
less likely get infected. either of those kinds of things or exposure or or susceptibility

299
00:28:04,177 --> 00:28:09,377
variability can create this kind of problem. so

300
00:28:09,377 --> 00:28:15,397
this is a graph of a hypothetical season of some construction

301
00:28:15,397 --> 00:28:20,417
and you have a you have a

302
00:28:20,417 --> 00:28:25,797
vaccine and then on vaccinated group and initially nobody gets infected over time

303
00:28:25,797 --> 00:28:31,017
people getting infected in both groups but I'm back but the vaccinated less.

304
00:28:31,017 --> 00:28:36,157
but as time passes. if this is kind of heterogeneity even when they're still infection

305
00:28:36,157 --> 00:28:41,817
around these two lines starts to come birds with one another the two Kurds start to converge with one another

306
00:28:41,817 --> 00:28:48,197
and the estimate of efficacy effectiveness goes down over time.

307
00:28:48,197 --> 00:28:53,377
yeah. 's. again Jean Heller and have been writing about

308
00:28:53,377 --> 00:29:00,337
this for decades and the problem is not a new one. um

309
00:29:00,337 --> 00:29:05,617
you know couple papers showed we how to how put this in the sort of

310
00:29:05,617 --> 00:29:10,817
call the notation and help to potentially explain waiting in

311
00:29:10,817 --> 00:29:17,097
each ID vaccine trials which I think is on my next slide.

312
00:29:17,097 --> 00:29:22,277
so for example um the

313
00:29:22,277 --> 00:29:27,397
are the one forty for HIV vaccine trial important well known Chevy

314
00:29:27,397 --> 00:29:32,903
trial. sounds. specific

315
00:29:32,903 --> 00:29:38,903
Africa is sixty percent thirty six percent forty one percent of thirty one percent

316
00:29:38,903 --> 00:29:44,723
chance. sorry all set and

317
00:29:44,723 --> 00:29:49,803
that might be because the vaccine is getting worse as you live with it for a while and

318
00:29:49,803 --> 00:29:54,823
the antibodies are declining or whatever but it's also consistent with

319
00:29:54,823 --> 00:30:01,723
the idea that there are just variations in risk within each

320
00:30:01,723 --> 00:30:06,983
and we tried in the newspaper to quantify how big those variability that very building was

321
00:30:06,983 --> 00:30:14,943
and showed that it was potentially explanatory of even this rather large amount of cleaning

322
00:30:14,943 --> 00:30:20,223
but the area where this is really come up a lot recently is in flu vaccine studies.

323
00:30:20,223 --> 00:30:25,683
um and one of them. Arnold sphere and

324
00:30:25,683 --> 00:30:31,503
others from from different groups and each of these groups has found him

325
00:30:31,503 --> 00:30:36,831
that over the course of the season you. 's it seems that the

326
00:30:36,831 --> 00:30:41,851
vaccine against flu is less and less effective and and most

327
00:30:41,851 --> 00:30:46,951
of those cases it's not that the fact that the virus is changing that could be happening to. we're

328
00:30:46,951 --> 00:30:51,991
not talking about that. we're not talking about the virus changing and debating the vaccine

329
00:30:51,991 --> 00:30:57,111
or talking about is people who got vaccinated in August. just not

330
00:30:57,111 --> 00:31:02,531
having as good protection. when they get exposed in February as they would have if they've been vaccinated

331
00:31:02,531 --> 00:31:11,171
sometime later we think so.

332
00:31:11,171 --> 00:31:16,611
so one of the most interesting studies in my opinion on this

333
00:31:16,611 --> 00:31:21,991
was done by the group of Kaiser in northern California. and

334
00:31:21,991 --> 00:31:27,091
what they did was to take war was was what they called the cohort

335
00:31:27,091 --> 00:31:32,617
and fax and the only test negative design that's a mouthful. so

336
00:31:32,617 --> 00:31:37,717
so what that means is they took only people who had gotten vaccinated. they didn't look

337
00:31:37,717 --> 00:31:42,737
at people who refuse the vaccines and homely people who got for some reason

338
00:31:42,737 --> 00:31:47,857
tested for influenza during the season. some of those added slides or some of those

339
00:31:47,857 --> 00:31:52,977
we're not trying to having plans and then they made a comparison that was essentially

340
00:31:52,977 --> 00:31:58,137
I'm simplifying a little but essentially they had four groups those who are vaccinated early

341
00:31:58,137 --> 00:32:03,457
and this early in the year

342
00:32:03,457 --> 00:32:08,597
and those were vaccinated late in the year and those are tested positive for flu and read

343
00:32:08,597 --> 00:32:14,337
and those are tested negative for. so everyone was tested everyone was vaccinated

344
00:32:14,337 --> 00:32:19,337
and the question was were the were the people who got

345
00:32:19,337 --> 00:32:24,417
vaccinated early. more likely to have flu on any given date have flew

346
00:32:24,417 --> 00:32:29,437
on any given day. then

347
00:32:29,437 --> 00:32:34,487
then the people who are vaccinated late and they calculated this conditional odds

348
00:32:34,487 --> 00:32:43,027
ratio for each data 's being tested and then combined using conditional logistic regression.

349
00:32:43,027 --> 00:32:49,607
so I was up here hey.. viewer for the state birth and

350
00:32:49,607 --> 00:32:55,067
when I reviewed it. we had just been working on some related

351
00:32:55,067 --> 00:33:00,347
topics and in my peer review I said this could all be

352
00:33:00,347 --> 00:33:05,567
an artifact because the high risk people were already more depleted by the time

353
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:10,807
they got a sort of the high risk people in the late

354
00:33:10,807 --> 00:33:15,897
fascinating group lot of them got infected back here and so

355
00:33:15,897 --> 00:33:20,937
of course they didn't get in fact they didn't get so over here. they because had already gone

356
00:33:20,937 --> 00:33:25,977
and for the same problem of losing people from the high risk group.

357
00:33:25,977 --> 00:33:31,937
maybe happening even in this very fancy design. I mean also said

358
00:33:31,937 --> 00:33:37,217
yes that's possible but actually we simulated it and I actually did simulations as part of my period

359
00:33:37,217 --> 00:33:42,517
which is probably reason you don't want me to be strict here if you like get a little bit excited.

360
00:33:42,517 --> 00:33:47,677
this is not usually in the other I will we did our own simulations

361
00:33:47,677 --> 00:33:53,017
and we actually have the opposite effect we found that if there is winning up the

362
00:33:53,017 --> 00:33:58,037
survey they have found waning. - the winning could be furious so to

363
00:33:58,037 --> 00:34:03,097
be an artifact and they said actually we simulated it and when we showed when we put some

364
00:34:03,097 --> 00:34:08,417
waiting into the model. we actually found that we didn't cover as much. so the fact that we found

365
00:34:08,417 --> 00:34:17,496
it means it must be really there

366
00:34:17,496 --> 00:34:22,516
so so that kind of gone horribly wrong because I

367
00:34:22,516 --> 00:34:27,956
wrote a commentary saying this is an interesting paper the date are very

368
00:34:27,956 --> 00:34:33,216
very expensive and valuable and where you heading cruises for

369
00:34:33,216 --> 00:34:38,816
one of the real editorial close to the end for. there's some

370
00:34:38,816 --> 00:34:43,836
papers right this was eight. I did I didn't get to say hurt I didn't

371
00:34:43,836 --> 00:34:50,896
get to you know I I didn't get to publish my peer review so I'm more or less published

372
00:34:50,896 --> 00:34:55,956
and thereby out it myself and because these are good

373
00:34:55,956 --> 00:35:01,536
people and serious scientists their response was not to never speak to me again.

374
00:35:01,536 --> 00:35:06,576
rather it's. we actually wrote to each other and e-mails crossed that shouldn't happen because

375
00:35:06,576 --> 00:35:11,927
everything is light speed but somehow you know takes a while to read your e-mail whatever. somehow

376
00:35:11,927 --> 00:35:17,006
we are e-mails crossed. I read to them and they wrote to me both at the same time saying hey let's get

377
00:35:17,006 --> 00:35:22,786
together and see if we can figure this out because it's important question. so we did that

378
00:35:22,786 --> 00:35:27,947
and we have two weeks. we wrote a paper and we have another one

379
00:35:27,947 --> 00:35:33,146
under review at the moment that tries to figure out what's going on and

380
00:35:33,146 --> 00:35:38,226
it turns out that we were both right there simulations were accurate. my simulations are accurate.

381
00:35:38,226 --> 00:35:43,246
and if you were listening very very carefully to what I said you

382
00:35:43,246 --> 00:35:49,546
might have a guess about what was going on. I said if there's no winning

383
00:35:49,546 --> 00:35:54,927
then the study could find waning doesn't exist. they said

384
00:35:54,927 --> 00:36:00,106
if there is waning. the study might not see all of it. so as to do those

385
00:36:00,106 --> 00:36:06,766
could both be true but it's a weird kind of bias it in one case is away from the tall

386
00:36:06,766 --> 00:36:12,000
with the null hypothesis is no waiting. in so one case it's that it's that you see

387
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:18,700
something that's not there and then another case. if it is there. you you see it

388
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:23,800
you see less of it. so it's towards the middle of nothing

389
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:28,920
and and we've made one important different assumption in our

390
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:34,020
you know our simulations which is they assume that everybody who got

391
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:39,060
vaccinated early or late. got vaccinated before the season 's flu season

392
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:44,060
started and I had assumed that the flu season started and people were continuing

393
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:49,580
to get vaccinated which is actually what happens but

394
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:54,700
they figured out how to solve this problem. so so

395
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:59,780
this was my scenario. if your fascination is occurring in the cohort after

396
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:04,780
the flu season started that in these weeks back to being some of them will have

397
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:09,880
gotten infected already in the high risk people super susceptible people

398
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:15,343
in this group especially both in effective and so you get

399
00:37:15,343 --> 00:37:20,483
it looks like being vaccinated ways is better because all these people who

400
00:37:20,483 --> 00:37:25,542
are gonna go many of these people are gonna get infected already did before

401
00:37:25,542 --> 00:37:32,603
they got vaccinated based

402
00:37:32,603 --> 00:37:38,123
on the other hand. if you make their assumption that vaccination is complete

403
00:37:38,123 --> 00:37:43,363
in the cohort before the season starts and that can't happen there's no completion of anybody from these groups

404
00:37:43,363 --> 00:37:48,723
because there's no flu to the place and

405
00:37:48,723 --> 00:37:53,743
if you further assume that there's waiting. so that these people are

406
00:37:53,743 --> 00:37:58,863
more protected than these people then you get more depletion

407
00:37:58,863 --> 00:38:04,262
from the burly group. then from the lake group of those highly susceptible people because

408
00:38:04,262 --> 00:38:09,302
these people lost some of their protection and so it slips around. I'm saying this

409
00:38:09,302 --> 00:38:15,042
very fast and if you can follow it that's better than I did for six months and

410
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:20,087
you know flipping greater than and lesson signs in the paper over and over again

411
00:38:20,087 --> 00:38:25,207
until I figured out what was going on. but so I hope that this at least vaguely makes

412
00:38:25,207 --> 00:38:31,307
some sense but the point is that it really matters whether people are vaccinated or

413
00:38:31,307 --> 00:38:37,467
whether those the whole vaccine vaccination done before the flu season.

414
00:38:37,467 --> 00:38:44,347
cans. so thanks once again

415
00:38:44,347 --> 00:38:49,587
and if there's no waning then you got the right answer. if everything

416
00:38:49,587 --> 00:38:54,587
is done before the closing. you know that there's no waiting that these people. these people

417
00:38:54,587 --> 00:38:59,607
are exactly like these people at this time in the flu season starts. so

418
00:38:59,607 --> 00:39:04,607
you don't get you don't get any difference and you were covered that

419
00:39:04,607 --> 00:39:10,027
third they are exactly alike. so

420
00:39:10,027 --> 00:39:15,250
in the first follow up paper. what we suggested was

421
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:20,310
we could actually test us we can do this in a randomized setting this is all done observational he can do this in

422
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:25,350
a randomized setting and we could ask we could do a randomized trial which

423
00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:30,690
we call first to keep two

424
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:35,950
in July. people consent to be vaccinated during a random week from August

425
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:41,130
to November. so we would randomize the time of vaccination.

426
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:46,210
we estimate the incidence and the people who

427
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:51,476
are vaccinated at different times and if that's enough to see really doesn't weigh assuming that the season

428
00:39:51,476 --> 00:39:56,496
starts in December. then we just fulfilled their assumption. he

429
00:39:56,496 --> 00:40:01,656
fulfilled us sending in fax a seem doesn't Wayne.

430
00:40:01,656 --> 00:40:08,036
then you would get the right answer but it doesn't and win if it does swing then you won't underestimate

431
00:40:08,036 --> 00:40:13,156
the amount of whining but you might still see how done that minimize

432
00:40:13,156 --> 00:40:18,196
file no one still not yet. it would be ethical I think because there's no there

433
00:40:18,196 --> 00:40:23,216
is real doubt about when you should get vaccinated. due to the swimming phenomenon.

434
00:40:23,216 --> 00:40:29,096
and but what they did instead

435
00:40:29,096 --> 00:40:34,156
was to say what if we just restrict our

436
00:40:34,156 --> 00:40:39,336
consideration to those were vaccinated for the flu season. so we just get rid of all the people

437
00:40:39,336 --> 00:40:45,096
in our sample who could be generating this curious this raining.

438
00:40:45,096 --> 00:40:50,266
just restricted to the people at the beginning. who were vaccinated before the flu season started

439
00:40:50,266 --> 00:40:55,486
and if you do that instead of getting an estimate of sixteen percent winning per month

440
00:40:55,486 --> 00:41:00,805
for twenty eight days you get an estimate of actually slightly higher eighteen percent waiting for same

441
00:41:00,805 --> 00:41:05,926
same constant stuff and essentially so you got the same answer and

442
00:41:05,926 --> 00:41:11,426
so by slightly changing the analysis. it became bulletproof

443
00:41:11,426 --> 00:41:16,706
against criticism of their annoying. viewer hands. yes same got

444
00:41:16,706 --> 00:41:21,805
answer. so that makes it I think far more compelling. there's still lots of issues with

445
00:41:21,805 --> 00:41:27,706
all sorts of observational studies and flu vaccine studies in particular

446
00:41:27,706 --> 00:41:34,345
but at least this issue. they solved by just restricting

447
00:41:34,345 --> 00:41:39,625
the time so to bring us back

448
00:41:39,625 --> 00:41:44,906
the summary is that if either of the two things I talked about so far

449
00:41:44,906 --> 00:41:50,355
had originated within groups and exposure or frailty for unobserved

450
00:41:50,355 --> 00:41:56,515
infections. then you get. 's.. 's we observe the waiting

451
00:41:56,515 --> 00:42:01,675
and renovation doesn't solve the problem because of the post renovation thing all the stuff is happening to the groups

452
00:42:01,675 --> 00:42:07,055
after they're assigned to their to their treatment. so minimization

453
00:42:07,055 --> 00:42:13,795
means balance. when you randomize in the thousand and sure that they're balanced later on

454
00:42:13,795 --> 00:42:19,855
um and so we've now propose a robust design full

455
00:42:19,855 --> 00:42:24,955
address this problem for processing winning but there's still a bunch

456
00:42:24,955 --> 00:42:30,255
of questions. the other challenge of observational vaccine studies.

457
00:42:30,255 --> 00:42:36,115
I think more interesting is can we use the immune response to

458
00:42:36,115 --> 00:42:41,295
you. actually worked on this. can we use in response to solidify

459
00:42:41,295 --> 00:42:48,683
the inferences about cleaning and maybe even analyze the outcome and maybe response together

460
00:42:48,683 --> 00:42:53,763
how does this affect interact with an agenda change during the season because of active virus itself is changing

461
00:42:53,763 --> 00:42:58,943
and that can also create changes in vaccine and how does this interact with for people

462
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:04,123
vaccination so this is a process that there are sort of goody two shoes type people

463
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:09,123
who get vaccinated early and often they like get out there in August and they get vaccinated and those are

464
00:43:09,123 --> 00:43:14,383
the same people get out there the next August and get vaccinated and uh so and there is actually

465
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:20,183
some unpublished data that suggest this is true. thanks really keen vaccinated

466
00:43:20,183 --> 00:43:25,303
kept keen vaccinate 's do it early and they do it consistently and there's other

467
00:43:25,303 --> 00:43:30,403
evidence that repeat vaccination also affects how well

468
00:43:30,403 --> 00:43:35,523
the vaccine works. so if that's true then we need to be disentangle effective

469
00:43:35,523 --> 00:43:40,523
getting vaccinated early from the very fact of getting back to me is awesome that and hasn't been

470
00:43:40,523 --> 00:43:47,193
done in the same analysis yet

471
00:43:47,193 --> 00:43:53,173
yeah this one is the first time this

472
00:43:53,173 --> 00:44:00,113
yeah actually

473
00:44:00,113 --> 00:44:08,193
for a virus. yeah right right

474
00:44:08,193 --> 00:44:13,993
when you come right the tennis

475
00:44:13,993 --> 00:44:19,133
people put it in the discussion section. uh-huh so. I of kind crazy vendor account. now

476
00:44:19,133 --> 00:44:24,153
I mean all tests are perfect but yes that and that means that you don't just miss cases but you call

477
00:44:24,153 --> 00:44:29,353
them negative. you call them controls the time.

478
00:44:29,353 --> 00:44:35,213
yeah. so that is one of that is one of the many some bullets under this

479
00:44:35,213 --> 00:44:40,533
you on know the problem with all those shows.

480
00:44:40,533 --> 00:44:46,014
years ago the accident. section

481
00:44:46,014 --> 00:44:54,794
already right.

482
00:44:54,794 --> 00:45:00,034
so. alright well I'm I'm this was all much lower than I thought but that's great

483
00:45:00,034 --> 00:45:05,154
because you actually talked to me which is different from how usually it goes I don't

484
00:45:05,154 --> 00:45:11,094
I don't know what you do to your students to make them talk but it's wonderful. thank you for that.

485
00:45:11,094 --> 00:45:16,134
so I'm gonna skip this part entirely which is mostly

486
00:45:16,134 --> 00:45:21,694
about fish vaccines. but interesting fish vaccines

487
00:45:21,694 --> 00:45:26,794
and then just very briefly tell you in the next two minutes. another project at Rebecca

488
00:45:26,794 --> 00:45:31,794
con is working on now. nothing published yet. but what we're trying

489
00:45:31,794 --> 00:45:38,154
to figure out is we'd like to know whether vaccines make you less infectious. if you get infected.

490
00:45:38,154 --> 00:45:43,194
so 's hopefully they keep you from getting infected but do they modify the course of inspection if you do get

491
00:45:43,194 --> 00:45:48,269
infected and so we'd

492
00:45:48,269 --> 00:45:53,509
like to know whether the vaccinated person who who

493
00:45:53,509 --> 00:45:59,549
who gets infected those contacts you of their contacts and

494
00:45:59,549 --> 00:46:04,589
obviously that's important because that's part of what of vaccine can do. it's beneficial.

495
00:46:04,589 --> 00:46:09,689
there's also this whole area of HIV treatment is prevention it's not a vaccine its treatment but it's still

496
00:46:09,689 --> 00:46:15,229
the same idea that treating people you make them less infectious and you can use

497
00:46:15,229 --> 00:46:21,289
you'd like to know how big that affected us. so

498
00:46:21,289 --> 00:46:26,309
in general the problem is you know vaccine trial. even if you know everybody's got infected you don't

499
00:46:26,309 --> 00:46:31,361
know who their source was and so you don't know anything about people 's infectious. 's. you

500
00:46:31,361 --> 00:46:36,421
might be able to do that to figure that out. either by contact

501
00:46:36,421 --> 00:46:41,561
tracing by knowing who has contact with him. or bye. Fire viral

502
00:46:41,561 --> 00:46:46,821
sequencing where you use the sequence of the virus to infer that so so infected someone

503
00:46:46,821 --> 00:46:52,101
else or at least that this person did not affect someone else

504
00:46:52,101 --> 00:46:57,401
and you can do that in a lot of different ways some ways are better for ruling in the infection.

505
00:46:57,401 --> 00:47:02,581
like if you have a very some are better for rolling out infection like if you have sequences

506
00:47:02,581 --> 00:47:08,161
that are way far apart then probably person this didn't affect this person because how the sequence changed that much

507
00:47:08,161 --> 00:47:13,241
and some are good for rolling in infection. where if you have a deep sequence or you know

508
00:47:13,241 --> 00:47:18,321
the variance the firewall variance experience with TES

509
00:47:18,321 --> 00:47:23,361
that are infecting two people and there's rare variants in this person that's also in

510
00:47:23,361 --> 00:47:29,244
this person it's pretty likely that they're at least close together on a chain of transmission because

511
00:47:29,244 --> 00:47:34,324
the same rare variant shouldn't occur by chance to people Mike occasionally but but often

512
00:47:34,324 --> 00:47:39,684
one not often. so we've been doing a bunch of exercises.

513
00:47:39,684 --> 00:47:44,744
again using simulated data first to figure out if

514
00:47:44,744 --> 00:47:49,844
we could use contact tracing and/or viral sequencing to to

515
00:47:49,844 --> 00:47:54,964
estimate infectious and this video

516
00:47:54,964 --> 00:48:00,024
against infectious mess and it builds on some earlier work

517
00:48:00,024 --> 00:48:05,784
looked at the ways of trying to infer who infected him

518
00:48:05,784 --> 00:48:11,304
and just cut the punch line. looks

519
00:48:11,304 --> 00:48:17,964
if we if we have a viral sequence data.

520
00:48:17,964 --> 00:48:23,640
we if we know the truth we can you know if we know everything

521
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:28,860
magically dancer. if we use viral sequence eight well oh we can

522
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:34,600
do something like we can get reasonable guesses slightly

523
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:40,060
slightly biased downwards but we got we can detect an effect on infectious at least

524
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:45,300
restrict uh the context that we infer from the viral

525
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:50,360
sequence state of people who are also known to be epidemiological contact. we get close to the

526
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:55,460
right answer point three. um and

527
00:48:55,460 --> 00:49:00,880
if we we can do some other things but. so this is all work in progress.

528
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:06,220
but I think what's interesting about it is um it builds on the old idea.

529
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:11,320
just knowing who the who in fact. that's the couple 's design for an SCI for

530
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:16,380
sexual transmitted infection. if you assume that the inspector is the other

531
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:21,860
person in a couple then you can figure out and facts. if you can't assume that

532
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:26,928
then you can use fancier things like contact tracing and viral sequences

533
00:49:26,928 --> 00:49:33,289
when you can get at least part of the way. that's also

534
00:49:33,289 --> 00:49:38,948
as I said it's work in progress is not published and I think the key question the areas that

535
00:49:38,948 --> 00:49:43,969
actually you don't know the sequence for everybody. you don't know the contact tracing for everybody. so

536
00:49:43,969 --> 00:49:49,769
we're working with Laura White Levitt. 's ever been up to

537
00:49:49,769 --> 00:49:55,208
you to try to figure out if they work on guessing who the inspectors

538
00:49:55,208 --> 00:50:00,309
are for various can be integrated with with the approach that

539
00:50:00,309 --> 00:50:07,569
we're taking.

540
00:50:07,569 --> 00:50:12,668
so last and accordingly to acknowledge the key collaborator you

541
00:50:12,668 --> 00:50:18,769
know just an for development of these ideas

542
00:50:18,769 --> 00:50:23,969
perfect automation. we want children or certain factions. Tom

543
00:50:23,969 --> 00:50:29,423
and Bruce for the Canadian collaborators

544
00:50:29,423 --> 00:50:41,943
today. so I'll stop there and thank you for such

545
00:50:41,943 --> 00:50:54,103
you you're know out of here we got a lot of questions yesterday

546
00:50:54,103 --> 00:50:59,806
I updated it was amazing yes.

547
00:50:59,806 --> 00:51:04,945
if you decide to leave for any family in regarding last your life thing
