00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,730
Welcome to this EPIT 634 is module on the our model part one epidemic conditions in this module.

2
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:19,090
I'll introduce the CSIRO model and this model.

3
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:24,060
Once the infectious recover, they are removed from the infection state and are conferred.

4
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:29,270
Lifelong and complete protection from reinfection is a two part module.

5
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:34,810
In the first part, I will focus on epidemics and the second part I will focus on endemics.

6
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:44,050
The learning objectives of this module are two one analyze and essay our transmission model to identify the dynamic properties of an essay,

7
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:52,020
our transmission model and three contrast the properties of the SDR and S.A.S. models.

8
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,650
This error model has three state variables and three parameters.

9
00:00:56,650 --> 00:01:05,920
Infection occurs through our mass action term, assuming that this that is susceptible has direct contact with an infectious individual.

10
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,420
Once recovered, an individual develops complete and permanent immunity.

11
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:20,160
This model can produce both epidemic and endemic dynamics. So the three state variables are the fraction of susceptible, infectious and immune.

12
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:26,410
And like the S.A.S. model, Mbewe represents both the birth and death rate.

13
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:32,980
Gamma represents the recovery rate and beta represents the transmission rate.

14
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:41,110
Also, as with the S.A.S. model, each equation describes forces that cause the state variable to increase or decrease.

15
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:50,060
Mbewe is the birth rate parameter. It's a per capita growth rate and is multiplied by as Placide plus SA, which in this model is equal to one.

16
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:57,660
Since we using fractions as our main state variable units and the population is constant.

17
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:03,720
Our death rate parameter is represented in each of the equations.

18
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:11,380
The recovery rate governs the rate of which an infectious person recovers and becomes immune moving into the state.

19
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:19,550
Finally, the transmission rate parameter Beda represents the new infectious per susceptible third time.

20
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:28,430
The air model compared to the S.A.S. model has the added equation for R or the immune population.

21
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:33,190
In this module, we will first explore the epidemic dynamics of the SBIR model.

22
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:39,770
And in the next module, explore the endemic dynamics.

23
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:46,700
When we explore the epidemic dynamics, we're often interested in short term dynamics, like on the order of weeks or months.

24
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:56,060
In this case, we can ignore the population or vital dynamics, which occurs over a longer timeframe, and therefore we set new equal to zero.

25
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:02,630
This is not always the case as some epidemics can last a year or longer.

26
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:13,430
So here we start by specifying that an epidemic is possible, only F.T. ADT is created in zero or only possible DADT greater than zero is possible.

27
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:20,640
That is, the number of cases must be able to increase. If we set our infectious equation.

28
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:31,550
I to be greater than zero. We get that beat at times s minus Delta all times, I must be greater than zero.

29
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:40,600
Have some algebra, we arrive at the constraint that s must be greater than Delta Overbay to here.

30
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:47,740
We have just provided a quantification of the threshold level. A number of susceptible is needed for an outbreak to be possible.

31
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:53,760
That conclusion made by Mackendrick in 1920 studying.

32
00:03:53,760 --> 00:04:00,350
What are some of the epidemic features of interest? We can characterize an outbreak by its size.

33
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:03,270
The peak number of cases.

34
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:15,750
And the attack rate, its speed, the time to peak number of cases and the number of susceptible is left at the end of the outbreak.

35
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:25,950
So like they read for us model, the epidemic properties are a function of the parameters as well as the initial number susceptible individuals.

36
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:32,100
We can predict the peak number of cases and final numbers susceptible individuals.

37
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:38,760
It turns out to do this. We can solve the SARS model with a few algebraic true tricks.

38
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:46,140
First, we divide DADT by DSF Didi's to get the following equation.

39
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:51,840
We can then solve this equation for for under the conditions that s not initial,

40
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:57,750
no acceptable is greater than Delta over Beda, which means that the number is CEPA.

41
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:14,270
Bulls are above the epidemic threshold level. When we get the fall, we then get the following equations where I-Max is the peak number of cases.

42
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:22,790
S not is the initial number is receptacles and s infinity is the final number is susceptible.

43
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:31,550
So if we know Delta Beda and s not the initial number is settles, we can predict the features of the epidemic.

44
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:38,996
This is in contrast with an endemic dynamics which is independent of the initial number of susceptible.
