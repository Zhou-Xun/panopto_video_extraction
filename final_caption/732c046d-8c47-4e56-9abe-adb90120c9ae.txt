1
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:13,440
For better or for worse. OK, so that started and hopefully we will see, OK, you guys have six on one tomorrow.

2
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:19,380
Not that I want to spend a ton of time, but does anyone have anything that they need to support you for someone?

3
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:31,680
Any burning questions that I might or might not be able to help you with just a little bit of your brain power.

4
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:36,120
OK, I don't want to spend a long time on it, but I can I can do like ten minutes or something.

5
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:43,880
If you guys have anything burning, anyone have anything just resigned.

6
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:53,320
She was like, no, this is going to be what it's going to be. Yeah, I think we're really going to, Aaron, give us a really good reason.

7
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:58,290
OK, it was I thought it was really helpful. Oh, good God, he's great.

8
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:03,840
All right. OK, then. I won't do anything. If something comes up, just let me know.

9
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:12,660
All right. So last time we did the case control, we did some strengths and limitations.

10
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:17,260
Right. With but like, you can get rare outcomes, right?

11
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:24,030
No exposure's. I apologize because I know I'm a little behind on getting you guys feedback.

12
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:27,790
I actually only have three more papers out of the two weeks worth of stuff to read.

13
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:33,720
And then I will have it back to you this afternoon with some solution keys.

14
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:40,530
I will note that I am realizing that some of my questions, which were not that clearly worded.

15
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:45,720
And so there's a few of you guys who just didn't know what I was asking you on certain questions.

16
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,350
If that's the case, I just put a note or I was like, OK, clearly this is my fault.

17
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:54,960
This was a terrible question. I have no idea what I was asking you, just like resubmit and I'll bring it up when you guys.

18
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:05,400
So go. Don't sweat it. If you see, like, something funky when you get it back, I'm more than happy to regret it if that's relative to you.

19
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:11,940
OK, good. So there also were some really interesting things that were coming up in the case control stuff.

20
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:20,580
So. Right. The key feature of the Keys control is not to sample based on your exposure distribution because the right,

21
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:28,020
the controls you're selecting to represent the exposure distribution of the population that gave rise to the cases.

22
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:33,960
There are some like sort of fascinating comments that came from some of you guys on how, you know,

23
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:41,070
sort of information bias that you'd normally think of how you collect the information actually is causing

24
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:47,790
selection bias in the study because of the way in which it's defining your cases versus your control.

25
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:58,770
Some of you guys were talking about the way in which the exposure felt contained in the case definition in some ways.

26
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:05,070
And I was spending a long time thinking about that one because it's sort of tricky if you really think about it,

27
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:13,650
because it really distracted driving is a sufficient cause of crashes.

28
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:17,460
So it's not necessary. You can crash if you're not distracted, but it is sufficient.

29
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:23,190
It can make you cause it can make you cause a crash.

30
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:28,200
You actually could wind up with problems if you excluded that from your case definition, too.

31
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:36,150
Right. So, like including it kind of raises some funky concerns, excluding at the entire actually removing people based on that.

32
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:42,480
So that sort of I didn't have a great answer for you, but I would like that is really fascinating that,

33
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:52,170
you know, there are some nuances there that makes it quite complicated. Questions on his control.

34
00:03:52,170 --> 00:04:00,300
I know I didn't do a very good job last time of the when the case control design reflects the risk ratio versus weight ratio,

35
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:04,590
we did it in the next six. So and so it all kind of piece it all together.

36
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:09,750
OK, that's great. And there's also those videos. I watch my video again just to see that it was there.

37
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:14,160
So that's helpful. That's all mine. OK, good. I'm glad it came together.

38
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:23,580
OK, so today we have this paper on systemic racism and policing in the United States.

39
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:31,200
I'm grateful that this group is an extremely resprout, respectful bunch, but I just wanted to pause before we get into it.

40
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:36,390
Right. Obviously, this is incredibly important issue from a public health perspective.

41
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:45,780
It's one that we haven't really talked that much about historically, and it's getting more and more visible these days.

42
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:52,950
I recognize that this conversation may be hard at times. Different people are coming with different experiences.

43
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:56,670
So we have some of our international students who are arriving. Right.

44
00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:05,360
And don't necessarily have that long. As much understanding in our American history that has put us in this position

45
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,480
and then there's other of you who may have this the your limited experience.

46
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:17,510
So if you find that, you know, you need to take a moment in time, please do so.

47
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:23,000
Self care is important if it makes us uncomfortable that it's OK.

48
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:36,770
It's still really important to go through. And I just want to say that doing a lot of these trainings that we do here at the university,

49
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:42,470
I see that lots of people are at different places of understanding and that's OK.

50
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:51,530
What I like to appreciate is or at least I like to assume that we are all trying to do better.

51
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:59,870
And there was a favorite line that I heard which was like, don't freeze me in time, which is basically saying that, you know,

52
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:05,960
assuming we're all trying to do better, you know, that goes kind of being,

53
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:13,640
you know, you know, recognizing that people are growing that give them that place.

54
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:20,600
I do want to say that people also make mistakes. If there is something that's painful that said, you know, let us know.

55
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:29,710
Sometimes you can just go out and that's enough explaining to folks so people can learn and having possibly a space where people can just say,

56
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:38,660
you know, oops or sorry and hopefully progress. That's my pitch in advance of this paper.

57
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:46,430
And now it's kind of, you know, it's a lot to say. But I also really do think it's important that it's something that we need to to delve into.

58
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:51,770
OK, good. So our motivations for the paper.

59
00:06:51,770 --> 00:07:04,160
Oh, I know. I wanted to say one other thing. So today I thought we would try and do is talk about the details of the paper first and then.

60
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,420
So rather than kind of pick apart each one of we go kind of like just talk about what

61
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:14,240
they did and then sort of focus on those main issues and talk about the faces bias.

62
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:22,490
So we'll see how that goes. And I'm hoping that that might be a new alternative to the way that we've talked about things like motivation.

63
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:37,280
Anyone want to talk about the public health issue that is motivating this study and a specific scientific question of interest?

64
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:42,860
That's not a good sign for our conversation with Casey Anthony,

65
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:56,490
because it's going to of like a formal relationship between police and so characteristics and the level of force is worth something.

66
00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:05,070
Yeah, right. It provides something. So they're sort of looking at these dyads and the big public health issue.

67
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:10,640
Yeah, people don't trust the police, but I think what they are trying to get at.

68
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:17,180
Yeah. I mean, I think that there are serious concerns that systemic racism is playing into our policing.

69
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:26,600
I think another big issue is the fact that excessive force normally or generally leads to injury.

70
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:32,390
So we want to prevent injury. And if we can limit excessive force, we can do that, right?

71
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:35,750
Absolutely. And right. It's not even just that.

72
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,330
It's like across the board excessive force. Right.

73
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:47,660
There is a real fear that our history, the United States is history and setting us up its differential, a different population.

74
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,100
And if you like what they were saying,

75
00:08:49,100 --> 00:09:00,990
like they were saying that like they did this because people feel that way and they want to see an increase to prove it and we want to prevent that.

76
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:05,570
Yeah. So there were a lot of interesting interpretations that I would love to talk about.

77
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:09,800
I think those are going to be important part of the conversation, but.

78
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:15,380
Right. They framed it sort of as there is the public perception, right.

79
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:23,990
That there is this problem. And so they're trying to research that. Yeah, I just have a quick question, like not about just about the paper itself.

80
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:29,030
Do you know the publication, like how long things had to be?

81
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:32,570
Because it seemed like it was a little choppy in places.

82
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:37,070
And I just was curious if it was because it needed to be a lot shorter.

83
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:46,010
Yeah. So it may be that rates of publications have word counts and, you know, different publications have different word counts.

84
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:49,760
Like I was telling you before, you know, Jamot New England Journal, a really,

85
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:56,510
really short especially one of those manuscripts, you usually have to go to a supplement to find what they actually did.

86
00:09:56,510 --> 00:10:03,080
The other thing that happens in the life course of a paper is that it never goes peer review.

87
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:07,730
And so sometimes when you see these weird non sequiturs and choppiness,

88
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:16,520
it's the authors responding to a comment and therefore it sometimes feels out of place because they've had to kind of catch up.

89
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:25,010
Yeah, I think it's Belinda who has the game of like. Can you find the reviewer comment on some of your comments?

90
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:29,750
OK, good. So we got the motivations up there starting down.

91
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:34,190
Right. So let's just talk again about what data they have.

92
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:38,000
So what is the study population? Where did they get this data?

93
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,240
And like when is it who are they?

94
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:49,370
Study in the Dallas Police Department.

95
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:55,040
Exactly. I think early on in 2014 and 2015.

96
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:03,200
So it's two years of data, right, from the Dallas, Texas police force.

97
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:10,370
And what like what's the population of, like, study that they're like, where's the data from?

98
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:20,480
Is it all people in Dallas like these families with the reports database, the reports that they file?

99
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:26,600
Right. So it's based on these lutein reports from the police officers filing.

100
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:34,650
So. So when were reports created?

101
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:56,220
And after the independence, after an event and what was the event from use of force, but not any Retek discharge of weapons or deaths in custody?

102
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,380
Yeah, right.

103
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:08,810
So these are basically it says every time is what it says, right, that a police officer engages in the use of force beyond compliant arrest.

104
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:20,840
They were filing these blue reports. The exclusion, as Cayley was saying, is that when there was the discharge of a firearm,

105
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:26,790
which basically means like I was trying to figure out what else would be a firearm and why you would not just say it.

106
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:32,000
But I don't know if they had rifles or something. I don't know.

107
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:41,330
But basically, it's excluding the the situations in which a civilian is dying under police custody,

108
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:47,630
and that's excluding the situation where a firearm was discharged.

109
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:52,040
Right. So hopefully your little alarm bells are started going off.

110
00:12:52,040 --> 00:13:04,510
Right. And that's one of those things that we should talk about. Right. So I can put it up here just to remember exclusions.

111
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:07,700
OK, so we'll remember to come back to that other. All right.

112
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:11,570
So a firearm, it wasn't just the officer's weapon.

113
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:19,160
It also fired at them, which is probably why they fired.

114
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:23,120
So that may be a nuance that I missed, but she may be right.

115
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:28,730
So let me see if I can see where that is.

116
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:35,210
Instances involving firearm discharges. You're right.

117
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:40,650
Oh, wait. But then it says officer involved shooting incidents.

118
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:46,160
Oh, no, no, you're right. There's gun shots fired by officers or at officers.

119
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:51,920
Yeah, you're right. OK, that was really helpful. I guess I'm just going to start that.

120
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:56,900
So I remember for next year, OK.

121
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:01,550
So that's something that certainly we should come back to, but that is the population.

122
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:11,300
So these are basically all incidents of arrest that had use of force beyond just compliance, like.

123
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:18,500
Yeah, okay, I'll go with you except for these situations and firearm and and custody.

124
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:30,480
OK, then how did what were their outcomes.

125
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:47,090
I know some people commented on how they have structured their outcomes. So you guys are getting ready for six.

126
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:54,110
What are you talking like, the categories that they have that horrible for before?

127
00:14:54,110 --> 00:15:03,120
Right. So there are four different categories that they had where it felt as if they were getting increasing in severity and sort of started with,

128
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:15,480
like, you know, the broad leg stance and the verbal that then went to soft and hand control, then went to hard, empty handed control.

129
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:20,310
That didn't sound like hard, empty hand control. And then it went into intermediate weapon use.

130
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:26,820
And they tell us a little bit about what those different things look like.

131
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:33,120
Were those mutually exclusive? They were not right.

132
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,890
So if an event had gone through all of those.

133
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:41,370
Right, they started verbal. They kept escalating. Right.

134
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:47,050
Those would all show up as ones for each of those.

135
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:50,070
You see Hannah thinking, right? So that's right.

136
00:15:50,070 --> 00:16:02,540
To me, that was another thing that was called out, which is kind of thinking about the outcome categories to talk about that.

137
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:12,680
OK, and what about, like, the risk factors or like whatever predictor, Esterbrook or not everything I know they included,

138
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:22,280
like your officer reported, alcohol or drug use or perceived severe mental health episode.

139
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:32,120
Yeah. So they got a bunch of information from the officers right on the call or the interactions,

140
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:40,700
those that were sort of thinking about as their main exposure is of interest or were they thinking about those sort of undercover the.

141
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:44,780
So those were other things, right. They collected things that they thought might be a confounder.

142
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:53,390
And what were the main thing like risk factors, exposures that they were interested in the danger to you?

143
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:59,420
Yeah. So those were officers and then also the gender and.

144
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:06,530
Yeah, right. So they did collect a whole bunch of things about the officers gender and race and gender and age and things like that.

145
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:13,880
But really what they were trying to get at was this diad that was sort of what was they claim is male about this work.

146
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:23,710
And what does it mean that died or are they doing something like this?

147
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:30,200
Yeah, so they were basically classifying the race or ethnicity of the officer and then they were classifying the race,

148
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:36,320
ethnicity of the civilian and they were making these what's dyads means pairs.

149
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:44,840
Right. Or two. And so they were classifying them based on sort of the officer that the civilian together.

150
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:57,470
Yes. OK, so where did they get the data on the outcomes and on all of the exposures and on all the other areas?

151
00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:07,400
Where is that data coming from or the officers making their report?

152
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,520
Anybody sort of. Right.

153
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:20,420
OK, so is making the face right, which we all probably are making so that something like really important that we should be paying attention to.

154
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:32,720
And that's another thing that you should come back to saying, I think so to speak, because there is so limited data.

155
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:42,460
There's there's no databases on this stuff, which sort of comes back to the first week where you're like, how is there not data on all this stuff?

156
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:54,200
Right. OK, so we have officer report clearly things we have to talk about that there's actually like two pieces of that.

157
00:18:54,200 --> 00:19:00,440
One was the officer report the situation. How do they classify the race or ethnicity of the civilians?

158
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:07,610
Also officer report, also officer report, which is actually to me that one is really interesting to it sort of raises different issues.

159
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:12,040
But so it's like an explosion.

160
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:24,690
Sure. And we have all the comparisons.

161
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:43,270
OK, what else, um, just in terms of how they did at the covariate, some things that they looked at, we heard a few.

162
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:53,410
I also been waged conversations on policial, which maybe is a little aggressive, but there are some people who are like tattooers.

163
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:57,980
Come on. Right.

164
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:10,030
So they got a bunch of different other risk factors that they had, which we talked briefly about, like alcohol, mental health.

165
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:15,100
Do I have the I, I have that up there to OK.

166
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:24,340
And then statistical analysis. How did they actually look at this data?

167
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:34,030
What they do is it just makes sense.

168
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:40,700
Yeah, so the logistic basically is getting us right to the law guys.

169
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:45,220
It's based on a zero one variable. Did they do it?

170
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:49,650
So logistic really just looks at a single variable, yes or no.

171
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:56,770
And that kind of comes back to that like outcome categories that it wasn't like they were doing something that has multi levels.

172
00:20:56,770 --> 00:21:04,870
Right. They were just joining us now for each. And why are they doing a mixed version of that?

173
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:10,690
Because there could be more than one report per officer.

174
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:12,910
So they did the clustering.

175
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:23,290
They were worried about correlation because if there were two officers involved in an arrest, then both officers filed their report.

176
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:32,620
They were not, interestingly, worried about the fact that like most officers had over four reports in the time frame,

177
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:41,160
they weren't doing repeat the issues based on like individual officers.

178
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:51,460
So this has to be this case based on my group, the officers who were involved in one accident,

179
00:21:51,460 --> 00:22:01,000
so they were basically putting in a random effect for the event, like each individual arrest.

180
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:15,860
So there were accounting for the fact, I think, that there were there could be multiple officers giving you the same information for one count,

181
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:22,150
like if it's one report, but like three or four different levels or.

182
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:37,420
Yeah. All right. So if you're just doing it on the confusing part, empty gap right now, that's like you're at a different one.

183
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:40,930
Yeah. So they bring it to itself. Right.

184
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:45,020
But right now, I don't know.

185
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:49,720
So I don't know. It's sort of confusing. Right. So there's actually two pieces.

186
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:55,870
One is that they are looking at for example, I forget what they're called.

187
00:22:55,870 --> 00:23:00,250
Right, hard. Empty. Yes. And they're all by itself.

188
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:02,830
They're not looking at like, OK,

189
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:09,880
let's assume that there's different levels of force and we're looking to see like what it took to go from one to the other level,

190
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:17,350
like they're doing each one separately. Then they also have the issue that they might have four different officers, civilians,

191
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:23,740
pair legs for the same exact made up for the let's say, four officers respond.

192
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:31,060
There's one civilian. I think that all four officers had to file a report.

193
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:38,950
They file it based on their specific actions or like, are they supposed to summarize like everybody on the scene?

194
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:47,510
That's a really good question. So can we tell you what do they end up doing?

195
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:53,710
Everybody, the four. So I think it informs I'm guessing that informs them all.

196
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:55,810
But that's what I was thinking, too. It's like a little bit funny.

197
00:23:55,810 --> 00:24:03,310
The mixed effects model there, when you have, like, it's not really the same in the same way because you do have four people.

198
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:10,390
But there is assuming that those things are correlated, meaning that.

199
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:15,170
Right. At least the outcome for sure should be correlated, hopefully.

200
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:22,030
Well, you're right. It depends on whether or not you're talking about the individual officers relation to the

201
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:29,530
civilian or whether or not you're talking about the worst case that happened to the civilian.

202
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:38,860
So let's say I'm one of the four officers responding. One of my colleagues goes and does a hard event on the person, but I'm not involved.

203
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:52,430
How do I report it? You can imagine that there would be correlation if I report the worst, the most extreme for any of us.

204
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:54,330
OK, so that's what they're trying to get.

205
00:24:54,330 --> 00:25:02,180
They're trying to get a correlation, but what is interesting is they're you know, they're ignoring the fact, right,

206
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:09,140
that if I interact with the same officer over and over, that officer might keep responding to me in the same way.

207
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:14,690
And so their reports might be correlated across all the different people that they interact with.

208
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:22,800
And that I did not see was the counterpart. Did you guys know some?

209
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:31,590
Two stage collapsed during an officer team reports were nested within each call.

210
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:48,310
Yeah, I guess it's possible that they're doing it by two stage clustering design and tabulated because multiple officers could repeat it.

211
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:55,230
Also, like, how are they figuring out they're together because of the date and the time,

212
00:25:55,230 --> 00:26:02,100
like really knowledgable people probably arrested at the end of the day.

213
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:08,370
So my guess is that the truth is, is that names are probably included.

214
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:17,430
They have the booking information that they've arrested somebody of the person. So my guess is that they get unique identifiers by some data manager.

215
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:25,750
It may actually now that I'm reading that again, it's a two stage clustering, like they always say,

216
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:34,610
that's nested within each call, but I wonder if they actually did the clustering by officer.

217
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:41,960
Random intercept, it's not totally clear, but that would be something I would worry about if they hadn't done right,

218
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:48,440
is to cluster on the on the officer as well. OK,

219
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:54,860
anybody want to talk about anything else about the actual methods before we

220
00:26:54,860 --> 00:27:00,050
sort of start dissecting this and have strong opinions about various pieces?

221
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:09,380
I have a general question, and this is just because I have no idea why do most of these cities,

222
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:16,140
just because of the volume, if you like, a similar type tool to this or if I never really heard much about.

223
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:21,230
I mean, my impression, at least at the time of this, was it was pretty neat.

224
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:30,800
I'm not sure if that's right, but that has been my impression. I mean, this is not from twenty seventeen, so it's now five years old.

225
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:37,430
So hopefully it's getting better. Right. More and more places are requiring, for example, cameras and things like that.

226
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:43,380
So hopefully the data has been better. But I mean, I think, you know, sort of Acadia's point, right?

227
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:51,860
Like there's not that many data sources, which is why you see a paper that uses what they have.

228
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:59,270
And I'll give them credit that I think they were trying to get the information that they need to make it better.

229
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:02,850
I mean, I think that they're well, I guess I could be wrong.

230
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:12,690
It could be that they're trying to cover their butts or whatever, but they're trying to create a data source that can be used for this.

231
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:17,510
OK, so let's see.

232
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:26,870
I have a bunch of things here. Let's talk first about the impacts of excluding the firearms and the dad.

233
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:35,630
What are we worried about there? Because generally, before you shoot somebody or someone dies, there's a lot of force being used.

234
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:42,470
So if you exclude those people, you're excluding potential forceful events that occurred before those.

235
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:49,790
Yeah. And if you were to think about the level of force. Right. Race are the most extreme situations.

236
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:55,430
So what could be the impact of excluding those?

237
00:28:55,430 --> 00:29:02,690
Yeah, those might be the ones most likely to be in the bad relationships with groups.

238
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:06,680
Yeah, right. So it's possible that that is like the most severe ones.

239
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:12,170
Those are the ones that, you know, are black population or Hispanic or whoever is suffering the worst.

240
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:18,010
And we threw them all away. So it might paint a rosy picture.

241
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:25,800
All right. That is true. OK, so that sort of issue number one.

242
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:35,460
What the implications of the binary code and doing those of separate models,

243
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:53,230
when you go to compare people to really comparing, let's say you take the hard, empty category.

244
00:29:53,230 --> 00:30:02,730
So you're comparing everybody who raped all the civilians who experienced a hard, empty use of force.

245
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:07,800
Versus those who did not.

246
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:12,150
So your mind might automatically be like, oh, well, that's better.

247
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:18,360
They had a lower level of force, right. But is that correct?

248
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:27,150
No, not necessarily. And experiencing the category, but the category is.

249
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:33,240
Yeah, right. So you're actually sort of muddling up that comparison.

250
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:43,320
And so if it is true that our police officers use greater force on people of color.

251
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:54,950
Right. What does that do to our estimate by doing these binary groupings like this?

252
00:30:54,950 --> 00:31:05,480
Observed association. Let's take four card empty, for example, it's going to be right floor.

253
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:11,930
It might be right because basically, like if it's the people of more extreme are more likely to be of color.

254
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:19,730
You know, when you're sort of lumping these people in these people, it's going to make it look like it's less related to race.

255
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:30,650
So who are the statistical modelers and how well you guys know other models that are options?

256
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:45,350
Anybody worth listening to find out if that's not the quanto aggression?

257
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:54,140
I'd have to think about that one. So the quantum regression is like, what's your likelihood of being in like a certain group?

258
00:31:54,140 --> 00:32:00,580
Right. So it's like if you had a continuum of force, what's your likelihood of being in the upper percentile?

259
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:09,950
Yeah, related to that, when their categories have to do no harm or no logistic regression.

260
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:17,210
So something like that. Right. Like multinomial or something where it basically compares people in different groups.

261
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:22,100
It maintains that auguring it doesn't treat everybody else is zero.

262
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:25,970
Yeah. So what do you do if if they were to do that instead,

263
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:31,970
would you kind of go through because what it could be categorized at more than one

264
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:40,760
table for you categorize like the most harmful one or the strongest one to put in your.

265
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:45,410
I think so. Right. I mean, so it changes the outcome of it.

266
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:51,260
And you'd have to think about the impacts of the interpretation. But I guess at the end of the day.

267
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:59,870
Right, what really matters, it's probably the most severe interaction that you have.

268
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:03,230
I don't know. I mean, I haven't thought very carefully through it.

269
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:14,240
So, like, if anyone has different opinions, I sure would be interested to see whether or not they do a constant escalation.

270
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:20,640
Like you would hope that that was the case, that they would start with the most simple measure without interacting with people

271
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:25,850
and then get more and more aggressive as people didn't comply or whatever.

272
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:32,060
But I don't know if that's true. They don't show us that information.

273
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:36,140
But I think conceptually, if I had this data in my hand, yeah,

274
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:46,190
I would look at the maximum level of force involved with this civilian and then classify it by that is probably what I do.

275
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:52,010
And what do you guys think? Yeah, I see some mods otherwise.

276
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:56,210
Right. It starts to get a little bit confusing and I'm not sure if you guys noticed,

277
00:33:56,210 --> 00:34:05,900
but I actually saw evidence of that confusion in the tables, if anyone noticed.

278
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:11,450
Take a look, for example, at table two.

279
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:22,520
And if you look at things like civilian under the influence or civilian mental health symptomology or you look at service types,

280
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,510
different kinds of things,

281
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:35,150
crime in progress or call for cover, do you see that one of them is protective and one of them is really in the opposite direction.

282
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:42,430
So how how it's like what we're talking about now, how might that happen?

283
00:34:42,430 --> 00:34:48,770
If the officer thinks the civilian is under the influence, they need to skip over that part of the administration.

284
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:56,610
Yeah, and that's not actually protected. Again, it is protective against the U.S. embassy, but it's not.

285
00:34:56,610 --> 00:35:01,660
But it's not a good thing, right? Yeah, yeah. You might look at it be like, oh, thank God.

286
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:06,780
Right. If somebody has mental health problems, if they're having a mental health crisis.

287
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:10,470
Thank goodness the police are not responding to them with hard, empty force.

288
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:14,650
And it's like, well, that's not helpful because they are responding to them with weapons.

289
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:18,720
Yeah. Since that's based entirely on the perception of the officer.

290
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:24,450
Yeah. I wonder why they didn't break down under the influence and mental health categories.

291
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:30,460
Barbours to see if they were perceiving something that might not be true.

292
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:32,340
Yeah. So. Oh yeah.

293
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:48,150
But I'm already already have problems with the military police officers, something we identified identifying the paternity of the employees.

294
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:55,120
And I'm just like I'm on am getting the I feel like I'm essentially useless.

295
00:35:55,120 --> 00:36:00,510
Yeah. So so there's two really good points. Let's let's say at table the like.

296
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:09,990
OK, police officers report a race for the next bit. But the first bit, which is kind of all related and fascinating, is this bit about right.

297
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:20,730
These are all officer reports on mental health, alcohol use and other things like that without leading you to the to an answer I'm looking for.

298
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:27,270
Like what? When you guys read that and looking at it, what are you most worried about or what are you worried about?

299
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:28,430
What are some things you're worried about?

300
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:36,630
Morgan I feel like if they took more severe action, then they probably they're more likely to say they were under the influence.

301
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:45,120
Right. So this data was all collected after the incident had happened or the arrest had happened.

302
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:49,950
Right. So if you escalated or the police officer escalated.

303
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:56,400
Right. They might be more likely to try and justify why that was.

304
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:01,440
So I would worry that the police officer reports.

305
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:06,420
Right of this, huh?

306
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:16,820
I guess it's really like these covariate. Some things like that. Right. Are going to be really, really biased and make sense.

307
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:19,410
Yeah. That point. Is that even better?

308
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:35,250
Is it more detrimental than beneficial to use them as covariate increasing to the level where every ethnicity guy and significant side of the event?

309
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:41,370
Because that's actually I think that because it's just correlated.

310
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:45,120
That's right. So what you're worrying about, right,

311
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:59,130
is that is that the people under the influence or people with mental health crises is not actually reflecting those true conditions.

312
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:05,640
And it's just that police officers are more likely to report somebody being under the influence if they are of color.

313
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:21,170
Right. And therefore, when you're adjusting for it, what you're really doing is you're just adjusting away the race effect that makes sense to people.

314
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:28,510
OK, so right, potentially biased source of information.

315
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:39,410
And so the impact we might expect, sort of as you were saying, is that you could wind up adjusting in a way of people report differently.

316
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:46,790
Somebody raise the issue of what if they're just not reporting at all?

317
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:56,150
We're assuming that this is capturing all of them. Right. But there is the fear or the worry that if people know that this might not be perceived

318
00:38:56,150 --> 00:39:01,190
well because they acted in more force than was appropriate for no great reason.

319
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:10,970
Right. Maybe they just don't report it. So if that's the case, what kind of bias do we get?

320
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:21,650
And when is it the worst, when does that buy us the worst, I think differently or in Pakistan or Afghanistan?

321
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:27,890
Right. So they know that it's a big deal now that the news is paying attention, that the population is paying attention up there,

322
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:35,240
like, oh, boy, that was excessive force and it's a black man and is not going to file that report.

323
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:41,300
That would be really problematic for some anyways.

324
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:50,120
Yeah, I'm wondering if they could still file a report for you from the paperwork side, but not report how much force they actually used.

325
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:58,790
Yeah, right. So you could just change the data and then that might change what it looks like to be learn that.

326
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:17,990
I feel like if that was happening, I would expect everybody to say verbal and verbal wasn't it was only one way or number of incidents

327
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:22,190
because that's what I asked people if they have own thing that they would try to tell us the verbal,

328
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:27,830
because you assume that probably happens in most cases of thought.

329
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:33,400
All right. But not escalating every time to that level with the American.

330
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:41,330
Or at least that's right. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, I, I mean, I don't think this is possible or might be possible.

331
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:45,910
I don't know. But I would have liked similar reports from the person from the civilian.

332
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:52,760
So you know what I mean. Because then you would get there actual like identify race, ethnicity, you know,

333
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:56,870
you would get their reported use of substances or like mental health issues,

334
00:40:56,870 --> 00:41:00,860
and then you would also get their idea of the amount of force that was used against them.

335
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:07,670
Yeah, right. So that's sort of a question of like, OK, we don't love the fact that these are only police reported.

336
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:11,000
Nobody likes that very much. What are our other choices? Right.

337
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:17,690
So one choice is that you get the civilian support as well. You could compare them and see how they stack up.

338
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:27,740
And that would be quite interesting. You know, is it possible that civilians also have a bias in the way that they report things?

339
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:33,840
Sure. Yeah, possibly. Right. So what other choices do we have?

340
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:45,050
So in cases where, you know, they're like video footage of this week, you know, it was in few where report there's a consistency.

341
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:49,280
Yeah, right. So the dashboard cams, the police vest can.

342
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,490
What do you like the body cams. Thank you.

343
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:55,850
I didn't find the body cams. Right.

344
00:41:55,850 --> 00:42:00,500
Like those data streams hopefully will help us going forward.

345
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:06,910
What's the bummer about video streams. Yeah.

346
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:12,260
Only reviewed by the police and was kept out of the water.

347
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:16,010
So you could have the same problem of who is taking the video.

348
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:20,640
Right. I mean, I was going to go to the place of, like, you've got to take the video and make it into data.

349
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:26,270
Yeah, we have lots of hands. OK, we'll go around the circle. Morgan, I was just going to say, I don't think they run all the time.

350
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:33,140
So you have to rely on that. You turn them on or not turn them off if they do well all the time.

351
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:41,480
So if officers like I'm going to use force that you just be like, no, I said, yeah, yeah.

352
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:50,180
So it's I wish is to OK, who's next? Hannah, your next step is still from the officer's perspective and it's still from there for you.

353
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:55,790
That's true. Yeah. I don't think slow down the problem like that.

354
00:42:55,790 --> 00:43:01,460
It's really hard to determine something right. Is just by looking at the it and the report,

355
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:08,270
if you're a police officer or an administrator wasn't there and you have the report and you have your body cam

356
00:43:08,270 --> 00:43:16,550
in on that report and the government influence and you want to do the word somebody that's so super objective.

357
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:19,970
Yeah. So somebody still needs to make the judgment call as to what's happening.

358
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:27,260
Right there is like the logistics of taking all of the camera footage and turning it into data that you can use.

359
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:31,050
There's the question of who's deciding what it is right. And interpreting it.

360
00:43:31,050 --> 00:43:35,930
They carry the same baggage as those other folks.

361
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:45,580
So you have the question of the identification of yes, I know you is doing just lot, but we think that we have with all this,

362
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:52,790
you know, resources to be able to give the persons, you know, raise millions to get to know the side.

363
00:43:52,790 --> 00:44:01,870
So you could ask when you book somebody. Right, that could be in the police report if you ask somebody is self report a part of your life.

364
00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:12,940
So I know it's not like I was not.

365
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:22,020
But you're not necessarily right, so you might be fine, the Golden State Data Center has stopped by the police,

366
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:31,870
like you're actually like you even just walking down the street, they ask you for your IP and then if you have, you have to have one.

367
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:35,410
I mean, you can say you don't have like you're not going to get arrested if you don't have one.

368
00:44:35,410 --> 00:44:43,330
But that's the reality. If you have warrants out. So.

369
00:44:43,330 --> 00:44:47,470
Right. So there may be ways to better link the data.

370
00:44:47,470 --> 00:44:56,050
The question I have that I think is really fascinating is if this is a situation where maybe I should say this, but.

371
00:44:56,050 --> 00:45:00,580
Right. Let's just let's be scientific. We will hypothesize.

372
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:10,660
Right, that the interactions of the police with people of color is based on their perception of their.

373
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:15,100
So at first when I read it, I was like, that's crazy, why don't you like, that's a horrible thing.

374
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:21,100
And then it occurred to me, actually, if a police officer you're worried about,

375
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:28,970
a police officer is responding to the person based on what they believe the race to be.

376
00:45:28,970 --> 00:45:35,420
Yeah, I just want to mention something that I want you to stand here today and a professor

377
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:42,210
mentioning about the difference between self reported race and what race people believe you.

378
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:52,520
And so the self reported wins actually consist of a lot of social perceptions that you believe that you are one part of the society,

379
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:59,060
whereas what people believe your race is, is mostly based on your color.

380
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:10,460
So and for this study, I feels like the police officers use of force is mostly based on what they believe your race is.

381
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:17,270
So I think it's an interesting point, because up first, as I said, when I the first time I read this, I was like, that's crap.

382
00:46:17,270 --> 00:46:22,340
And then the more I thought about it, like, actually it might be what you want.

383
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:29,030
Right. There's two different ways in which your race ethnicity changes the way in which things happen.

384
00:46:29,030 --> 00:46:36,890
Right. One is your response to the situation based on what you know of yourself and your learning experience and everything else.

385
00:46:36,890 --> 00:46:41,060
And that probably has impacts on the way in which you relate to a police officer.

386
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:49,280
But then there's also, I think, the piece that at least, you know, it feels like we're worried about, which is the police's perception of you.

387
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:57,380
Yeah, I'm assuming it's not out there, but is there studies out there that look at the difference between police lines?

388
00:46:57,380 --> 00:47:01,760
I think that's what she. Oh, please. I don't know that. You know, that's what I mean.

389
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:08,660
Like taking this data and maybe having, like, self-support like civilian or just seeing a difference.

390
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:12,710
Right. So, I mean, I would be faster if I could get my hands on other data. I'd be interested.

391
00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:18,140
Sort of. You were saying, Harry, of like, how did the civilian perceive the interaction versus the police report?

392
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:25,250
Like, how do those compare? Right. How does the police perceive the person's race, ethnicity versus what the person's race, ethnicity is?

393
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:37,700
And does that change things? I mean, most frightening and fascinating would be the situation where your perceived race was related to

394
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:45,710
the level of force and your actual race was not like if you could tease those things really hard.

395
00:47:45,710 --> 00:47:50,820
So I agree. What do you think? Because I know that one bothered to.

396
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:55,730
I mean, I understand. And I don't like it. Yeah, of course.

397
00:47:55,730 --> 00:48:01,940
I feel like it feels more like it doesn't matter where you think you are.

398
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:10,460
And that's I mean, that's part of the problem and everything that very.

399
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:14,650
Yeah, let's be very clear. Like Officer you.

400
00:48:14,650 --> 00:48:21,170
Oh yeah I know. I like that. You're right. That would have made you happy.

401
00:48:21,170 --> 00:48:27,140
Well yeah. Had we been reviewers that might have been a really legit thing to ask for.

402
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:32,430
Perceived race of civilian.

403
00:48:32,430 --> 00:48:43,660
It takes away, like, I don't know, the take away from the onus on the person like you're black, so that's why you get treated badly,

404
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:51,950
although it's not the officer you perceive someone is black and you can relate to them as a race.

405
00:48:51,950 --> 00:49:02,430
And the exposure, it's like some of exposure.

406
00:49:02,430 --> 00:49:11,410
I mean, the other thing which is really interesting that got raised by last year's class is whether or not this was even

407
00:49:11,410 --> 00:49:20,380
the right framing of the question or if this framing of what they're actually looking at is in itself incorrect,

408
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:24,340
as you were talking about, it's focused on the individual.

409
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:32,470
It makes it out as if, like, racism is an individual problem, that it's like one person who is racist.

410
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:36,340
And that's why, you know, these interactions go the way they are.

411
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:40,660
And it's like it's actually a larger system. Right. We know that to be true.

412
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:48,970
And so really focusing on these dialogs, if you pause and think about it like individual versus individual,

413
00:49:48,970 --> 00:49:52,990
may not even really be getting out the right thing.

414
00:49:52,990 --> 00:50:06,910
Yeah, and the more I think that's the one thing that I've been wondering why these

415
00:50:06,910 --> 00:50:15,880
officers were looking for Bill and the race for more information on these.

416
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:22,690
So I think. Well, actually, does anyone else want to respond before I do?

417
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:27,730
So I think this comes back to that. That's the case control design question.

418
00:50:27,730 --> 00:50:33,040
Right. So assuming that they don't throw away reports and they don't not report,

419
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:38,950
if this is complete capture of the data set, you wouldn't want to throw it away.

420
00:50:38,950 --> 00:50:45,040
It's still it's actually the full group and doing the case versus like control.

421
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:49,220
You're actually only taking a subset of of the.

422
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:52,780
I mean, I guess you could do it all of them, which is effectively what they're doing.

423
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:59,020
I mean, there's no real temporality here because it's like that's a cross section of someone's mother, I guess.

424
00:50:59,020 --> 00:50:59,230
Right.

425
00:50:59,230 --> 00:51:09,910
So what's the what's the benefit of looking at race here as our exposure you sort of talked about last week with with the cross-sectional design,

426
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:16,600
I forgot to do my little pit stop the design in advance. I was so wanting to do my little respect.

427
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:21,610
Right. So that's a terrible picture.

428
00:51:21,610 --> 00:51:24,340
It's not what we look like anymore. That's right.

429
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:31,300
But like the cross section emphasizes a I actually have any of you guys ever used a camera not as high,

430
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:41,410
you know, just like trying to be kind of like no matter what you look like.

431
00:51:41,410 --> 00:51:51,610
I'm wondering how you get those are cool. Those are the worst pictures I've heard are what else can you get like a look at your face turn off.

432
00:51:51,610 --> 00:52:00,250
Right. So I forgot to do a little cross section, but the whole idea with cross section, right, is you're just getting it up that one time.

433
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:09,190
So we often worry about the temporality which came first and started I think last week was saying that one of the benefits of something like race,

434
00:52:09,190 --> 00:52:12,730
ethnicity, because, you know, you know, which came first. Right.

435
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:19,150
Because you know that that was there already when they had that incident.

436
00:52:19,150 --> 00:52:31,780
OK, so I forget what we were talking about since I got distracted by the fact that the perception of race,

437
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:45,550
do we still know that temporality is true change over time or like time of day or.

438
00:52:45,550 --> 00:52:49,780
Well, so interestingly, right. Those are fascinating.

439
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:55,660
I bet if you did it at a different time, that you might have different answers.

440
00:52:55,660 --> 00:53:00,400
But actually what Chris is really getting at right.

441
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:06,130
Is not whether or not like if you did the study multiple years, you'd switch.

442
00:53:06,130 --> 00:53:15,940
It's actually whether or not the escalation of force changes your perception as to what somebody's race was or you write down.

443
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:20,200
So let's say somebody had a medium coloring.

444
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:34,720
Do you think that they're white with a tan, or do you think that they might be Hispanic or African-American or black based on how aggressive you got?

445
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,610
So that's the temporality you're worried about,

446
00:53:36,610 --> 00:53:44,500
you're worried about the outcome causing the exposure so that you're right that when that becomes perception,

447
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:57,540
then you could run the risk, that how aggressive the police officer became might change the way in which they report the exposure.

448
00:53:57,540 --> 00:54:03,660
That's probably that's probably true. You can imagine that could be true.

449
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:10,620
So that might be fixed a bit with the governor's administrative records that you might have today.

450
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:20,790
We find out if our licenses do serve the actual job.

451
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:25,000
But why are you so on a driver's license application?

452
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:29,610
Because most of them are right, but it's not required to fill it out.

453
00:54:29,610 --> 00:54:35,410
But you're probably right that they probably do a survey. I hadn't thought about that.

454
00:54:35,410 --> 00:54:38,580
But you're right. I don't remember answering that one.

455
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:44,940
I just got my switch. But it's been a while since I've got my bills.

456
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:55,020
But the truth is, as our records are all now pretty darn linked, I wouldn't be shocked if they can know if once you go into the police database,

457
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:59,640
you're like connected to your Social Security number and your tax records.

458
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:09,570
I put you and now your Facebook and I have a question.

459
00:55:09,570 --> 00:55:17,070
I know this is like totally off today. So I know that they looked at 10 year like across 10 year, like less than five years.

460
00:55:17,070 --> 00:55:28,680
And I was just curious if that confirms or they assume that to confirm age like younger officers would be less forceful.

461
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:32,850
But just because you've been there less than five years doesn't mean that you could have

462
00:55:32,850 --> 00:55:40,440
come from another police department or like gotten to being an officer later in life.

463
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:45,840
So I'm just curious as to why they. Yeah, so I'm not sure if it's getting an age.

464
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:53,410
I mean, what would be anyone have a good explanation for why you might think that tenure would matter?

465
00:55:53,410 --> 00:55:58,770
Yeah, there's many things that could reflect to think about training.

466
00:55:58,770 --> 00:56:07,980
And when you're first learning something and how how you learn why the information is more readily available to you.

467
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:09,740
And then also with experience.

468
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:22,440
And I think Chris brought this up in a comment that people might be more or less likely to react a certain way if they've been with the force longer.

469
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:32,700
So some people might rely on their past experience and be more reactive to a perceived threat than someone who has had the same experience.

470
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:40,170
But I think that that could go a number of ways, but it's not dependent on training and what they're exposed to.

471
00:56:40,170 --> 00:56:49,410
And I was thinking like, if you're constantly put in stressful situations and there's nothing to help you deal with the impact of

472
00:56:49,410 --> 00:57:01,200
mentally what you might see a threat or or was just based on something you remember from almost a decade ago.

473
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:09,300
Yeah. Or you might just be an older officer and you're not in as good a shape and you think, oh, I'm going to get my ass kicked.

474
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:19,320
So you rascal you up for, like kind of devil's advocate to that.

475
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:27,060
Like the ideal situation would be with more experience, you would be able to de-escalate the situation.

476
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:41,160
Yeah. Right. So yeah. So it could be right that this could either be a positive or negative reporting you would expect like somebody who

477
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:49,710
was shot in a certain speed before force in the mind to have the best resources to report the right away to people.

478
00:57:49,710 --> 00:57:52,620
Oh yeah. So it could have to do with reporting.

479
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:59,110
It could be that people who are they do feel more obligated to report or it could be that new people are scared they're going to lose their job.

480
00:57:59,110 --> 00:58:05,790
So they let's report. Are you going to say, yeah, I was going to say pretty much the to the opposite of that,

481
00:58:05,790 --> 00:58:14,620
they might be more likely to report because they might be more by the book to start to make it more lax or know what they can get away with.

482
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:24,480
But you see the medical professionals. But I do not think there's an important lesson.

483
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:35,670
But yeah, I just think, like, why brought up like my biggest issue with this variable is it doesn't represent age, you know what I mean?

484
00:58:35,670 --> 00:58:40,830
Like, they could have transferred. Yeah, but age might not be the thing that matters.

485
00:58:40,830 --> 00:58:42,750
Right. Right. Yeah, but that's what I'm just saying.

486
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:49,350
Like you could be categorized as less than five years but had been a police officer for thirty five years.

487
00:58:49,350 --> 00:58:56,950
It might carry over department department because like my dad was a fireman and like his military time contributed to his.

488
00:58:56,950 --> 00:59:05,200
It didn't matter where he was, but I don't know how policing works, but so, OK,

489
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:12,400
so we have a lot of good stories as to how tenure might relate to the outcome.

490
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:16,450
What about this thing about the dot?

491
00:59:16,450 --> 00:59:26,740
Right. I mean, really, we're interested in in the race ethnicity of the two people involved in your tenure.

492
00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:40,960
It could be related to implicit biases that you wrote about different ways, Iraq, but also like jaded you are about specific communities.

493
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:53,930
Yeah. Yeah. OK, Jillian. And then it's possible to that drop out in the force might differ by race, you know.

494
00:59:53,930 --> 00:59:58,930
Um, yeah. Maybe if you experience, like, more workplace abuse,

495
00:59:58,930 --> 01:00:04,330
maybe you'll leave the force earlier and have a different and you see things in the field happening that you're not cool,

496
01:00:04,330 --> 01:00:12,490
that you could also leave the force. So it could be possible that people leave or stay there.

497
01:00:12,490 --> 01:00:18,340
Yeah, for sure. Right. And what about I'm kind of getting back to the age and like, timing.

498
01:00:18,340 --> 01:00:24,640
Right. So it was only two years. So basically age means what generation you were born into, you kind of thing.

499
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:29,050
Right. What do we think about police officers who've been on the force a very long time?

500
01:00:29,050 --> 01:00:39,130
What race are they likely to be if those men and women of the older generations of police officers might be more like

501
01:00:39,130 --> 01:00:50,710
you're not like this or something like people who are younger and have had more exposure to crime or something like that,

502
01:00:50,710 --> 01:00:56,590
where nobody could actually identify races or more accurately, as their own race.

503
01:00:56,590 --> 01:01:03,630
Yeah, right. Is their own race likely to be related to when they were born, if they're a police officer?

504
01:01:03,630 --> 01:01:11,620
Yeah, I think it could be. I wouldn't be shocked if we didn't have a lot of black police officers in the 1960s.

505
01:01:11,620 --> 01:01:20,800
And that's right. But I think it's up to what I'm thinking about is actually related to the outcome of exposure.

506
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:28,420
OK, but I'm just thinking, like, if we believe that the police system is like systemically racist,

507
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:43,240
then wouldn't like being in the police force for longer so that for that environment like an institution that is racist.

508
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:49,230
So they make you more than I would guess or like.

509
01:01:49,230 --> 01:02:03,040
It's kind of that experience, right? I mean, so it's like this might also be this might sort of change perceptions of civilians and all kinds of ways,

510
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:08,800
not just the race, but also like whether or not they're under the influence and whether or not it's a mental health crisis.

511
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:26,010
And those might all be related to. Yeah, I guess it is a little bit different because the definition is the entire day,

512
01:02:26,010 --> 01:02:33,930
so the police officers hired when they're older than it is a generation, right?

513
01:02:33,930 --> 01:02:38,200
Yeah, that's right. So it's not a perfect match.

514
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:46,060
Right. So age is probably correlated with tenure. I would suspect that there's a correlation, but it's probably not perfect.

515
01:02:46,060 --> 01:02:53,650
So no one's talked about things like beats because those are like maybe out of control.

516
01:02:53,650 --> 01:03:03,340
I think if you're a Democrat or someone like this individual, if you see someone, you you might assume.

517
01:03:03,340 --> 01:03:08,200
That's right. And I was thinking about what are you going to tell them?

518
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:14,530
It's a horrible thing, but no one really wants what you are going to go through all the time.

519
01:03:14,530 --> 01:03:22,810
Speaking Spanish As you know. And what about tenure and neighborhood?

520
01:03:22,810 --> 01:03:34,600
Can anybody tell me a story why it might be that your tenure, for example, changes where you police these cops get the harder rounds?

521
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:38,380
Maybe or maybe like the more experienced cops get the hard balance.

522
01:03:38,380 --> 01:03:38,590
Right.

523
01:03:38,590 --> 01:03:52,060
So you could imagine that there might be a relationship, I mean, between the outcome and between the right, the the race and ethnicity due to tenure.

524
01:03:52,060 --> 01:03:58,810
So that is one that makes sense to me as an adjustment so that some of these others,

525
01:03:58,810 --> 01:04:06,610
rather than ones that people really thought were super happy and the other ones they really looked at the sort the type

526
01:04:06,610 --> 01:04:19,540
of service culture and the mental health and stability I wanted to know more about like the other and the type of calls.

527
01:04:19,540 --> 01:04:31,040
But it was a huge thing. So I felt that to I can't think of anything that would fall into another that was under cover.

528
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:31,360
Yeah.

529
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:41,750
Like, it almost implied that, like, there are people stopped just for walking down the street because you would think doing activity would be over.

530
01:04:41,750 --> 01:04:45,190
Yeah, a lot of times a lot of. I do.

531
01:04:45,190 --> 01:04:53,750
Yeah. That's what I was like. What are these. That made me think I mean I mean, what about Iraq?

532
01:04:53,750 --> 01:04:58,400
But it made me think that that could be a data issue like, oh,

533
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:04,580
I don't know exactly where to put this about, like domestic violence, a significant opposition.

534
01:05:04,580 --> 01:05:15,480
Wouldn't that be like. So this is a suspicion or like people fighting something?

535
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:18,120
Well, the other thing that's kind of confusing to me now that you look at it carefully,

536
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:23,830
right, is arrest because all of these people were arrested by definition, wasn't not for.

537
01:05:23,830 --> 01:05:34,050
No, I thought it was I think arrest me. You're like, yeah, you're brought in for whether you say.

538
01:05:34,050 --> 01:05:42,650
So. So not everything needed to result in arrest, even though it says engage in use of force beyond compliant arrest.

539
01:05:42,650 --> 01:05:48,930
So you could have just a police officer could have just beat you up and walked away and not arrested you.

540
01:05:48,930 --> 01:05:57,840
And then that would be in the data set and it would fall in there and then it would fall in other like no excuse at all.

541
01:05:57,840 --> 01:06:05,820
Right. Yeah. Chris Dismembers, how many people were in each category like other.

542
01:06:05,820 --> 01:06:11,730
Good. Ten people under all I so it's in table two.

543
01:06:11,730 --> 01:06:16,230
You can see the counts. So it says no.

544
01:06:16,230 --> 01:06:25,620
And then it's got like the and I have to remember so a is the number with versus without.

545
01:06:25,620 --> 01:06:33,720
So the slash is like with first question though is that like that incident like

546
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:39,900
I wonder like are the same psychologists saying other are the like you and I,

547
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:42,480
could these be overlapping categories. Yeah.

548
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:49,320
Or just like since we don't really know what other is like, is it like the same group of officers that just pick other.

549
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:55,260
Because do they have a trend of just like randomly stopping people or and I don't know.

550
01:06:55,260 --> 01:07:02,580
That's an interesting question. So I'm I'm thinking about these counts.

551
01:07:02,580 --> 01:07:06,060
Right. We sort of talk briefly about other choices of data.

552
01:07:06,060 --> 01:07:21,710
And actually, clearly, I thought that you were going to say this when we were looking at table one, but what else might have been nice to have?

553
01:07:21,710 --> 01:07:28,490
Anyone wish that we had this data on all interactions with the police?

554
01:07:28,490 --> 01:07:37,700
I'd be kind of curious about that. How are related to everybody? You mean like not just stuff with police force?

555
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:43,460
We're just like any interaction. Yeah, but that's something I'm nothing better about.

556
01:07:43,460 --> 01:07:51,420
So let me get to the people that they never followed or never interact with because

557
01:07:51,420 --> 01:07:57,640
of their race situations where absolutely it's going to be the same exact thing.

558
01:07:57,640 --> 01:08:02,870
And absolutely, you're absolutely right. Does that make sense to people?

559
01:08:02,870 --> 01:08:11,670
Just. All right.

560
01:08:11,670 --> 01:08:20,470
How do we take a short break and when we come back in a few minutes.

561
01:08:20,470 --> 01:08:29,490
Yeah, yeah. Oh, always so important.

562
01:08:29,490 --> 01:08:47,770
Yeah. So patients usually but not so like it's still relatively small, but it should be so.

563
01:08:47,770 --> 01:08:57,570
I know that I saw somewhere that the official racial identity concerning a nine percent white,

564
01:08:57,570 --> 01:09:07,070
Hispanic and African-American and I feel like I really don't have the Asians is not usually something, you know.

565
01:09:07,070 --> 01:09:17,130
So I think that unless they're oversampling. So like I we're on this multi-ethnic study about where I work, that they oversampled actually Chinese.

566
01:09:17,130 --> 01:09:20,620
It wasn't even all Asians. It was like the oversampled Chinese in the United States.

567
01:09:20,620 --> 01:09:26,250
So that way they could, except for some black, white, Hispanic, black and Chinese.

568
01:09:26,250 --> 01:09:30,960
So but I think I mean, I'm still right. The other does not work well.

569
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:36,770
But I think that's a reason people are doing this because of the lower house.

570
01:09:36,770 --> 01:09:44,820
And I think it makes sense. But this is do well and it's like it winds up happening, not like in the United States.

571
01:09:44,820 --> 01:09:49,380
I mean, you could very easily see you have a lot of people from China with like,

572
01:09:49,380 --> 01:09:53,400
you know, people who are Native American who who've lived here forever.

573
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:59,130
And you could mix them with, you know, those horrible categories tend to like immigrants,

574
01:09:59,130 --> 01:10:05,040
like you like with the ABC, with the Chinese who were born in America.

575
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:12,240
And so those that actually if you ask yourself self reporting and I think within American,

576
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:18,210
Asian and we I think we identify ourselves as Asian or China.

577
01:10:18,210 --> 01:10:24,850
So it's still like a difference in self reporting, the difference and the genetics, the and things like that.

578
01:10:24,850 --> 01:10:34,530
So I was studying Jennifer's and then studying man, yet she has all the genetics and her students are doing that.

579
01:10:34,530 --> 01:10:44,370
And then it was Briana's we asked about the self reported and versus the genetics and she said that it was because so genetics,

580
01:10:44,370 --> 01:10:55,530
things you can't change is in your genes. But the stuff like the and that's why I want to see, like, how things influence the genetics.

581
01:10:55,530 --> 01:11:01,030
We want to see like the ancestry, but not like what you think yourself as.

582
01:11:01,030 --> 01:11:06,810
Yeah, well, and it's really interesting because the question of what is race mean for health.

583
01:11:06,810 --> 01:11:11,850
Yeah. And so I think for a long time people have thought that there's like biological differences.

584
01:11:11,850 --> 01:11:16,020
And it's like that's really about what about in the United States? Yeah.

585
01:11:16,020 --> 01:11:21,930
It's not really predominantly about genetic differences. Usually, it's usually about social rights.

586
01:11:21,930 --> 01:11:24,300
So that's why we are doing what we are.

587
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:33,090
So my parents, there's one study I'm doing and seeing how they perceived discrimination that you actually influence your genetics level.

588
01:11:33,090 --> 01:11:39,230
So I think that's when you combine an environmental genetics.

589
01:11:39,230 --> 01:11:46,050
Yeah. Yeah. If you actually physically adopt racism, then that's that's not racism.

590
01:11:46,050 --> 01:11:51,690
You adopt discrimination in some way and your body is changed. Yeah.

591
01:11:51,690 --> 01:12:00,000
Yeah. Well, I mean, the other thing that's fascinating, right, is like this is a very relevant paper for the United States right now of our history.

592
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:04,230
And you imagine that different countries each have their own history that we have.

593
01:12:04,230 --> 01:12:08,490
I think like different states like this is in Dallas, Texas.

594
01:12:08,490 --> 01:12:12,150
Right. So that's actually about generalizability question that I was going to get at some point.

595
01:12:12,150 --> 01:12:22,640
Right. It's like. Right. You get a different answer. If you are in Mississippi, then you might get if you are in California or if you are in and.

596
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:30,240
Yes, yes, I yes, Texas. I know Texas and Dallas like.

597
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:36,930
I actually don't have a great sense as to like, I don't know, a great census to Dallas.

598
01:12:36,930 --> 01:12:43,650
History is that is the biggest one of the that I don't know if it's the biggest city,

599
01:12:43,650 --> 01:12:48,020
but I've been there and I know it's why it's so different than here.

600
01:12:48,020 --> 01:12:53,040
What have you been doing in Dallas?

601
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:59,880
I've been to Galveston, Houston, Austin, Dallas, like Dallas is different than all those, you know,

602
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:07,580
and they're all I mean, they're all Texas, but they're like very different vibes in each place.

603
01:13:07,580 --> 01:13:10,360
Wow, this is ridiculous, and we all know this by now,

604
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:17,200
but it's so funny to see people without their maps on, I'm like, you look like what I thought you were.

605
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:26,860
Oh, man. Was eye contact is the most important things now need to express the emotions in your eyes.

606
01:13:26,860 --> 01:13:32,080
Yeah, that's right. This thing that it's like forcing children to make eye contact.

607
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:38,410
So like kids that may have been like more shy or just like how their body language is,

608
01:13:38,410 --> 01:13:44,020
it's like almost forcing them to make contact with like like older adults.

609
01:13:44,020 --> 01:13:50,520
So it's a changing body language that during like developmental time frames.

610
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:51,790
Yeah. Yeah.

611
01:13:51,790 --> 01:13:59,410
I was on our street, had a little like street party last weekend, and I was talking with one of my neighbors who I think is on the spectrum,

612
01:13:59,410 --> 01:14:06,430
and he like not he he was sort of able to periodically look at me in the eye, but he could not retain it for that long.

613
01:14:06,430 --> 01:14:09,970
And you could tell he was trying really hard. And I'm like, oh, I'm sorry.

614
01:14:09,970 --> 01:14:17,140
This is this conversation is clearly very uncomfortable. Yeah.

615
01:14:17,140 --> 01:14:25,150
Well, ZEW, I think is fascinating, too, because Zuweid, you're rarely that close to people in real life, you know what I mean?

616
01:14:25,150 --> 01:14:32,680
Like, until you're actually really right up in people's faces. Yeah.

617
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:37,270
I discovered all kinds of problems with myself. I'm like, oh my God, I'm in a spot here.

618
01:14:37,270 --> 01:14:48,950
And I didn't realize.

619
01:14:48,950 --> 01:14:57,130
So did you take someone before you're taking out some of our master's students.

620
01:14:57,130 --> 01:15:07,410
Don't tell them something. And Chris, you went through the online bit, right?

621
01:15:07,410 --> 01:15:12,640
Yeah. How are the in-person classes comparing to the online? Pretty good.

622
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:17,890
Pretty good. You are an AP, though, right? Because you didn't come through my class.

623
01:15:17,890 --> 01:15:25,670
I did attract foreign students for the first track and the spiritual epidemiology after that.

624
01:15:25,670 --> 01:15:28,220
Cool. But you don't have to take my class.

625
01:15:28,220 --> 01:15:40,770
No, I thought the special AP was in the AP series or did something to them and say I was in the second one that didn't have your class.

626
01:15:40,770 --> 01:15:46,020
Well, you still get to see my family because they're all there, if you.

627
01:15:46,020 --> 01:15:53,370
I mean, you don't have to, but that's what I've been posting videos from outside my the club retroactively get access to those courses.

628
01:15:53,370 --> 01:15:57,060
Yeah, all of them. That's cool.

629
01:15:57,060 --> 01:16:06,590
Now, I saw some, like Michigan Infinite Learning or something like that, you can watch or you can like enroll in classes forever.

630
01:16:06,590 --> 01:16:12,180
Maybe someday when I retire. I know, like, I really want to take a geology class.

631
01:16:12,180 --> 01:16:17,250
I'm fascinated by geology, but I did take one when I was in college for a short bit.

632
01:16:17,250 --> 01:16:22,710
But it was so boring at the time. And now you're like, oh, I'd love to think about it.

633
01:16:22,710 --> 01:16:26,950
None of you are. I think I am.

634
01:16:26,950 --> 01:16:34,180
Things I thought was a stupid way. That's why I don't like you're just the stuff I forgot.

635
01:16:34,180 --> 01:16:40,180
And, you know, look, I wish I could remember things like my college class that I love.

636
01:16:40,180 --> 01:16:51,490
And I'm like now I just I have a general understanding of what we covered, but I don't know the areas that I wish one day.

637
01:16:51,490 --> 01:16:56,070
So kind of ready for materially different times. Yeah. Yeah.

638
01:16:56,070 --> 01:17:06,300
That I want you to remember to take my organic chemistry early on in life was so hard and that I didn't like I was.

639
01:17:06,300 --> 01:17:10,620
So I would feel that.

640
01:17:10,620 --> 01:17:18,930
Although if you can honestly tell you what I know, I put my wife covid yesterday and I'm like, what if I get back in the morning?

641
01:17:18,930 --> 01:17:23,430
What do I do about what my dad what went through my mind when I did my bit?

642
01:17:23,430 --> 01:17:28,830
So I did it yesterday and twenty four hours an hour and a half.

643
01:17:28,830 --> 01:17:32,550
Remember last time I did it. So all over the floor.

644
01:17:32,550 --> 01:17:36,060
Yeah. So do you guys have to get tested out here.

645
01:17:36,060 --> 01:17:41,140
No, I just back in case I go home like my mom takes care of my nine year old grandma.

646
01:17:41,140 --> 01:17:47,520
I don't want to take any chances. I remember once a week, just for peace of mind.

647
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:56,730
Has anyone been able to get those home tests? I think for five years, I say, sure, sure.

648
01:17:56,730 --> 01:18:01,370
Went, Oh, no, they never signed up for something.

649
01:18:01,370 --> 01:18:09,420
Oh, yeah. They had a they had a study at work together that takes about one minute and then I don't know, we wanted to just have some for her.

650
01:18:09,420 --> 01:18:15,270
And I went to the store one day and the dude right in front of me, like, took all of them off the shelf and just bought them all at once.

651
01:18:15,270 --> 01:18:26,080
And I was like, do I make a fuss or do I just let it go just this year?

652
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:30,360
Yeah. Yeah, it's definitely not. Yeah.

653
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:34,080
Because I went there, we got back in less than 12 hours, which was nice.

654
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:38,190
But now I feel like most might think about 30 hours to get back.

655
01:18:38,190 --> 01:18:42,960
Yeah. And it's just.

656
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:51,720
Yeah. All right, fine. We were just about to start.

657
01:18:51,720 --> 01:19:06,400
OK, so I think the only other thing to look at now is maybe just kind of going through the different results to understand what they're presenting.

658
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:16,230
OK, so let's see the table one. So this is basically giving us all the descriptions.

659
01:19:16,230 --> 01:19:25,800
Anyone find anything particularly interesting first? I mean, just the verbal thing that I've done or that I would expect that.

660
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:32,390
Yeah, that's true. But I don't have that sort of stuff the next time.

661
01:19:32,390 --> 01:19:46,740
I think that might be where people started. Yeah, I wonder if that's point.

662
01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:52,560
Yeah. These are displayed first.

663
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:58,680
This is the only thing I could think of is if there is a officers reporting it,

664
01:19:58,680 --> 01:20:06,210
they just read out on the thing that they did a verbal first and they just report that they did not do without explicitly saying.

665
01:20:06,210 --> 01:20:11,210
They also did verbal anything that could be like that.

666
01:20:11,210 --> 01:20:15,000
So, yeah, it seems the way the officers report those could be different.

667
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:18,540
Like one may report. Oh, I was verbal and then I did this.

668
01:20:18,540 --> 01:20:22,870
Or one could just look at the most extreme. Yeah.

669
01:20:22,870 --> 01:20:32,970
I'm like looking at these details again, like George Flouride would have been to put that up in soft empty.

670
01:20:32,970 --> 01:20:41,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That would be something like how many of those showed up on.

671
01:20:41,220 --> 01:20:46,680
That's right. He would not have made it in the data set. But like we think of soft empty as being less severe.

672
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:50,550
Right. But that's not necessarily true.

673
01:20:50,550 --> 01:20:52,890
Yeah.

674
01:20:52,890 --> 01:21:09,060
I think the percentage of that influence seems high, but I think that means you're either, like drunk or high or you have some sort of drug on board.

675
01:21:09,060 --> 01:21:10,360
It is fascinating. Right.

676
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:21,960
So the question is, is like, is that truth or is that the officers reporting based on how you set some mental health disorders?

677
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:32,220
Not not all, but like some symptoms of mental disorders that are getting treated can look like someone may be under the influence.

678
01:21:32,220 --> 01:21:36,060
So they have just like because they use force automatically categorized as that.

679
01:21:36,060 --> 01:21:40,950
So it could be that just a little bit higher than some of them are in the wrong.

680
01:21:40,950 --> 01:21:45,870
You know what I mean? Yeah, exactly right. Yeah.

681
01:21:45,870 --> 01:21:54,870
Yeah, for sure. Right. And for a long time, our police officers have not been well trained on how to deal with mental health symptoms.

682
01:21:54,870 --> 01:21:59,760
So the 50 percent might not be OK.

683
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:04,530
I mean, I was kind of fascinated by how many people, how many officers were shot,

684
01:22:04,530 --> 01:22:14,100
how many times that they actually wondered, did it tell us what the average number of times for anything I said?

685
01:22:14,100 --> 01:22:22,680
Because it just says greater than before. Percent said, I think it did somewhere.

686
01:22:22,680 --> 01:22:26,370
Also, I think it's so what there was what?

687
01:22:26,370 --> 01:22:30,810
Thirty five hundred and almost three thousand incident.

688
01:22:30,810 --> 01:22:35,400
Was that right. Did everybody didn't have a report.

689
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:38,700
Right. Like I said, how many.

690
01:22:38,700 --> 01:22:42,210
Like how many. I think it's about thirty five hundred roughly.

691
01:22:42,210 --> 01:22:51,750
Police officers. Right. And not everyone had a report which I feel like are you really never going to have an arrest,

692
01:22:51,750 --> 01:22:57,680
but you even have to do like some type of verbal like that seems to maybe the officer.

693
01:22:57,680 --> 01:23:04,470
Yeah, there's probably a lot of people who never go out in the field. It's my guess.

694
01:23:04,470 --> 01:23:13,160
That's right, but I suspect that there's what we call paper pushers, because I kind of say that seemed odd, but that makes sense.

695
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:20,170
Feel like they have people that investigate like forgeries and what I mean that they have their own division.

696
01:23:20,170 --> 01:23:29,370
And I think so probably. OK, table to side with you.

697
01:23:29,370 --> 01:23:33,660
Add up all the white citizens. Yeah.

698
01:23:33,660 --> 01:23:37,980
It's twenty one percent of our interactions like that.

699
01:23:37,980 --> 01:23:44,520
He's worth and I look at the population of Dallas is 63 percent white.

700
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:56,230
So it's like a third of what you would expect that there would be. And yeah, I'm, I'm deep breathing because that's a big difference.

701
01:23:56,230 --> 01:24:04,300
That's a huge difference, and it's I guess that wasn't the point of the paper,

702
01:24:04,300 --> 01:24:11,950
but interesting that that was highlighted for they and that kind of goes back to your thing, right?

703
01:24:11,950 --> 01:24:15,100
Is it really that there's really different crime rates and different groups,

704
01:24:15,100 --> 01:24:20,650
or is it really just that whites are more likely to get away with the same actions?

705
01:24:20,650 --> 01:24:25,390
Oh, OK. Have a chair, of course.

706
01:24:25,390 --> 01:24:33,520
Oh yeah. Sorry. Does using a mix effect model to account for correlation.

707
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:43,510
I just thought the effect of going out with a certain group of police officers like you are all white officers.

708
01:24:43,510 --> 01:24:50,700
Is that different than the same officers being in a more diverse or.

709
01:24:50,700 --> 01:24:59,730
Yeah, I'm so I think that you're right that there would be more information given if there was

710
01:24:59,730 --> 01:25:11,250
differences in the group and random effects are slightly different than the fixed effects of one,

711
01:25:11,250 --> 01:25:18,180
bit like it goes towards a population average. The other one is like an absolute thing for that incident.

712
01:25:18,180 --> 01:25:25,130
But my instinct is that you'd get more information off of it if there was a disparity in terms of the police.

713
01:25:25,130 --> 01:25:32,010
Um, I mean, I guess there could be more than one stability then of that, but yeah, I know anyone else.

714
01:25:32,010 --> 01:25:45,750
Bias that's not. It's awesome, I mean, I think that's my intuition, is that you'd get more information on those.

715
01:25:45,750 --> 01:25:52,380
I still think that clustering by events is a little bit funny, but.

716
01:25:52,380 --> 01:25:57,210
OK, so table chair, what's a little bit nice about table chairs?

717
01:25:57,210 --> 01:26:01,890
You do get those values right? That counts.

718
01:26:01,890 --> 01:26:11,070
So you can actually make yourself a little two by two tables if you want to, because you know, the number of white white diad,

719
01:26:11,070 --> 01:26:20,520
for example, that have no hard entry and that's hard empty versus those who do or Flecktones with versus without.

720
01:26:20,520 --> 01:26:27,840
So it's actually it's literally chibi to table except for the white weight as your reference group.

721
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:32,160
So you can see and just a little bit here.

722
01:26:32,160 --> 01:26:47,990
So what kind of measures could they be calculating here if they wanted to be calculated, the odds ratio, but they could have done something else to.

723
01:26:47,990 --> 01:26:58,760
But I think you're saying that here as well, so it is I would argue this is a problem for her to share.

724
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:14,910
What else could you do in addition to an ratio? You could do a permanent solution to your problems.

725
01:27:14,910 --> 01:27:25,560
I tend to like risk ratios and prevalence ratios better than I like odds ratios because odds ratios always overestimate the magnitude.

726
01:27:25,560 --> 01:27:28,920
So there's like a cool little proof I can share with you guys if you want.

727
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:37,440
But if something is positive, like greater than one, your odds ratio will be further away from one than your risk or your prevalence ratio.

728
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:38,580
And if it's less than one,

729
01:27:38,580 --> 01:27:48,300
it will be more negative than the probability disorder or the risk aversion that exaggerates the magnitude, unless that's rare.

730
01:27:48,300 --> 01:27:55,990
In which case I'd go with the model that is so now.

731
01:27:55,990 --> 01:28:03,870
So then instead of doing this, you'd have to run like a binomial regression instead of a budget.

732
01:28:03,870 --> 01:28:17,490
But in our work, like in my group, we will we will almost always run binomial instead of Maloja if the data support it.

733
01:28:17,490 --> 01:28:28,660
OK, what else do we see here? What is this one trying to answer?

734
01:28:28,660 --> 01:28:44,990
Anything interesting people wanted to talk about? It's the difference between people and people.

735
01:28:44,990 --> 01:28:52,760
Yeah, I saw that you had to ask that. So what's the big difference between the two?

736
01:28:52,760 --> 01:29:02,540
Kind thing that I think that the big difference between the two is that they broke out the race dyads.

737
01:29:02,540 --> 01:29:04,370
I think in table two.

738
01:29:04,370 --> 01:29:15,200
I think they're both adjusted as well for my interpretation was that in table two, they just did white, white versus white, non white.

739
01:29:15,200 --> 01:29:27,140
And then in table four, they did the breakup. I saw what the numbers were slightly different from that, which in terms of pounds or in terms of the.

740
01:29:27,140 --> 01:29:32,540
I agree. So it was interesting because they look they're pretty similar.

741
01:29:32,540 --> 01:29:40,340
So like, for example, you know, the male gender, Fourcade, M.D. is like one point five three versus one point five.

742
01:29:40,340 --> 01:29:45,470
Two one is like point nine versus one.

743
01:29:45,470 --> 01:29:54,380
I think that's just that that added information and that shifts these other associations a little bit.

744
01:29:54,380 --> 01:30:08,700
That was my read at least. It is a little weird for you to say that about table three because like the ordering of the table, right?

745
01:30:08,700 --> 01:30:20,640
I mean, really, it's really weird, right? So table three is the crude and it's got all of the dyads versus table four as the adjusted.

746
01:30:20,640 --> 01:30:24,330
So you can kind of see how things are shifting, right.

747
01:30:24,330 --> 01:30:38,990
A little bit. It's a little late this time, so you can see whether or not confounding is coming into play at all.

748
01:30:38,990 --> 01:30:55,070
It's not always consistently a direction which I thought was kind of interesting.

749
01:30:55,070 --> 01:31:01,520
You guys see what I'm doing, so I'm just eyeballing between table three's results for the dyads,

750
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:08,330
which is a crude analysis versus the table for which is adjusted.

751
01:31:08,330 --> 01:31:24,440
The other thing actually that table three has, which table four does not as the other outcomes, the verbal in the soft empty.

752
01:31:24,440 --> 01:31:34,780
So what did you guys, like, take away from the answers, like what did you think was the main findings here?

753
01:31:34,780 --> 01:31:40,330
I don't know, you don't know? I don't know how I feel about this study.

754
01:31:40,330 --> 01:31:46,300
Yeah, right. So whether or not you think that the data is valid, but like, even if you take it at face value and say,

755
01:31:46,300 --> 01:31:53,860
OK, these are these are close to the truth, which you may not be the case at all.

756
01:31:53,860 --> 01:32:08,230
How did you guys feel about the way in which they talked about stuff? The public health implications were.

757
01:32:08,230 --> 01:32:20,390
I mean, I don't know, like in the debate about where they need to improve versus what I think didn't really tell me anything, really.

758
01:32:20,390 --> 01:32:23,870
I mean, truthfully, those things aren't things that they studied anyways. Right.

759
01:32:23,870 --> 01:32:28,990
Like, they're just trying to give you the implications. OK, so Chris, on that, I didn't see who it was on that.

760
01:32:28,990 --> 01:32:37,910
I think the way they talked about the results of the model kind of swept away by great relationships like food didn't exist anymore.

761
01:32:37,910 --> 01:32:42,600
And the coverage they used were probably very biased.

762
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:48,240
So the food away a true relationship and put it into those.

763
01:32:48,240 --> 01:32:51,950
Right. So there's fear whether or not they took away everything.

764
01:32:51,950 --> 01:33:00,050
I mean, I actually think that the adjusted versus the creator are pretty darn similar.

765
01:33:00,050 --> 01:33:03,270
So I just flip back and forth now.

766
01:33:03,270 --> 01:33:09,500
The last one, Hispanic black chefs a lot.

767
01:33:09,500 --> 01:33:29,390
But the others are, to me, compellingly telling me that what if you look at intermediate weapon use, what of those results say to us?

768
01:33:29,390 --> 01:33:37,810
How do you read those?

769
01:33:37,810 --> 01:33:54,760
Let's take one of them, the the the white black Reistad, how do I interpret the two point three four in table four for intermediate weapon use?

770
01:33:54,760 --> 01:34:11,120
One officer may have higher up using a weapon use facing facing one to two over two times the.

771
01:34:11,120 --> 01:34:17,700
Over two times, some of these are like four times.

772
01:34:17,700 --> 01:34:25,080
They focused a whole [INAUDIBLE] of a lot on statistical significance in this paper.

773
01:34:25,080 --> 01:34:34,560
We don't want to focus on statistical significance, significance. It's about the power you have, how many samples you have, how variable your data is.

774
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:45,660
When I look at these results, I compellingly see the story that with the exception of the Hispanic Hispanic, which is very fascinating.

775
01:34:45,660 --> 01:34:47,100
Right.

776
01:34:47,100 --> 01:35:03,590
Almost every other diet has a higher likelihood of the civilian experiencing intermediate weapon use than when the interactions between white people.

777
01:35:03,590 --> 01:35:12,630
Anyone treated any differently, when I look at it,

778
01:35:12,630 --> 01:35:21,560
it's hard to think that it might be the possibility that the civilian protection officer

779
01:35:21,560 --> 01:35:27,870
might also try to be more aggressive towards the officer because of their race.

780
01:35:27,870 --> 01:35:31,580
But there's also some intimidation there.

781
01:35:31,580 --> 01:35:35,360
So that was like a little bit back to that thing. I lost sight of what matters, right?

782
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:42,890
Is it really your own race and ethnicity and what I mean, actually, they're perceiving the officer as well.

783
01:35:42,890 --> 01:35:49,010
So it's the civilians perception of the officer versus their own knowledge of who they are.

784
01:35:49,010 --> 01:36:04,100
Right. Might change their behavior. The police officer's perception of the civilian might change their behavior.

785
01:36:04,100 --> 01:36:05,930
Yeah, I just think it was quite interesting.

786
01:36:05,930 --> 01:36:16,280
I also do think this like inverse association with other with things like hard, empty and the others were interesting as well,

787
01:36:16,280 --> 01:36:27,830
because it does really make me wonder whether or not people are just jumping to intermediate weapon.

788
01:36:27,830 --> 01:36:36,700
There still is some more hard and fast.

789
01:36:36,700 --> 01:36:43,630
For other things, right, gender differences were kind of interesting.

790
01:36:43,630 --> 01:36:55,750
The tenure, so we weren't sure what way it would go, but it certainly looks as if people who are on the force longer have higher rates of pay rates,

791
01:36:55,750 --> 01:37:03,310
but they're have a higher odds of being intermediate weapon.

792
01:37:03,310 --> 01:37:11,570
Yes, civilian being men also has a big impact.

793
01:37:11,570 --> 01:37:20,990
Under the influence, the mental health and the multiple adjusted regression actually doesn't look bad,

794
01:37:20,990 --> 01:37:24,920
so that actually seems to suggest that they might be that the officers,

795
01:37:24,920 --> 01:37:39,100
when they perceive mental health issues, might be less likely to use heart empty and have the same rate of might not influence their intermediate.

796
01:37:39,100 --> 01:37:51,190
Anything else? I had a question and it gives me a round table talks about that in choosing a reference group.

797
01:37:51,190 --> 01:37:57,520
There's a number of ways you can do it. I'm most often heard she was based on the size of the groups.

798
01:37:57,520 --> 01:38:03,340
The largest is your reference group, and that would lead to the most stable.

799
01:38:03,340 --> 01:38:08,050
But like here, the right dyad is the reference group.

800
01:38:08,050 --> 01:38:16,540
The female gender is for both officers and civilians is the reference group.

801
01:38:16,540 --> 01:38:22,060
And so I was wondering here what the rationale would be.

802
01:38:22,060 --> 01:38:29,380
And I think one would be showing the greatest positive effect sizes.

803
01:38:29,380 --> 01:38:40,360
So even the reference group demonstrates that males are more likely to have intermediate weapon use.

804
01:38:40,360 --> 01:38:44,650
So then it's easier to interpret as a reader. So you talk about that.

805
01:38:44,650 --> 01:38:50,950
Yeah. So does anyone else have ideas as to why they picked those groups?

806
01:38:50,950 --> 01:38:59,230
So it's just my own, but I feel like they are study especially on the resistance and the resistance.

807
01:38:59,230 --> 01:39:07,180
From my understanding, the racism in the United States is mainly from white people to the other kind of people.

808
01:39:07,180 --> 01:39:11,200
So if they're choosing white, one died as a reference group,

809
01:39:11,200 --> 01:39:21,910
they want to study how the other diet is behaving contrary to the main work that we consume,

810
01:39:21,910 --> 01:39:31,000
that we have to assume that it is the least possible group that is experiencing racism.

811
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:36,910
And I guess I think it's based on their you know, I think it's based on their scientific question,

812
01:39:36,910 --> 01:39:39,550
which is sort of what you were saying, which is that right.

813
01:39:39,550 --> 01:39:46,240
That, you know, the question is, is whether or not people who are not white are experiencing.

814
01:39:46,240 --> 01:39:50,350
Right. More force than people who are white. That's sort of their fundamental question.

815
01:39:50,350 --> 01:39:53,080
I think similarly, these other ones. Right.

816
01:39:53,080 --> 01:39:58,330
I think they just pick the groups that they thought would experience the least and then that were comparing.

817
01:39:58,330 --> 01:40:03,160
So that would be my interpretation as well. Right.

818
01:40:03,160 --> 01:40:10,300
If you had picked, for example, you know, Hispanic, Hispanic, it wouldn't really as a reference group,

819
01:40:10,300 --> 01:40:14,810
it wouldn't really have addressed the scientific question as easily.

820
01:40:14,810 --> 01:40:19,610
And that's the most direct. How much do the group size does matter?

821
01:40:19,610 --> 01:40:23,400
And yeah, I mean, that's an interesting question.

822
01:40:23,400 --> 01:40:33,910
Right. So there is some validity to you want a stable thing to compare to and there's still probably plenty of people.

823
01:40:33,910 --> 01:40:38,020
And how many people are in that group. Quite right.

824
01:40:38,020 --> 01:40:46,460
Was seven hundred and sixty five people. So it's still not small.

825
01:40:46,460 --> 01:41:05,640
Yeah, okay, so anything else anyone wants to talk about the paper or anything specific reading,

826
01:41:05,640 --> 01:41:16,550
you're not going to give up some of the confidence interval that that really on some days,

827
01:41:16,550 --> 01:41:29,510
where are they able to take this is fun table to look at it to probably intermediate weapon use,

828
01:41:29,510 --> 01:41:51,020
which is for civilian mental health is one point zero sum game or you to cover everything from before it happens.

829
01:41:51,020 --> 01:41:55,610
People are not perfect. Real nice. Yeah.

830
01:41:55,610 --> 01:42:02,640
Sometimes you can kind of eyeball to them to see if they're not in the middle. I mean, it is a log on so you get a little bit askew.

831
01:42:02,640 --> 01:42:06,620
Oh, I know what I was looking for.

832
01:42:06,620 --> 01:42:13,790
Gentzler right for each other. So many mistakes, so many.

833
01:42:13,790 --> 01:42:19,310
You don't know which ones you can actually learn. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

834
01:42:19,310 --> 01:42:23,270
That is pretty big from right there. Oh I know.

835
01:42:23,270 --> 01:42:31,610
The other thing I was going to say about your question, Julian, and the way in which people want to report pause.

836
01:42:31,610 --> 01:42:38,630
So having talked with Sharon Kerr, this is her pet peeve.

837
01:42:38,630 --> 01:42:42,950
She doesn't like to report a protective association.

838
01:42:42,950 --> 01:42:55,910
She'll always flip them. You guys know why? Cool thing about ulcerations.

839
01:42:55,910 --> 01:43:14,840
And ratios in general. There's a compression of things that are less than one because it's bounded by zero.

840
01:43:14,840 --> 01:43:20,090
You can't have a negative ratio, whereas you can have an infinity.

841
01:43:20,090 --> 01:43:27,450
You can have it really big. And so sometimes if you look at things that are like point eight, you're like, oh, that's not that big of a deal.

842
01:43:27,450 --> 01:43:33,370
But if you flip it on its head so you change the reference group, it'll all of a sudden look a lot bigger to you.

843
01:43:33,370 --> 01:43:37,160
Yeah. So that could be one of the other reasons, right.

844
01:43:37,160 --> 01:43:45,400
That you pick your reference groups to make it so that you're not really reporting protective.

845
01:43:45,400 --> 01:43:54,910
OK. Did we get it to everything that we wanted to do, officer report?

846
01:43:54,910 --> 01:44:05,190
OK, so what do people think about this study? Well, because they would rather have they not done it at all?

847
01:44:05,190 --> 01:44:11,330
No. Yeah. OK, here's the other thing, Kate.

848
01:44:11,330 --> 01:44:18,240
If you're saying that the police report is really problematic, right.

849
01:44:18,240 --> 01:44:29,380
We agree that that's problematic. What do we expect to be the impact of the police reporting as compared to the truth?

850
01:44:29,380 --> 01:44:41,020
People underestimate. I don't think it might underestimate the sense that the police might be more likely to change the answer.

851
01:44:41,020 --> 01:44:47,260
This says there's a pretty hard line on the government with fines.

852
01:44:47,260 --> 01:44:53,710
If this study didn't exist with its crappy data, we'd have nothing here.

853
01:44:53,710 --> 01:45:06,400
We have something where we think that it's probably too low and it's still atrocious really early on this year.

854
01:45:06,400 --> 01:45:17,710
That's two point ninety three point four. I think when I read the very fact that when you adjust for civilian mental health,

855
01:45:17,710 --> 01:45:22,690
there's no relationship like that is how they actually look at the data.

856
01:45:22,690 --> 01:45:31,330
Yeah, and that's how the news is going to report. It is probably going to be harmful.

857
01:45:31,330 --> 01:45:35,800
I agree. I was I really did not like their focus on statistical significance.

858
01:45:35,800 --> 01:45:39,400
Right. So in that like centric thing. Yeah.

859
01:45:39,400 --> 01:45:45,700
They're like variations in the odds of intermediate weapon use between white and nonwhite by and white white.

860
01:45:45,700 --> 01:45:49,540
We're not statistically significant after we controlled for these things.

861
01:45:49,540 --> 01:45:53,890
Odds ratio almost two with a 95 percent confidence interval.

862
01:45:53,890 --> 01:46:03,370
Wait for it between point nine, eight and three point four.

863
01:46:03,370 --> 01:46:20,420
Graphically speaking, you know, like to see three one.

864
01:46:20,420 --> 01:46:32,430
It's not fair. Please, as epidemiologists be careful of P values, this is not a fair like I write.

865
01:46:32,430 --> 01:46:41,180
I mean, I hope everyone's skin is crawling, that somebody would look at this and say there's nothing happening.

866
01:46:41,180 --> 01:46:49,670
Yes, I agree, I was I was I was upset with our interpretation, had I been the reviewer, they would have talked about it differently.

867
01:46:49,670 --> 01:46:53,510
But again, it's like if you and I probably would have said, like,

868
01:46:53,510 --> 01:47:02,570
given the fact that this was from a police database, we would expect that this might be even higher.

869
01:47:02,570 --> 01:47:08,180
But I don't know about you guys, but I am happy that it happens.

870
01:47:08,180 --> 01:47:14,300
Paper, it has its weaknesses. And boy, I hope we do better and getting better data.

871
01:47:14,300 --> 01:47:21,170
Right, but hopefully at least it tells us we need to get better data, that we need to do better if we didn't already know it.

872
01:47:21,170 --> 01:47:29,810
I would say like to be collected this data between twenty fourteen, twenty fifteen and the study was published until twenty seventeen.

873
01:47:29,810 --> 01:47:31,820
So I would hope, which I'm not sure if it has,

874
01:47:31,820 --> 01:47:39,620
but I would hope that databases like this have come a long way in representing what is actually happening.

875
01:47:39,620 --> 01:47:49,430
Yeah, I agree. I mean I think that. Right. Somebody even reported that there that Dallas now has the mandatory cameras, the it's like ground laws.

876
01:47:49,430 --> 01:47:55,790
I Googled it and said it's now law that you have to turn it on every time they go out, go.

877
01:47:55,790 --> 01:47:59,960
But at the same time, I mean, I think it comes down to an accountability issue as well.

878
01:47:59,960 --> 01:48:02,090
What happens if they don't turn right?

879
01:48:02,090 --> 01:48:10,970
And that's that's something that I think needs to be fixed, obviously on a greater level is you can say you have it's mandatory thought to turn it on.

880
01:48:10,970 --> 01:48:16,450
But then when they come back and the day after the and they said, oh, I turned it off like, what's going to happen to the office?

881
01:48:16,450 --> 01:48:23,640
And I think that's what's best for us to be held accountable. And I think. Yeah, for sure.

882
01:48:23,640 --> 01:48:34,040
OK, two more things before we wrap up on this paper. So, one, generalizability, it's this paper, one that you had generalize elsewhere.

883
01:48:34,040 --> 01:48:40,340
Why not using one police department to summarize it?

884
01:48:40,340 --> 01:48:44,150
The New York Police Department is so different. So.

885
01:48:44,150 --> 01:48:51,540
Right. So the United States, we have a lot of variation and in the history that we have.

886
01:48:51,540 --> 01:48:55,820
And so one police department and Dallas, as we were talking earlier.

887
01:48:55,820 --> 01:49:05,420
Right. Like I might not get the same answer if I was in Louisiana, if I was in Portland, Oregon, if I was in Massachusetts.

888
01:49:05,420 --> 01:49:12,460
So you'd have to think carefully about whether or not you're going to get the same results everywhere, which I think we agree might not be OK.

889
01:49:12,460 --> 01:49:18,500
I'm one other game who has computers open. Somebody look up.

890
01:49:18,500 --> 01:49:24,500
The University of Texas School of Public Health, front of the Envelope Innovation Award.

891
01:49:24,500 --> 01:49:38,330
Oh, so it's in the acknowledgments section for who funded the study and stuff that I didn't do it again this year, but I did it last year.

892
01:49:38,330 --> 01:49:44,120
I would not normally look up funds like that, but because of the topic, I looked it up.

893
01:49:44,120 --> 01:49:55,400
Can you guys find with who is and again and that partially funded by the police force?

894
01:49:55,400 --> 01:50:04,640
I thought it had something that my recollection from last year was it had some kind of connection to the police and I of that.

895
01:50:04,640 --> 01:50:11,690
Yeah, I can't see your face on your body.

896
01:50:11,690 --> 01:50:17,450
So why do we worry about when the funders are the police force and you're studying police

897
01:50:17,450 --> 01:50:24,700
conflict of interest or if you have a little physical protection with the participants,

898
01:50:24,700 --> 01:50:33,050
which is something we should be capable of something.

899
01:50:33,050 --> 01:50:41,030
So it means that they're not mistreated the humans by doing this analysis, you know what the attribution.

900
01:50:41,030 --> 01:50:47,900
But before I, I don't think that I considers as a source of funding.

901
01:50:47,900 --> 01:50:50,120
So we have separate here at the University of Michigan.

902
01:50:50,120 --> 01:50:59,180
We have separate mechanisms for reporting our conflicts of interest than we do for human subjects.

903
01:50:59,180 --> 01:51:10,550
And I think the reality is, is that their funding source would not have changed the way in which the humans in this study were were being treated.

904
01:51:10,550 --> 01:51:18,110
I mean, it's like basically data after the fact that it's not late. It's not like you're asking for things from those people.

905
01:51:18,110 --> 01:51:24,200
But it does raise a question about the publication. Did you guys find that you can't find it?

906
01:51:24,200 --> 01:51:27,980
I did a quick look this morning and I thought I was crazy. But last year I looked it up.

907
01:51:27,980 --> 01:51:35,510
And I do believe that they had it was it was joint funding from the police and something else.

908
01:51:35,510 --> 01:51:46,910
But I mean, why would please. Department funded study because they want to know well, so that is the most generous look,

909
01:51:46,910 --> 01:51:52,820
is that the police want to know when they want to do better. I will hope that that is true.

910
01:51:52,820 --> 01:51:57,710
Well, one of the authors also coordinated with the government.

911
01:51:57,710 --> 01:52:06,070
You may remember better than that about the authors, Texas Health Science Center, University of South Florida Department of Criminology.

912
01:52:06,070 --> 01:52:14,810
Oh, yeah. There Steve and I. Bishop is with the Police Institute, Dallas Police Department, one of them.

913
01:52:14,810 --> 01:52:18,630
So which Patterson? Stephen Bishop. He's a middle author.

914
01:52:18,630 --> 01:52:23,090
So you may not have had a ton of control. He may have been the person who got them.

915
01:52:23,090 --> 01:52:44,480
The data interesting. He is also a fugitive and he couldn't get away from the contributors until he wrote something like the context.

916
01:52:44,480 --> 01:52:48,590
How many do you actually need people to be right involved in informing?

917
01:52:48,590 --> 01:52:54,890
The data says it's not it's not guaranteed that they have bias and want to change the results of the study.

918
01:52:54,890 --> 01:53:01,640
But it certainly gives me a moment of pause and fascinating that I can't find that this year, that it's that it was the police.

919
01:53:01,640 --> 01:53:06,680
Right. But I think it was the police in part that helped to fund it.

920
01:53:06,680 --> 01:53:15,470
So given the fact that it was partially funded by the police, that it was right, it was using that data set with its weakness,

921
01:53:15,470 --> 01:53:23,120
it was throwing out lethal force and firearms and are still some big differences.

922
01:53:23,120 --> 01:53:33,020
That's informative. It also shows you how valuable it is to be able to predict the directionality of bias,

923
01:53:33,020 --> 01:53:40,940
because if the bias I expected was to inflate those associations right, we would have had a really different opinion of the paper.

924
01:53:40,940 --> 01:53:51,020
But the fact that we're guessing it's going to get smaller, I certainly would be just popped into my head.

925
01:53:51,020 --> 01:54:00,860
I felt like to could good within seconds.

926
01:54:00,860 --> 01:54:13,160
So I think about the community report, which is here, that it initiated this in twenty thirteen and that this study was done for two years.

927
01:54:13,160 --> 01:54:17,660
Data after this is project initiation.

928
01:54:17,660 --> 01:54:25,490
So I was wondering if one of the participants from the studies work could be right.

929
01:54:25,490 --> 01:54:34,850
They could be figuring out how to do it better. They could want to be one of the best in the country and figure out how to improve the last.

930
01:54:34,850 --> 01:54:38,960
Oh, I don't know what the last thing I wanted to do was.

931
01:54:38,960 --> 01:54:49,820
So there were twenty six there are twenty six civilians who died in the hand in the custody of police.

932
01:54:49,820 --> 01:54:53,300
They said it was small. Yeah. Oh yeah.

933
01:54:53,300 --> 01:54:58,040
And I'm sure. So did you do any calculations.

934
01:54:58,040 --> 01:55:02,270
No I didn't. I just just from the first guy I just like that.

935
01:55:02,270 --> 01:55:09,860
OK, so here you go. Ready. OK, so there's one point three million people in Dallas.

936
01:55:09,860 --> 01:55:20,230
There were twenty six people who died across two years. So what's the rate?

937
01:55:20,230 --> 01:55:41,620
Twenty six. All right, with one point three million in two years, a record amount per hundred thousand year, could you guys get.

938
01:55:41,620 --> 01:55:46,370
I know I did.

939
01:55:46,370 --> 01:55:52,390
I thought I could have done it wrong. I thought I got almost one per hundred thousand person here.

940
01:55:52,390 --> 01:56:01,060
So I think I got 096 or something I dirham. It's totally possible I did the wrong one.

941
01:56:01,060 --> 01:56:07,630
Oh yeah I know how I got. So about one per hundred thousand person here.

942
01:56:07,630 --> 01:56:14,320
So then I went and looked up our mortality rates of different things and I was like how.

943
01:56:14,320 --> 01:56:19,570
What's the rate of that. And actually that's just in Dallas. Right.

944
01:56:19,570 --> 01:56:25,330
So I think what I found when I looked it up, it wasn't it wasn't nearly as much as some of our many things,

945
01:56:25,330 --> 01:56:30,850
but it was about 10 percent of our rate of suicide in the United States.

946
01:56:30,850 --> 01:56:39,790
Was death in police custody in Dallas.

947
01:56:39,790 --> 01:56:42,700
So I think if I if I looked right,

948
01:56:42,700 --> 01:56:50,590
I thought that the suicide rates in the United States are about 10 per hundred thousand or maybe a little bit bigger,

949
01:56:50,590 --> 01:56:54,250
something like that, mortality rates from suicide.

950
01:56:54,250 --> 01:57:02,410
And this was about one per hundred thousand. I mean, it wasn't as big against other things as it might be,

951
01:57:02,410 --> 01:57:06,640
but it's not true that every twenty six people that's 13 people a year dying in police

952
01:57:06,640 --> 01:57:17,440
custody and one cities like New York are going to be like police in our population.

953
01:57:17,440 --> 01:57:27,130
So what I was trying to figure out was within the area of Dallas, I'm assuming that there's not other folks.

954
01:57:27,130 --> 01:57:33,610
But you're right. Your question is, is is it right? I was looking at mortality rate in Dallas for the whole population.

955
01:57:33,610 --> 01:57:38,770
And you're saying what is the mortality rate per interaction?

956
01:57:38,770 --> 01:57:43,570
Almost like a case conditional upon you being arrested.

957
01:57:43,570 --> 01:57:51,070
What's your likelihood of died in police custody? So actually, what's the population of the United States?

958
01:57:51,070 --> 01:57:58,360
It's like three hundred. And I'm going to say to a million, billion, million or a million.

959
01:57:58,360 --> 01:58:03,070
So one per hundred thousand times.

960
01:58:03,070 --> 01:58:08,240
Three hundred million. My brain is not that strong.

961
01:58:08,240 --> 01:58:19,010
So that would be like third. That can't be right. That can't be right.

962
01:58:19,010 --> 01:58:26,860
Six thousand six thousand people are dying each if conditional upon the rates being equal

963
01:58:26,860 --> 01:58:32,020
everywhere in the United States or Dallas representing the average of the whole United States.

964
01:58:32,020 --> 01:58:38,480
That's 6000 people dying each year in the United States in police custody.

965
01:58:38,480 --> 01:58:48,550
Remember, that should be zero for a number. That should be zero. That is bonkers, Lihi.

966
01:58:48,550 --> 01:58:55,120
All right, public health professionals going to change the world better than the next generation.

967
01:58:55,120 --> 01:59:01,780
OK, let's take a short break and then we can talk briefly about your study design,

968
01:59:01,780 --> 01:59:05,290
if you want, for next week or it's also, you know what the truth is.

969
01:59:05,290 --> 01:59:11,980
It's also I wanted to have next week I tomorrow. If you guys want to go early, I don't mind either.

970
01:59:11,980 --> 01:59:19,960
You guys want to, but it's already done.

971
01:59:19,960 --> 01:59:26,200
OK, how about this? Since we often have a three hour class in the afternoon, which is really long, we break early today.

972
01:59:26,200 --> 01:59:30,340
If anyone wants to stick around and ask me questions that will be helpful for you for so long.

973
01:59:30,340 --> 01:59:36,860
I'm happy to, as I said, do my best to answer that question on the right.

974
01:59:36,860 --> 01:59:44,440
OK, just before we let you use just because I feel like maybe I was one that maybe your question for another week.

975
01:59:44,440 --> 01:59:49,660
So when you're saying, like, think about the relative measures, you're like from the tables here,

976
01:59:49,660 --> 01:59:53,740
but then when are you going to like what other groups or groups might you want to compare to?

977
01:59:53,740 --> 01:59:59,980
Are you saying like what we want to pick is like other reference groups or like what groups might you have been interested in?

978
01:59:59,980 --> 02:00:03,940
Right. So they compared the white white dyads to these other dialects.

979
02:00:03,940 --> 02:00:07,420
Like, is that the question that you would have posed if you have the data on it?

980
02:00:07,420 --> 02:00:13,000
OK, yeah, I'm going to try and be more precise in my questioning.

981
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:21,670
But if you have questions on my questions, just so just to clarify something like would you be interested in having like, say,

982
02:00:21,670 --> 02:00:26,350
the Hispanic Hispanic as the reference group or are you saying something totally

983
02:00:26,350 --> 02:00:31,750
different that isn't even I think I could do something different even on a table.

984
02:00:31,750 --> 02:00:36,250
So it's like what is really the comparison that you want?

985
02:00:36,250 --> 02:00:44,620
Like what if you are interested in the impact of race on police, what do you call it?

986
02:00:44,620 --> 02:00:53,150
Aggressive behavior, aggressive arrest or what would you what groups might you want to compare with?

987
02:00:53,150 --> 02:00:58,780
So it's asking a lot more questions that you want to ask and then.

988
02:00:58,780 --> 02:01:04,660
Right. But but but mean in terms of those groups. And you can justify why does that not make any sense?

989
02:01:04,660 --> 02:01:10,900
When I first read it, I thought you remember the reference group for the outcome, not the explosion itself.

990
02:01:10,900 --> 02:01:15,580
So the reference group here, they're comparing to.

991
02:01:15,580 --> 02:01:19,000
Yeah, they're usually comparing to white flight, right?

992
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:27,310
Yeah, I was reading it as like the reference group for the outcome, comparing that car, whatever to everything else.

993
02:01:27,310 --> 02:01:32,350
Oh, you could have done that too. OK, they are open ended questions.

994
02:01:32,350 --> 02:01:36,100
I will give you credit if anything you say makes obvious sense.

995
02:01:36,100 --> 02:01:44,980
The one thing that does get tricky, as I sort of said to some of you, as if if I ask you like what might be a problem with this.

996
02:01:44,980 --> 02:01:50,830
And there's like one thing that is huge, a huge, huge, huge problem, that there's one thing that's like a minuscule problem.

997
02:01:50,830 --> 02:02:01,930
Even if this minuscule problem is well reasoned, you may not get full points because you missed the elephant in the room.

998
02:02:01,930 --> 02:02:13,230
OK, Rock, good luck on your test tomorrow on. Lefthander.

999
02:02:13,230 --> 02:02:22,440
Nobody looks at your transcripts like this when we take a pregnancy exam, something like see your grades.

1000
02:02:22,440 --> 02:02:28,860
So the only reason that we would look at your grades is if you do not do well in the competency exam.

1001
02:02:28,860 --> 02:02:34,110
We're trying to figure out how to support you going forward the other way in which your grades are noticed,

1002
02:02:34,110 --> 02:02:41,880
as if if you're bombing or like AP math classes, then somebody will probably contact you and say, hi, how can we help?

1003
02:02:41,880 --> 02:02:46,740
What happened? You know, you are ready. That will be how we will contact you.

1004
02:02:46,740 --> 02:02:52,290
And I have no problem with change that.

1005
02:02:52,290 --> 02:02:56,280
Yeah, and she had to submit her transcript. Yes, I know.

1006
02:02:56,280 --> 02:03:04,650
I know. She had agreed on. Yes. But yeah, it was.

1007
02:03:04,650 --> 02:03:12,840
I don't know about this, maybe I swear to after it was really it was very upsetting.

1008
02:03:12,840 --> 02:03:22,120
Yeah, it was really weird. I don't know, maybe it was a different type of just pages and science relevant class from undergrad and undergrad.

1009
02:03:22,120 --> 02:03:30,060
Think that's what I think America is to say.

1010
02:03:30,060 --> 02:03:34,710
She said, I know she got my message. That's right.

1011
02:03:34,710 --> 02:03:45,030
Your career, you're trying to get mastery of the subject matter. Not a good grade that you're going for mastery and not a pat on the back.

1012
02:03:45,030 --> 02:03:52,080
Well, you see that sort of look.

1013
02:03:52,080 --> 02:03:58,213
All right. I'm not a killer. Oh, thank you.
