1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:08,580
E we are. I still have a little bit of like a cough, so.

2
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:14,220
But I'm testing COVID negative, so have a mask a little longer there.

3
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:17,940
Just so you guys know, I don't know if people have been taking informal polls or whatever,

4
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,390
but among the faculty, everybody's like, are people masking you masking?

5
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:27,500
You know, we're all operating in that sort of still semi uncertainty.

6
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:33,890
But once I don't have a Cos cos I will, I'd be happy to unmask.

7
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:44,000
But for now I'll just try to project. So thanks for responding to the Little and the Soul Baby videos.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:54,030
Read and respond. And for those of you I reviewed, I tend to review till about 11:00 if and then I do a bunch of email right before class.

9
00:00:54,050 --> 00:01:04,490
So for those of you who turned it in and didn't get comments from me, I'll look and the comments afterwards, probably later tonight.

10
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:12,560
But yeah, I think people made some good observations so we can talk about those in class and we'll

11
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,090
also talk about just what they mentioned on that science and the video and the readings.

12
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:25,580
And in the mini lecture I really focused on like here are kind of the milestones of infant development in these different domains,

13
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:33,470
and we'll kind of go through those domains again as we keep moving through, you know, different developmental stages.

14
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:40,910
Today, what I want to also really do is talk about temperament and attachment, which are two big kind of constructs.

15
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:45,290
We've talked a little bit about attachment already. Temperament is another big one.

16
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:51,620
And they're really important for understanding kind of individual variation among kids, individual differences.

17
00:01:52,790 --> 00:02:00,440
And so that Milestones lecture is really like, you know, here's the sort of stages of development across these different domains.

18
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:06,979
And then the individual difference pieces like the red lines in that graph about motor development.

19
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:11,450
So how do you kind of, you know, proceed on your own developmental trajectory?

20
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:23,720
But before we start before I start talking more, do you guys have questions or comments on the the Milestones lecture, anything that seemed confusing?

21
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:33,200
I think I've mentioned I rewatched most of those. Sometimes I watch them on fast talking.

22
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,319
So you guys might do that, too? I don't know.

23
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:41,000
I understand all that students do that, which makes me a little anxious for the future of medicine.

24
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:49,850
Okay. But anything seemed like, you know, that I kind of try to put the mini lectures around topics that are like,

25
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:56,000
here's a bunch of information, but, you know, always bring up questions and comments.

26
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,310
And it's sort of a good grounding to make sure we're all on the same page relatively.

27
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:08,180
So no burning questions at the moment. So we could talk about the videos.

28
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,149
I always want to point out those videos that you guys watched for the written response

29
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:17,570
are videos from a research study and the parents did give their consent to be shown.

30
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:28,209
Those kids now are probably like. They're probably born in around 11, 2011, 2012.

31
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:30,100
So they could be like little ten year olds now.

32
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:37,480
It is always interesting to think about these kids that I've sort of watched so many times for various research purposes.

33
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:42,400
But what did you guys think about that?

34
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,130
Sort of? I feel like the very dramatic title, The Science of Neglect.

35
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:53,450
Some people kind of, Cross commented. Also in the baby videos about things that they said in this video.

36
00:03:55,820 --> 00:04:04,310
But if people think about that one and I always like to ask, is there anything new that came out for people that they hadn't considered before?

37
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:10,190
Because it all kind of known things that people had thought of before.

38
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:14,900
Yeah. And then can you say your name? Oh, just so we all know that.

39
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:19,040
Okay. That's.

40
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:24,069
They served each you. Yeah, I know.

41
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:30,910
When I played with. Uh huh.

42
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:38,930
I think that is. I mean, I think that's why that's why I say it's a little bit of a dramatic title.

43
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:44,149
It's like very short experience and must take every single moment of opportunity to interact.

44
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:48,260
And like you guys know now, having been baby detective,

45
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:54,890
like you can see if you're watching in a video a lot of these little moments, but we don't need to respond to every single moment.

46
00:04:55,010 --> 00:05:00,290
Right. And so I think they also did make that point. But it is developmentally, I think, interesting.

47
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:04,579
Thank you for that observation that like this does happen really early on.

48
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:12,680
And if you're like an early, you know, like a young baby watcher, you can kind of, you know, these little signs.

49
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:19,640
I think you're like clear maybe then often from older kids.

50
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:27,220
Number of people know that language like emerging language, is sort of a challenge.

51
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:35,920
And I would say, yes, 10,000%. Right. Like even the parent of one child who has a lot of time to spend with that child.

52
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:39,760
They don't understand their child's emerging language like from the beginning.

53
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,980
And so that's really an important thing to kind of keep in mind the process.

54
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:50,440
Not clear what their little desires are in a lot of cases.

55
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:57,510
And the other. Yep.

56
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:02,910
Was also for all of us, I think. I thought. This culvert.

57
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:07,080
And even after culvert, there's been a big transition in working to working from home.

58
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:24,650
You spend more time with their kids. But if you're glued to your computer. Those that I know, like my friend.

59
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:29,040
It's really exciting. New lives are improving here, too.

60
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:38,860
So that might. So if the requests are being ignored by the primary caregiver instead of a baby sitter.

61
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:50,809
That is such a good point. Right? It's sort of like it's maybe more jarring if your parents there, but then they're sort of blank or blocked.

62
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:54,140
And we'll talk more about like a specific example of that one too, that sort of base.

63
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,479
But yeah, absolutely.

64
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:03,500
I think about that in terms of the work from home explosion that happened with COVID, if people were lucky, they got to work from home,

65
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:08,800
but it opened up all this kind of like strange interaction and non interactions, space, right,

66
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:16,970
between families and certainly like little, you know, experience that they know some of them.

67
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:25,280
And so how is that sort of back to that idea of like how how are we all shaped by this major, major global pandemic event?

68
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,620
That's certainly something to consider in terms of what that those early interactions may look like.

69
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:37,610
At the same time, they may have you know, you can do a lot with relatively little interaction, I'll say.

70
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:41,839
So they may have been less impacted than like fourth graders who are supposed to

71
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,380
be learning how to interact with peers and get some didn't get to see peers.

72
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:51,880
So, you know. There. Jackie.

73
00:07:52,730 --> 00:08:01,710
Now, this thinking I didn't write somebody, that sort of thing, but now I'm thinking about how even for some of the parent or serving or like,

74
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:07,220
you know, didn't actually return or if they're not serving, whether the parent was engaged or not.

75
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,370
Like if they are engaged and they aren't returning or serving.

76
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:15,260
What does that mean? Like developmentally? Is it just like personality?

77
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:21,640
Not. Rain or what it could potentially be.

78
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,850
Yes, sir. Oh, I was just going to kind of go off the last two points.

79
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:33,889
You say that I feel like it puts a lot of pressure on the parent of like like when Jackie was just saying,

80
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:39,320
like, they're giving, but they're not receiving. And like, as a parent, I could be like, what am I doing wrong?

81
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:44,709
Or like the whole the whole thing. Where you have that physical boundary of going to work.

82
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:49,360
And I was like, okay, I have to work. But I also like what I'm.

83
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:01,490
I want to spend time on my truck or watch a video like this and I get super stressed out.

84
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:05,060
But I'm not spending every single moment like serving and returning with my child.

85
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:11,360
So I think that I want to places like that kind of video and sort of all of this deep.

86
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:17,469
It's been really, really tiny detail in that bigger context.

87
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:24,400
But like, you know, life is hopefully long and like lots of parent, parent child interaction can happen.

88
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:29,020
And so that idea of like missing a single moment, that's okay.

89
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,870
All right. Like, it's okay to not respond to every single moment.

90
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:39,150
It's a horrible, like, intervention technique with parents who maybe haven't thought about meeting these tiny.

91
00:09:42,960 --> 00:10:09,280
I'm just thinking about how the. All the things that come with me.

92
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:32,809
Yeah. So. And a few people referenced this in that in that in that sort of final prompt comment, parents may have like the things going on out here,

93
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:35,840
out at that far level of the social ecological model like work,

94
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:41,360
stress or finances or other big picture things that may be like seeping in to their behavior.

95
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:47,870
They may also have this like immediate in your face of three kids there that, you know, have divided attention.

96
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:53,070
And I think both of those things are really important as well.

97
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:58,700
I think at least one person mentioned. What about kids like when kids are different ages.

98
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:05,000
Right. And so, like, are you worried about like keeping this toddler from like bonking their head in the table?

99
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,620
Or are you trying to, like, you know, teach their fourth graders some lessons?

100
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:14,480
Or are you leaving the fourth grade alone because they're not going about their head? And, you know, like, how do you manage those things?

101
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:18,829
That's a lot to juggle. Yeah. Also, like that's interesting.

102
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:24,319
You brought up like other kids, too. Like I remember in one of the videos, there was like an older brother also playing with the kids.

103
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,820
So how is that like we talk a lot about the parents and guardians, but how do other siblings?

104
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:37,589
That that even is a thing. I don't know. Mm hmm. Absolutely.

105
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:44,310
And so for any of us in here who've had siblings or siblings ask people in their lives like that, that's an influence, right?

106
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:50,260
Like that's a that's an influence that a lot of us could probably reflect on. Or cousins peer to peer AIDS people.

107
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:58,890
And I think that it's it's one of those things like it's really fascinating because a lot of people have lived experience with like peers,

108
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:02,730
you know, growing up and siblings. It's really hard to study.

109
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:06,120
For lots of reasons we can imagine to like, well, what if it's older? Younger?

110
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,139
What if it's boy? Girl, how many? 800 years apart.

111
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:13,050
And people always want to. What's the ideal, you know, distance apart for.

112
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:21,829
It's so complex, right? It's like the ultimate complex system within a complex family system.

113
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:25,350
So I think it's always important to kind of keep in mind with, you know,

114
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:34,820
we talk broadly about families and we certainly talk a lot about parents and parenting, but being careful not to like guilt, overly guilt parents.

115
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:44,240
And then also we'll talk a little bit here today about like alternate models for kind of child socialization and early child rearing stuff.

116
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:50,720
So yeah, so I think it's really fun to kind of start with this like very intensive work

117
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,140
and have you guys be able to like pluck out these little moments of interaction.

118
00:12:55,010 --> 00:13:01,159
And it is the basis for some of the interventions we'll talk about, but also just to kind of provide that bigger picture.

119
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:08,600
Like we're not going in saying like, you know, maximize every moment or your child is, you know, do like that's not what we're thinking.

120
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:15,440
But I think that can get I mean, I'm sort of joking, but like it's kind of an important because I think that's a very important message

121
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:21,679
because there's so much recent attention to adverse early childhood cancers.

122
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,950
We'll talk about, you know, parenting, the importance of the first three years of life.

123
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:32,660
Those are all really important. We can do a lot of interventions around that, but we don't want to get in a parent blaming business.

124
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:38,239
And if you're in the parenting intervention business, it's often considered like a parent blaming business.

125
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,650
So I think that's important to just like keep keep it actively in mind.

126
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:56,040
Okay. Oh, one other thing. And I started some notes from some people's comments and a few things that I haven't noted so well.

127
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:59,780
We can talk about the differences between the three videos. A lot of people notice those.

128
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:07,490
And also so what did you guys think about the differences in the videos between like parent behaviors,

129
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:12,110
child behaviors and the types of toys that they were engaging with?

130
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:16,670
Did anybody want to reflect on those those things?

131
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:21,580
This is really getting minute details. But yeah, Emily, I feel like some.

132
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:32,360
Other that serve in the spotlight, especially with the car or something with mobility that back and forth that it.

133
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:53,370
And that felt more like. Know how to make room with a car.

134
00:14:53,820 --> 00:15:00,140
She was doing some nice like of that imitative behavior that we talked about with the phone.

135
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:03,809
And I had that phone voice like going, which nobody does this anymore.

136
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:07,200
But what else about that?

137
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:14,610
Yeah. So like, I think I wrote in someone's response to like this idea, it's called affordances.

138
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:17,219
We talk about it a little bit now more. It's kind of interesting.

139
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:22,680
It's like a perceptual theory of development and like what's out there in the world and how does that influence your development?

140
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:28,170
Comes up a lot with toy types and thinking about like electronic toys.

141
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:34,290
When you like press one button and it does all kinds of things that aren't really connected to your button press.

142
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:40,110
Like what does that mean for child development and particularly development like causality in the world?

143
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:49,260
So toys that are more like simple and require sort of more child engagement can have more of a beneficial.

144
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:52,470
That's kind of why they have a more beneficial effect on development.

145
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:57,480
That's not to say, like every child must have like wooden, unpainted, you know,

146
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:03,510
that's certainly like been taken to its extreme, I would say, by like the toy designer or toy industry, right?

147
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:08,220
Like if you're buying, you know, it's going to be bad.

148
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:13,650
That's not all the case. But that's why that sort of idea between like, you know,

149
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:19,640
press a button and toy does lots of things versus like you have to manipulate something to make the toy work.

150
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:22,650
Those are very different kinds of toys that stimulate development. Definitely.

151
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:30,540
Yeah. And I'm working in a study right now. Oh, yeah.

152
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:41,670
And you can. They like aren't used to having toys that don't make a lot of noise or aren't going to.

153
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:57,040
Great point. It's so it's really true.

154
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:07,299
And you just watch a lot of these videos and certain toys evoke like have more affordances of gosh, this isn't going to do anything by itself.

155
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:15,070
I got to do something to make it interesting or engaging and make it an interaction versus like out, oh, look at that.

156
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:20,740
I keep doing like this. And of course, like, you know, now we have everything touchable pads, right?

157
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:28,450
So we'll talk about that. But it's a really different context and really rapidly different to for kids and for parents.

158
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:36,879
And so thinking about that was already all going on, sort of the movement towards more electronic based toys and then copied, right?

159
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,380
So what a better way to entertain a child who's home by them, by themselves,

160
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:47,020
but with a parent than with an electronic toy or a movie or something delivered by a screen.

161
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:56,250
My mom was. She's amazing.

162
00:17:56,420 --> 00:18:04,890
She. Really?

163
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:11,620
Yeah. And like, we always have these choices, right? And like, how to shape those environments and other people.

164
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:19,000
Another thing people talk about a lot is, of course, like face time and, you know, relatives who, you know, don't live in the environment.

165
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:21,430
Like, that's amazing to be able to have that right.

166
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:31,150
I did not have that in my kids and my parents are far and I would like send I remember burning like a CD of photos and sending it.

167
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:38,050
Right. So like because I'm old. But that was like a way to kind of bring this immediacy of kid.

168
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:50,280
One other note about and we can we'll talk soon to talk more about media and shifts in media.

169
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:58,620
But one feature that we talk about a lot and kind of media effects type research is the autoplay feature, which,

170
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:05,070
you know, we all, I would argue, probably struggle to like manage because it's there and it just keeps coming.

171
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:06,450
But if you think about it,

172
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:18,329
kids have that to write all of the stuff that we struggle with with media life kids have because it's in all mostly kids facing education,

173
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:19,770
even if they're labeled educational.

174
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:29,580
And so it's these features and things like a DVD that kind of had a stopping point that doesn't really exist anymore.

175
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:33,899
And so there's no sort of artificial stopping point, you know, or another.

176
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,210
No, like physical stopping point.

177
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:43,230
And so the parent usually or babysitter or whoever has to come in and like stop that thing that might just be rolling on.

178
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:48,000
So it's a real it's a really different demand from like, Oh, I'm so sorry that DVD ended.

179
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:49,799
What happens when the DVD ends?

180
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:57,450
Like, then you can promise you can use that as like a routine prompt, but in the case of autoplay, unless you turn it off, you can't.

181
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:01,110
So there's so much to think about around that and around media.

182
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:10,770
Let's see. Anything else? Anything around the mom, the second mom in the video with the phone or with the phone?

183
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:15,900
Did people notice anything else in that video in particular or other thoughts?

184
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:23,180
Yeah. Yeah. Jennifer. Yeah. You know, I just. She seemed like.

185
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:32,459
So she had like there was like some attempts to try to engage the baby, but the baby seemed very engaged in the phone.

186
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:37,380
So she kind of like didn't put too much effort into the child because I was thinking like,

187
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:41,940
what if she had tried to take someone away and like engage with the other toys because no, the baby can't see the phone.

188
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:44,150
Like, how would that have changed the interaction?

189
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:49,139
But I think like that would just bring me back to some of the comments people were making about like when parents are busier,

190
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:55,470
it just seems easier to like give them the phone because of the baby's like. So with that and then you don't have to worry so much about engaging.

191
00:20:55,710 --> 00:21:01,500
Yeah, but I think like I never thought about it in the developmental aspect about like, how useful it is to have those interactions.

192
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:05,130
Mm hmm. Just. Just like your mentor.

193
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:09,270
And then they keep them busy. They're not crying, so. Yeah, yes, absolutely.

194
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:12,450
Yes. Yes. That is that's like the ultimate, ultimate challenge.

195
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:20,100
And I think I want to point out that Mom, too, and I don't know, like her score on the depression measures and stuff like that,

196
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:24,270
but that kind of more like you mentioned, the body positioning.

197
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:32,219
So, you know, she what she what she didn't do was like move around me face to face with the baby.

198
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:36,750
And then she made some attempts but sort of, you know, sent in to kind of give up.

199
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:40,739
And those are kinds of things that we might look for that could indicate,

200
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:45,479
like the mom is having depression or feeling like she can't engage with the baby.

201
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:50,990
So again, not an extreme example, but just like again, in these little moments, she might have been tired, you know?

202
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,080
But those are kinds of things that we like to point out in some of these videos.

203
00:21:56,670 --> 00:22:01,889
And then, oh, one other thing I was going to note for people who like commented on the emerging

204
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:05,010
language piece and are interested in learning that kind of language stuff,

205
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:11,700
one of the things that comes up and kind of in mid infancy that's really can be really powerful

206
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:15,870
in terms of engaging and understanding kids is teaching sign language like just simple,

207
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:23,370
simple science that there's a lot of books around and it's sort of like baby signs is the the terminology that people use.

208
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:29,820
And why do you guys think that might be helpful for like parents, busy parents, other parents.

209
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:56,780
And so I'm also kind of off the bat thinking about the first video.

210
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:15,670
Yeah. Absolutely.

211
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:22,059
And thinking about it, like the more time you try to kind of read those baby signs, like she knew he wanted something, she just kept she was trying.

212
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:28,750
She was like offering. But then the more that the baby will be able to communicate and then the baby will sort of be like,

213
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:31,809
oh, I have again, like kind of causality over the world.

214
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:36,910
Like when I communicate something, it is meant ultimately by my environment.

215
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:41,110
And so that's a sort of empowering, you know, part of development.

216
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:50,020
And then also it can help really avoid things like big tantrums when you don't, you know, you're not kind of getting what the baby is wanting.

217
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:56,200
Certainly there will be big tantrums. That's just part of like infancy and toddlerhood, like they're just are.

218
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:01,569
But this idea of being able to teach simple science and we think about it too, with like eating behavior.

219
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:06,130
So more and more like sign, like all done, like those are really good signs.

220
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:14,500
You're very simple. I remember being very grateful to daycare, helping to teach and reinforce those signs because it really was great.

221
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:19,270
I had a what we'll talk about temperament. One of my children is like a really intense temperament.

222
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:25,900
And I was like, Oh, I'm so glad I might have some additional tools to try to figure out what the heck she is wanting at the moment.

223
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:32,230
Okay, so thinking about now, we did the video.

224
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,559
That video showed the still face a little bit. Right.

225
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:43,700
So you guys saw. Soon. You guys saw this video of there interacting.

226
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:49,920
You kind of put this like artificial stop in the middle and then the baby does a ton of stuff, right.

227
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:57,440
To get back that that parent's attention. So I think that's kind of a cool moral manipulation.

228
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,110
But to show like, hey, these babies are like wanting all this.

229
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:08,719
And then they also show like what we call like the, you know, reparation or re-engagement or reunion part.

230
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:16,790
And that's where people get really excited to look at like relationship quality and how it shows what kind of relationship this Dyad might have.

231
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:23,510
And can we be obsessed with this pretty small interaction to see like, oh, can they repair this disrupted interaction?

232
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:28,250
That's like a big thing and is parenting interventions because we all have disrupted interactions.

233
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:34,430
And this study, it's now it's from 2018, but they tried it out with a phone.

234
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:40,970
Right. So that's a disrupted interaction that we are all increasingly used to right in our lives.

235
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:49,729
No longer odd to see somebody like change their behavior dramatically by going like this or like walk around in

236
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:57,080
the street gesticulating and have an earbud in to those used to be sort of signals that were like odd behaviors,

237
00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:05,659
but now they're much more commonplace. And so thinking about how do they impact development because they're sort of let's you see,

238
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:08,840
somebody has a phone or you can intuit that they have a earbud in.

239
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:12,770
You might wonder, like, why are they acting? There's nothing that's causing that action.

240
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:18,260
And so anyway, here, this was one of the early studies there have since been some more.

241
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:26,869
Just looking at the really important question of like how does it how does like screen use by parents when the infant is there?

242
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:35,990
And if anybody has witnessed this, sometimes, you know, kids can get pretty assertive, I would say, about like wanting the attention from the parent.

243
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,600
Like they can go take the parent's phone and they can pull their hand down.

244
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:45,260
Or if anybody like my dog does this with me on my thing and like jump up and like, lie on my laptop, right?

245
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:51,560
I'm like, fake. No, I'm trying to do something that is very obviously like, I need your face attention.

246
00:26:52,280 --> 00:27:01,519
So infants are good at sensing this. And what this study shows, too, is that the more that parents self-reported devices,

247
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:05,570
which we know inaccurate way to measure devices, we all probably underreport.

248
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:13,399
But now there are studies that have like replicated these kinds of things more, you know, with like time tracking device use apps.

249
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:19,100
And it's really pretty fascinating in terms of what we're finding out.

250
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:22,360
But basically this was a simple study that looked at, you know,

251
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:31,070
parents self-reported device use was associated with, okay, so for device use, this is the reunion phase.

252
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:34,940
Are you or the re-engagement phase after this, this phone interruption,

253
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:42,440
parents who use more devices habitually, those kids are engaged less with the parent at the reunion part.

254
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:50,719
So you know this, you know, if this happens over and over and over and over again, like the elderly kind of learn a little bit,

255
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:59,330
maybe like that kid on video to I'm like, all right, well, I'm not going to get much reward when this, you know, the parent gives off the device.

256
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:04,190
So maybe I'll just go like amuse myself, right. To some degree.

257
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:13,620
Like, that's pretty adept. Yourself and you can like soothe your distress and things, but, you know, not all the time.

258
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:18,629
And so I think that that part about serving return interactions with parent and

259
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:23,130
with a responsive parent are really ideal for fostering this positive development.

260
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:26,610
And. Across a lot of domains.

261
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:34,590
So yeah, so I am involved with some research that's like in this vein.

262
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:36,389
So if people are interested in this kind of thing,

263
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:41,060
like how do we like manipulate around and see what's happening with devices and kids and parent behavior?

264
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:43,260
And I'm happy to talk more about that. Yeah. Yeah.

265
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:48,590
I was just going to say the labs are working like works on this stuff and I think it's so interesting like that.

266
00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:13,170
Design of use that technology. True.

267
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:16,500
And it really I mean, like. Yes.

268
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:23,489
I mean, it's it's kind of hard to, like, sit with and I think it's hard for, you know, I think all of that and generalizing.

269
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:26,220
But I would imagine all of us have been, you know, had this moment where you're like,

270
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:29,580
I gotta put my phone down or like I got to try to limit in some way.

271
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:35,160
Right. And that's really hard, I think, because also thinking about interventions,

272
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:40,829
we all want to like develop, you know, mobile tech app based interventions too.

273
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:48,930
And like there's really awesome power as we know too in technology and in our phones and like how do we balance all of that?

274
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:55,079
And I think the other thing with phones and just kind of the business of life, you know,

275
00:29:55,080 --> 00:30:02,940
in terms of tech companies for entertainment, but also like reading the news or various other newspaper could be entertainment,

276
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:09,630
but like lots of different tasks that we're all doing that are screen mediated and like to a kid,

277
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:18,930
especially to a pre-verbal kid you can't explain to, they might be just sort of being like, Wow, they're always just doing this.

278
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:21,599
And as the parent, you might be thinking like, well,

279
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:27,809
scheduling your playdates and ordering this and and getting dinner and that the turn call in an Uber but like the

280
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:34,740
kid doesn't see that and I think some interventions have talked about like trying to narrate that stuff more.

281
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:43,049
Turning off apps that are like emotionally disruptive, like during certain hours where you might be interacting with your kid, that kind of thing.

282
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:47,520
So there's maybe a lot we can do, but I think it is thinking about like, um,

283
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:53,160
big picture interventions like with industry partnerships and that kind of thing that could maybe.

284
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:26,370
As a parent. Yeah. Right. Right. Yes.

285
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:29,680
And and we're going to talk about alo parenting.

286
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:33,730
It's sort of like a term for this kind of idea of the village.

287
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:39,190
But also think about COVID and think about being a new parent during COVID.

288
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:46,050
And like, you couldn't have people in your house again if you were like, lucky to be able to have a house and to be, have,

289
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:53,110
you know, this baby and stay home, etc. But like the amount of people that could have been in your village really kind of shrunk.

290
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,829
At least for an intensive amount of time there.

291
00:31:56,830 --> 00:32:07,150
And so that idea of I'm really on my own as a parent, I think in this cohort of people who had like a especially a first baby during COVID,

292
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:12,540
that's a really intense experience, I think, to go through. Absolutely.

293
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:20,660
I think there's a lot of really fascinating. Oh.

294
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:36,449
Be thinking about kind of switching a little bit to the readings and this idea of, you know, intervention and supporting patterns,

295
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:42,120
figuring out ways that we can provide help for parents who are kind of maybe struggling

296
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:49,140
with a lot of these different challenges as we've been talking about what to think about.

297
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:56,520
These are both sort of articles really written about the attrition or focus on that space,

298
00:32:57,570 --> 00:33:03,450
which is an undeniably important space for early development in particular,

299
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:09,600
or a few weeks about like vaccinations and the amount of interactions that you have with your pediatrician ideally.

300
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:15,990
But I also like to point out, you know, not everybody is going to their pediatrician.

301
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:20,219
There are some barriers that exist to going to your pediatrician.

302
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:26,580
And not all pediatricians are sort of trained to like thinking this way and this, I would say like a kind of a public healthy way.

303
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:35,730
And they're more, you know, as their training is more on the sort of medical side of development.

304
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:46,500
And then this is always, always a question that like to have this classroom use on like what other settings might be.

305
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:52,980
What about as places to provide supports for parents and certain.

306
00:33:55,590 --> 00:34:04,920
So any thoughts or comments on these readings or e to this idea of the kind of pediatric medical home?

307
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:09,000
Yeah. Yes. But a more definitive.

308
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:12,420
Sure. Like explanation to pediatric medical homes that would have.

309
00:34:15,910 --> 00:34:19,000
So it's really it's sort of a specific meeting.

310
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,750
And I think that the article is talking about like family based pediatric medical homes.

311
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:24,339
But basically,

312
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:36,010
it's the idea that you are receiving your medical care as a young as a family with a kid in a place where there are other services available.

313
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:38,379
So like a food pantry is going to be also there.

314
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:45,250
Behavioral health services are also there, like not only a pediatric clinic for like a well-child visit or vaccination.

315
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:51,370
And so the idea that it's not a totally like wraparound clinic,

316
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:59,020
but it's got more in that physical space than just quote unquote, just your pediatrician.

317
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:04,900
So, for example, if you're a pediatrician in the well-child visit says, oh, your child is like scoring.

318
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:09,730
They wouldn't say it this way. They're like, I have some concerns about your child's language development.

319
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:18,100
Maybe why don't we walk down the hall and we'll meet up with the special needs services and early

320
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:24,190
intervention that are also based in this physical space that's really trying to remove a barrier from.

321
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:27,219
You hear that meeting with the pediatrician.

322
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:30,879
You may get all stressed out as a parent like, oh my gosh, I have concerns with my child's language development.

323
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:36,600
What does that mean? They gave me this phone number I need to call it and never call anybody on the phone.

324
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:46,200
You know, all kinds of things that could ensue and that parent may be like never get the services that were recommended.

325
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:50,110
So that's our one reason for it. Yeah.

326
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:55,000
Okay, that's clear. Yeah. Like an example of working.

327
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:09,250
It was happening at the school. All these services were happening through this.

328
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:15,130
Children were showing up? Yep, absolutely.

329
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:21,250
And you said elementary school. So that's an even a little bit older age range than typical.

330
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:25,630
Like sometimes in preschool, that's a little more typical. There's much more like family.

331
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:34,000
Again, ideally family school connection in that preschool early, early child era, but less as you get further into the school system.

332
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:43,140
So that's great. Well, I think that people have perceptions.

333
00:36:57,070 --> 00:37:03,410
Wrong or wrong with them. I think it also means that only if you're integrated.

334
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:11,150
What? Where you know, people that you know or.

335
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:22,780
That's my and I. Yes. I didn't say these are ideally gone community placed.

336
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:23,190
Right.

337
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:30,420
So in a community environment where it's easy for people to get that back and forth, you know, like going into a big hospital, that might be freaky.

338
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:33,879
Yeah. Yeah. I have a question.

339
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:40,570
Actually, when I was delve into like early intervention and it was talking about individuals with Disabilities Education Act elements.

340
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:46,170
It talks about how the intervention services are mandated for like certain areas.

341
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:49,870
And it just started making me think it was like mandated.

342
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:55,840
And then it probably backs like the mandates on my community, but then also the pool.

343
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:58,870
Is it free? I was like, what exactly is covered under that?

344
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:04,610
I then. So the provider and the parent or caregiver.

345
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:10,880
And what I don't know what those services being mandated became.

346
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:19,759
Yes. Yes. So we will definitely get more into early intervention and some of that in one of the future sessions.

347
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:32,540
But broadly speaking, yes, you're keying into something that's a big, big system for parents to figure out early intervention.

348
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:40,310
And they're trying to be as connected as possible to places where kids are like preschools and pediatrician offices.

349
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:49,549
But what our fight comes up for depends on what state you live in, what county you live in, and what access you have to.

350
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:54,500
These services can be also driven by those those factors.

351
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:59,659
And so we will get more into that early intervention piece.

352
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:04,280
But yes, it's basically connected to screenings that happen.

353
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:09,450
So if those screenings don't happen, then you may not find out, you know,

354
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:13,790
if you qualify for, say, speech, which is something that develops pretty early,

355
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:20,959
think about those milestones and you can detect if someone's speech is not proceeding on track earlier than if you can,

356
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:25,490
then you can detect some motor development, certain early developmental indicators.

357
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:34,160
So yeah, we will definitely delve more into that. And I think the other thing to note here, we'll talk more about this as well.

358
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:42,530
But sometimes like the pediatrician or the early interventionists, they also in speaking mandates or mandated reporter of child abuse.

359
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:51,680
So on the one hand, that's really you want to have people who are looking out for the safety of children.

360
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:58,670
And so if they see a child come in who has signs of child abuse, it's important that that gets attended to.

361
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:05,360
We also know that the system, the child protective system, because various different names in different states,

362
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:09,440
but basically that's a system with a lot it's overburdened.

363
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:16,849
It's got a lot of historical racism embedded in it, and there's a lot of issues with the Child Protective Services.

364
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:26,690
And so that is a big barrier potentially for people going to the pediatrician or preschool teachers are also mandated reporters.

365
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:33,680
And we'll delve more into this, but it can be hard to tell, right, what's going on with a child.

366
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:37,969
They're pre-verbal. They might have a bruise. Did they fall down?

367
00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:46,040
What exactly happened? So it is like a deep, deep subspecialty to be a child abuse trained pediatrician to detect that.

368
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:52,160
And again back to access. Not everybody has access to that to.

369
00:40:54,230 --> 00:41:00,320
So. To be here. But one of the, I think good things about pediatric medical home.

370
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:03,020
Ideally, if it's community based and placed,

371
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:11,150
is that it can be more connected and there can be more understanding of families that are going to that pediatric medical home and the providers.

372
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:16,060
Could ideally even be from those communities.

373
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:19,719
So often a lot of things.

374
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:25,720
But I think that that's. And like that article a lot because it sort of allows people to look through and say like, okay,

375
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:31,780
these are the different things that might exist in that pediatric medical home setting and keeping our like public health hats on.

376
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:37,990
Like what other how could we maybe get some of those things into other settings?

377
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:43,240
Right. And so elementary schools or another type of setting school settings.

378
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:53,910
Okay. Another setting I love to bring up is libraries because thinking about certainly like early reading or early education stuff,

379
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:58,650
you can do a lot in libraries, often a lot of young families in libraries.

380
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:09,370
Okay. All right.

381
00:42:09,370 --> 00:42:13,180
Well, we'll come back to a lot of these issues, so I'll move quickly.

382
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:18,009
This is this point about the domains. Probably some of these.

383
00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:24,370
But just to reiterate, and it relates to what I was just saying about screening and like it's kind of hard sometimes

384
00:42:24,370 --> 00:42:27,909
to figure out what's going on with a little kid because they're developing rapidly.

385
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:32,920
They're a little and even they may be able to like really fast, but their speech is delayed,

386
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:38,170
so they may be able to like get away from the parent quickly, but then like they can express their needs.

387
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:42,159
And so when they can't express their needs and they're frustrated, then they might run, you know,

388
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:47,739
so like you can see how these domains that are just developing within an individual that

389
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:52,940
interacts and that shapes kind of the nature of the parent child interaction and the type.

390
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:01,410
Back to this, too, when we talk about childhood injury.

391
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:06,160
But it's also really important to keep in mind when we're thinking about injury prevention,

392
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:08,850
like how all these different domains of development go together.

393
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:14,399
So like cognition, knowing, like I should stop, remember that visual clip, for example?

394
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:20,010
Like I should stop before I go over the cliff. But my motor development is like rocking and I'm really fast,

395
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:24,810
but I don't kind of have the cognitive development to know that I should stop, but I'm able to move.

396
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:30,150
Like if you have an early walker, I might have said this on the video, apologize.

397
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:36,240
But if given early walker, that can be really challenging for parents because on the one hand, like, that's great.

398
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:42,840
My child's like so active I can do anything, but they don't have any inhibition or inhibitory control skills yet.

399
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:45,600
And so that can be a challenge for families.

400
00:43:45,930 --> 00:43:51,090
Whereas if you have like that second sibling who sat and watched everybody else learn how to walk and took their time,

401
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:58,080
their cognitive development is a little bit more advanced by the time they start to walk, so they might be able to be a little more cautious.

402
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:07,470
It also relates to temperament, which we will talk about, too.

403
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:13,139
So here's just another example of how those interacting domains can play out.

404
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:20,580
And this is in the feeding domain. I know I talked about this a little bit on the video, but this is something that is if you're talking with parents,

405
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:28,800
they want to talk about sleep and feeding and crying like emotion regulation like those are the three big topics are sort of early parenting.

406
00:44:29,610 --> 00:44:35,129
So here, if we're thinking about feeding, you know, feeding is something where there's trends back and forth.

407
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:40,170
I was just at an event on the weekend with people with like little children and they were talking about making their own baby food.

408
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:48,809
And I'm like, Oh, so glad I don't have to decide about thinking about that anymore because that's like ready to make your own baby food.

409
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:50,550
And we all read that baby food article.

410
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:59,940
But anyway, so there's a lot of different like food and feeding choices that just are layered on to parents in that first year.

411
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:09,179
And these maturation pieces have implications for like how well a child can chew, whether when a child can sit up.

412
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:13,290
You don't want to give a child who's like not sitting up yet any kind of solid food.

413
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:18,389
And that kind of aligns with this period in infancy, 4 to 6 months.

414
00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:24,390
But there's variation within there. So kids are going to be just maturing at different speeds in lots of different domains.

415
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:30,970
Okay. And then the other the key things that we're going to talk about, temperament and attachment.

416
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:41,469
These also play into these sort of like like infancy basics, I would say, like basic sort of parenting choices around how well does your child sleep?

417
00:45:41,470 --> 00:45:44,470
How do you put him to sleep? What time do they go to sleep? What are they eating?

418
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:50,560
Are you making your own baby food? Are you mincing? Are they eating table food? Like there's thousands of decisions that parents are making.

419
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:57,399
And one thing that's really important that I say to parents also to keep in mind is like your child's temperament will

420
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:08,140
kind of help you decide some of these things and you will see how that will help guide some of this decision making.

421
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:17,950
Okay. So temperament. So for those of you guys who've taken like developmental psychology,

422
00:46:18,130 --> 00:46:26,980
you've definitely talked about temperament before for those are not we're not as familiar with the way it's kind of thought about in that space.

423
00:46:28,030 --> 00:46:33,850
So temperament is really defined as this sort of like it's like baby personality is how you think about it.

424
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:44,080
And it's this idea that it's early emerging, biologically based characteristics and it's stable across time.

425
00:46:45,790 --> 00:46:50,290
Those are, those are pretty core features of the construct of temperament.

426
00:46:51,130 --> 00:46:55,250
Um, people measure temperament in different ways.

427
00:46:55,570 --> 00:46:59,740
There's thousands of papers on DuPont.

428
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:08,049
Reports of temperament align with like baby behaviors, like we all just watching the videos and like the answers a little bit.

429
00:47:08,050 --> 00:47:14,230
Some to some degree, the more extreme a child's temperament is, the more they tend to align.

430
00:47:14,230 --> 00:47:23,500
So if you have a baby who's, like, super fussy all the time, they, you know, have high negative aspects and high activity levels.

431
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:27,550
So they're like super active and they get angry all the time and they're like, hard to calm down.

432
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:34,390
Those infants are rated as like more difficult by parents and we see it in their behavior.

433
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:41,620
Right. That's like a pretty overt set of behaviors that parents say, oh, yeah, I have a difficult baby cry all the time.

434
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:47,859
But as soon as those parents have like a second baby, they might go, Oh, wait a minute, I thought I had a difficult baby.

435
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:51,250
But actually now I have a baby. That person is like just fine.

436
00:47:51,880 --> 00:48:00,580
So everybody sort of also jokes like nobody really believes in temperament until they have like deeply interacted anyway with like two kids or more.

437
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:08,710
And that's the other kind of dimensions that people talk about, sort of about soothe ability that's really early baby emotion, regulation.

438
00:48:09,490 --> 00:48:15,430
And then this these pieces here are more like on that sort of like anxious, worried spectrum.

439
00:48:15,430 --> 00:48:21,759
So we talk about like babies who are like really nervous or shy and have the other people there maybe are reactive,

440
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:25,270
but it's kind of like from being what I call the tightly wound,

441
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:32,650
like they're just a little anxious and so interaction with other people, to them, other babies can be really like overstimulating.

442
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:39,939
And so there's this sort of sociability to this shyness dimension of temperament, and then there's adaptability.

443
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:40,450
So it's like,

444
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:47,800
can this infant like role with not having slept that many hours or do they like really need their sleep in order to be functional the next day?

445
00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:53,260
And we can all like I think also recognize, right, like these personality characteristics in ourselves.

446
00:48:55,480 --> 00:49:04,000
I will say here's my one of my full disclosures of that's my daughter and that's why I show that picture.

447
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:13,330
And she knows that I show that she's 18 now. She's okay. But she like was put in a goofy Halloween costume along with other infants in her daycare.

448
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:20,800
And she was really distressed by it that she got distressed by many things and their guys were like, okay, whatever.

449
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:24,630
I have like a goofy hat on my head. And she was like, I don't want to, you know.

450
00:49:25,650 --> 00:49:30,420
So that's sort of a good example. I think like he's sort of a little anxious looking.

451
00:49:30,870 --> 00:49:33,870
She's like kind of chill. He's just like, okay, whatever.

452
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:38,910
You guys are being weird. And then she's just like, I am. So you're dating situation.

453
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:45,630
And so then the other important temperament concept that I think is so important,

454
00:49:45,990 --> 00:49:49,920
like for many different things, but certainly for parents, is that idea of goodness, of fit.

455
00:49:50,670 --> 00:49:55,590
Yeah. It's not to say that some parent child dyads are a poor fit,

456
00:49:56,070 --> 00:50:00,719
but it's just that like we all bring different like temperamental features to a situation.

457
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:08,700
And so you can be a parent who is really like, you know, more anxious and you can have a pretty easy baby.

458
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:13,470
Like sometimes those are genetically mediated. And so you could be an anxious parent with an anxious baby,

459
00:50:13,470 --> 00:50:19,800
and that might be a more challenging fit because the baby's crying and you're feeling anxious and you're handling a little,

460
00:50:20,190 --> 00:50:27,210
you know, delicately, what the baby wants is like to be kind of, you know, more like family wrapped or whatever.

461
00:50:28,830 --> 00:50:32,370
But goodness of fit is a good, good way to think about, like,

462
00:50:32,370 --> 00:50:36,810
what is how is my behavior kind of contributing and how is the baby behavior contributing?

463
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:42,899
And like, where do we where are we sort of a mismatch and sort of identifying those areas of mismatch can be really important

464
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:49,800
and helpful for parents not to feel like I've made all these decisions and they're all wrong and I've missed all.

465
00:50:51,130 --> 00:50:58,810
And I'm like, What do I do now? So this idea of like, we all bring something to the table and certain babies are easier than others.

466
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:04,710
I think that's the thing to think about. Government.

467
00:51:05,330 --> 00:51:08,360
We've talked a bit already about attachment.

468
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:12,770
So this is the idea. So temperament is this kind of individual characteristic.

469
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:18,920
Of a baby. Goodness fit. Kind of brings in this idea of like, okay, there's this another interact.

470
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:23,450
And in this space, an attachment is sort of like how it plays out over time.

471
00:51:23,450 --> 00:51:29,900
So it's that relationship. ADFA And this is just a quote from Mary Ainsworth and it's saying, you know,

472
00:51:30,530 --> 00:51:36,829
attachments and affection will tie one person forms to another specific person binding together in space and enduring over time.

473
00:51:36,830 --> 00:51:44,180
So that's important piece of attachment. Like even if we're not like, you know, the two year old or one year old interacting with our parent,

474
00:51:45,110 --> 00:51:48,980
we still kind of have an attachment or relationship about that parent in our heads,

475
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:57,140
like an attachment schema that surprisingly like predicts a lot of like our behavior in relationships and all kinds of things.

476
00:51:59,210 --> 00:52:03,650
The other thing this isn't like the further readings I always almost give.

477
00:52:03,650 --> 00:52:07,100
This is an additional reading, but a preview. You guys can find it.

478
00:52:08,450 --> 00:52:11,809
This idea of I love the title of this paper.

479
00:52:11,810 --> 00:52:15,680
It's called Attachment as a Cultural Need, but Cultural Construct.

480
00:52:16,490 --> 00:52:27,740
And so this title is basically saying We all have need for attachment to a responsive caregiver that is beneficial for everybody's development.

481
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:37,130
The way that attachment has often been defined and someone over here just had asked about this earlier, like moving away from like our tribal raising.

482
00:52:38,390 --> 00:52:47,390
It's this fits that idea. Exactly. So like, we sort of think about attachment and a lot of parenting books talk about attachment parenting,

483
00:52:47,390 --> 00:52:53,630
which that phrase enrages me because I'm like, what even is that you don't know what you're talking about?

484
00:52:53,960 --> 00:53:00,380
Attachment parenting is not wearing your baby with you all the time, which is sometimes how it's interpreted.

485
00:53:01,610 --> 00:53:08,390
It's that we all form an attachment and we can talk about individual differences and what attachment styles look like.

486
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:16,250
But we all sort of without, you know, not in the case of like extreme abuse or neglect, but we all form an attachment.

487
00:53:16,250 --> 00:53:20,899
And so the idea of attachment parenting is like a type of parenting.

488
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:28,760
And some parents don't do attachment parenting. That's what makes me go, okay, so this is attachment.

489
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:33,920
These are sort of these phases of attachment that infants go through.

490
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:37,160
And I like to link it to like kind of parenting life.

491
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:44,630
So this idea of especially if you have like a temperamentally easy baby who's like adaptive and has positive affect,

492
00:53:46,070 --> 00:53:49,940
those babies are the ones that like somebody has a baby and it's not COVID.

493
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:52,610
And you can like have people over your house to be like, look at my baby.

494
00:53:52,610 --> 00:54:00,739
And they can like look at the even happy and can like just sort of be generally in that little baby early baby fog a little bit.

495
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:07,490
They're not like super engaged with any one person, but they're just like, I'm here, I'm cute and baby, like, very easy.

496
00:54:08,090 --> 00:54:12,020
So I would say like two parents, new parents, if you can.

497
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:16,160
If you don't have a really difficult, temporarily difficult infant that is like screaming all the time,

498
00:54:17,210 --> 00:54:20,840
try to like go out to dinner, you know, because that's when it's going to be easy.

499
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:31,219
Just bring your baby in a little care, anything in this early phase as they get more sort of personality and they have more preference and they have

500
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:38,240
the cognition to like distinguish like this is my primary caregiver and this is not my primary caregiver.

501
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:47,600
That's when you get into a little bit more drama like baby drama, because babies will really prefer to be with.

502
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:58,460
Like uppers. Typically, if you notice these changes, what happens for a lot of families in that stage again, pre-COVID?

503
00:55:00,870 --> 00:55:06,850
Yeah. Absolutely.

504
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:10,720
So if you're lucky enough to have maternity leave, we will talk more extensively about that in the.

505
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:24,400
But in that window. Okay. Those babies, many babies in the US start some form of daycare if they can get it in that window.

506
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:32,150
And so if you think about that, that's kind of like a little bit of a collision course between like attachment development and my baby's social,

507
00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:35,650
you know, social, ecological environment and families.

508
00:55:36,010 --> 00:55:43,420
Because babies are like, Oh, now I really prefer you primary caregiver, but like, what are you doing helping me in this space, right?

509
00:55:44,230 --> 00:55:50,760
And so the great thing about this stage is that like babies can engage in a happening, you know,

510
00:55:50,770 --> 00:55:56,670
become formed relationships that are positive and attachment like with other caregivers.

511
00:55:56,680 --> 00:56:03,330
Right. And so early daycare caregivers are actually really critical figures, not only for the babies but for the parents.

512
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:09,340
Like I was reflecting about the baby science thing with my daughter, I was so grateful for those like super knowledgeable,

513
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:18,219
amazing daycare providers who could like talk to those things and gave me a little advice here.

514
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:20,770
This is a big like span of life.

515
00:56:20,770 --> 00:56:28,540
If you're thinking about babies or going from seven month olds who are like playing with some toys and objects, sitting up like in the high chairs,

516
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:37,840
engaging to a 24 month old who can like run around really fast, climb two year old, very, very different infant ages.

517
00:56:38,410 --> 00:56:44,680
And this is sort of a broad space, but I think we can all imagine or maybe have lived through this experience of like, you know,

518
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:50,919
you have some relative they have a child who is like little and cute and maybe you held them when they were an infant and they,

519
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:57,220
like, loved you and it was all great. And then you go and visit them in their like one or two years old and they're like, I don't like you.

520
00:56:58,090 --> 00:57:03,159
You know, something happens and you're like, I thought you loved me. That's kind of what's happening here.

521
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:09,219
It's like you're not if you're especially sort of a stranger to them, you're not their primary caregiver.

522
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:12,820
And so they're like, We don't like to hang out with people who are not our partner.

523
00:57:13,190 --> 00:57:24,839
Those are familiar caregivers. This go coordinated partnership is this idea of that circle of like exploration to safety.

524
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:31,320
So once kids hit this age like thinking, you know, two years old and up, they're sort of ready to explore the world.

525
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:33,270
We'll talk more about toddlers,

526
00:57:33,270 --> 00:57:41,219
but that's the idea of like the infant is ready to explore the world and the caregiver is ready to pull back sometimes and say,

527
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:44,549
like, okay, go explore the world and I'll be here when you get back.

528
00:57:44,550 --> 00:57:48,510
And like at age two, the world might be like the room that you're in, you know?

529
00:57:48,510 --> 00:57:53,000
But it's that idea and this is, you know, goes through life, right?

530
00:57:53,010 --> 00:57:57,510
So like as a student, you're leaving the house and you're coming back or as a,

531
00:57:57,540 --> 00:58:01,860
you know, an adult, you're going further and then maybe coming back and.

532
00:58:04,410 --> 00:58:08,610
The other thing I wanted to point out again, thinking about how those domains interact.

533
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:12,060
So this is very social emotional domain relationships.

534
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:16,740
But this is language development. And The New York Times,

535
00:58:17,790 --> 00:58:27,060
it's it's a cool article because it has little audio clips of sounds that parents make to their babies in like 60 plus cultures.

536
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:34,650
And so you hear that like parent ese kind of talking like, oh, did you do that language?

537
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:44,070
And that really helps form the attachment relationship because that's the form of communication there between in the dyad.

538
00:58:44,580 --> 00:58:49,380
And it's kind of a cross-cultural universal these steps of attachment formation,

539
00:58:50,010 --> 00:58:54,880
even if we're talking about multiple caregivers or kind of universal steps or.

540
00:58:59,190 --> 00:59:02,820
Okay. And then I said we were talking about alo parenting.

541
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:09,060
So this is this term of of having multiple caregivers kind of in your life.

542
00:59:11,190 --> 00:59:14,730
And I think. What are some examples of those?

543
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:22,180
Hello, parents. Have in our lives?

544
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:25,390
Yeah. Their parents. Grandparents, for sure.

545
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:28,180
Yeah. Especially if we're talking about, like, a multigenerational household.

546
00:59:28,180 --> 00:59:35,230
Great grandparents living in the house and living through all those phases of the infant infant's attachment development.

547
00:59:35,650 --> 00:59:40,870
And they're playing a role as an attachment figure for the infant, for sure.

548
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,719
Sure. Yeah. Yeah. And especially if someone's in the house or if they're not in the house.

549
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:53,020
But they're close, you know, they're a frequent visitor. Absolutely.

550
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:57,700
Or multiple houses going back and forth. Yes, sir.

551
00:59:57,730 --> 01:00:00,910
I think of like her for sure.

552
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:12,070
Like constant caregiver. Mm hmm. And I'll just put a put a preview in, which is when we talk about daycare and child care access,

553
01:00:12,790 --> 01:00:20,620
a huge issue because of low pay, stressful conditions, etc., etc., etc., huge amounts of turnover at daycare.

554
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:24,330
But for this reason, that's I mean, that's problematic for many reasons.

555
01:00:24,580 --> 01:00:31,000
This is a big reason why it's problematic because if your daycare provider is constantly turning over your kid,

556
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:35,950
it's like not sure if the parent figure is going to be.

557
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:39,750
Absolutely. The.

558
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:49,620
I had mentioned like, well, I took care of my siblings, but absolutely siblings are important here and play a role.

559
01:00:49,620 --> 01:00:55,470
And yeah, if they have a bigger age gap, it's sort of a different type of relationship if it's really a caregiving.

560
01:00:56,100 --> 01:01:01,500
But what we know also is that in a lot of places where our parenting kind of networks are more,

561
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:08,280
I would say, didn't get disrupted and of sort of like not needed to be reestablished.

562
01:01:08,910 --> 01:01:12,540
You see even younger kids doing some caregiving activities.

563
01:01:15,670 --> 01:01:24,310
When we're across families, family groups, what might be some you know, I think we can think about why those things are helpful.

564
01:01:25,090 --> 01:01:30,040
What might be some challenges of the our parenting kind of or.

565
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:43,710
Which are the same. I would think it have similar values if it's not work to be contributing to the parenting,

566
01:01:44,250 --> 01:01:47,580
but they may do things differently and there may be some inconsistencies.

567
01:01:51,060 --> 01:01:54,870
Partly in thinking that in the club video too, it said, like, you know,

568
01:01:54,870 --> 01:01:59,710
if parents are doing things differently, like it's sort of a it's like a problem to solve for the baby.

569
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:03,059
Right. And they're sort of like, oh, I do this with this person and this with this person.

570
01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:10,860
So it kind of helps build. Like perspective taking of many different perspectives from the from the infant development side.

571
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:18,329
But absolutely, if that's sort of like too inconsistent or too distal and like speaking of grandparents,

572
01:02:18,330 --> 01:02:20,950
that's often a point of kind of contention, right?

573
01:02:21,450 --> 01:02:28,070
Everybody's like, oh, so or mother in laws or certain relationships just are like a little button, right?

574
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:34,790
And so if there's, you know, too much advice given, not enough advice given, like advice given,

575
01:02:35,490 --> 01:02:41,010
especially if the person's not like living in the house and living with the, you know, difficult temperament baby or whatever it is.

576
01:02:42,210 --> 01:02:44,630
How do you navigate all those relationships?

577
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:52,530
And so people talk about like, you know, help will help is help that you like want and need and otherwise it's not help.

578
01:02:53,130 --> 01:03:01,760
Right. So then I think that this kind of idea and I think the other thing to think about is that these relationships can change over time.

579
01:03:01,770 --> 01:03:04,770
I mean, some kids, which I think is wonderful,

580
01:03:04,770 --> 01:03:15,400
can have like alo parenting relationships for their whole lives and sometimes it's like for a period of time and everywhere in between.

581
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:22,860
So it's important to kind of again thinking about interventions and supporting parents and like what is helpful to you.

582
01:03:23,340 --> 01:03:30,720
So talking with parents, like who in your life is helpful, you know, and it might not be the expected people.

583
01:03:30,810 --> 01:03:31,170
Right.

584
01:03:31,650 --> 01:03:41,630
It might be like, oh, you know, my neighbor, I don't know what I would do without my neighbor or my spouse or my mom or whomever it is, my older son.

585
01:03:46,270 --> 01:03:51,050
Um. Okay, perfect. I'm sort of thinking.

586
01:03:51,070 --> 01:03:55,630
Okay. So thinking our parenting attachment, that sort of sequence of forming the bond.

587
01:03:56,530 --> 01:04:00,489
You guys have seen this one before. But I wanted to just say a few words.

588
01:04:00,490 --> 01:04:06,640
And, again, like, this is something that is talked a lot about in that sort of developmental psychology type literature,

589
01:04:07,150 --> 01:04:14,740
but it's important to kind of at least take a tour here just to realize, like, this is how this is really defined.

590
01:04:15,730 --> 01:04:20,049
So the idea of how we assess attachment and really what we're talking about is

591
01:04:20,050 --> 01:04:26,020
like individual differences and attachment style is we have caregivers and kids,

592
01:04:26,770 --> 01:04:33,579
usually kids who are under two. Like anywhere from like nine months to two years is good because they're mobile.

593
01:04:33,580 --> 01:04:39,640
And so part of what you want to look at when parents and children are doing this, it's called the strange situation.

594
01:04:41,140 --> 01:04:45,820
Procedure is like does the kid move toward or away from the caregiver?

595
01:04:45,820 --> 01:04:49,450
And so if they're like four months old, it's it's hard to do.

596
01:04:49,450 --> 01:04:52,420
And that's when you look at something like the still face experiment,

597
01:04:53,410 --> 01:04:58,660
if they're like four years old, they're probably used to their parent kind of coming in and out.

598
01:04:58,660 --> 01:05:08,200
That's pretty established of the behavior. It's not a mild to moderate stressor for all or most kids, but for a nine month old, 2 to 2 year old,

599
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:21,249
that is typically per these for this protocol, it's supposed to be a mild to moderate stressor and that tells a strange situation.

600
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:25,030
But basically, like there's a series of different things that you do.

601
01:05:25,030 --> 01:05:31,140
And one is have a stranger come in who is like a nice kind, usually female stranger.

602
01:05:32,830 --> 01:05:36,069
Then the parent goes out of the room, then the parent comes back in the room.

603
01:05:36,070 --> 01:05:42,399
And basically you look at all these videotapes like you guys did and you code all these behaviors really obsessively, which I'm not going to get into.

604
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:48,490
But the goal is and it's this sort of mild stress so that you can observe this in action.

605
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:54,549
One of the important things I think to point out is that differences in cultural practices and

606
01:05:54,550 --> 01:06:00,580
like we'll see in the baby's movie can really lead to variation in responses to this situation.

607
01:06:01,510 --> 01:06:07,780
And thinking about the example of like, how frequently is a baby left alone entirely by themselves in a room?

608
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:13,120
Like, not all babies have that experience. And so if you put a baby.

609
01:06:14,770 --> 01:06:17,830
SS And they've never been by themselves in a room.

610
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:21,729
It's not going to be a mild to moderate stressor. It's going to be like a massive stressor.

611
01:06:21,730 --> 01:06:26,770
They're going to be like, Oh my gosh, I've never been with no people that are familiar to me before.

612
01:06:28,870 --> 01:06:31,569
And so the other thing and so they actually have found,

613
01:06:31,570 --> 01:06:38,560
like a lot of research in the eighties was really trying to figure out are attachment styles the same across cultures was a big question.

614
01:06:39,310 --> 01:06:42,940
And to my mind, not surprisingly, like they found, oh, they differ.

615
01:06:42,940 --> 01:06:48,160
But it's like we're all sort of assessing kids with the same protocol.

616
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:52,870
And for some kids, it's a it's a more of a stressor. And for other kids, it's less of a stressor.

617
01:06:53,590 --> 01:06:58,659
Also, kids who are in daycare, at first they were like kids were in daycare, have really different styles.

618
01:06:58,660 --> 01:07:06,549
But it's like, well, maybe, but maybe they're also used to being having this separation reunion process with their parent.

619
01:07:06,550 --> 01:07:13,420
And it's not quite as stressful as kids who aren't in daycare to that kid because they're used to it and have coping strategies around it.

620
01:07:14,260 --> 01:07:20,469
Um, the other thing here, the thing about attachment and parenting is that, you know,

621
01:07:20,470 --> 01:07:25,930
depending on sort of your family group and your caregiver relationships, your behaviors can look really different.

622
01:07:25,940 --> 01:07:29,890
So I don't want to bash attachment theory.

623
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:34,870
And I, you know, I think it is very that's very informative and important.

624
01:07:35,380 --> 01:07:38,530
But there are these very big kind of things to. No,

625
01:07:38,530 --> 01:07:42,099
I think that really should provide some context for think about what we know

626
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:46,900
about attachment and for people who are interested in like our parenting stuff.

627
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:54,480
Sara Herdy is like a primatologist who started writing about this and again, kind of in like, I think it's interesting.

628
01:07:55,870 --> 01:08:06,730
We're sort of in like the late seventies and early eighties. And I think she was like a professional person who was sort of going, wait, you know,

629
01:08:07,990 --> 01:08:13,420
an infant is supposed to only be with their child, but like I see it with their parent, with their mother.

630
01:08:14,290 --> 01:08:23,859
But I see all these examples of in the kind of primate world of this alo parenting and lots of whole caregiving and all sorts of other contexts.

631
01:08:23,860 --> 01:08:28,800
And like, why? Why does that seem to seem to be sort of a bad thing here in the U.S.?

632
01:08:28,810 --> 01:08:32,320
So it's a very interesting in terms of when she was doing her work.

633
01:08:32,620 --> 01:08:37,390
And she's also just a cool like a very engaging writer.

634
01:08:39,100 --> 01:08:50,740
Okay. So attachment, our parenting, I would say like this process is really quite important and valid and true.

635
01:08:51,130 --> 01:09:01,270
It's just that who this person is with the hands can kind of see various people in a child's life depending on how they were raised.

636
01:09:02,290 --> 01:09:08,409
Um, okay. And so I'm going to click through just briefly these terms because you may

637
01:09:08,410 --> 01:09:13,680
encounter them and this is what people talk about in terms of attachment style.

638
01:09:13,690 --> 01:09:21,820
So we have these patterns of attachment behaviors that represent a secure dyad or secure attachment relationship.

639
01:09:22,210 --> 01:09:23,980
And that's this idea that we're striving for.

640
01:09:23,980 --> 01:09:30,510
Like the child goes out and explores the world when they're anxious or worry, they come back and they get security.

641
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:38,320
They get like soothing insecurity from the caregiver. They're comforted by the caregiver, and the caregiver can provide that comfort and support.

642
01:09:39,370 --> 01:09:46,390
So that's actually most dyads. What we talk about here is anxious, avoidant dyads.

643
01:09:46,710 --> 01:09:59,440
And this child goes out and the child has a stressful experience and they come back and the caregiver is sort of not able to comfort them.

644
01:10:00,610 --> 01:10:05,680
The child might look a little bit like they don't want to be with the parent.

645
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:09,729
And if you think about what we were talking about at the beginning, like with the phone all the time,

646
01:10:09,730 --> 01:10:13,480
the term I sort of have learned like this parent is not going to be of comfort to me.

647
01:10:13,870 --> 01:10:19,240
And so I'm just kind of kind of remove myself from the situation and not use my caregiver for comfort.

648
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:25,660
Something like this idea of child learns not to show distress and not to engage.

649
01:10:26,530 --> 01:10:31,629
What we also know, though, from a lot of research is that kids who look like this in their behavior,

650
01:10:31,630 --> 01:10:36,370
so they might like actually kind of turn their back to the mom or just sort of like withdraw a little bit.

651
01:10:36,850 --> 01:10:39,910
Their like physiology is actually really going wild.

652
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:45,360
They're not not distressed. People used to think like, oh, they're not distressed, but then, you know,

653
01:10:45,370 --> 01:10:48,219
kind of technology advance and they were able to like put little like heart rate

654
01:10:48,220 --> 01:10:51,879
monitors and things on these babies when they did this protocol and they saw,

655
01:10:51,880 --> 01:11:00,280
wow, these guys are actually super distressed. Maybe their temperament is that like, you know, high shy, overstimulated temperament.

656
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:03,579
They're not able to handle this kind of situation very well.

657
01:11:03,580 --> 01:11:07,510
But what they're showing us in their behavior is like they're just kind of withdrawing and turning away.

658
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:12,730
So it's the reason to think about lots of different layers of development.

659
01:11:12,730 --> 01:11:19,930
Again, this idea of the resistance or ambivalence, dyad is another attachment style type.

660
01:11:20,980 --> 01:11:30,640
So here this idea is that still the child and caregiver dyad isn't functioning well to like soothe distress or soothe the child's distress.

661
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:37,330
But in this case, the caregivers are characterized by in this case, they're sort of like a little more distant caregiver.

662
01:11:37,780 --> 01:11:43,269
This caregiver is more unpredictable. So like sometimes they might be like, Oh, hey, snap out of it.

663
01:11:43,270 --> 01:11:46,990
Sometimes I'm like, oh, I'm so sorry. You know, they just sort of vary in their behavior.

664
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:59,469
And what that leads to is the child's sort of amping up their behavior in a way to get like a response from the caregiver that is consistent,

665
01:11:59,470 --> 01:12:03,960
which is often conflictual. So this is this idea of resistant dyads.

666
01:12:03,970 --> 01:12:09,440
Like, they're always kind of getting into it. They're like, it's a small, you know, conflict in the grocery store.

667
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:12,610
And then the child is like takes it to like goes to 11.

668
01:12:12,610 --> 01:12:18,280
Like they lie down on the floor and have a keeping screaming tantrum over something that didn't seem that big of a deal.

669
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:26,050
So that's this kind of a dyad. And then there's another category.

670
01:12:26,290 --> 01:12:31,149
And so these are different like letters are associated with these.

671
01:12:31,150 --> 01:12:37,210
These are BS, these are ages or CS and these are D's in this like attachment literature.

672
01:12:37,630 --> 01:12:46,420
So disorganized really means the child doesn't have a behavioral pattern took to kind of go to to soothe their distress.

673
01:12:46,420 --> 01:12:55,360
And we see this mostly really in the case of like abuse or neglect that kids don't have kind of a go to way.

674
01:12:56,130 --> 01:13:03,400
Resolving their emotional distress from the. Here like you can think about.

675
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:09,090
This is another reason I hate the term attachment parenting because it's like everybody has an attachment style.

676
01:13:09,100 --> 01:13:12,550
It's not that people are not attached to.

677
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:18,090
They're secure. It's like, Hey, I'm distressed. I come to my caregiver.

678
01:13:18,270 --> 01:13:23,940
We know our pattern. We resolve it. It's all good. These guys are like, Hey, I'm distressed.

679
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:31,020
My caregiver might get angry if I show that I'm distressed. So I'm going to back down my distress and still be like, internally all wrapped up.

680
01:13:32,090 --> 01:13:35,340
That's but that's my coping pattern. And that's like what we do.

681
01:13:35,510 --> 01:13:41,520
You know, it's still a pattern of behavior. This one is this more like loud screaming and kicking behavior.

682
01:13:41,910 --> 01:13:46,890
But again, it's like a it's a it's acceptable behavior for that dyad.

683
01:13:47,550 --> 01:13:53,160
And they experience stress and then this behavior, this disorganized pattern and really.

684
01:13:54,410 --> 01:13:58,280
More maladaptive because the child doesn't have like here.

685
01:13:58,430 --> 01:14:04,280
If you think about an externalizing kid, they might have they might feel better if they like,

686
01:14:04,910 --> 01:14:07,280
you know, get angry and kind of let loose their emotions.

687
01:14:08,030 --> 01:14:17,180
These kids are a little more problematic and they just don't have a kind of go to coping style so that if you see disorganized attachment,

688
01:14:17,750 --> 01:14:22,220
it's really sort of like a not not a pattern. And these are some of these behaviors that we can see.

689
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:25,879
So happy to talk in more detail about that.

690
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:34,010
But so that's just to sort of go through these different types and I'll just show this again,

691
01:14:34,010 --> 01:14:42,630
I showed a similar thing like this the other day, but I've talked about all these like child features and attachment, which is really dyadic.

692
01:14:42,650 --> 01:14:47,330
So that's the difference between temperament, which is more individual and attachment which is more dyadic.

693
01:14:47,870 --> 01:14:52,340
And this is this kind of same idea like before. I think I have like a crying colicky baby.

694
01:14:52,700 --> 01:14:56,930
This can be a baby with a different, difficult temperament. A parent might feel sort of inadequate,

695
01:14:57,350 --> 01:15:02,839
feel like they're not successfully engaging that kid and then withdraws and

696
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:06,860
maybe the kid has more of this avoidant style or seeking negative attention.

697
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:12,020
And it's just this idea of it's all transactional babies giving something,

698
01:15:12,020 --> 01:15:15,950
the parents giving something that's changing what the parent's doing and that's changing what the baby's doing.

699
01:15:15,950 --> 01:15:23,690
Right. And so here is a situation where like a parent locked out, child has an easy temperament.

700
01:15:23,890 --> 01:15:32,510
It's like, well, I am the most awesome parent ever because I just whatever I do, this kid's like, so now they can, you know, respond from distress.

701
01:15:32,990 --> 01:15:36,469
We know how to engage in these play interactions.

702
01:15:36,470 --> 01:15:41,930
We have so much positive, shared effort, and then I seek that out more and interact with my kid.

703
01:15:41,930 --> 01:15:45,650
And then my kid goes out in the world and it's like super confident and engaging with peers.

704
01:15:46,250 --> 01:15:51,050
So it's these early things can really set up these different patterns.

705
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:56,390
And that is one reason why early intervention is so important.

706
01:15:57,230 --> 01:16:02,750
Even if early intervention is like talking with the parent to say, Oh gosh, you know what?

707
01:16:03,290 --> 01:16:07,699
There's this whole goodness of fit concept and like kids are different in their temperament.

708
01:16:07,700 --> 01:16:13,130
And so like you might get an easy kid, you might have a child who's more challenging, who's going to work in different ways with,

709
01:16:13,670 --> 01:16:19,219
but like it can go well, like this is not going well, but it can go well in either case.

710
01:16:19,220 --> 01:16:24,920
And so I think this idea of like framing parental expectations is really critical.

711
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:35,780
Of intervention. And so we will talk more all about this type of thing.

712
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:42,410
And next time I got, like really passionate about emergency,

713
01:16:43,820 --> 01:16:51,500
next time we'll talk about infant health and we'll really kind of zoom in to think about vaccines and thinking back,

714
01:16:51,500 --> 01:17:00,380
sort of like from a public health frame, what what can we do around vaccines and how we talk about vaccines with parents and that kind of stuff?

715
01:17:01,930 --> 01:17:05,470
And I think I can pause there.

716
01:17:07,660 --> 01:17:10,890
You guys, I believe. Yeah. There is one more reason respond for next time to.

717
01:17:11,020 --> 01:17:19,680
So I'm. Because on Thursday we speak that.

718
01:17:29,010 --> 01:17:38,970
Oh and I'll grab the sign and she would help me and then to your name things and I will try to get, get your guys names, all that.

719
01:17:54,620 --> 01:18:32,130
The. But.

720
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:43,640
Blocked the membrane and like just connecting everything using mobile.

721
01:18:44,850 --> 01:18:49,070
Like having, like, the cable interfaces and like on top itself.

722
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:52,940
Yeah. And I'm just. I saw him and I had been able to see him.

723
01:18:53,150 --> 01:18:59,330
Yeah. As I'm me, but. Fine was fine.

724
01:18:59,990 --> 01:19:07,820
I love my design ideas. I would try to feed them the favorite snacks and I'm like, Oh, what was that?

725
01:19:12,350 --> 01:19:19,230
So it's not me. It's just the. Oh, it's deeply personal to the world.

726
01:19:19,860 --> 01:19:22,910
I oh. Okay.

727
01:19:22,990 --> 01:19:26,830
So I've heard of a lot of sales before, but mostly in like relationships.

728
01:19:26,830 --> 01:19:29,649
But I don't know if it's like a theory,

729
01:19:29,650 --> 01:19:41,290
but just some ideas about how like a of sales and your how your parents or caregiver childcare impact how you view relationships when you're adult.

730
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:49,209
So I just thought that was really interesting. I think for like the development topic, how I can tailor an attachment.

731
01:19:49,210 --> 01:19:52,420
Oh, I would love to learn more. Absolutely.

732
01:19:52,750 --> 01:19:55,900
There's a big literature on exactly that. So.
