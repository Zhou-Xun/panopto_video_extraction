00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:03,480
Hello. I'm Theresa Roscoe.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:10,950
I'm going to talk about a climate change issue affecting the Great Lakes and how it impacts indigenous communities in the region.

3
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:15,120
Climate change has had a dramatic effect on water temperatures in the Great Lakes.

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,480
For example, Lake Superior the coldest lakes,

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:26,640
so an increase in the summer surface temperature of four and a half degrees Fahrenheit between 1968 and 2002.

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,350
That's twice the increase in the air.

7
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:39,000
Temperature and surface temperatures are projected to increase by seven degrees by 2050 and 12 degrees Fahrenheit by the year 2100.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,380
These warming lakes have a massive impact on aquatic ecosystems.

9
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:51,360
We'll explore some of those same in just a moment. But it's important to realize that as fish populations and lakes are affected.

10
00:00:51,360 --> 00:01:00,260
So in turn, our Native American communities that rely on the fish as an important food source and part of their cultural heritage.

11
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:03,980
So how do increasing lake temperatures affect fish?

12
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:09,770
First, fish are extremely temperature sensitive, both for their survival and for their reproduction.

13
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:15,410
Species that thrive in colder waters do not do well with the warming lakes.

14
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:21,890
For one thing, as layers or bands of water that are closer to the surface become warmer.

15
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:29,210
Oxygen is less able to permeate through those warm layers down to the cooler bands of water at deeper depths.

16
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:38,660
This lack of oxygen and lower depths forces fish closer to the surface to access more oxygen and out of the temperature zones where they do better.

17
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:43,010
Warmer temperatures can also be more hospitable for the invasive species,

18
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:50,930
such as zebra mussels and quagga mussels that have come to dominate the lakes, which have displaced native fish populations.

19
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:57,590
As a further hit, the impacts of climate change have led to increased extremes in water cycles.

20
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:05,780
We see that high water levels are higher than past averages, and low water levels are lower than past low averages.

21
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,570
This has further impacted native fish populations.

22
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:18,020
For example, whitefish, which spawn in rocky coastal areas, have seen their eggs disrupted by the extreme water level changes.

23
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:23,060
Another significant concern is the increase in harmful algae blooms.

24
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:29,060
Cyanobacteria, also known as blue green algae, flourished in high nutrient waters.

25
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:37,130
We've seen increased nutrient content in the lakes due to excessive runoffs, particularly from agricultural lands.

26
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:42,140
This increase from large storms with high precipitation events that has been caused by

27
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:48,530
climate change has led to more runoff of nutrients washing over the land and into the lakes.

28
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:53,150
The algae blooms, then grow and cause harm in several ways.

29
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:59,330
First, they produce toxins that are harmful to human health and to fish and other aquatic species.

30
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:08,210
Secondly, they prevent sunlight from reaching underwater plants, which leads those plants an important food source for the fish to perish.

31
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:13,370
Third, as the algae die, their decomposition consumes oxygen,

32
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:21,560
which creates hypoxic dead zones where aquatic life cannot survive again, impacting those native fish populations.

33
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:27,080
So we've touched on some of the ways that climate change has affected Great Lakes fish populations.

34
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:35,600
But the human toll of these changes has had a disparate impact on those who rely most heavily on those native fish species.

35
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:42,320
In particular, there are numerous Native American communities living along the Great Lakes shoreline that have seen their diets,

36
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:52,280
their way of life and their cultural heritage disrupted further by climate change only compounding harms done to them by centuries of massacres,

37
00:03:52,280 --> 00:04:01,910
displacement, racism and discrimination. Shifts away from traditional diets to more processed or western foods are one potential

38
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:07,190
factor that has led to skyrocketing rates of diabetes among Native Americans.

39
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:14,690
In the U.S., 16 percent of American Indians have been diagnosed with type two diabetes, while in Canada,

40
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:22,190
40 percent of adults who live on first native First Nations reserves have a diabetes diagnosis.

41
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:30,770
Native Americans are also diagnosed with diabetes at younger ages and suffer higher rates of complications, including kidney failure.

42
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:35,360
We're going to talk about a couple of communities here, though in our Great Lakes region.

43
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:45,650
The Walpole Island First Nations community is located at the mouth of the St. Clair River in Ontario across the water from Alpena, Michigan.

44
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:51,680
There are around 2000 members who are Ojibwe, Potawatomi and other peoples.

45
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:57,920
They live on unceded Island Reserve, the Walthall Island community use.

46
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:07,280
The River is their main source of drinking water, and they also consume fish and fish eating mammals, such as muskrats as dietary mainstays.

47
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:14,390
The community has actively engaged in efforts to fight air and water pollution affecting the waterway.

48
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:20,420
Band members have participated in research on mercury exposure from consuming lake species

49
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:26,180
and are highly attuned to the impact of climate change on their natural resources.

50
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:33,140
Looking a bit further to the North with U.S. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians are descended from a shanab

51
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:39,890
fishing tribes that lived along the shores of the Great Lakes for millennia prior to the arrival of Europeans.

52
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:47,570
The 44000 member tribe is based in Sioux Saint Marie were Lake Superior connects with Lake Huron.

53
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:52,610
Fishing and hunting remain important aspects of life and culture.

54
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:59,230
The tribe has established a fisheries management program that is engaged in research and programs to.

55
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:07,950
To support white fish populations, white fish are the main fish species in shanab culture and in traditional diets.

56
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:12,540
The Tribes program is looking at the impact of water temperature changes,

57
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:19,380
nutrient content and invasive species in hopes of bolstering the struggling fish populations.

58
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:27,780
In summary, we must invest in ongoing efforts to study the effects of climate change on the Great Lakes and the people who live in the region,

59
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:32,790
especially those who bear an unfair burden of negative consequences.

60
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:43,260
It is vital to support indigenous peoples who experience climate related health disparities with resources to mitigate the damage and adapt long term.

61
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:45,785
Thank you.
