1
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:15,600
This party is very similar to the one we told you to have a little bit of both.

2
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:50,030
One of the things you have to show that is what happens in southern Africa.

3
00:00:51,720 --> 00:01:01,860
Do you want to tell me about your chocolate shop?

4
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:10,680
Transform the numbers.

5
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:54,800
It's usually 240.

6
00:01:54,810 --> 00:02:21,540
I wasn't that wasn't doing. You get you got to it with me.

7
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:26,940
You know what?

8
00:02:27,390 --> 00:03:10,810
I have no idea that you can help me find my middle name, which is, you know,

9
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:26,830
I feel like you just wash your hands and that's what kind of you want him become.

10
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:36,010
And I said, okay.

11
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:44,610
All right. So now we have to write on the of I think what you know so on.

12
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:53,549
First of all, sorry for our in seminars department and our next Thursday are also going to

13
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:58,610
be a couple of minutes late giving us some another seminar at the university.

14
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:04,770
So let's start on today's topic, today's lecture.

15
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:13,460
So we're going to move on and talk about this five hour and potentially expand into multivariate random variables and talk about the moments,

16
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,830
X factor values, covariance, correlation and independence.

17
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:26,700
So last time we talk about the definitions for five random animals and it's nothing mysterious.

18
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,830
Essentially, it's just a combination of two univariate roundabouts.

19
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:39,600
And the reason why we want to study that is because in many cases a single random variable is not sufficient to capture everything that we care about.

20
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:47,040
And we may have multiple features that are related and we want to study all together and we

21
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:54,639
have to find what is this drawn city up is what is a joint piano or a PDA is both artistic,

22
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,740
great or continuous. Okay. And we have shown that.

23
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:10,730
How do you. Integration and multivariate integration and partial differentiation to obtain one from another.

24
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:15,500
And so hopefully you have done some exercise after class.

25
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:25,820
So today we're going to move on and extend the definition of moment to these finer things or potentially multivariate.

26
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:33,110
So we start from this expectation. So the activation of a function of this bivariate,

27
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:44,660
you run a variable Y which is denoted by G of X and Y is expressed as follows in particular or simplicity, let's just assume they are.

28
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:56,809
We use the same notation here, right? And if it's discrete from calculus, you know that it actually corresponds to the summation.

29
00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:02,750
And for continuous, it's just that arrangement, agreement integration.

30
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:11,509
Okay. So the expression for the expectation of this function for primary function is a double integration of G,

31
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:23,990
X, Y and with this joint PDA or in other words, you can write it as the joint city of the Y.

32
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:31,040
And the same thing, because we know if you take that differentiation of the CDF, you got the PDA.

33
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:37,900
So that's the same definition as we saw before, except it's for two variables X on water.

34
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:48,110
And so that's the main difference. So the integral here is a bivariate in the big stages or ramus they're just integral.

35
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:55,550
So the two most common case that again I encounter in this class is that these characters have a continuous case,

36
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:59,330
discrete meaning, they are strong and they're just great at continuous meaning.

37
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:03,890
They're drawn to the states, so they are drawn like this grid.

38
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:16,070
Then we're just going to have the summation, a double summation of facts, why IBEX, why this model affects Y that we try and pass, right?

39
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:24,080
So if it's continuous, then you just have this double integration, x, y of x, y, z, drawing PDA.

40
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:34,730
So that's what that's the definition or a generic function, g, x, y, and this jacks y can take specific forms.

41
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:42,639
So that corresponds to a specific moments. In particular, consider this a power function.

42
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:46,100
It acts to the power of our Y, to the power of the house.

43
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:50,329
If you have our in for a one as equal to zero nine,

44
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:57,620
it just means the spiral function is essentially just a univariate function of x and it does not have a y in.

45
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:05,160
That is not hard to say on the left hand side of this term.

46
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:13,080
It's really very healthy. So the left hand side.

47
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:29,950
So the left hand side of of this function, of this equation now becomes expectation of X.

48
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:37,720
Right. If you are a all that's just this adds to the r y to the highest already for a one for a zero.

49
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:42,480
Then this she is just equal to access.

50
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:46,390
So the left hand side is just going to be an expectation of X.

51
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:53,740
Yes. So we're finding the expectation of a univariate variable.

52
00:08:54,280 --> 00:09:00,400
The intuition is that it's like a weighted average, which you like x times of next.

53
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:05,170
What's the intuition here? Very good question. So what is in traditional values?

54
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:13,120
These expectation is still going to be that weighted average. Recall that this is a bivariate function, but it maps to a single value.

55
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:17,590
Right. And maps each two values are single value.

56
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:29,000
So here is still taking the average of all possible pairs of values for asset y and say for those pairs for each pair.

57
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:35,470
Essentially we got about it. So what is the average of that that it maps to the average?

58
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:41,950
Okay. So this jacks y's single value is a univariate value.

59
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:46,510
So here the expectation is still the average of that value.

60
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:54,070
And in particular, in this example, she asks why if are equal to one, has equal to zero, that's just x.

61
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,850
So it just reduces to the original expectation of x.

62
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,450
In fact, if you plug in this definition,

63
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:11,590
you can find it indeed reduces to the original expectation of X for the marginal right roundabout because you have this double integration right.

64
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:17,620
And the target function is only a function of X.

65
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:26,050
There is no Y in it was actually the very first step you can do is to integrate with the respect to Y because it's not a function of what.

66
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:32,170
So the other words is a constant function and y so what would happen if you integrate this?

67
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:44,150
If you calculate this integration by all the words, integrate the drawing PDA with respect to one recall from the last lecture,

68
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:50,040
if you integrate our function, the drawing pdf bears the respect of one parallel.

69
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:54,130
You got the PDF file with the the brown environment, right?

70
00:10:54,630 --> 00:11:02,300
So that would give us just at times the PDA of x, the marginal PDF of X on words.

71
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,920
You also read it right this way.

72
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:14,850
The of city f of x it's a same, but if you take the derivative of the city app, you got the PDF and now if you look at this term,

73
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:31,589
that's the definition for an expectation of X in marginal case and it is the reduces to the case if your chance y function.

74
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:34,620
It's just a function of what one parables.

75
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:46,770
Similarly, if you have about a zero as equal to one and similarly derive that with the expectation of chance y it just the marginal expectation on y.

76
00:11:49,600 --> 00:12:03,710
Questions. Alternatively, you can also have, you know, not are equal to one, but are equal to any constant.

77
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:15,060
Now you can get the expectation of access to the ha ha moment for the random variable x, but the motivation is exactly the same.

78
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:25,470
Your first and figuring it out y you got the marginal CD4 values and then that formula just becomes the expectation or the moment,

79
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:34,739
the RS moment or X and and again here, if you are dealing with discrete, this integrations all becomes summation.

80
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:45,270
If you are dealing with continuous, then this integration is still the integration and you can move the city up by changing it to this joint pdf.

81
00:12:52,440 --> 00:13:07,080
Any questions so far? So now we have to find the biggest vacation for any function of X and Y.

82
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:17,700
Then a very special function of X and Y gave us a very important, very important notation, which is called the covariance.

83
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:26,130
Recall that when we first introduced this five RNA variable, what do we care about is the relation between these two, right?

84
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:31,080
If they are not related, they are independent. There's no point of studying them together.

85
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:38,670
We can just look at it one at a time. So here is a way to quantify how this to run variables are related.

86
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:46,560
Using the notion of covariance. So the covariance between two right of our house and outside of what is defined as

87
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:52,560
follows the covariance of outside of what is thinks about tension of this guy.

88
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:59,090
X minus meaning of x times y minus one.

89
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,820
Forgot about the actual format inside this expectation.

90
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:11,130
This is just a function of.

91
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:24,000
X and Y. Right. So inside this expectation calculation,

92
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:33,719
it's just a function of outside what for any value of outside of y and maps to another back again into one x, one Y into this formula.

93
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:38,160
You've got to about it. Right. And another day it's only a function of X and Y.

94
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:46,500
Now you can use exactly the same formula as we introduced before to calculate what this expectation is.

95
00:14:49,210 --> 00:15:01,140
So if you plug in the formula, that should be the integration, our integration of this function of X set of Y times,

96
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:11,520
the join PDA, the x device x, and that you can solve to get what the covariance is.

97
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:17,940
Alternatively, you can also say that this is equal to.

98
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:57,650
We can also break down this multiple tension between this two terms into this four terms.

99
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:01,610
Right. Recall that the expectation is a linear operator,

100
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:07,970
meaning that can if you have a linear combination inside of expectation, you can always take it outside.

101
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:14,750
So what that tells us is you can further rewrite your original covariance.

102
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:21,440
Is the operation of this for expectations?

103
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:39,170
And now if you look at this four times, this guy is another function of X on the line.

104
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:48,380
Okay, so you just. Keep it there as a patient of x times y minus.

105
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:52,340
So inside the second term me all I see is a constant.

106
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
They only run a variable. The only thing that's random is y.

107
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,600
So you can put this small box outside of this expectation.

108
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:07,610
Again, using the linear narrative of the expand patient operator that gave you new.

109
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:16,170
You have a life. And what is the of life? You mean what?

110
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:21,560
All right, so you can simply. What is it? I mean, why so much life for the next term?

111
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:25,650
You can take it out and figure out that the air backstage doesn't mean.

112
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:29,090
So another new one.

113
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:37,159
And finally, the last time at the concert. So you kind of made up this expectation and you got another meal.

114
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:41,540
Asked me why? So you have your eyes.

115
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:46,970
Why? Scientists knew all about me all of life, eventually.

116
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:54,770
So that is to say the covariance is essentially can be calculated in this way.

117
00:17:54,860 --> 00:18:06,740
They expectation of the product of this to rhinovirus minus the product of the two expectations and that give you the, uh, the formula in the notes.

118
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:18,200
And so the covariance can be expressed as the difference between the expectation of the product minus the product of the patients.

119
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:30,790
And in particular, this quantity, this covariance can be positive.

120
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:34,800
It can also be inactive. There is also be zero.

121
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:41,490
If it's positive, then we basically say the two random variables are positively correlated.

122
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:47,250
And if it's not, we call. The two variables are negatively correlated.

123
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:55,440
And if it's zero, we say they are uncorrelated. I introduce the definition of correlation in a second, but that's how we call it.

124
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:03,810
And if you further take a look at how this covariance is defined, you can get a sense of what positive and negative means.

125
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,730
All right. So if you take a look at this term, this second term,

126
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:18,330
it's only going to be positive if inside this expectation, this guy on average is more likely to be positive.

127
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:24,750
Now, when will this term be positive? There's only two scenarios.

128
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:31,290
Right. Both promises is positive for both processes is not to blame.

129
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:39,330
Those two scenarios is positive. Now, what that means is, if, as is above the mean, it's mean.

130
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:50,579
Why it has to be our average more likely to be above is means that we both can be positive if accessible,

131
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:56,070
always mean that y also has to be below its mean in most times.

132
00:19:56,670 --> 00:20:01,020
That's when they can be both after the positive correlation.

133
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:04,290
Doesn't mean is they change in the same direction.

134
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:09,000
A hierarchy typically corresponds to a higher Y.

135
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:14,400
Higher means higher above their average, and a lower x corresponds to a lower y.

136
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,670
So that's why it's positive and correlated.

137
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:26,340
Alternatively, if the change in different directions arcs goes up, white has to go down, then it should be negatively correlated.

138
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:39,030
But if acts on a y they can freely change. The mobile axis doesn't really necessarily affect them more about y then their uncorrelated become visible.

139
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:49,950
So the Koran plays an important role in understanding the variation in some of overrunning running variables, which we cannot see in a second.

140
00:20:53,280 --> 00:21:01,170
So for covariance, we have Bayes Theorem, which has a very important theorem that acts on a Y hour to run a variables and our two causes.

141
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:06,310
Then the variance can always be expressed in this far.

142
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:16,080
Okay, so a squared times variance of x plus B squared times y plus two ab covariance of outside of y.

143
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:28,500
Yeah. So maybe you can take a one minute, try to write out what the variance is or at plus P and see whether we can show the equation.

144
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:33,840
And also going to work comment on that for.

145
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:23,090
It's. I know.

146
00:23:13,250 --> 00:24:01,230
We? Okay.

147
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:05,120
So have you got it? So here is how you can derive it.

148
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:10,330
So only anything on the left hand side, you're going have a one bar.

149
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:13,810
So it's typically easier to start from the left hand side.

150
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:20,400
Once you write out the expression of the barrens, you can have this bottom right.

151
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:28,810
So the balancing expectation of the random variable minus the expectation of the random variable squared.

152
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:36,660
That's how we define variance. And here as possibly is just another random barrel.

153
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:41,260
It's a function of X is a function of an X and Y, right?

154
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:47,650
So for any random variable, you can always express the virus in this on vessel definition.

155
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:53,200
And once you have that, then it's a matter of how you can get the formulas on the right hand side.

156
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:57,639
If you'll take a look out the right hand side, that you have three different components.

157
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:03,940
One is about this, one is about a one which is about life and the other is about the intersection term.

158
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:11,230
So a natural idea is to combine all of the term corresponding to us in one term.

159
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:16,000
And all the all this quantities corresponding to Y and another term.

160
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:25,480
So that's why we can break down this original so subtraction into this new two terms as recombine the terms.

161
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:30,070
All right. And then you can break down that square to this three terms.

162
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:38,390
Now, if you look at the first one, because excitation is a lean operator, you can got three components, right?

163
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:42,790
Three expectations. And the first one is essentially what it is.

164
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:49,150
But it's not one. What it is that's that's apparent.

165
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:52,210
Right. Amounts are what they are.

166
00:25:53,620 --> 00:26:01,000
And we also know from previous letters, Birds of Ajax is just a square variance of itself.

167
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:06,090
And that's a first term that we need. Similarly, the last time in the variance API.

168
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:10,810
So it's a square circle. And now the only thing that's left is the middle term.

169
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:17,919
For the matter of time, again, we use this of inner seniority, of transportation once more to take out a,

170
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:22,540
take out the B, and what's left is a definition of covariance.

171
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,110
So that gave us the relation in the in the notes.

172
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:43,570
Any questions they pose for, any pair of random variable and any pair of constants.

173
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:58,850
And you always have this in relation. And from that relation, we can also use it to define a new notion of correlation.

174
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:07,940
The correlation between two roundabouts, if defined as the covariance divided by the square root of the product of the two variances,

175
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:12,140
in other words, divided by the product of two standard deviations.

176
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:18,649
And you can also write a covariance.

177
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:25,820
If we denote the correlation to be zero, then you can move this denominator to the left hand side.

178
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:35,630
You have this relation, which over the other was a covariance between two random marbles is equal to the correlation times.

179
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,750
The product of two standard deviations.

180
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:55,860
So that's the relation between correlation and covariance and correlation is subtracted is more desired than covariance,

181
00:27:55,860 --> 00:28:02,130
mainly because correlation is a is that is is a bounded and also is easier to understand.

182
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:12,780
Origin is imbalanced and are linear transformation in the sense that if you have A plus B and C,

183
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:18,660
Y plus D, then the correlation is going to be the same as X and Y.

184
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:27,600
You're going to say that in the second in the in the next slide, and it's almost invariant and a linear transformation.

185
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,630
And I'm going to say why it's called almost invariant.

186
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:40,679
And also another very important property of correlation is it's always bothered between that they wanted one since they found it.

187
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:46,830
It's easier to interpret, easier to understand. We know what the upper bound is, what we know, what the lower bound is.

188
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:55,530
So we know in the absolute scale, whether it's a high correlation or a low correlation or covariance, you cannot do that right.

189
00:28:55,740 --> 00:29:02,550
If I tell you the covariance between why is the is 10th, is that large or is small?

190
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:09,149
We don't know. Right. But if I tell you the correlation between X and Y is nine nine, you know,

191
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:15,450
that's that's large because the largest body with an incarnation of B is 1.9.

192
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:18,570
Nine is conceptually a very strong correlation.

193
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:24,900
So that's why correlation is the impact is more desired than covariance.

194
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:48,700
And. These two results, these two properties, we actually need to prove that, not take them for granted.

195
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,920
And so to show the first is invariant to linear transformation.

196
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:59,230
What we can do is we can start from two around variables X and Y.

197
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:02,799
For simplicity, we just assume they have zero variance.

198
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:13,090
One point if they have now zero mean and now universe, you can always transform them to how mean zero is one.

199
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:20,130
So that's trivial. So for simplicity, we're just assuming they have zero variance one and a correlation row.

200
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:29,820
Now consider our two linear transformations of this to run a variables you is a linear transformation of x we as a transformation of y.

201
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:35,020
Okay, now with this linear transformations, we can easily gain the following.

202
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:40,120
First, the variance of this new run of our value is b squared.

203
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:45,130
We just got this. It goes away.

204
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:52,720
We calculate the balance, right? The constant doesn't affect errors and or variance of B is D squared.

205
00:30:53,590 --> 00:31:01,960
Now we can also calculate the covariance of you want to be using the definition, defining the definition of covariance.

206
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:07,630
You can check covariance or you on a v is B times the time of the row.

207
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:13,570
So I would check this afterwards.

208
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:18,370
Just use that definition should be so difficult.

209
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:24,310
And once you have that three components now you can calculate the correlation between you want to be.

210
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:28,989
If we kind of show that the correlation between you want to be in the same and the

211
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:34,030
correlation between according to what that means is inherent to our transformation,

212
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:42,460
right? So let's see that correlation of you want to be is the covers of you and we're divided by the standard deviation.

213
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:49,740
So covariance is b the row and starting the deviation there's a square root of B squared the square.

214
00:31:50,590 --> 00:32:00,030
If you do this, if you cancel out PND what's left is a sign of P The sign of the time zero.

215
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:13,960
Okay, so you say here you have this two sign function sine function only take three values positive one negative one zero.

216
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:23,200
If B is positive, then sign I'll be as one. If B is negative, sign up B is negative one at p zero sign of B is zero.

217
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:25,150
So in this case.

218
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:38,780
If both B and C are positive or both are it, then I call correlation between you and B is exactly the same as the correlation between an x and Y.

219
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:50,120
The only the only scenario where it is not equal is either B and the one of them is zero or they have different signs.

220
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:56,240
Which actually makes sense. Right. I'll get off all this and see.

221
00:32:56,250 --> 00:33:00,630
These are just the constants. They are just the ship of the random.

222
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:09,420
Just focus on this. Be a theme. If I originally I saw a lion positively correlated and he was happy to be an actor, wanted to be one.

223
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:12,960
Now, of course, not an accent. A white going to be naturally.

224
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:18,600
If I originally called it, it correlated the native accent of was going to be negatively correlated.

225
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:25,410
That's why it has a sign switch. But the actual value of the car isn't going to stay the same.

226
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:34,990
So that's why we call it almost empowered to linear transformation.

227
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:39,100
And that almost part is talking about this sign of difference.

228
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:45,380
And another scenario if you have B, r, d equals zero, then it's a trivial case.

229
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:49,970
If B R is zero, then either u, r v is going to be a constant.

230
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:56,540
There is no virus, then there is no covariance because they've got zero virus.

231
00:33:56,810 --> 00:34:00,110
You have a zero in the denominator that's just not defined.

232
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:11,380
Right. So you cannot define correlation for a constants between a constant and a random variable.

233
00:34:11,890 --> 00:34:20,470
When we talk about covariance or correlation, we always talk about two two run of animals with non-zero variance.

234
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:24,690
Otherwise, it's not logical questions.

235
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:34,050
All right. So second part and we want to show that the role is bounded between zero and one.

236
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:43,740
And to show that again for simplicity with that accent of why to be mean zero balance part why and a correlation being quite a row so

237
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:59,430
we can use this trait like calculating the expectation of X plus or minus y square because we know that from the previous formula,

238
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:09,900
if we have RS plus Y, we're going to have covariance, they're going to have covariance from the various calculations of X plus one.

239
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:15,450
So that's why we want to calculate this, the expectation of X plus or minus Y squared.

240
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:30,540
And I want to break down this, this square operation and off with fabrication of x squared expectation y squared plus or minus expectation of 2xy and.

241
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:38,810
Says Why and I suppose have museums also expectation of a square and why y square?

242
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:43,130
They are just corresponding to the variance of x and Y. So that's post one.

243
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:48,590
And lastly, this expectation of X Y is two times zero.

244
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:58,530
So what we have is this two plus or minus two times zero says the left hand side is always greater than zero zero.

245
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:05,110
So the right hand side is also greater only for a zero. Now just give us the row has to be bounded between that table one.

246
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:17,960
And so that's. I can prove that this correlation is found in both 91 and one.

247
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:32,120
So again, the idea behind this probe is you really want to introduce this role in your formula.

248
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:41,570
And the simplest way to introduce it role is by calculating this expectation or the variance of this X plus B you are.

249
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:53,720
And in this particular case, since we normalized the X and Y already, we can just calculate the expectation of X plus Y Square and X minus Y Square.

250
00:36:54,140 --> 00:37:02,210
Both is going to give us a role in the calculation. And with this inequality, we can end up with one step.

251
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:15,940
A sense. Right.

252
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:24,320
So that's one is the example of this hybrid distribution.

253
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:33,200
In most cases, binary distribution is not very straightforward, is not.

254
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:39,140
So we have talked about different families of distributions for universal amount of animals.

255
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:45,350
Right. But extension to even 5 hours run of our lives is not straightforward.

256
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:52,310
We do not have families for five arid random animals because it's just going to be very tedious.

257
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:59,150
The parameters that we are going to need to define is bivariate distributions going to be

258
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:06,620
definitely more than just the original parameter plus a single covariance or single correlation?

259
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:16,130
It's going to be much more complicated. That's why is not is not established except for this normal distribution.

260
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:21,530
For normal distribution. Bivariate actually has a very clear import.

261
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:27,530
So to run a variables are said to be standard bivariate.

262
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:38,569
Normal distribution was correlation row. If the density function is as follows and if it takes this formula one over two

263
00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:47,450
py I'm Steiner start a square root of one -0 square times this exponential term.

264
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:57,800
So the inside of the exponential the numerator is x squared minus two row x y plus y square denominator is two times one minus row square.

265
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:07,100
And in fact, for a multivariate random variable, you can also have a close form expression for the normal distribution,

266
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:10,340
multivariate normal distribution in a very similar format.

267
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:20,480
So normal is a special case where you can define a bivariate distribution and a multivariate distribution in particular.

268
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:24,740
If we set a row to be zero here, row is a correlation.

269
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:36,290
So that is just that. That is something that you can you can take it as a fact for now.

270
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:48,170
Although from this definition, from this joint PDF function, you can now directly tell that a row this parameter road is the correlation.

271
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:52,160
In order to show that zero is a correlation, you need to do the derivation.

272
00:39:52,910 --> 00:40:01,580
You need to follow the definition to actually show that this row is that correlation analysis to take advantage of the fact.

273
00:40:01,970 --> 00:40:07,460
Okay. If we set a row to be zero, what are we can find?

274
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:13,100
Then you do not have this term right. And this term, this goes away.

275
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:16,690
This becomes two times x, y.

276
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:23,480
So you can also rewrite it as a square Y minus y.

277
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:32,270
Square. What if a row is zero?

278
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:43,800
Then this term goes away. This kind of B and square laws y square.

279
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:55,900
So if your side role to be zero when it comes finally you can rewrite the original joint play out into this two function apart out of two functions.

280
00:40:56,470 --> 00:41:05,650
Each one only involved one parameter. Moreover, is not all involving one parameter.

281
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:13,030
It's also not the standard normal idea for one parameter, for one, run a variable.

282
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:17,540
So the first part is just the flags.

283
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:21,310
And the second part is that those are centered on the distribution.

284
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:27,100
And we're going to introduce the definition of independence for random variables.

285
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:31,570
And this is definitely one of the definitions for independence.

286
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:41,590
If the drawn pdf can be written as the product of two marginal PDFs, then the two run of our are called independence.

287
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:50,440
So this is the classic example where Role Zero actually leads to this independence between the two roles,

288
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:56,260
but that only holds for the normal distribution for general distribution.

289
00:41:57,370 --> 00:42:05,330
Zero correlation does not necessarily mean independence, but later we will show that independence.

290
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:09,520
I implied zero correlation, but not the other way around.

291
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:13,480
Zero correlation does not imply independence.

292
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:22,960
The only exception in the normal distribution for normal zero correlation is the same as independence.

293
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:28,510
Okay. So here is the the reason why that's the case.

294
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:45,000
So the farmer, Renamo is a very important example.

295
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:51,120
So we need to take a closer look and really and our state and what's going on here.

296
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:57,880
For the generic by a very novel idea.

297
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:02,520
This is the formula followed by very novel PDR.

298
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:10,230
I recall from the last lecture we have said that you can be got a marginal PDR from the joint PDR.

299
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:11,250
You can always do that.

300
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:22,920
And the way to do it to to the way to get marginal PDR from drawn area is what how do you got a marginal area from joining PDR?

301
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:34,389
We have this 215 hour normal PD out every morning and the marginal distribution for us and for Y.

302
00:43:34,390 --> 00:43:40,420
How do we do it? Other variables.

303
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:46,780
You integrate out the other random variable. Right. It just take that integration with respect to access.

304
00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:51,219
We got the margin off a y or integrated version with a risk factor.

305
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:59,530
Why take out the marginal for x when take the integration with respect to you?

306
00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:05,410
Just treat a y as a constant. Right. You only care about the hours in this function when doing the integration.

307
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:08,980
Similarly, if you do it for y, you only care about a y.

308
00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:23,830
So that's how you can get marginals. So to cut the marginals, we can take the if you look at this formula, the first part is just a constant.

309
00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:28,000
All right. So that's not a problem.

310
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:35,050
Your integration, the only thing that's going to be complicated is the use of exponential term in particular.

311
00:44:35,450 --> 00:44:44,770
That's made of hard this two row times and times y because that both involve x and y.

312
00:44:45,310 --> 00:44:51,190
If you want to integrate out X, you have to take care of that. So here is how you can take care of it.

313
00:44:51,610 --> 00:44:57,850
Okay, so let's say you want to integrate out y or not.

314
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:11,890
And so you want to got the marginal or let's say our target is to get this guy.

315
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:18,930
And by doing this equation to infinity.

316
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:27,100
Y y y.

317
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:31,690
Okay. So we want to solve this. We want to integrate.

318
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:42,670
Integrate now. Y. So we need to do something with this term in order to be able to integrate what we need to tease out the Y part to make an integral.

319
00:45:43,930 --> 00:45:50,230
And if we do not have to worry about an X, because as in this calculation, it doesn't constant you can just leave it.

320
00:45:51,820 --> 00:46:05,410
So you are to to gather why we noticed that this function is what is the part that we need to worry about is an exponential term to the power of y.

321
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:09,040
Quadratic. All right.

322
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:13,240
So the r that we need to worry about is e to the negative.

323
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:20,710
Some quadratic function of one. I should remind you of the PDA of now.

324
00:46:22,210 --> 00:46:30,670
It can take advantage of the fact that a pdf of a normal integrated one to help you solve that integration problem.

325
00:46:30,970 --> 00:46:35,510
So that's the idea. So that's what we need to take care of this.

326
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:43,320
Why square if we can? Upon all terms that involve life in them, in a square format,

327
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:51,390
then we can do a change of variables and take advantage of the PD out of the normal distribution to solve that integration.

328
00:46:52,270 --> 00:47:00,660
Okay. So more specifically, what are we going to do is we can, first of all, right, square here and then complete a square a Y.

329
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:06,890
Once we complete the square, we have this Y and minus row X squared.

330
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:16,020
So that is the quadratic function that involves Y minus some constant that we don't have to worry about.

331
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:27,240
And once we have that, you can put this environment terms together and only focus on this, this, this K part that involved.

332
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:38,100
What if you reorganize your terms, you will find that even end up with a function that does not involve Y and another function that I do involve y.

333
00:47:39,730 --> 00:47:45,960
And what you want to do is to integrate that function, integrate this function with respect to Y.

334
00:47:47,010 --> 00:47:50,770
So if you do the integration, this part is going to be the constant.

335
00:47:50,790 --> 00:47:55,590
Now, you can easily take outside of this integration. All we have to do is to integrate this.

336
00:47:58,470 --> 00:48:03,840
And now, as you have already complete a square, you can change the random available.

337
00:48:04,470 --> 00:48:13,800
Originally, you have to do it for y. If you said let's say Z, you define new round of our whole z to be.

338
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:29,120
My miners. Grow up, Ray they do this change verbal then this term just because exactly what they square.

339
00:48:30,970 --> 00:48:36,010
All right. And our deal wise as the deal Z day becomes an integration.

340
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:45,070
From negative infinity to infinity, some function where the key parties E to an inactive Z squared over some calcium easy.

341
00:48:46,650 --> 00:48:52,720
And from there, you can take advantage of that pdf or novel to solve that integration.

342
00:48:53,710 --> 00:49:01,900
I'll give you 2 minutes to solve it, to try to integrate this function with respect to Y using this change overall and say,

343
00:49:01,900 --> 00:50:34,360
well, I've got the final result and. Not used.

344
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:54,940
Can you see? It's.

345
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:12,670
And so I hope you all get it. So once you do that immigration change of arrivals few and upwards.

346
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:22,030
About our. It's just this number and and you summarize by now that this is the PDF for start a novel distribution.

347
00:51:22,690 --> 00:51:27,310
Similarly you can do it for Y. You got the same you got the standard normal distribution.

348
00:51:27,910 --> 00:51:33,130
That is to say, if you start from a binomial normal distribution, marginalize it.

349
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:37,420
You can find each marginal distribution is a normal distribution.

350
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:41,560
That's actually a very strong and a very interesting result.

351
00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:47,710
And so far in normal, if you marginalize it marginally, it's also not.

352
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:56,680
But the reverse is not true. If you start from two models to marginal normal distribution, combine them.

353
00:51:57,790 --> 00:52:03,459
They are not necessarily a primary novel. They could be five are enough, but they could also now be five.

354
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:47,220
Our results. All right. So let's take a break and come back to this with you.

355
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:57,520
So you ran out of power there at the end of introducing me to the more dominant region?

356
00:52:57,550 --> 00:53:04,890
That's totally fine. You don't have to do a bit because this is an easy, very easy change.

357
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:13,980
Just so you know, this is essentially an album with not me, and they're about their practices.

358
00:53:14,350 --> 00:53:33,720
And then you don't have to know about it and probably notice that you are in the same I know I need line here instead of having your here.

359
00:53:35,770 --> 00:53:41,500
So the key is reading, right? So you need a square provide for three or 4 hours.

360
00:53:42,930 --> 00:53:57,520
Now the terms at this point, that's a different website.

361
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:01,390
Now heart dropping.

362
00:54:01,390 --> 00:54:06,730
The author, Constance Wu comes by.

363
00:54:06,730 --> 00:54:12,910
Notice is not the term when you can drop the term.

364
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:18,610
This is only true the pdf. It's not opinion opinion.

365
00:54:18,730 --> 00:54:26,170
Then you have to right after this information, whatever, whatever.

366
00:54:26,170 --> 00:54:34,360
Knock it out so you can see it.

367
00:54:35,170 --> 00:54:46,319
Now it's a side function is just that out in the last year or two years, it's all about making sure that what you see is not compatible.

368
00:54:46,320 --> 00:55:13,220
This is not going to for to investigate that resistance.

369
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:28,060
You know, let me show you something that can be a common mistake of a hotel,

370
00:55:28,510 --> 00:56:02,240
which is close contact of what is going to function that, you know, you're not going to.

371
00:56:04,410 --> 00:56:13,950
You have to be inclined to make it clear.

372
00:56:19,080 --> 00:57:02,310
You know, just a couple of weeks ago, you were telling me you could find a solution.

373
00:57:03,930 --> 00:57:10,320
This is the Home Office.

374
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:55,420
You know what I feel like I'm just going to go as far as I know that you should be in touch with each individual,

375
00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:06,120
which is not always extremism and terrorism.

376
00:58:09,870 --> 00:58:30,689
I know that you think got the national anthem conducted by the U.S. Congress, which is actually pretty awful.

377
00:58:30,690 --> 00:59:25,640
But I think it's just interested in know what happens in Jerusalem and how long do you think you're thinking about it?

378
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:47,670
Well, we don't know exactly what's going on.

379
00:59:51,830 --> 01:00:03,810
If she going to visit the Army.

380
01:00:04,590 --> 01:00:18,630
So I think that people have enabled, by the way, if you want to volunteer at a hometown tour, this is a last chance.

381
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:25,470
I don't want to sound sad spirit, but really hoping to see more of you volunteer.

382
01:00:26,490 --> 01:00:37,770
And I can be a little more aggressive asking, you know, call your names, but I really hope that I can help with that for the future letters.

383
01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:43,030
So just email me, okay, if you want to do it. All right. So moving forward.

384
01:00:43,050 --> 01:00:50,430
Independence. Independence is a is another definition that is different from zero correlation.

385
01:00:50,430 --> 01:00:56,370
So that is something that needs to be we need to be very careful about.

386
01:00:56,670 --> 01:01:03,480
So independents although from a layman perspective this.

387
01:01:04,090 --> 01:01:09,190
Similar to the notion of zero correlation, but in fact they are quite different.

388
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:14,080
Any it's much stronger than zero correlation.

389
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:20,260
In fact, independence implies zero correlation, but not the other way around the correlation.

390
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:28,300
As you will learn more in the future, he was saying on the correlation is more about a linear relation become to run of animals.

391
01:01:28,780 --> 01:01:33,970
If they are linear related, they are correlated. They are not linear related.

392
01:01:34,420 --> 01:01:39,190
Even they are related. Even though they are dependent, they can have a zero correlation.

393
01:01:39,730 --> 01:01:46,060
So correlation is more about the linear relation between two variants. So independence is more is stronger.

394
01:01:46,750 --> 01:01:56,680
But tell about whether the distribution or whether this two random arrows is ever related by family.

395
01:01:56,680 --> 01:02:07,240
The definition is as follows If two variables satisfy the following equation for any RL, that's A and B, then they are set to be independent.

396
01:02:07,780 --> 01:02:10,850
And that equation is the probability of accident.

397
01:02:10,870 --> 01:02:18,820
A, Y, and B is equal to actually A and the probability of passing A and the probability of A wide B.

398
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:26,420
And so these actually originate from the definition of independent for events.

399
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:40,250
If you think about the axiom, A to B is set in the original central space at the time, be to be another set in our original sample space.

400
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:49,850
These basically tells you that any those two some two sets of events are independent.

401
01:02:50,870 --> 01:02:57,950
One side is derived from the run of Marvel and the other side is derived from running out of a line.

402
01:02:58,940 --> 01:03:08,150
If any pair of those sets are independent, any parallel those events are independent, then there's two or variables are set to be independent.

403
01:03:10,910 --> 01:03:14,450
So that is consistent with our definition or the two events.

404
01:03:15,310 --> 01:03:26,780
Okay. And under this common ground, axioms of probability, it can also be shown that the previous definition is equivalent to the following.

405
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:28,010
That is the city.

406
01:03:28,010 --> 01:03:39,830
Our function that John set up express price the product of marginal city pretty call that the city tells us everything about the distribution,

407
01:03:40,490 --> 01:03:47,990
including the probability of acts in a particular set or a probability of Y in another particular set.

408
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:53,960
So any of them can be can be derived from this drawn city and marginal city.

409
01:03:55,250 --> 01:04:03,900
If the city are satisfied based on relation, drawn, set out and going to the further marginal city are then using the color of occidental

410
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:11,150
probability can show that these equation also holds for any set rb these alcohols.

411
01:04:11,420 --> 01:04:16,160
So the x and y are also independent. This is if and only if.

412
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:20,900
And so it's equivalent to condition five on a y to be independent.

413
01:04:23,190 --> 01:04:26,370
And since it's built upon the senior function.

414
01:04:26,370 --> 01:04:37,079
So it's it's universal. It applies to both discrete and continuous and mixture data types and in particular, if you just want to focus on that,

415
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:42,510
this great running a variable or you just want to focus on the continuous run available you can folder.

416
01:04:42,510 --> 01:04:47,130
I got the following equivalent definition for independence.

417
01:04:47,970 --> 01:05:00,000
That is, that joint pump is equal to the Carnot marginal pumps or the joint PDR is equal to that part of marginal payoffs.

418
01:05:06,450 --> 01:05:16,910
So these two guys. You can you can show one from the other by doing integration or by doing differentiation.

419
01:05:16,940 --> 01:05:23,000
Partial, partial derivatives. Then you can do integration.

420
01:05:23,510 --> 01:05:27,290
Our integration of X and Y on both side and you got the the top part,

421
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:34,490
you can see the relation and you can do partial liberation with respect to X and Y took out the bottom part.

422
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:45,680
Okay. So that is in practice that's more often used to show that a to run of our balls are independent

423
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:52,430
compared to the original definition because it's almost impossible to have a pair of parallel sides.

424
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:59,840
You always have this relation, but it's much easier to check whether the marginal p m p the marginal CDO.

425
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:05,120
If you multiply the two y that is equal to the joint CDP or not.

426
01:06:05,630 --> 01:06:09,860
Okay. So that's how you can show to run of our balls are independent.

427
01:06:19,030 --> 01:06:24,160
And one additional note that I want to make is that notice that here.

428
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:33,460
The right hand side boy concerns marginals and the left hand side, is that right?

429
01:06:34,090 --> 01:06:40,930
So that is to say, if X and Y are independent, in fact, you can gather that joint from the marginals.

430
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:47,050
And in fact, that's the only case where you can got drawn from the marginals.

431
01:06:49,170 --> 01:06:51,580
You need to know that the two runabout balls are independent.

432
01:06:52,510 --> 01:06:59,440
Then you can directly gather drawing distribution from the marginals and that sort of trivial ones.

433
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:04,150
You know, they are independent. There is no point to that. You want, you know everything about it.

434
01:07:04,630 --> 01:07:08,080
You can get everything you want from just a little count of marginals.

435
01:07:09,310 --> 01:07:12,520
So that's sort of a trivial case. But I got the point.

436
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:16,720
So you only got the drawing from the marginals if they are independent.

437
01:07:23,060 --> 01:07:24,470
Any question about the definition.

438
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:41,100
So another point I want to make that in practice, there are two ways that you can be clear to run about roles, to be independent.

439
01:07:41,490 --> 01:07:46,020
One is definitely following the definition of, you know, their joint distribution.

440
01:07:46,710 --> 01:07:56,070
You can marginalize it to gain the marginal distribution. Verify whether that joint distribution is equal to the product of the marginal distribution.

441
01:07:56,580 --> 01:08:00,840
That's the most mathematically rigorous way to define to run a variable.

442
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:03,930
So our independent name might fall in this definition.

443
01:08:04,470 --> 01:08:13,020
Alternatively, in some cases, from the description of the problem, you can infer the two random variables are independent.

444
01:08:14,010 --> 01:08:22,920
But that is more subtle, right? So unless you have very strong evidence that based on how the two random variables are defined,

445
01:08:23,460 --> 01:08:29,700
there are truly independent, otherwise declarative involved in that approach.

446
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:39,030
For example, I can define X to be the weather off today, either insurance or not and define why it would be.

447
01:08:40,050 --> 01:08:46,200
I don't know that the age of a particular individual apparently is those.

448
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:49,350
Those two things are totally irrelevant. Right.

449
01:08:49,830 --> 01:08:53,580
So you can safely argue that X and Y are independent.

450
01:08:54,360 --> 01:09:00,510
But if you say, Alex, the you know, the the weather today, Y is the temperature today.

451
01:09:01,590 --> 01:09:05,580
That doesn't sound independent depending on how you define it.

452
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:10,350
It may or may not be independent. So be very careful about the second approach,

453
01:09:10,740 --> 01:09:19,500
namely that the nominal approach of defining independence as sometimes they could be very useful, for example, in the next example.

454
01:09:21,870 --> 01:09:33,450
This is a very classic example. The fourth alternate also example, this is originally designed to to give a rough estimate of this high value.

455
01:09:33,990 --> 01:09:45,030
And the setup is as follows A table is a road where the lines distance one unit apart amid all the land out,

456
01:09:45,270 --> 01:09:48,870
which is the last part equal to one is growing randomly on the table.

457
01:09:49,950 --> 01:09:54,630
Then the question is what is the probability that the meal intersects a line?

458
01:09:57,810 --> 01:10:03,960
That's the set up. Assume that you have a table with straight lines.

459
01:10:06,950 --> 01:10:12,560
And the distance. All these lines are all equal to one unit.

460
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:20,300
And then you randomly throw a needle on this table.

461
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:32,450
So this is a needle with a lens out. So the question is, why is the probability that needle in a sex alliance, it may have another needle.

462
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:37,190
That's how that intersect with the heart.

463
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:41,660
Sometimes you may have needles that are, you know, start with a line.

464
01:10:41,670 --> 01:10:51,410
Sometimes it's not. If you throw many, many times, you can count how many times the needle actually intersected with the line.

465
01:10:51,590 --> 01:10:57,560
And you've got a you've got an estimate of this probability.

466
01:10:58,820 --> 01:11:02,120
Now, the question is, what is that radical expression?

467
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:06,260
What is the radical derivation of that probability?

468
01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:11,390
And is a question clear? All right.

469
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:16,370
So to solve this problem, we can define to run a variables to start with.

470
01:11:16,670 --> 01:11:20,480
And one is.

471
01:11:22,850 --> 01:11:33,980
I want it better. Okay. So as is defined to be the distance from the lower end of the needle for the nearest two line above line.

472
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:38,570
So, for example, this needle, this is your eyes.

473
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:42,860
This is a lower back to the nearest line above.

474
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:48,830
And for this needle, this is you are right.

475
01:11:49,070 --> 01:11:57,500
So that's the first random variable we define. And another run of our what we define is the fader, the angle from the vertical to the needle.

476
01:11:58,380 --> 01:12:02,990
So this is straight up, this one.

477
01:12:03,590 --> 01:12:09,410
And this is better for the other needle.

478
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:17,210
Okay. So first question, what is a ranch or what is a support for this to right arm?

479
01:12:18,140 --> 01:12:38,270
Well, that's what is a support. What is the support for the first round of our Bill X?

480
01:12:41,690 --> 01:12:45,020
That's 2021. Very good.

481
01:12:45,260 --> 01:12:50,430
And why is that? Because as is defined as a distance.

482
01:12:50,450 --> 01:12:54,620
Right. So, of course, it's definitely going to be lower about by zero.

483
01:12:55,310 --> 01:12:59,330
And it's a distance from the low end of the needle. To the nearest.

484
01:12:59,330 --> 01:13:02,750
The line of up says, we know the lines are one unit apart.

485
01:13:03,050 --> 01:13:06,590
So and most is one. And that happens.

486
01:13:06,590 --> 01:13:15,230
If the needle has a lower end just on this slot or right above this line, then you have a the maximum barrier one.

487
01:13:15,700 --> 01:13:20,210
And so that's the support for X.

488
01:13:20,430 --> 01:13:23,570
Any can take any value from a 0 to 1. Right.

489
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:28,070
What about beta? Yes.

490
01:13:28,490 --> 01:13:32,720
0 to 90 degrees. Say that again. 0 to 90 degrees.

491
01:13:32,870 --> 01:13:36,920
There are not a great 90 degree. Any different answer?

492
01:13:39,020 --> 01:13:45,470
0.89. So recall that this needle can either tell to the right or tale to the left.

493
01:13:45,710 --> 01:13:53,130
Right. So there are two different angles of 90 to 90.

494
01:13:53,330 --> 01:13:58,280
Yes. So it's going to be negative pi over two or 90 degree.

495
01:13:58,700 --> 01:14:02,630
Right. Depending on which unit you use to.

496
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:12,500
I over to say that that's going to be an advantage for theta if a light lie flat.

497
01:14:13,220 --> 01:14:17,260
Then it's either pi over two are pi over two.

498
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:20,920
If it's telling it this way, it's going to be an active angle.

499
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:24,800
This way, it's going to be a positive. All right.

500
01:14:25,290 --> 01:14:32,570
Alternatively, depending on how we define it, you can also divide from 0 to 180 degree or zero to PI.

501
01:14:33,170 --> 01:14:39,410
It's going to be the same. So here we're just going to define it to be negative pi over two or two, pi over two.

502
01:14:39,620 --> 01:14:43,760
Again, theta can take any value from this range.

503
01:14:44,750 --> 01:14:50,970
Okay. So that that's the support for this to run about.

504
01:14:51,780 --> 01:15:04,170
Last question. In this to run Marvel's Independent or not, are they still running Marvel's Independent?

505
01:15:05,430 --> 01:15:12,180
Yes. No, because the angle will influence the distance from the line.

506
01:15:13,590 --> 01:15:24,790
Okay. So I need different thoughts. Yes.

507
01:15:25,750 --> 01:15:32,600
Yes. Because no matter where your navel vertical axis, your angle will still be the same.

508
01:15:32,630 --> 01:15:37,280
It's just like we're on the verge of war. So I can have any of those.

509
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:46,370
Just like for the good. So if you fix the angle, you can move the needle up and down arbitrarily.

510
01:15:46,650 --> 01:15:51,950
Right. Alternatively, you can fix the needle and move the angle arbitrarily.

511
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:59,180
Right. So that's why conceptually, these two are unavoidable.

512
01:15:59,750 --> 01:16:03,200
They should be in better. All right.

513
01:16:03,980 --> 01:16:07,340
So this is the example that I mentioned before.

514
01:16:08,150 --> 01:16:12,890
You may be able to conceptually argue why to run a viable independent.

515
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:22,690
So this is one example. So by. Carefully think about how that needle is can lie on this table.

516
01:16:24,070 --> 01:16:33,130
You can or you would be able to tell that they actually are independent runabouts.

517
01:16:33,490 --> 01:16:38,590
Normally one does not necessarily have to have the honor, but that makes sense.

518
01:16:40,220 --> 01:16:50,090
So again, you can fix u, r, l and a movie on theta arbitrarily or you kind of fix your.

519
01:16:51,860 --> 01:16:57,410
And more of your theta arbitrage. So one thing does not necessarily affect the other.

520
01:16:59,690 --> 01:17:10,280
When I say need that fact, the owner for the subsequent analysis because without the independence we do not know the drawing distribution.

521
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:17,690
But with independence, we can grab the joint distribution by multiplying the individual distributions.

522
01:17:18,710 --> 01:17:22,760
So in this example, we actually have to go from the second round.

523
01:17:23,390 --> 01:17:27,590
We need to argue that independence before we can got started solving this question.

524
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:36,680
Right. Does that make sense? The question. Any question about the independence of this two roundabouts?

525
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:41,460
Okay. All right. So that's the question.

526
01:17:41,730 --> 01:17:47,220
What is the distribution for accent? The cardinal. Now we know they are independent.

527
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:50,670
Right. And we know their range for each run of arable.

528
01:17:50,970 --> 01:17:55,730
What about that? Distribution or access?

529
01:17:56,700 --> 01:18:04,560
So the distance. What is the distribution? If you randomly throw the needle on the table.

530
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:09,180
What would be the distribution or the distance?

531
01:18:12,180 --> 01:18:17,740
Do you favor one particular distance over another or they are equally likely to happen?

532
01:18:21,430 --> 01:18:28,000
It's a random throw, so you kind of lie anywhere, right? If you forget about the angle, just fix the angle.

533
01:18:28,570 --> 01:18:34,930
Consider all possible scenario that can throw the needle. It should apply uniformly from 0 to 1.

534
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:41,770
Right? So again, that's a conceptual argument based on that argument.

535
01:18:43,150 --> 01:18:46,150
We can say this X is a uniform.

536
01:18:52,030 --> 01:18:55,210
Is a uniform distribution. And what about theta?

537
01:18:56,800 --> 01:19:01,570
If face of this distance become like an imposition.

538
01:19:02,770 --> 01:19:08,770
It should also be a uniform. Okay, so that again, it's a conceptual argument.

539
01:19:09,340 --> 01:19:18,940
And with those argument, with those preparation, now we actually know everything about this to run about everything about their distribution.

540
01:19:20,650 --> 01:19:23,860
We know there are marginal distributions. We also know they are independent.

541
01:19:24,250 --> 01:19:28,570
So now you can actually write out their joint distribution, right?

542
01:19:29,110 --> 01:19:34,269
And once you write out this joint distribution, think about how to answer this question.

543
01:19:34,270 --> 01:19:37,790
What is the probability that the needle in a sense, a lot.

544
01:19:37,810 --> 01:19:44,130
What does that translate to in terms of this to run a barrel? What is the probability that you are trying to calculate?

545
01:19:45,270 --> 01:19:50,170
And I'll give you maybe 5 minutes.

546
01:19:50,590 --> 01:20:00,070
You can discuss with your neighbor how to express this problem in terms of Axion theta and how to calculate.

547
01:20:08,660 --> 01:20:17,210
He was 2 minutes.

548
01:20:27,230 --> 01:21:00,890
That's. Interconnection between.

549
01:21:04,470 --> 01:21:20,100
My daughter who's been.

550
01:21:29,470 --> 01:21:45,170
So with this news to be.

551
01:22:04,300 --> 01:22:09,180
Was. Okay.

552
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:18,810
So let's look at this together. As we argued by a random window, the two round of our goals are independent and both follow this uniform distribution.

553
01:22:19,140 --> 01:22:22,770
A one from 011 from negative pi over two into power two.

554
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:27,250
That just means the joint distribution. You can directly write it out.

555
01:22:27,390 --> 01:22:32,450
The drawing distribution drawn PDA for this two continuous around a barrel.

556
01:22:32,850 --> 01:22:33,810
It's just a model.

557
01:22:34,170 --> 01:22:44,310
The product of this two marginal PDL perhaps is the marginal P now as a constant one or this data is marginal P the obvious one over pi.

558
01:22:44,820 --> 01:22:54,060
If you multiply the two, it got this one over pi again, the constant function from this rectangle area.

559
01:22:55,260 --> 01:23:02,120
So it's only now zero taken by one of our pi four has greater than one greater than or equal to zero.

560
01:23:02,130 --> 01:23:12,330
That's why I got have one theta from pi over to our power two power to now the key is to notice that the middle intersect.

561
01:23:12,330 --> 01:23:16,410
A lot actually translates to this equation.

562
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:21,510
Hey x plus at all times cosine theta.

563
01:23:22,170 --> 01:23:25,260
So. Here.

564
01:24:13,610 --> 01:24:17,600
Okay. So here is our need. All right?

565
01:24:18,380 --> 01:24:27,590
What do we know is that this distance is right, and the needle has a lens l which is a constant, and the angle beta.

566
01:24:27,650 --> 01:24:33,260
In other words, this angle is also theta. In order for the needle intersecting with the light.

567
01:24:33,290 --> 01:24:42,910
All we need, if we know that lower on the lower end is a below this line because that's how we define X in order for that needle to,

568
01:24:42,920 --> 01:24:46,460
you know, something we've always needed, the upper end is above the line.

569
01:24:48,620 --> 01:24:55,400
In other words, this distance has to be greater or equal to this distance.

570
01:24:56,210 --> 01:24:59,800
If that's the case, then we know that needle mass intersected with the line.

571
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:03,800
That's a necessary and sufficient condition or equivalent condition.

572
01:25:04,910 --> 01:25:08,960
Now, the only problem is how do we represent this business?

573
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:21,979
So from algebra, I should know that this this is a right this is a perpendicular relation, right?

574
01:25:21,980 --> 01:25:26,840
So this is how then this this that's going to be at all times cosine theta.

575
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:33,590
This is our cosine theta and this is our x.

576
01:25:33,950 --> 01:25:40,540
As long as arcs is the last or equal to our times, cosine theta, we know they intersect, otherwise they do happen.

577
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:47,870
So that's how we can translate the original problem in terms of this, to run a variable that we have fun.

578
01:25:49,010 --> 01:25:56,270
Now the problem becomes we want to calculate the probability of loss are equal to how?

579
01:25:58,790 --> 01:26:03,740
I'm just cosine theta. All right, so that's one way we want to calculate.

580
01:26:04,250 --> 01:26:11,660
And what do we know from the previous derivation is that these this accent theta.

581
01:26:32,550 --> 01:26:39,930
What we know from the previous derivation is that this accent theta jointly the swallow uniform distribution on this,

582
01:26:39,930 --> 01:26:52,920
a rectangle on this rectangle area and on this rectangle area and always have drawn PDL one over pockets and these actually have a area of pi.

583
01:26:53,190 --> 01:26:57,390
So. If you do, the integration is the integrated ones.

584
01:26:57,660 --> 01:27:02,010
So that's where they are on the support or as unfair.

585
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:10,970
Now if you draw these region acts that are equal to at all times cosine theta and we'll.

586
01:27:12,340 --> 01:27:15,480
Recall that cosine zero is one. Right.

587
01:27:15,900 --> 01:27:20,640
So then it won't touch the y axis at all.

588
01:27:21,300 --> 01:27:27,000
And cosine pi over two and cosine multiply or two are both zero.

589
01:27:27,540 --> 01:27:40,890
So this is. This is the area where we need to calculate this probability.

590
01:27:44,310 --> 01:27:48,960
So you just draw this region on this plot.

591
01:27:49,500 --> 01:27:56,430
So that is the region. Since we know the proverb, the joint distribution is a uniform distribution.

592
01:27:56,820 --> 01:28:01,830
Then the probability of this region and just the area of this region.

593
01:28:02,940 --> 01:28:07,680
Now the problem becomes what is the area of this region? I.

594
01:28:08,790 --> 01:28:19,500
And you can do it either from your algebra, taking advantage of the algebra knowledge, or you can more rigorously do it using that integration.

595
01:28:20,100 --> 01:28:25,590
So what do you want to do is to take the integration integration on this region.

596
01:28:29,140 --> 01:28:34,270
More of this constant function, he adds these data.

597
01:28:38,510 --> 01:28:48,210
So that's what we need to do. And you can break down this double integration with the response to Axion Theta separately.

598
01:28:48,750 --> 01:29:09,680
In particular, we can first. Peter.

599
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:29,989
So to solve this double integration, we can proceed to one by 1/1, integrate our tax and then into our theta in particular.

600
01:29:29,990 --> 01:29:42,260
If we want to integrate Alexa by any given theta, you can notice that for any given theta we are going to be from 0 to 1 to this point, right?

601
01:29:42,500 --> 01:29:47,300
And that one is just the cosine at all times, cosine theta.

602
01:29:48,020 --> 01:29:55,010
So you're going to have the integration from zero to our cosine theta over pi.

603
01:29:55,790 --> 01:30:01,579
Yes. Okay. And then you're innovating with respect to theta.

604
01:30:01,580 --> 01:30:05,600
So that's going to be a problem. Not active to I over to the pi.

605
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:10,960
Over to be theta. Right.

606
01:30:12,280 --> 01:30:17,750
And that gave us. To do this integration.

607
01:30:18,500 --> 01:30:24,150
The. Now there are plenty.

608
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:37,560
And we thought, oh, I a.

609
01:30:40,580 --> 01:30:45,020
Your body read pi over two. Over two.

610
01:30:45,130 --> 01:30:50,670
All right, so that's two. To our overclock.

611
01:30:52,030 --> 01:30:59,550
So that's the area. For this shoot in an area, and that is also the final result.

612
01:31:02,890 --> 01:31:11,320
And this has for our last reporter one of the needle shorter than one needle is greater than one.

613
01:31:11,320 --> 01:31:18,370
Then you need to be a little bit careful because now then this point is going to move up here, right?

614
01:31:19,060 --> 01:31:25,930
You're going to have something like this. And when you're doing the integration, you have to be extra careful because you have the upper body here.

615
01:31:27,430 --> 01:31:37,810
So if you want to challenge yourself, you can consider what is the probability going to be if you are l is created by our last now one.

616
01:31:38,260 --> 01:31:51,760
This is our final result. Okay. And the question is in particular, which is one in particular, which is for what is the way?

617
01:31:52,360 --> 01:32:02,800
Why are we choosing always coordinates? So why do we choose the return horizon, this older audience with our end goal.

618
01:32:03,100 --> 01:32:09,610
It's not. Yeah, so it's not necessarily a coordinate.

619
01:32:10,330 --> 01:32:16,420
It is a quiet corner of the coordinate. So the reason is really for convenience, right?

620
01:32:16,420 --> 01:32:22,960
So by dividing the two variables this way we can first of all get the two

621
01:32:23,180 --> 01:32:27,670
variables that you shouldn't bother to write mammals and also their independent.

622
01:32:28,090 --> 01:32:34,330
Yeah. Do you think what you want in terms of this to run a variable is pretty easy, mainly from convenience.

623
01:32:34,690 --> 01:32:38,470
There must be other ways to dramatize this problem.

624
01:32:38,710 --> 01:32:43,600
That's a very good question there. Something called whether we can find other ways to dramatize this.

625
01:32:44,170 --> 01:32:51,760
Instead of using defining our sounds made this way, you should be able to do it in alternative ways.

626
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:56,530
But this is by far the simplest know setup of this problem.

627
01:32:58,160 --> 01:33:03,770
Other questions. All right.

628
01:33:03,770 --> 01:33:09,860
So now we say that the probability of the line of the needle in a second with the line is too out over time.

629
01:33:10,640 --> 01:33:14,840
That's assuming you know that the variable about the variable now.

630
01:33:14,930 --> 01:33:26,360
Right. As I mentioned before previously when performed the fun design this experiment, they do not know what the value of a part is.

631
01:33:27,470 --> 01:33:36,100
And in fact you can use this value. And by doing an experiment, by throwing this needle numerous times at a count,

632
01:33:36,110 --> 01:33:41,690
how many needles actually intersect with the line to get an estimate of this quantity?

633
01:33:42,770 --> 01:33:48,230
Then from that estimate and this formula, you kind of humorously solve for the PI value.

634
01:33:49,220 --> 01:33:52,440
Yes. So in the graph. Okay. Right.

635
01:33:53,120 --> 01:33:58,010
Um, that seems to imply that whatever pi.

636
01:33:59,980 --> 01:34:13,340
Al has to be last. But what I want to know so very says this is one of the range of actions ones that this isn't just a PDF body one of.

637
01:34:16,470 --> 01:34:22,090
That makes sense. So this box based on a one.

638
01:34:23,610 --> 01:34:30,210
So that's the X. And that is the purpose of this, huh?

639
01:34:30,810 --> 01:34:36,420
Yeah. This curve is our acts equal to our total data.

640
01:34:37,320 --> 01:34:46,380
So you can start with. With his wife. And when your data is zero zero, I think this is important.

641
01:34:46,780 --> 01:34:52,020
Right. That's why this height is the difference.

642
01:34:53,130 --> 01:34:58,290
Okay. So we're so happy close to one divided by five.

643
01:34:58,380 --> 01:35:04,260
That's the PDA function. That's a PDF on this screen. It's a joint PDA.

644
01:35:04,740 --> 01:35:08,970
Joint PDA. Well, there's two of our boys and one of our clients and constant this.

645
01:35:13,210 --> 01:35:21,070
I'm serious about it. It's not about computers. So this is the support for this to run a viable.

646
01:35:21,350 --> 01:35:25,860
All right. And I'm gonna support the PTA. John Kerry is just a constant.

647
01:35:25,870 --> 01:35:30,580
One of a kind. All right.

648
01:35:30,610 --> 01:35:34,330
Any other questions? Okay.

649
01:35:35,530 --> 01:35:39,280
Very interesting experiment. Right. Okay. So that's an example.

650
01:35:42,850 --> 01:35:50,620
Assuming that if we do another experiment, we randomly select two points on a line of,

651
01:35:50,630 --> 01:35:55,900
let's say, so as to be on the opposite side of the midpoint of the line.

652
01:35:56,210 --> 01:36:04,420
And the question is, find the probability that the distance between them is less than eight over three.

653
01:36:08,450 --> 01:36:19,860
But. You have a line of the letter A and here is the midpoint.

654
01:36:20,700 --> 01:36:23,790
So pick one point here to pick another point here.

655
01:36:25,620 --> 01:36:33,000
So the question is, what is the probability that this distance from this point to this point is less than.

656
01:36:37,490 --> 01:36:38,950
Your $0.03.

657
01:36:41,850 --> 01:36:51,980
So from the set about this question, you can say that we need to run the at point from 0 to 8, from 0 to 8 or to an eight or two or to eight.

658
01:36:54,070 --> 01:37:01,540
So that inspires us to set our set up now to run of our balls as follows acts as a coordinate

659
01:37:01,560 --> 01:37:10,930
11.02 over two Y is another coin the in the second point randomly selected or 2 to 8.

660
01:37:11,530 --> 01:37:18,190
Okay, so that's it. Now this has zero over two and this is us eight.

661
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:31,120
So the way that we define it. And this is our apps.

662
01:37:32,200 --> 01:37:36,340
This is our work.

663
01:37:36,910 --> 01:37:47,080
Okay. Since we care about the distance between those two points, which can be expressed as a Y minus X if we started to run a variable this way.

664
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:53,300
So again, when we need to notice that there are a couple of things.

665
01:37:53,480 --> 01:37:58,190
One is that X and Y, are they independent or are not independent?

666
01:38:06,650 --> 01:38:14,210
Yes. These are independent. They are independent because each one is chosen on its own side.

667
01:38:14,360 --> 01:38:21,450
Independent of the other one. Yes, exactly. So because they are chosen independently from satellite.

668
01:38:21,470 --> 01:38:24,080
They are independent. And in fact, this would be independent.

669
01:38:25,460 --> 01:38:34,400
So, again, we need to rely on that fact beyond the derived of drawing from the joint media for this to write about rebels.

670
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:41,960
So they are independent. And also we can know the marginal distribution for IOCs and what is in there are randomly chosen.

671
01:38:42,230 --> 01:38:51,430
So they should also be uniform. But barrels of the range is different, perhaps is from 0 to 8 or to a wise from eight over 2 to 8.

672
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:56,570
That way we can find the joint distribution for this to amount of barrels.

673
01:38:56,940 --> 01:39:05,840
And so they are defined on this square area from zero to a or to air or to or to a.

674
01:39:06,470 --> 01:39:13,640
And on this area, the Joint PD is just the product of the two Mars Arcadia, which is two over a square.

675
01:39:14,870 --> 01:39:18,020
So that defined the distribution for this final round of arable.

676
01:39:18,930 --> 01:39:23,210
Now we can use that to solve our question, to solve our problem.

677
01:39:23,780 --> 01:39:29,350
We want to know what is the probability that a Y minus X is a last one or three?

678
01:39:31,100 --> 01:39:36,950
I'll give you a couple of minutes to try to solve this using what we have just shown.

679
01:39:48,230 --> 01:43:02,910
It's. Got it.

680
01:43:05,940 --> 01:43:57,719
You've got to show me your hands. All right.

681
01:43:57,720 --> 01:43:59,190
So let's look at this together.

682
01:44:00,390 --> 01:44:09,720
I find it helpful to just draw out the support of this binary random variable and really express what this region of interest is.

683
01:44:10,120 --> 01:44:18,840
Right. So in this case, we know ARGs is has support on zero to A to B or to fly to support a day or 2 to 2.

684
01:44:19,140 --> 01:44:23,100
So it's a really busy square area. Okay.

685
01:44:23,410 --> 01:44:28,470
And on this square area, we know that the PDA, the joint PDA is a constant.

686
01:44:28,710 --> 01:44:41,040
I suppose our uniform run of our well, so the constant is four over a square and the next we need to express the probability in this figure.

687
01:44:41,760 --> 01:44:45,900
So y minus the last that or three that just corresponds to a baseline.

688
01:44:46,560 --> 01:44:51,930
Right. And below this line is Y minus X last two or three.

689
01:44:53,970 --> 01:45:06,810
And that's from algebra. And essentially what we want to say is that what is the probability of the points falling into this triangle area?

690
01:45:09,780 --> 01:45:22,410
Namely the original problem of Y minus X plus or three now becomes the problem of calculating the area of this right of the triangle area.

691
01:45:24,630 --> 01:45:33,900
And that is because we have a uniform distribution and it is not uniform that you have to do the integration of the joint PDA on this triangle area.

692
01:45:34,650 --> 01:45:42,660
But that is uniform. Then what you need to do is to multiply that a concept four over a square with this area.

693
01:45:43,650 --> 01:45:46,110
Okay. So that's what we need to do.

694
01:45:46,650 --> 01:45:56,220
And that you can either by noticing the coordinates or there's two points, you can calculate this to adjust and calculate the variance,

695
01:45:56,490 --> 01:46:02,580
calculate the area or is and do more formally throughout by using the integration.

696
01:46:02,820 --> 01:46:07,620
Okay. But there you have to be careful about the element of the integration.

697
01:46:07,860 --> 01:46:10,470
If you want to integrate the called X first.

698
01:46:10,830 --> 01:46:21,060
No, I think even Y should start right by any given Y from this region and it should start from this point to this point,

699
01:46:21,420 --> 01:46:31,860
and then your area should start from this point to this point to just be a little more careful about the integration limit for this integration.

700
01:46:32,340 --> 01:46:35,340
Okay. And the final result, I want to go into the detail.

701
01:46:35,340 --> 01:46:46,920
I hope you can finish that. The calculation, the final result is to have or not any questions.

702
01:46:49,910 --> 01:47:00,890
All right. Important result of all the independents, which I have already alluded to, is that if X and Y are independent, then the converse is zero.

703
01:47:01,550 --> 01:47:05,960
And the proof actually is that it's quite straightforward.

704
01:47:06,110 --> 01:47:11,540
So if independent. We know the joint idea is equal to the product of the PTO.

705
01:47:12,140 --> 01:47:18,080
So we can evaluate this expectation of x y using the formula.

706
01:47:18,260 --> 01:47:27,110
Right, since they are. So the joint pain can be rewritten as the product with the individual PDM these two or just becomes separable.

707
01:47:28,490 --> 01:47:34,580
And once you can separate the two, you can know that the expectation of X times Y it's just the equal to.

708
01:47:37,060 --> 01:47:40,810
The protocol acts on a wall. And by definition, the covariance is zero.

709
01:47:41,680 --> 01:47:45,490
Zero. Correlation zero. Okay.

710
01:47:45,640 --> 01:47:49,600
So that's why independence implied zero correlation.

711
01:47:50,410 --> 01:47:54,760
But the other way around is natural and is only natural.

712
01:47:56,020 --> 01:48:01,330
And one important exception is the bivariate normal distribution.

713
01:48:01,840 --> 01:48:10,900
So if Obama in normal independence do equivalent is equivalent to zero correlation without exception.

714
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:16,780
But here is a clear example of why the reverse is not true.

715
01:48:17,290 --> 01:48:22,369
Because they are the two run of our lives. And why sat that at square plus y square?

716
01:48:22,370 --> 01:48:36,610
I got a one and and I assign a y only it take three might not go one zero on a six and if so on distribution, follow this discrete distribution.

717
01:48:37,990 --> 01:48:42,250
Then you can you can calculate the correlation is zero.

718
01:48:43,630 --> 01:48:49,510
Just follow the definition of a made as to calculate what the expectation of X times y is.

719
01:48:49,720 --> 01:48:55,180
What is the answer is what is the expectation y is and then plug everything together.

720
01:48:55,850 --> 01:48:59,640
Then you have the covariance so you can find.

721
01:48:59,650 --> 01:49:05,500
In this example, co correlation is zero. However, these two are not independent.

722
01:49:06,400 --> 01:49:19,600
Good you can find they are not independent either by conceptual argument or using the definition because that's all it says they are.

723
01:49:19,660 --> 01:49:26,680
The sum of square is equal to one meaning. If you know the value of one, you almost surely know the value of the other one.

724
01:49:27,910 --> 01:49:33,580
Not exactly, but pretty much sure and in know the value of the other one.

725
01:49:34,360 --> 01:49:43,900
So actually they are not independent. And more rigorously you can calculate the drawn out and the marginal clamp and verify that

726
01:49:43,960 --> 01:49:49,450
the drawing piano is not able to turn off the marginal people so they are not independent.

727
01:49:50,010 --> 01:49:58,270
Okay, so here is the derivation of the marginal piano or ax.

728
01:49:58,510 --> 01:49:58,840
Here is the.
