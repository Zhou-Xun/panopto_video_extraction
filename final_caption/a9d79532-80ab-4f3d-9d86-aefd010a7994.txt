1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:04,709
Here is where I first thought was symmetric.

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:06,780
And when I was like, No, I think it's less skewed.

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:18,320
And then I saw that I had the rear wheels and then, you know, I look back at the and come back through as I feel supreme, do like not focus.

4
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:22,530
He's like, I've been debating about like introducing I at this point. Nothing.

5
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:30,600
A lot of pride. A lot like the speaker. Yeah. I think it's like I'm so I feel so much for.

6
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:36,870
When were you going to do? Like like I was trying to get drunk so much,

7
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:48,540
you know let's go for it was to the other question because I you have to you want to work there for you because here's what I don't know.

8
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:52,810
Maybe that the friends listen it's really, really helpful.

9
00:00:53,270 --> 00:01:03,390
They think about that because we might say, oh, I think this is like the only thing I need is like everybody has to work on it.

10
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:21,330
Yeah, I was like, we have like nothing. We're just like, oh, I think that, oh, your colors might make sense to us, but I don't know.

11
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:30,480
Like, now it's like has number three for now.

12
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:36,209
But you know, I'm like they're like, and if you haven't got anything to say,

13
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:49,080
something that might be more than just everyone's like, yeah, well you until four.

14
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:54,809
You're like, I made fun of her. Yeah, she's our hardest thing.

15
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:57,850
And I was like, okay, yeah.

16
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:18,959
I mean, they're like, all things just because when I was listening to it, when I was growing out of my time crushing my friends, it was chaotic.

17
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,740
But it's all good because I need to do a project.

18
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:33,950
I feel like I need to get it done. I'm so happy to know that, you know, I broke out of the background.

19
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,010
That's fine with me.

20
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:42,930
I just everybody I know, everyone has a lot going on, but I don't want to like I think I'm intentional about not being like, well,

21
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:56,010
like I know you answer questions all the time, but it's not really honestly,

22
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:05,790
I'm pregnant and maybe like, but it's like openness is God gave us the last two years of existence.

23
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:13,720
So I've taken both of those things and I feel like it works.

24
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:27,180
So there is a connection between so much time and really what I meant to be more just like.

25
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:35,220
So obviously you have to do something that you want to work on.

26
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:40,079
I know what you wanted to do, like starting. I like this in the background.

27
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:46,830
I mean, I didn't I know it was like strong what I was doing at the you and then narrowed

28
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:54,330
down to individuals and businesses with a number that says we don't want to do.

29
00:03:54,510 --> 00:04:04,440
I know exactly as I looked at it, Trevor and she just wanted to find that intersection with all of those like details.

30
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:11,549
And so I kind of like took my eyes and tried to make my paragraph sequential, like slowly narrowing it down type thing.

31
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:21,060
And like some of them are citations of members of the council and see,

32
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:33,550
like if you think about for everything is just like, you know what, how did you not figure out what you just you know,

33
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:39,480
it's just like any kind of like I was trying to get my facts of something before the yeah,

34
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:45,479
I like didn't realize this was going to start until the end and like I was 18.

35
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:58,680
Everyone in this like 25 year old one, like I was like, hopefully run it and then I like one back that summarizes so much about it.

36
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:02,880
I did it. I was like. It was a very different kind of environment.

37
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:09,730
But yeah, that's kind of like the concerns I had. I guess like guys like myself probably like, no, thank you.

38
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:17,470
I don't like things like I just think we raise and just want to get one to the background.

39
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:36,110
The second person, one person says to me like, You're innocent.

40
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:41,889
Like, I don't know. But it's not like one is saying.

41
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:50,709
It's not like one idea. That sounds good.

42
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:55,270
Yeah, I wasn't sure of that part either, because I know like, it's like you're Bertrand Russell Utilities.

43
00:05:55,270 --> 00:06:00,700
I was like, maybe I should, like, just send this link to kill you, like, but yeah, that makes sense.

44
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:05,090
I guess. Yeah. I don't know what you're going to subsidize.

45
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:09,100
So that's that. Yeah. That's why I was like, I wanted to.

46
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:19,330
I feel like knowledge, lifetime prevalence rate three are always at some point, you know, I don't know.

47
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:26,430
But then I was like, Oh, I'll explain that because it'll come to me about a trend.

48
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:30,140
It's like, Yeah, so I got this problem.

49
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:33,370
I was like, Is it bad if I just don't include the candidate here?

50
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:44,880
I don't know. Okay. I think, like, there can be like this or I think last year, which I think it really horrible.

51
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:50,229
So what is the problem? I didn't see that. Yeah, I think it's time for testing very quickly like.

52
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:54,170
Oh, I hear about what you're saying. It's not a continuation of the term.

53
00:06:54,550 --> 00:07:00,610
Sorry, I just thought you would also comment. I was like, they're the ones in red.

54
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:05,620
I didn't like it. Just like, there's not that much proactive.

55
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:12,960
Sure to address this data pretty often then I don't know what that is.

56
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:22,330
I think the Marriage Association American College of Obstetricians and she went to college.

57
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:34,610
Yeah. Using a like there are so many things that I made that I really like.

58
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:50,380
I just feel like I want to ask something else kind of like, so you would stop there.

59
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:57,690
So you said that was like I was like, that's not real.

60
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:03,760
I didn't know. And that's what I, I've never heard of. And the other thing is like, what's the break this time?

61
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:07,200
And then which other cluelessness I actually mean just talking about?

62
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:18,620
Okay, no, no rush. So I might be able to help talk about it cause consequences for me.

63
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:23,610
I might just be better or uninsured.

64
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:30,910
It seems like it's important information. It's like it's actually relevant to this person that for vaccine actually I

65
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:41,020
don't know for your comments that you city is also like place I know so the city

66
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:48,790
I as far as like I want to do like a full read through and then it's not I guess

67
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:57,280
like tax complications clubs consequences and we have exactly that right.

68
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:08,490
And consequently with this being the short term physical thing about much time

69
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:17,640
and I started to get into the situation because the back cover is like 0.30.

70
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:28,690
Okay. Well, I feel like I doesn't have any, as you point out, you know,

71
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:41,410
during something like that, these are children's disorders nervosa or to do that for you.

72
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:58,360
And I can imagine if I was like I figured out not really that specifically to find out exactly but yes.

73
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:08,300
Because I was like. They were very lucky, and I really thought we'd started doing what you need to write to expose people's capabilities.

74
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:15,870
I didn't see I thought that was what he was describing, but I got up and I just got some really lost hours.

75
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:22,400
She was very specifically defined.

76
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:27,360
I kind of wanted to ask, what does that mean?

77
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:45,160
So this is like I was trying to compress only just because I think it's going to come out on Zoom on one laptop.

78
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:55,340
And then the difficulty that I found a ton of an assumption feeling like a lot of things like children,

79
00:10:55,820 --> 00:11:05,479
how different you have your association with harassment and negative feelings and you kind of have these characteristics of your company by distress.

80
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:11,240
Regarding the behaviors like no confidence, I think I'm considering behavior that I've been trying to implement early,

81
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:19,670
and it's similar to the added criteria regarding request toward the self-evaluation.

82
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:31,580
I want to read by body shape and I want to suggest the slides for 21.6.

83
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:35,740
We spend some time. I just did.

84
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:44,210
I just want to support our effort to just still read some of the literature for me.

85
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:58,370
I kind of think the education that some people like or dislike to you want to understand, but I think it's a better way.

86
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:06,950
This is also some of the questions to be part of what I don't like that something or why it matters.

87
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:15,230
Because if I hear you at some point in an equation, it's 1.6, 1.6% of people want to be diagnosed.

88
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:26,440
Point nine, I would say people at some movies right now, I thought I even got to add, I don't think that is the lifetime limit is.

89
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:36,920
So I would say the only thing that one to is like a quick pass was like, oh, okay, so what would you like to say?

90
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:45,950
Exciting research advice. The lifetime prevalence is 1.6% because the details of like specific rehydration result,

91
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:55,790
one that I didn't know, I think that I catch numbers would say or I,

92
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:02,780
I do like that because then they're together vaccination, they're like closer to what the population percentages are.

93
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:12,170
So I'm just worried about excluding I actually that's all I think that is the ratio between like I just

94
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:23,600
really like age below 32 which I just told you 232 times we receive out of our nation and sorry to report.

95
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:35,850
The reason I write is that I did it when I did and that was for the study in saying that.

96
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:42,470
Yeah, I was just to say yeah I think you need an additional. Yeah I guess you can have.

97
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:49,280
Oh yeah. I was just reading that, I was like I don't sleep at all.

98
00:13:50,030 --> 00:14:08,690
If we were to look across my desk kind of like, yeah, like how do you have any idea what I was like?

99
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:20,480
For years? I swapped out the academic journal and I believe like it like shows like, oh, are you like bipolar population?

100
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:26,610
That means that, you know, we did find some more grace and just me to like narrow as well.

101
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:41,520
I, I think again, you have something that you would find kind of like a bunch of demographic,

102
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:46,580
but I just run through because that's what you have to capture.

103
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:53,330
Yeah. Yeah. You're pretty much like setting up, like, with the crowd, and then you'll,

104
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:58,880
you'll narrow it down and hold in and hone in on, like, my short paragraph in.

105
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:06,910
I guess that's not a solution.

106
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:11,080
I don't know. Okay. Okay. It's just like it's.

107
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,980
It has the paid numbers in here.

108
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:29,380
But then when you actually go to so it is on first page for me and then I might have to call you back to present a total of 60%,

109
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:33,640
less likely slightly lower due to the ad.

110
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:44,530
Oh, why do they have it or do you just have to pay, you know, this criteria and not be able to do the visual diagnosis criteria?

111
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:49,840
Yeah. Is it okay to say with regards or what?

112
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:52,180
I'm just wondering what is said in there that made you say like,

113
00:15:52,940 --> 00:16:03,160
I feel bad because like I just I believe that I wasn't she didn't actually I'm I'm assuming that's true.

114
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:09,040
That's how that would be lower because it has a more weight for that.

115
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:13,600
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So this is prevalent of wonder.

116
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:21,210
Why is it so hard to see if that's you know, actually, I.

117
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:38,170
So I don't know. It was just that that's all families do we want a pandemic that treats couples like and she

118
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:45,070
suggested that we used to make sure that it was like transportation early which I did.

119
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:51,040
Yeah. Yeah I think we should back to the streets may seem extremely small.

120
00:16:51,070 --> 00:17:06,700
I think that I feel that rather than I can be married to 365 which converts to a 0.00.

121
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:10,890
So for this. So I thought that would be so hard.

122
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:14,580
And I said, Oh,

123
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:26,970
I think it's like you see St Jude ads on every kid that's trying to get more evidence and it's not the the publicity and media coverage,

124
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:36,100
even though we have like that for certain things like this next set.

125
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:41,190
So this is an average white woman.

126
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:48,760
How did you find the Senate races, ethnicities, body, sorry, race?

127
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:56,280
Yeah, I guess I'm like I like that it's there.

128
00:17:56,830 --> 00:18:07,750
But I also noticed the same thing with racism that you just have to also kind of that's I think this goes to

129
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:14,630
the question of like when you actually do exercise my my assumption is that understood is common knowledge.

130
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:18,639
I don't know. Yeah.

131
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:25,950
I guess that's your argument. Is that common, though? Well, is there some way we can adjust the population, as I said before,

132
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:31,390
because it's not to mention it's families, but if you don't like the second part, you don't need to say.

133
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:37,780
I'm just saying I'm limited to eating disorders can occur like a million things.

134
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:42,819
You're not thinking, okay, people don't like I don't like the parents.

135
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:48,100
And then I said, yeah. So I'm like, maybe like I have no I mean,

136
00:18:48,100 --> 00:19:00,040
I agreed so wasn't really horrible because that would be the population of a B or just like to see what kind of services can offer you.

137
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:12,220
It's delicious. But I think, like, I think this is for you, you know, as you can say how and then I twist them.

138
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:18,250
So I'm just trying to do that and that is it makes sense.

139
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:26,229
So like I always a kid girls and a lot of taught you know I was 11 to it's called all 1326

140
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:34,270
hours I was like I was less than 95 so we used to do this like if that's even segregation,

141
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:39,780
I don't want to be too specific. I don't want to have to say, yeah, true of all time.

142
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:44,950
Do it like this. Like that.

143
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:53,280
Because I'm working out because I'm trying to just I think, yeah, I think it's better to just say especially something that's going to.

144
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:59,450
Yeah. More common perceptions. Maybe I can change your perception of.

145
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:04,740
And then 2021 and 23. How long is this time?

146
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:16,469
Is that past? Toward the end of this year and all of the challenges are the racial makeup, socioeconomic status and romance.

147
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:19,830
What happens when you turn on counting?

148
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:27,749
The racial makeup is so much less than what we just we moved to a different environment.

149
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:32,340
Just so you know, we're oversight, everything.

150
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:39,540
But for me, it's in the way I found I think also it's again, it's this all summer.

151
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:49,350
Maybe we just need to say how all of this information that would be received but we're not oximetry to primary providers.

152
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:56,790
But for now, let's just keep that in mind. Eating disorders can occur despite.

153
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:01,270
Sorry, go ahead. I just got into eating disorders can occur in individuals.

154
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:07,620
So that constitutes that.

155
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:15,660
Okay. Yeah, there is a thing that I would say it's because you want it to still say.

156
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:23,910
I think there's a lot of this is like you were like despite.

157
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:31,530
Oh yeah, that's just me I guess in pretty poverty.

158
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:38,670
Yeah. Disorders can present individuals all ages, genders, races, I mean, these body shapes, which is totally fine.

159
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:44,330
Just want to make sure that this is your own issue and groups who present with us.

160
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:53,720
So I think that works that not as many non-Hispanic black populations as well as individuals who suffer from major depressive.

161
00:21:53,730 --> 00:22:06,180
It's nice to have oppositional defiant disorder in adolescence, and that's where we start to get rid of that.

162
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:14,570
I was kind of like my onset with my little sister into my drugs,

163
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:23,210
or it might just be I'm confused because this description is a conceptual reality bag option will do or 1212.

164
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:27,180
I don't know if we need to have that, but then next thing is like, Do I love you?

165
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:30,930
Oh, no, no, I'm sorry. I just felt like I was lucky.

166
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:36,840
29 Yeah. I help businesses. I felt like research studies from different countries.

167
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:41,670
They weren't even in the United States. Oh, yeah. So what you were saying in the.

168
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:47,190
So you're saying that you paragraphs which you mention by the LGBTQ community because it's

169
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:56,160
not going to ever want us saying that because suddenly beneficial beneficial for children.

170
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:01,560
So children have to there are a lot of vaccines that have to be like you have to get a child.

171
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:11,370
Yes. Yes. But it is important to note that the risk factors for eating disorders, including genetic components, socio cultural factors,

172
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:25,050
I do agree with you indirectly and like how think they know that you actually have kind of a diagram.

173
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:35,579
I think like because you can always say like in the background data, get back to statistics on incidents,

174
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:44,969
provide a process for that are useful and timeline ideas is trying to figure that out for yourself or not.

175
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:48,990
But I mean you might find it like they actually mean like research.

176
00:23:49,320 --> 00:24:04,590
I like that we know what you get easy to like drive like I would rather read a book rather numbers like a race and agree with my colleague.

177
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:14,390
So we just the I didn't do the name of of running dogs that's what I have long as you know

178
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:19,110
something that I don't even like start with aren't running in person so we can draw.

179
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:23,790
I know the story just to clarify myself.

180
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:34,620
So important to know what it does to someone's thoughts about individual's environment.

181
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:39,660
Yeah, I think it's almost like adolescence in the long term.

182
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:43,830
Negative health effects for individuals promote health and well-being in adults.

183
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:57,450
You ever do special effects that might be helpful, regardless of exceptions to the development of some of these disorders are numerous.

184
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,960
You need the social. We just talked about that.

185
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:10,970
I don't think I want I think I still have that in there to kind of be like I didn't want to hear what you're saying at the end of yours,

186
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:14,580
but then we could just say.

187
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:29,540
Yeah, I think that, you know, we have the too many for some, if you want to say I think it's good because it's just like background.

188
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:37,490
Yeah. Well, you know, he summed it up for our country and showing that long term.

189
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:49,770
Yeah. No, I think he's something else. Long term has always been reduction anxiety, you know.

190
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:59,610
So I'm going to I don't know. I don't know. Like, it should be like this can be depression because you can have all of those things and more.

191
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:06,360
And then another is the long term consequences can include depression and anxiety.

192
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:14,110
Like I don't think I'd be able to provide like.

193
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:24,060
Yeah. I mean, the only thing is that it's going to be at least for some time.

194
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:28,139
Yeah. You know, because generally it's just normal.

195
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:36,260
Routine would be more than necessary cause your children are like, Oh, we have children.

196
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:41,570
Not going to war is wrong. But I just went off on that.

197
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:46,120
Yeah, I'll make that the rest of my session.

198
00:26:46,140 --> 00:27:07,170
I'm on the future shows now for I'm going to move the job in two or three years.

199
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:12,300
Oh, it's like I've been I've been trying to keep it like, just like pretty general for that reason.

200
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:18,020
Like I was just trying to find like overarching facts of kind of like wasn't what it was before to this order.

201
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:26,950
Like, as like actually it's general have seen a bunch of like this for every since adult so it's like

202
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,300
so I'm trying to keep right on because it's not even I actually putting into the documentary.

203
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:36,710
Yeah, some of this is a problem for me.

204
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:43,840
I haven't I just I think it just needs to be include that the center is.

205
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:53,760
Yeah, I know. I don't know. What if you just said what if you just said obesity, high blood pressure like to overwhelm some common outcomes.

206
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:58,310
You're like, this is like food because there's a binge eating component to it.

207
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:10,019
Yes, I think that's what I was trying to say is some of my stuff I have like the URL lists, but like like effects and that head list.

208
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:21,470
So I guess just like thinking ahead and things, I, I don't know, it's like I don't wear face masks.

209
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:29,160
So in general, I was trying to make the addition of like tooth enamel and or if we just want to get rid of that,

210
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:32,969
we can say this to the outcome like all of these things,

211
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:41,000
or use the iris in that to be the cause that my family that I was that it was like five or

212
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:46,679
take out so no we can just remove mean that's right now we can try and we can turn and

213
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:55,050
I want to be very proactive all the time with depression and anxiety and then finding

214
00:28:55,260 --> 00:29:02,489
like the state saw like our research and then also even if we could even flesh that out,

215
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:10,610
if you want to just like look up just a matter of I guess, but that's what I to say.

216
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:16,260
So Kodiak's basically just copying from a different class.

217
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:19,530
I don't have the format for that.

218
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:28,030
Yeah, but I didn't imagine in my head that that's what I'll just fix those two sentences to stick

219
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:33,660
in like other risk factors and make sure that I'm not saying that one size only it's not,

220
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:38,220
oh, I don't even care. I just what I meant to say was,

221
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:48,030
oh you like the psychological reason guys like how different like psychological factors like

222
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:56,480
that but I think it's says in that part of the question what are the public consequences.

223
00:29:56,630 --> 00:30:01,210
Know I was just thinking you had obviously. Education.

224
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:07,920
I mean, I honestly like I feel like, well, anyway, like the psychological research that tries to get out of.

225
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:15,460
Yes. And then I want to be like, I think we're stuck with a bunch of really bad,

226
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:25,230
both along with negative health outcomes lead to significantly higher levels of this population,

227
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:33,090
like individuals with eating disorders have over 5.6 times higher than the general population.

228
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:39,420
At is a building that looks like it doesn't do that.

229
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:52,140
I think that I would just say that like one of the reasons why is not only because my response as I hear it is

230
00:30:52,170 --> 00:31:01,740
asking about health effects stemming from eating disorders across the US health care system over and over and over.

231
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:16,930
So what do you really care about? Because that white paper, 75% of households committing only 7% of their boxes are like them.

232
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:20,330
I mean, I disagree. Yeah.

233
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:32,919
Or a homeless woman policy is a fraction of a second journal, and the other one is sort of like this is kindred's from that paper.

234
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:37,770
The American Sierra. Not I'm not, I'm not.

235
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:43,120
I think you're headed in the right direction only with the majority being productive.

236
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:47,500
You know, I think there's something that I think is the right direction.

237
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:51,500
It's just the experience with today. The same thing. Yeah, exactly.

238
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:58,400
Yeah. Pretty much just me.

239
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:01,450
That's what I was thinking because like the conceptual model.

240
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:11,850
So that would be people who have sort of a how to summarize what you're saying, which is like you.

241
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:18,640
And I'm like, okay, maybe it is like to leave like that time point.

242
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:28,120
I think it's like it's like, yeah,

243
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:41,550
we started out in areas like I think probably if I have 6.7 billion is that our this is where our our productivity was.

244
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:47,440
Yeah, I think you are. That is one of the United States.

245
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:55,450
I avoid thinking about the ability to use specific measure.

246
00:32:55,690 --> 00:33:08,019
Yeah. Because like the way we have it is by square mile I think with an area like have you talked about this before.

247
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:12,640
It just it takes citation format.

248
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:23,980
Like when people are asking about healthcare stemming from eating disorders costs the United

249
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:33,790
States 65 times more likely to be identified or parts in place across the United States combined.

250
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:35,620
Methods we think that would help.

251
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:42,750
Based on your primaries for making the other one, you got to have something like, Why doesn't I just need to exit out of that tab?

252
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:51,860
Because I got a guy going, okay, I'm actually making the AP.

253
00:33:52,000 --> 00:34:06,490
Both of those like sounds like it sounds pretty good, but I guess I can't read it in terms of like stuff we should categorize or text.

254
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:12,159
It is estimating that how the best. I just feel like cause you're in state 65.

255
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:15,570
So I was like, yeah, I'm going to tell you something I know.

256
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:29,620
Like, that doesn't seem like something to be because I'm probably more used to say like under 1865 million, it was like even super or whatever.

257
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:33,050
And I would just, you know, just defining.

258
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:41,370
Were you going to write some of the stuff? Some of the stuff. I have separate separators. I guess we could start focusing on how you see that.

259
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:52,920
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. You know, someone who's like something that I think we're trying like the vehicle $1,000 in costs.

260
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:58,270
So I was just thinking I guess we can separate saying like wanting to take that they didn't really fit.

261
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:22,060
That. Yeah, that's usually like productivity and cost in 2018 is nothing but that everything from change comes to increase it.

262
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:25,830
And so I don't yeah, I'm leaving like Tuesday night.

263
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:35,680
I felt like she didn't do anything just to get out of Ann Arbor here instead of is visiting there revising

264
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:42,900
myself higher than pacifying like so and from what I've seen it's like they on the health care system now.

265
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:51,170
Yeah I was not going to try to buy so I could not afford to see my students at 62 I was like,

266
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:56,549
I was born productivity loss and healthcare costs in 2018 and I was be gone.

267
00:35:56,550 --> 00:36:00,030
But I can still like accidentally I just can't cost per person.

268
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:09,510
And honestly I would be like if we can give our daughters and usually develop an adolescent and we're

269
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:17,430
addressing her you know disorders early is crucial to a healthier and always decreasing mortality and curbing.

270
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:26,050
Yeah I mean it's not like three weeks in advance that it's no,

271
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:36,920
we're not going to have to we're not having these two communities right next to anything like that curve.

272
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:40,080
So that actually works out the exam, the eating disorders.

273
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:47,160
But I think adolescence and early adulthood addressing and they're really not letting rising rates and just

274
00:36:47,160 --> 00:37:01,890
looking at lots of experience so you can share it with your child and only see that we open another minute.

275
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:09,870
No, there's nothing about it. Oh, okay.

276
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:17,080
Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah.

277
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:21,509
And you know, that's the low. All right.

278
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:32,760
I mean, let's hear it. Okay, so I a lot of somebody just looks at it because it's like, yeah, but it's even worse if you want to be on campus.

279
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:38,880
I'm more than happy. Yeah, I think, like, in my head, that's what was really like.

280
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,030
It will, are you how would you like to get one?

281
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:54,690
I mean, the other is kind of a person work with people that regard people have fast motivation was because those wasn't.

282
00:37:55,640 --> 00:38:14,870
Yeah so you just got like the night during like afternoons that were like maybe like a one or two and I think that is so one person, right?

283
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,960
So I think clinic libraries are okay.

284
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:27,620
But you know, I don't think they would ever throw open. They were just going to tell doctors appointments open until something like this.

285
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:44,000
You know I just want spend on week and targeting these kids are understaffed and I don't think that's a problem.

286
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:55,260
Yeah I think if I had, this would be more like, wait a minute, oh, you know, it doesn't mean I'm like,

287
00:38:56,220 --> 00:39:03,560
Oh, yeah, do they have markers or so that would steal something from, you know, like the first wave?

288
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:10,480
Does it get to see? Is that like it would be like that.

289
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:13,650
Right. That's what I see people.

290
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:24,030
Yeah. So yeah. Because in my head I don't see any doctors cause I think that kids who are going to doctors are the ones where now.

291
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:30,750
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. We're not like companies.

292
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:42,240
Like, I don't. Yeah, I think the only way to get the stimulus money out of here, but like,

293
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:47,910
because the doctors aren't like they're not going to capitalize on budget targeting like all three of the like you know the and that

294
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:59,280
in parentheses 55 so that the rest of my but yeah I've never like you know technically was but then there's indigenous and people.

295
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:04,500
Of color. That's what vaccines offer.

296
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:11,100
What can they do? That is what they need to do today.

297
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:21,300
That you're not allowed to tell the world. You're not coming as a candidate so that you're not using your anger mission to get all this kind of stuff.

298
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:27,090
So maybe there's a need to have a correction to try to paraphrase that.

299
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:41,400
You could say the same way. You know, I don't know. I think once you start to go, you want to talk to me first.

300
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:46,200
That's why I just kind of have to try and think about that.

301
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:53,010
Like beginning. Yeah, you are. I'm sorry, but it's to make them ultimately.

302
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:57,960
Yes. We're not there yet.

303
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:04,380
That was my mind. So we're not going to start teaching them how.

304
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:08,630
That's also stigmatizing kids like. Like cruise experience.

305
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:15,060
It was going to sound like a thing. I'm not saying we haven't got to get like a lollipop.

306
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:19,530
I don't know. I'm like, okay, I've been on my hearing tests.

307
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:24,850
Yeah, no, I think everything's cool. I never knew had economic terms like imaginary.

308
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:39,190
It was like six off. And I just didn't know if, like, with the drought, with the things I was like, I was about, oh, my.

309
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:47,640
So we're going to school. Like, there will be, you know, first thing in the morning with your kid if they're not vaccinated.

310
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:53,550
And, you know, like start agreeing to do it and, like, they have to consent to it.

311
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:59,639
Yeah. Right. What are we thinking exactly?

312
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:07,980
As like, how do you feel? Like you may have it done, but, you know, we all just like we like when they do print out those places,

313
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:14,069
like we need to add another opinion that it was like, okay.

314
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:22,229
So I was like, what if you said despite your higher risk for experiencing Yeezy and B and Dan,

315
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:31,139
people would say, Oh, he's calling me and I was like, That makes sense.

316
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:35,190
But that's not really thinking. So like, you just want to maybe.

317
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:36,280
Ah yeah.

318
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:59,640
So I knew that I was like not going to the United States, so the school would have to try to figure it out despite the higher rates of B and C,

319
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:07,220
I was like, you can allow, but I think reporting higher rates of BD and B and than people think that makes more sense.

320
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:08,430
Yeah, it's just moving.

321
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:18,920
That was just like flipping the temporal systems using schools and regret a moderate relationship that there are two different.

322
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:31,499
I know I'm still I'm trying to think it out so speak that you do want Michigan reporting higher rates than there is that other than this.

323
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:40,110
Yeah where you are than people and I think sometimes it seems like this are very confused

324
00:43:42,570 --> 00:43:58,110
about this appears to have to vary from these conventions and that's like other

325
00:43:58,110 --> 00:44:04,709
thing I think like is it policy or our population makes sense because I'm not putting

326
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:12,090
like something there but even a new line of education or something like that.

327
00:44:12,330 --> 00:44:15,390
So is it very troubling within the current?

328
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:23,820
Yeah, we're not sure. Inspired by PNAC, there's a lot of media that creates a been the ESPN people like they have strong

329
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:28,110
relationship and also are less likely to receive resources for prevention.

330
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:39,390
But yeah I think those percentage yeah I don't think that leads to what it's like.

331
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:48,020
And then I think I think what you do is, I think you don't got like it's like how that's what we just established to make it through.

332
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:58,500
I wouldn't move the citation. They're like, it's a citation explaining that I can't tell which ones are true because of c you.

333
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:03,450
Mediator. What can I say? You are like, here is this y exorcism?

334
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:08,100
You know? Well, I thought maybe I'm using the split.

335
00:45:08,270 --> 00:45:13,320
Split? Why should I think they might take a number?

336
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:23,600
So they are, you know, like w h w h what me to in turn fatal if left unchecked, essentially, do you change your mind?

337
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:26,120
And it's like all these things.

338
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:45,350
Just like why I think it's better than, you know, I'm actually because I think I want to be honest, except for one reason or another.

339
00:45:46,170 --> 00:45:52,610
A 20 year old. And it's a choice of children and adolescents.

340
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:57,170
That's a lot of it needed to be made.

341
00:45:57,290 --> 00:46:01,340
Big scandals. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

342
00:46:02,350 --> 00:46:05,630
And I think so. Yeah.

343
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:12,200
Because I don't usually when I have a daughter so many times recently when they were elementary students.

344
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:16,700
I know. Yeah. Because like you had like Yeah.

345
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:27,110
Say, like this person like switched here and it's like, oh, we're going to have like a lot of, you know, the idea of helping somebody.

346
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:31,040
So I've I'll just trend this year.

347
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:38,330
So what do we learn at the same time like okay like started it with everybody else should be

348
00:46:38,330 --> 00:46:43,780
targeted for intervention because and then what would that feel a little bit better right?

349
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:52,790
I was trying to think I was going to my and and Saturday I'm going to be and

350
00:46:52,810 --> 00:47:02,850
and then I was like you or me and bring me on like I didn't answer your phone.

351
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:06,319
I thought those were certain. Yeah.

352
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:12,860
Like for sure. Because as I know that I found that I do, it's like, I don't know.

353
00:47:13,350 --> 00:47:15,860
So that's coming next week?

354
00:47:16,570 --> 00:47:38,090
Oh, I don't think to say that John, that down there for like three days, I think you want to say like are you going to do it yourself.

355
00:47:38,090 --> 00:47:44,749
Is homeless then like we learned that the deaf are going to be homeless.

356
00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:50,870
This is your truth. I don't think you go through some 89 example.

357
00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:53,900
So that cause is your.

358
00:47:56,230 --> 00:47:59,480
You can't wait. Do not.

359
00:48:00,170 --> 00:48:11,680
No, no, no. That's for a PCR test. You cannot get a P what I would recommend against our test within the 90 days we do positive because

360
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:21,100
we were just concerned because of our rewording this now that they rejected you know that it all.

361
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:27,139
Yeah I know that's what we're trying to do.

362
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:32,830
You feel like that is still I don't want to like rewrite your statement. Is that still kind of like what you were getting out of?

363
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:37,160
I never like to get to do a cold PCR. Yeah, I do.

364
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:46,370
And she was like, know is it? And then maybe like she was like she was like an MBA.

365
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:50,600
You write about something like that.

366
00:48:50,600 --> 00:49:06,320
Yeah. Yeah. Or in law school it might be a like you expect like disorder institute psychiatric institute virus paper bag is it make it was sure.

367
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:16,200
Yeah. Yeah, I, I guess I'll just read something that sounds like a lot less likely to be honest about, you know,

368
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:23,650
just sort of the prevalence of you're not supposed to say that, but if it's too specific, we can definitely go back to you.

369
00:49:24,770 --> 00:49:29,990
So I just want to be like very simple, straightforward words.

370
00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:42,559
I'm older and it's not like I don't think, you know, because the other paper has the diagnosis, but I did it.

371
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:48,530
I do not think that like the original sentence also does sound like it needs a citation and we

372
00:49:48,530 --> 00:49:54,820
have to figure out if like there's something like she's got to give her high school for that.

373
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:58,990
Is that enough for three more hours locked out of consideration?

374
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:04,290
So good in that would say great contribution.

375
00:50:04,850 --> 00:50:10,230
Yes, I'm sure it is. But the fetal part is definitely there.

376
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:14,550
We already talked about why it's great. I'm glad that it grew.

377
00:50:14,610 --> 00:50:19,270
Yeah, I totally I'm not the only reason that people read it in some way.

378
00:50:19,290 --> 00:50:22,800
So I like. I just don't know. Yes.

379
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:45,300
Okay. No. I mean, he's right. It's like I don't want my chapter moderate to be like he just started living excluded from the house.

380
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:59,460
And I guess that, like, I like classroom two, three, five years later, I feel like, you know,

381
00:50:59,490 --> 00:51:10,110
I love I don't want to I don't want to see, you see, because I could not necessarily live with this feeling.

382
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:16,480
Various people feel that there is a mortality rate that you just said is the source right for?

383
00:51:16,870 --> 00:51:20,100
We're good. I think we're covered on that. We have a goal for like what?

384
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:39,260
What your question is, is it like it's like you enter into a thing which which is like is the same like which is like you're not.

385
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:44,040
Yeah, who cares? Anyway, I'm sorry.

386
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:47,879
I don't really want everybody to be connected.

387
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:59,160
Me, I say to you, that's why I like reading aloud to all of you when I do your style that it's not that for them.

388
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:05,550
It's like, well, it's here. Because if left unchecked, it's, I think we're all separate.

389
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:18,900
So it's a great this is how I write, but it's not actually like you don't know how crazy like I was about about a month ago when I was like,

390
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:31,500
we're making exceptions for First Nations folks to continue vaccination.

391
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:40,860
But I think that I'm always I mean, sometimes same thing.

392
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:46,240
You see that it's not so much that on 91 this is a useful thing.

393
00:52:46,410 --> 00:52:51,840
Yeah. You have to do this where you show, you see.

394
00:52:54,430 --> 00:52:58,510
How do you think uniform out? I feel like I'm always.

395
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:04,150
You're able to tell me that? Like, how how did that happen?

396
00:53:04,150 --> 00:53:14,390
So many different forms of chronic a chronic ACA that has been treated, I think is our first.

397
00:53:14,430 --> 00:53:23,930
Right, because that's a part of changes to how we die.

398
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:31,299
And once we saw that Amazon,

399
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:37,660
our research saying that it was interesting to see how it was how the fact that how they became

400
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:50,550
homeless documented untreated suicides and then didn't get treatment because the way that helped.

401
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:57,640
Okay so like a citation so that.

402
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:03,130
So the part about your meeting, if you go back to the other day,

403
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:13,020
how do you go from I can see it's the second I'm doing will get better because like I think it'd be easier for you to press and say,

404
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:17,049
gee, I love that format because in the past,

405
00:54:17,050 --> 00:54:32,410
like I understand if that's the way that there was this coming home and it just loaded in with this website.

406
00:54:32,410 --> 00:54:42,520
But yeah, I just didn't know because there's a small connection. But if it's if it doesn't have an auditorium, well, maybe that's actually the same.

407
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:47,410
I think it's like that's your conversation.

408
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:52,960
But intoxication for like that's what I used to you do based through it.

409
00:54:53,110 --> 00:55:02,349
Let me slaughter your verse. Exactly. So if you reference this person first, you know, like it's my hope that would be I mean,

410
00:55:02,350 --> 00:55:11,620
we could just use the citations to the website to document or sources from the Internet and they literally save the day taxes.

411
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:18,250
So we talk about these three, okay, we just do this and we're fine.

412
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:31,630
I was going to on this format early this year, according to Real Time Learning Style Guide,

413
00:55:32,130 --> 00:55:36,790
is going to just ask you if you're going to do that through this thing.

414
00:55:37,610 --> 00:55:41,850
So I guess for us in particular then yeah,

415
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:53,560
because we get that all from the door and that's what really happened early on that have for a whole different population is kind of like.

416
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:57,810
The toll in this instance,

417
00:55:57,820 --> 00:56:08,900
like I think your momma does mention disorder or anxiety that would be finished that paragraph and I had to try to figure out how to explain that.

418
00:56:08,990 --> 00:56:16,420
And I think that that is if you go back to that, is Dr. King any better?

419
00:56:16,930 --> 00:56:22,320
I do not know that we can make. Okay.

420
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:26,889
I'm the wrong guy. I know that.

421
00:56:26,890 --> 00:56:30,250
So it's good attitude and motivation to see the moderator.

422
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:34,150
I'm a little because of their votes for the second me,

423
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:41,400
but this isn't as well as to be evaluated in order to find the best methods to address the challenges.

424
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:48,380
I talk as it relates to me, correct me if I'm wrong, but that was relating to something that we edited down like.

425
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:59,520
So you would probably just have like a book, like you have it, you have something you really want to mediate it or you can like all back.

426
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:08,930
But I guess this is to focus on because it must occur in order to find the best mechanism.

427
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:16,120
So I guess makes it easier to essentially compulsive eating disorders.

428
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:20,410
And I see how other disorders are helping me because I need to use it.

429
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:29,350
So I it at baseline but like interesting as it relates to interest,

430
00:57:29,790 --> 00:57:35,140
I'm trying to think about it in my own and then later I guess you do like turn around and then apply.

431
00:57:35,190 --> 00:57:41,730
It has to be evaluated in order to find the best methods to address the challenges of.

432
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:55,890
Because my basic understanding of adolescence and why this relationship has no understanding is how do you know it in order to find the best.

433
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:59,380
But I would say that's more a adolescent. Yeah,

434
00:57:59,470 --> 00:58:08,690
that's what has been true for moderator is like what how does this change that they can I tell you and

435
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:15,410
that is out of interventions historically but I think as long as it's clear that people will tell you.

436
00:58:16,510 --> 00:58:25,030
Yeah. And then yeah I think that makes sense because we're saying like they need to

437
00:58:25,030 --> 00:58:28,419
be targeted because they've historically been excluded from treatment only.

438
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:37,440
So you need to evaluate why they got to find the best methods to address this using many positive ones that make sense.

439
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:47,110
So these groups who get all of these results, do you want to come back?

440
00:58:47,110 --> 00:58:51,280
And I like coverage. And I mean, you can think about it.

441
00:58:51,630 --> 00:58:58,270
Think we need to go on to the biggest piece of matter is Cassie, this dropout.

442
00:58:58,940 --> 00:59:03,320
It's all related. This is like a factor about what is in changes.

443
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:07,510
I just wrote more than what it is. So what's the difference between sections?

444
00:59:08,110 --> 00:59:12,760
So much so like so you have. Yeah.

445
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:23,580
And I'm not sure what other relevant characteristics you have considered countries and others, so I don't even know what it means.

446
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:29,439
I hate when people use words like it and that's in our education.

447
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:36,790
Wikipedia. Yeah, I was so excited.

448
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:41,780
It's. What do you think?

449
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:47,060
I think we did. We did everything right now, which is like.

450
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:56,810
It's like how it is. Yeah. So it's like CDC and then the people I don't know which you can say it like, but I guess like extended treatment.

451
00:59:56,820 --> 01:00:01,060
And then there's still what date that sounds one paragraph to describe it.

452
01:00:01,970 --> 01:00:07,040
And I'm going to say you should be treated like you were ordered to treat.

453
01:00:07,130 --> 01:00:10,480
So I just that continues to grow.

454
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:20,990
So how did you see how treatment it the difference between like I want to go through what you have it so that we can circle back.

455
01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:31,120
So I just want to just drop it in there because I'm wondering with anxiety have like people wondering whether.

456
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:35,590
Nice. Oh, sorry. I know it's easy to do with it.

457
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:44,600
All right. So I was looking at it, but I was like, I thought it was I thought it was because it never seems like an outcome,

458
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:49,820
but it's how we all say it's just not directly.

459
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:57,200
Yeah. It's like you're changing the outcome that, like, right there and it's kind of like your passing is always just always immediate.

460
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:03,919
Or like the moderator is saying that they didn't see evidence of the most effective methods

461
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:17,420
for different reasons or different groups like if you want to be part of this differentially

462
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:27,620
impacting my I had a discussion impact certain people I heard about anxiety with certain

463
01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:34,460
attitudes and belief versus them although they're like I can see of identifying hundred down.

464
01:01:35,180 --> 01:01:39,229
This is kind of like you're right this is part mediator.

465
01:01:39,230 --> 01:01:44,170
You can think about whether this is the way we can figure out who gets the moderator.

466
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:49,420
It's like because they're interested, they really think about it.

467
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:56,150
It's like the why it made that. And then the same people come back that same way, different than us.

468
01:01:56,310 --> 01:02:00,670
So I was like, What is it about awareness? It's just relationship.

469
01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:10,639
I just felt like I'm probably like concrete in how to put it in right now.

470
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:17,660
I think how does the moderator. So I think that's really starting off to address.

471
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:35,120
Are you feeling like I don't really have a good program on non primary prevention program in the street for it and you know,

472
01:02:36,590 --> 01:02:43,520
I just found the word transposition like an instrument.

473
01:02:43,850 --> 01:02:47,880
The Scottish farming is something that you know.

474
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:54,650
MODERATOR And all of that we had a quick oh yes no problem.

475
01:02:55,100 --> 01:02:59,760
I mean, it's okay but then it's that's the case.

476
01:03:00,140 --> 01:03:02,310
I do think I think the order is a little bit off.

477
01:03:02,310 --> 01:03:09,080
But again, I think it's you want this bottom, it's like these are also things that wouldn't be affected by this.

478
01:03:09,290 --> 01:03:16,040
But essentially my research is just like it's like buying, you know, I think that's the issue.

479
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:23,059
Somebody say something if they feel action, but I think that's a good understanding of the near term.

480
01:03:23,060 --> 01:03:28,879
Too far. Yeah. Wow. Knowing more about the differences.

481
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:32,940
Okay, I'm like, what is this nature?

482
01:03:33,590 --> 01:03:39,919
Actually listening to technical exam and feeling like I'm going to struggle with that.

483
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:43,160
But in my brain, that's how I think about implications in one sentence.

484
01:03:43,310 --> 01:03:49,820
But yeah, this would also have an effect on this dollar. For instance, I could get that link next eventually is the one in 24.

485
01:03:50,220 --> 01:03:54,600
Yeah. What are the prevention initiatives here are the prevention.

486
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:59,510
That's the word I was. I'm scared. It was like a little rough at first.

487
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:02,410
But as you said, I understood.

488
01:04:02,420 --> 01:04:11,780
I learned something like, oh, come on, I don't I don't know if I need to go into that much or risk their lives, but you can tell right here.

489
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:18,049
So I tried to, but I thinking like, well, maybe that's okay.

490
01:04:18,050 --> 01:04:24,680
Maybe that's our distal outcome. I think you use subjects except you motivated instead of that elevated risk or mortality.

491
01:04:25,130 --> 01:04:27,370
I think I mean that. Yeah, I guess. What,

492
01:04:27,650 --> 01:04:38,810
are you just going to go back and say this or just make a promise and the presentation or that was something which was the that decades and we did it.

493
01:04:40,550 --> 01:04:44,000
Something. Yes, because I here's where before we go to the next part,

494
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:51,730
if they don't have a gun and the other one's one of several central, all would be one or more health related outcomes.

495
01:04:52,130 --> 01:04:55,580
Public health related. You should include the press on this little thing.

496
01:04:55,580 --> 01:05:03,080
I wonder where I would assume that we all agree on our prevention of eating disorders.

497
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:06,530
We're not trying to change and maybe also treatment.

498
01:05:06,590 --> 01:05:14,420
And you want an example of something where I'd just go out and that would be Yeah, well, yeah.

499
01:05:15,190 --> 01:05:19,970
Death or so. Simcoe, they got a lot of problematic health complications.

500
01:05:20,510 --> 01:05:25,900
That's how I ended. So, yeah, you could just take the measures in the second case.

501
01:05:26,060 --> 01:05:29,660
That's a lot of things. I'm sure you do. And I was just.

502
01:05:30,290 --> 01:05:36,780
Just thinking, this is. I was hired to do what I know.

503
01:05:37,730 --> 01:05:45,590
The first one to the second one I think is I think we can, because I know we have to sort of reset into,

504
01:05:45,620 --> 01:05:52,429
I think, a lot of our our targets and intervention programs to me, prevention and treatment.

505
01:05:52,430 --> 01:05:59,810
But also like when I get home, I my getting prevention knowledge in treatment programs and then our it is like that.

506
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:06,670
So outcome is reducing mortality you know what is fine and they get involved frankly I like that.

507
01:06:06,710 --> 01:06:14,210
I just was like that would be too simple. We just we've got to we got to kind of combine some of those into interesting part of their policies.

508
01:06:14,210 --> 01:06:21,710
Actually, that would be anything that expert whenever moderation says outlined.

509
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:30,200
Okay. So I think they have to have at least supposedly we're supposed to have four,

510
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:38,030
but we can have a fifth one because we have the the first paragraph is literally just the DSM explanation of what's in the DNR.

511
01:06:38,450 --> 01:06:43,550
And I asked her, is that okay? Yes. So I think that makes sense.

512
01:06:43,970 --> 01:06:48,820
Keeping number 15 and health insurance saying you should have scholarships.

513
01:06:49,810 --> 01:06:55,770
Oh, I know. I just read my second one and then my punch card isn't working right now.

514
01:06:55,780 --> 01:07:01,370
How about that's why I think I mean, the way I see it is that you have a lot of stuff that we're going to use.

515
01:07:01,370 --> 01:07:05,130
It sounds like. I don't know, because then you're it doesn't really matter for us.

516
01:07:05,150 --> 01:07:08,430
That's true. I keep forgetting we're going to like expand the list resources on.

517
01:07:08,670 --> 01:07:14,940
Yes, but we have to try them for something that we can all make,

518
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:31,460
which is Google have like it that was sort of taken out of I don't know what I was with you know probably know we're pretty sure other yeah I believe

519
01:07:31,790 --> 01:07:47,299
like your first case is another I did you know psychological treatment for like things being characterized by deficit control and feelings of guilt,

520
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:51,860
shame and embarrassment. Psychotherapy is successful in these treatment.

521
01:07:52,490 --> 01:07:59,510
Adolescent adaptations and CBT demonstrated significantly your abstinence and binge eating episodes

522
01:07:59,510 --> 01:08:06,550
and improvements in body shape and weight related concerns delivered the majority of user.

523
01:08:06,590 --> 01:08:15,230
I mean, psychotherapy. We definitely do not need that.

524
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:21,400
For both of you. Just like covering your bus.

525
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:22,930
We don't have.

526
01:08:25,540 --> 01:08:39,130
Truly appropriate nutrition counseling and body image discussions are central to this, not just outcome risk among racial, ethnic group and calorie.

527
01:08:40,830 --> 01:08:43,840
I'm not sure. Just put it in there. Right, parents? Right.

528
01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:48,860
This is really. Well, let me see. Your book should look communities.

529
01:08:49,090 --> 01:09:03,150
This is about plagiarism, which is, like you say, the big funding guys are like, we got to individualize these individualized psychiatric class.

530
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:10,670
I think we should maybe cut down our ability to treatment programs and streamline everything.

531
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:17,700
You know, I'm like, that's something that okay, oh, you have marble with that problem statements.

532
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:21,579
I'm going to look to be we're going to make this work. Okay.

533
01:09:21,580 --> 01:09:31,180
So when I go to those the perfect technicians, because that can become I just think it is, I guess, the experience.

534
01:09:31,180 --> 01:09:34,299
And I, I don't need to risk mortality.

535
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:38,130
We could just could be like, this is the same thing.

536
01:09:38,170 --> 01:09:47,410
I hope that we want to that three years in a row and I'm a safer so I'm totally different realities and yeah just kind of seeking out

537
01:09:47,430 --> 01:10:04,510
the structure of the all through that I just like I like your real goal so that's what that's the structure I'd say as an outcome.

538
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:08,860
You've got time. You know what you do if you're to observe.

539
01:10:11,130 --> 01:10:16,100
Yeah, the proximal outcome is great.

540
01:10:19,380 --> 01:10:31,200
Should I still do a room full of intense criticism, which is not for somebody like me?

541
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:38,370
Yeah, we'll come back to that, if that's. I would say that's insane.

542
01:10:38,670 --> 01:10:43,170
We decided to meet and I do like this.

543
01:10:44,370 --> 01:10:50,730
I think that's a great point. But we'll talk about our footnote and then you address it.

544
01:10:52,350 --> 01:10:56,030
Subscribe, even as with an intervention.

545
01:10:58,140 --> 01:11:03,460
I know. It's like, oh, thank you, sir.

546
01:11:06,660 --> 01:11:14,070
I read the other one. It's just really it's great because you talk about sticking with that.

547
01:11:15,010 --> 01:11:23,730
That's why I think that we should definitely have that in there. And like, it sounds like that is great.

548
01:11:23,900 --> 01:11:30,180
Okay. Yeah, that's right. I think they're they're just really what have you kind of taking behavioral whatever.

549
01:11:30,450 --> 01:11:35,420
That's where you're separate critically. Okay.

550
01:11:35,430 --> 01:11:39,719
Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Yeah.

551
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:43,710
This is your separation where you are, not. You know, you're sitting there.

552
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:52,560
Yeah. So, I mean, so that's kind of okay if she is saying, I know that's pretty cool.

553
01:11:53,010 --> 01:11:56,310
But yeah, I guess getting out of you want to get out?

554
01:11:58,220 --> 01:12:01,860
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I think.

555
01:12:01,860 --> 01:12:17,460
I think it's like, yes, let's do that, because I can't even imagine.

556
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:22,830
All right. So first we have.

557
01:12:27,060 --> 01:12:30,750
Should I just. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm sorry.

558
01:12:31,630 --> 01:12:39,900
You saw me before I got into a health supervision accident with a child.

559
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:53,300
And that just me. And you're holding back? Yeah, that's what we have to get together, because we need to turn this guy and say, you.

560
01:12:55,380 --> 01:13:00,930
She has that next one or this one's for exercise in school.

561
01:13:01,260 --> 01:13:05,430
Yeah, exactly. Which is why we're doing it.

562
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:12,160
I would just kind of jump over things that are acceptable.

563
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:16,250
I think that's okay. Yeah. Like I'm going to. Right.

564
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:28,620
Education's. The broad clear.

565
01:13:29,290 --> 01:13:45,060
There's not a list of incentives on screen, but I think it's at this point in school annual school health exams.

566
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:51,719
Yeah. Yeah. Or social norms.

567
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:57,300
Social decisions. They don't understand vaccination.

568
01:13:57,630 --> 01:14:15,150
We're working on that it right now because we're not in on the revolution or let's say, pretending to do that.

569
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:20,460
Normally I would say yes, but I just think the thing to separate for this and not try another,

570
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:31,560
you know, because we all believe like that for person to tackle the nation there, then so be it.

571
01:14:32,290 --> 01:14:37,740
I don't know. I just I think, you know.

572
01:14:38,250 --> 01:14:44,210
Media. Media. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

573
01:14:50,980 --> 01:15:03,180
I think people get somewhat seriously convince me that that's really trying to expand

574
01:15:03,660 --> 01:15:12,870
attention initiatives act to reduce the total deaths so programing disorders.

575
01:15:13,170 --> 01:15:26,220
You've got to do that for the year in your school health exams pre-party and get to know about depression and you just kind of go experience that.

576
01:15:27,750 --> 01:15:31,080
I think that's fine for prevention or not. You don't believe in them.

577
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:36,530
Then I would do those in the room in which I did.

578
01:15:37,170 --> 01:15:42,330
I don't think I'm going to go somewhere.

579
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:50,790
I'll go. Okay. Let's go to a lot of the early and not looking at touching on it.

580
01:15:50,970 --> 01:15:55,890
But I think in terms of understanding of like I agree like, you know,

581
01:15:56,730 --> 01:16:05,440
healthy lifestyles and you have to stay there kind of take that out a little bit certainly for superiors

582
01:16:05,490 --> 01:16:12,660
is good by enhancing awareness decreasing speaking to seeking and I think that's the first to speak.

583
01:16:12,810 --> 01:16:16,770
Yeah, we're just like brainstorming. Yeah, that's too.

584
01:16:16,770 --> 01:16:20,040
And then we just need to do treatment. Yeah, we can. We can do this, major.

585
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:24,880
We can put them down. No, no, no.

586
01:16:24,900 --> 01:16:30,960
I think it's, you know, because you're touching on this, you know, touching on that.

587
01:16:31,050 --> 01:16:36,400
Like, why did they pursue clinical? Maybe we need to collaborate by the people you're trying to assist us.

588
01:16:36,420 --> 01:16:49,010
Because it is. Yeah. So then you're just thinking, oh, well, prevention is the option.

589
01:16:49,060 --> 01:16:54,240
We have knowledge and awareness check. Now we need treatment and then we need the final one to be.

590
01:16:54,610 --> 01:17:02,600
I think this works to prevent mortality and long term things, but they never excited about it under social norm.

591
01:17:02,610 --> 01:17:06,000
Yes. All right, children, we're all the same. You have to be a code.

592
01:17:06,010 --> 01:17:11,610
You can be very dangerous. And, you know, it's great.

593
01:17:11,670 --> 01:17:19,260
You better damage it, much easier to tear it down. And I'm waiting for your press to read it.

594
01:17:19,290 --> 01:17:24,330
Somebody interrupted and Cassie goes to care.

595
01:17:24,370 --> 01:17:29,890
So I think the end of our lives like so good just to hear my name with the side effects from.

596
01:17:29,910 --> 01:17:36,170
But I was in trouble for a while. I was waiting for you. Like also you goes through like so much like from the other side.

597
01:17:36,180 --> 01:17:40,880
It's just like a website you want to join, like one class, but getting that bad.

598
01:17:41,250 --> 01:17:45,180
Yeah. I'm sorry. Three more hours. I was going to get pneumonia.

599
01:17:46,380 --> 01:18:00,180
Gosh. Here is a description of my time here.

600
01:18:00,220 --> 01:18:10,330
Mostly because I can not take such a talk to him.

601
01:18:12,100 --> 01:18:17,709
You mean like I didn't want you to.

602
01:18:17,710 --> 01:18:29,770
Like I had to teach you? Like Whitmire needed to admit that I know of experience and belonging.

603
01:18:30,190 --> 01:18:33,489
Also, where did you get it from? Literacies, you know.

604
01:18:33,490 --> 01:18:37,780
And no one else does.

605
01:18:37,930 --> 01:18:41,000
You could just say, like, we're not clear.

606
01:18:41,090 --> 01:18:44,260
We are like, Oh, okay.

607
01:18:44,590 --> 01:18:51,159
So that's why. Good, good. Yes, I your final thought only needs to be one.

608
01:18:51,160 --> 01:18:55,389
Ten years ago, sleep rape prevention and spreading knowledge,

609
01:18:55,390 --> 01:19:12,870
awareness and three controls for practices reduced risk of more long term risk according to the long pair's output of 40 years.

610
01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:21,870
You have? Yes. It's just that it's like a better than 30 seconds.

611
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:27,340
This is just because I don't look like this.

612
01:19:27,830 --> 01:19:34,120
I'm sure this is the problem.

613
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:39,820
It looks like we're literally just going to like why it's a good job.

614
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:55,630
It's functioning for the of prevention, and it's pretty good if they want to take the time to.

615
01:19:55,870 --> 01:20:03,600
Thank you. Thank you so much. I'm so sorry I wasn't there.

616
01:20:04,650 --> 01:20:09,910
I always say, yeah. You can also just go to your resume if you want.

617
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:16,150
I think it is pretty nasty. And because that is the answer.

618
01:20:17,710 --> 01:20:28,150
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

619
01:20:30,310 --> 01:20:38,690
Well, I would have added that pronounced basis, which we recognize over it.

620
01:20:39,540 --> 01:20:48,310
I need to explain. Do you have a plan or want someone to go through it?

621
01:20:48,490 --> 01:20:52,120
But it doesn't really matter.

622
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:55,930
I don't think we need to do everything.

623
01:20:56,530 --> 01:21:04,060
When you just report this, we all just make a point to like, she didn't do it by this time.

624
01:21:05,470 --> 01:21:10,510
Questions for people chat. And then we can all just consume attacks like dismemberment.

625
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:16,760
I think we incorporate references. Reference. Yes, one of them is.

626
01:21:17,560 --> 01:21:22,630
Thank you. Oh, I know, I know.

627
01:21:24,660 --> 01:21:28,900
Will you do it at some point? I posted. That's good.

628
01:21:29,220 --> 01:21:37,580
I just know how I feel. I feel like I want to just be this Friday.

629
01:21:38,110 --> 01:21:55,840
I didn't really know, you know, before I learned how to write over.

630
01:21:58,470 --> 01:22:04,000
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, look, it's like.

631
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:12,130
Well, it's needed sometimes, but I really like Russian, so it's sort of the sport you played.

632
01:22:12,640 --> 01:22:20,320
But I realize that it's like, here and turn it on so you won't get hurt, but we usually don't want to wait on it.

633
01:22:20,680 --> 01:22:27,660
I don't know. It looks like you're you get it.

634
01:22:28,070 --> 01:22:43,380
You don't have to go through what happens and we'll decide on your health and they're there or not.

635
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:54,520
I'm going to go to work. You ask a lot of folks here.

636
01:22:54,820 --> 01:22:58,410
All right. Yes. All right.

637
01:23:00,280 --> 01:23:07,340
Younger than me. What would you say? You know, I'm so sorry I had to draw jobs for a while.

638
01:23:08,050 --> 01:23:11,800
I was doing my, like, marketing stuff. And then I also was working as a student coach.

639
01:23:12,220 --> 01:23:14,400
Stop thinking about new students.

640
01:23:15,490 --> 01:23:27,480
So I started tutoring and I was just like, I know that standardized tests are like weeds, but it's like, okay, they work, right?

641
01:23:27,730 --> 01:23:31,540
The first I do, I actually learned grammar.

642
01:23:32,730 --> 01:23:36,040
And I was like, okay, I can understand.

643
01:23:36,050 --> 01:23:42,010
And I understand it well enough to teach somebody else. But the problem with those tests is like you're not actually learning.

644
01:23:42,020 --> 01:23:47,930
You're just telling them how to do, like, type music. Like, sounds like that type people don't remember anything, so.

645
01:23:49,930 --> 01:23:55,440
Yeah. I think you're right.

646
01:23:56,150 --> 01:24:00,010
You are right. I feel like we're doing okay.

647
01:24:00,460 --> 01:24:06,900
We have until Friday when everybody seems to know ACA.

648
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:18,520
I don't know API. Yeah, but you say like let's see a demo edit once.

649
01:24:18,910 --> 01:24:22,450
Are you around? I know you don't. You live in Ypsilanti.

650
01:24:22,670 --> 01:24:27,070
You're working on the communication.

651
01:24:27,140 --> 01:24:39,400
Some stuff at some point this weekend. You'd be interested to know if you're okay this weekend.

652
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:46,200
Okay. We'll probably be Sunday because Saturday. I know. Because I look for you on the site.

653
01:24:46,210 --> 01:24:50,200
I pretty much I'm on a Saturday most a good Friday Sunday.

654
01:24:51,250 --> 01:24:55,809
My colleague you know what we think even I mean, I'm fine with jumping on it.

655
01:24:55,810 --> 01:24:59,756
I just thought it would be helpful if we all looked at each other's, like, visual.
