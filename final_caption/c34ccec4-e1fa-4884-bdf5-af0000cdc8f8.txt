1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:13,370
I think that's probably why it was such a good time, because we were sometimes.

2
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:24,680
I think the fact that you've gone is just I'm pretty sure I'm.

3
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:30,530
I know I do. For one. Yeah. So I don't know what was gonna say this.

4
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:38,420
I didn't think it was a monster out in the water.

5
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:46,880
Just give me one. Keep that in mind as you grab it myself, I.

6
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:51,180
I guess I go back to the whole it again. Wow.

7
00:00:51,720 --> 00:01:02,300
Y you can turn it off and try to turn it off.

8
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:06,209
I guess I try one all the time.

9
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:11,160
It's my right. I don't use it.

10
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:19,139
Yeah, I think everyone is feeling good about their pocketbook.

11
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,420
Yes, that's true. Yeah.

12
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:35,050
And some people say we are different.

13
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:43,890
That's got to be what you get for the voice commands.

14
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,390
Good morning. Good morning. I'm doing a small crowd today.

15
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,210
Concentrate. Before we start,

16
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:04,260
I'm going to go over something that might be useful for the problems that you remember when we talked about how

17
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:10,620
you can kind of create a and insured demand curve for an uninsured demand or somebody at a co-insurance rate.

18
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:14,729
And then we start off by doing that sort of point by point translation and saying,

19
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:20,400
well, that's their co-insurance rate of 20% and out of pocket price of ten.

20
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:23,910
That would be equivalent to a full price of 50.

21
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,429
So we can translate that and say, well,

22
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:32,190
we think the first and I think numbers up the doctor fund said last time people don't care about health care costs,

23
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:37,350
people care about health care costs. And that's really kind of an exact illustration of that.

24
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,459
Inflation from the uninsured to the insured demand curve is sort of making that

25
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:45,800
assumption that people are going to respond to what their out-of-pocket costs.

26
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:57,660
So uninsured a full price of $10 per unit is exactly equivalent to me of a price of $50 per unit if I have insurance with a 20% insurance rate.

27
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:03,090
So I predict I ought to buy the same quantity if I had no insurance and had to pay $10,

28
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:09,750
or if I had that insurance policy and the price were 50, which therefore means I have to pay $10.

29
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:16,290
So that's going back to Dr. Vedder exploit of people don't care about what health care costs, they care about what it costs them.

30
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:24,569
So let's kind of just do that with the actual demand equation and see how we do it algebraically and we'll see

31
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:30,240
that it's going to give us the exact same answer as that point to point and that will point to point translation.

32
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:35,730
We were just kind of doing it graphically. We did it originally by plugging in some numbers, trying to draw a new graph,

33
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:41,700
and we said there is an alternative way of thinking about all of that sort of pivoting of the demand curve towards the vertical.

34
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:49,829
And the more generous the insurance policy is, the more price inelastic the insured demand curve would be, the closer to the vertical,

35
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:57,560
the perfectly inelastic, which would be the case if you had literally 100% coverage, because then you would say, Well, what does care cost me?

36
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:10,000
It doesn't matter what the price of care is, it costs me nothing. So let's start with the demand curve equals 100 minus five.

37
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,960
Q We could also solve this for. Q And the equivalent expressions.

38
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:28,920
Q As a function of the. It's all for Q3 20 minus point two.

39
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:33,870
So we've got two equivalent expressions of the demand for if you want to write

40
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,520
this price as a function of quantity or quantity as a function of price.

41
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:42,600
So it is completely equivalent versions. So now let's graph this.

42
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:57,409
What is the quantity intercept going to be? We just want one, right?

43
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:03,200
Because if the quantity Aricept is saying essentially, what quantity would I choose if price were zero?

44
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:08,410
So using this expression, it's easy to do that plug in zero four price and we just get 20.

45
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:15,860
And what is the price that are going to be? 100.

46
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:22,220
100. So there you can do it from this is standard Y equals m x plus V for where it gets really off there.

47
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,559
Or you can use the economic logic and say, well,

48
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:31,880
the prices of intercept is the quantity that I would or the the price at which I would choose a quantity of zero.

49
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:36,290
Nor is the price just high enough that I say I'm out well.

50
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:41,900
So plug in a quantity of zero and you get 200 C either do it by the math and saying, well,

51
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:47,540
in this forum that's going to be the X intercept in this form that's required to separate do with the economics and say,

52
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:51,709
well, yes, intercept means what quantity where I choose the price of zero.

53
00:05:51,710 --> 00:06:01,760
So plug in people zero. And the price intercept is what at what price would I basically drop out of the market with my quantity fall to zero.

54
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:10,460
So you plug in zero for two. So you either do it with the economic logic or the simple math logic of intercepts.

55
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:18,590
Okay. So there is my uninsured demand curve. So let's just take one point.

56
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:20,350
Let's say the price is $50.

57
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:34,830
Where you had a quantity of tab in the price of 50 here and it's going to be 20 -0.2 times 50 is minus ten and I get a quantity of ten.

58
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:37,860
So that's one particular point on my uninsured demand curve.

59
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:44,939
And now it's with like like we did in class a couple of weeks ago. Let's plug in an insurance policy.

60
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:54,720
Let's say suppose the person faces 25% coinsurance so they pay a quarter and insurance pays three quarters.

61
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:07,100
If we do that point by point translation, one price is going to be equivalent to 50 uninsured.

62
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:11,600
Here is what price? If it were, the price of care would leave me with $50 out of pocket.

63
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:18,140
If I've got 75% coverage and I'm responsible for 25 to 200.

64
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:26,930
Multiply that by four. I'm paying a quarter of it. So to me, I feel exactly the same about how much care I want to use.

65
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:31,820
If I don't have this insurance policy and I have face the price of 50,

66
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:40,570
or if I did have that insurance policy and I face a price of 200, because that would leave me with that out of pocket price of $0.50.

67
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,620
That's the way we did it a couple of weeks ago.

68
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:50,030
And we could manage to do it through a whole bunch of points that eventually drive the demand curve up and we simply escape the equation of it.

69
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:56,960
So we didn't have to like drive down 100 points and you multiply 0.2 by 0.25.

70
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:08,480
So basically when I have this insurance policy, whatever the original price is, my out-of-pocket price is point to five times P.

71
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:24,080
So I can really do is I can just substitute y25 times PS for P because that's all that translation is.

72
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,400
Well, I'm whatever the price is, I only pay a quarter of that.

73
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:32,750
So the price I feel is 1 to 5 times the full price.

74
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:38,180
So what I'm going to argue is that, well, if we just plug in point two, 5 p.m.,

75
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:44,150
place a p, we're going to have our vision for the full insured demand curve.

76
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:51,139
And then we can check that by saying once we do that math, we argue that this is one of the points that should be on that curve.

77
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:53,390
We can check is that point actually on that equation.

78
00:08:54,590 --> 00:09:01,040
And if it is, then we can kind of be confident that now we've got a mathematical version of that entire insured demand curve.

79
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:17,060
And so what would that demand curve be? So 0.2 times point to 5.05.

80
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:24,280
We're not surprisingly, it's a quarter as big. Your original coefficient is point two on price.

81
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:28,880
Now it's .05 because I'm only responding to a quarter of the price.

82
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:35,180
So when I check this is this particular point, a price of 200, a quantity of ten.

83
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:40,140
On this equation. It's going to be on that line.

84
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:45,060
Right. So plug in, for example, a price of 200.

85
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:55,110
Here I get 20 minus point oh, five times 1500 is 20 minus ten.

86
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:01,110
And bingo, I've got that quantity of tests. So now I can confirm that.

87
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,340
Yeah, this makes sense. The way we did it a couple of weeks ago,

88
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:08,100
we introduced the idea of how you create an insured demand curve from an uninsured

89
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:14,370
demand curve by sort of plugging in some points or equivalently by sort of rotating the

90
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:20,759
curve up towards the vertical and stopping when you're sort of got gotten the fraction

91
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:26,040
of that angle rotation is going to give us the same thing if you do it mathematically.

92
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,729
So you're going to have an equation, a problem in your problem set where you're going to have to do this.

93
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,559
You have to start with an uninsured demand curve.

94
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:36,750
And one part of the problem that's going to be if you have a coinsurance rate now, how do you get the insured demand curve from it?

95
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:41,970
So that's kind of a simple way of doing it is say if I've got my uninsured demand curve.

96
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:48,889
I'm just going to substitute sea time speed in this case .25 times PE in place of

97
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:54,260
PE because that translates how the full price if I have this insurance policy.

98
00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:02,860
Turns into buy out of pocket price 25% co-insurance a price of 100 means out of pocket is 25.

99
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,020
Price of 200 means out of pocket is 50 and so on. Does that make sense?

100
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:16,780
And so that should help you with your problems. So glad you came back to.

101
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:35,280
Okay. We kind of started on adverse selection last time, so we'll kind of pick up where we left off.

102
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:42,930
Quickly, adverse selection is wide. How would you define it? Health insurance markets.

103
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:52,639
Who's going to buy coverage. So basically, if I can't tell is sure, I can't tell.

104
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:58,970
You know, that you're more expensive than you are. So I have to offer you the same premium is I can't differentiate between the two of you.

105
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:05,420
That's a better deal for you and a worse deal for you. So in all likelihood, you're going to say, Hey, I'm in on that policy.

106
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:08,830
And you might say, You know what? I'm about to take my chances.

107
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:15,049
I get ripped off of that premium. So we would expect that with asymmetric information,

108
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:22,310
insurance markets would have sort of some hard times functioning because if they can't tell the risk level of the people they're insuring,

109
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:25,340
then the people who are going to pose the greatest risk,

110
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:32,570
most likely to file claims are going to find that insurance plan to be a better deal and be more likely to say, take me up on that offer.

111
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:37,550
And then at the end of the year, I'm going to look at my claims experience compared to the premiums I collected.

112
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,130
And I'm not going to be happy so that I'm going to raise my premiums next year.

113
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:50,870
And then maybe even some more of the healthy people who kind of remained in my policy last year are going to drop out and things might get even worse.

114
00:12:54,150 --> 00:13:02,400
So that, as we saw last time in the extreme, could even lead to what's called the adverse selection death spiral, where the plan might just evolve,

115
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:07,139
where you're after it gets sicker and sicker and sicker enrollees higher and higher,

116
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:11,100
higher premiums, and eventually the plan might even disappear from the market.

117
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:19,500
And then we argue that kind of who's hurt by this asymmetric information is actually the low risk people.

118
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:26,570
Obviously healthy individuals are either going to face a tough decision.

119
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:29,750
They have two choices pay too much for insurance.

120
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:36,600
In other words, pay premiums that are across, subsidizing other people's premiums in the plan or take their chances uninsured.

121
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:44,510
So it's actually the low risk individuals who are hard to find. Asymmetric information in insurance markets.

122
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:52,459
They either have to pay more for premiums than their personal risk level would warrant or their despite being risk averse,

123
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:55,580
they might say, well, the premiums are so high and it's going to take my chances.

124
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:06,070
That's true. Business leaders on the issue.

125
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:16,420
Everybody knows. Meaning that, you know, a lot of people whose lives have not been resolved like in your life.

126
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:26,469
What does that mean? Well, that's the great set up we're going to talk about with what can be done to try to mitigate adverse selection.

127
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:33,970
And there are a lot of things that can be done both by insurers as private actions or regulatory actions by policymakers.

128
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:37,720
So I'll hold off on that for a minute. But yes, there's a lot that is done.

129
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:50,069
So kind of as a benchmark. Let's let the insurance market had full information over as insurers can can

130
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:54,300
distinguish the risk characteristics of the different applicants for their policy.

131
00:14:55,140 --> 00:15:02,090
So what we would expect in that case is they would target premiums to that risk level and say you're a high risk person to charge you a high premium,

132
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:07,590
you're a lower risk person. I'm in charge of the lower premium. So that kind of our benchmark, we have full information.

133
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:15,059
We would expect insurance markets to not make subsidies between individuals because essentially,

134
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,760
if you look at the incentive of the low risk individual,

135
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:24,120
because if I say I'm the nice insurer who wants to pool everybody and charge everybody the same rate,

136
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:32,550
some other insurer is going to come along and say, wait a second, I can tell who the good risks really are, so I'm going to offer them a better deal.

137
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:37,950
So now me, the nice insurer who wants to charge everybody the same and rate is going to lose those enrollees.

138
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:49,320
So we would select a an unregulated insurance market with full information to fully reflect risk differences in premiums and premiums,

139
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:55,800
because if they didn't, some competing insurer would offer a great deal to the low risk individuals.

140
00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:02,810
Take them away from that policy that didn't target premiums to risk, and I'd lose money as that.

141
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:11,430
So the nice insurer goes out of business and the low risk individuals and the competing insurer are going to take their business elsewhere.

142
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:23,399
And now let's get back to our world of asymmetric information. So here are the applicants.

143
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:32,500
Nope. I'm sorry. My question is, isn't that the main point of insurance pool risk and this difference?

144
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:36,350
I mean, this is great for people who are at lower risk, who wants to advance,

145
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:40,770
but it just disrupts the whole point of insurance where you quote risk and you.

146
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:45,730
Right. Well, there's a question about what's the point of insurance.

147
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:50,230
So one of the things we talked about was buy health insurance is weird.

148
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:56,620
So remember that one of the one of the reasons we said health insurance is weird is that for most types of insurance,

149
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:02,650
people don't think it ought to be pooling different types of risks and charges on the same premium.

150
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:06,400
We talk about auto insurance, even life insurance.

151
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:13,120
So if you think you and I should pay the same premium for life insurance, probably.

152
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:20,920
Do you think that you should pay the same premium for auto insurance? So let's say you've got a great driving record and you're a very safe driver

153
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:26,200
as somebody with several at fault accidents and a couple of DWI convictions.

154
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,970
Would you argue the point of auto insurance is a good drivers like you can subsidize people with DWI convictions?

155
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,380
Is that the point of auto insurance? No, but I know that this is how it works.

156
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:47,920
I think eventually someone's like the insurance company is going to have to cover someone's car crash from money.

157
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:55,450
And that's. But are they going to charge that person the same premiums that they're going to charge that person a lot more?

158
00:17:56,410 --> 00:18:02,170
So you're you know, so you're going to collect when you have an accident or your car gets stolen,

159
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:06,370
but you're going to collect essentially from the premiums paid by people like you.

160
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:11,799
The DWI person is going to collect when they have an accident or their car stolen,

161
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,920
but they're going to collect from the premiums paid for by people like them.

162
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:20,770
And I think we'll give a specific example from there's the article in the Bureau article,

163
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:28,900
if it's on today's site called ZT versus ex post risk spreading will explain what those concepts are.

164
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:31,120
But I said one of the reasons health insurance is where it is,

165
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:38,019
and people often want those transfers to be made in a way they don't seem to want them to be made for homeowner's insurance,

166
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:47,409
auto insurance, life insurance. And part of the reason is that while health insurance is typically a one year contract and we know one thing that can

167
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:54,010
happen to us is we can get a new diagnosis this year if we have one year contracts and they're always rated to our risk.

168
00:18:55,240 --> 00:19:00,399
What's going to happen over time is that I also face a risk of being reclassified into a much higher premiums,

169
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:08,170
which is a real financial risk that I'd like to insure against. So that's one of the rationales for, I think, the way you feel about it.

170
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:14,140
You know, this is a very reasonable reaction to, well, wait a second, I'm healthy, young and healthy now.

171
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:19,870
But what's going to happen to me in the future? I might actually get a bad diagnosis even this year.

172
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:27,520
And if I'm in this sort of risk rated world, that means what premiums are you be charged for the rest of my life after that,

173
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:34,270
there's a big financial risk associated with that as well. Wouldn't that actually also discourage people from seeking care?

174
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:40,270
Like you wouldn't want a new diagnosis on your record because you would know your health insurance premiums would go up the next year.

175
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:47,380
Because again, one of the things insurers do to try to manage adverse selection is they would try to learn as much as they can about the person.

176
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:52,630
So if you apply for a life insurance policy, there are a number of things that insurers do.

177
00:19:53,200 --> 00:20:01,359
You fill out an application. It's a big checklist of have you ever been diagnosed with blah, blah, blah, you know, and you can check no two things.

178
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:07,340
You can lie, but there's a problem if you lie on the medical record.

179
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:16,629
If they asked if they can practice your medical information in the U.S. using things like your height,

180
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:22,480
weight, everything, that's not something you feel is intended to be an accept that you can be.

181
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:28,660
If people start with the application, but you also sign away their access to your medical records,

182
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:33,790
they will also likely send a nurse to your house to draw blood.

183
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:40,480
And with blood drawing blood, they can check your pre-diabetic, your blood sugar.

184
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:46,600
You have to have HIV. You know, there's all kinds of things they can test for.

185
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:55,809
And then there's another thing that if you lie about having something and they find out within a certain number of years, they can cancel the policy,

186
00:20:55,810 --> 00:21:02,590
or if you die before that time period of time, they can deny paying the claim if they can verify that you lied on your policy.

187
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:09,130
Also, if they say, you know, I, you know, I checked no for HIV and suppose they didn't come out and test me for it.

188
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:16,320
And then six months later, I die of AIDS. You know, they can then go back to my records and say, well, wait a day.

189
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:19,540
That really was that a new diagnosis in the last six months?

190
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:27,280
Probably not, because AIDS very seldom hills these days within that short of a timeframe, people live a long time with it.

191
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:35,799
If I died six months after buying the policy, I probably knew I was HIV positive and was having a bunch of symptoms and my care

192
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:40,390
was not being I condition was not being managed effectively and I'm going downhill.

193
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:44,840
And that's why I bought the life. Insurance policy. So they can then deny paying claims.

194
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:49,220
So there's a lot they can do to try to level the information.

195
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:53,150
So that's one of the things we'll talk about through leveling the playing field information.

196
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:03,970
So it's actually. Talk about sort of getting who's really hurt.

197
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:10,100
It's going to be the low risk individuals because either, you know, the low risk drop out of the out of insurance,

198
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:15,469
then eventually premiums for the high risks are going to reflect the high risk they think that they pose

199
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:19,700
on the insured because they're the only people in the policies of the insurers going to stay in business.

200
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,470
They're going to have to charge them high premiums.

201
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:27,349
So the high risks are really worse off than they would be under full information or full information.

202
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:34,100
They would charge high premiums. But if all the low risks drop out and very symmetric information, the high risks are still going to be charge.

203
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:39,950
High premiums is they're going to be the only ones in the policy. The insurer is going to have to collect enough premiums to pay those claims.

204
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,950
It is the lowest sort of by the policy nonetheless.

205
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:45,760
You know,

206
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:51,310
then the higher ups are definitely better off than they would have been under full information because they're getting this premium cross-subsidy.

207
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:58,030
But the low risks are worse off because they're paying a much higher premium than they would have under full information.

208
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:09,520
I went through this example that if they're sure I can tell them apart,

209
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:14,260
there's going to be basically two policies that would be policy for high risk people, a policy for low risk people.

210
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,920
And premiums are going to be targeted to that risk level.

211
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:22,120
And there's not going to be sort of a cross-subsidy from the low risks to the IRS.

212
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:28,180
No know to this kind of previous slide to sort of explain the graph.

213
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:34,520
Now, suppose we have two individuals that got the same utility of income curve.

214
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:37,540
They both have $25,000 as their initial income.

215
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:42,820
So we kind of put them on the same graph. They got the same preferences towards risk, they've got the same initial income.

216
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:53,200
They both face a risk of losing $20,000, but one of them only has a 25% chance of that bad thing occurring.

217
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:56,740
The other one has a 75% chance of that bad thing occurring.

218
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:05,299
Now suppose the insurer can't tell them apart. And suppose you got a really nice insurer that's not charging any loading.

219
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:10,670
They're just going to try to charge the if they're going to try to charge enough money to pay the claims that come in.

220
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:15,470
So these two people are equally likely in the population.

221
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:18,410
So half the population is the high risk, the 75%.

222
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:26,240
Half is the low risk, the 25%, one premium, what the insurer have to charge to pay claims, assuming that everybody is going to buy the policy.

223
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:35,740
In ten, 10,000 seats, the average loss is 10,000.

224
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:51,880
So we've got. Each of these would also be weighted by half because they're half the population.

225
00:24:56,650 --> 00:25:01,780
So these these people on average lose 5000. These people on average lose 15,000.

226
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:08,740
So in the population level, 10,000 is the average risk.

227
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:23,040
Okay. So what would that leave these individuals with? If they bought the policy, they'd have $15,000 for sure and they'd have utility level you star.

228
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:28,489
So if they buy this full insurance policy, that means that just locks in a particular level of income.

229
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:33,230
They no longer face risk. They're no longer gambling between two different points on their utility of income curve.

230
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:38,060
They've guaranteed themselves an income of 15 and the utility of the star.

231
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:45,290
So that's the situation. If they buy the policy now, is the high risk person going to buy the policy?

232
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:50,640
Oh, yeah, he is. Where would they be uninsured?

233
00:25:52,060 --> 00:26:00,960
Or those people are gambling between these two points to the uninsured.

234
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:05,010
If they are lucky and don't have the loss, they keep their whole $25,000.

235
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:14,730
If they're unlucky and they have the loss, their income drops to 5000 and their utility drops down to this level.

236
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:21,660
So for the high risk person, where are they going to be on average if they take their chances on insured?

237
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:31,410
Which DOT represents the high risk person and.

238
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:37,140
Yeah. So on average, the high risk person is going to lose $15,000.

239
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:44,879
They've got a 75% chance of losing 20,000. So on average, they lose 15, which means they would drop from 25 to 10.

240
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,450
And on average, ten is going to be their average income uninsured.

241
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:55,130
Their expected utility uninsured is going to be the subscript h.

242
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:57,150
That's the high risk versus expected utility.

243
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:03,720
So remember, we are gambling between these two points, but essentially they've got a 75% chance of being at this point.

244
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:08,100
So on average, they're going to be three quarters of the way down towards the bad outcome.

245
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:14,100
Okay. So what's better being in short or being uninsured for the high risk person?

246
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:20,550
Yeah, definitely being insured because this is way better than that.

247
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:27,230
Now, let's look at it from the perspective of the low risk person. And they're gambling between the same points.

248
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:31,580
If they have no loss, they keep their old 25,000 and that would be their utility.

249
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:38,330
If they do have the loss, they lose 20,000, they drop down to 5000 and they drop down to this level of utility.

250
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:40,460
But where are they going to be on average?

251
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:49,250
On average, every way up here, because they're three quarters of the way on the score towards the good outcome.

252
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:52,549
Where where we are on the court just depends on the probability of the loss.

253
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:56,660
The greater the probability of the loss, the farther you're down towards this point,

254
00:27:57,050 --> 00:28:00,470
the smaller the probability of the loss, the greater you are towards the good outcomes.

255
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:05,240
You're putting most of the probability weight on a good outcome being here with no loss.

256
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:11,690
So on average they lose $5,000, right? 25% chance of losing 20,000.

257
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:16,460
So their average or expected income, if they take their chances, is 20,000.

258
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,610
And this is their average or expected utility.

259
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:26,870
And they say, wait a second, my expected utility, uninsured is higher, that my utility insured, I'm out.

260
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:34,760
That makes sense. High risk person says, You know what, I'm up.

261
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:38,510
I'd love to buy a policy for $5,000.

262
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:44,260
A premium that reflects. My level of risk.

263
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:52,810
If I could lock in 20,000 for sure, I'd be at that point, and I'd be better off doing that than being uninsured.

264
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:59,270
Which leads me here. But nobody's selling you the policy for 5000 because of asymmetric information.

265
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:03,940
They can't tell that I'm the low risk person. They're trying to charge me $10,000.

266
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:09,719
They charged me $10,000. I'm way down here.

267
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:16,560
And I say, wait a second. My expected utility, uninsured is greater than you star, which is my utility.

268
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:20,850
You're paying $10,000 for insurance. I'm going to stay uninsured.

269
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:28,140
The lowest person says the exact opposite. Their expected utility or the high risk person, their expected utility.

270
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:39,180
The uninsured is a lot less than their utility insured.

271
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:46,469
They say, I'd love to pay $10,000 because wait a sec, my average loss is 15,000.

272
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:50,850
That's actually better than my actuarially fair premium. You know, I'm in on this deal.

273
00:29:54,980 --> 00:30:01,940
That's kind of graphically how we see the kind of adverse selection problem potentially play out or risk individual says,

274
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:04,489
you know what, I'm risk averse. I'd like to have insurance.

275
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:12,020
I'd be happy to pay my own personal RFP, but I'm actually not willing to pay the average population average HFP,

276
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:17,990
which forces me to pay $5,000 towards subsidizing a premium as a high risk person.

277
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:28,340
Any questions on that before we move on? Okay.

278
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:33,049
So then let's get I think we're moving towards your question. What is the evidence for adverse selection?

279
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:38,780
Don't market don't markets or regulations take care of it? And then what might they do to take care of it?

280
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:41,809
So if there is adverse selection in insurance markets,

281
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:46,370
we have sort of three basic empirical protections or three things we'd expect to see in the world.

282
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:53,690
If adverse selection is a problem, we'd expect to see a positive correlation between risk level and coverage.

283
00:30:54,080 --> 00:31:00,110
In other words, lower risk people are going to have less coverage and be less likely to be uninsured, to be insured at all.

284
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:03,530
And if they get insurance, they're going to choose plans that have, say,

285
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:09,950
more cost sharing or more restrictions in terms of managed care, limiting where they can go or how much care they can get.

286
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:14,000
And higher risk people are going to say, well, we're more likely to get coverage.

287
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,410
And when we do get coverage, we're going to want more generous, less restrictive coverage.

288
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:23,840
So that's one prediction that we would have. Second is what we call ballpark ups.

289
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:30,890
And if you remember that exercise we did with the data from the Michigan Health Exchange for the bronze,

290
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:37,969
silver and gold plans, we saw a scaling up of premiums and said, well, if, you know, just keep the example simple.

291
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:41,150
If, say, it costs $100 a month, you get 50% coverage.

292
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:46,850
If there's no adverse selection or moral hazard, it should cost $200 a month to get 100% coverage.

293
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:54,800
If it ends up costing more than $200 to double my coverage from 50% to 100%, as we call the ballpark up,

294
00:31:55,220 --> 00:32:00,379
that means the insurer is anticipating that the more generous plan is either you have more moral hazard,

295
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:07,700
people are going to use more care because of a lower out-of-pocket price and higher risk people,

296
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:14,090
more expensive people are more likely to say, hey, that premium is worth it to me to get 100% coverage rather than 50.

297
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,920
So we can't sort of distinguish is it from that? Is an adverse selection or moral hazard?

298
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:28,220
In all likelihood, it's both operating at the same time. And if you've got greater coverage, is lower out-of-pocket price, more moral hazard.

299
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:34,680
But there's also going to be more attractiveness of that. Greater coverage to high risk people.

300
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:42,000
And the third is we see examples of adverse selection death spirals occur where certain plans kind of disappear from the market,

301
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,980
the very generous plans that are most likely to be attractive for high risk people.

302
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:51,210
Okay, so positive correlation between risk and coverage.

303
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:58,530
So probably an old literature review, but it's sort of a still pretty comprehensive role was there at the time?

304
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:02,430
There were four studies that looked at the decision to be assured versus not,

305
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:07,800
and three of the four found statistically significant evidence of adverse selection into coverage.

306
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,090
The fourth didn't find either result. It didn't find a contradictory result.

307
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:18,400
It just didn't find. Any significant relation either direction.

308
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:23,530
We also can look at things like choice of fee for service insurance versus managed care.

309
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:28,180
We would think that the various restrictions managed care places like saying

310
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:33,850
what providers I can go to or making me get pre-approval for certain services

311
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:41,830
from my primary care physician and jump through more hoops to get things approved would be a bigger deal to people who are expected to use more care.

312
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:46,270
It'd be less of a big deal to people who don't expecting as much care.

313
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,620
So somebody is not expecting this. As much care might say, Hey, managed care has got lower premiums.

314
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:57,820
I'm willing to put up with a restrictive provider network and having to jump through hoops to get that get things approved.

315
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:07,540
And two thirds of the studies of that, that choice between do I enroll on or unrestricted fee for service type plan or a managed care plan.

316
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:13,660
But two thirds of those studies found that there was significant adverse selection into the fee for service plans.

317
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:17,919
And again, the ones that didn't ward up didn't necessarily find contradictory evidence.

318
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:21,700
Some of them just said found no no effect one way or the other.

319
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:28,470
Pretty unequivocal in the choice between more or less generous plans.

320
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,399
So 14 studies looked at people that were in choice environments like, say,

321
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:37,380
an employer offered a more generous plan at a higher premium or less generous plan at a lower premium.

322
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:42,420
And whereas that sort of just pure choice of a similar plan, but how generous it is,

323
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:49,170
we had 14 out of 14 studies found significant evidence that sicker people chose the more generous plans.

324
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,690
And then we also can look at switching plans over time,

325
00:34:54,710 --> 00:35:01,190
and we see that people who become high spenders are more likely to leave managed care and go back to fee for service.

326
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:06,710
People who are low spenders over time are more likely to leave fee for service and go into managed care plans.

327
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,610
So as people switch, maybe as their health status changes over time,

328
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:19,880
we see the exact type of movement between fee for service and managed care that we expect as people are sort of selecting plans by risk.

329
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:28,500
So that sort of first piece of evidence seems pretty good. We had the bulk markups, so I just didn't put the numbers in here.

330
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:32,460
But the same numbers that we saw on a previous slide, we're talking about moral hazard that.

331
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:38,200
The silver plans were more expensive than LeBron's plans, not just because they covered more,

332
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:42,460
but they were more expensive in terms of premiums per percent covered.

333
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:48,160
So it's kind of like that hypothetical 100% plan.

334
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:52,270
It's going to be more than $200 for the 50% plan, $100.

335
00:35:53,260 --> 00:36:01,030
And the gold plan was even more. And then what we can also say is that also another tier called platinum to 90% coverage.

336
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:08,139
So bronze plans on average cover 60%. So the way they get to that is usually a high deductible because you want pretty

337
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:11,800
generous coverage of something really catastrophic and expensive occurs to you.

338
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:16,600
So if the plan is only covering 60% of all expenses in their population,

339
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:22,329
the way it covers catastrophic things is that because of high deductible silver plans,

340
00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:27,580
over 70% there of a little lower deductible, maybe a little less coinsurance.

341
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:39,280
Gold plans cover 80. And there's no point on a here for platinum plans, but they cover 95 because very few platinum plans are even offered.

342
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:45,500
So it's kind of evidence of maybe a death spiral has occurred.

343
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:50,450
Originally, there were some platinum plans and most insurers quickly dropped them and said,

344
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:53,990
you know, in the exchanges, the gold is as high as we're going to go on coverage.

345
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:59,030
They found the few people who enrolled in platinum plans tended to be very high users.

346
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:07,060
And then there's some evidence from particular plans or a Harvard employee plan that was studied a number of years ago.

347
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:14,290
And they kind of follow them over through over a three year period in 1987, ended up dropping the plan.

348
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:22,080
So they had the most the the PPO was the plan that enrolled kind of the older and sicker individuals.

349
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:28,180
The HMO typically enrolled the younger and healthier individuals. They raised the premiums to the people to reflect that.

350
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:35,620
And you can see in 1994, compared to 1993, the Greens are the ones that left the switch from PPO to the HMO.

351
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:41,680
That was the ones that stayed subversive. Later of this, many of the people the year before shrunk to this many.

352
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:50,460
Following year that many more left. So people shrunk to here and then the next year they actually killed the people.

353
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:52,850
1987, they didn't even offer it anymore.

354
00:37:53,280 --> 00:38:01,360
Then you can see the date on there and some of that like average age and spending rates and things of this problem, the leavers versus stayers.

355
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:04,920
And it was that sort of dynamic of each year as the premiums went up.

356
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:11,640
The people who are still relatively healthy for PPO enrollees, they left next year.

357
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:17,550
The premiums were up further. The healthiest of those who had didn't leave last year, they left this year.

358
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:23,310
And eventually the PPO became so small that Harvard decides not even worth offering anymore.

359
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:31,380
So in this case, if you're completely eliminating crypto, aren't you just kind of.

360
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:37,569
Kind of transferring that risk from the insurers to the sicker people,

361
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:41,860
because if they're sick, they're going to utilize health care no matter what, if they need it.

362
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:46,930
So now they just be paying higher deductibles and know you're kind of forcing them into the HMO.

363
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:54,580
So what happened is that they basically said, okay, just move everybody into the HMO, that point.

364
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:59,990
Rather having this very small plan just for a very few people.

365
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:12,349
Okay so solutions to try to level the information playing field the words insurers can try

366
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:16,190
to learn some of the things they don't know immediately when somebody applies for coverage.

367
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:24,700
There certainly is going to be a variation in risk just within this room of young, primarily healthy people.

368
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:28,450
I have no idea if I'm the insurer sitting. I'm looking at you.

369
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:33,309
You you all look the same to me in terms of health care risk. I can not tell the difference.

370
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:40,870
I can not predict which one of you has an adverse family history already has some chronic condition that's been diagnosed.

371
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:44,620
I have absolutely no idea. Looking at you, you're all the same to me, this insurer.

372
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:50,110
So I can try to learn that information to drive the life insurance example of how they would try to learn that information.

373
00:39:51,880 --> 00:40:01,570
Or you could try to get people to self-select. So I might offer the restricted plan like the HMO and say, well, who's going to enroll in that?

374
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:06,459
It's going to be healthier people. He's a higher risk.

375
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:09,850
People may not want to be limited to my very narrow provider network.

376
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:13,540
They might not want to have to jump through all kinds of hoops to get their care approved.

377
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:21,350
So short selling insurance to individuals maybe will sell insurance to large groups that were

378
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:26,600
formed for reasons primarily other than vehicle being vehicles to purchase health insurance.

379
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:36,660
Policy wise, we could mandate coverage as the ACA tried to, or we could subsidize insurance for purchase as the ACA does.

380
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:49,700
Or we can do risk adjustment and try to. ACA also has mechanisms to transfer premiums from plans and exchanges that have a bad

381
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:53,550
set of enrollees in terms of their claims history versus the better set of results.

382
00:40:55,950 --> 00:41:02,759
So leveling the information playing field, insurers can try to collect data, health history, lab tests, fitness trackers.

383
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,100
I think in one of the student presentations on life insurance,

384
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:09,780
you talk about assurance companies, say your fitness tracker and they had access to that data.

385
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:15,960
And if you gave them access to that data and you had a certain number of steps a day or whatever, they gave you a lower rate.

386
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:17,550
Now,

387
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:29,670
that might have been because that encourages you to be healthier and actually reduces your risk of dying and filing an early claim for life insurance.

388
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:34,470
Or it might really just been a self-selection device. Who's going to say, Yeah, sure.

389
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:44,340
Oh, we're a fitness tracker, and you can have the data, probably a lower risk person to start with because I sent me you get you in that plan.

390
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:50,670
But as long as you know, I'm not in the plan. But if that plan were it available to you.

391
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:50,909
Yeah.

392
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:57,180
I mean, if you if for a long run motivation to go to the gym rather than buying a real expensive gym membership, buy a policy that lowers your rate.

393
00:41:57,330 --> 00:42:00,540
Yeah, you know, an auto insurance.

394
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:10,439
Now, you can get, you know, since all of our cars or their recent models you have all the data is kind of goes right up to the or to the manufacturer.

395
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:20,040
So I get a report every month from my car say you know you're driving score this month was an 83 and

396
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:27,870
because of that you might qualify for better auto insurance rates until you get that road rage.

397
00:42:28,290 --> 00:42:33,449
Yeah, I'm telling you, right on I-94 for tests left,

398
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:40,190
you go through with a lot problems leveling the information playing field is it doesn't protect against that risk we talking

399
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:49,360
about being reclassified that I'd also ideally like to have coverage that says you know what if you get a new diagnosis,

400
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:53,940
if you're diagnosed with cancer this year, we're not going to raise your premiums to $80,000 next year.

401
00:42:59,230 --> 00:43:05,559
Self-Selection. So if we offer a plan with high cost sharing or a very restrictive managed care

402
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:11,680
provisions we will most likely to enroll in at the lower users or higher users.

403
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:19,780
So $5,000 deductible, probably the higher user is going to say, well, wait a second, I don't want a $5,000 deductible.

404
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:29,000
Selling insurance through large groups. So this is my open enrollment week for the University of Michigan.

405
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:38,510
So I've got to pick my plan for next year is insurance is pretty predictable for this big group.

406
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:43,580
We weren't prime employees independence of University of Michigan employees that get our insurance here.

407
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:49,190
We're formed. That group was formed for a reason other than just to get a great deal on health insurance.

408
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:55,860
So we've got some predictable risk characteristics for the insurers or in this case, the university itself,

409
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:57,600
because it's large enough to be self-insured,

410
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:04,050
just hires the insurance companies to do things like pay claims and set up networks and negotiate prices.

411
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:11,190
It's really the university that's bearing that risk. They understand of roughly what this whole population looks like.

412
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:16,650
They have data from last year. They know the data from last year look very similar to the data from the year before.

413
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,410
Most of us stay in this group from year to year.

414
00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:26,350
A few of us will retire every year or be a few new hires every year, but that's a very stable population.

415
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:34,150
This year's retirees kind of look like last year's retirees this year as new hires kind of look like last year's new hires.

416
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:43,800
So we've got a group that came together. For a reason other than buying insurance, and it creates sort of a stable long term group.

417
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:47,490
It also gives me some of that protection against reclassification.

418
00:44:48,330 --> 00:44:52,710
As long as I'm able to stay to the University of Michigan employee group.

419
00:44:54,770 --> 00:44:59,060
If I am diagnosed with something new this year, they don't raise my premiums next year.

420
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:06,240
So that risk of being reclassified is somewhat mitigated by my ability to stay in this group.

421
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:11,700
Now, if I have something happen to me that's so bad that I can't stay in this group anymore, I have to quit my job.

422
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:18,870
And after a while, I can no longer even buy Cobra where I can by paying full premiums to stay in the plans solely for a certain amount of time.

423
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:24,959
Then I lose that protection against being reclassified. As long as I'm able to stay.

424
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,200
If I'm diagnosed with something this year, I premiums next year are not good.

425
00:45:30,570 --> 00:45:33,630
Now, does it work for everybody? Because I've got to participate in the labor force.

426
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:40,200
It might limit my job mobility. I might not want to leave here because I'm kind of locked into this insurance plan.

427
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:53,550
And we use policy to mandate or subsidize. So ACA original approach is, well, we're not going to allow any rating based on preexisting conditions.

428
00:45:54,810 --> 00:46:01,320
There is limited age rating. They can charge older, older enrollees in the exchanges more than younger enrollees.

429
00:46:02,310 --> 00:46:06,480
But that age rating is not as big as the gap in spending by age.

430
00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:14,010
So a 64 year old compared to, say, a 21 year old is about a 5 to 1 spending difference on average.

431
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:18,870
And I think the limit on the age rating difference is something like two and a half or three times.

432
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:25,620
So you can only charge that your most expensive age group two and a half or three times what you charge the least expensive age group.

433
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:28,950
Whereas the true risk difference is about five fold.

434
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:36,270
So there is age rating allowed, but that age rating is limited to be less than the actual difference in spending.

435
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:40,920
Its mandate was eliminated by the Supreme Court.

436
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:46,470
So actually is limited by Congress, I should say.

437
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:51,000
That was Supreme Court, Congress or all of the ACA all the time.

438
00:46:51,000 --> 00:47:00,060
So that the mandate was actually ruled unconstitutional in the original Supreme Court case against the ACA because it was going to be a tax.

439
00:47:00,810 --> 00:47:04,170
But then when the Republicans took over Congress, they zeroed out the tax.

440
00:47:04,710 --> 00:47:11,710
They didn't eliminate the mandate. Eliminating the mandate would have required 60 votes in the Senate because there wasn't a budget.

441
00:47:11,710 --> 00:47:19,210
That's not a budgetary issues that couldn't be done under reconciliation rules, which allow 5051 votes in the Senate to pass something.

442
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:24,680
But setting taking the mandate penalty and reducing it to zero is a budgetary decision,

443
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:30,399
and therefore it falls under the parliamentary rules of reconciliation in the Senate.

444
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:35,140
So they could do that with 51 votes. So the mandate actually still exists.

445
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:37,780
There's just no penalty for violating.

446
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:45,860
So it's kind of like a tree falls in the forest thing if there's a mandate, but there's no penalty for violating it.

447
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:49,070
Is there a mandate? Exactly.

448
00:47:49,490 --> 00:47:55,399
It's a meaningless mandate. So you couldn't actually eliminate the mandate, but they could zero out the penalty for it,

449
00:47:55,400 --> 00:48:03,110
which is the same thing as eliminating mandate practically. And then there are big subsidies to encourage people to participate.

450
00:48:05,290 --> 00:48:07,179
Now, the subsidies, of course, are income limited.

451
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:13,390
They phase out by 400% of the federal poverty line, but at least four people are getting the subsidies.

452
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:18,040
That's one inducement. And that turn out to be probably more important than the mandates,

453
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:24,010
because when the mandate was eliminated, people didn't suddenly quit the exchanges in droves.

454
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:27,220
I mean, how so? If it's income limited,

455
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:34,660
then there's an assumption that there's enough low risk people with low income that the subsidies would be effective to increasing coverage.

456
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:42,210
Is this is this just a strategy to actually get people insured and not do crowd out or

457
00:48:42,310 --> 00:48:49,630
it seems like these subsidies would not be that effective based on the demographics?

458
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:53,720
So the subsidies were not fully effective.

459
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:59,660
We have a lot of people who still don't have coverage, but the uninsurance rate went down by about a third roughly.

460
00:49:00,950 --> 00:49:08,150
If you look at where it is today relative to where it was before the ACA came out by a third or a little more than a third.

461
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:14,330
So you still have a lot of people at risk who have not bought into the plan with the subsidies of the scheme.

462
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:20,960
If you look at the premiums that have developed over time for the exchanges, they've definitely stabilized.

463
00:49:21,890 --> 00:49:24,980
Now that your changes are very small, first few years.

464
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:31,049
Premiums went up quite a bit because the insurers overestimated the exactly the point you're making.

465
00:49:31,050 --> 00:49:39,330
And the insurers initially overestimated how many healthy people would say, hey, I'm going to buy this exchange plan in the first year or two.

466
00:49:39,350 --> 00:49:44,510
Premiums went up quite a bit and as the experience was worse and insurers expected.

467
00:49:44,910 --> 00:49:51,550
But that sort of stabilized after the first few quarters. So it's incomplete, but it's definitely some.

468
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:59,690
Okay. So I'm going to use kind of an example to illustrate this.

469
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:07,770
And this is the idea of are you subsidizing people's premiums or are you simply paying for their claims?

470
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:15,909
What does insurance do? So if we have what's called community rating, where if everybody is charged the same, what that does,

471
00:50:15,910 --> 00:50:21,580
if there is different types of risk in that population, there are predictable gains and losses across people.

472
00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:30,730
Low risk people are predictably going to pay a higher premium that is going to cross-subsidize high risk people

473
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:35,890
who can then pay a lower premium than they would in a world where premiums were set to the individual risk.

474
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:42,670
And that's what we call ex-ante transfer. As I say, it's just kind of a fancy phrase for before the fact before.

475
00:50:42,670 --> 00:50:46,810
And the fact here is when we find out who actually gets sick this year and file a claim,

476
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:52,030
we just know some people are on average, this group is going to use more than than this group.

477
00:50:52,510 --> 00:51:00,430
And if we charge them all the same, what we're doing is we're essentially subsidizing the high risk groups premiums by charging the low risk group,

478
00:51:00,730 --> 00:51:04,420
quote, too much, too much from a perspective of their own personal risk level.

479
00:51:05,770 --> 00:51:12,280
So we're transferring money across these populations, predictably at the beginning of the year, just through premiums.

480
00:51:12,910 --> 00:51:16,300
And then there's the ex-post transfers that insurance creates.

481
00:51:16,510 --> 00:51:20,290
And that's just simply the claims that are paid once we find out who actually has the loss.

482
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:29,390
There's an example in the. The short barrel paper is.

483
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:39,300
Three things that I think kind of makes it pretty clear. So those are your property insurance.

484
00:51:39,870 --> 00:51:43,530
And we've got two types of houses. We've got houses on the coast.

485
00:51:44,010 --> 00:51:52,610
We've got houses that are inland. There is a chance of hurricane damage if your house is damaged by a hurricane.

486
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:59,550
Let's say there's a $50,000 loss. If your house is on the coast.

487
00:52:05,410 --> 00:52:11,590
There's a 10% chance that your house suffers hurricane damage if your house is inland.

488
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:19,660
There's a 1% chance these Americans weaken by the time we get in one.

489
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:34,280
And let's assume that insurance companies charge loading of 10% as they charge premiums that are 10% above the actuarially fair premium.

490
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:43,800
So can an insurance company tell which houses are on the coast through which houses are incredibly easy to observe?

491
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:47,100
So what do we expect insurance companies to do?

492
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:57,060
So if they're doing, say, a 10% loading, they're going to say, well, if I house is on a coast, there's a 10% chance of losing $50,000.

493
00:52:57,060 --> 00:53:02,970
So the average loss I'm facing from insuring a house like this is $5,000.

494
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:07,830
So I'm going to charge them a premium of 5500.

495
00:53:10,170 --> 00:53:14,840
I'll go look at the inland houses and I say, Here's a 1% chance of a $50,000 loss.

496
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:21,320
Expected value is $500. So I'm going to charge these folks $550.

497
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:29,270
So there is my full information insurance equilibrium. So we've got, say, competition in the insurance market drives loading to 10%.

498
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:33,620
There's enough insurers competing for business that get a pretty good deal.

499
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:40,760
You're not paying that much above your RFP. And insurers are going to say, hey, I can identify these houses and their risk level.

500
00:53:40,770 --> 00:53:44,150
I can clearly tell that relative to these, I just look on a map.

501
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:52,740
Map the address so I can tell what grade I should charge them or charge these guys 550 and recharge these guys 5500.

502
00:53:54,830 --> 00:53:58,490
Okay. Then what's going to happen? Either they're going have a loss or not.

503
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:00,830
So let's say you're a coastal house.

504
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:13,730
If you have a loss, you're going to collect $50,000, meaning on net you're up 44,500 from having bought insurance.

505
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:20,479
That premium, 5500 is gone. You have the loss, you're netting 44,500.

506
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:25,130
They're paying your $50,000 claim, but you paid 50 $500 for that privilege.

507
00:54:26,090 --> 00:54:36,050
On the other hand, if you're in the 90% that don't have a loss, your net this year from your decision to purchase insurance is -5500.

508
00:54:37,310 --> 00:54:41,570
So essentially you've got 90% of the people in this bucket, 10% of the people in this bucket.

509
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:48,170
But it's the money in this box that allows the insurer to pay for the people in that blockage.

510
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:58,530
That's what we call the exposed transfer from insurance. Once we figure out which 10% of the houses actually had damage and which 90% didn't,

511
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:08,370
we use the premiums paid by everybody and importantly, paid by the 90% that didn't collect to pay the claims of the 10% the debt.

512
00:55:09,210 --> 00:55:14,850
So that's what we call ex post risk spreading once we figure out who actually had the loss and filed the claim.

513
00:55:15,210 --> 00:55:21,690
Then money moves. Money moves from this pot of money that everybody put in or the graphic of every putting money into the jar.

514
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:27,160
The beginning of the year, all these homeowners put money into the jar at the end of the year.

515
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:35,190
Once it was discovered, which 10% of them had the loss. That money was taken out of the jar and given to that 10%.

516
00:55:36,090 --> 00:55:43,230
But the insurance company keeping a loading sheet and if there's no hurricane, then they just keep it off.

517
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:47,519
Yeah, because no hurricanes assume they are. They're insuring people in different areas of the country.

518
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:51,870
So it's not like in one neighborhood. So let's pretend these are independent risks.

519
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:59,970
So that's the way the insurance market would work. It would not sub some cross subsidized premiums.

520
00:56:01,490 --> 00:56:06,300
You know, these people are paying essentially 91% of the premiums.

521
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:13,380
Got to do the math. If they're saying half the people are in inland homes and half or on the coast.

522
00:56:13,710 --> 00:56:21,980
If you do the math on the premiums, the coastal people pay 91% of the total plate premiums and they make 91% of the total claims.

523
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:27,520
So there's literally no cross-subsidy of anybody's premiums.

524
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:34,300
There's no ex-ante transfer made. There's no transfer before we know who has the actual bad event occur.

525
00:56:35,770 --> 00:56:45,700
Now, let's suppose that instead. The state had a regulation and say all the politically powerful people in the state have nice houses on the coast.

526
00:56:46,690 --> 00:56:50,290
All the politically not powerful people in the state, well, they're stuck living inland.

527
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:56,950
What are the politically powerful people going to do when they lobby the state legislature?

528
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:06,639
You know, it is so unfair that, look, our our our ports are ten times as much as these.

529
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:12,360
And look, that is so unfair. So what are we going to do?

530
00:57:12,370 --> 00:57:15,490
We're the politically powerful people with the beautiful houses on the coast.

531
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:22,600
We're going to say we mandate community rating. In other words, all homeowners insurance has to be priced the same.

532
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:34,799
Okay, so what would the premiums then be? So we said half our poems are in each situation.

533
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:42,310
So we just average hit 5500 plus five, 50 divided by 30.

534
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:47,160
Everybody's going to pay 30000 to $25.

535
00:57:48,870 --> 00:57:55,280
So now now we have X ante transfers being made because let's look at the house.

536
00:57:55,290 --> 00:57:59,160
3000 503,025 works. Well, half the people.

537
00:58:01,850 --> 00:58:08,120
Would have paid only 550 if they could have gotten a premium based on their actual level of risk.

538
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:18,920
So what are they doing? They're sending SWAT teams 2470 $5 to subsidize the premiums of these coastal people.

539
00:58:20,090 --> 00:58:27,110
The coastal people would have had to pay 550 and five, five, 5500.

540
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:31,910
But they're essentially getting this 2475.

541
00:58:34,990 --> 00:58:42,370
So when we have these people fooled at the same rate, we have both types of transfers being made at the beginning of the year,

542
00:58:42,370 --> 00:58:45,850
just in premiums before we know who actually is going to have damage this year.

543
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:53,050
The coastal people are already winners in this transfer day and the inland people are losers.

544
00:58:54,100 --> 00:59:00,520
And then once the year progresses, then we'll know who actually had the damage and then the people who had the damage,

545
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:08,290
regardless of whether they were inland or coastal, they collect. So in this case, now the losers collect $50,000.

546
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:12,880
The people who have have the hurricane damage.

547
00:59:13,450 --> 00:59:16,990
So they're going to net 50,000, -3000, 25.

548
00:59:17,770 --> 00:59:22,809
So the ones that have the. And that's regardless of whether they were inland or coastal, they paid the same premiums.

549
00:59:22,810 --> 00:59:30,940
They had the same damage. It's just the coastal people are ten times more likely to collect that $47,000 net gain.

550
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:43,500
So now we've got we still have the coastal people filing 91% of the claims, but they're only paying 50% of the premiums.

551
00:59:46,790 --> 00:59:50,689
So in this scenario, after the coastal people go to the legislature and say,

552
00:59:50,690 --> 00:59:59,300
it's so unfair that we pay ten times as much for homeowner's insurance and the legislature passes this law, we now have ex ante transfers.

553
00:59:59,870 --> 01:00:04,100
We've got the coastal peoples. Premiums are being subsidized by the inland people.

554
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:09,560
There's that predictable game every year before we even know who we are, who has hurricane damage.

555
01:00:10,010 --> 01:00:13,160
These people are paying 25, $475.

556
01:00:14,170 --> 01:00:17,890
Too much. And these people are spinning 25, 24 so far too little.

557
01:00:18,130 --> 01:00:21,220
And I would say not too much or too little in a moral sense with too much or too little,

558
01:00:21,220 --> 01:00:29,920
just an actuarial sense in terms of what they would have paid if they would have paid a premium based on their actual risk of filing a claim.

559
01:00:30,910 --> 01:00:33,510
So it's like too much or too little here.

560
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:38,710
I'm not trying to make any moral judgment here about what the right premium is for different types of people.

561
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:44,590
Just saying relative to the risk of claims that they actually create for the insurer.

562
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:52,520
That was an example. Hopefully make this a little more clear.

563
01:00:53,330 --> 01:00:59,600
So if we have an unregulated full information insurance market, there would be no ex-ante transfers.

564
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:06,410
That market will look just like this. Coastal, 91% of claims, but they pay 91% of premiums.

565
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:11,510
In millions, 9% of all claims, they pay 9% of all premiums.

566
01:01:20,470 --> 01:01:24,430
So I shift gears a little bit into sort of product differentiation for insurance.

567
01:01:24,850 --> 01:01:28,030
So we've talked a little bit about sort of fee for service and managed care.

568
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:33,219
Kind of just dig into that a little bit deeper and we think sort of the what really

569
01:01:33,220 --> 01:01:37,480
the fundamental economic differences between those two approaches to insurance.

570
01:01:37,990 --> 01:01:42,370
And again, there's a lot of different flavors of it, but it's kind of putting them in sort of two buckets.

571
01:01:42,790 --> 01:01:50,770
So conventional fee for service insurance is one that doesn't really restrict networks or choice and doesn't really manage the care process.

572
01:01:51,220 --> 01:01:59,140
In other words, you can choose any doctor or hospital you want and they will cover any care that you and that provider agree that you will get.

573
01:02:01,030 --> 01:02:05,700
So you're unrestricted in your choice of provider and you're basically unrestricted in the carrier.

574
01:02:05,950 --> 01:02:09,520
That's sort of the pure conventional fee for service insurance.

575
01:02:09,550 --> 01:02:15,100
All they do is pay claims. The insurers only function in that world is to pay claims.

576
01:02:15,610 --> 01:02:19,960
They collect premiums at the beginning of the year and then they pay claims throughout the year.

577
01:02:20,710 --> 01:02:27,820
That's literally all they do. Managed care creates a flip of this.

578
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:35,080
So if you think about conventional fee for service at the point of care, once I'm sick and I'm seeking care, I'm completely unconstrained.

579
01:02:36,340 --> 01:02:41,410
I go, whatever doctor I want, whatever hospital I want and get, whatever care that provider I agree to.

580
01:02:42,670 --> 01:02:46,840
But in exchange for that privilege of being completely unconstrained at the point of care,

581
01:02:47,230 --> 01:02:54,910
I'm going to have to pay a higher premium at the beginning of the year. Because that lack of constraint is going to lead to higher spending.

582
01:02:56,180 --> 01:03:02,170
So I pay at the beginning of the year in order to not be constrained during the year.

583
01:03:02,740 --> 01:03:06,310
Managed care kind of flips that I get a lower premium at the beginning of the year.

584
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:13,660
But the reason I get that lower premium is that at the point of care, I face some constraints.

585
01:03:15,460 --> 01:03:19,540
They've negotiated really good rates with this sort of this narrow network of providers.

586
01:03:20,140 --> 01:03:26,620
And either I get no coverage if I don't say in that network or I have to pay much higher out-of-pocket costs,

587
01:03:27,340 --> 01:03:30,460
I may be able to go out of network, but I've got to pay a lot more to do it.

588
01:03:32,210 --> 01:03:35,390
Want to do that, want to get care. Not only do I have to stay in the network.

589
01:03:36,830 --> 01:03:43,800
Or at least stay in the network to get the best cost sharing. I also have to meet various requirements.

590
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:50,700
Can I just call a cardiologist, make an appointment, go to my primary care doc and get a referral to cardiology.

591
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:55,200
Can I just get whatever test my doctor ordered?

592
01:03:55,320 --> 01:04:00,240
Well, probably not, because as far as some utilization review and pre-authorization for certain things.

593
01:04:01,610 --> 01:04:04,820
So there are hoops that I and my provider have to jump through.

594
01:04:06,860 --> 01:04:12,409
So it's kind of a you can pay me now or you can pay me later. Situation. Conventional fee for service.

595
01:04:12,410 --> 01:04:15,500
You pay a high premium now. Then they leave you alone.

596
01:04:15,780 --> 01:04:19,009
Their only function is to pay claims managed care.

597
01:04:19,010 --> 01:04:22,670
You pay a low premium now, but they don't leave your care.

598
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:27,710
They steer you to certain providers and they try to manage your utilization.

599
01:04:32,030 --> 01:04:36,830
So let's kind of just look at how broad product differentiation and health insurance.

600
01:04:37,220 --> 01:04:40,880
So indemnity insurance is just another word for sort conventional thing for service.

601
01:04:41,580 --> 01:04:45,370
Sort of the sense of an insurance target. Target. Okay.

602
01:04:45,380 --> 01:04:51,620
So who are the providers? Essentially everybody. Now, if I go across if I look at a PPO,

603
01:04:52,700 --> 01:04:57,439
most providers are in most peoples and some of them have lower coverage because the idea of a

604
01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:02,329
preferred provider is if you stay within the network that we're going to go share the best rates for,

605
01:05:02,330 --> 01:05:06,530
you get the lowest cost tutoring, but usually you get coverage regardless of where you go.

606
01:05:06,530 --> 01:05:10,010
But you might have to pay more if you want to go for network.

607
01:05:11,570 --> 01:05:19,370
And then some some HMO is kind of operate very similar to peoples in that regard and others are kind of the group staff model.

608
01:05:19,370 --> 01:05:25,220
They employ physicians. So really, if you're a Kaiser physician, you see Kaiser patients,

609
01:05:25,580 --> 01:05:30,500
you're not just contracting with Kaiser and you see patients from 50 other insurers as well.

610
01:05:32,010 --> 01:05:36,400
Okay, choice of providers, not just the patient who picks the providers.

611
01:05:36,410 --> 01:05:40,310
And then once you get into HMO, it's more of the gatekeeper of the kind of sends you to providers.

612
01:05:41,650 --> 01:05:47,770
And they kind of say within their network, okay, how are they paid fee for service?

613
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:56,110
Obviously, people are still primarily fee for service, but at a negotiated discounted rate and then it might be capitation.

614
01:05:56,110 --> 01:06:01,510
Where are you going to for a member per month for all primary care services or some may even be salaried?

615
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:06,200
So the Kaiser model physicians are salary cost sharing.

616
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:13,500
Well, since the conventional fee for service network plans really don't have these other ways of controlling spending,

617
01:06:14,140 --> 01:06:19,200
they may impose somewhat higher cost sharing. It's kind of the only hammer in their toolbox.

618
01:06:19,210 --> 01:06:23,910
So that's the hammer they're going to use to people.

619
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:29,290
It's kind of varies. You get very low cost sharing in network and higher cost sharing if you go out of the main network.

620
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:33,850
A similar for some HMO models, similar actually for a lot of HMO models.

621
01:06:34,990 --> 01:06:38,530
Insurers accept all the secured conventional fee for services.

622
01:06:38,530 --> 01:06:41,710
They pay bills. It's really their entire roll, their claim.

623
01:06:42,010 --> 01:06:46,360
They're nothing more than a claims processing agency. They collect the claim.

624
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:49,930
They try to verify that it's not fraudulent. And then they pay the claim.

625
01:06:52,960 --> 01:07:00,100
PPO is also reforming provider networks and managed care obviously is performing provider networks as well,

626
01:07:00,380 --> 01:07:04,630
which allows them to get to the group staff model. The Kaiser, they're actually the providers of care.

627
01:07:05,470 --> 01:07:10,870
Kaiser in California has their own hospitals, they have their own clinics, they have their own employee doctors.

628
01:07:11,530 --> 01:07:16,719
So they're actually not just a pair of care that's putting together a network and then paying for it.

629
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:25,540
But that network is still independent providers. They're actually providing care for Kaiser because they are an integrated system.

630
01:07:25,540 --> 01:07:30,850
Do they have like lower costs then because they're doing both functions or is that like higher?

631
01:07:33,130 --> 01:07:42,010
They can. But the answer, like you're probably surprised is it depends of if you look at hospital care, for example,

632
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:49,510
when Kaiser kind of started in California, it was sort of even before Medicare had the margins.

633
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:53,979
Hospitals tended to be full because it was fee for service.

634
01:07:53,980 --> 01:08:00,110
And the longer you kept the patient you the more premium charges you got to, you know, supply of empty beds.

635
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:07,600
So in that world, buying hospital care was very expensive because hospitals didn't really have to compete for insurance business.

636
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:09,820
Hey, I'm full know so well,

637
01:08:09,850 --> 01:08:17,140
I'm going to give you a 25% discount off what other payers are paying because I don't need to give you a discount to fill my beds.

638
01:08:17,980 --> 01:08:27,160
And now Medicare institutes the drug system, which is now a fixed payment per admission, which says once you're safe to leave the hospital,

639
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:33,730
I want you out of that bed because I've got to keep paying for your care if I keep you and I'm not getting another pay.

640
01:08:35,530 --> 01:08:38,110
Now, all of a sudden, there's excess capacity in hospitals.

641
01:08:38,470 --> 01:08:44,890
And Kaiser is a situation where now we could have been a buyer, we could have negotiated good rates with all these empty hospital beds.

642
01:08:45,370 --> 01:08:51,490
They would have been happy to take our patients that are good rate. So just when that market condition changed,

643
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:56,560
Kaiser went from having much lower costs for hospitalization because they could do it themselves

644
01:08:56,560 --> 01:09:01,870
and avoid having to pay very inflated costs of a very noncompetitive hospital sector.

645
01:09:02,250 --> 01:09:05,320
But all of a sudden hospitals would have been begging them for their business.

646
01:09:06,550 --> 01:09:15,160
So it kind of changed that kind of answer. What you're seeing now, I think that's one kind of good historical example of that, yes.

647
01:09:15,940 --> 01:09:21,069
Does the government have any concerns about conflict of interest with integrative systems?

648
01:09:21,070 --> 01:09:27,820
It seems strange to me that the person paying for your health care is also the person providing your health

649
01:09:27,820 --> 01:09:33,790
care and determining how much health care you can use and what's what's covered and what they're going to pay.

650
01:09:33,790 --> 01:09:43,989
I don't know. It seems kind of like an icky mess. So under the ACA there is the essential health benefit categories that sort of have to be covered.

651
01:09:43,990 --> 01:09:50,400
So that sort of puts a regulatory framework on on what has to be covered and what

652
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:54,460
what latitude they really have in saying something is completely non covered.

653
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:59,740
Other than that, there are possibility of lawsuits.

654
01:10:00,190 --> 01:10:07,360
So if I'm not covering care, that is sort of effective and within standard medical practice, I get sued.

655
01:10:07,930 --> 01:10:16,580
So that's what the legal system provides a check. The regulatory framework, particular under the ACA provides a check, reputation provides check,

656
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:21,760
potentially managed care got a very bad reputation for a number of years.

657
01:10:25,330 --> 01:10:29,830
HMO enrollment was rapidly growing and then it actually not only stopped growing,

658
01:10:29,830 --> 01:10:38,980
it shrunk rapidly because there was a period of time where they got a lot of bad press, some of it warranted, some of it just sensationalistic.

659
01:10:39,700 --> 01:10:40,899
But nonetheless, they got it.

660
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:48,610
They developed a very bad reputation and went from a growing share of the insurance market to a rapidly shrinking share of the insurance market.

661
01:10:49,210 --> 01:10:59,020
So those are kind of the main checks, you know, sort of there's the completely private check of just reputation and people's decisions.

662
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:04,690
There's the legal system track suing for non coverage and then there's the

663
01:11:04,690 --> 01:11:08,440
regulatory track of certain things have to be covered by all insurance plans.

664
01:11:10,050 --> 01:11:23,200
What is that bad reputation? So if they get bad reputation it's kind of the 1990s was sort of the peak of where they kind of grew very fast.

665
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:27,990
And then there was some cases where they did deny coverage, which got a lot of publicity.

666
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:34,860
One of them was denial of coverage for bone marrow transplants, for breast cancer patients.

667
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:41,680
And that got a lot of like 60 Minutes stories and other international news and things like that.

668
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:45,549
Turns out that was not an effective treatment. They were right to deny it.

669
01:11:45,550 --> 01:11:50,140
But at the time, it was not known that that it was still you know, they argued it was experimental.

670
01:11:50,650 --> 01:11:58,450
And the people suing them argued that there was enough evidence that it should have been covered as life saving care.

671
01:11:59,410 --> 01:12:05,319
It turned out, in retrospect, the families were right. Bone marrow transplantation is not done for breast cancer anymore.

672
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:07,780
It's done for some other things, but it's not proven effective.

673
01:12:08,710 --> 01:12:13,540
In fact, the one study that people were going on the shoulder was effective, turned out to be a fraudulent study.

674
01:12:16,930 --> 01:12:21,760
So that was one of the big things that got kind of got a lot of publicity shows are design stuff.

675
01:12:22,180 --> 01:12:29,669
And it was just sort of when you were a lot of people outside of California were Kaiser existing Seattle work group Health Collaborative.

676
01:12:29,670 --> 01:12:36,010
The Puget Sound existed a few of you the original kind of managed care plans that had developed strong reputations.

677
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:40,240
You know, people don't like to be told no when they think their life is on the line.

678
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:46,450
Yeah, they weren't used to that because of it, because families were new to most of the country and all of a sudden thought, wait a second,

679
01:12:46,450 --> 01:12:53,500
you're telling me I can't get get something that my doctor thinks I should get or that, you know, my cousin was a doctor thinks I should get.

680
01:12:55,060 --> 01:12:58,209
So that probably is a very incomplete explanation.

681
01:12:58,210 --> 01:13:02,830
But there was a lot of bad publicity. I think it's just people weren't used to it in most of the country.

682
01:13:02,860 --> 01:13:07,930
It was new. And all of a sudden, wait a second, people are saying, no, I don't like that.

683
01:13:09,190 --> 01:13:15,730
You know, and they kind of forgot the part of well, they're saying no, but I got a much lower premium to give them the right to say no.

684
01:13:16,270 --> 01:13:20,380
I could have paid a higher premium and stayed in a system that didn't say no.

685
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:33,270
So. And how is how is utilization limited in conventional insurers since are not managing the care process,

686
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:37,540
all they can do is try to manage the consumers cost sharing typically.

687
01:13:37,930 --> 01:13:44,890
So it's just demand, side control and utilization and then managed care and sort of supply side controls are influencing the providers

688
01:13:45,370 --> 01:13:54,900
peoples by selecting a network to get a better deal and then more direct limits on care as we moved down from.

689
01:14:00,180 --> 01:14:04,170
Okay. So how much choice do people really have? There's all this product differentiation.

690
01:14:04,260 --> 01:14:07,650
There are all these different types of insurance plans available.

691
01:14:08,700 --> 01:14:12,059
Now, what if you work for a company and you get your insurance company?

692
01:14:12,060 --> 01:14:16,830
They only offer one plan. So essentially, your employer made your choice for you.

693
01:14:17,220 --> 01:14:24,000
So in principle, there are all these types of insurance you could have chosen, but in reality, you did that choice.

694
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:33,420
And it really depends on how big your employer is. And so if we look at the largest firms, 5000 or more workers.

695
01:14:35,660 --> 01:14:39,710
Only about a quarter of them offer their employees only a single type of plan.

696
01:14:40,070 --> 01:14:45,170
They might have offered more than one plan, but if they offered more than one plan, it would be like two different peoples, for example.

697
01:14:46,010 --> 01:14:50,600
But it turns out the types of plans a quarter of large employers offered only one type of plans.

698
01:14:51,110 --> 01:14:58,130
Basically, half of them offer two types of plans, and another quarter of them offered three or more types of plans.

699
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:00,620
So that's in the largest employers.

700
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:08,870
So even in the largest employers, a substantial fraction of people didn't really have a lot of choice between different plan types.

701
01:15:09,620 --> 01:15:19,040
Now, if you look at small firms, those are kind of under 204 out of five, only offered one type of plan.

702
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:28,060
And only 3% offered three or more types of plants. So whether or not you as an individual employee have a choice.

703
01:15:29,480 --> 01:15:32,840
I want a fee for service plan to a lot of people. Do I want an HMO?

704
01:15:33,170 --> 01:15:40,650
Really depends on how big your employer is. Okay.

705
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:46,979
Now, what do people actually choose? So we've got conventional fee for service.

706
01:15:46,980 --> 01:15:50,340
Plans basically don't exist anymore.

707
01:15:51,810 --> 01:15:56,940
Everything is at least sort of kind of on the people level, there's at least some level of management.

708
01:15:59,350 --> 01:16:04,450
There's also this sort of new category, high deductible health plans with the saving option,

709
01:16:04,900 --> 01:16:08,710
otherwise known as consumer directed health plans or consumer driven health plans.

710
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:12,610
You've heard that term. I have. If you had one.

711
01:16:13,540 --> 01:16:17,770
No, I just give a big presentation. I mean, what do you think?

712
01:16:18,850 --> 01:16:22,810
I don't want one. What's the problem with them?

713
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:30,700
They have high deductibles and I have health needs. I have to bear a lot of the cost upfront, even though I get a lower premium.

714
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:37,900
The lower premium doesn't offset the higher cost. The deductible out-of-pocket costs that I have to meet before the insurance kicks in.

715
01:16:38,830 --> 01:16:42,910
So these plans, you would have to have, say, typically like a $5,000 deductible,

716
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:49,410
and then you get a health savings account which you and or your employer can contribute money to,

717
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:54,640
and you can use that health savings account to try to pay part of your expenses before you meet the deductible.

718
01:16:55,270 --> 01:17:01,120
But there's usually a donut hole, there's a big gap in your health savings account, might have a couple of thousand dollars in it.

719
01:17:01,150 --> 01:17:05,460
Well, you've got a $5,000 deductible and spend down that health savings account.

720
01:17:05,470 --> 01:17:10,680
You still face things like table and you have an incentive not to even spend that

721
01:17:10,690 --> 01:17:14,980
savings account because you can roll it over to your money to keep from year to year.

722
01:17:15,010 --> 01:17:22,130
So it's not a use it or lose it like a flexible spending account. So University of Michigan doesn't offer one of these plans.

723
01:17:22,180 --> 01:17:30,010
We do offer a flexible spending account. That's where I can put money in to pay for it out of pocket health care expenses with pretax dollars.

724
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:38,350
So that's a reason I would do it. But if I don't spend it this year, usually a few months grace period until the next year, that money disappears.

725
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:46,450
So if I put $1,000 in my FSA and I only spend $100 this year, I've just thrown $900 away.

726
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:51,220
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to get next to a year's worth of contact lenses in December.

727
01:17:58,030 --> 01:18:01,929
So obviously these add up to more than 100% when you add them up, because some employers,

728
01:18:01,930 --> 01:18:07,450
like you shown in the previous graph, offered more than one time. But right now the most common is PPO.

729
01:18:08,050 --> 01:18:17,500
Point of service plan is sort of a a PPO or HMO plus out-of-network coverage, really, or an HMO plus out-of-network coverage, higher cost sharing.

730
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:21,880
So it's not a strict or HMO, literally. There's no out of the word coverage.

731
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:25,299
If you have to go to the network, the point of service is like an HMO.

732
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:31,240
But we have sort of an option to go out of network for higher out-of-pocket costs.

733
01:18:33,980 --> 01:18:39,440
You can see how the likelihood of offering these things depends on the size of the firm.

734
01:18:44,750 --> 01:18:52,090
So managed care organizations really do is they try to sort of solve the shopping problem in health care by becoming your shopper.

735
01:18:53,810 --> 01:18:58,070
They negotiate the prices for you. They negotiate the network. They negotiate the discounts.

736
01:19:00,940 --> 01:19:05,019
So the things that are hard for me to do as an individual in the midst of a heart attack,

737
01:19:05,020 --> 01:19:08,530
I'm not going to go call five hospitals and try to negotiate a better price.

738
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:15,700
But hopefully, if I'm in a good insurance network, they've already negotiated a good price for me,

739
01:19:17,140 --> 01:19:24,549
hopefully reflective of that in the premiums they charge me. So the MCO at the managed care organization has the ability to negotiate that

740
01:19:24,550 --> 01:19:31,210
because they have the leverage of being a lot of patients they represent. You want access to our 300,000 enrollees.

741
01:19:31,990 --> 01:19:35,700
As a hospital, you cut us a deal. You don't get a deal.

742
01:19:35,710 --> 01:19:40,030
You don't get access to our 300,000 enrollees. I, as an individual patient, don't have that power.

743
01:19:40,930 --> 01:19:46,040
Even if I had the ability to shop, even if it wasn't an emergency where I couldn't shop, I'm one person.

744
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:51,430
I'm negotiating against a huge health system. And who's going to win that negotiation?

745
01:19:53,910 --> 01:19:58,770
Do you think I'm that brilliant of a negotiator? I've got no leverage now.
