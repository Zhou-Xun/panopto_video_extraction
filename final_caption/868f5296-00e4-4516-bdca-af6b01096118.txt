1
00:00:02,795 --> 00:00:07,715
Good morning. Good morning, everyone. Let's go ahead and get started.

2
00:00:09,185 --> 00:00:12,515
I hope everyone is doing well this morning.

3
00:00:13,475 --> 00:00:20,195
I sent a note out kind of early this morning inviting folks to bring their laptops.

4
00:00:20,345 --> 00:00:29,555
So you may or may not have seen that message. We're going to do a little exercise today in which they would be helpful if you don't have one.

5
00:00:29,585 --> 00:00:35,165
Hopefully, we'll be able to figure it out and make it work. But I just wanted to mention that before we jump in.

6
00:00:36,185 --> 00:00:39,815
So let's talk about our plan for today.

7
00:00:41,765 --> 00:00:45,545
I'm going to start out if I can get folks to start talking, please.

8
00:00:45,895 --> 00:00:50,165
It would be appreciated. Okay.

9
00:00:50,165 --> 00:00:53,525
Thank you. Here's our agenda for today.

10
00:00:53,555 --> 00:00:58,745
We're going to start out with a little bit of housekeeping. I want to check in and see if folks have any questions.

11
00:00:59,555 --> 00:01:04,145
Usual objectives. I'm going to spend a very quick moment on in the news.

12
00:01:05,195 --> 00:01:08,585
A little shorter exercise today than the last time.

13
00:01:09,395 --> 00:01:17,075
And then we're going to continue where we left off in terms of thinking about how do we conceptualize social determinants of health,

14
00:01:17,075 --> 00:01:19,955
how do we think about population health, etc.?

15
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:26,315
And hopefully through a couple of examples remind you of some of the things that we've been talking about.

16
00:01:26,435 --> 00:01:33,605
Okay. So that's our plan for today. Looking ahead to next Wednesday, which is the next time we'll meet,

17
00:01:33,995 --> 00:01:39,874
we're going to start a unit on thinking about racism as a structural determinant of health.

18
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:42,365
We'll say a little bit more about what that means next week.

19
00:01:43,205 --> 00:01:49,385
There's a little more than I typically ask folks to do for next week because we have a week until we meet.

20
00:01:50,285 --> 00:01:55,264
And so I just want to tell you for now, don't wait until Tuesday night.

21
00:01:55,265 --> 00:02:00,965
There's a couple of podcasts I have on there, a couple of there's a TED Talk.

22
00:02:01,415 --> 00:02:06,965
So trying to mix up the media too, which we use to prepare for class.

23
00:02:07,805 --> 00:02:11,555
I think the Health Equity podcast is about 25 minutes or so.

24
00:02:12,035 --> 00:02:20,225
How racism makes us sick is maybe 10 minutes or something like that, so just prepare yourself a little more reading than usual.

25
00:02:20,225 --> 00:02:24,155
But it's because we go another week before we before we meet.

26
00:02:24,155 --> 00:02:27,484
So just heads up for that. All right.

27
00:02:27,485 --> 00:02:33,844
Housekeeping and questions. I've met with at least one person so far for office hours.

28
00:02:33,845 --> 00:02:38,915
I think we had someone else show up today, so this was great.

29
00:02:38,915 --> 00:02:44,375
I enjoyed hearing some feedback on how the class is going and just getting to know the student I met with.

30
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:50,674
I want to again encourage you all to meet with us, sign up for office hours.

31
00:02:50,675 --> 00:02:55,625
I know I have a slew of people coming tomorrow, so that's great. I'm looking forward to that.

32
00:02:56,585 --> 00:03:04,174
I am kind of sometimes here in SDH and sometimes at home.

33
00:03:04,175 --> 00:03:08,885
So there's always a remote link set up for all of the GSI.

34
00:03:09,595 --> 00:03:18,695
I think if I am going to be here, I will let you know that so that if you want to come and meet in person, you can feel free to do that.

35
00:03:18,695 --> 00:03:28,835
So again, just encouraging folks to come to our office hours participation reminder, just a note to say your name before your comments.

36
00:03:29,515 --> 00:03:33,485
If you have a name that's not common, you probably don't need your last initial.

37
00:03:33,845 --> 00:03:39,095
But if you know someone else in the cohort has your name a second in this or may help.

38
00:03:40,205 --> 00:03:43,475
Och survey. We are combing through your responses.

39
00:03:43,805 --> 00:03:49,774
We'll have a more formal sort of discussion of some of the things we saw in the

40
00:03:49,775 --> 00:03:54,424
surveys and that we're going to do for the rest of the semester next Wednesday.

41
00:03:54,425 --> 00:03:57,965
So just a heads up for that. Thank you to everyone for doing that.

42
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:04,805
We got pretty close to 100% and then journal responses were due at 11 a.m.

43
00:04:05,795 --> 00:04:08,344
Uh, I was taking a look through these.

44
00:04:08,345 --> 00:04:17,945
I was up really late last night, and I have to say that I was extremely impressed with the responses that I saw coming in last night.

45
00:04:18,785 --> 00:04:26,645
Folks are clearly really locked into the material and just the thought people were going way above expectations,

46
00:04:26,645 --> 00:04:28,895
as you've probably seen from some of your group members.

47
00:04:29,495 --> 00:04:38,015
Some folks had already responded to their peers as very clear that you are thinking deeply about the content.

48
00:04:38,025 --> 00:04:41,525
So this is exactly what we want to see. Keep it coming.

49
00:04:41,885 --> 00:04:54,035
You've got another one due next Wednesday. You have some options so you can choose to get it done pretty quickly and respond based on today's class.

50
00:04:54,755 --> 00:05:00,485
Or you might do some of the readings for next Wednesday's class and work some of that into your journal response.

51
00:05:00,485 --> 00:05:05,735
So it's up to you. We're not looking for any specific content per say.

52
00:05:06,305 --> 00:05:10,684
We're just looking for you to thoughtfully respond and engage with the course content.

53
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:17,435
So that's on Journal notes that many of you have already responded to your peers,

54
00:05:18,065 --> 00:05:23,015
but for those of you who have not, the responses are due by Friday at midnight.

55
00:05:23,105 --> 00:05:26,795
Okay, so I try to send out a reminder on Friday morning.

56
00:05:27,335 --> 00:05:31,775
Sometimes I don't get to do that, but that's due by Friday night.

57
00:05:32,615 --> 00:05:37,625
All right. Any questions on logistics or anything else?

58
00:05:39,095 --> 00:05:44,435
That you've been wondering about, of course, related. Are following along.

59
00:05:44,465 --> 00:05:48,425
Everything's going all right. Okay. All right.

60
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:57,085
So what we want to do today is pick up where we left off on Monday.

61
00:05:57,625 --> 00:06:02,545
We want to continue to think about these key, core concepts, what they mean.

62
00:06:03,715 --> 00:06:11,245
Many of you and your journal entries were talking about. Oh, yeah, you know, I'm really glad there was the, you know, sort of policy action component.

63
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:17,695
I haven't thought about that that deeply. Or you talked about other aspects of the definitions that you thought were interesting.

64
00:06:18,265 --> 00:06:25,405
So we're going to continue doing that. We're also going to talk about some of the mechanisms by which these things happen.

65
00:06:25,405 --> 00:06:28,945
So I gave you a little thought exercise at the end of the last class,

66
00:06:29,695 --> 00:06:35,365
and I'm actually going to ask you today to think about one particular disparity in particular.

67
00:06:36,445 --> 00:06:44,425
And then we're going to add on an exercise where we think about models of social determinants of health.

68
00:06:44,545 --> 00:06:53,275
Okay. I'm always surprised because at the end of the semester, when folks reflect on the entire semester and how it's gone,

69
00:06:53,965 --> 00:07:03,774
folks often identify this exercise and think about the models as one of the most thought provoking exercises of the semester.

70
00:07:03,775 --> 00:07:10,195
So we're going to do that last and add that onto some of these things we've already been thinking about.

71
00:07:11,275 --> 00:07:17,424
Okay. Before we do that in the news, take some of you in your journal entries.

72
00:07:17,425 --> 00:07:20,675
Found this article very interesting. This is us.

73
00:07:20,695 --> 00:07:30,415
Life expectancy in the notes. You'll see a couple of key points from the article rather than have a discussion today.

74
00:07:30,775 --> 00:07:34,255
I just want to highlight a couple of key points from the article.

75
00:07:34,945 --> 00:07:43,615
So we know that life expectancy over the last little bit has been getting longer and longer and longer.

76
00:07:44,335 --> 00:07:52,495
In fact, the text book that we have for this course, which was written prior to the pandemic, says, Whew, we're doing great.

77
00:07:53,185 --> 00:07:57,925
We're not too far from average life expectancy of 80 years of age.

78
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:06,804
Unfortunately, this thing happened in 2019, 2020, which slowed us down a little bit.

79
00:08:06,805 --> 00:08:17,005
And so as you read in the article, life expectancy has now decreased for the last two years or so, mostly pandemic related.

80
00:08:17,425 --> 00:08:23,965
But as the article spoke about, there's also been an increase in unintentional injuries.

81
00:08:23,965 --> 00:08:33,895
So things like drug overdose. And the article talked about how a lot of the sort of decrease in life expectancy that we've seen has to

82
00:08:33,895 --> 00:08:42,055
do with COVID 19 and an increase in these unintentional injuries as we talk about population health.

83
00:08:42,445 --> 00:08:48,024
One of the things that the definitions honed in on is that it's not just about the outcome.

84
00:08:48,025 --> 00:08:56,004
It's not just about a decrease in life expectancy, but that there are a range, there's a distribution of outcomes.

85
00:08:56,005 --> 00:09:05,515
Right. So one of the things we know probably not new to most of you is that even though life expectancy has decreased,

86
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:10,105
the amount by which is decreased is variable for different groups.

87
00:09:10,885 --> 00:09:18,415
And surprise, surprise, some of the groups that there's a bigger gap for for racial and ethnic minorities.

88
00:09:19,105 --> 00:09:23,934
You saw even in the article that we read that people who have the highest rates

89
00:09:23,935 --> 00:09:31,615
from drug overdose in 2020 and 21 American Indian Alaska Native populations,

90
00:09:32,395 --> 00:09:38,845
black populations or black people, and they also talked about native Hawaiians as well,

91
00:09:39,355 --> 00:09:47,095
and Pacific Islanders as having the greatest increase in these overdose categories.

92
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:57,955
So a question we should be asking ourselves is why do we continue to have this distribution within these groups, within the entire population?

93
00:09:58,945 --> 00:10:05,004
Some of the things that the article talked about had to do with fentanyl, for example,

94
00:10:05,005 --> 00:10:15,835
and noting that it's easier access may explain why we're seeing this reversal and this increase in accidental drug overdoses.

95
00:10:16,615 --> 00:10:22,854
They talked about how heroin is, you know, less potent than if heroin were more available.

96
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:26,255
Then we wouldn't see the same kind of discrepancy.

97
00:10:26,295 --> 00:10:31,345
So fentanyl, the access to it is identified as a key factor.

98
00:10:32,005 --> 00:10:35,745
They also talked about the lack of access to treatment.

99
00:10:36,175 --> 00:10:41,765
So that's really variable. And in fact, some of you wrote about this in your journal entries.

100
00:10:42,445 --> 00:10:48,115
We know that the types of treatment that are available vary in different communities.

101
00:10:48,535 --> 00:10:54,495
So. Buprenorphine, which is often used for opioid treatments.

102
00:10:55,275 --> 00:11:01,004
There have been several research papers written showing that buprenorphine is available,

103
00:11:01,005 --> 00:11:11,025
more likely to be available in white communities than it is in lower resourced or black and people of color.

104
00:11:11,265 --> 00:11:21,585
Communities of people of color. You're more likely to see methadone treatment in African-American black communities.

105
00:11:21,585 --> 00:11:27,075
And so there's a a discrepancy there in terms of why are the treatments different.

106
00:11:27,705 --> 00:11:31,125
We know that methadone is harder to get access to.

107
00:11:31,515 --> 00:11:35,685
And so there's some unequal playing fields here.

108
00:11:36,645 --> 00:11:43,965
They also talked about waivers, waivers in order to be able to prescribe buprenorphine.

109
00:11:44,715 --> 00:11:48,795
You've got to have the waivers. Waivers require training.

110
00:11:49,725 --> 00:11:57,465
And there's an unequal footing in terms of which clinics and clinicians have access to the training.

111
00:11:57,915 --> 00:12:06,975
So all of that also influences these discrepancies that we see in in the population subgroups.

112
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:16,155
Okay. The last quick thing I'll say, sort of key point from this article has to do with thinking about and the article talked about this a little bit,

113
00:12:17,175 --> 00:12:22,325
why how we can address these these sorts of issues.

114
00:12:22,335 --> 00:12:30,345
So they talked about policy changes to increase or decrease the barriers to having the waivers.

115
00:12:30,945 --> 00:12:40,424
There have been several papers published that have shown even when you adjust for or make the waivers more available, you still don't see.

116
00:12:40,425 --> 00:12:44,325
That wouldn't be enough to reduce the gaps completely.

117
00:12:45,315 --> 00:12:53,325
And so one of the arguments the paper hints at is that if we really want to get at changing

118
00:12:53,325 --> 00:12:57,855
rates of substance use and the reasons that people are using substances in the first place,

119
00:12:58,365 --> 00:13:06,225
you've got to get to the root cause of the issue. So things like intergenerational trauma are not being addressed.

120
00:13:06,265 --> 00:13:14,955
We can have policy that changes waivers for buprenorphine, but if you're not getting at the intergenerational trauma,

121
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:21,585
particularly in some of the communities that are most impacted, you're really not going to see a change.

122
00:13:22,395 --> 00:13:30,135
And so as we go forward in this course, one of the things we're thinking about a lot is not just kind of surface level,

123
00:13:31,215 --> 00:13:38,565
but what are the structural factors that contribute to the underlying fundamental causes?

124
00:13:38,955 --> 00:13:44,915
Okay. All right. Let me pause there. That was mostly summative in terms of the article.

125
00:13:44,925 --> 00:13:52,005
Any questions about the life expectancy article or what comments before we move on?

126
00:13:55,985 --> 00:13:59,495
Okay. All right. Excuse me.

127
00:14:00,845 --> 00:14:06,875
All right. So a couple review slides here just to pick up where we left off the last time.

128
00:14:07,955 --> 00:14:11,165
Population health, again, focusing on health outcomes.

129
00:14:12,275 --> 00:14:19,085
We've got these policies and programs that are important and we talked about how these

130
00:14:19,085 --> 00:14:25,895
things there's distribution within the population that's important to take into account.

131
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:30,845
We also name some of the different determinants and factors that are important to consider.

132
00:14:31,235 --> 00:14:38,075
I did see in several of your general responses people critiquing the arrows, asking questions about the arrows.

133
00:14:38,435 --> 00:14:45,565
So good thinking there. This is a new slide, something I'm adding on that we didn't talk about.

134
00:14:46,045 --> 00:14:54,514
Yes. On Monday, I want you to be aware of a couple of recent trends and disparities.

135
00:14:54,515 --> 00:14:58,615
So this is epidemiological data we talked about.

136
00:14:59,005 --> 00:15:02,725
I gave you many different examples of disparities that exist.

137
00:15:03,745 --> 00:15:13,985
Here are a couple more things just to be aware of. So when we think about HIV, AIDS epidemic, we know that our medicines have progressed.

138
00:15:14,005 --> 00:15:18,215
We know that folks are living longer lives.

139
00:15:18,235 --> 00:15:20,575
It's not a death sentence, etc., etc.

140
00:15:21,685 --> 00:15:31,735
However, when you look at population subgroups, racial and ethnic minorities, and again, I won't go into details here,

141
00:15:32,245 --> 00:15:40,645
but there are population subgroups that still seem to be at a higher risk for contracting HIV and dying of HIV AIDS.

142
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:49,194
Even though we're 40, 50 years after this epidemic, this is one of the reasons when COVID 19,

143
00:15:49,195 --> 00:15:52,975
when we saw these discrepancies and people were really surprised.

144
00:15:54,055 --> 00:15:58,975
You know, there were several people who said and actually it's not that surprising.

145
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:05,095
We have many diseases that have been around where we still see these discrepancies.

146
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:14,215
So even though as a population, the curve has gone down, people are living longer, outcomes more favorable with HIV AIDS.

147
00:16:15,235 --> 00:16:19,554
It's not the same for all groups. Okay. Another example.

148
00:16:19,555 --> 00:16:23,105
This is even pre-pandemic cause specific rates.

149
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:27,985
So for some reason, poisonings and suicide.

150
00:16:29,665 --> 00:16:43,055
2000 to 2 for 2014, especially ages 30 to 64, see an increase in the death rates for poisoning and suicide.

151
00:16:43,075 --> 00:16:49,734
So similar to the article we just read. What are some reasons that you're familiar with?

152
00:16:49,735 --> 00:16:56,405
Or if you had to generate a list of why you think that poisonings and suicide have gone up?

153
00:16:56,425 --> 00:16:59,605
What what are some reasons that you would attribute that to?

154
00:16:59,855 --> 00:17:07,365
Yeah. I'm Lita.

155
00:17:07,755 --> 00:17:13,185
I think that the there are more prescriptions going out for opioids.

156
00:17:14,115 --> 00:17:19,875
And I think that, like there was a push to get doctors to prescribe more opioids around that time.

157
00:17:20,265 --> 00:17:24,645
Okay. So opioids and that's going to lead to, you're saying more suicide.

158
00:17:25,785 --> 00:17:31,965
Are you making that connection or what? I think the availability of it makes it so that that can be a mechanism.

159
00:17:32,175 --> 00:17:35,395
Okay. All right. Good. Anyone else? Thank you.

160
00:17:35,595 --> 00:17:40,095
The other reasons why you might see the increase in suicide.

161
00:17:40,365 --> 00:17:45,595
Unintentional injuries. Hi. I'm a rishi with suicide.

162
00:17:45,615 --> 00:17:55,934
I think I mean, there are a lot of factors of like mental health declining, but also recently with the pandemic issues with like economic factors,

163
00:17:55,935 --> 00:18:01,605
specifically job loss or like unable to support yourself or your family could

164
00:18:01,605 --> 00:18:06,795
lead to like like mental decline and just feeling like a lack of support,

165
00:18:06,795 --> 00:18:11,745
especially, which I think can drive up suicide numbers.

166
00:18:12,135 --> 00:18:24,165
Okay. So lack of support, economic factors, even though these data are pre-pandemic, you had 28 is a financial crash,

167
00:18:24,165 --> 00:18:31,695
if you will, then you've had a number of periods where jobs, economic opportunities have decreased.

168
00:18:31,725 --> 00:18:34,694
Okay, let's get their like three or four more people. Yes, please.

169
00:18:34,695 --> 00:18:42,915
And then my name is Christina, and I was going to talk about gun control and the ease of gun access for both intentional and unintentional suicides.

170
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:48,825
They're just so easy to access and such an easy mechanism for suicide.

171
00:18:49,305 --> 00:18:52,874
Okay. So gun control, we know that's related to policy.

172
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:57,465
It's another hot topic. So thank you for that. Was there another comment back here?

173
00:18:57,645 --> 00:19:02,684
My name is Vera and I think the cost of like therapy and getting help can be very

174
00:19:02,685 --> 00:19:07,365
costly and sometimes lead to suicide and not like actually going and asking for help.

175
00:19:08,055 --> 00:19:17,954
Okay. So access to the cost of treatment and this also I don't know if the article talked about it that we read for in the news today,

176
00:19:17,955 --> 00:19:21,975
but the cost of methods and the cost of treatment,

177
00:19:21,975 --> 00:19:27,765
another factor we didn't talk about is mistrust and being worried that if I go for treatment,

178
00:19:28,155 --> 00:19:34,875
I may be taken by the legal system or I may get in trouble. But absolutely, that's a factor as well.

179
00:19:35,345 --> 00:19:37,755
Okay. I think I saw a mike over here. Yes, please.

180
00:19:38,025 --> 00:19:47,175
Hi, I'm Libby, and I am wondering if the media could also be playing a role and not maybe poisonings as much as, like suicides.

181
00:19:47,955 --> 00:19:57,825
I think in the recent past, especially like people our age are watching, you know, media or TV shows that are really putting suicide in the spotlight.

182
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:04,755
And maybe for some people, you know, like Gloria Rising, what do I want to say?

183
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:09,855
Like making it something that's entertaining and putting it in the media.

184
00:20:10,095 --> 00:20:16,965
And young minds are seeing that. And especially, I guess the ages are older, but in general people are talking about it more.

185
00:20:17,415 --> 00:20:21,435
Okay. So Libby is kind of suggesting that there's a media component to it,

186
00:20:21,465 --> 00:20:26,805
that some of the representations of suicide may make it something that people

187
00:20:26,805 --> 00:20:32,745
are thinking about more or may increase the numbers in terms of awareness.

188
00:20:33,285 --> 00:20:37,125
Okay, these are all great ideas.

189
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:46,815
I heard some thinking about specific mechanisms. So economic factors may lead to, you know, depression and sadness.

190
00:20:46,815 --> 00:20:52,245
And so people may use substances or they may take their own lives because of the

191
00:20:52,245 --> 00:20:58,214
pressure of the economic or structural factors being able to afford care and treatment,

192
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:01,395
etc. All good examples here.

193
00:21:02,295 --> 00:21:08,295
Aaron, please. I just wanted to add on I can't remember who said about the cost of mental health services,

194
00:21:08,295 --> 00:21:12,225
but as a part of a clinical psychology graduate program, I'm also a therapist.

195
00:21:12,945 --> 00:21:18,885
One of the challenges with providing effective care to individuals who are experiencing suicidal

196
00:21:18,885 --> 00:21:24,915
ideation or who are actively suicidal is that insurance companies jack up the cost of like,

197
00:21:24,915 --> 00:21:28,245
I want to provide care to individuals who experience suicidal ideation.

198
00:21:28,515 --> 00:21:33,015
So in a lot of ways, that cost increase is not just because the therapist sets it,

199
00:21:33,255 --> 00:21:38,895
but because insurance companies say, like, this is a very high risk client who has the potential to die by suicide.

200
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:42,614
So it's not just like the therapist sits there like, yeah, I'm in charge.

201
00:21:42,615 --> 00:21:45,795
$300 a session is like insurance companies might do that.

202
00:21:46,005 --> 00:21:53,175
And in addition to that, a lot of these therapist training programs don't necessarily teach us how to support individuals who are actively suicidal.

203
00:21:53,775 --> 00:21:58,325
Okay, great. Thank you for that. Okay.

204
00:21:58,335 --> 00:22:01,725
So it's a little bit on cost specific rates.

205
00:22:01,775 --> 00:22:05,705
Good thinking. There are other trends you may be aware of.

206
00:22:05,705 --> 00:22:09,425
Cardiovascular disease weigh down if we look over the past 50 years.

207
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:16,114
But obesity rates are going through the roof right through a number of groups.

208
00:22:16,115 --> 00:22:25,685
And so there's actually a concern here that even though cardiovascular rates, cardiovascular disease has gone down overall,

209
00:22:26,555 --> 00:22:34,325
many scientists are beginning to predict that the life expectancy was going to stall because eventually,

210
00:22:34,325 --> 00:22:36,005
even though the rates have gone down,

211
00:22:36,365 --> 00:22:44,525
the increase in obesity is going to lead to greater health problems that just haven't been experienced by the population yet.

212
00:22:44,975 --> 00:22:50,155
So and people may actually related to that.

213
00:22:50,165 --> 00:22:57,935
I have it up here the next point, and we're also starting to see greater increases in activity, limitations,

214
00:22:58,265 --> 00:23:06,305
disabilities and things that prevent people from being physically active during their later in the life span.

215
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:14,885
And so one of the reasons it's thought that this is happening is because of all of the different factors that you see there under obesity.

216
00:23:15,365 --> 00:23:23,135
And there's also been the argument that it's going to be really difficult to kind of stave off some of these

217
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:31,465
increases because of the powerful industries that are making a lot of money from things that are related to obesity.

218
00:23:31,475 --> 00:23:40,475
Okay. So that's another consideration as we think about the multiple multiple levels of a structure that impact health, population, health.

219
00:23:41,465 --> 00:23:47,405
Okay. A few more examples. I already mentioned the first bullet I want to spend just a second on this one,

220
00:23:47,405 --> 00:23:53,794
in part because I read a journal entry last night and someone was trying the exercise and they said,

221
00:23:53,795 --> 00:23:57,754
you know, I can think of reasons for socioeconomic status.

222
00:23:57,755 --> 00:24:09,335
I can think of reasons why LGBT populations, but I'm really stumped by women living longer about having more health problems.

223
00:24:09,965 --> 00:24:12,755
So let's talk about that a little bit before we do.

224
00:24:13,805 --> 00:24:24,905
There's a supplemental reading under additional resources in the today's module that has a it's called recent problematic trends.

225
00:24:24,905 --> 00:24:34,714
So if you want to read more details there, you can. One of the things that that excerpt or that chapter shows is that women's life expectancy

226
00:24:34,715 --> 00:24:41,524
in the US is actually among the worst of all the sort of so-called high income countries.

227
00:24:41,525 --> 00:24:51,905
Okay, so why is it that us women have shorter life spans than women in other high income countries?

228
00:24:52,745 --> 00:25:03,335
If you look at the changes in women's life expectancy, it's really trailing and this is pre-pandemic, it's really trotting along 3.3 years.

229
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:12,785
I don't know what time period, but if you look at other countries, there's a steeper increase in women's life expectancy that you don't see in the US.

230
00:25:13,055 --> 00:25:17,825
Okay. There's also what I have called here class intersectionality.

231
00:25:18,545 --> 00:25:24,905
So you remember from chapter one that women who don't have a high school or college

232
00:25:24,905 --> 00:25:32,645
degree are more impacted in terms of their health outcomes than men are for say,

233
00:25:32,765 --> 00:25:38,165
okay, what's going on here? Why do we see these discrepancies?

234
00:25:39,065 --> 00:25:49,805
What are some reasons you think there might be explanations for why either women in the US or why we see these disparities with regard to women?

235
00:25:52,995 --> 00:25:55,885
Thank you. Sure. Hi.

236
00:25:55,895 --> 00:26:05,614
My name is Judah, and I think that one reason could be abortion access or lack of where women don't have the resources they need to access abortions.

237
00:26:05,615 --> 00:26:12,845
So they either choose to resort to more dangerous means or take their lives maybe.

238
00:26:13,415 --> 00:26:24,225
Okay. Drastic things. Okay. Thank you, Sanjay. So there's differences across countries in terms of access to abortion care, for example.

239
00:26:24,245 --> 00:26:27,445
Yes, there are a few more. Did you want to add to that or. Okay.

240
00:26:27,905 --> 00:26:31,215
So. My name is Amelia.

241
00:26:31,935 --> 00:26:37,805
Kind of similarly, like the U.S. has a higher rate of maternal mortality than a lot of other high income countries.

242
00:26:37,815 --> 00:26:42,464
So if we're looking at women of childbearing age, if they're dying in childbirth at higher rates,

243
00:26:42,465 --> 00:26:47,505
that would just bring down the general life expectancy for women overall compared to other high income countries.

244
00:26:47,535 --> 00:26:53,115
Okay, good. Amelia? Mm hmm. Okay. One more comment and then I'll jump in.

245
00:26:53,145 --> 00:26:56,385
Go ahead, please. Hi. My name is Maya.

246
00:26:57,015 --> 00:27:01,515
I think that one big reason is that women's pain is taken less seriously.

247
00:27:01,845 --> 00:27:07,415
And on average, women are diagnosed with diseases and illnesses later than men.

248
00:27:07,425 --> 00:27:17,055
And that class discrepancy is widened because in another class of men, like we talk a lot about how education reflects class.

249
00:27:17,055 --> 00:27:21,915
And when you get a college degree, a lot of people are told that their voice matters.

250
00:27:21,915 --> 00:27:27,765
And as a result, people who are less educated may be less likely to advocate for themselves.

251
00:27:27,795 --> 00:27:33,635
So that disparity. Okay. So pain may not be taken as seriously.

252
00:27:33,645 --> 00:27:41,565
We've got differences in terms of maternal mortality, but why?

253
00:27:41,565 --> 00:27:47,835
We have one more. Maybe we can get one more comment over here. Why are women not taken as seriously?

254
00:27:48,435 --> 00:27:52,215
I wonder. Well, we'll come to you. Oh, okay.

255
00:27:53,595 --> 00:27:57,905
Yeah. Like Nancy Grace.

256
00:27:58,145 --> 00:28:05,045
Oh, sorry. My name is Alex. What I was talking about in my like this relates to my journal topic I wrote is that when I was reading it,

257
00:28:05,075 --> 00:28:08,285
I saw that, you know, the lower levels of education,

258
00:28:09,155 --> 00:28:16,684
there was like many discrepancies in like the specific populations obviously were those with are like the decrease in the increase the mortality rate

259
00:28:16,685 --> 00:28:20,585
among the white population that was that was talked about in the article

260
00:28:20,975 --> 00:28:26,735
specifically for people with lower levels of education causes being overdoses,

261
00:28:26,735 --> 00:28:32,405
suicide and cirrhosis of the liver, which kind of like give you a picture of what's actually happening.

262
00:28:32,405 --> 00:28:36,934
And I feel like, like the, like seen this in the communities that I grew up in.

263
00:28:36,935 --> 00:28:46,715
Coming from a low income background, I could I see that like many people are stuck and these in these unfortunate situations they feel there's

264
00:28:46,715 --> 00:28:52,715
a lot of like despair and like people are like stuck in these these lives that they feel trapped in.

265
00:28:53,015 --> 00:29:01,835
And it all relates back to like the structural determinants, how that they didn't like in these communities there's really like underfunded

266
00:29:01,835 --> 00:29:06,844
public education and there's not many opportunities to get out of these situations.

267
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:08,975
Go to college like all of us are college students.

268
00:29:09,335 --> 00:29:18,535
This experience has been enriching in so many ways that opens many doors that those that don't have the option to go to college don't have access to.

269
00:29:18,815 --> 00:29:21,955
And so it's it's just really unfortunate that, you know,

270
00:29:21,965 --> 00:29:29,045
we're seeing these increasing mortality rates because of one of the big social towards helping quality access to education.

271
00:29:29,405 --> 00:29:36,514
So like, I just I can see that I can see that's been a big factor is obviously trying to self coping

272
00:29:36,515 --> 00:29:41,585
methods such as alcohol which can lead to cirrhosis which can lead to alcohol poisoning,

273
00:29:41,975 --> 00:29:45,995
feelings of suicide, etc. So I went on a tangent there.

274
00:29:46,145 --> 00:29:50,045
Okay. So Alex, I have a question on income.

275
00:29:50,055 --> 00:29:58,025
And so one is just quickly in a sentence or two, education, lack of education, how does that lead to health disparities?

276
00:29:59,075 --> 00:30:04,865
Yeah, so lower levels of education, like a poor quality of education, you don't have the opportunities to get a college degree.

277
00:30:05,075 --> 00:30:13,025
College degree is directly associated with with income income being directly related to the opportunities to receive health care.

278
00:30:13,075 --> 00:30:16,835
Okay. Okay. I could go on. Sorry. Okay. All right, good.

279
00:30:17,675 --> 00:30:26,855
So the one. So Alex is on the money. What I would want to add to that is thinking about why are women?

280
00:30:26,855 --> 00:30:31,205
And so I go back to my question about why are women taking this seriously?

281
00:30:31,685 --> 00:30:36,785
Why is there higher maternal mortality?

282
00:30:38,255 --> 00:30:42,605
Folks are alluding to more use of drugs or stress.

283
00:30:43,505 --> 00:30:46,715
Why? Why are they not taken seriously?

284
00:30:47,625 --> 00:30:51,335
And we'll take one comment and then I'll leave it as kind of a talk question.

285
00:30:51,335 --> 00:30:55,415
Sorry, I don't have another mike and I don't know where they are.

286
00:30:59,575 --> 00:31:02,845
Maybe if I can keep one down here, that might be a good idea.

287
00:31:07,355 --> 00:31:14,735
Thanks. Hi, I'm Caitlin.

288
00:31:14,795 --> 00:31:17,855
Okay. I would say just like, one reason that, um,

289
00:31:18,005 --> 00:31:24,785
women may not be taken as seriously is because we're definitely more underrepresented in a lot of professional settings and just in general.

290
00:31:24,995 --> 00:31:32,295
Like other people have touched on, the more like societal role we play is kind of like being almost like a home keeper,

291
00:31:32,315 --> 00:31:37,444
things like that, which is like still respectful and it just kind of almost shapes this idea.

292
00:31:37,445 --> 00:31:43,235
So that way in more career settings, maybe we're not taken as seriously, especially.

293
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:51,635
Or if like we're looking at our health, people wouldn't really consider us as much as those that we see more apparent like in our day to day, I guess.

294
00:31:51,815 --> 00:31:59,585
Okay. So there's just something in terms of how we think about roles that is kind of baked into society,

295
00:31:59,585 --> 00:32:03,485
that lets people see women in a in a different way, is what you're suggesting.

296
00:32:03,515 --> 00:32:03,815
Right.

297
00:32:03,845 --> 00:32:11,674
Like we always stereotyped as being more emotional in that sense and not taking a serious look a lot in like, leadership roles and things like that.

298
00:32:11,675 --> 00:32:16,055
Okay. Okay, good. We're going to pause here and keep it moving.

299
00:32:16,505 --> 00:32:25,085
I'm going to keep sort of asking you to think about this question, because I would argue that, ah, building on the comment that was just made,

300
00:32:25,085 --> 00:32:34,264
that there's something larger operating here in terms of why we don't take women seriously in terms of some of these other disparities we see.

301
00:32:34,265 --> 00:32:38,375
So I'm going to keep asking you what you think that might might be as we go over the next couple of weeks.

302
00:32:39,275 --> 00:32:49,415
Interestingly here, same thing alluding to some things Alex was talking about widening socio economic disparities, um, also in class levels.

303
00:32:49,415 --> 00:32:56,075
So people who have a college degree obviously doing better than folks who don't.

304
00:32:56,435 --> 00:33:06,395
But notice that for women the benefit is 10 to 12 years longer for women who have a college degree compared to women who don't.

305
00:33:07,385 --> 00:33:16,055
The benefit for men, however, seems to be greater 12 to 16 years longer than men who don't have a college degree.

306
00:33:16,055 --> 00:33:22,325
And so my rhetorical question for now to you again is why why isn't it equal?

307
00:33:22,325 --> 00:33:28,835
Why doesn't having education confer the same benefits for women as it does for men?

308
00:33:30,585 --> 00:33:33,635
Okay. Next, two sides. Our review.

309
00:33:34,005 --> 00:33:41,695
We saw these. I'm going to just move through these quickly. This is a new picture from the readings you have for today.

310
00:33:42,565 --> 00:33:47,365
A graphic representation of social determinants of mental health.

311
00:33:47,935 --> 00:33:51,955
It's taken from the reading. So notice here.

312
00:33:52,075 --> 00:33:56,335
This kind of helps us to think a little bit more about root causes.

313
00:33:57,355 --> 00:34:04,525
Notice that distribution of opportunity is at the root of all of the social determinants of health.

314
00:34:04,535 --> 00:34:11,625
So the things that are listed on the previous slide and the things we think of as social determinants of health are not where it starts.

315
00:34:11,635 --> 00:34:14,725
There are things that undergird those things.

316
00:34:14,725 --> 00:34:22,075
And so if we want to think about interventions and policies and ways to change social determinants of health and structure,

317
00:34:22,075 --> 00:34:25,405
we've got to get at the root cause here.

318
00:34:25,475 --> 00:34:30,925
Okay. Some of you and your journal entries as you go through public health are often thinking like, why hasn't anything changed?

319
00:34:31,285 --> 00:34:35,275
Why do we keep seeing the same patterns or trends over time?

320
00:34:35,915 --> 00:34:38,635
My argument, maybe yours and others,

321
00:34:39,025 --> 00:34:48,535
is that we're not really getting at or changing what underlies the reasons for some of the things that we call social determinants of health.

322
00:34:48,545 --> 00:34:56,095
So I always find it interesting that we think of social determinants of health as the causes of the causes or the root causes.

323
00:34:56,725 --> 00:35:02,964
But I would argue that actually there's a whole nother level that's important to consider,

324
00:35:02,965 --> 00:35:08,185
and that may be even though we think of social determinants of health as the fundamental causes,

325
00:35:08,845 --> 00:35:13,225
that they're not actually the fundamental causes, there's something larger operating.

326
00:35:13,555 --> 00:35:17,335
And we'll be talking about what some of those things are over the next couple of weeks.

327
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:29,704
Okay. I heard a little bit and some of the responses in the last interaction where people are talking about the pathways,

328
00:35:29,705 --> 00:35:38,045
how do we get from being a woman or being LGBT identified and using more substances?

329
00:35:38,405 --> 00:35:39,835
Sort of connecting the dots.

330
00:35:39,845 --> 00:35:50,765
Well, maybe if I don't have access to work or the economic conditions that may relate to sort of feelings of productivity, mental health.

331
00:35:51,425 --> 00:35:55,775
Some of you talked about social factors, isolation, etc.

332
00:35:57,215 --> 00:36:00,525
So we know that pathways and mechanisms are important.

333
00:36:00,545 --> 00:36:08,315
And so I had this slide on Monday, but we didn't get to it in the last, I would say 20 to 30 years.

334
00:36:08,825 --> 00:36:16,085
There's been a lot of emphasis on thinking about how the biology is related to some of the social factors.

335
00:36:17,075 --> 00:36:25,925
A major mediating pathway or pathway that explains these disparities is thought to be biological.

336
00:36:26,065 --> 00:36:39,935
Okay. So the idea that when individuals experience stress that contributes to an activated fight or flight or sympathetic nervous system response,

337
00:36:40,205 --> 00:36:49,864
the heart rate kind of speeds up. There are more chemicals, stress, chemicals, cortisol are released into the blood and that over time,

338
00:36:49,865 --> 00:36:57,365
this constant sort of activation of the body leads to poorer health outcomes over time.

339
00:36:57,605 --> 00:37:04,715
Okay, so you're not going to be tested on the access or the pathway,

340
00:37:04,715 --> 00:37:09,635
but chemicals that are released, but something's going on in the brain when they're stress.

341
00:37:10,535 --> 00:37:21,685
Hypothalamus pituitary gland are releasing chemicals and the idea going down to at four is that there's a damage that results this out,

342
00:37:21,725 --> 00:37:25,954
a static load from the stress reactivity.

343
00:37:25,955 --> 00:37:31,385
So every time the body kind of has the stress response, the chemicals get released.

344
00:37:31,805 --> 00:37:38,195
That's somewhat normal. But over time, if it happens too much, the regulatory system breaks down.

345
00:37:38,735 --> 00:37:48,425
And so one of the key arguments is that when we have stress continually, the biological systems break down.

346
00:37:49,385 --> 00:37:59,225
There have been a number of studies kind of looking at blood clotting, blood actually becoming more viscous in response to stress over time.

347
00:37:59,255 --> 00:38:04,385
So that's related to pathway sclerosis and other types of cardiovascular disease.

348
00:38:05,345 --> 00:38:10,025
There have been tons of studies also showing that the more stress people experience,

349
00:38:10,355 --> 00:38:17,795
the more susceptible they are to inflammation, infection, their immune system not functioning the way that it should.

350
00:38:18,845 --> 00:38:26,105
And so when we're thinking about social context and how we get to disease,

351
00:38:26,585 --> 00:38:33,034
it's important to understand the steps in which this happens so that we can think about

352
00:38:33,035 --> 00:38:38,375
how do we what levels and different points of the sort of pathway can we intervene.

353
00:38:38,785 --> 00:38:44,315
Okay. Some really interesting work looking at what we call bio psycho social processes,

354
00:38:44,315 --> 00:38:49,625
so tying together the biology with the psychology and the social context.

355
00:38:50,205 --> 00:38:54,575
And there have been studies showing that when individuals have work,

356
00:38:55,115 --> 00:39:01,175
we'll talk about this in a couple of weeks where they don't have a lot of control over what they are doing,

357
00:39:01,925 --> 00:39:12,305
if there's a lack of variety in the work and that's actually been related to higher blood glucose levels, which has implications for diabetes.

358
00:39:12,335 --> 00:39:16,595
Okay. So it used to be that, you know, we kind of say, oh, you know,

359
00:39:17,315 --> 00:39:21,455
we know that the social context is related to health, but we don't really understand how.

360
00:39:21,875 --> 00:39:26,415
And this begins to give you a picture of some of the ways in which that occurs.

361
00:39:26,435 --> 00:39:33,815
Okay. So it's not just fight or fight, but immune systems breaking down ability to regulate glucose, blood glucose.

362
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:38,285
And over time, that leads to further health disparities.

363
00:39:40,395 --> 00:39:49,735
Okay. One interesting note that I wasn't planning to mention, but I'll just add it here because it comes to mind.

364
00:39:51,875 --> 00:40:00,245
When we think about health disparities, one thing that's really interesting is that when we talk about physical disparities.

365
00:40:01,185 --> 00:40:08,235
We see African-Americans and other groups have shorter life expectancy.

366
00:40:08,235 --> 00:40:11,685
Don't live as long. More cardiovascular disease, etc.

367
00:40:12,645 --> 00:40:18,985
When we look at mental health, on the other hand. We don't see those same disparities.

368
00:40:19,255 --> 00:40:24,735
In fact, for many, though, not all types of mental illness or psychopathology,

369
00:40:26,905 --> 00:40:36,445
people of color, African-Americans have more favorable or comparable mental health to whites.

370
00:40:37,015 --> 00:40:46,885
And so I thought question for you is, why is it the case that there would be a discrepancy in physical health?

371
00:40:47,755 --> 00:40:51,535
But we don't always see that in mental health.

372
00:40:51,685 --> 00:40:57,955
Okay. We'll take one comment here. I was think of it more rhetorical, but I'm glad someone wants to comment on this.

373
00:41:05,275 --> 00:41:09,995
Um. So name, please? Donny. There are a couple of things that go into this.

374
00:41:10,015 --> 00:41:14,665
One could be stigmas within those those groups of people, maybe a group,

375
00:41:14,665 --> 00:41:17,665
a cultural background, so that they don't feel comfortable to talk about mental health.

376
00:41:18,295 --> 00:41:22,795
Second, it could also be underreporting because of those stigmas, so there's less likely to be data about it.

377
00:41:23,275 --> 00:41:31,854
And third, I learned more of my classes from last semester that a lot of next people, as well as people from African American groups,

378
00:41:31,855 --> 00:41:37,375
also tend to have better social connections within their own families and friendships compared to white Americans.

379
00:41:37,555 --> 00:41:46,944
So that could also be another reason. Okay. So one of the mechanisms I asked you to think about is why is it that for Hispanic Americans,

380
00:41:46,945 --> 00:41:53,905
according to the data, they have longer life expectancy, even though we see more disabilities later on?

381
00:41:54,835 --> 00:42:00,024
One of the arguments is exactly what Dani has said, and that is that social supports,

382
00:42:00,025 --> 00:42:09,445
ethnic enclaves may actually confer some type of benefit that allows people to experience longer life.

383
00:42:09,625 --> 00:42:17,725
Okay. You also kind of talked about stigma and discrimination as contributing.

384
00:42:18,715 --> 00:42:27,235
So I guess in terms of thinking about why physical disparities but not mental health and social support

385
00:42:27,235 --> 00:42:31,705
could be one thing that kind of offsets that for mental health is what I think you're arguing.

386
00:42:33,175 --> 00:42:43,345
Let me extend that and say that some people have argued that one of the reasons you see this discrepancy is that this is a theory.

387
00:42:43,345 --> 00:42:48,955
It's not proven. African-Americans, when they experience stress,

388
00:42:48,955 --> 00:43:02,785
may engage in substance use and they may eat foods that make them feel really good and that release endorphins into the blood and that in the moment,

389
00:43:03,385 --> 00:43:07,155
that kind of reduces their overall psychological distress.

390
00:43:08,425 --> 00:43:19,075
But over time, if I'm eating a lot of fatty foods, if I'm using substances for long periods of time, it might help me in the moment.

391
00:43:19,075 --> 00:43:25,495
It might help me feel good and might help me cool out in the moment, but it might lead to long term health outcomes.

392
00:43:25,495 --> 00:43:33,025
And so some people have argued, again, it's a theory that there is this discrepancy between the physical and the mental health,

393
00:43:33,655 --> 00:43:39,505
because the things that protect your mental health actually are not good for your physical health.

394
00:43:39,835 --> 00:43:43,704
Okay. Um, you can see what you think about it.

395
00:43:43,705 --> 00:43:53,425
Maybe you'll write about it in your journal entry. This is a model advanced by a well-known late psychologist by the name of James Jackson,

396
00:43:54,385 --> 00:43:59,515
who was a faculty member at University of Michigan for a very long time before he passed.

397
00:44:00,505 --> 00:44:03,765
And the name of the theory is the affordances model.

398
00:44:03,775 --> 00:44:09,235
So if you're interested in reading more about the affordances model, you can take a look at that.

399
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:12,515
Okay. Thanks for engaging around that.

400
00:44:12,535 --> 00:44:21,475
So here's just a picture from a textbook I used to use in this class showing that all of these factors are interconnected.

401
00:44:22,315 --> 00:44:28,515
We've got the social structure, but it's impacting things at the level of the brain axis.

402
00:44:29,335 --> 00:44:36,685
It has implications for how your organs are functioning and that it leads to well-being, morbidity and mortality.

403
00:44:37,375 --> 00:44:42,895
We think about this at the population level. Psychologists think of it as an individual level.

404
00:44:43,255 --> 00:44:49,015
You've got all these other factors early life, individual genes, individual culture.

405
00:44:49,405 --> 00:44:57,475
So this is a complex system of factors. It's not just the social factors that explain how we get from point A to point B.

406
00:44:59,415 --> 00:45:03,455
We'll be coming back to this over the course of the semester. Okay.

407
00:45:03,465 --> 00:45:09,915
I want to do one more thing before our group exercise, and that's talk about equality versus equity.

408
00:45:10,835 --> 00:45:17,265
I ask you to watch the four minute review slide, which or video which should have been a review.

409
00:45:19,755 --> 00:45:23,735
I want to think a little bit more critically about this. Perhaps you all have already.

410
00:45:23,805 --> 00:45:30,555
Actually, I'll just ask right away. When you look at this image of equality versus equity,

411
00:45:30,555 --> 00:45:41,715
which for a long time was the kind of way of noting that even if you give everyone the same thing, it's still problematic.

412
00:45:43,215 --> 00:45:48,075
Many have suggested that this image is problematic for a number of reasons.

413
00:45:49,725 --> 00:45:53,535
Anyone familiar with those arguments or can you explain what's wrong with the picture?

414
00:45:53,895 --> 00:45:57,344
We have a couple of people in the front here. Sorry, I forgot.

415
00:45:57,345 --> 00:46:00,495
I have a mic. Oh.

416
00:46:01,315 --> 00:46:05,235
Hi. I'm Abby. Why? I don't know the arguments.

417
00:46:05,285 --> 00:46:08,694
I guess, like a first impression or whatever.

418
00:46:08,695 --> 00:46:16,075
Um, I notice, like, all the people here are appear to be male, and they all appear to be people of color.

419
00:46:16,075 --> 00:46:23,095
So I guess my question is, why is there the fence in the first place and why don't they get to be inside the stadium?

420
00:46:23,305 --> 00:46:27,015
Okay. Number of great observations right off the bat.

421
00:46:27,025 --> 00:46:30,715
All male in this image. Why aren't they in the stadium?

422
00:46:31,465 --> 00:46:34,465
Good. Thank you. Would you add to that others?

423
00:46:34,795 --> 00:46:39,805
I was just going to make a pretty similar argument. I've had discussions in different classes about this image before,

424
00:46:40,195 --> 00:46:43,165
and a lot of what we talk about is why is there even a wall there in the first place?

425
00:46:43,165 --> 00:46:47,305
Like, why not put a fence that everybody can see through or, you know, let them inside the stadium?

426
00:46:47,815 --> 00:46:53,245
And I think in real life that applies to like, you're giving these people the resources they need to overcome barriers,

427
00:46:53,245 --> 00:46:55,485
but why aren't we taking the barrier away in the first? Okay.

428
00:46:55,525 --> 00:47:00,675
So the removal of the barrier is an issue that some would say needs to be addressed in the picture.

429
00:47:00,685 --> 00:47:04,315
Okay. Being inside the park, the barrier disappearing.

430
00:47:04,705 --> 00:47:08,425
Okay. I see a couple of more hands. Let's thank you.

431
00:47:09,085 --> 00:47:12,655
I think we're going to start. Go ahead, please. Hi, my name is Ashley.

432
00:47:12,925 --> 00:47:19,645
And I think echoing what other people have said, it's kind of the same thing of like the barrier being there in the first place.

433
00:47:19,975 --> 00:47:26,184
So instead of like taking an equity approach more of like a justice approach where you eliminate

434
00:47:26,185 --> 00:47:35,875
those systemic barriers so people don't have to be given more just to be on the same playing field.

435
00:47:36,475 --> 00:47:38,094
Okay. Thank you, Ashley.

436
00:47:38,095 --> 00:47:48,685
So justice, we've seen a couple of graphic representations that have kind of add another panel and have justice added and leveling the playing field,

437
00:47:48,685 --> 00:47:52,495
as Ashley has suggested. I'll say more about that in a second. Let me take one or two more.

438
00:47:52,495 --> 00:48:02,005
Yes, please. Hi, I'm Kelly. I kind of interpreted how like, even with the, like, added like resources, like, like in the second image,

439
00:48:02,245 --> 00:48:08,094
like their representation of equity, all the people they're just allowed to see over the barrier.

440
00:48:08,095 --> 00:48:12,865
So it's kind of like they still have the bare minimum. Like they're not really like the barrier.

441
00:48:12,865 --> 00:48:21,805
So they're, they're not really involved like inside the stadium. So it kind of makes a comment on how even in our interpretation of equity,

442
00:48:21,805 --> 00:48:28,375
it might just be the bare minimum in terms of resources or whatever that's being given to these people.

443
00:48:28,645 --> 00:48:31,945
Okay. Thank you for that. I don't think I caught your name. Kaylee.

444
00:48:32,215 --> 00:48:35,545
Kaylee. Okay. I'm sorry. I forgot. I gave you the microphone.

445
00:48:35,905 --> 00:48:39,955
I'm Hannah Beer. This is a little different from what everyone else has been saying.

446
00:48:39,975 --> 00:48:44,634
Great. Kind of what I thought of when I first saw this was that like,

447
00:48:44,635 --> 00:48:50,665
it kind of only assumes there's one issue there, whereas, like, there might be a couple more.

448
00:48:50,665 --> 00:48:53,425
Like one of them might be nearsighted, so they might need like.

449
00:48:54,395 --> 00:49:00,935
Something other than that to be able to see the baseball game or like one of them might not be able to stand for a very long time.

450
00:49:01,925 --> 00:49:07,835
So it kind of assumes there's only one barrier where there might be a couple that we're not considering.

451
00:49:08,075 --> 00:49:11,075
Okay. Thank you for that, Hannah. So there may be barriers.

452
00:49:11,075 --> 00:49:20,195
Barriers might be an oversimplification of it. Maybe there are things we can't see that people are experiencing vision that are important to consider.

453
00:49:20,555 --> 00:49:25,405
Okay. Let me take one more. I think there were a couple of hands here and then I do have to move on.

454
00:49:28,165 --> 00:49:35,395
One common criticism I hear about this graphic is the fact that for the equality, pain, they're all starting on the same level.

455
00:49:35,875 --> 00:49:42,895
Whereas in the US specifically, different groups are not starting at the same level because of policies by the

456
00:49:42,895 --> 00:49:46,495
government that have been used to take resources from different communities.

457
00:49:47,585 --> 00:49:51,174
Okay. And would you like to add a quick comment since you were waiting? Yeah.

458
00:49:51,175 --> 00:49:55,735
Sorry. My name name's Serena. And this is a little off topic, I guess.

459
00:49:55,735 --> 00:50:00,025
I really liked the analogy they used in the video of bicycles instead.

460
00:50:01,165 --> 00:50:10,675
I hear some. Sometimes when I talk about this, people talk about how this picture specifically can also be a little bit ablest.

461
00:50:11,335 --> 00:50:17,934
And I really liked the bicycle analogy because it kind of talks about how each solution is going to be

462
00:50:17,935 --> 00:50:24,115
individualized in that each person that is in that kind of picture or a video or whatever you want to call it,

463
00:50:24,385 --> 00:50:30,475
is facing a very different and unique problem because of intersectionality, kind of like what we've been talking about.

464
00:50:30,955 --> 00:50:37,795
Okay, great. These are excellent thoughts about critiques to this image.

465
00:50:38,425 --> 00:50:48,205
And you all have identified some new ones that I haven't seen and thinking or that I haven't seen written up extensively.

466
00:50:48,205 --> 00:50:52,075
So think about being in or out of the stadium, for example.

467
00:50:52,435 --> 00:50:56,545
And I like the idea in terms of the invisible versus invisible.

468
00:50:56,725 --> 00:50:59,095
Okay. I want to show you a couple.

469
00:50:59,695 --> 00:51:06,504
And obviously I didn't include this slide because I wanted you to think about this a little bit more, but I'll edit in after class.

470
00:51:06,505 --> 00:51:12,355
So here's kind of an extension of this point.

471
00:51:12,355 --> 00:51:23,424
So we call the equity we know a reality. Speaking to a point Ashlee and others have made is that the ground is not equal for everyone.

472
00:51:23,425 --> 00:51:30,775
Okay, so someone called that panel reality, okay? Someone talked about liberation and removing of the barriers.

473
00:51:30,775 --> 00:51:43,014
So that's one image to more that folks have sort of extended is this idea that the the soil is not equal.

474
00:51:43,015 --> 00:51:47,185
Okay. So people aren't on a level playing field in the first place.

475
00:51:47,185 --> 00:51:50,665
Okay. So this is the equity idea. You see the ground is sloping.

476
00:51:51,445 --> 00:51:54,655
These folks all have the same image or same box.

477
00:51:54,655 --> 00:51:58,675
But notice the fences going up. It still doesn't help.

478
00:51:59,815 --> 00:52:06,985
Another thing I forgot to mention to you, another critique that actually didn't come up in the conversation but is related to thinking

479
00:52:06,985 --> 00:52:13,615
about ableism is not just that there are men or boys in this particular depiction,

480
00:52:14,005 --> 00:52:19,915
but some people have noted not only that they are people of color, but there's almost the supposition.

481
00:52:19,915 --> 00:52:28,554
Notice the person who needs the extra trait is a different size or is smaller than the other people in the image.

482
00:52:28,555 --> 00:52:32,875
And so some of the more recent images have said, you know,

483
00:52:32,905 --> 00:52:41,095
this is problematic because it's suggesting that people of color are are from the beginning less than or not the same as they're different.

484
00:52:41,815 --> 00:52:48,565
And so there have been attempts to not only, you know, sort of allude to this sloping sand,

485
00:52:48,565 --> 00:52:58,764
but to keep the people all of the same image like you'll see in one more image here, equality, equity, justice.

486
00:52:58,765 --> 00:53:06,445
Again, this idea of a slope that there are different you know, people are starting off in different places.

487
00:53:06,895 --> 00:53:09,325
And this one uses the fence again as a barrier.

488
00:53:09,325 --> 00:53:21,684
But you'll notice in the justice panel, it looks like maybe there's a water or the barrier is gone and the folks are all able to see the sunset.

489
00:53:21,685 --> 00:53:25,165
But there's this recognition that, again, the slope is uneven.

490
00:53:25,435 --> 00:53:36,205
Okay. So again, I want you to think about this is something people often tackle in their glossary assignment, also in their journals.

491
00:53:36,205 --> 00:53:40,735
Some of you may think about ways you would rework these images,

492
00:53:41,035 --> 00:53:46,345
adding in some of the things that we talked about, you may think there's a better way to depict it.

493
00:53:47,065 --> 00:53:55,195
I want to encourage you to, you know, sort of further your thinking about all of the things that we just mentioned and talk to spoke about.

494
00:53:55,405 --> 00:54:00,255
Okay. Great discussion there. Okay.

495
00:54:01,745 --> 00:54:06,905
All right. So, all right, what we're going to do, this happens every year.

496
00:54:09,035 --> 00:54:12,514
I have an exercise plan. We're going to use the rest of the class period for it.

497
00:54:12,515 --> 00:54:15,725
We've got about 25 minutes.

498
00:54:16,715 --> 00:54:23,105
Usually my hope is that we will reconvene as a large group, but we're not going to be able to do that so well.

499
00:54:23,615 --> 00:54:27,605
We're actually going to start with discussing this exercise on Wednesday.

500
00:54:28,685 --> 00:54:38,795
And here's the task. Okay. I want you to between now and next Wednesday, think about models of social determinants of health.

501
00:54:39,005 --> 00:54:47,765
Okay? In your project groups, I should say you are not you you are going to work together.

502
00:54:47,765 --> 00:54:50,225
So I'll tell you how we're going to do that in a second.

503
00:54:50,885 --> 00:55:01,204
I want you to use the in-class readings which are on canvas based on which group you're assigned to.

504
00:55:01,205 --> 00:55:11,045
So we're going to have three periods here before 1995, 1995 to 2005 and 2005 and after.

505
00:55:11,045 --> 00:55:20,315
Okay. So under each of those categories on canvas, you're going to see readings that have a model of social determinants of health.

506
00:55:20,405 --> 00:55:28,475
Okay? If you look at the title on canvas, it will tell you the page number where you can find the model.

507
00:55:28,565 --> 00:55:34,204
Okay, what I want you to do, there are three what I call harvest documents.

508
00:55:34,205 --> 00:55:38,765
These are places we're going to take notes and then we're going to share it with the entire class.

509
00:55:40,265 --> 00:55:43,685
I'm not mountains, so this probably may not work.

510
00:55:43,955 --> 00:55:47,075
Let's see. Oh, it did work today.

511
00:55:47,105 --> 00:55:52,535
Okay, so this is a series of questions.

512
00:55:53,285 --> 00:55:57,125
I want you to look at the models in your period.

513
00:55:57,545 --> 00:56:00,065
So if your before 1995,

514
00:56:00,545 --> 00:56:09,335
I want you to look at the models and identify what are the similarities and differences that you see across the models within that period.

515
00:56:09,785 --> 00:56:11,345
Okay. So that's question one.

516
00:56:12,455 --> 00:56:25,205
The second question is, if you have time and this you may not, how do the models in your period differ from the models in the other periods?

517
00:56:25,325 --> 00:56:31,985
Okay. That may be one you want to save until, uh, after class or something.

518
00:56:33,305 --> 00:56:41,105
The third question is what's missing? When you look at the models in your period, what do you think are some limitations?

519
00:56:41,675 --> 00:56:48,515
If we want to understand what population health is, what do you think is missing from the models in your period?

520
00:56:49,685 --> 00:56:51,725
And then we're not going to have time to do this.

521
00:56:51,905 --> 00:56:58,625
But in some years when we were remote, we would use a whiteboard and we'd actually draw kind of revised models.

522
00:56:58,805 --> 00:57:11,854
Okay. And this question just f why I usually shows up in some form on the midterm exam in terms of thinking about differences across the models,

523
00:57:11,855 --> 00:57:15,575
similarities, differences. So I encourage you to to take it seriously.

524
00:57:17,285 --> 00:57:21,754
You will cut and paste the little blurb here as many times.

525
00:57:21,755 --> 00:57:25,295
So by the time we're done, there'll be like five of these.

526
00:57:25,295 --> 00:57:30,934
And sometimes Google Docs goes crazy and starts adding like five, six, seven, eight, 15, 16.

527
00:57:30,935 --> 00:57:38,915
So just ignore that. But answer the questions for your group in the Google doc, pay for your class period.

528
00:57:40,625 --> 00:57:42,575
Okay. A couple more things before we break.

529
00:57:43,625 --> 00:57:56,045
So the way that we're going to do this is groups one through five are going to do before 95, groups six through 1495 for 2005 and so on.

530
00:57:56,175 --> 00:58:05,435
Okay. What I propose so that we don't have total chaos, is this side of the room will be groups one through five.

531
00:58:05,495 --> 00:58:13,804
So start one back to five. Just gather in your small groups and the middle section will be 6 to 14.

532
00:58:13,805 --> 00:58:16,925
So maybe we can do six and seven in the front.

533
00:58:17,075 --> 00:58:26,555
Eight and nine, so on and so forth. And then similarly, for 15 to 19, let's meet on this side with 15 in the front to the back.

534
00:58:26,815 --> 00:58:32,315
Okay. If you do not know, can I ask folks to hold on?

535
00:58:32,915 --> 00:58:38,375
Hold on. While I finish the instructions, please, if I can get everyone's attention.

536
00:58:38,525 --> 00:58:47,125
We have a question from a peer. I just want one of the links for groups 15 through 19 isn't working is the one for the World Health Organization.

537
00:58:47,135 --> 00:58:51,515
It says the page cannot be found. Okay. I just want you to know that into that.

538
00:58:52,505 --> 00:58:57,425
And maybe once we start, I'll leave out the questions for the other groups so you can see.

539
00:58:58,205 --> 00:59:08,465
Okay, some of you, the one last thing I want to mention is where you can find your group number.

540
00:59:08,465 --> 00:59:12,995
If you don't already know it, you should know it's under people.

541
00:59:13,775 --> 00:59:17,245
Group Journal, our final project. These are all the groups.

542
00:59:17,255 --> 00:59:25,845
Okay, so you can probably see it when you responded to your journal and that's the task.

543
00:59:25,845 --> 00:59:29,015
Okay. We will not reconvene. You've got about 20 minutes.

544
00:59:29,555 --> 00:59:39,485
Enter your notes on the Google doc. When we start next Wednesday, I'm going to ask you to report out on what you discussed in the exercise today.

545
00:59:40,535 --> 00:59:44,805
Okay. Are there any questions? Okay, go ahead.

546
00:59:44,825 --> 00:59:54,745
One through five. The challenge.

547
01:00:06,455 --> 01:00:13,835
Okay. Group one will be here. Group two, three, etc.

548
01:00:21,775 --> 01:00:34,705
I'll tell you, I. Okay.

549
01:00:34,705 --> 01:00:38,665
We've got some group. Seven's here somewhere in the front.

550
01:00:38,755 --> 01:00:42,745
I don't know where Group Six is. You're seven.

551
01:00:42,805 --> 01:00:45,805
Okay. Group seven, I think.

552
01:00:46,615 --> 01:00:51,355
Okay. Yeah. That's what I said originally. This is six.

553
01:01:07,515 --> 01:01:12,955
If you don't already know, these are the folks that you will be working with for the rest of the semester.

554
01:01:12,955 --> 01:01:20,585
So make sure you introduce yourself. All right.

555
01:01:25,155 --> 01:01:28,785
Group 12 any other 12 right here.

556
01:01:32,595 --> 01:01:40,515
Group 15, where are you? If you need help finding your group.

557
01:01:41,715 --> 01:01:51,645
Group 17. Where are you? 17. Group 14, whereas group 14.

558
01:01:57,335 --> 01:02:07,145
All right. Who else needs help finding their group? Yeah.

559
01:02:15,945 --> 01:02:20,475
Your phone. I don't know who that is. Oh, Kelly. Someone's missing a phone.

560
01:02:20,865 --> 01:02:23,985
Kelly? Oh, no. Kelly. Yeah. Yeah. Kelly.

561
01:02:24,645 --> 01:02:29,445
Kelly? Kelly. Are you missing a phone? Yeah.

562
01:02:32,835 --> 01:02:42,425
Your. Oh, well, and that's what you're to do.

563
01:02:43,355 --> 01:02:47,315
Okay. Group five, if there are any more folks. Your group is up here.

564
01:02:50,525 --> 01:02:59,375
One other thing I forgot to mention is that the models do appear on the slides after this, if you want.

565
01:03:01,805 --> 01:03:12,125
They're a little harder to read, but the slides have pre 95, 95, two, 25 and 25 forward.

566
01:03:12,495 --> 01:03:18,755
Right. But if you want to read the fine print, you can do that through canvas.

567
01:03:19,355 --> 01:03:31,915
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Very like.

568
01:03:35,855 --> 01:03:44,445
Yeah. Ow!

569
01:03:45,305 --> 01:03:53,305
Ow! Ow, ow, ow.

570
01:03:59,665 --> 01:04:05,795
Sorry. It's.

571
01:04:13,765 --> 01:04:17,455
I'm going to try and fix which one of the links was it?

572
01:04:17,455 --> 01:04:22,975
Was it to the 2005 forward that was broken? Okay.

573
01:04:36,795 --> 01:05:07,335
Oh, yes. Well, you know.

574
01:05:12,375 --> 01:05:32,805
Yeah, I think. It's so strange.

575
01:05:33,015 --> 01:05:39,625
There are people in, I guess, 95 forward, so people must be accessing it in different ways.

576
01:05:39,645 --> 01:05:47,115
I'm not sure because when I look at 2005, after 2005, there are clearly people in there.

577
01:05:48,915 --> 01:05:59,095
But for some reason I felt like that was.

578
01:06:12,165 --> 01:06:19,465
Yes. Okay. Why? Everyone.

579
01:06:25,295 --> 01:06:32,875
Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. So.

580
01:06:35,765 --> 01:06:42,955
So. What happened?

581
01:07:04,975 --> 01:07:11,175
Yeah. I think that's important for us.

582
01:07:14,265 --> 01:07:22,085
Body. Sorry.

583
01:07:22,415 --> 01:07:37,225
What are you. Yeah.

584
01:07:57,685 --> 01:08:24,675
I have. People.

585
01:08:26,695 --> 01:08:44,105
So. I about.

586
01:08:57,795 --> 01:09:23,275
My. Tomorrow night.

587
01:09:32,075 --> 01:09:40,865
Yeah. Yeah.

588
01:10:05,215 --> 01:10:09,025
Okay. So 2005 plus.

589
01:10:10,085 --> 01:10:20,005
Here's what we did. If you click on this, at least here, it'll take you to the Web page and then you can download the paper right there.

590
01:10:22,165 --> 01:10:28,415
Okay. So, again, just not this part over here, but solar.

591
01:10:28,415 --> 01:10:34,365
Erwin. I don't know.

592
01:10:41,625 --> 01:10:44,865
Yes. You really got to go.

593
01:10:45,285 --> 01:11:00,875
She got a love of work. Oh.

594
01:11:08,705 --> 01:11:12,185
Oh, yes, I guess.

595
01:11:17,455 --> 01:11:30,415
I spoke. Hi.

596
01:11:40,115 --> 01:11:44,285
This line presented.

597
01:11:59,325 --> 01:12:16,885
Okay. Out.

598
01:12:30,275 --> 01:12:41,135
In the next. It's just that it's.

599
01:12:51,075 --> 01:13:05,525
Here. Down.

600
01:13:38,745 --> 01:14:01,115
Yeah. Yeah. They just.

601
01:14:05,045 --> 01:14:22,525
What's the change? I have a hard.

602
01:14:30,995 --> 01:14:56,525
I'm also. How does that work?

603
01:15:13,165 --> 01:15:21,905
I think. Yeah.

604
01:15:23,615 --> 01:15:40,155
Going to come? Hundred.

605
01:16:42,215 --> 01:16:54,255
I was like. You know.

606
01:17:12,995 --> 01:17:32,095
That's not. It leaves a lot.

607
01:17:38,395 --> 01:17:42,095
Oh. There is.

608
01:17:45,785 --> 01:17:59,845
He said. I've got.

609
01:18:04,965 --> 01:18:14,185
But except for people like. I my father.

610
01:19:13,275 --> 01:19:17,725
Yeah. I.

611
01:19:23,395 --> 01:19:23,635
Right.
