1
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:14,809
Okay. So we all go through question a2g and four question.

2
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:23,620
I want. Adults who nap regularly have lower blood pressure than adults who do not nap.

3
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:29,440
And the conclusion is there is a positive association between napping and blood pressure.

4
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:33,940
Whether it is true or false. Go ahead.

5
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:46,150
Yes. This is an inverse association, Poppy, because people who pay up because people who nap had lower blood pressure.

6
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:56,680
Actually, I'm not explaining I think because it kind of appears so for be influenza.

7
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:59,870
Ebola makes smokers become infected more than nonsmokers.

8
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:03,600
So there is an association between smoking and influenza.

9
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,590
It is true or false statement.

10
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:20,829
Yes. And foreseeing our influenza epidemic, smokers become infected less than nonsmokers.

11
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:25,400
So there is no association between smoking and influenza.

12
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:29,790
So. To all of us. Yes.

13
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:33,230
You guys did a great job. Yeah.

14
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:40,459
Influenza epidemic. For the influenza epidemic, there are fewer infections among vaccinated people.

15
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:47,990
The amount now vaccinated. Therefore, there is a positive association between vaccination and influenza.

16
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:53,980
True or false? Great question.

17
00:12:55,400 --> 00:13:00,770
60% of women who develop breast cancer have had fewer than three pregnancy.

18
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:06,680
So there is an inverse association between parity and breast cancer.

19
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:11,700
Two of us. Oh.

20
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:30,180
So. So for those who answer this question force, can you any volunteer want to give me some bland explanation regarding why you think that is false?

21
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:36,690
Yes, exactly. Actually, it is not fast.

22
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:43,590
It is fast. Not because it is not a slow associate is because it actually is not describing our association.

23
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:56,250
So for question F, these kind of disease and ear infection is more frequent in preschool age remaining school age children.

24
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:00,960
There is an inverse association between age and these disease.

25
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:04,560
Is true or false? Yes.

26
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:13,049
So full question G in a follow up study mentality was hiring people is very low or

27
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:18,840
very high body mass index lower and people always intermediate body mass index.

28
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:23,790
So there is no association between body mass index and mortality.

29
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:29,280
These true or false? So what?

30
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:35,380
What is the direction of the association between body mass index and mortality?

31
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:42,550
Yeah. I heard some of you said U-shape association.

32
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:48,250
Yeah, this is a very accurate description.

33
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:54,220
Um, so is there any caution for.

34
00:14:56,340 --> 00:15:00,090
A to G if you want me to explain further.

35
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:18,740
Okay. 4G. So for kids, exposure is body mass index which can be divided into three groups are low body mass,

36
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:25,189
low body mass index, intermediate body mass index and high body mass index.

37
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:29,620
Right. So this is a three level categorical exposure.

38
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:32,300
So the outcome was mortality.

39
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:46,520
And the promise that that mortality was higher in people is lower and higher body mass index, but lower in people with intermediate body mass index.

40
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:50,720
So if I were if there is an like.

41
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:56,880
Plotz You can say it will be. Like this.

42
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:05,460
So the x axis is BMI divided into three groups low.

43
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:14,530
Medium, intermediate and the high. And the outcome is mortality risk.

44
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:20,350
So for both low group and high group, the mortality risk is high.

45
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:31,840
This is like. This is. Kind of for these two group and for intermediate group, the mortality rate case lower.

46
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:35,480
So it's kind of like a U-shape association, right?

47
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:56,180
So any other questions? If not, we'll go through part two and part two is kind of maybe a little bit complicated.

48
00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:08,100
And I will only give you one minute to read the prompter and maybe think about the following questions a little bit.

49
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:11,780
Then we all go through all discussions all together.

50
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:09,060
So for the first question, the exposure and outcome.

51
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:23,870
So what is the exposure and what is outcome? Anyone want to try it or you can.

52
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:34,050
Sure. Your parents. Mm hmm.

53
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:44,620
Outcome is. Um, not really.

54
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:56,380
I think, I think I from the first paragraph that the underlying sentence that you are interested in determining a physical activity prevents,

55
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:06,700
uh, myopia in children. So actually this, this word for prevent stands for causal effects, right?

56
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:11,530
So exposure would be physical activity then outcome would be myopia.

57
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:23,180
Um, so for the second question, drawing a bag according to the problem.

58
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,740
So I will draw the deck together with you all.

59
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:37,840
So I read the prompts. So now we, we know that the exposure is physical activity.

60
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,090
So I will use P.A for short.

61
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:45,490
Okay. Okay. Physical activity. So outcome will be.

62
00:20:49,660 --> 00:21:08,379
My opia and the first down and sad having myopic parents is a causal risk factor for myopia, which means my o peak parents can cause myopia.

63
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:11,580
Right? And second stands.

64
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:15,010
Sad and sad. That bright light.

65
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:16,750
Cause. Cause.

66
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:33,760
Dopamine which are released in these cell and which inhibits eye growth which and appearances that which inhibits I growth means well cause myopia.

67
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:40,860
So from the second sentence we can draw that we know that there is a.

68
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:46,000
Variable called bright light.

69
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:54,060
And it will cause. The upcoming level, right.

70
00:21:54,750 --> 00:22:07,530
And this dopamine level will influence that raised of developing myopia and for the search sentences spanning time,

71
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:11,430
outdoor increases, exposure to bright light.

72
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:17,740
So we have another node. Which leads me.

73
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:33,780
We have another note which is time outdoors, right?

74
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:41,420
Well increases a person's exposure to a bright light.

75
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:53,960
And following on, we can see that this sad and sad baseline, there is another variable called baseline dopamine levels.

76
00:22:54,230 --> 00:23:06,770
And this and this baseline level will determine the individual's susceptibility to me, opiate, which means we can now have a variable called baseline.

77
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:19,389
Dopamine which will influence the race car developing outcome rate and next sentence

78
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:27,040
at these baseline level determine how much dopamine can be released in response to.

79
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:36,359
Stimulus, which means there is an arrow from baseline top having level to the upcoming level.

80
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:48,120
Right. And next sentence at baseline dopamine levels are determined in part by white main D levels.

81
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:54,870
So which means vitamin D levels can partly influence baseline the upcoming level, right.

82
00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:03,450
So we all have a white MIDI level influenced baseline,

83
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:13,860
the upcoming level and white Mindy is synthesized from the sunlight and it further explains that,

84
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:18,690
which means spanning time, outdoor increases, white main D level.

85
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:25,920
So outdoor activity spanning time, outdoor would increase our vitamin D level.

86
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:34,580
And then these and inside children who spend more time outdoor are more likely to be physical,

87
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:45,059
active things spanning time outdoor causes children to increase this their physical activity when you read

88
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:52,140
this sentence is that children who spend time more time outdoors are more likely to be physical activity,

89
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:57,480
which means there is an association between these variable time outdoor and physical activity.

90
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:05,760
Right. But actually you don't know whether it is like doing more physical activity cause people are more likely to spend time,

91
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:15,419
outdoor or the other way around. But the following sentence explains that spanning time, outdoor causes children to increase this physical activity.

92
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:26,399
So, you know, the direction of the arrow is from spanning time, outdoor caused causes physical increased level of physical activity.

93
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:35,610
Right. And next on is that last physical activity is causally related to development of obesity.

94
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:39,180
So which means this variable.

95
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:42,310
Well, cause. Obesity.

96
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:48,790
Right. And, um. And then he said, um.

97
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:56,370
White men. Mindy levels are in our decrease in obese children.

98
00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:01,800
So obesity would cause white widening D to decrease.

99
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:11,130
Right. And I think basically this is the bag we have.

100
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:18,900
So any questions regarding this stock?

101
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:51,340
Are you asking that in these from a like explains a positive association or inverse associations should we somehow brought that into this stag, right.

102
00:26:52,770 --> 00:27:00,690
I think currently we we actually we just draw the DAX without any indication of what

103
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:06,270
is the what is the direction of the association between two nodes or two variables.

104
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:22,630
Yeah. No problem. I thank you.

105
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:34,480
I think we need to split the dummy into two variables or two nodes because one is called baseline and y is just dopamine level,

106
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,809
which means their time component into these two variables.

107
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:40,840
So it's a different variable.

108
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:49,990
There are different variables. Yeah. I'd like to be.

109
00:27:52,300 --> 00:28:00,310
Uh, could there an association between White Mindy D and bright sunlight?

110
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:06,140
Right. Would that be. Uh.

111
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:11,579
You mean, like, do you want an arrow between these two variable?

112
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:16,210
And are you ready?

113
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:23,700
Uh. I don't know. Why? Why do we need to write a song like twice?

114
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:27,960
I think this is a song like. And this is times spanning outdoor I.

115
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:47,479
I think we only like when we draw back, we only draw the direct association between two Nazis.

116
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:53,129
So there is no further. Further inference.

117
00:28:53,130 --> 00:29:04,260
Like what? You sad because. Because one caused that and because a Cosby and because they so well draw an arrow between A and C,

118
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:11,040
if the prompt did not directly say sad that A would influence C, we will not draw an arrow between A and C.

119
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:19,460
Yeah, we did. We did not do further inference. Yeah. I feel like they're saying that I'm on the side.

120
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:34,280
Uh. Time.

121
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:47,600
Outdoor lightning and lightning dee is seen aside from sunlight.

122
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:05,970
Yeah, I think this is this is a little bit confusing.

123
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:19,830
Why mean these things aside from sunlight? Spanning time, outdoor increases, vitamin D level.

124
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:35,490
I actually I don't think these synthesized sheep signifies or represents direct association between sunlight exposure and vitamin D.

125
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:44,260
I think what we need to look for words like determine cause of ag to increase these kind of words.

126
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:57,100
And I think. Yeah, I think it is not very clear here about actually we don't think these kind of words like represent a causal association.

127
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:00,280
So that's why I don't have an arrow between these two.

128
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:07,990
Horrible. Okay. Any other questions regarding the deck?

129
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:15,230
Okay. I also want to mention.

130
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:26,400
Mm hmm. Mm hmm.

131
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:41,180
I think I think for the obesity thing, aides said very clearly because they use causal words like.

132
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:49,780
Like Vitamin D level, white levels are decreased in obese children.

133
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:57,100
So I think this decrease tells us that obesity could somehow influence vitamin D level.

134
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:18,380
So we'll go to question three, identify our possible paths from exposure to outcome and write out all the tests.

135
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:40,240
So. For this question to write out all the paths we need to remember.

136
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:44,710
We we need to write out not only the.

137
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:51,889
Open pass, but also the direct about also the closed pass.

138
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:55,850
Right. So basically we start from.

139
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:02,420
The first pass from our exposure of physical activity.

140
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:14,670
And they will it will determine. Physical activity is determined by spanning time.

141
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:28,430
Outdoor. And. Spending time outdoors in physical activities is determined by time outdoors

142
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:34,100
and time outdoors would increase or would influence bright light exposure,

143
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:46,970
and that it will then influence the whole performing level and then influence directly influence outcome myopia.

144
00:33:47,160 --> 00:34:08,770
Right. So the second sort of. So do you see the first pass I'm writing and the second pass will be steal time.

145
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:16,569
Although old influence, physical activity and time outdoor would influence bright light exposure.

146
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:22,910
Which influence? Stop harming release and then.

147
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:33,690
And then the upcoming level is influenced by baseline dopamine levels.

148
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:46,940
So that's why the direction is from baseline to baseline to having to dummy dopamine itself and then well goes through outcome meal.

149
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:54,940
PR So this. The second pass I'm writing.

150
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:04,900
So the third pass is still we can from.

151
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:17,129
Time outdoors, determining physical activity and and time and time outdoor would also determine white

152
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:27,500
main d level which influence baseline dopamine level and then directly influenced outcome.

153
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:33,530
Myopia. So the Senate passes like this.

154
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,830
Right. And the fourth pass is.

155
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:52,710
Still time, outdoor influence, physical activity level and time outdoor would influence vitamin D level and their influence.

156
00:35:53,580 --> 00:36:12,130
Baseline. Dopamine level and doud influence dopamine a itself so baseline dopamine level influenced Obama himself and that influence outcome.

157
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:19,210
So this pass from here to here and then to here and then to outcome.

158
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:26,930
So for. The fiefs pass.

159
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,770
The past we can go through.

160
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:50,330
Physical activity itself determines rates of developing obesity and then obesity status would influence white male level and then influence and.

161
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:59,939
And Vitamin D level is determined by time outdoors.

162
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:04,590
So the direction be like this time outdoor.

163
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:12,890
Influence Vitamin D level and time outdoor would further influence bright light exposure

164
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:23,090
and bright light exposure influence the PAMMY and then the PAMMY influence outcome myopia.

165
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:38,540
And then next pass is physical activity developed by determining by obesity and obesity influence vitamin D and white mean D still influenced by time.

166
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:42,260
Outdoor and then.

167
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:57,280
So sorry. And then time outdoor influence bright light exposure and bright light exposure influence.

168
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:08,439
The upcoming level and the priming level is determined by baseline, the opening level and the baseline.

169
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:14,230
The opening level would also influence thus this assess step two liability of outcome.

170
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:25,870
And so basically I think the fifth and the six passes like this physical activity,

171
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:37,000
obesity, vitamin D, vitamin D, outdoor activity, bright light and dopamine outcome.

172
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,300
And the Vive sees physical activity.

173
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:44,409
Obesity might mean the outdoor bright light baseline.

174
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:51,100
They'll pass me the dopamine baseline for me and I'll come and we still have to pass.

175
00:38:53,770 --> 00:39:00,770
So, um, so yeah, it's a lot.

176
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:10,580
So when you do our homework, you need to be careful, identify each pass.

177
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:22,870
So past PSG is now actually much simpler physical activity determining obesity and

178
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:34,370
obesity influence vitamin D and vitamin D influence base baseline doping level.

179
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:46,049
And then it influence the outcome. And that is physical activity influence obesity and obesity,

180
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:58,220
influence vitamin D and the mainly influence baseline dopamine level and baseline dopamine level influenced opening level, which implies outcome.

181
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:04,830
So basically we have I think we have how many pass?

182
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:13,070
Yeah. It's a pass in total and due to time limitation.

183
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:19,460
I will just ask you if you have any questions and will I will answer a question at the end.

184
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:32,809
Okay. So for the question for the first question asks you to identify past which there are which

185
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:38,420
there are shows and also which there shows no association between exposure and outcome.

186
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:42,800
So basically you will need to identify.

187
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:55,750
Like you apply the rules. You apply the rules, that you apply the rules to identify, association and pick one passwords?

188
00:40:55,770 --> 00:41:04,230
No association. So we so the rules of the association flow in that when it is a close pass.

189
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:15,790
There is no statistical association. Right. So basically the definition of a close pass is that you can find a collider along the pass.

190
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:25,350
Right. So what is a collider? So collider is like to two arrowheads point to the same variable, right?

191
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:32,160
So you start from all these paths, we can identify that.

192
00:41:36,690 --> 00:41:41,219
Maybe this one can identify that these past there is no.

193
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:45,120
Collider, right? These paths. Collider Right now.

194
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:50,059
Collider Right. This past, I think no.

195
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:53,450
Collider. These pass now. Collider.

196
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:56,830
These PIs, these pass collider. Vitamin D and the me.

197
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:01,579
Right? Yeah.

198
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:05,530
Oh, yeah. E pasty white mean B is a collider.

199
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:09,619
Right? And for next to pass, there is no collider.

200
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:14,779
Right. So so far, yeah.

201
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:25,280
So for, for, for a you actually need to identify, pass e and specify that because of ah which,

202
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:34,400
which had the collider or colliders along these pass and force for B and you need to

203
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:39,950
specify that pass where there is a statistical association between exposure and outcome,

204
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:41,600
but there is no causal association.

205
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:53,840
So applying the rules of association of causation which means well will need to first to identify pass well first need to identify open pass right.

206
00:42:54,020 --> 00:43:01,160
So along open pass. There is no collider and we can.

207
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:11,360
I think except this three parts b e f all other parts are all the parts, right?

208
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:23,540
Because there are no colliders. And then if we just want association by no causation, the past need also to be and direct path, right?

209
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:29,660
If it is a direct if the pass are directed directly to pass, which means there is causation.

210
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:45,140
So I think I think except past G and H, which are direct pass from from tale to had.

211
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:55,980
All along the pass. These are these two are direct pass so these to our associate our causation pass not association pass and for or other pass.

212
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:07,850
You can find. These are all like backdoor paths from running from tale to tell situation.

213
00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:23,700
Yes. And for for C actually I think I've already answered that actually for Fozzie,

214
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:33,650
we need to go first theories and first we need to identify association paths, right.

215
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:40,290
Because when there is as because the association exists is up for is requisite for causation.

216
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:54,360
And then when we apply the causation flow rules so we need to find out direct paths, which means all arrows from exposures are hard to tell.

217
00:44:54,360 --> 00:45:06,210
So these are the paths from past G and H for question five,

218
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:16,740
either in causal effect of physical activity myopia, if there is, it is through direct or indirect.

219
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:20,250
If that's any wall and here's.

220
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:41,180
Yes. Correct. According to the rules of causation, flow paths and association flow pass theories,

221
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:47,180
at least as long as there is at least one pass through which exposure and outcome are closely associated.

222
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:58,950
We say that there is causation overall, although like no association may also exist, or like association but not causation paths may also exist.

223
00:45:58,970 --> 00:46:09,320
But as long as we can find causation and pass, we say overall there is causation and these two are both indirect effects.

224
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:16,250
Causal effects, right? Because it is through multiple variables, rather that directly from exposure to outcome.

225
00:46:17,050 --> 00:46:29,300
And the for the last causation, write out the notation between exposure and outcome according to.

226
00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:37,120
For, according to each question, A, B and C in question four.

227
00:46:37,150 --> 00:46:44,560
So this will be a little bit complicated because notice that in this situation.

228
00:46:46,110 --> 00:47:03,290
The exposure is sad. The exposure physical activity level is a three can three level categorical variable rather than a binary verbal.

229
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:09,390
An outcome is binary so. The notation would be.

230
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:32,490
So for question. For a we sat there is no statistical association.

231
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:46,170
And. And we identified close to an end direct pass.

232
00:47:46,180 --> 00:48:00,010
So the. Sorry I forgot to like first give you notations regarding the exposure and outcome.

233
00:48:00,190 --> 00:48:06,550
The exposure and outcome. So the exposure a would be.

234
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:16,560
A three level exposure of crude oil could give them value as 012 and zero spend.

235
00:48:17,850 --> 00:48:20,850
Low physical activity. And the one is.

236
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:39,100
Intermediate level physical activity. And two is high level physical activity and outcome is why we is binary variable right and zeros stands for.

237
00:48:41,570 --> 00:48:50,930
Did not have this disease. And one stands for me. And so far, no statistical association.

238
00:48:51,650 --> 00:49:09,730
The formula would be. The probability of developing the outcome among those who have exposure started to.

239
00:49:10,670 --> 00:49:14,170
Not statue they expel among those who have low physical activity.

240
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:23,660
It would equal to the probability of developing the outcome among those who had low physical activity and also.

241
00:49:24,890 --> 00:49:31,190
We need and we also need to have this equation.

242
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:40,010
Among those who had high physical activity, the probability of developing outcome would e cultural.

243
00:49:41,410 --> 00:49:49,300
The probability of developing outcome among those who were who have low physical activity and.

244
00:49:51,070 --> 00:49:58,420
The probability of developing the outcome among those who had high physical activity would equal to the

245
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:05,530
probability of the lab developing the outcome among those who have intermediate level of physical activity.

246
00:50:11,510 --> 00:50:18,799
And also because there is because for a we identify there is no association, which means there is also no causation.

247
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:25,730
Right, because the existing of association is prerequisite for existing of causation.

248
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:34,910
So you also need another sad solve equations, which which means there is no causation.

249
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:40,630
So the probability of. Developing counterfactual.

250
00:50:41,810 --> 00:50:45,130
The that the probability of developing the outcome.

251
00:50:45,430 --> 00:50:57,730
Had all people in these population had intermediate level of physical activity were equal to the probability of developing the outcome had all.

252
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:05,670
Individuals had low level of physical activity and the same.

253
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:19,860
Oh, sorry. The probability of developing the outcome.

254
00:51:20,130 --> 00:51:24,780
Had all people had high physical activity would equal to the probability of developing the outcome.

255
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:29,430
Had all people have low level of physical activity.

256
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:47,520
And also. The probability of developing the outcome had all people had high level of physical activity would be would equal to

257
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:55,800
the probability of developing the outcome had all people were exposed to intermediate level of physical activity.

258
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:57,540
So this is for.

259
00:51:59,230 --> 00:52:16,390
Four for eight the notation for for a book and the notation for for B is for B we d we identified association, but no causation, right?

260
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:19,840
So basically.

261
00:52:23,690 --> 00:52:27,830
Basically you just changed the notation for the association.

262
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:31,520
For this one, this part. This part stands for association.

263
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:37,370
Right. So if there is the association, which means the probability would not equal between all these.

264
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:42,590
Between different levels of exposure, right?

265
00:52:42,890 --> 00:52:52,130
I still need to specify like the probability of developing outcome and or counterfactual association are equal so that there is no association.

266
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:59,270
So there so that there is no causation. So our goal has to is write all these.

267
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:12,100
Probabilities. So when the probabilities are equal, there is no association.

268
00:53:12,670 --> 00:53:21,610
And in this case, you could say and or because as long as there is like comparing one level to another level.

269
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:28,740
If there are if the probability of developing the outcome is.

270
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:38,380
Um. And you can see there is association.

271
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:46,430
Why you call one among people. Okay.

272
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:56,840
So this stands for there is no association and I will not write again for no causation form and I just copy and paste these under here.

273
00:53:57,550 --> 00:54:10,370
And so for the next question. So for Fauci, we identified causation.

274
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:15,450
And when there is a causation, it means there is there muscle.

275
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:22,680
It means that association must also exist. Right. So you all need these.

276
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:31,350
BLOCK are formula and also now you have to change like the the equation sign to

277
00:54:31,350 --> 00:54:38,930
add the e cosine to any cosine which which stands for Thereisno association ray.

278
00:54:41,400 --> 00:55:09,350
So. Yes.

279
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:15,120
Because for B, like for B, there are A's association.

280
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:19,680
So you have this kind of formula, right? But there is no causation.

281
00:55:21,270 --> 00:55:25,320
No causation, so no causation. You need have this formula.

282
00:55:26,610 --> 00:55:31,950
And are here. Right. But for Fauci, you Fauci, there is causation,

283
00:55:31,950 --> 00:55:40,019
which means that there is also association because the existing of association is prerequisites for the existing causation.

284
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:45,750
Right. So first, I read the formula for association exist.

285
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:56,320
And then I read a formula for causation exist.

286
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:38,909
So basically this is just saying that heads or individuals in this population exposed to intermediate level of physical activity,

287
00:56:38,910 --> 00:56:44,400
their probability of developing the outcome is equal to their poverty of development.

288
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:50,640
Developing outcome had all of them exposed to to low level of physical activity.

289
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:54,810
So which means there is an association. There is the causation, sorry.

290
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:58,860
There is a causal cause causation between exposure and outcome.

291
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:04,530
Or you can find comparing another to counterfactual level of exposure.

292
00:57:04,530 --> 00:57:12,690
If the probability of developing outcome is at equal, we can see that a cause y right?

293
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:21,810
Or you comparing level two two to level one. So this example is a little bit complicated than what you probably said because there is three level,

294
00:57:22,110 --> 00:57:26,730
because the exposure is a three level categorical outcome.

295
00:57:27,450 --> 00:57:41,160
So you need to like I said, you can have two different groups as you are comparison group like one maybe are a Coke zero and another is a cold one.

296
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:50,840
So. Yeah, so that's what we have for today's lab.
