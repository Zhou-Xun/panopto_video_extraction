1
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:12,660
I don't think there is, but I think they're saying that in a couple years or so.

2
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:24,190
I think that, you know, I don't know.

3
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:37,780
I think that you can't really get over that.

4
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:43,930
Yeah. That's being invested in everything else going on.

5
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:56,610
It's kind of like Monday, like you and I just do whatever it is.

6
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,820
It's kind of like, Oh really?

7
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:10,050
So today I'm going to try and go over some terminology and sort of a technological model, and then we have a long weekend.

8
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,170
So we have to have a New York on Monday.

9
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:19,250
And then next week I'm going to go over assignment instructions and we'll release your project groups.

10
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:23,219
So next Friday you'll have two things.

11
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,970
Do your first theory, assessment and group contract.

12
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:35,190
So what we plan to do is release the assignment instructions so you get a chance to review them.

13
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:40,380
So then during class, I'm going to go over content and very briefly go over this,

14
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:46,890
I guess instructions from with any questions that you have and you will get your group

15
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:53,040
before we meet again at one stage so you have an opportunity to connect with your members.

16
00:01:54,710 --> 00:02:03,420
So today what I want to do is really get us on the same page.

17
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:12,000
Some of you may have a social science background and some of you may have done some public health work from your undergraduate studies.

18
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:20,040
So let me know and be very new to this. So I just want to get us on the same page in terms of terminology that we'll be using.

19
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:25,980
Yeah, because I also want to provide an overview of the role of theory in public health

20
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:32,310
interventions and give you a broad perspective on where we're going the rest of the semester.

21
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:39,719
So for the remainder of the session will then go into more detail in a more a step by

22
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:45,990
step process that will ultimately lead us back to some of the stuff we cover today.

23
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:54,270
So I'm going a little broad today and then in the coming weeks we'll go into the weeds and then some of this will come together.

24
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:05,610
So I want to start with a definition of in theory, there are a bunch of different definitions you'll find in various social science literatures,

25
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:12,240
and here are a few that I pull to give you an idea of the range of definitions that are out there.

26
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:21,300
And the bottom line is one that I like particularly, and it's defined by Phil Zimbardo.

27
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:30,630
Zimbardo is a psychologist out of Stanford who has done some really interesting work around.

28
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:33,900
So in social psychology, particularly around the idea,

29
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:43,140
so he defines theory as an abstract symbolic representation of what is considered to be reality,

30
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:49,290
a set of abstract statements designated to be some sort of portion of the real world.

31
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:57,690
So what we're really trying to do, and in theory is abstractly put together whatever phenomena we are actually seeing.

32
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:11,370
So now for the purpose of the theory, there are five characteristics that typically define a theory.

33
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:20,610
Theories tend to be very general and there typically are theories around smoking, unsafe sex, condom use,

34
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:30,329
or wearing your seatbelt in your theory at a time, your actual theory textbook that you're assigned for this course.

35
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:38,190
It's mentioned that theories are by nature abstract and don't have a specified area on the topic.

36
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:45,150
And what we're going to learn in this course is how these abstract theories have been applied to a wide range of public health problems.

37
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:54,930
So you really don't have theories that are very specific to specific types of very specific types of things.

38
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:59,490
A theory usually covers a broad spectrum of human behavior.

39
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:06,140
There are some theories related to help, but when they are, they're still really, really broad.

40
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,540
They're not so siloed and specific to a specific unit.

41
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:17,080
Most theories are adaptable to different kinds of human behavior.

42
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,760
For example, we're going to learn about social cognitive theory in this class.

43
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,940
So cognitive theory has been used widely in public health interventions when it's also been

44
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:33,190
used extensively in academic learning and understanding violent behavior and aggression.

45
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:42,400
So something like social cognitive theory spans just a wide range of human behavior and can be applied to many different contexts,

46
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:49,030
even beyond how theories really should be testable,

47
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:56,260
meaning that you should be able to test the different constructs or the major ideas that encompass a particular theory.

48
00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:00,400
One example might be something like miracles.

49
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:08,470
It's really hard to develop a theory around miracles or the idea of miracles because how would you measure that?

50
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:18,580
So it's a little maybe maybe some of you have some ideas, but I can't come up with a way that you would actually measure a miracle.

51
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:26,170
So how would you know that it actually occurred? It's really tough to test, but it doesn't mean that it's not real.

52
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:32,940
Maybe 400 years from now, we will figure it out and maybe become part of our science.

53
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:39,670
But the theory really needs to be testable a way to measure some of the major ideas.

54
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:48,760
So theory has to be general testable, and it also has to be abstract, which I mentioned, and it also has to be replicable.

55
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:50,860
So can you test it again?

56
00:06:51,610 --> 00:07:01,300
So if I actually dropped my pen down and it falls on the floor, if I did it again when it also dropped down on the floor again.

57
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:08,470
So that that's what it means for me being able to replicate it and support that.

58
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,450
So when we think about theories, they typically meet all five of these criteria.

59
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:19,370
Do you have any questions about what a theory is? Yeah.

60
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,650
Can you repeat the goal of theories?

61
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:36,630
So the the goal of theories is really is putting together something abstract around some sort of phenomena that we are seeing.

62
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:42,170
So we might sort of see some behavior or something occurring.

63
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:50,360
And it gives us a framework or something, some sort of parameter to put around what that means.

64
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:57,430
Still very broad. And then we get more specific around defining what that.

65
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:02,300
Yeah, just I'm coming at this from a back, a math background.

66
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:08,570
So like if something is abstract, it would be hard for you to measure it physically.

67
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:15,060
Right. So, so can you just, like, explain a little bit more about how something can be both testable and abstract?

68
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:19,850
It's feel like if it's testable, you're defining something that you are testing.

69
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:24,640
Which wouldn't that make it? Not abstract? And.

70
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:30,960
Abstract meaning. It's not so specified, it's broad.

71
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:35,910
So I think you could use broad and abstract.

72
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,200
Okay. Misleading here. Isn't that covered by general, then?

73
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:47,130
Yeah. Yeah.

74
00:08:47,190 --> 00:09:05,490
I mean. I think General is more meaning that it's not so specified.

75
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:09,480
So, yeah, you have theories and math. You have theories in physics.

76
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:19,740
Yeah. And in general they are abstract but applied to very specific problems in math and physics.

77
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:29,010
But in general, like. What they mean by abstract is, again, you have different concept.

78
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:35,340
I'm going to get into concepts and constructs and you get more specific into defining.

79
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:47,010
Okay. So one of the reasons why I'm going through like what a theory is because you're

80
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:51,720
going to be building conceptual models in this class that are very specific.

81
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:56,100
And those are not theories. You're not developing theories of this ask,

82
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:06,750
but you're you're going to be looking at very specific behaviors and public health problems and applying abstract concepts,

83
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:14,790
other theories to that specific issue and conceptual model that you're building.

84
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:21,840
So I kind of just started with a hope answers question, like, if you think of a theory from like a public health perspective,

85
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,830
like public health is more community driven, not individual driven.

86
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:27,580
So like you want to find a way.

87
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:33,030
The reason why it's broad is because you want to find a way of how it can apply to multiple people, not just one person at a time.

88
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:37,120
Like a medical perspective. That can help you understand a little bit more.

89
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:42,490
That's kind of how I would understand it. Yeah, I just I wouldn't have chosen abstract as the word in that regard.

90
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:51,969
Yeah. You know what I'll come back to and there are many different ways people define theories and the characteristics,

91
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:55,120
and maybe we can come up with something a little more straightforward.

92
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:58,690
If these definitions are failing when they overlap.

93
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:09,790
One of the things in this class things are really great and not black and white like matter of physics at time.

94
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:21,790
So as we go through different theories, you'll have to kind of if that's the way you tend to think where we're trying to think,

95
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:27,700
you'll have to sort of live in the gray. And that might be a little uncomfortable for some of us, but we'll we'll get there.

96
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:34,150
And I hope to show you sort of the pros and cons of many of these theories.

97
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:41,410
You know, where they work, where they don't work, good evidence behind them, where they're lacking, etc.

98
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:50,990
So within theories, there are these things called concepts which are really major components or ideas of a theory.

99
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:58,580
So one example is with perceptions that might be a concept within a theory.

100
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:04,640
Um, like what is your view of how you, how at risk you are in a particular situation?

101
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:10,130
And when we put this concept into a model like a conceptual model,

102
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:20,210
such as the health belief model that we'll talk about next week, this concept concept becomes a set of constructs.

103
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:30,840
So visually it turns into maybe a box or a set of boxes and arrows sort of pointing to each other and all these other things.

104
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:38,810
So sort of major components and ideas of it theory are called concepts.

105
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:44,900
And one example again is risk perception and the hopefully belief model, which we'll dissect next week.

106
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:56,089
Risk perception is a set of very specific constructs that is represented in a virus, and a variable is an operationalized form of a concept,

107
00:12:56,090 --> 00:13:01,190
and it sort of specifies how that construct is going to be measured in that particular model.

108
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:09,240
So then a variable needs to have variation. So that means that it has to have different you have to have the ability to change.

109
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,240
That's why we call it a variable.

110
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:21,440
So for risk perception, if you were trying to measure this concept, which is now as a variable, you might ask someone, you know,

111
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:27,770
compared to someone your same age and gender, how likely is it that you're going to get hit by a car while you're crossing the street?

112
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,600
And what might respond much worse than the average compared to other people.

113
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:35,150
So there are a lot of different ways to measure risk perception.

114
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:42,740
And this is just one example of how you might do that. Theories.

115
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:50,000
Help us explain what's going on and tell us why it's really all about why.

116
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:58,459
For example, one question we might ask ourselves is Why are clinicians following guideline recommended care

117
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:03,050
when we know that there are evidence based recommendations that can improve people's health?

118
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:07,040
So I might use a theory to figure out why this is happening.

119
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:10,610
That's a very interesting question, very specific problem.

120
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:14,540
And I might use that theory to help figure out why that's happening.

121
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,329
So if you know the why, this can help figure out what we need to do and whether we should develop an

122
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:26,059
intervention or a policy of theories can also help us shape the intervention

123
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:37,010
so that it reaches the intended target population and also what we need to evaluate in order to know whether program or policy actually works.

124
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,230
So we have theories that help us define a particular problem,

125
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:47,330
and then we have theories that also help us take action and guide the development of interventions.

126
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:53,090
So we go through some particular theories and models and this cause.

127
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,259
I'm going to point out to you what that theory helps us do.

128
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:04,309
Some of them help us define a problem, but there are many that don't help us develop innovation.

129
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:12,780
So I'm going to tell you what what actually helps you develop interventions or the activities in an intervention to support your.

130
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:24,530
So a conceptual model is different from theory because they're not really concerned with global GDP se,

131
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:29,210
but with specific types of behaviors in very specific contexts.

132
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:36,500
So we usually use conceptual models as a visual diagram of a specific research question or an intervention.

133
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:44,659
After that, we're really trying to undertake. So one of the biggest projects that you will do in this class to build a conceptual

134
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:48,739
model with your group members related to a particular public health problem.

135
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:51,020
And you're going to get very specific about that.

136
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:59,840
And once we go through some of the major theories in public health, and there's a step by step process of how you actually build the model,

137
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:09,590
you'll be very equipped to do this on your own and we'll be going through and actually how you build conceptual models.

138
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:20,540
About two weeks. So no theory is perfect.

139
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,920
Yeah. Sorry. I had a quick question on the previously.

140
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:31,160
It's different from a theory because it's not concerned with global warming, I'm sure.

141
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:40,730
Yeah. So you're not going to le create a conceptual model around.

142
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:53,190
Like the idea of like like risk perception is just such a big, unwieldy concept that you just can't.

143
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:56,730
How about a conceptual model around that? That's not very specific,

144
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:04,350
but you might look at risk perception related to very specific behavior and create a model around that with a very specified outcome.

145
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:15,150
And the things that employ the models, like infant mortality, like based on one particular public health issue.

146
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:19,900
Yeah. Random theory, which is kind of like. Okay. Yeah. And you would get even more specific.

147
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:27,350
So even infant mortality is a lot of things you can look at for what outcome are we really looking at in that area?

148
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,760
And that's what you're going to do with your project.

149
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:36,719
So, you know, when you guys checked off your topics of interest, the last time we met, those were still very broad.

150
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:42,620
But when you get into groups, one of the first things you're going to do is get even more specific than that.

151
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:49,170
What population do you want to focus on? What issue in that area do you want to explore through the semester?

152
00:17:52,590 --> 00:18:02,190
So no theories are perfect and some theories from the math and science disciplines such as, you know, what is behind gravity?

153
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:05,340
Can they explain a lot of the variation in outcomes?

154
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:15,059
But in social science, our theories don't explain as much of the variation in outcomes as we would like in across studies.

155
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:22,650
We found that about 20 to 40% of our theories explain variation in health outcomes,

156
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:28,290
suggesting that there may be a lot of other things that are not accounted for in a particular theory,

157
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:32,130
and that's really explaining whatever outcome we're interested in.

158
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:37,350
So that doesn't mean people aren't trying and the stuff we're learning is nonsense.

159
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:45,600
So those numbers might not give you a lot of confidence. What this means is that there's still a lot of work to be done in explaining behavior,

160
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:54,150
and why people do the things they do is very hard and we really have to take a lot of factors into account.

161
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:59,549
So one of the reasons why we don't see as much change from interventions as we had

162
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:04,800
hoped is because we are often not defining the health problems that we are looking at

163
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:09,809
from a theoretical perspective or making sure our intervention strategies really align

164
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:15,900
with some sort of theoretical foundation of our health problem or intervention.

165
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:22,530
So so there are really two reasons why we are seeing this sort of variation in

166
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:31,830
outcomes and not having many of our theories explain more of that variation.

167
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:35,700
One is that behavior in itself is just really complex.

168
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:43,829
And two, we need to do a better job of using theory. We don't we don't do a good job of that in general.

169
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:48,690
And that that sort of signifies the importance of this clause.

170
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,580
So after this class,

171
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:59,970
I really hope that you guys will be equipped well to do that and hopefully make a more substantial leap in the areas of health behavior as a result.

172
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:06,090
And some of you may be very interested in devoting your careers to theory development,

173
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:12,270
especially in the health area, but there are a lot of opportunities to do that.

174
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:24,330
So we all know that people should change their behaviors for a host of reasons, but simply don't do it.

175
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:33,870
So one more question I want to pose to you from one of your readings is what did McLeroy mean by

176
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:41,050
victim blaming and lifestyle theory in one of the readings this week on the social ecologic approach?

177
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:44,280
So you talked about victim blaming the lifestyle theory.

178
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:56,370
What did he mean by that? Yeah, generally that society kind of faults the individual for poor health outcomes instead of addressing society itself.

179
00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:02,130
So disease and ill health as a result of our own personal failures.

180
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:14,460
So that paper came out in 1988. Meanwhile, we like to believe that victim blaming has since been eradicated.

181
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:26,070
Given that it's 2022 and unfortunately is not the classic example is some of the issues on the war on obesity

182
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:35,340
where some still truly believe that the fundamental causes of weight problem is that people are just lazy.

183
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:44,710
You've probably heard that here. And there is one sort of hypothesis of why we have an obesity epidemic in this country.

184
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:49,880
So, you know. McLeroy, you talked about this in 1988.

185
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:55,290
It's 2022 and unfortunately, we still have some victim blaming in our film.

186
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:09,940
So this is where the social ecological framework becomes really critical in understanding public health and coming up with effective solutions to big,

187
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:13,210
complex problems that we confront.

188
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:22,990
And if we're going to take on the complex task of changing people's behavior, we cannot ignore environmental influences on health.

189
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:27,370
We simply can't sue me personally.

190
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:36,520
Gravitate towards individual approaches to behavior change, or some of you may personally gravitate more towards community or structural levels.

191
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:45,130
And, you know, usually we see a wide range of preferences in class, but in general,

192
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:52,180
there is too much strong evidence now on the effects of individual and environmental interactions on health,

193
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:59,410
that we have to really take both sort of perspectives into account and integrate them.

194
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:09,340
And as public health practitioners with some of the issues that we face as a society, the stakes are just too high to turn a blind eye to,

195
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:16,980
you know, environmental approaches or just focus on environmental approaches and not even focus on the individual.

196
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:26,290
So we have to sort of look at people with multiple sort of concentric circles of influence.

197
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:35,970
And this is the perspective that is shared by major public health agencies such as Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S.,

198
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:41,230
the National Academies of Medicine, the World Health Organization, just to name a few.

199
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:49,210
More and more endorsing this idea of multilevel influences on behavior.

200
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:58,870
So what the ecological perspective argues is that in order to see a substantial change in health behaviors with the potential for wider reach,

201
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:03,580
we need to consider both individual level and environmental and policy factors.

202
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:09,190
And when I say environment, I mean both the physical environment and also the social environment as well.

203
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:20,800
And the origins of this ecological perspective are really housed in psychology, where it was first proposed by Gary Bronfenbrenner.

204
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:28,450
And in the library reading, they go into depth about micro and macro system levels.

205
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:38,860
And in this ecological perspective, from psychology, that's what's really informed the social ecological model that's often used in public health.

206
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:45,940
And as we think about all the different kinds of things that influence a public health problem, our behavior interests.

207
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:49,210
So what I walk us through some of the different levels.

208
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:57,290
When we think about the interpersonal and individual levels, it's really the individual person.

209
00:24:57,310 --> 00:25:02,950
So when you use your intra personal really means like the things going on inside our heads,

210
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:07,690
like our knowledge, our attitudes, our beliefs really focused on the individual.

211
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,459
And then we have the interpersonal,

212
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:18,310
which is the people around us and our interpersonal interactions with those people or social networks or friends or family or our peers.

213
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:25,419
And then organizations comprise social institutions with operating norms.

214
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:30,250
It can be it can be school, it could be our workplaces.

215
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:43,690
It can be a community based organization. And then we have community, which refers to a few different things.

216
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:51,110
It can refer to geography. It refer to shared identity or a more defined area.

217
00:25:51,130 --> 00:26:03,880
So community can be a little more loose, but typically refers to either geography, shared identity, multiple organizations or a social institution.

218
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:10,420
And then we have policies both at national, state and local levels and different sort of regulations.

219
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:16,870
And I would say it's not really apparent on here, but with policy,

220
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:26,710
I might also add ideology because ideology can also trickle down into our policies and impacts.

221
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:37,550
So typically, ecological models provided framework for really integrating multiple theories and models to illustrate a comprehensive approach.

222
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:45,610
So I like to start off with this model because for the remainder of the class, we're going to sort of make our way through these different models.

223
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:49,930
So next week, I'm going to start with some individual level theories.

224
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:57,730
Then we're going to go into, you know, interpersonal, organizational and community level theories and towards.

225
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:05,180
The latter half of the semester and talk about a theory of fundamental causes and other sort

226
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:12,910
of concepts that really get at ideology and structural factors that influence behavior.

227
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:16,010
So that's sort of the way the course is organized.

228
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:23,239
And one of the reasons why I like to start with this, like this is sort of the frame and we're going to get specific,

229
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:32,530
but this is sort of a structure that is more accepted in our discipline now.

230
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:43,230
So behavior change according to the social ecological approach is maximized when environments and policies support healthful choices.

231
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:51,000
Social norms and social support for healthful choices are strong and individuals are

232
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:57,720
motivated and feel like they have the tools and skills to make healthier choices as well.

233
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:05,460
So these are the three conditions under which the social and ecological model tells us that behavior change is really acceptable.

234
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:16,630
So I want you to keep these five principles in mind when thinking about the ecological perspective.

235
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:21,700
There are multiple levels that go beyond the individual that influence behavior.

236
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:29,380
The environment and situations that people are in can be really significant predictors of behavior.

237
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:36,940
Influences on behavior, interactive across levels, across all those different levels we talked about.

238
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:47,290
And models are very behavior specific and behavior changes maximize when people have the knowledge and skills to take action and they

239
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:55,090
are motivated and their social environments support the behavior and the environment and policies also support that to be fair.

240
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:04,750
So there are some weaknesses to the ecological perspective and including lack of specificity of the most

241
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:10,880
important hypothesized factors that drive behavior change or that can change an outcome of interest.

242
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:17,590
So we're really talking generally that you should work across levels, but you might be wondering, well,

243
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:28,450
is it really the community that has more influence on individual behavior change, or is it like more so that interpersonal language?

244
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:35,440
Why waste more? We just we don't really know that. And it sort of depends on the behavior you're looking at and the context.

245
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:40,300
We want to be parsimonious but comprehensive at the same time.

246
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:56,290
So I think some of the for some people, this sort of approach may seem too personal because we want more details, but we want to be able to.

247
00:29:56,290 --> 00:30:04,629
And so that is one of the limitations that some people sort of impose with the ecological approach that it is a little too

248
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:13,480
parsimonious or we just don't have enough information around what more specific factors across these levels drive behavior,

249
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,500
change the best.

250
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:26,310
So I want to show you just a couple examples of an ecological framework and what that might look like when they're applied to public health problems.

251
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:32,910
So here's one that Dr. Amy Schultz in Haiti, she's one of our faculty members.

252
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:38,370
She created this to guide her group's work with their Healthy Environments partnership.

253
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:51,600
This was a CPR partnership that was created to reduce cardiovascular risk factors in Detroit through a community based participatory research mandate.

254
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:55,740
And as you can see in this social ecological model,

255
00:30:56,070 --> 00:31:02,729
it outlines how policies and racial inequities in Detroit have influence the community and

256
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:09,600
organizational structures to increase stressors that affect social relationships and health behaviors,

257
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:13,950
which in turn influence cardiovascular risk outcomes.

258
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:20,730
So this is a very specific ecological approach to understanding cardiovascular risk factors.

259
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:37,340
So this just sort of highlights the mission of the Healthy Environments partnerships.

260
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:43,520
Their goal is to really develop interventions to address aspects of the social and physical

261
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:49,930
environment that contribute to racial and socio economic disparities in cardiovascular disease.

262
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:55,040
So they want to develop interventions across the social and physical environment,

263
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:59,899
and this framework really helps them guide that where when they understand what

264
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:08,240
those those social and physical factors are that influence individual outcomes.

265
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,970
So a few milestones from their work.

266
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:28,680
Since they started in 2000, they've been able to look at stressful social, economic conditions and Detroit neighborhoods around cardiovascular risk.

267
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:36,120
They've been able to look at neighborhood walkability and the built environment, and they've also been able to look at the food environment.

268
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:42,660
And as it relates to cardiovascular risk, including the location of grocery stores and access to healthy foods.

269
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:46,200
And they've also looked at air quality as well.

270
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:57,060
And I believe that's an area that that that Dr. Schultz continues to look at as healthy environment partnerships has evolved.

271
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:03,670
So social ecological models come in all sort of shapes and forms.

272
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:08,910
And here's another example. This one is for risk factors regarding interpersonal violence.

273
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:17,220
Sometimes you might see these models together, community and organization, and as you see in this model.

274
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:24,329
And later in this course, it will really tease out the differences between what is community and what is organization and

275
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:30,150
what are different sort of frameworks and theories that you can use and change on those levels.

276
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:39,150
But aside from that, what we see here is we see multiple levels of factors that influence interpersonal violence.

277
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:44,950
So again, just another example to show you visually what this looks.

278
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:54,140
So again, like I said on Monday, one of my goals in this class is that you're applying what we learn.

279
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:58,810
So what I talked about was a little abstract and just giving you an overview.

280
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:03,520
But my goal is to give you many opportunities to apply what you're learning,

281
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:08,260
because it's only through practice that this is going to become more second nature.

282
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:15,160
And we want you to be very equipped to go into program planning next semester in 651.

283
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:24,760
So one thing I would like for you to do, we're going to spend a little time actually working through an ecological model.

284
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:31,450
So we want to put you guys into groups of four or five with people around you.

285
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:39,010
And I'd like for you guys to identify factors at each level of the socio economic ecological model,

286
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:42,680
the impact, the outcome of interest on your assigned worksheet.

287
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:51,010
So I identified some specific sort of outcomes that would be my specific sort of issues or outcomes we might look at.

288
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:55,210
And I want you to work with your group members to think about the factors at

289
00:34:56,140 --> 00:35:00,700
the various levels of the ecological models that might influence that outcome.

290
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:13,750
And my goal is for you to come up with something like this or like this, sort of thinking about what those different factors are.

291
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:33,510
So Dominique is going to go ahead and pass these out because they should.

292
00:35:36,420 --> 00:36:00,910
People just want to talk to you for the next year, just like.

293
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:08,180
Oh, yeah, right.

294
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:17,920
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

295
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:30,930
You want to be like, you want to be wrong?

296
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:55,510
I like to talk about these things, which was the sort of, you know,

297
00:36:55,750 --> 00:37:17,160
any kind of like sort of what would you like to hear when I was going to be meeting with my father?

298
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:33,540
I think what he's going to tell my friend policy is telling me because you didn't know.

299
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:53,580
I think it's very encouraging, especially as it turns out that there are five genes.

300
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:58,570
And, you know, I can do that.

301
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:03,300
So if you're in a group that's like three people, go ahead and join another group.

302
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:23,250
We print it out enough for us. Now, you know, we're just gonna need to share among ourselves if your name is going to be on the table.

303
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:40,139
So that's why I think School of Labor, like, you know, we're going to see people make history and get into,

304
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:45,150
like, features of life and offer the society insight on its hand.

305
00:38:48,670 --> 00:39:11,610
So let's start again. Let's start with the individual responsibility, because I think that's what this individual should be like.

306
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:21,110
Okay, so here's the social class.

307
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:45,510
So it's not just like, oh, like it says not all the time, player sister, if you haven't got everything, you know, it's great.

308
00:39:45,720 --> 00:40:13,040
You know, it's like it's like, okay, I go, you know, I was going to go with the first value slash knowledge experience.

309
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:37,240
But I think about my friends. So right now we're doing something that you're just like, Oh yeah, so I'm crazy about something like this.

310
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:48,879
I was like, I'm just going to you because it wasn't.

311
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:52,360
She was like, it was like a recent interview.

312
00:40:52,430 --> 00:41:15,020
Like, I was thinking like, that's what I heard that I think, oh, yeah, oh, yeah.

313
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:19,440
You know, sorry. We can't think right now.

314
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:25,390
Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah.

315
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:28,660
That's the policy either, right?

316
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:41,530
Because they have all these guys like how are you going to do what you might do if you live in a big city?

317
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:50,260
I think we're definitely like inner city college, even though.

318
00:41:53,020 --> 00:42:02,620
Oh, my God. I feel like that my weight is like my textbook explained it.

319
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:18,010
It's like, I think organizational. Organizational is like, have like a million diseases in your community, like work with each other.

320
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:25,660
Is there some sort of like it's slightly broader.

321
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:49,060
And so we have like there's a taxing standard of like is the biggest part is slightly more like a policy.

322
00:42:50,460 --> 00:43:06,400
Like if you're going out to the ceremony, maybe it's going to be like to meet you back to the prom.

323
00:43:08,530 --> 00:43:17,860
You know, nudity would be like like an organization.

324
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:29,780
Like, I know that there's like a slight difference on policies.

325
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:46,910
I mean, you know, like, that's not the right time, I think.

326
00:43:48,300 --> 00:44:01,050
I don't think that's. You have to think how to make money.

327
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:13,900
You are forced to sell the house.

328
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:18,670
I was going to say something like this.

329
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:27,730
How do you know when you're really so strong?

330
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:34,990
Individual rising prices are also gonna for a lot of these choices.

331
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:53,850
Society matters. I have never seen one here like this very natural choice to dictate that you go to the ground.

332
00:44:54,130 --> 00:44:58,150
They have a huge problem. They do like it.

333
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:11,160
So, I mean, I'm worried about but I guess when you have 4.9% interest.

334
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:31,330
So I just don't like this. I think you can actually work out what happens.

335
00:45:33,490 --> 00:45:37,810
I think yeah. Because I think that would be I think that would be different than politics.

336
00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:51,160
That's a real organizational change because it would happen now.

337
00:45:52,390 --> 00:45:58,570
So the first thing is just something that you said they kind of.

338
00:45:58,810 --> 00:46:04,230
Yeah, well, what I want to know.

339
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:23,400
I like half an hour here at the same time, like you said, it should be public.

340
00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:27,040
I believe we should be public. That's what I was kind of trying to get out.

341
00:46:30,190 --> 00:46:35,740
I know that you're an excellent super.

342
00:46:35,770 --> 00:46:44,530
Or I guess the organization can be like Tiger, but as I said, I heard about it and I was like,

343
00:46:46,720 --> 00:47:04,080
Yeah, it's like, okay, if I can't be on the other side of that,

344
00:47:05,960 --> 00:48:06,820
I just like, I've been thinking about it because I'm like, Oh yeah, we're going to be kind of like, I'm not going to be like that.

345
00:48:08,030 --> 00:48:25,550
There is no doubt in my mind, not only right.

346
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:36,220
So what about I really like that in practice.

347
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:41,020
What about like, look at me. Talk about the states.

348
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:49,450
We're. All right. Thank you. Very well. This is probably I think we're kind of wrapping up.

349
00:48:49,450 --> 00:49:08,130
Yeah. So. Interference that we were trying to protect the Israelis,

350
00:49:09,390 --> 00:49:26,140
but she didn't go to bat was kind of like the same because it's like maybe it's like I do think

351
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:33,960
I want to come back to this side of the fence filling out international channel interviews.

352
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:57,820
I think it was like that more and more of these standards, and I surprised myself.

353
00:49:58,810 --> 00:50:07,630
Part of it is like I think matters if you're a political saying you should be your friend if you don't do this.

354
00:50:09,190 --> 00:50:32,050
Okay. What about community by the yuan? I was definitely like I guess like like like secretly I feel like, you know, I,

355
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:43,330
I might have to go, you know, it's like it's like you can get like a 90 power.

356
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:50,280
Is that socially conservative?

357
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:56,350
Yeah. I don't even have that problem.

358
00:50:56,380 --> 00:51:07,900
That's the problem. You guys really want something that was like, we want to be like any section.

359
00:51:07,970 --> 00:51:13,120
U.S., Japan, you didn't plan.

360
00:51:13,450 --> 00:51:19,480
Topics. What was this one floating around did you guys worked on?

361
00:51:19,990 --> 00:51:28,510
So just love your feedback. Like were there was this very straightforward were there certain levels like turkey at first for you?

362
00:51:28,510 --> 00:51:35,739
Like like this is so easy. She showed us the picture and I was making a play for that.

363
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:40,690
So did any of that reaction, was it harder than you expected?

364
00:51:42,450 --> 00:51:47,259
Yeah, I was. It was hard to expect, like from Grasp and you're like, oh, this, this is that.

365
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:54,190
But then when you start thinking more of like a different consulate, we like separating organizational community now.

366
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:57,760
I mean, I'm just like, wait, I know organization.

367
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:02,470
I think of like structure. Whereas communities were like, you know.

368
00:52:04,030 --> 00:52:08,950
Yeah, yeah. Right. You have to put some definition exact around that to differentiate.

369
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:13,750
Yeah, I agree. And I feel like a lot of it was like subjective, like what I thought was community.

370
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:17,530
Leila But I thought it was organizational.

371
00:52:17,530 --> 00:52:19,809
So we kind of had to like come to a group consensus of like, okay,

372
00:52:19,810 --> 00:52:24,040
what do we like as a whole think is community and then what can we place into there?

373
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:29,889
Because a lot of our stuff we realize like blood into the other and that's kind of like go back and figure that out.

374
00:52:29,890 --> 00:52:33,810
So we did a lot of working backwards. I guess so.

375
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:40,150
Yeah. Do you think culture would fit more into community or into ideology?

376
00:52:40,170 --> 00:52:43,440
Because I know you said ideology influences policy.

377
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:49,559
And in some areas, culture, religion is a huge part of that influence.

378
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:54,330
But I think specifically, probably here in this country, it would be community because it's a shared identity.

379
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:02,240
Yeah. And again, it goes back to again being more specific.

380
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:08,850
I think that if you're if your model is in the context of looking at the country and what was your outcome?

381
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:17,570
Sleep, just getting enough sleep. So you were thinking about getting enough sleep in the context of this country.

382
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:24,130
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Like that was sort of the parameters you were working in.

383
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:29,049
So then you might've been probably if it was me,

384
00:53:29,050 --> 00:53:38,200
I would consider culture probably more broader US culture ideology that perhaps

385
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:45,160
influences policies around people being able to actually get enough sleep.

386
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:55,510
Whereas if you were maybe looking at an organization, maybe students at the University of Michigan getting enough sleep,

387
00:53:55,810 --> 00:54:01,330
you might look at the culture of the University of Michigan and perhaps divide that in the.

388
00:54:07,790 --> 00:54:14,240
Yeah. And we had wearing, says Jean. And I was surprised by how easy it was in up personally.

389
00:54:14,310 --> 00:54:20,389
There's so many hats hardly the individual goes and that I think kind of as we work their way out it got a

390
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:27,830
little bit harder to think of something other than like norms of like community or norms of organization.

391
00:54:28,550 --> 00:54:32,330
And in policy we again had more ideas.

392
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:37,840
The individual was like surprising or I felt like I thought it would take it would be harder to come up with something.

393
00:54:37,850 --> 00:54:41,010
It was, like, relatively easy to keep up with one of the ideas.

394
00:54:41,390 --> 00:54:44,490
Yeah, that one's interesting, right?

395
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:54,220
You know, in some other countries, there are, like, very specific policies around, like, types of sunscreens you can use and not use.

396
00:54:55,130 --> 00:55:01,910
So that's where, like policy level might trickle down to very specific individual behavior.

397
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:14,460
Other reactions or thoughts that came up in your group as you were working through this?

398
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:23,610
We had a decrease in sugar intake as our outcome, and we're able to kind of just bounce ideas off of each other and then identify,

399
00:55:23,850 --> 00:55:29,160
which I guess is more macro, where this is more micro, but then putting it in a specific category.

400
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:35,400
I feel like we struggled because they're so intertwined and there is so criteria that we find ourselves

401
00:55:36,090 --> 00:55:43,650
making cases for each category because of just how each of the categories interplay off of each other.

402
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:48,540
Okay. Do you have an example of one that you guys grappled with?

403
00:55:50,190 --> 00:55:51,060
Like culture.

404
00:55:52,550 --> 00:56:03,500
The culture of eating sugar, you know, whether that's for a holiday or maybe you have a psychological dependance on sugar family, I don't know.

405
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:08,370
Depends on sugar. Prefer sugar. Family history of eating sugar.

406
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:13,300
I don't know. So it's kind of hard to pinpoint exactly where that should go.

407
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:18,190
Yeah, and maybe it might have.

408
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:24,310
When did you guys start off, like, thinking about the parameters of that question?

409
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:29,580
Like decreasing sugar intake within a family or within society.

410
00:56:30,870 --> 00:56:42,090
Do you think that would have maybe helped? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

411
00:56:42,990 --> 00:56:51,930
So when you say defining the parameters, the thinking, coming up with this plan, basically based on each level.

412
00:56:55,050 --> 00:57:05,310
Yeah. And before you. Sorry, I just like gave you like sort of random behaviors and things we might think about or talk about.

413
00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:13,230
So, you know, one exercise and you're going to do this when you work in your groups and develop

414
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:19,260
your own conceptual model is you're going to think about a problem of interest.

415
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:27,809
But then before you even dove into this exercise, like simply put more parameters and definitions around it.

416
00:57:27,810 --> 00:57:36,090
So what are what population are we focused on where, you know, where is this problem most concentrated that we might focus on?

417
00:57:36,090 --> 00:57:50,310
So with decreasing sugar intake, maybe I would you do a quick search and see that the problem is most pronounced in children.

418
00:57:50,670 --> 00:57:53,220
So you decided to focus on children.

419
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:59,850
So you're really focused on, you know, when you're thinking about individual behavior, it's really focused on the child.

420
00:57:59,850 --> 00:58:05,700
So then when you're thinking about the interpersonal context of that child range,

421
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:13,019
their peers at school, their family, and maybe you end up focusing on the school context.

422
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:23,650
So when you think about organizations and community in policy, it's within those sort of part of really this should be I mean,

423
00:58:23,670 --> 00:58:31,350
our language around these should be formatted as steps like if we're working on decreasing sugar,

424
00:58:31,350 --> 00:58:39,470
we're not necessarily going to be using language that is directly controlling it.

425
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:45,870
We're going to be trying to sort of cater our responses to desired outcomes, basically.

426
00:58:47,250 --> 00:58:52,860
Yeah, yeah, that's a good question. And it's a very important and specific question.

427
00:58:52,860 --> 00:59:01,499
So when you're actually putting these models together, you're going to be creating like a problem focus model.

428
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:16,980
So when it comes to let's use the example of sugar intake, what are the factors that influence sugar intake, whether it's positive or negative?

429
00:59:17,910 --> 00:59:23,670
And again, a very variable or constricted a model has some variation.

430
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:32,040
So, you know, you can read the model through and then sort of negative ones, lack of a better word.

431
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:34,739
So too much sugar intake.

432
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:44,790
What are the factors that influence too much sugar intake and how really helping us identify the factors that influence that problem?

433
00:59:45,150 --> 00:59:50,490
Because when we see the problem like that, it helps us better design an intervention.

434
00:59:50,490 --> 00:59:57,629
We can see the things that influence that problem. So our intervention will then need to take some of those things into account and

435
00:59:57,630 --> 01:00:01,920
we can better pinpoint the things we choose to focus on in our intervention.

436
01:00:09,270 --> 01:00:16,470
So you're that's a great question because you're foreshadowing a lot of that feedback I end up giving through your drafts.

437
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:23,939
So when we go through building conceptual models in two weeks from now, I mean,

438
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:32,190
I walk you through like something I built when I was a student and I'll show you 25 drugs.

439
01:00:33,030 --> 01:00:38,140
So, you know, this isn't going to be where you sit down once and it's perfect.

440
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:45,090
You're going to go through several iterations and workshop it and continuously we'll give you feedback.

441
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:51,630
And but in the end, by the end of the semester, you'll hopefully have something you're happy with the next sentence.

442
01:00:52,170 --> 01:01:00,620
That's what we aim to do. Any other questions or comments about this exercise?

443
01:01:07,170 --> 01:01:11,300
Yeah. For one of our things, we kind of talking about where does church fall?

444
01:01:11,330 --> 01:01:16,520
Our topic was mental well-being. I'm like, Does it fall under like your community are going to be organization?

445
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:22,070
Because it does kind of consist of shared beliefs, but at the same time it can also serve as a community.

446
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:29,959
So what are you and how are you defining church or are you defining it as how are you thinking about it in this context?

447
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:34,840
As like I. Church.

448
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:45,190
As you know, it has a mission that has like the way it's structured or is it really about what comes out of church?

449
01:01:45,370 --> 01:01:51,640
What comes out of it? Yeah. Or like that that group that people belong to.

450
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:55,770
So then I would I might think of it as community.

451
01:01:55,780 --> 01:02:04,030
So the religious community that people are part of, because they may interact with that community outside of church as well.

452
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:10,300
So these are a lot of details and a lot of technicalities.

453
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:17,260
So I'm in the weeds person. So this is a very in the weeds type of class for me.

454
01:02:17,260 --> 01:02:22,839
Think about theory and clearly it's great. I'm not giving you a black or white answer here.

455
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:26,079
So it's going to be a lot of it depends.

456
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:32,530
But that's what I want to kind of train you guys into thinking that way because,

457
01:02:32,830 --> 01:02:37,510
you know, a lot of the issues we face in public health are not so cut and dry.

458
01:02:38,950 --> 01:02:43,720
It sort of takes a lot of thinking and examining them from different angles

459
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:51,570
and really make sure we're defining things in order to inform how we hope to.

460
01:02:54,390 --> 01:03:03,470
So I'm going to end class a little early because I want to make sure you're getting a good amount of stuff,

461
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:13,050
but I think I left you with a lot to think about. And we have a long weekend coming up, so I hope you enjoyed your day off.

462
01:03:13,590 --> 01:03:17,930
The homework question. Was there an attendance sheet circular later today?

463
01:03:17,970 --> 01:03:28,110
We just took attendance, so we should be fine. I will let you know if we can make it to D.C. So will reconvene again on Wednesday.

464
01:03:28,410 --> 01:03:34,739
We'll be sending out a couple of things over campus, including your group assignments before, once in person.

465
01:03:34,740 --> 01:03:38,680
Keep a lookout for that and then as soon as we can.

466
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:54,890
But I think it's a difficult thing to do.

467
01:03:57,270 --> 01:04:02,650
We just wanted to talk to her. Yeah.

468
01:04:04,990 --> 01:04:36,290
I thought, you know, I was going to say, good gracious, but you just got to go.

469
01:04:36,870 --> 01:04:44,010
I just get to go see your friend about that.

470
01:04:44,020 --> 01:04:48,850
Tell you what you want to see happen.

471
01:04:53,080 --> 01:04:56,580
I know, I know.

472
01:05:01,290 --> 01:05:06,010
Especially not a red flag.

473
01:05:10,340 --> 01:05:13,870
I want to let you go.

474
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:24,310
Like I said, let's all go right there now.

475
01:05:28,420 --> 01:05:31,900
Oh, [INAUDIBLE]. I was so tired.

476
01:05:33,670 --> 01:05:39,970
I know. I have to think about it.

477
01:05:41,300 --> 01:06:00,100
I'm serious. I'm going to have to do everything all right.

478
01:06:00,550 --> 01:06:04,090
Yeah. Or like you. Yeah. I mean, it's like.

479
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:08,300
You know what I mean?

480
01:06:09,970 --> 01:06:20,670
She's going to need our guys more than somebody else.

481
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:25,390
That isn't all right. You know, we're going to do that.

482
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:35,800
I mean, one of the things that I didn't get right now.

483
01:06:36,820 --> 01:06:47,280
You know, I believe, like when you take a three hour to get out of that, you have a good chance.

484
01:06:47,890 --> 01:06:51,970
It's on Friday. Harry's house is over now.

485
01:06:51,980 --> 01:06:58,900
So, yeah, I have one of my best friends must tell Rutgers Law School and that campus.

486
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:04,840
It's like a half hour out of the city just like this, right? Yeah.

487
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:08,360
Why don't we get him in her place, right?

488
01:07:08,980 --> 01:07:14,200
Because she has close friends on a day like Thursday.

489
01:07:14,260 --> 01:07:19,930
Hey, look, when it comes to Taylor Swift, that's not live.

490
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:24,580
It's Josie Taylor and Olivia Rodrigo.

491
01:07:25,650 --> 01:07:31,580
I mean, don't you have to pay like that? It's like, how do you know? I don't know.

492
01:07:31,810 --> 01:07:37,640
I'm like, I should do this. I do have the fear, so I'm excited for you.

493
01:07:37,660 --> 01:07:43,420
How are you going to put your name? I don't know.

494
01:07:43,510 --> 01:07:49,690
I mean, I'm I'm not like a guy, so I invited some people from outside.

495
01:07:50,210 --> 01:07:59,680
Pretty? Yeah. I don't know if our childhood is inside the house.

496
01:08:00,220 --> 01:08:05,750
It's not okay, isn't it? Is that an idea?

497
01:08:05,770 --> 01:08:17,730
But there's also this came out was like and you just don't know where.

498
01:08:20,390 --> 01:08:26,050
I feel like Joe, I have no idea to go. And I was like, you know, we're missing.

499
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:31,110
I lost one of her eyes, and she was right there.

500
01:08:31,150 --> 01:08:51,020
Right. She was just trying to just be like, you know, you want to be my parents.

501
01:08:51,030 --> 01:08:57,580
So I know you could do something.

502
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:13,030
Let me get your particulars and come back.

503
01:09:13,350 --> 01:09:19,990
You put that as quantities of value this year.

504
01:09:21,940 --> 01:09:26,810
It's a lot of open house.

505
01:09:26,820 --> 01:09:33,360
And I see you accept income inequality as a binary.

506
01:09:35,270 --> 01:09:43,850
Yes. The two different steps have come to that.

507
01:09:43,970 --> 01:09:47,360
Well, thank you for all your help. No problem.

508
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:56,130
You already had more. The third one.

509
01:09:59,070 --> 01:10:05,670
I think they just honest for fun. He said that it meant that one at the median income income inequality.

510
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:11,110
So you say it was the president talking. I know.

511
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:16,200
Well, it's disappeared. I feel so bad.

512
01:10:17,370 --> 01:10:20,740
What should I do with these? I keep them still.

513
01:10:22,110 --> 01:10:25,470
Just in case. Just in case. Okay. So we distribute. Yeah.

514
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:30,340
Okay. I thought that for me.

515
01:10:32,010 --> 01:10:35,820
Try to be a little more electronic. But that might be your octopuses.

516
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:40,680
Absolutely not. Until sucking up to a point, you would have a chase down.

517
01:10:40,710 --> 01:10:45,000
Yeah, people. Yeah. Now you have that. You trying to help this man?

518
01:10:45,150 --> 01:10:49,480
I mean, it's like she's making a take the job for me.

519
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:56,450
Some kind of euros for the rest of the year. So you can write.

520
01:10:57,350 --> 01:11:02,400
Pretty quickly that we got to clean off the mind.

521
01:11:02,430 --> 01:11:07,920
Yeah. Any more requests coming in, then? No, I'm not even sure what to say.

522
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:11,790
Yeah. Yeah, well, I thought this cuts a bigger deal, but that's not like.

523
01:11:11,790 --> 01:11:16,300
That's not why I got it. Sure.

524
01:11:16,590 --> 01:11:19,940
That going to see it said. Yeah.

525
01:11:21,510 --> 01:11:25,950
Okay. Well, have a good weekend. Yes, I'll see you next week.

526
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:32,330
Okay. I would like you back at your best.

527
01:11:32,490 --> 01:11:35,760
Yes. Okay. Thank you. I'm sorry we get you to.

528
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:41,790
Did you get for. Make sure I took some notes.

529
01:11:41,850 --> 01:11:52,410
They just don't make any sense. Oh, great. And then so I said, but secondly, this piece control study again original spreadsheet.

530
01:11:55,170 --> 01:11:58,740
Why do I have to work? Number five? Yeah.

531
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:05,590
We think this summer maybe it was cohort. You stay on at the end when you were still talking.

532
01:12:05,650 --> 01:12:06,850
What do you think? Okay.

533
01:12:06,940 --> 01:12:12,219
He was saying it was cohort because someone asked him as a case control and they said there a reason to think it is going to be true.

534
01:12:12,220 --> 01:12:15,790
And I'm like, That's a weird way to say no. He's a what?

535
01:12:15,790 --> 01:12:18,909
He said he was like, Is there a reason to think it will be case control?

536
01:12:18,910 --> 01:12:23,330
I'm like, or I was, yeah, I'm like that. I think that is.

537
01:12:23,530 --> 01:12:34,190
Why did he say it was cohort and. Let me go look and see if I can remember because it is under retrospective right now.

538
01:12:36,350 --> 01:12:37,430
So we have to put that on them.

539
01:12:37,970 --> 01:12:44,670
I think they said they thought it was case control because they assumed that all these results were having it at one time.

540
01:12:44,740 --> 01:12:48,410
Yeah, but he said if it was a case control, they would call it a case control.

541
01:12:49,220 --> 01:12:55,070
But I know what the [INAUDIBLE] are you told in the first name examined in a case control study?

542
01:12:55,080 --> 01:13:00,020
But it's not always going to tell you. So that's why it's like they didn't say that it was.

543
01:13:01,250 --> 01:13:06,810
Yeah, because everyone's was like, so for it to be case control, if something has to happen, like over the span of one day.

544
01:13:06,830 --> 01:13:10,880
Like, how does it work? I don't think you should be.

545
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:14,450
I think they need to maintain.

546
01:13:18,690 --> 01:13:23,870
So the outcome is pretty was just say outcome confirms the school exposure to

547
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:27,930
childhood lead exposure and is supported variables such as age kids or kids.

548
01:13:29,530 --> 01:13:33,760
This class, I really should test it out like I was going to try and do it.

549
01:13:33,950 --> 01:13:37,389
Yeah, and I'm good. I know how that is. That's why I didn't do it.

550
01:13:37,390 --> 01:13:39,430
I was like, I was thinking, I can use the refresh fund.

551
01:13:39,430 --> 01:13:46,450
Like, maybe we won't be like actually going over to this, but I'm like, this is, that is just not where he needs to be.

552
01:13:46,450 --> 01:13:52,450
Like, we need to be doing maybe we should ask like I was going to ask on the can we not do that?

553
01:13:52,450 --> 01:13:57,700
Because even if it were for other people, it might not work for this class because everybody's confused, represented like I don't know.

554
01:13:57,970 --> 01:14:01,720
Yeah, I was confused. When you start going through the slides, I'm like, So why did I spend so much time?

555
01:14:02,110 --> 01:14:08,469
I think he was low yesterday, so I think he wants us to go to a before so we can get, diagnose,

556
01:14:08,470 --> 01:14:14,980
get understanding and take the quiz and then when go to class, he just skipped it because he didn't take time out.

557
01:14:14,980 --> 01:14:18,879
So I think that's what he wants us to do. But I don't think he should do that.

558
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:26,350
I think he we should be taking. Oh, no, I'm breaking up like one oh class on Monday.

559
01:14:26,590 --> 01:14:31,530
We do no selection dinner and always there we do projects.

560
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:35,900
Yeah, that's. Shoot, that would be nice. I'm.

561
01:14:39,790 --> 01:14:43,250
I think some.

562
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:48,669
I need us to go over one more time. Even though I still want to look it over myself.

563
01:14:48,670 --> 01:14:55,130
So I understand the how I'm doing. Good. I'm keeping it brief.

564
01:14:55,270 --> 01:15:00,540
Or go down the hill by the door. Oh, that was like your parallel parking.

565
01:15:00,550 --> 01:15:04,750
I'm not used to going on in part by the others. Like right close by.

566
01:15:05,150 --> 01:15:08,190
Yup. I part. I was like street parking in L.A.

567
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:11,890
I'm already running late. I found a spot right in front.

568
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:15,100
I walk out the doors and you look down my car right here. What is?

569
01:15:16,830 --> 01:15:28,700
I got more classes today other than my opportunity and 1123 So over yesterday where we take all the same classes, are you taking 630?

570
01:15:29,780 --> 01:15:34,399
Yes, I'm asking me. I was looking, I was like, yeah, both classes at 230.

571
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:38,360
We're all in the same in like, yo, I'm like I was like 630.

572
01:15:38,870 --> 01:15:43,250
Are you not taking the epidemiologically? No, I'm only taking 13 credits.

573
01:15:43,270 --> 01:15:48,230
Suppose you know the epidemiology class really heavy. Like I might have to drop this one.

574
01:15:48,470 --> 01:15:53,320
Epidemiology? I'm taking that next semester, which is like. It was copies of the.

575
01:15:55,020 --> 01:15:58,440
I can't do that. Your bio says it's not up to us.

576
01:15:58,850 --> 01:16:02,969
Yeah, and I'm taking physics. You go and visit.

577
01:16:02,970 --> 01:16:11,280
Girl was a girl. That's gross. You want to organize your show on one of my lines just mentioned going.

578
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:15,600
I just feel kind of old. I was late and then I have to work.

579
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:18,650
I close. So I get out. I like something. I'm not driving.

580
01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:22,370
Hope they still don't have an after party. Yeah.

581
01:16:22,980 --> 01:16:28,010
Just leave it. Write about it. I'm gonna new here and I'm just me.

582
01:16:29,310 --> 01:16:34,170
I'm the reason I'm doing it. I'm going to some mariachi. I was like, yeah, I'll be there meeting.

583
01:16:34,170 --> 01:16:38,270
Right. I can't say it. I feel like we're making a struggle.

584
01:16:38,290 --> 01:16:45,299
You know, my time has come to go make it happen.

585
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:49,770
We argue it's our Chapter ten, September 29th.

586
01:16:50,070 --> 01:16:53,450
You know what? Yeah, I'm going to support him. I can't be graduated.

587
01:16:53,460 --> 01:16:57,020
Right? He is like Alexa.

588
01:16:57,270 --> 01:17:00,860
You don't have rhythm anyway. I like, you know, be strong.

589
01:17:01,170 --> 01:17:08,370
I do. Maybe the minute they force me to middle to get. Religious Americans.

590
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:17,790
Come on. Do what you're gonna do. Just admit this boy, because I don't feel like doing this number.

591
01:17:17,980 --> 01:17:21,330
I'm, like, really gonna suck on it.

592
01:17:22,650 --> 01:17:25,990
Yeah. And then I don't want to do it. And then he. Oh, you wanna go over the answers?

593
01:17:26,430 --> 01:17:29,510
What? I don't think you should do that.

594
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:33,270
Because if it's submitted, when is due? Tomorrow night at noon.

595
01:17:33,750 --> 01:17:39,540
Oh, wait. Oh, yeah. And it's like 12 instead of Limpia, the 9 a.m. and noon.

596
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:47,730
Well, then you might listen to me because I'm going to be only in class.

597
01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:51,450
Sure. Okay. I'm sorry.

598
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:55,550
I mean, when you start over the number to state the outcome.

599
01:17:55,560 --> 01:17:59,500
What exposure? Oh, something. So you want not to want.

600
01:18:00,060 --> 01:18:04,410
I just want to make sure I have a way to write. Because I was taking notes on what they said. Urban neighborhood.

601
01:18:06,780 --> 01:18:11,560
We're in the urban neighborhood. That's why.

602
01:18:13,770 --> 01:18:18,840
That could be that could be a supporting variable because I said New York City neighborhood.

603
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:23,250
So that's like urban neighborhoods. New York City is urban, right?

604
01:18:23,970 --> 01:18:27,450
I think so, yeah. The urban neighborhoods.

605
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:36,740
Indeed we do. When is it? Thursday.

606
01:18:37,130 --> 01:18:41,020
I think it's like nine, eight, eight. But what is?

607
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:49,260
Are you serious? Next Thursday. So Wednesday we'll be talking about how to do that with.

608
01:18:52,150 --> 01:18:59,490
We're gonna get started on the turkey.

609
01:19:00,750 --> 01:19:05,110
It's my last question. I'm taking a nice, little long weekend.

610
01:19:06,490 --> 01:19:13,990
I have two classes tomorrow. I'm going to talk private, but I know you know.

611
01:19:14,170 --> 01:19:18,220
So now you have. Right now, I've never had this moment.

612
01:19:19,030 --> 01:19:33,160
Yeah. Really? Yeah. Do. Looking at this five, four, six, three.

613
01:19:33,610 --> 01:19:37,800
See four questions answers different section on proposing.

614
01:19:38,620 --> 01:19:44,650
Indulging in an indulgence, I want to ask, what are you interested in?

615
01:19:45,270 --> 01:19:54,700
You know, I'm really trying to figure that out, as she says about aging and aging.

616
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:58,010
Is your take on Linda? Yeah, I think so.

617
01:19:58,030 --> 01:20:07,900
Oh, that's my advice. Yeah. Let me see Linda. But she had an Asian and she married like, well, I want to make into the screening.

618
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:11,620
Right. I want to see the faces. Okay. All right.

619
01:20:12,670 --> 01:20:17,110
What's your favorite summer? Let me know if there's Linda.

620
01:20:17,770 --> 01:20:21,250
Probably just nice woman. I sleep.

621
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:40,190
Kathleen. Kathleen Oh, that's the one who was talking about autumn animals orientation.

622
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:43,790
She not a dog. Barks at the.

623
01:20:52,110 --> 01:20:55,650
You said there's a good chance.

624
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:09,530
I'm debating not have time to go.

625
01:21:21,610 --> 01:21:25,720
Citizen. Oh, wait a minute.

626
01:21:27,460 --> 01:21:30,730
This guy must be locked now. Out would love.

627
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:33,910
What the [INAUDIBLE] did I sign up for? We're talking about getting sleep in [INAUDIBLE].

628
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:42,000
I said please get yourself together. She was asking questions on the reading.

629
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,030
I'm like, I need to read it. Oh, yeah, I'm looking. I'm sorry.

630
01:21:45,150 --> 01:21:49,950
I'm reading. I say, Gosh, she said she was gonna do that.

631
01:21:50,580 --> 01:21:53,620
I read the little introductory statement thing. That's it.

632
01:21:55,870 --> 01:22:32,730
I was scrolling through my new ship, never ending. What's one thing you have to get out of the course?

633
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:36,720
I don't know. Only.

634
01:23:04,310 --> 01:23:09,440
And then he got this [INAUDIBLE] to be what you call it.

635
01:23:10,680 --> 01:23:14,600
Do people know why is uploading this [INAUDIBLE]?

636
01:23:16,380 --> 01:23:24,740
I'll wait three. I have no idea what I'm going to answer to my class.

637
01:23:24,980 --> 01:23:34,950
Like, I can't even. Maybe I did say I learned more about brain health in dementia.

638
01:23:38,030 --> 01:23:41,060
I don't know. And I just feel like anything I say can be done.

639
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:47,830
It's like I said, it's like the Chinese in Beijing order.

640
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:52,550
Which based. You only submit this once.

641
01:23:54,060 --> 01:24:00,770
No, I'm not gonna do it. I need to.

642
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:05,860
I think it's loaded. See, it says try again. I think you.

643
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:14,770
Oh, yeah. This is a movie. I showed you a preview.

644
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:24,730
What you did was nice. It seems my right to me, buddy.

645
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:38,360
I guess the second worst part.
