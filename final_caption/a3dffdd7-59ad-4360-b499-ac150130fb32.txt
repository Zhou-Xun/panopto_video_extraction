1
00:00:05,295 --> 00:00:10,295
discussing methods to calculate risk. So on Tuesday session, in addition

2
00:00:10,295 --> 00:00:15,295
to learning about basic measures of disease, we learned about incidents and the concept of person

3
00:00:15,295 --> 00:00:20,295
time. We did some examples of calculating person time, and we learned two

4
00:00:20,295 --> 00:00:25,295
methods to calculate risk. The first was the simple cumulative risk method, which gives

5
00:00:25,295 --> 00:00:30,295
us the incidence proportion also referred to as the cumulative incidents. And we learned the

6
00:00:30,295 --> 00:00:35,295
actuarial or life table method to calculate risk. The simple cumulative

7
00:00:35,295 --> 00:00:41,295
risk method works really well when we have full, complete follow up on our total population.

8
00:00:41,295 --> 00:00:47,295
And there is no withdrawal over the study follow up period, which is often an unrealistic

9
00:00:47,295 --> 00:00:52,295
assumption. The life table method works well when we have intervals of follow

10
00:00:52,295 --> 00:00:58,295
up and we're not entirely sure exactly when disease cases occur or withdrawals

11
00:00:58,295 --> 00:01:03,295
from the study or population occur within each given interval. We will

12
00:01:03,295 --> 00:01:08,295
now move on to the incidence density method, which is often preferred over the simple cumulative

13
00:01:08,295 --> 00:01:14,295
risk method or life table method. When the data that we have available allows us to calculate

14
00:01:14,295 --> 00:01:19,295
in risk based on the incidence density.

15
00:01:19,295 --> 00:01:24,295
So let's suppose we have a closed cohort or population with an incidents

16
00:01:24,295 --> 00:01:30,295
rate that is small of the outcome defined here as less than 10 percent

17
00:01:30,295 --> 00:01:35,295
and constant within each follow up interval. This formula

18
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:40,295
gives us the overall risk over the entire follow up interval defined

19
00:01:40,295 --> 00:01:45,295
here as R hat over the period T naught through to T. And we use the

20
00:01:45,295 --> 00:01:51,295
incidence density to calculate this risk. So R hat

21
00:01:51,295 --> 00:01:56,295
over T naught through to T in here is equal to one minus N

22
00:01:56,295 --> 00:02:01,295
t prime, divided by N naught prime. So N t prime is the expected

23
00:02:01,295 --> 00:02:07,295
number of individuals who are disease free at the end of follow up time, divided

24
00:02:07,295 --> 00:02:12,295
by N naught prime, wich is the number of disease free individuals at the start of the follow up

25
00:02:12,295 --> 00:02:17,295
period, t naught. Please note that N t prime over N naught prime

26
00:02:17,295 --> 00:02:22,295
prime is the survival proportion. And this will make sense later on.

27
00:02:22,295 --> 00:02:27,295
This simplifies to using the incidence density as one minus the exponent

28
00:02:27,295 --> 00:02:32,295
of a negative incidence density multiplied by the length of time elapsed between

29
00:02:32,295 --> 00:02:37,295
the start of the followup interval and the end of the followup interval, recalling that incidence

30
00:02:37,295 --> 00:02:43,295
density is simply the number of new cases that occur in an interval divided by the total

31
00:02:43,295 --> 00:02:48,295
person time at risk that has contributed during that interval. This formula is

32
00:02:48,295 --> 00:02:53,295
also referred to as the exponential formula in modern epidemiology. And if this is confusing

33
00:02:53,295 --> 00:02:59,295
or feels like a lot, I know it definitely feels like a lot to me when I just look at this slide

34
00:02:59,295 --> 00:03:04,295
straight out of nowhere. Don't worry. We're going to work through an example here in this recording, as well

35
00:03:04,295 --> 00:03:09,295
as in small groups during the class session. So the incidence

36
00:03:09,295 --> 00:03:14,295
density method for estimating risk is actually really useful because when we have

37
00:03:14,295 --> 00:03:20,295
a closed population, assuming that the incidence density is constant over time,

38
00:03:20,295 --> 00:03:25,295
the relationship between the length of the follow up interval delta and risk is actually

39
00:03:25,295 --> 00:03:30,295
exponential and not linear. So we see exponential decay in the size of the

40
00:03:30,295 --> 00:03:35,295
cohort as and as time goes on. And the incidence density method allows

41
00:03:35,295 --> 00:03:41,295
us to account for this. So let's work through an example

42
00:03:41,295 --> 00:03:46,295
in the image on the left hand side of the slide. We have follow up time in years for a total

43
00:03:46,295 --> 00:03:51,295
of five years on the Y axis on the left hand side. We have seven subjects

44
00:03:51,295 --> 00:03:56,295
who are followed for varying amounts of time over the five years of follow up.

45
00:03:56,295 --> 00:04:01,295
Some are living with the disease indicated by the solid line and would not be considered

46
00:04:01,295 --> 00:04:07,295
at risk or contributing person. Time to the follow up. And some are living without

47
00:04:07,295 --> 00:04:12,295
disease. Over the follow up indicated by the dashed line, indicating that they are at risk

48
00:04:12,295 --> 00:04:18,295
of developing the disease and are contributing person time. The Y axis for convenience

49
00:04:18,295 --> 00:04:23,295
indicates the total amount or duration of person time at risk contributed

50
00:04:23,295 --> 00:04:29,295
by each of the seven individuals. So the first thing that we do is calculate

51
00:04:29,295 --> 00:04:34,295
the incidence density over the total follow up interval. And here we're using the total

52
00:04:34,295 --> 00:04:39,295
five years. So we have ID over the period zero through five.

53
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:44,295
Please note that incidence density is the same thing as incidence rate here. So the incidence

54
00:04:44,295 --> 00:04:49,295
density is three divided by 13. This is because we have three cases,

55
00:04:49,295 --> 00:04:55,295
which are subjects four, five and seven over a total person time at risk

56
00:04:55,295 --> 00:05:00,295
of follow up of 13 years, which you can readily see if you just add up the total

57
00:05:00,295 --> 00:05:05,295
follow up time represented by the dashed lines. And this corresponds to

58
00:05:05,295 --> 00:05:10,295
a risk of 68.5 percent when we apply that incidence density

59
00:05:10,295 --> 00:05:16,295
formula. However, the incidence rates for most

60
00:05:16,295 --> 00:05:21,295
diseases actually vary over time. And so in the previous example, we assumed

61
00:05:21,295 --> 00:05:27,295
that the incidence rate or incidence density was constant over the five year period of follow up.

62
00:05:27,295 --> 00:05:32,295
And this may or may not be a strong assumption. Typically, the longer that interval of follow

63
00:05:32,295 --> 00:05:37,295
up, the less likely the constant rate assumption is to hold and to address this potential

64
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:43,295
problem. We can divide the overall time interval delta into smaller intervals

65
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:49,295
denoted by delta j. Please note that here in this example, we will refer to intervals

66
00:05:49,295 --> 00:05:54,295
in terms of calendar time. But we can also conceptualize time as age.

67
00:05:54,295 --> 00:05:59,295
So in other words, rather than using time as the time scale, we can use age as the time

68
00:05:59,295 --> 00:06:05,295
scale. And this is really useful for some disease outcomes. So, for example,

69
00:06:05,295 --> 00:06:10,295
we we may see increased risk of a given outcome with increasing age. And

70
00:06:10,295 --> 00:06:15,295
in fact, accelerated risk as age linearly increases. This is definitely true

71
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:20,295
for dementia, where age begins to increase the. Sorry, the risk of dementia begins

72
00:06:20,295 --> 00:06:25,295
to increase exponentially beyond age 75. In this case, we would want to use a time

73
00:06:25,295 --> 00:06:31,295
stratified density method in order to estimate the incidence of dementia with increasing age.

74
00:06:31,295 --> 00:06:36,295
But here and throughout the rest of this recording, we will think about stratifying intervals according to

75
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:43,295
calendar time rather than age. Just recall that it is possible to do this using age as well.

76
00:06:43,295 --> 00:06:48,295
And this is what this looks like. So here in this example, we have a total follow

77
00:06:48,295 --> 00:06:53,295
up of four years. But we divide it out into yearly intervals from tea, not all the way

78
00:06:53,295 --> 00:07:00,295
through to tea four, which gives us four intervals denoted by J.

79
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:06,295
And what does the formula look like for the time stratified incidents, density method? What's actually

80
00:07:06,295 --> 00:07:11,295
very similar to the original incidence density method that I showed you a few slides

81
00:07:11,295 --> 00:07:16,295
ago? Now, we denote risk from t naught over through to t

82
00:07:16,295 --> 00:07:21,295
j. And we simply take the incidence density for a specific interval

83
00:07:21,295 --> 00:07:26,295
j multiplied by the duration of that specific interval j. And we

84
00:07:26,295 --> 00:07:31,295
add them up over the total number of intervals. Again, if this seems confusing.

85
00:07:31,295 --> 00:07:38,295
Don't worry. We'll work through an example together in this recording as well as in small groups.

86
00:07:38,295 --> 00:07:44,295
So let's return to our example that we looked at earlier in this session

87
00:07:44,295 --> 00:07:49,295
with the seven subjects who are followed up over a period of five years. So rather than

88
00:07:49,295 --> 00:07:54,295
using five years as the total follow up time interval, we are now going to stratify

89
00:07:54,295 --> 00:07:59,295
this into five year long intervals over the total five year follow

90
00:07:59,295 --> 00:08:04,295
up time. So, again, the first thing we do is we calculate the incidence

91
00:08:04,295 --> 00:08:10,295
density for the first interval, which here is not to one, so year zero to

92
00:08:10,295 --> 00:08:15,295
year one. There is one case of the disease over

93
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:20,295
this time interval. And that is subject five. As you can see, denoted by the X for that individual.

94
00:08:20,295 --> 00:08:26,295
And there is a total of 4.5 years of person time at risk. Contributed by the seven

95
00:08:26,295 --> 00:08:31,295
subjects over this one year interval. And again, you can readily figure that out by

96
00:08:31,295 --> 00:08:36,295
adding up the total time contributed by the dashed lines. This gives us an incidence density

97
00:08:36,295 --> 00:08:41,295
of 0.222 for the first interval. A really

98
00:08:41,295 --> 00:08:47,295
nice way to calculate this out is to make a table where we have each of the intervals indicated

99
00:08:47,295 --> 00:08:52,295
by the rows. And so we may want to put the overall incidence denoted here as

100
00:08:52,295 --> 00:08:57,295
Ij for each interval in one column. The person time contributed for interval

101
00:08:57,295 --> 00:09:03,295
j in the next column. And then and so on. We can calculate the incidence density

102
00:09:03,295 --> 00:09:09,295
for each interval j, based on Ij divided by PTj

103
00:09:09,295 --> 00:09:15,295
And let's do that here for the next interval. So the incidence density from interval

104
00:09:15,295 --> 00:09:20,295
from the year one to year two is actually zero. And this is because, as you can see,

105
00:09:20,295 --> 00:09:26,295
there are zero cases of the disease over this interval denoted by no X is occurring.

106
00:09:26,295 --> 00:09:32,295
And there was a total of three point five person years. But it actually doesn't matter because there were zero cases.

107
00:09:32,295 --> 00:09:37,295
Let's come back to the table. So we write down the incidence density for the second interval

108
00:09:37,295 --> 00:09:42,295
denoted by one two in the table. And we can keep going down

109
00:09:42,295 --> 00:09:48,295
through the rows to calculate the incidence density for a given interval j.

110
00:09:48,295 --> 00:09:53,295
We can then calculate the risk for that interval, j,

111
00:09:53,295 --> 00:09:58,295
using that density formula, which I've shown again here. So

112
00:09:58,295 --> 00:10:03,295
we end up with a risk for the first interval, naught to one, of 0.199.

113
00:10:03,295 --> 00:10:09,295
And we can do this the whole way through

114
00:10:09,295 --> 00:10:14,295
that column across each interval. We can then estimate

115
00:10:14,295 --> 00:10:19,295
the cumulative risk, which is the final column in the table as R hat

116
00:10:19,295 --> 00:10:24,295
from t naught through to tj. And ultimately, we end

117
00:10:24,295 --> 00:10:30,295
up with a risk, a cumulative risk of 0.463 by the end of the

118
00:10:30,295 --> 00:10:35,295
third interval. So from t naught to t three. And then

119
00:10:35,295 --> 00:10:40,295
we do this again for the total time period and we end up with a cumulative risk

120
00:10:40,295 --> 00:10:46,295
from t naught through to t five of 0.724 or 72.4%.

121
00:10:46,295 --> 00:10:51,295
And note here that we're estimating the risk. And this is

122
00:10:51,295 --> 00:10:56,295
a proportion. But in doing so, we are using the incidence density, which is a rate

123
00:10:56,295 --> 00:11:01,295
in order to calculate the risk as a proportion over a total follow up period.

124
00:11:01,295 --> 00:11:07,295
And using the rates allows us to take into account that there are varying amounts of person time contributed

125
00:11:07,295 --> 00:11:12,295
by the individuals in the population. So let's quickly

126
00:11:12,295 --> 00:11:17,295
review some key assumptions of the incidence density method. So

127
00:11:17,295 --> 00:11:22,295
we assume that each time specific or age specific incidents, rate or incidence

128
00:11:22,295 --> 00:11:28,295
density is constant over the entire interval. And this may or may not be biologically

129
00:11:28,295 --> 00:11:33,295
plausible. The smaller the interval, the more likely it is that the incidence

130
00:11:33,295 --> 00:11:38,295
rate is, in truth, constant over the entire interval. When we use

131
00:11:38,295 --> 00:11:44,295
age as the time scale, we are also assuming that each age specific instant

132
00:11:44,295 --> 00:11:49,295
incidence rate is constant over calendar time. In other words, we are assuming

133
00:11:49,295 --> 00:11:54,295
that the incidence rate, when the observations are made, are the same as it was for that specific

134
00:11:54,295 --> 00:12:00,295
age group in the past. And this may even be decades earlier. So we are assuming that

135
00:12:00,295 --> 00:12:05,295
there are no secular trends in the incidence rate. Sorry, no secular trends

136
00:12:05,295 --> 00:12:10,295
in the age-specific incidence rate. The incidence density

137
00:12:10,295 --> 00:12:15,295
method also assumes that the incidence is small. And this is what allows us to doexponentiation

138
00:12:15,295 --> 00:12:20,295
within the formula. However, we can actually force this assumption to hold

139
00:12:20,295 --> 00:12:25,295
by splitting time into very small intervals such that there are few cases of the disease

140
00:12:25,295 --> 00:12:31,295
occurring within a given interval. The incidence

141
00:12:31,295 --> 00:12:36,295
density method also assumes that we are working with a closed population and it assumes that there

142
00:12:36,295 --> 00:12:41,295
are no competing risks. In other words, it assumes that there are no other

143
00:12:41,295 --> 00:12:47,295
outcomes that happen that prevent or preclude the outcome. Under a study from happening

144
00:12:47,295 --> 00:12:53,295
and we can address competing risks using survival analysis methods, these are more advanced and complex

145
00:12:53,295 --> 00:12:58,295
than what we're getting into here. And this is addressed later in the semester.

146
00:12:58,295 --> 00:13:03,295
And that's it for part one, the next is part five, in which we will discuss the Kaplan-Meier

147
00:13:03,295 --> 00:13:07,232
product limit method to estimate risk.
