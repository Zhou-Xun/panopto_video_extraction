1
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,077
So how can we use some of the tools we've discussed to handle

2
00:00:13,077 --> 00:00:16,340
a smoker who is not quite ready to quit.

3
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:22,041
Let's take a look, today we're gonna practice using reflective

4
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:29,140
listening to handle content of a smoker who's not quite ready to quit.

5
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:40,775
Well let's take a look at our first case, please read the patient's statement.

6
00:00:40,775 --> 00:00:42,169
Go ahead and write out or

7
00:00:42,169 --> 00:00:56,340
make a mental note of a reflection you might use with this patient statement.

8
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,803
Great, now let's take a look at some possible reflections.

9
00:01:00,803 --> 00:01:04,959
I'm pretty sure most of you got at least two of these.

10
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:09,563
Given you are coughing up all the time, you are starting to get worried that maybe

11
00:01:09,563 --> 00:01:12,418
what's happened to your dad is happening to you.

12
00:01:12,418 --> 00:01:15,874
Notice the tentative language starting to get worried,

13
00:01:15,874 --> 00:01:19,340
that's gonna be a theme for the remainder of our course.

14
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:24,126
Tentative language, moving towards thinking about considering because if you

15
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:28,290
remember, if we overstate their readiness we can create reactants.

16
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:32,633
And the second one you're scared smoking has finally caught up to you.

17
00:01:32,633 --> 00:01:37,310
We're now inferring a feeling, he doesn't directly say scared but

18
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:42,483
it's a very logical inference that we will test with a feeling reflection.

19
00:01:42,483 --> 00:01:46,607
And finally all that stuff coming up has been a wakeup call,

20
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:52,153
sort of making a little bit of a poetic metaphoric interpretation of his story.

21
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:58,589
Now let's take a look at a slightly different case,

22
00:01:58,589 --> 00:02:06,454
so please read this patient statement.

23
00:02:06,454 --> 00:02:11,214
Write out your reflection or

24
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:17,381
reflections, And

25
00:02:17,381 --> 00:02:22,380
what we can see here it's pretty heavy resistance,

26
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:30,340
not a lot of change that's here to wakeup call.

27
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,880
Okay, let's take a look at some possible reflections.

28
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:37,205
Now there's gonna be two types here, there's gonna be traditional rolling with

29
00:02:37,205 --> 00:02:40,601
resistance and then we're gonna use some amplified negative.

30
00:02:40,601 --> 00:02:43,740
Let's start with the traditional rolling of the resistance.

31
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:47,840
Your experience has been that smoking is not as bad as the experts say.

32
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,955
Your friends and family have not generally gotten sick from it,

33
00:02:50,955 --> 00:02:53,440
you see little reason to quit.

34
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,850
Now let's use two amplified reflections, it's something you're going to do for

35
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,230
the rest of your life.

36
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:02,040
I hope you can feel the overstatement there.

37
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,500
Similarly, look at the overstatement in the next one,

38
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,640
you see no benefit whatsoever in quitting in amplified negative.

39
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,181
The goal there is to get him to bounce and

40
00:03:11,181 --> 00:03:14,240
go in the opposite direction not to agree with it.

41
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:18,246
The bottom two relate to the final statement from the client where he was

42
00:03:18,246 --> 00:03:21,383
sort of expressing his hesitance to be told what to do and

43
00:03:21,383 --> 00:03:24,900
doesn't like how health professionals exaggerate things.

44
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:29,024
So here's two reflections, you're worried I'm gonna exaggerate things to get you to

45
00:03:29,024 --> 00:03:34,140
try and quit or doctors in general exaggerate the harm of smoking.

46
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:38,029
We hope you see in these two cases, how you can imply certain skills such as

47
00:03:38,029 --> 00:03:41,321
rolling with resistance and amplify negative reflections.

48
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:46,927
To help with ambivalent smokers or smokers who are not yet ready to quit.
