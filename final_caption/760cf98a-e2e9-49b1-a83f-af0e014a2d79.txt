1
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:12,870
They would have to they were going to this class basically to have a discussion,

2
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:19,979
this conversation between you and between you and me, also between you about this video.

3
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,240
About every semester meets a plan. I hope that you'll watch that.

4
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:28,499
I found it very beautiful. I. Every year i.

5
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,310
Because every day they change that. It will be the videos.

6
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:41,910
I have watched this particular topic in previous years but the for this year was I know there presented a very beautiful very informative.

7
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:57,130
De la. And it very interesting because usually we have these big plans, but we want to do it in there for them.

8
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,240
If they're doing that, they want to write these babies away.

9
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:10,540
Went through that is the gates. You might want to write the book. But not only are we going to to do something we need.

10
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:19,020
I know we need to make our goal. And then there were very specific steps that what we need to resolve here.

11
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:28,530
Okay, then this is not a discussion. The and feel free to tell anyone what you think would be the beginning of what you support, what was presented.

12
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,559
Please. I just thought it was very interesting that, like you said, we have a very big plan,

13
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:42,570
but we don't really know the steps to take or how long each step actually takes and how many people think.

14
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,940
And so, like you said, writing a book, you need to have an outline to that.

15
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:52,319
And how long that went even takes is different and then what the content is and then review.

16
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:58,820
And then it's just so that. And if we don't actually have a timeline of when it's going to get done, it's likely get done.

17
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:05,970
It's the truth. Do you really like the concept of unstructured time versus free time?

18
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:12,490
That was quite useful. Yeah. It's a tough time you had with the day.

19
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:17,249
Yeah, I do have some free time where I can.

20
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,330
We know any, um. You can. You can.

21
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:31,030
I can submit it. Well, I and I think you've seen that.

22
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:36,450
You've had the. Okay.

23
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:45,580
You know, it's funny that in one word I did not.

24
00:02:52,300 --> 00:03:03,990
Now. How do you learn something useful usefully throughout the years that you are planning to do or do you do because of this class?

25
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:11,990
Yes. But. But actually I applied some of this stuff by some of these technologies when I was doing my masters.

26
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:17,780
You know, I'm doing my page, right? And I had to write my thesis and my thesis.

27
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:25,730
So for me, when I was thinking about writing my thesis, for me it was like some black hole where I should start.

28
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:38,300
But I did this actually, as I outline, like every day I have to work on one step when you have a big project or daily thing to do.

29
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:44,360
If you just get this one start then small steps and finish.

30
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:48,630
Even if you do like one step every day. Main courses.

31
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:54,740
Apply some of just strategies before I got to know your strategy.

32
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:58,489
I know. But it's very useful.

33
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:02,310
And that's how we can meet that line. Especially now. Yeah. Uh.

34
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:19,750
And as you mentioned, a very important point that that we need to be organized to have time for ourselves.

35
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,010
Both if we and I.

36
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:31,740
And I'm going to do this later today or I'm going to do this during the.

37
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:45,550
Then when and what happens, you have a lot of work to do, homework to grade two, gray papers to finish, and there is no time for me.

38
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:48,280
I do not think for me that you not think for my family.

39
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:58,810
Then if we are organized, we are going to have more time for our for our family, for the field that we that we love to do, i.e.

40
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:07,040
If I think to use the Google calendar. Like a couple of years ago.

41
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:10,100
I everything I just put it in a piece of paper.

42
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:19,079
I had this meeting and then I misplaced the paper with this has to do with this critical may I put it in a piece of paper?

43
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:29,610
And then that piece of paper disappeared and now I'm using Google calendar is still I still that didn't

44
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:37,260
tend to be disorganized but I've and again that's something that we need to do as an academic asset.

45
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:41,239
Researchers do need to present you you need to deliver theses.

46
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,980
You are willing to do help on what they are.

47
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:51,380
I strongly advise to follow some of the that in that in the video.

48
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:56,510
Now are you planning to do a plan?

49
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:03,620
Well, you are you did you start to do a plan? Anyone you perform for the whole semester?

50
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:09,020
How oh, let me rephrase this question. How do you plan your plan?

51
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:19,200
Day by day, week by week? And then I felt like there's so much stuff there.

52
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:26,430
Yes. Yes. I feel working in that weekly to weekly plan.

53
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:36,209
I still find her more than a week ahead, but mostly graduate students,

54
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:42,060
because we have most of the deadlines for the projects and the midterms and the exams already.

55
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:49,490
They are on service. So I think we can do multiple. What are the big deadlines that you should meet and what?

56
00:06:56,020 --> 00:07:09,700
If you have that input, I. Related to this planning, how do you happen to use this underestimation of the time that we need to do this task?

57
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,290
Master's thesis and the. On Friday we had like our first meeting with all.

58
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:27,530
Love and war is immature, but the current instruments we're talking about, like the things that they want to do this semester.

59
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:34,910
And I found it really informative that they do not say that many things, like they only have a few I could get done in three or four months.

60
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:40,790
I have no idea how much you could get done in a month or two.

61
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:50,810
Yes. Yeah. Finishing? Mm hmm.

62
00:07:54,430 --> 00:08:11,220
Well for me. And I tried grad school best. I take you on my clients?

63
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:17,640
How many hours I give to those clients in a reasonable week? How much time by for family stuff am I going to host the holidays like?

64
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:45,490
For his or her. So I think we know what that be you hear about in this other in this series of videos from the Faculty Development Center.

65
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:50,230
They decide how to say no, how to learn to say no, because, in fact, we need to say no.

66
00:08:50,630 --> 00:09:04,690
We have not time to do to do that. Also to make priorities are not going to tell you about this underestimation of this on U.S. go the.

67
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:09,430
There aren't proposals for the National Institute of Health.

68
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:21,940
They were the actual research proposals that was 18, 25 pages that wasn't usable 25 years or that researchers may have thought everything,

69
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:32,050
but I think was like a five years ago, maybe a little more, that they changed to only 12 pages.

70
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:41,889
And then you are used to write 25 pages, but I'm proposal and I said no, that's what it was failure there psychologically.

71
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:52,250
I started to say, no, I can do that in half of the time. But I hated it as a two or three month people before the transformation.

72
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,360
But Randy and I'm going to have to do it in a month.

73
00:09:56,450 --> 00:10:03,710
And that was completely false, because now you need to think how you are going to be called due to your need to convince to do.

74
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:10,250
That your research is worthy, that you were able to do it.

75
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:15,440
It's going to have an impact on that one race, and you need to write that in 12 pages.

76
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:19,640
Then it is harder because you need to add.

77
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:23,600
You need to do your research, you need to explain your method,

78
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:35,300
and you are writing for that for researchers that they are not necessarily have that st is very few.

79
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:42,290
They know something about a particular topic but you don't need you don't need to

80
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:46,820
assume that they know everything then you need to explain that with pages then.

81
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:53,300
Yet they did. That was a very hard I thought, you know what, you just have to do time.

82
00:10:53,780 --> 00:11:04,720
My noise. Like the thing I you know, the face now that I really hope that that video was visible for you.

83
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:10,120
And I want to keep working that during this this semester.

84
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:14,650
And I flew it in winter with the second part of this this class.

85
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:18,820
Now, I found these little circle that they have.

86
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:23,800
Okay, this is just my own version about the.

87
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:30,690
What do we need to do? Therefore successful as academics.

88
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:36,130
Now, I also apologize is you noticed that some of the.

89
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:45,750
Examples we're taking from faculty but the students right now by.

90
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:51,240
The examples are getting the tools in the videos and other video.

91
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:54,570
They just take you swimming that you are fighting. But really, we had the same.

92
00:11:55,140 --> 00:12:02,370
Let's say that's easier with the timing, with our planning. Then we need to do this strategic planning.

93
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:06,360
The idea that we're going to have to have this productivity now,

94
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:16,860
we're going to write 100 of papers like them on how we are going to have work life balance and we are going to have a healthy relationship.

95
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:29,850
No, I really di. Um, I think if we, if we don't feel comfortable what we are doing with.

96
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:41,060
Healthy life. If we don't have a support group, family, friends, colleagues, we are not going.

97
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:48,920
Because you cannot think you are distress. You cannot think you have.

98
00:12:49,000 --> 00:13:02,190
Are you I? That is how we are able to control what we can control, what we can control our planning.

99
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:13,169
We can control what we put in. Do you see your research?

100
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:21,350
I can get my papers then. I really hope that we are able to do this now.

101
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:29,680
What are my dates? And these are my own personal dates and feel free to to contradict me or to put you in your view.

102
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:34,880
For me, the more important is the balance.

103
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:49,760
I used IEEE and because this is my own organization, because I tend to be disorganized being so nice.

104
00:13:50,440 --> 00:14:03,480
I feel that I would go back time doing my work. The acting class again in embarrassing face to face.

105
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:12,489
But I feel I don't know if that happens to you. During the pandemia when we were that it was Zoom meetings.

106
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:19,469
So very soon I feel that we were working more time because ah because you come here to the,

107
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:24,660
to classes, to a school like that, you do make this separation in our school.

108
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:36,930
No one. But when we were working up home again, this in my own excellent experience, then it feels like 24 hour was work.

109
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:46,190
It was checking my email. I need to respond. How did you manage to get over it?

110
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:52,960
We are in the process. Maria So I started teleworking in 2019, so before that.

111
00:14:54,520 --> 00:15:01,960
So what I chose to do is have a separate space for my work and everything work related.

112
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:05,500
And that's where my phone was not laying around in the house.

113
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,320
It was in the workspace. It was ringing. I.

114
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:19,400
I think that by closing the door for the day in a very light conscious manner, so that in my mind that part of my day was closed.

115
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:23,130
Yeah, because teleworkers tend to overwork.

116
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:31,500
We feel that we are somehow privileged by working from home, even though we're maintaining an office with our expenses.

117
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:36,540
If. Justify those breaks.

118
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:41,220
And a lot of times snacking is a way to go in order to justify a break.

119
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:51,570
Like I need to eat something. Mm hmm. Yeah. So making a statement and trying to at least get out in the sun for a second during the day.

120
00:15:52,020 --> 00:16:00,450
Those were my. And if that is working will tell you a study requested.

121
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:04,030
Are you receiving any soon? By when? Very soon. The semester.

122
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:10,480
Well. 14 miles Anthony versus 521.

123
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:16,989
Oh I just only Tuesdays and that's my only class on Tuesday but I come to campus for that

124
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:22,650
class so I don't take the class in my apartment and then feel like I have to work all day.

125
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:27,639
Whenever I do any school work throughout the week, I just come to campus to spend as much time as I can.

126
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:36,430
And then when I go back to my apartment, I just calm down. Back to my sister because I'm living with her just kind of like reconnect with my family.

127
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:41,920
Called them. Okay. So, like you said, the separation of recovery person.

128
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:45,489
I have a campus to go to, come here to do my work that I need to.

129
00:16:45,490 --> 00:17:06,070
And then the rest of it is just. I work for my actual clients.

130
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:15,780
4:00 is my dog's afternoon walk. Yeah.

131
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:19,680
Scheduling my book. It's not on the schedule at 5:00.

132
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:26,970
I normally get orientation every time I came in, but she was saying like,

133
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:34,000
you should prioritize your time and be able to say no and nothing can take that time that you have scheduled away from whatever you're doing.

134
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:38,290
I think like for me, I really, I really like to, um.

135
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:40,839
Ah, you like to do puzzles at least for an hour.

136
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:47,889
So my brain is stimulated and then it's not really hard work where I just, it's, I dedicate on the weekend like one hour.

137
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:50,020
I just take a break from whatever I'm doing.

138
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:56,350
Even if somebody calls me during that time, I don't pick up my phone and I just focus on the puzzle, so then just keep my brain stimulated.

139
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:05,390
So I think, like, going. Why start at 4:00?

140
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:14,750
Yeah. And whether we should just get to it.

141
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:20,350
Yeah. We need to protect our own time.

142
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:24,690
And also, um. Um. Yeah.

143
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:28,840
Because if not, I just notice some.

144
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:38,040
Students with the IEEE. Or I used to have these meetings with them.

145
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:43,229
I usually I put an hour, but do it right that you and this guy lets me write it.

146
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:51,710
Then I have to write for all the meetings. But after that, i.e., yes, I saw that.

147
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:55,360
And I want you to read it.

148
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:58,580
And it was nothing really to talk about it.

149
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:08,270
And and the problem was down the river and I was able to talk with one of my students.

150
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:13,040
We finished in 15 minutes, then I have 45 minutes for the next meeting.

151
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:19,520
But then I feel like, okay, you have this time, but you really. I don't know what to do then.

152
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:27,049
Then. Then I ended up doing nothing during the time of reading the news.

153
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:34,470
Or maybe just I just comments on paper, but I felt that there was nothing really that I was doing it at that time then.

154
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:42,440
Now what I am doing is just putting together time for the meetings, just half an hour, half an hour, chunk of time for just within a few days,

155
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:48,799
and is even more productive for me and even for my students, because now they know that they have for me half an hour.

156
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,950
They do need to some time we say we. I went to meet up in an hour.

157
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:57,530
They feel that they have to do this whole presentation to me and need to prepare me for the meeting and to be perfectly stable.

158
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:01,990
But and I am deciding little tips that may be something that we're meeting today.

159
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,300
They don't need to be an hour. Maybe they took our time.

160
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:09,890
We weren't able to do it now. Regarding the goals,

161
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:23,590
what on kingdom I appreciate from that medium dam this character what you have to use specific not only I'm going to publish this book is it?

162
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:30,980
I'm going to write the proposal to write the book or I'm going to submit this paper to these.

163
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:38,690
Thank you. Your now or I want to walk 10,000 steps per day rather than just get fit.

164
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:49,879
Now feel about when you are making goals.

165
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:56,840
Do you make these big goals or now you are trying to be more specific what you want to achieve during.

166
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:05,580
They start with a big goal to achieve and then do like it.

167
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:09,510
But I like the small goals. You just start somewhere?

168
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:18,930
Yeah. We have this big goal at the exact time and they won't make it because it's small steps being more specific.

169
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:24,060
Now these are all the characteristics. They have to be measurable.

170
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:33,090
We need to be able to make sure that we're advancing, that we are advancing our our goals regarding this measure,

171
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:42,880
build a durability characteristic that I found very useful that we need to build some applicability for our self.

172
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:54,000
Because if I say I'm going to write this paper, I need to make sure that I'm working on half an hour to say during the day.

173
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:59,930
Write that page per day, or at least a paragraph. I thought there.

174
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:02,140
Were there some ideas. I don't know.

175
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:11,340
You are using some of those ideas the like because in a class if I ask you, you need to submit this homework for next week.

176
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:17,040
You need to submit it. That's the accountability. Use my department here.

177
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:21,150
Say where you need to the group to write the report. I need to write it.

178
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:29,450
Depending even when these are projects or goals that they have filed timeframe days long.

179
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:35,610
And then we need to keep working in the steps. What kind of accountability do you use?

180
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:45,690
Well, you don't use anything. If I have to book the right lap.

181
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:55,649
And so I usually get my paper with the paper done in advance so I can talk with them right and correct.

182
00:22:55,650 --> 00:23:01,530
And I submit and I also have a person who is on my team that draws illustration.

183
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:10,870
So I promise this week I'm the contents of my book and I make sure they here is a Google drive and get the.

184
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:20,600
The checkpoint every week. So I use other people for my comfortability.

185
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:30,459
There were some ideas, for example, having the police that you meet.

186
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:43,420
Right. I know that these are these. They do it for for writing camp books, I think.

187
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:52,210
In a matter of weeks. The. At the time that you did that and to write with other people.

188
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:57,180
And that's how and that's how. At our own accountability.

189
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:01,799
Now, that depends on you. We are different.

190
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:14,970
We have our own approaches to be accountable for ourself when on again, I strongly recommend doing that because if we don't do that, then we get lost.

191
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:20,100
Then at the end we just see that we have had a little work to finish and then we get crazy.

192
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:25,830
Now another important of my takes the was also in the video.

193
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:29,970
We need to define what needs to be done. How I'm going.

194
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,790
And that's what. Long.

195
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:44,470
But the most important part, because when we need to do all these bullying, all these steps, all these are working in our calendar.

196
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:51,990
Do you do it? I'm going to do that.

197
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:56,700
Your calendar? No. Yes.

198
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:05,070
Because now you see. Although you see my calendar, you see that these different colors during meeting get some little spaces.

199
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:11,360
Yeah. But that the way to do it and that the way to do it is to produce.

200
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:18,980
And you put in the steps in our calendar and then we don't forget because on time also we forget now.

201
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:30,510
That you do to to summarize and again, these are my my own takes.

202
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:36,540
We're going to be watching different videos, different topics during this semester.

203
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:44,830
The important thing that find the work for you. They are maybe some of the idea that they work for you.

204
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:49,870
Maybe you feel comfortable doing things another way. Then find what is work for you.

205
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:56,770
You'll find that you can work with friends, with colleagues, writing to be from that ability to do that.

206
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:07,760
You'll find that may be. In coming here a school De Beers.

207
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:12,530
Rather than staying in your home. Then do that. Then find what works for you.

208
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:18,500
And related to that try to build some accountability to the.

209
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:28,110
The. But. Accountability are more important.

210
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:34,350
Don't forget your life. Uh, Italy.

211
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:39,800
I don't need that. But time we don't get sleep enough.

212
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:46,280
Now that you are in classes. And I imagine that you are going to get less than this hour of sleep.

213
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:51,320
But try to get your healthy out of sleep.

214
00:26:56,130 --> 00:27:02,790
Dedicate time for yourself. The weekends enjoyed the holidays and your friends and your life.

215
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:08,700
And I promise that you are going to get to do great research and you're going to do great research.

216
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:15,540
I also have a dog. I walk my dog when I'm working from home.

217
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:20,040
I walk the dog three times a day, morning, noon and night.

218
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:26,270
Yeah. And now she has to wait.

219
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:34,520
Now that she's working three days, three times a day. Then they say at noon, I got to taking a break.

220
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:41,090
If she goes to my office and just she stared at me and I think, what is going on?

221
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:48,229
I going to work, but not now. But sometime then I walk my dog.

222
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:52,070
I put my my headphones. I give you time to hear music.

223
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:58,430
But maybe some of my best ideas come from this time.

224
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:06,310
This time we, we, our, our mind is not, uh, I, I is not yet thinking in a particular problem,

225
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:13,880
is wondering and then some I feel that some of my best ideas come in this during this time that.

226
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:21,990
They're not doing that. Don't feel that you are wasting time or for taking time for yourself.

227
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:30,880
That is going to help you to be. Ah. To. Lithium comments.

228
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:50,870
No. Okay. Now. Now I'm on the floor for math homework for everyone and only for my state students.

229
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:55,340
For everyone. You need to read these papers. They are in the in the campus side.

230
00:28:55,640 --> 00:29:04,910
But what I was going to say it because my state students, you need to find your the student you have had with your mentor.

231
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:08,389
But you need to work to them to find out research. Even when you had your mentor.

232
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:13,640
But you need to to to decide what is going to be your research for you.

233
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:18,320
There are these couple of papers that are in the campus site.

234
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:26,540
They are they are usually full ideas how to select a mentor, how to select or how to choose our research project.

235
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:36,410
How do we identify the right mentor? And now what I want to ask to let you know, or rather to give this.

236
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:50,390
The advice that the mentor that you are going to choose you need to find out is not going to be only for your disease.

237
00:29:51,440 --> 00:30:00,980
Your mentor is going to be someone that you are going to be dealing with that person for several years during the disease.

238
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:11,899
But even after that, even after you graduate, when after you graduate, you can keep working with your mentor and research your mentor.

239
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:15,080
He's going to write recommendation letter for you.

240
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:23,000
He's going to want to invest in your success.

241
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:30,640
It's want the house has. The.

242
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:36,070
Until your goal to be. It.

243
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:43,560
Then. Then you need to think on your mentor beyond just the particular research that you want to do,

244
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:48,869
because you are going to be someone that is going to be you are going to most likely to be

245
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:53,790
working with your mentor somehow even asking for recommendation made it or doing something

246
00:30:53,790 --> 00:31:00,569
research than this these couple of papers they are very useful in that in that with these

247
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:05,340
ideas are how to do that right better support your research and be ready to discuss.

248
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:14,150
I want to add for I will center now for them because I one for me says to dance

249
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:19,740
you need to you need to select your mentor before the end of the semester.

250
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:23,970
Then I will send an announcement.

251
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:39,399
Please send me I. Have any idea about your own reason why you want to do this is what kind of research you are into to do.

252
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:42,460
Because the idea for me to try to.

253
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:52,490
Whenever you do my shoot with the right person getting the department lead in that department.

254
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:56,720
But I will send the announcement through campus. That would be a homework, too.

255
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:01,970
Then you guys need to send me a few lines in an integrated release doing that type of research.

256
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:06,530
Are you ready to discuss to gauge these students?

257
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:12,110
Yeah. Also for this to just me, even when you have, I'm interested in what you want to do.

258
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:17,470
Yeah. Whole what will be for everyone and via email.

259
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,950
No, not will be through campus. Then you can. You can upload a document.

260
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:27,860
Just say one document, short document, a couple sentences.

261
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:35,760
My game is more power, that is more paragraph.

262
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:43,740
Because I know that even at this moment you may have a general idea where you want to do

263
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:48,360
best in you are you don't have exactly what you want to talk about the general idea.

264
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:53,879
Yes, we are you looking specifically at U of M if we like.

265
00:32:53,880 --> 00:33:01,800
I graduated from MSU. If I know somebody from. Okay.

266
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:12,990
Let me play you that. Now for formally, the mental has to be someone from that department because none of them is blind.

267
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:16,020
They must be aware.

268
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:24,870
What we have done in that case is when those students are based on that note from the university and want to work with that person.

269
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:35,790
That is great for us. But because let me tell you, we are having problems doing the matching and sound mental because I knowledge form of our

270
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:40,229
faculty they are in sabbatical or they are planning to take a sabbatical in the next semester.

271
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:49,320
Then they say, no, I can not take any student right now or are oh maybe they right now overload with the students.

272
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:54,170
Then for us you get the first one that you want to go with.

273
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:59,100
I don't know that university. That would be great for us. Then what we need, what we do.

274
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:04,950
In that case, you just like I say, you can get when to have these men talking here to sign papers that you can.

275
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:10,320
You are more than welcome you have up there so. No, I'm just saying hypothetically.

276
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:12,839
Yeah. Then don't, don't, don't worry.

277
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:20,720
You have a personal mind if there is someone from the university that you will we like to work with doing your thesis.

278
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,960
Your. That. We can read that.

279
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:34,770
The question now also could be also whether there is school in the university from that department.

280
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:40,560
We are flexible. You do that even when we say formally has to be someone from the department.

281
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:49,830
But we are flexible. We cannot. Okay.

282
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:52,890
Then you don't have more questions. That is all for today.

283
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:57,450
This is homework. I will. I will post the announcement in combats of support.

284
00:34:57,450 --> 00:35:00,959
And you know what you need to do. You have any question?

285
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:05,820
In the meantime, please send me an email you want to set up office.

286
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:10,320
I would also say many mail. You don't have more questions and I will see you next Monday.

287
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:14,580
Thank you so much. You're welcome. If you're the.

288
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:43,330
Once we got inside the windows.

289
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:49,900
We need your help. Get in here.

290
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:59,270
Yeah. Okay. Now, for the guy that was on your record, you said.

291
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:08,890
And so we got to the point where we're like, no, I don't think they would even even know.

292
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:18,320
But these classes will have all that usable stuff, right,

293
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:28,190
that we've be able to put in there in this case, because this is related to more directly that disease.

294
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:41,150
The. You're fabulous because I see the idea in my head.

295
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:50,050
I did read the paper that week, but the idea for that recent project that there is not.

296
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:57,950
And. Yeah, don't. Don't worry about that homework. Okay. No, I don't know yet.

297
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:03,050
Yeah, but please read updates. Oh, yes, definitely. Also. Yeah.

298
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:15,270
Yeah. I just think I feel. And yet that that is the part that we need to work with because the idea that we say,

299
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:25,130
you know what, you might want to I will sign your name for writing pages.

300
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:29,419
I need you to let people know. Okay. A sighted paper.

301
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:48,440
I won't do that because we. Well, Dr. Kay was telling me and she said and also Dr. Burgess said, I have to find a mentor on the medical team.

302
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:55,980
Yeah. Because that it really means that the people that will depend on that type of research that would depend on.

303
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:02,700
That may be. There is no.

304
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:11,820
Right. Give me 1/2. Yes. Give me 1/2 at the same.
