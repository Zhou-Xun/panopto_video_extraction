1
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:11,330
Hi, welcome back. In this next session, we will talk about the role of non-profit organizations and other stakeholders in the global health sector.

2
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:15,110
What I want to make sure you take away from this session is, number one,

3
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:21,440
an understanding of the role of non-profits and other key stakeholders and their roles in the global health sector,

4
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:25,910
but also how these entities interface, because there are definitely power dynamic between them.

5
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:27,320
So I want you to recognize them.

6
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:37,650
I want you to understand and I want you to critically think about them as you start to deepen your studies in global health.

7
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:43,650
I created this graphic just to demonstrate really sort of the interplay and the alignment

8
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:49,810
ideally that you want to find between the different stakeholders. However, it's important to recognize power dynamics.

9
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:52,470
I'll first talk about the non-profit sector.

10
00:00:52,470 --> 00:01:00,390
When you look at the non-profit sector in global health, they're often referred to as NGOs or non-governmental organizations.

11
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:07,420
By virtue, of that definition, and the work that non-profit or NGO's do in

12
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:17,220
the global health sector, they're perceived as politically neutral, so safe, and unneutral  states or neutral entity to seek services and support

13
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:23,580
and, you know, pretty much resources, but also, the NGO sector typically has a wide geographic scope.

14
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:28,470
A lot of them started off as volunteer driven organizations, and they may still be.

15
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:37,020
They really have an expansive geographic presence, especially what we call INGOs, which are international non-governmental organizations,

16
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:45,650
meaning they are more often than not, these organizations are often headquartered either in the US, somewhere in the West or Europe someplace.

17
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:54,720
But, they do work around the world, around the globe. So NGOs have a wide geographic presence, politically neutral,

18
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:01,160
they have a lot of community trust due to their history communities being perceived as politically neutral,

19
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:04,670
but also because of the services they're providing through philanthropic dollars.

20
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:11,810
They often provide services, if not on a sliding scale, then at no charge, and really try to reach rural communities and

21
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:17,720
really make sure that access to unmet needs is provided, and those needs are met.

22
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:23,410
But then also, the relationship, the government. It's viewed that nonprofit

23
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:28,930
or NGOs really align or try to partner with governments.

24
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:34,550
But if not, they are willing to kind of really implement their work and really provide resources to address unmet needs,

25
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:38,300
but really trying to do that in coordination with government without being a part of the government,

26
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:42,440
but making sure to align with government health objectives, for example. And finally,

27
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:47,840
relationship with key donors, because of the nature of nonprofit organizations,

28
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,440
and their business structure, and how programs are funded,

29
00:02:52,440 --> 00:03:03,140
key multinational donors, grant making foundations, private sector donors tend to have relationship with the nonprofit sector.

30
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:10,670
Next, I'll talk about other key stakeholders and their financial contributors. Other key stakeholders, and we'll delve into that in the next slide,

31
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:16,790
really talk about other stakeholders like peer organizations,

32
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:23,990
other INGOs that maybe one organization focuses on water, sanitation and hygiene and that's their expertize,

33
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:31,100
and that's all they provide. And maybe another organization has more expansive expertise in providing global health, really.

34
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:36,260
And maybe that global health relief is actually specific to reproductive and women's health services that immunization.

35
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:39,710
So then you may find it, immunization services are needed.

36
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:42,350
So you want to partner with an organization that provides that.

37
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:50,810
So, there's a lot of interplay between peer organizations that compete for funding, yet partner on projects of interesting ecosystems.

38
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:59,990
Faith leaders in communities are significant, significant globally in the U.S. and abroad as key stakeholders, community based organizations or CEOs.

39
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:03,860
And we'll talk a little bit more about these of these other key stakeholders.

40
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:10,970
I'll also share, financial contributors are a significant, of course, stakeholder in global health.

41
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:17,810
Some of the ones I've discussed here are multinational government aid funding, grant making foundations and investors.

42
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:22,220
I think what's key here is to recognize the power dynamic.

43
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:27,890
You have nonprofit organizations who depend on funding from financial contributors and

44
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:33,170
even other key stakeholders that depend on funding from other financial contributors.

45
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:42,060
So who has the power? Who has a say? Who controls programing when community organizations are more proximate to the problem

46
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:49,670
then sometimes those donors are? So how do non-profit organizations wield their knowledge and their expertise with

47
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:53,750
donors or financial contributors to help educate them on what the needs are,

48
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:59,330
especially emerging needs on how to change their approach or approaches to philanthropic

49
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:04,030
contributions, while also wanting to be a recipient and wanting to appease those donors?

50
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:10,010
So it's an interesting dynamic and interplay, and it's definitely a balancing act to try to be respectful

51
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:14,180
of your donor and to try to position yourself to receive funding from them for

52
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:19,370
the critical services non-profit organizations provide while also advocating

53
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:25,070
for the community that you're a partner with, to provide health services to.

54
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:30,830
This next slide, and it's actually the last slide, just kind of provides you with a deeper dive and an overview

55
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:36,380
of some example organizations and just types of organizations that we just discussed.

56
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:39,950
So non-profit organizations, you can think of the Global Fund to fight AIDS,

57
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:48,800
TB and Malaria as a global INGO are global non-profit organizations, slash non-governmental organizations.

58
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,390
The International Red Cross is an INGO, an international NGO.

59
00:05:53,390 --> 00:06:02,420
CARE International is an INGO. There's different branches, there's CARE Canada, CARE USA, CARE France, CARE Australia, CARE UK.

60
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:08,150
Those are operational divisions. And each of them are responsible for providing support,

61
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:13,640
funding and programing through grants to a certain number of countries.

62
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:19,340
International Relief Committee is an INGO, Doctors Without Borders,

63
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:24,670
the Asia Foundation, Population Services International, Pathfinder to National.

64
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:29,690
There are numerous INGOs, but we also don't want to ignore other stakeholders.

65
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:35,430
We'll talk about that in a minute. I want to go to the second column and talk about donors and funders.

66
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:44,810
When you look at the scope and intensity of global health challenges, there's no single country or agency that can work alone to tackle these issues.

67
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:50,960
It requires a multiple international agency then institutions to help shape global health policy.

68
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:58,370
So address a systemic issue and to get specific funding for them to implement initiative and to evaluate those programs.

69
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:06,440
It's very much a collaborative and expansive sector that requires a great deal of collaboration and knowledge share yet competition,

70
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:17,320
which is entering an interactive dynamic. But it also requires the support of different regional offices of different federal governments,

71
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:23,600
government agencies, private foundations, universities and just other global health organizations,

72
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,470
because the goal is to improve health outcomes,

73
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:35,740
provide technical expertise in doing so, and to employ new strategies to enhance and possibly evolve the practice of global health.

74
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:43,000
And in doing so, of course, that requires systems like kind of what the CDC has with its global health security agenda to make sure that

75
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,070
a platform for sharing those information there's transparency so that lessons learned can be leveraged.

76
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:56,830
So I go to the next column, when we look at donors and funders, remember, that was the second bubble of financial contributors. Often what we don't,

77
00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:01,540
what you may not consider is the financial contributor really is, so we have what we call bilateral agencies.

78
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:05,320
That's from one country to the global countries.

79
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:09,670
That's a Center for Disease Control and Prevention that has technical specialists.

80
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:15,760
USAID has technical specialist, but they also push up funding or award funding to INGOs

81
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:23,740
and even local NGOs for program work. But they still have technical specialists that also advise that are heavily involved in guiding the program,

82
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:29,500
in helping to develop annual work plans, et cetera. Then we have what we call multilateral agencies.

83
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:37,740
If you hear the word multilateral, that means by the nature of how these organizations are structured, they are global.

84
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:44,680
They may have a secretariat. They may have some type of

85
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:49,180
office, center like office, but the intent and the focus has always been global.

86
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:55,180
They won't have means like the US Agency for International Development in its World Health Organization.

87
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:58,750
United Nations Children's Fund and the World Bank.

88
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:05,620
They are really key donors, are financial contributors. I'll talk a little bit about each of these so you can get a little bit about them.

89
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:15,070
But when you think about the World Health Organization, it was established shortly after World War Two, as a multilateral health organization to

90
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:20,410
unite countries in the common goal of tackling disease and achieving better health outcomes;

91
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:28,690
and it recruits a variety of experts, including medical doctors, researchers, epidemiologists, administrative staff,

92
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:34,810
statisticians, economists and other related fields to provide a wide range of programs and projects worldwide.

93
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:39,220
So there's a global focus when you see funding from World Health Organization or initiative.

94
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:45,420
The lend is really very global. United UNICEF or the United Nations Children's Fund.

95
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:48,760
They're critical player, particularly in child health initiatives.

96
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:57,100
And the majority of it's not administrative budget is promoting healthy initiative and prioritizing the needs of really, really vulnerable children.

97
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:07,090
Specifically, UNICEF strives to address health concerns such as HIV and AIDS, maternal and child nutrition, excessive maternal mortality,

98
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:15,420
increasing vaccination rates among other areas of importance, such as gender equality and child survival and development.

99
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:23,940
World Bank is a key donor, a key institution for investment and health and development initiatives.

100
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:31,500
They play a critical role in global health policy as well. You'll find you'll see global health involved in a lot of global health policy initiatives.

101
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:36,660
But the global health strives to alleviate poverty by providing loans. So it's a different type of funding.

102
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:44,820
But providing loans, credits and grants to poor communities to prevent various development projects in areas such as education,

103
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:50,910
health care, agriculture, environmental, natural resource management, infrastructure and other relevant projects.

104
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:54,900
Remember, we talked about infrastructure development as a critical aspect of global health.

105
00:10:54,900 --> 00:11:01,560
The gradient of facilities, lack of resources. World Bank is one of those contributors to infrastructure development,

106
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:10,310
along with USAID. And then there's other types of donors like Grant making foundations like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

107
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:15,120
There's the Eleanor Crook Foundation, which focuses on global nutrition.

108
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:21,090
There is also impact investors going back to World Bank that also provide investment capital,

109
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:29,120
and that are loans. There are different types of investment capital, but you'll start to see the terminology if you haven't seen it already impact investors.

110
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:34,730
So typically the international landscape, they are looking for social entrepreneurs.

111
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:39,950
What we call entrepreneurs who have really a social mission are to address a social issue.

112
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:42,950
Impact investors like to, they definitely want a financial return,

113
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:47,960
if you remove the word impact, it's definitely investing, but investing and reporting against environmental,

114
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:53,890
social and or governance challenges and the achievement of certain goals.

115
00:11:53,890 --> 00:12:00,230
And I'll give you an example at the end of a social enterprise that's receiving impact investment capital.

116
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:07,230
But also multinational and local governments, there's other aid systems in addition to the U.S. Agency for International Development,

117
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:10,310
there's U.K. aid, there's Australia aid, Canadian.

118
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:15,770
Canada has an aid system, but there's different multinational governments that provide aid, including local governments.

119
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:19,940
They have budgets to meet the needs of local communities quickly.

120
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:23,810
Other stakeholders, as we discussed previously, I grouped them,

121
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:29,070
it's a really big grouping, but it's significant to really recognize the other players that are necessary,

122
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:35,870
critical to achieving global health outcomes. Country governments, country governments, in order to sustain those outcomes,

123
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:40,100
are key in making sure there's alignment with the global health agenda.

124
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:45,230
What do they identify as a key priority? What programs do they want to make sure to advance?

125
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:49,910
Where have there been previous investments from other donors that can be leveraged to and

126
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:54,110
partner with to advance those goals and to give that knowledge and to make sure that

127
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:58,730
the funding that's provided tie them to that and continue those programs. Universities

128
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:02,840
and research institutions to study and understand which approaches are working.

129
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:07,640
It's beyond monitoring evaluation. If you've heard of any monogenic evaluation,

130
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:13,340
it's really an in-depth study to understand and have it validated in a peer review

131
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:17,840
to make sure that these are ballot results that can be universalized a little bit,

132
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:23,540
at least within, within that country content. Health facilities are critical

133
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:31,670
stakeholders, local organizations, including community based organizations are significant because they are entrenched in the community,

134
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:35,600
unlike INGO, they may not leave when funding runs out. They'er often

135
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,890
also volunteer driven. Faith communities are significant.

136
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:47,420
I also want to point out traditional leaders, because the U.S. Agency for International Development and a lot of other multinational

137
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:51,740
governmental donors are also recognizing the influence of traditional leaders,

138
00:13:51,740 --> 00:14:00,620
including traditional healers, including chiefs. But primarily in international context, but also within key demographics in any country.

139
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:08,150
You're working on a global health initiative or with a health organization in the U.S. and perhaps you're part of the community,

140
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:13,640
or one community that you're servicing focuses or are immigrants from another country.

141
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:17,270
There are certain dynamics that maybe you need to be aware of. There are key influencers,

142
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:21,650
perhaps in that community that ideally, as a global health practitioner you

143
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:25,890
would want to connect with when designing your global health program or initiative.

144
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:30,920
I also want to talk about the private sector. The private sector is also a donor, they get also an implementer of key initiatives.

145
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,530
You'll read their corporate social responsibility reports.

146
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:41,740
They're often directly involved in implementing some initiative, maybe related to climate change, but then also partnered with INGOs.

147
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:47,360
So to be a donor and then also be a key stakeholder, imagine that level of influence that your donor,

148
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,630
you may have to push back and say, I think that's a bad approach.

149
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:55,310
We as an NGO that know this community really well, really feel like this should be done.

150
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:57,410
Whereas your private sector donors may feel differently.

151
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:03,170
So there are different dynamics that are often at play, but know that the private sector is especially

152
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:08,790
keen on addressing the sustainable development goals and are being tracked and monitored.

153
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:14,720
But it's important to recognize there's a dynamic that's happening particularly between NGOs

154
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:23,330
and the private sector, and then media outlets are an important stakeholder in the global health sector in terms of spreading health information,

155
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:30,050
but also ensuring that misinformation is not being spread to support Global Health Initiative.

156
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:34,390
I hope this gave you a good overview. I'll go back to the slide of the key players.

157
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:35,600
And if you'll recognize in the middle,

158
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:43,410
the goal is to find aligned priority shared value and find that sweet spot for collaboration opportunities for impact.

159
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:48,900
And it's not easy as it seems, because there are often different focus areas for different stakeholders,

160
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:55,260
a private sector company maybe like Unilever, that owns the brand of Lipton tea.

161
00:15:55,260 --> 00:16:03,420
They're a good example to look at in terms of environmental initiatives and health initiatives, they decided to invest in among smallholder tea farmers.

162
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:10,290
But that was a negotiation, and that required some partnerships also with NGOs in terms of tracking and monitoring and guaranteeing that

163
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:14,540
they were really achieving those goals and really going about it the right way.

164
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:21,700
But look at some examples: there's the push and pull, there are different tensions, there are different negotiations with the goal to get to the middle.

165
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:27,900
Aligned priority is making sure we have shared values, which is important, and it's identifying those, those opportunities for collaboration and impact.

166
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:33,870
But I hope this gave you a clear overview of the stakeholders that are involved in the global health landscape,

167
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:40,800
how they interface, where they can potentially partner, and just some other considerations. I will share

168
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:46,320
also, when you look at country governments, all other stakeholders often, particularly the Ministry of Education,

169
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,320
there's also a Minister of Agriculture, a Ministry of Education in different countries.

170
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:56,940
But the Ministry of Health, that's part of the country government, they often employ zonal or regional health officers.

171
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:00,750
So it's important as a global health organization, particularly one at base.

172
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:07,950
That's an INGO that's based in the West, to really partner not only with your local country office if you have an INGO,

173
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:12,390
but also really build a relationship with those local health and zonal offices that are employed

174
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:18,690
by the government to ensure there's a positive relationship, there's continuous communication and also

175
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:23,730
lessons learned that can be unpacked and shared that those government officials and those health officials

176
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:29,580
can share and distribute among all the multiple NGOs that are working in a certain context.

177
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:35,950
So that's just an overview of the interplay of the different types of stakeholders, and I hope they provided you with the key takeaways we discussed.

178
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:39,300
And I'm looking forward to delving next into career opportunities,

179
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:43,950
and also talking about how you can integrate diversity, equity, inclusion into your global health.

180
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:46,000
Thank you.
