1
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:16,800
OK, we are going to talk about respiratory tract infections today, but before I get into respiratory tract infections, I'm going to hand out exam two.

2
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:24,570
I took a check to make sure all the scores were correct on online, so we're giving them back to you now and then.

3
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:30,820
Then then this system is putting on the extra credit points right now and you put them on line scores on line.

4
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:35,940
I'll check them tonight. You'll get them back on Wednesday. OK?

5
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:46,660
Next thing? Since we're not talking about diseases caused by the bacteria and other organisms that we have been talking about all term,

6
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:50,920
I want to point out a paper to you that was published in Clinical Infectious Diseases.

7
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:55,120
And yes, the library carries clinical infectious diseases. It was an IDSA guideline.

8
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,860
I was on it. I was one of the coauthors in a large group of coauthors.

9
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:04,870
It's the guide to the utilization of the Microbiology Laboratory for Diagnosis of Infectious Diseases.

10
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:08,160
It's the 2018 update. Front cover looks like this.

11
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:18,870
Anybody wants to see what it looks like. If you want updated information on how microbiology labs work, this would be a good place to look.

12
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:24,300
And it's only like a zillion pages long. OK.

13
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:28,890
Winter exam, final exam, I have exams scheduled right here.

14
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:40,590
I printed it off. And yes, our final exam in this class is on Friday, April 20, second from 1:30 to 3:30.

15
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:54,400
So I want to make sure that everybody knows that. And finally, before I get into the lecture, I had some questions by people after the last exam.

16
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:59,500
Is there anything good thing that they could do if they wanted to bring the scores up?

17
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:04,450
And I have. Well, what I've done in the past didn't do a last year did the year before.

18
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:15,430
I let the students write a short paper no more than three pages typewritten or on your computer printed out something relating to this class.

19
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,740
And so I have some possible topics.

20
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:28,540
You don't have to use these topics, but if you want to, you know, feel free to to write on, you can come and pick up a copy of this when you leave.

21
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:35,020
And I will pass out them to before everybody leaves.

22
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:49,270
OK, OK, respiratory tract infections. So excuse me, upper versus lower respiratory tract.

23
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:54,850
So the upper respiratory tract, I'm just going through this. I'm sure you all know it, but just in case I want to make sure.

24
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:59,920
But you know, it's the same information upper respiratory tract, the ears,

25
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:07,600
the mucous membranes lining the nose and the throat above the epiglottis and the sinuses at the upper respiratory tract.

26
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:14,050
Everything else is lower. OK. You can see it on the on the the screen bronchitis.

27
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:18,160
Lower respiratory tract infections would be bronchitis and bronchiolitis.

28
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,030
Community acquired pneumonia or any other kind of pneumonia,

29
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:27,670
including health care associated ventilator associated pneumonia, infections of the plural space.

30
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:34,090
Bronchopulmonary infections in patients with cystic fibrosis and pneumonia in immunocompromised hosts.

31
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:41,700
OK. Then let's talk a little bit about pathogenesis of respiratory tract infections.

32
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:46,770
Host factors play an extremely important role.

33
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:49,530
They protect the host. That's what they're meant to do.

34
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:56,400
However, sometimes something happens and they don't work as well as they should at some of the host factors that protect the host other nasal here.

35
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:04,500
If you don't think of all of those being protected, but they are the convoluted passageways in the respiratory tract mucus.

36
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:12,180
People don't like mucus, but it actually helps trap microorganisms the secretory antibodies, cilia and so on.

37
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:22,590
So normal microbiota are normal. Flora help to keep the invaders out, so they're doing their job, but can also cause disease.

38
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:28,120
So it's kind of a very delicate balancing act.

39
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:37,540
So there's also you also also have to consider the virulence factors of the organisms they can adhere to to various structures,

40
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:49,300
such as the way they may protect produce Typekit acid and additional thin and especially gram negative organisms that helps them grab on.

41
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:57,580
They produce toxins. Not every type of bacteria or fungus or invading organism produce toxins, but some of them do.

42
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:06,580
Some of the toxins are extracellular. Some of them are intracellular, so it just depends on if they're a toxin or where do they produce those toxins.

43
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:13,510
So as an example, some species of Pseudomonas aeruginosa produce a toxin similar to the diphtheria toxin.

44
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:22,090
Most people don't know that it's very toxic is one of the most. Deadly toxins known to humans.

45
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:28,210
B. Pertussis also produces a toxin, as do staph aureus and the baby hemolytic strep.

46
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:35,440
So just because we haven't talked about him specifically in class, a lot of organisms do produce toxins.

47
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:41,680
And for staph aureus, the number one thing I think it was staph aureus is toxic shock.

48
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:48,620
Now that's not in the respiratory tract, but it does cause infections and diseases.

49
00:05:48,620 --> 00:06:00,770
So in addition to adherence to cells and toxin production, diseases can be caused by organisms growing in the host tissues.

50
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:02,690
So they when they grow in the host tissues,

51
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:10,370
they can interfere with normal tissue function and they attract can attract white blood cells, generally pigments.

52
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:20,300
But it may be macrophages that can damage the host tissues while they're fighting off the invaders.

53
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:30,340
So. Those respiratory viruses in particular are really sneaky, but rest assured, pathogens can avoid the host immune response.

54
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:39,830
They may have polysaccharide capsules. And strep pneumo has them Haemophilus influenza Cryptococcus neoformans,

55
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:46,500
and some organisms produce polysaccharide capsules when they we don't normally think of them having polysaccharide capsules.

56
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:56,130
The effect of that polysaccharide capsule, it's slippery, the white blood cell slide off, they can't get in and engulf that that organism.

57
00:06:56,130 --> 00:07:00,390
And some restless pathogens can multiply within the host cells.

58
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:06,990
We know chlamydia can do that. We know Mycobacterium can do that. So there's a lot of ways to cause disease in humans.

59
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:11,130
So I wanted to put this in and it's from that paper.

60
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:20,670
Key points for lab diagnosis of upper respiratory tract infections Swabs are not recommended for otitis media sinusitis.

61
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:31,180
Submit an expert for culture OK. Most cases of otitis media can be diagnosed clinically and treated without culture.

62
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:41,020
Throat specimens require a firm and thorough sampling of the throat and tonsils avoid the cheeks, the gums and the teeth.

63
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:45,430
And if you feel like your throat has been scrubbed, that's a good specimen.

64
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:53,860
Haemophilus influenzae, staph aureus, Neisseria meningitidis and strep pneumoniae are not etiologic agents of pharyngitis.

65
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:59,440
I know so many residents have tried to have encountered it during working in the hospital and in public health.

66
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:04,930
Have tried to treat patients for these. No, they're not the agents of pharyngitis.

67
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:13,690
You don't look for them in throat cultures. You have to look for organisms that we know cause pharyngitis.

68
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:20,230
And nor can nasal pharyngeal cultures accurately predict the etiologic agent in sinusitis.

69
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:27,180
Want to know what's causing a patient's sinusitis? You got to get up there and get a specimen.

70
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:36,660
So let's talk a little bit about otitis media. There are a vast majority of cases of otitis due to viruses.

71
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:41,340
There is no pathogen specific therapy available.

72
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:48,570
It's all supportive therapy. Therefore, there's no need to establish an ideological diagnosis.

73
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:49,980
And I'll say there's no need for this.

74
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:58,980
However, if in the case of this, a transplant patient and you're worried about a patient getting sick and other sites,

75
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:04,560
that might be a reason establish etiologic diagnosis. But that is very, very rare.

76
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:15,630
The most common etiologies of otitis media are strep pneumo, non type, all Haemophilus influenzae and more seleccao rallies.

77
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:21,780
It's very rare when staph aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa cause otitis media very, very rare.

78
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:27,630
Now I will tell you Pseudomonas aeruginosa can cause rumors here, which is a little bit different.

79
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:33,810
But then you get a history of the person being a swimmer and that should all fit together in your mind.

80
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:40,470
So the only truly representative specimen is is middle ear fluid,

81
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:49,320
obtained by tactile to panel synthesis or by collecting drainage from miringoff tubes that are put in to drain the ears,

82
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:54,480
cultures of the throat and knees, and parents nasal drainage or into the interior.

83
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:02,120
Nariz are of no use. They will not tell you what the etiological agent is.

84
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,150
Now, Sinusitis.

85
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:16,760
Etiologic agent vary depending on the duration of symptoms and whether it is a community acquired or nosocomial infection of another criminal origin.

86
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:28,560
The most common causes of acute maxillary sinusitis are strep pneumonia, eye non-tribal Haemophilus influenzae and more silicate or else.

87
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:38,010
Again, we really don't know how important the respiratory viruses are in sinusitis.

88
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:43,430
They may set things up and the bacteria come in and take over.

89
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:52,160
I like it to face the thing here, but we really don't know the role of the respiratory viruses in sinusitis.

90
00:10:52,160 --> 00:11:07,310
Staph aureus gram negative bacilli, strep Streptococcus species and Arabs are associated with subacute, chronic or nosocomial sinusitis.

91
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:16,790
And then we get to my friends the fungi. Their role in sinusitis is really controversial due to poor sample collection methods.

92
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:26,060
In the studies, the studies have not been good. So if somebody wants to do a large study, this would be a good one to do in immuno competent hosts.

93
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:31,810
Fungi may be associated with chronic sinusitis.

94
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:47,140
And severely immunocompromised persons or uncontrolled diabetics is often associated with severe disease with a high mortality rate.

95
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:53,500
So what's this about, are we going to correct if we want to culture the sinuses?

96
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:59,890
You can't just open up your nose and when they reach up there, it doesn't work that way.

97
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:07,950
So you only need to establish the etiologic diagnosis for patients with complicated infections or chronic disease.

98
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:12,120
So swabs are not recommended, they don't get up high enough.

99
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:19,770
You don't get enough specimen. Experts are much more productive of the true etiologic agent or agents.

100
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:26,580
So physician or health care practitioner needs to get up there and obtain an aspirin.

101
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:36,390
If you use a swab of the endoscopic we collected, you can recover bacterial pathogens but rarely detect the positive fungi.

102
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:41,130
Now, I have to tell you when we talk about the causative fungi causing bad sinusitis,

103
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:50,630
if a new core or something like that gets up in the sinuses, the patient really doesn't have much of a chance.

104
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:59,070
In adults with maxillary sinusitis swabs, a material draining from the middle needles on the side is obtained under endoscopic.

105
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:07,250
Oh, I'm sorry, I think I've misspelled its guidance or andro puncture with sinus aspiration represent the only adequate specimens.

106
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:11,180
I'm sorry about the misspelling in pediatric patients,

107
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:19,520
though the only valid specimens are obtained in surgery from the frontal spheroid or f moit sinuses,

108
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:27,280
so the child has to be taken to surgery for a good the best specimen.

109
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:32,830
So lab diagnosis of acute maxillary sinusitis.

110
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:37,930
We have the etiologic agents on the left hand side, then the diagnostic procedures,

111
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:44,200
optimum specimens and transport issues, and all of these need to be considered if you're getting one of these specimens.

112
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:55,300
So example, for an example, strep pneumo, we're going to look on, make a slide of the specimen and look for gram positive Karzai.

113
00:13:55,300 --> 00:14:03,070
We will also set up, of course, a a a culture, but you're going to look for it immediately with a gram stain.

114
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:11,440
The optimum specimen is an aspirin obtained by antral puncture of the sinus and then for transport issues.

115
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,580
There is a collection device called a sinus secretion collector,

116
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:22,120
which is a vacuum aspirin that it's a sterile aspirate and it can aspirate out of that area.

117
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:28,010
And then it gets set as a step specimen to the laboratory.

118
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:36,600
So you can go along here, and if there's nothing there's nothing specific silver, more solar catalyst.

119
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:42,080
The diagnostic procedures are the same for everything gram's stain and culture.

120
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:47,930
And you use a swab. Room temperature again to the lab within two hours.

121
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:53,150
Infrequent causes of maxillary sinusitis. People always claim to have staph aureus sinusitis.

122
00:14:53,150 --> 00:15:00,460
It's very rare. So staph aureus is rare. Strep hydrogenase is rare.

123
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:05,650
So now we have complicated sinusitis, and we have a lot of that, too.

124
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:11,680
You can see here all this list of bacteria and the diagnostic procedures for those would be, of course,

125
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:19,540
the grandstand of the specimen aerobic and anaerobic culture and how what is the optimum specimen?

126
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:30,870
It's an effort obtained by Andro Puncture again or if the patient is in surgery, is a tissue or an aspirin obtained surgically.

127
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:33,030
And then with the transport to the laboratory,

128
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:41,910
you have to use a sinus secretion collector and that master I talked about, you could use a sterile anaerobic container.

129
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:49,680
So it's anaerobic conditions and inside the container transport at room temperature immediate to the lab.

130
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:56,610
For fungal fungal, it's about the worst thing I can think of having causing a sinusitis.

131
00:15:56,610 --> 00:16:04,950
If you think about this item, it's growing and nothing stopping them, and it rapidly causes death rapidly cause.

132
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:10,620
So here we have Aspergillus and then the zygote, my seeds.

133
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:16,260
And then, of course, Fusarium and other moles. But the zygote, my sister, the ones that I would really worry about.

134
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:21,780
How do we what what do we look for them with? We do a diet. We do a slide, we do a calico floor.

135
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:27,360
White is better than a cage stain, but you have to have a fluorescent scope to look at it.

136
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:34,170
So you don't have a fluorescence scope. You look at it, whether it can wait to death and then of course, set up a fungus culture.

137
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:39,720
And one thing to remember with fungi is you don't try not to grind the tissue.

138
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:45,000
If you get tissue, you remind the lab you mentioned to the lab,

139
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,580
please dismiss the tissue girlfriend because you can tear the hyphae apart and nothing will grow.

140
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:57,870
So aspirate the specimen aspirate obtained by Andrell puncture tissue or in aspirate from surgery.

141
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:04,320
Transport sinuses secretion collector, which is a vacuum respirator, a sterile anaerobic container,

142
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:15,230
set up room temperature immediately to the lab or sterile aerobic container immediately sent to the lab.

143
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:19,460
OK. Pharyngitis anybody in here ever had a sore throat.

144
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:28,520
I have a lot of people have mostly their allergies or viruses, not bacteria, but a lot of people get sore throats.

145
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:34,760
So approximately 40 million visits to physicians by adults who or pharyngitis each year.

146
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:39,590
And even more visits for children with pharyngitis throat.

147
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:46,190
The results of the lab tests done on that throat swab specimen play a key role in therapeutic decisions.

148
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:52,430
So no matter who the physician is, they're not good enough to look at patients throat and say,

149
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:57,080
Oh, it's strep, I'll give penicillin doesn't work like that.

150
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:02,960
So antimicrobial therapy is only warranted if the patient has a proven bacterial

151
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:09,350
etiology for the pharyngitis has been documented in many publications.

152
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:14,330
With it, more cases of pharyngitis are due to virus viruses than to bacteria.

153
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:20,810
So the antimicrobial agents and the bacterial agents, you know, are useless against viruses.

154
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:27,740
But what they can do is knock out any other additional for normal flora and make the situation worse.

155
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:39,940
And of course, I'm sure you all know the most common bacterial cause of pharyngitis a strep hydrogenase or group IBD hemolytic strep.

156
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:43,880
So a little bit more on strep throat. You can.

157
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:52,330
There are various ways to establish the etiology of pharyngitis due to Group A Streptococcus.

158
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:58,600
You can do a culture. You can do a rapid antigen or you can do a molecular acid.

159
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:03,880
Now the culture gets a specimen in the lab, you strip the specimen on the plate.

160
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:13,600
It's not looked at for 18 to 24 hours. OK. And then at that time, you look for better hemolytic colonies and you can do a rapid I.D. on them.

161
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,260
So what? You're looking at a minimum of twenty four hours, maybe a little bit longer.

162
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:22,240
If they knew the susceptibility of patients allergic to a lot of drugs.

163
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:30,370
Antigens are nice, but you need sufficient organisms, more organisms than you need to be positive on a molecular test.

164
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:38,580
Molecular is a wonderful not every laboratory can do them or have that assay up and running at the at the present time.

165
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:45,050
So it's really not necessary to do theology for a strap.

166
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:52,760
It is absolute evidence of disease due to the organism, but I think there are easier ways to.

167
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:56,580
See the presence of the organism in a specimen.

168
00:19:56,580 --> 00:20:06,150
If your laboratory is using is starting out with a rapid antigen test on a person less than 16 years of age, and it's negative.

169
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:12,030
It is mandatory that they follow up with a culture or molecular culture or molecular.

170
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:19,290
You can't just stop with that rapid antigen. Next.

171
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:25,710
OK. Other etiologies and pharyngitis. Well, some of the other streptococci can cause pharyngitis.

172
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:30,780
There would be groups of CNG baby hemolytic strep,

173
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:39,120
and there are rare cases of post streptococcal glomerulonephritis that's been reported after infection with these organisms.

174
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:46,950
So following up, you get a kidney infection following your streptococcal pharyngitis.

175
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:52,560
So group CNG are generally make fairly large colonies on blood,

176
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:59,580
but you only can assess that after you've seen a lot of them bus in into gnosis, another Streptococcus species,

177
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:03,360
which actually grows very well anaerobic as well as in aerobically,

178
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:11,910
makes pinpoint colonies and doesn't cause pharyngitis but can cause other types of problems.

179
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:24,570
Then we have our Kanayo bacterium hemolytic, so it's not as common as Group Strep pharyngitis, but it can be seen in teenagers and young adults.

180
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:35,140
OK. If you're worried that a patent pharyngitis may be caused by a chronic bacterium, diphtheria is the agent of diphtheria,

181
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:46,630
and maybe the patient has been vaccinated or Neisseria gonorrhea, which happens, those organisms must be specifically requested.

182
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:52,810
When you said a throat swab in a strip screen, we don't look for a Corynebacterium diphtheriae are not Neisseria gonorrhea, so you need it.

183
00:21:52,810 --> 00:22:03,420
If there's any suspicion, you need to specifically request those. The rest of toy viruses are shown here.

184
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:11,220
Herpes simplex, HIV, Epstein-Barr and viruses can also cause pharyngitis.

185
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:16,800
And so if everything else is negative and you have other reasons to believe that the patient has a viral infection,

186
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:24,840
maybe by looking at the CBC, you might want to do some testing for respiratory viruses on some specimens.

187
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:31,080
And finally, an anaerobe Fusobacterium Knepper forum is a premier prelude.

188
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:37,730
If it's there, it's prelude to the Mirror syndrome, which is very, very serious.

189
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:45,220
Next slide. So key points for lab diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infections.

190
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:49,480
The first morning sputum is always best for culture if you're culturing sputum.

191
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:58,720
You want that first morning one, OK? And remember, I can't say this enough times spit is not the same thing as sputum.

192
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:04,630
And in the lab, we can tell whether it's food or not, just by looking for a problem or for nuclear lymphocytes.

193
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:10,900
OK, spit or saliva is going to have other types of cells, but not a lot of calls.

194
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:16,270
Calcium alginate swabs are not acceptable for nucleic acid amplification.

195
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:25,840
They are toxic in that reaction. So you cannot use a calcium alginate swab for a nucleic acid like the specimen for a nucleic acid test.

196
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:34,990
Most rapid antigen tests should be confirmed by another method, and generally, that's a culture like the rapid antigen because it's rapid,

197
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:41,790
but it's not as sensitive, does not pick up as much as a culture or a molecular test.

198
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:50,670
Blood cultures that accompany sputum specimens may occasionally be helpful, particularly in a high risk community acquired pneumonia patient.

199
00:23:50,670 --> 00:24:00,060
So if your patient is a high risk for community acquired pneumonia, it's a good idea to draw a couple of blood cultures also.

200
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:09,900
That way, you'll have a couple more shots at actually determining whether, in fact it is and getting a susceptibility on it.

201
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:19,320
The lab should be contacted for specific instructions prior to collection of specimens for fastidious pathogens such as Bordetella pertussis.

202
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,930
Very few labs actually culture for pertussis anymore.

203
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:31,110
Most of them do a molecular assay, and most labs don't call for all they would send it to their state public health laboratory.

204
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:34,020
There are molecular assays in some laboratories,

205
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:41,010
but there's any question and you're really worried about pertussis in your patient has not been vaccinated.

206
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:47,470
You need to get it into clinical micro lab and probably to public health.

207
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:53,860
The range of pathogens causing exacerbation of lung disease in cystic fibrosis patients,

208
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:58,420
and yes, I know that other cystic fibrosis centers in Michigan,

209
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:03,460
the University of Michigan Hospital is one of the big centers for assisted patients with cystic fibrosis.

210
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:08,080
So the range of pathogens for these patients has expanded, and specimens for micro,

211
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:12,970
bacterial and fungal cultures should be collected in some patients.

212
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:23,620
And then finally, in the immunocompromised host, you really need a broad diagnostic approach based on an invasively collected specimen.

213
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:30,820
That's something that the patient can speed up. The physician has to go in and then basically collect that specimen.

214
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:36,440
And this is from that same guide to the utilization of the microbe that I showed you.

215
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:44,540
And see the charts. I didn't want people to see the charts. OK, bronchitis, bronchitis and bronchiolitis.

216
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:52,940
So there's a difference in the two syndromes. Bronchitis is usually due to viruses.

217
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:58,190
It may be due to mycoplasma pneumoniae or chlamydia biophilia pneumonia,

218
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:05,550
but generally it starts out with viruses, whooping cough or Bordetella pertussis.

219
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:09,750
Should be considered an adolescent or young adult with a prominent cough.

220
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:14,400
Of course, the question also always has to be asked Has this person been vaccinated?

221
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:23,920
Had the full series of vaccines for pertussis? But generally, acute bronchitis is due to viruses.

222
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:31,240
Acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis is associated with the organism shown here.

223
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:39,290
Strep pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Marcella Cattrall's.

224
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:50,440
And then finally, bronchiolitis is almost always caused by viruses or an mycoplasma.

225
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:54,700
We can't culture Mycoplasma pneumoniae unless you do it in tissue culture.

226
00:26:54,700 --> 00:27:05,090
Most labs don't do tissue culture anymore, so diagnosis of viruses and mycoplasma pneumoniae is a molecular assay.

227
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:12,410
Next slide. Now we get to community acquired pneumonia, which is certainly more common in some of the things I've been talking about.

228
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:20,660
The diagnosis of community acquired pneumonia is based upon the presence of specific symptoms and radiographic features,

229
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:27,120
so the patient would have infiltrates or effusion seen on the chest x ray.

230
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,870
They usually have common ideologies, if you're seeing a lot of patients at one time,

231
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:38,400
the ideology is almost always same unless there's a recent recent travel history or exposure to certain vectors or animals.

232
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:43,830
Maybe the patient works in the zoo or something like that.

233
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:49,920
Lab diagnosis is done to focus on antibiotic management for a particular patient.

234
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:53,700
We want to get the laboratory diagnosis correct and find out what's causing the

235
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:59,110
patient's problems so that that patient can be treated with the appropriate agents.

236
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:04,300
May also have a public health significance, though, specifically legionella,

237
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:13,300
which we have a lot of legionella in here in Michigan, as well as influenza viruses, and then I hate to even put this in here.

238
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:18,490
Agents of bioterrorism. So remember, please.

239
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:25,510
Diagnosis is based upon good specimens. The laboratory staff are your best friends in infection prevention.

240
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:30,400
You make your staff your best friend. But we need to get good quality specimens.

241
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:40,140
Our tests don't work very well. So what about health care associate and ventilator associated pneumonia?

242
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:47,100
This is frequently due to multidrug resistant gram negative pathogens could be due to other bacteria,

243
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:56,070
but the most common causes are multidrug resistant gram negative bacteria, and they're extremely difficult to treat.

244
00:28:56,070 --> 00:29:05,700
The rest were viruses, as I have here, maybe most commonly transmitted but much less frequent, frequently with all of us wearing masks.

245
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:09,430
Other viruses and fungi causing respiratory diseases are pretty rare,

246
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:16,380
though not is that they will never see them, but it's much rarer than the respiratory viruses.

247
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:22,200
When we look at a smear like a gram stain smear or something like that,

248
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:29,160
and it doesn't have any inflammatory cells, and the culture has no potential pathogens,

249
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:37,050
which we know within the first 24 hours on a culture generally, unless it's T.B. or a fungus has a very high negative predictive value.

250
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:43,080
Okay. And then, of course, cultures of endotracheal aspirate go down.

251
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:51,630
You give aspirin with a to suck out the aspirin, grow more mixtures of bacteria than specimens obtained by bronchoscopy techniques.

252
00:29:51,630 --> 00:30:01,720
Because of their bronchoscopy, they go way down into the lungs, so you get a much cleaner specimen then.

253
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:11,820
What about infections of the plural space? They're usually highly microbial, and unfortunately, they're usually mixed to Arabs and Arabs.

254
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:17,220
And any significant amount of fluid should be sent sampled by person.

255
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:22,420
And he says, How do you know if this fluid, they can see it on a scan, they can see it on the x ray.

256
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:29,550
They can put a needle in, pull out and pull it out and send it to the lab to be analyzed.

257
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:37,780
Specimens should or must be immediately sent to the lab or placed into an anaerobic transport computer nowadays that works for micro,

258
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:47,730
doesn't work for hematology. So if it's coming to if you can't get it to the lab right away, put it into an anaerobic transport container.

259
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:54,090
They can also be placed in blood culture bottles, blood culture bottles for gram positive bacteria, gram negative bacteria.

260
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:59,520
And they're not real good on mold, but they grow all the others.

261
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:05,520
The lab must be notified of tuberculosis as suspected so that a micro bacterial culture can be set up.

262
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:14,930
Normally, a mycobacterial culture will not be set up unless it's specifically requested.

263
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:22,970
Right now, we're getting down to the seriously ill patients, pneumonia and immunocompromised hosts.

264
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:32,000
And here any potential pathogen can cause significant illness and that pathogen and

265
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,910
the course of the disease may be affected by recently as administered prophylaxis.

266
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:46,820
So if it's the right prophylaxis physician made the correct assessment and give patients the drug that was needed rather address as needed,

267
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:55,430
they're probably not going to be able to recover the pathogen if it's the wrong prophylaxis.

268
00:31:55,430 --> 00:32:04,430
There will be plenty of bacteria, virus fungus pathogens too that can be recovered,

269
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:07,820
and there may be more than one because with the inappropriate therapy,

270
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:15,730
you knock out the normal flora and allow other bacteria, viruses, mold, etc. to grow.

271
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:20,330
Immunocompromised patients are vulnerable to the usual bacterial viral viral

272
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:30,530
causes of both mapping and community acquired and medically acquired pneumonia.

273
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:36,200
More significant roles may be played by fungi. Herpes viruses and protozoa.

274
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:42,030
I don't think the protozoa are as significant as the fungi. Fungi are around us all the time.

275
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:48,470
Generally, the protons are not real common and the herpes herpes viruses around us all the time also.

276
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:56,420
So crews are kind of on a lower level, but they can cause a lot of disease.

277
00:32:56,420 --> 00:33:02,990
So what's the importance of the respiratory Graham state? I put it up here.

278
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:07,970
That's the importance first programs that we can tell if it's a good specimen,

279
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:13,640
if it's full of epithelial cells and no polys, it's not a good specimen.

280
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:28,040
OK. So you need to review the grams of gram stain Essop and make sure that along the way, the laboratory in general,

281
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:35,030
if you're in a big facility, as I was in Beaumont, we review procedures with our epidemiologist frequently.

282
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:42,560
But everybody needs to pay particular attention to how the gram stain is done for sputum specimens because that is

283
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:49,580
critical in determining the next steps is the patient to get antibiotics is a good specimen of bad specimen and so on.

284
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:54,330
So there are some very important ways to resolve the Graham said.

285
00:33:54,330 --> 00:34:01,760
I'm going to show you one way that most labs don't do, but does calculate what needs to be done.

286
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:12,080
So we're going to go on next slide. So a grandstand smears and lower respiratory tract secretions, as I said, provide rapid presumptive information.

287
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:15,860
They can guide presumptive and microbial therapy.

288
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:22,010
They can identify superficially contaminated specimens, and those are the ones we don't want to do much with.

289
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:34,820
And also gives you the ability to discriminate between those with organisms likely to cause infections and those with colonizing oropharyngeal flora.

290
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:40,400
So that oropharyngeal floor is very important, it really helps keep people healthy.

291
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:48,250
The resident flora and the trachea bronchial tree represent a great challenge to the interpretation and reporting of gram stain smears.

292
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:52,890
So much, so much of it depends on has the patient gotten antibiotics recently?

293
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:55,560
And that unfortunately happens too often.

294
00:34:55,560 --> 00:35:04,890
So there's a pro and con for grandstand smears on the pro side, he gives you valuable information about host cell types and predominant organisms.

295
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:09,630
You can actually do an early diagnosis for asking you to back about in that way.

296
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:15,670
Presumptive diagnosis let me say it that way it's sensitive and specific indicator of pneumococcal pneumonia.

297
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:21,270
Couple of studies I've got here a study of community acquired pneumonia and had a sensitivity of 57

298
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:28,320
percent and a specificity of 97 percent for diagnosis of Streptococcus strep streptococcal pneumonia,

299
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,330
pneumonia and the same study.

300
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:40,450
The gram stain at a sensitivity of 82 percent and a specificity of 99 percent for diagnosing Haemophilus influenza, which is great.

301
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:44,760
Remember, this is a study that's going on. This is not real life.

302
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:51,930
The authors concluded that the gram stain was highly specific and beneficial in guiding pathogen specific and microbial therapy,

303
00:35:51,930 --> 00:36:02,590
and I do agree with it is very, very useful. But we need those good specimens and everybody needs to be doing the diagnosis the same way.

304
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:08,050
This can also be very useful with patients with specimens from cystic fibrosis patients,

305
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:17,750
which are much more difficult to work up when assessing quality of the specimen and what to work out which potential pathogens to work up.

306
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:20,330
OK. There are some problems with brown stains.

307
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:31,010
Nothing is perfect, neither is the graham scene, tracheal aspirin's from mechanically ventilated, very low birth weight babies.

308
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:36,740
We have prolonged secretions from the intubation, not from the infection.

309
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:46,670
So the respiratory tract has been irritated by the intubation itself because of the irritation that virulent secretions, but not from an infection.

310
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:53,840
Many other conditions can cause proliferation of leukocytes both in the lower and the upper airways,

311
00:36:53,840 --> 00:37:00,860
so the grandstand alone should not be used to diagnose the presence of pneumonia.

312
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:11,780
It is one key factor, but it's not the only key factor once the clinical diagnosis has been determined based on clinical parameters.

313
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:18,740
Graham St. Louis used to determine the probable etiologic, agent and probable therapeutic interventions.

314
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:25,610
So you don't start with the grandstand, you start with everything else and then you walk up to the grandstand.

315
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:31,900
There are some additional issues if you use the sputum culture.

316
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:39,550
As the reference standard to which the state has compared, the sensitivity and specificity will drop,

317
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:44,290
so that's really not the best specimen to use as a reference standard.

318
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:51,220
Culture is an imperfect standard. It can be compromised in so many ways.

319
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:55,930
The wrong specimen is mostly spent and not sputum.

320
00:37:55,930 --> 00:38:05,410
Put in the wrong to transport is delay. There's many, many reasons is that the one patient could have had prior in microbial therapy,

321
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:10,720
so those factors and many others can make the sensitivity of the specificity drop down.

322
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:15,640
One study showed that half the information from a sputum culture is clinically

323
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:19,920
misleading in the absence of correlation with direct gram stain results.

324
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:29,220
So even though you have a culture that looks like it's pure strep pneumo or poor purity strep something or other,

325
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:41,140
if you don't have correlation with the cramps, then it doesn't mean much. So we we there are gram stain screening criteria,

326
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:50,050
and they are standardized to achieve consistent smear interpretations and to establish the quality of specimen submitted for analysis.

327
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:55,900
OK. And everybody doing the screening in one institution has to do it the same way.

328
00:38:55,900 --> 00:39:01,870
Fundamental to it, screening criteria is the premise that an abundance of squamous epithelial cells is

329
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:07,480
suggested of superficial oropharyngeal contamination requiring specimen re collection.

330
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:17,380
You see all those little cells, you don't do anything more. But these criteria don't don't apply to legionella species.

331
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:21,970
So you would have to set up a legionella culture to do a molecular for legionella.

332
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:24,190
It's also helpful to add an interpretive comment,

333
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:32,920
such as squamous cells in the specimen indicate the presence of superficial material that may contain contaminating or colonizing bacteria.

334
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:36,310
We can't really tell which is which. I'm related to infection.

335
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:42,250
Collection of another specimen as suggested avoiding superficial sources of contamination.

336
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:48,340
What does this mean for the nursing staff up on the floors? They won't have any idea how to do that.

337
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:56,600
So it really needs to be a one on one. Or you meet with the nursing staff, you meet with the supervisory staff and you explain what's going on.

338
00:39:56,600 --> 00:40:04,740
You explain how to get the specimen and really work with them side by side and no finger pointing.

339
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:11,220
So here's the table showing the criteria for assessing specimen quality by microscopic

340
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:17,910
screening of lower respiratory tract secretions and a number of publications.

341
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:25,590
Ray Barlow was the first when he was at Yukon and he really he, he really said,

342
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:32,580
set the standard for how to screen sputum specimens are a little less toward secretions.

343
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:38,760
So here are minimum criteria for specimen acceptance. Is any score greater than zero and others?

344
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:53,790
Marie in Washington All these people say just the presence or absence of organisms in oil and musicians of a field that's pretty that's too easygoing.

345
00:40:53,790 --> 00:41:00,960
So there's another way to score the Graham state and to use this cue score system.

346
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:09,570
So you have on one side, you have the chart, you have neutrophils that are present and on the other side you have squamous cells.

347
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:17,610
And while the neutrophils are positive, squamous cells are negative. And so this will tell you the number of potential pathogens to work up.

348
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:23,520
So if you see zero squamous cells and zero neutrophils, you better work up.

349
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:33,690
Three pathogens cause the patient and how much of an immune response if you see three neutrophils.

350
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:39,210
And zero zero squamous cells, once again, you work them all up.

351
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:48,750
But with this Q score system, zero is no cells, one is one to nine to is ten to twenty four and so on, and they're all done on a low power field.

352
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:54,840
And so here this is these are you take away, you don't add, so you take it away.

353
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:59,910
So here when you work up in these nothing, you work up nothing.

354
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:08,790
If you have to neutrophils and you have to squamous cells is just negative because it's on the top of the side.

355
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:15,150
You don't work with anything, so you have to have more neutrophils than you have squamous cells.

356
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:28,090
And this is just a way of quantifying it. So in this example, the restaurant culture is done to determine the number of potential pathogens.

357
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:37,060
If it's less than two people, what am I trying to say?

358
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:42,520
White blood cells work up less than two potential pathogens.

359
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:46,510
If it's risk for a culture, no. Is it three or four?

360
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:52,900
You refer to the gram stain for workup. And if you've got multiple organisms, OK,

361
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:56,680
you only do spot tests in rapid test no susceptibility because it probably what

362
00:42:56,680 --> 00:43:04,470
you're seeing is normal flora and not the organism that's causing all the disease.

363
00:43:04,470 --> 00:43:09,660
Okay, so you can also do it this way, which is a little bit easier than the Q score system.

364
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:13,080
If the Mirror has greater than 25 polymorph or nuclear missiles in less than

365
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:17,850
10 epithelial cells as part of a Part B is greater than 25 and less than 25.

366
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:24,210
Opportunities in Part C is greater than 10 polys per epithelial cells, with a ratio of 10 to one.

367
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:26,690
So you can do it up here and what it says is the limit.

368
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:33,150
Choose any of these criteria to judge the acceptability of sputum specimens, depending on local patient demographics.

369
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:37,850
So if you're getting a lot of patients from nursing homes.

370
00:43:37,850 --> 00:43:46,400
Probably they're going to have plenty of time off for nuclear self, but some elderly patients may not be able to make them.

371
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:54,210
And you just need to see more pollies per epithelial cell is the ratio of 10 to one.

372
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:59,550
So if the sputum specimens don't meet any acceptability criteria, they they're rejected.

373
00:43:59,550 --> 00:44:10,140
Remember, we used the Thousand X on the microscope, so 10x on the ocular 100 X on the on the lens to to observe it in a thousand.

374
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:15,420
Yes, some of the microscopes go up to twelve hundred and it really works very well.

375
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:23,200
You have to have more polyps than squamous epithelial cells, however you count them.

376
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:31,690
So you can say no organism seeing mixed Flora, no one more fat Typekit greater than 10 organisms in the oil emerging field mixed flora in

377
00:44:31,690 --> 00:44:36,100
which there are two or more and more four times greater than 10 organisms per oilfield.

378
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:40,570
One more time in concentrations of less than 10 organisms for oil field.

379
00:44:40,570 --> 00:44:45,310
Or one more for type in concentrations greater than 10. The 10 organisms for oil fields.

380
00:44:45,310 --> 00:44:49,360
So there are all these choices. OK.

381
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:55,460
And by examining that flight, it is hard to think about it when you're not sitting at a microscope, looking at this way,

382
00:44:55,460 --> 00:45:03,070
when you're if you do this time after time, you say, OK, I'm seeing massive colleagues and very few epithelial cells.

383
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:09,040
And the majority of the bacterial cells I'm seeing are brand of cockfighting piers, a strip mall.

384
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:15,100
It's got to be worked out, OK? So that's the type of thing that you think about.

385
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:24,590
OK. So great, I'm seeing Lauren Graham say the really important investment in all cultures they do, but especially in restaurant cultures.

386
00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:31,190
You review the slide for the predominate predominant that you're more four types associated with white blood cells and

387
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:37,580
not adhering to the epithelial cells appearing in epithelial cells will pay attention to cold pathogen may be present.

388
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:44,750
There may be stealth organisms, so fungi TBE legionella.

389
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:48,920
If you think about fungi, the useful gram stain the mold will not.

390
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:53,990
Mycobacterium species will be very friendly and negative, but not very well.

391
00:45:53,990 --> 00:46:00,590
You know, doesn't go very well, either. Multiple microorganisms and a good specimen may indicate aspiration pneumonia.

392
00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:10,490
So if you've got lots of colleagues, very few epithelial cells and a plethora of different types of bacteria may be an aspiration pneumonia.

393
00:46:10,490 --> 00:46:18,530
So unfortunately, many patients are started on antibiotics before they collect the specimen.

394
00:46:18,530 --> 00:46:22,790
And interpretation is very difficult if the patient has been starved of antibiotics per specimen

395
00:46:22,790 --> 00:46:29,270
collection and you may need the blood may need to put disclaimers on the test results with Bernstein.

396
00:46:29,270 --> 00:46:40,530
Results can be due to variability in special specimen sampling, but no quantitation because their bodies have.

397
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:48,840
Really, miss must have the ability to do the connotation, but you do report white blood cells.

398
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:54,480
OK. That is the end of this slideshow, I've got one more today.

399
00:46:54,480 --> 00:47:06,170
The only questions about the Graham staying. OK, let me take a quick you guys can take a quick break, come back in five minutes if you need to.

400
00:47:06,170 --> 00:47:10,670
I mean, do come back, but let me take a quick break here.

401
00:47:10,670 --> 00:47:14,280
