1
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,000
Now that we've discussed the core functions of public health,

2
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:17,790
I want to take some time to discuss some of the larger issues related to the public health system itself,

3
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,720
and then consider some of the challenges that are facing public health.

4
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:30,840
So while public health has played a critical role in improving the health of our citizens, it's actually seen a steady decline in public investment.

5
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:36,060
If you look at the difference of expenditures between public health and medical care,

6
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:42,040
you'll see that national expenditures on public health in the U.S. are approximately $50

7
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:47,670
billion compared to the three and a half trillion dollars that we invest in medical care.

8
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:59,270
Big difference. From 2007 to 2010, 19% of the public health workforce was lost, and the remaining workforce continues to age.

9
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:04,120
As government and large organizations look for efficiency,

10
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:10,660
there have been large movements toward consolidation and shared services across health departments.

11
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:18,550
So you can imagine the trade offs start taking place every day around which health programs to fund and not fund.

12
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:22,930
So what are some of the major attributes of public health then?

13
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:29,050
Well, first, going back to what we talked about earlier, the core values that we discussed,

14
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:33,670
those are really an extremely critical part of Public Health's offering.

15
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:40,660
Being able to offer core values that really speak to how to address public health challenges.

16
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:48,360
The ability to address the health of society through a focus on assessment, policy, development and assurance.

17
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:53,160
Those open up large opportunities for protecting our population.

18
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:56,520
Now, if you think about the people working in public health.

19
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:05,820
Public health is a field made up of dedicated professionals who have worked tirelessly over many years to deliver evidence based solutions.

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,840
And those are solutions to larger health problems. Now, I can imagine you would know some of the different people perhaps,

21
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,890
or you might start encountering some of the different people who are working in public health.

22
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:24,810
And you can see how much dedication it takes to provide public health services, prevention and wellness.

23
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:30,270
Those are key pieces to reducing disease burden and with a strong emphasis on science.

24
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:35,940
Public health is able to address health challenges that might not actually get addressed at the individual level.

25
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:42,330
So building on these attributes, then it's probably a good idea to actually think about some of the challenges one by one.

26
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:48,060
So let's talk about them a little bit. First, there's always a pervasive distrust of government,

27
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:54,510
and I'm sure you've encountered that before when you've watched the news or listen to debates around different issues.

28
00:02:54,870 --> 00:03:00,060
There's a distrust of government that usually stems from either a moral or religious opposition,

29
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,780
and it can appear as an attack on the public health authority itself.

30
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:12,190
So for example, if I disagree with the core idea that the government should be involved in health decisions for the public at all,

31
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:16,180
well, then I might resist all public health interventions.

32
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:26,530
And so we see this play out, especially on reproductive health issues, where there's a moral struggle over whether public health has a role at all.

33
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:36,160
So before we even begin to address how public health could be involved, we're already seeing skepticism over its involvement in the first place.

34
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:44,680
So another challenge facing public health is then the shift from government driven programs to private sector driven initiatives.

35
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:52,990
If the government decides to cut large programs from the local, state or federal budget, who takes over responsibility?

36
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:59,090
At the same time, maybe the private sector should have just been responsible for this in the first place.

37
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:03,180
A government funded substance abuse clinic.

38
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:09,150
Well, that might be set up to provide treatment in neighborhoods that face a prevalence of opioid addiction.

39
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:13,230
But there may be opposition to government being involved here at all.

40
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:21,480
So this brings us to another challenge that public health is always faced with, and that is political opposition.

41
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:25,110
Politics plays a role in all parts of public health.

42
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:28,260
From the way we enact policies to the authority,

43
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:35,520
we grant those who are set up to assess health challenges to the assurance services we expect our public health workforce to provide.

44
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:43,969
So let's take an example. If a veterans health organization is receiving government funding for health services, this might be helping,

45
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:51,050
as you might imagine, a large population of veterans and military families who wouldn't otherwise have access to these services.

46
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,790
Now, let's think about what happens if the funding becomes politicized.

47
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,829
Well, a big debate starts happening and all of a sudden the ability for public health to

48
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:06,890
serve this population that really needs to be served is significantly compromised.

49
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:14,960
Now, I can think of another challenge that I actually believe really contributes to that politicization, and that's communication.

50
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:22,100
Communicating about public health is really, really hard, and often we're faced with complex concepts,

51
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,420
complex principles that we need to help the public understand.

52
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,490
Think about the Affordable Care Act.

53
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:38,510
Back when it was passed in 2010, one of the most pervasive challenges facing the public health community was explaining how to access coverage.

54
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:45,020
How does this big law work? How do you actually benefit from the policy in the way it was intended?

55
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:54,480
People were confused and it was up to the public health community to help explain what they needed to do to get coverage.

56
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:59,390
So communication is really, really important and it can be very challenging.

57
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:09,230
Another challenge in public health is the ability to attract and retain qualified professionals like you when there's a shortage of resources.

58
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:16,760
It can be difficult to attract the best talent, and of course, it's even harder to retain those that are performing at a high level.

59
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,000
Yet another challenge.

60
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:27,340
Thinking back to our discussion of public health values is that there's often a reluctance to invest now for uncertain future benefits.

61
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:33,309
So I want you to think about if you're sitting down with a policymaker or a stakeholder and you're advocating

62
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:39,490
for an investment in a program that will yield positive results in five or ten or 15 or 20 years,

63
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:43,630
that's a tough sell. There's no immediate guaranteed outcome.

64
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:51,070
I can't see what's actually going to happen. And you're asking me to believe that something positive will take place in the future.

65
00:06:51,430 --> 00:07:00,690
That's very challenging. And finally, there are challenges related to deciding which public health initiatives have the highest priority for funding.

66
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:03,990
So back to our discussion of limited resources.

67
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:12,900
Very often there are so many tradeoffs that must be considered to decide which programs will get what funding.

68
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:20,790
If you've got a program designed to reduce teen pregnancy and a program to alter smoking behavior, they're both evidence based.

69
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:26,040
They both have great attributes. They both have good cases for why you should fund them.

70
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:34,410
How are you supposed to decide which one to fund? So as you can see the attributes and challenges of public health,

71
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:42,780
they leave us with a lot of opportunities to consider different frameworks for approaching public health programs and interventions.
