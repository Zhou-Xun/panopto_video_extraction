1
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:13,370
But I think. Okay.

2
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,750
And then we'll get started now. So.

3
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:23,540
I'd like to I'm going to give a brief introduction.

4
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:35,200
Question. Is there a way for you to get us access to the cameras to block access and access night to January nights?

5
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,890
Are you okay?

6
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:46,550
That'll make you who you really.

7
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:26,590
Okay. That's take a few minutes a day in this world where everything you.

8
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:38,540
Do. Yeah.

9
00:01:54,660 --> 00:02:01,490
Of the. Well, it's not published.

10
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,140
They actually work and.

11
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:21,790
And it's like the other weeks are published. So there you go.

12
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,800
And access now. Yeah. Okay.

13
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:31,760
Okay. I guess so. Keep that up and just in case, then.

14
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:43,130
So we'll do. I'll do a brief introduction to transmission modeling.

15
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:51,420
Mainly this is to give you a really about you reorienting yourself on what models are.

16
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:57,680
And because everybody's used to statistical models and these mechanistic models people are less familiar with.

17
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:59,940
So this is a brief introduction to that.

18
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:11,610
Then we'll do a round of introductions so I can get a sense of your interests and your back a little bit more about your background and such.

19
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:17,070
And then we'll go over the quiz. Just a brief review.

20
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:24,240
Again, the quiz was really meant for me to get a general sense of what your everyone's math background is,

21
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:30,240
and then I'll going to go over one and then there is three videos assigned.

22
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,400
They're going to go over the mass action video.

23
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:38,430
So again, it's a pretty important video with respect to conceptually understanding how transmission models work.

24
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:45,229
Then I'll talk a little bit about part two of the zero nine exponential model,

25
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:51,379
just to get us orient everybody to that and then we have time for some discussion

26
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:59,000
questions to for you all to talk about in smaller groups with respect to the video.

27
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,400
Edit Videos History of Mathematical Modeling Video.

28
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,750
Any questions on logistics of the course or anything so far with respect to Vlad?

29
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:17,990
And then everybody was here for Lab zero, but I think I got everyone started and I'm working on the labs.

30
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:23,660
The idea with the lab because everyone's getting started different time.

31
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:30,380
We're going to start lab one on Wednesday, but Lab zero won't be two till the following week.

32
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:46,490
And same thing. You had two weeks also for this first lab, so and so I talked a little bit about this briefly last on Wednesday,

33
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:57,469
but I want to just reiterate this idea about what we've about market mechanism models and the role of mechanistic models in science in general,

34
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:02,600
in epidemiology specifically. So from from my perspective,

35
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:07,130
I think about these models is really a theoretical foundation for epidemiology

36
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:13,460
and specifically transmission modeling is for infectious disease epidemiology.

37
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:25,370
And I like to use ecology as an example or exemplar of how it how it works and can work as a theoretical framework for people in it.

38
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,290
If you're an ecology student and you're taking an intro ecology course,

39
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:38,990
you're going to be talking about long term models that that describe how great predators interact.

40
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:47,360
You'll be talking about those competition models that talk about how different species compete for different resources.

41
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:52,220
And those are ordinary differential equation models, just like the models that we'll be talking about.

42
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:58,400
And they really are the basis for how people, how ecologists think about how species interact.

43
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:03,590
And in the real world, it's always much more complicated than the models that we'll be talking about,

44
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:12,139
but that it gives you this theoretical framework for thinking about how to move and how to understand in ecology,

45
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:15,680
species, interaction, and in our case here,

46
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:28,160
how to think about how infectious diseases are transmitted through populations and how best we can intervene upon these pathogens.

47
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:38,390
So these mechanisms, models are often dynamic, and we'll talk a lot about throughout this course what we mean by dynamic.

48
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:46,670
Well, I'll introduce this in that and it was introduced in the mass action video and we'll talk about that more today.

49
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,790
But I also have a specific video on dynamics and what I mean by dynamics.

50
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,520
But for now, the you know,

51
00:06:54,590 --> 00:07:09,710
we can think about dynamics as time bearing processes where what's happening in the present is determining what's going to happen in the future.

52
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:17,450
And our models describe what's happening in the present so that we can then predict what's happening in the future.

53
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:20,660
And we'll so again, we'll talk about this in a lot more detail.

54
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:32,950
There's a lot of dynamic processes in. In the world where we're going to be focusing on pathogen transmission models.

55
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:36,490
Feed and transport also is highly dynamic.

56
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:45,550
The idea that pathogens can survive in the environment, we think about it in water and food and then with COVID.

57
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:48,850
More and more, we're thinking also about the air and aerosolization,

58
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:59,290
how pathogens survive their fate and how they moved through the environment is a dynamic process.

59
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:04,900
Ecosystems. We talked about the logic of their models and the competition models.

60
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:09,670
Ecosystems are highly dynamic, social processes are highly dynamic.

61
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:17,350
And we see that unfolding with COVID and we see that unfolding with a lot of processes

62
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:28,929
where there's externalities that influence how people respond to different situations.

63
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:38,500
And there is individual behavior that is that is affected by that within host disease processes, also highly dynamic.

64
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:47,799
What happens when a pathogen is you ingest a pathogen or a pathogen, you become infected by hydrogen and the immune system.

65
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:52,660
And how they respond, how your immune system responds to that infection is very dynamic.

66
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:55,750
And the behavior, I guess, is linked to social processes.

67
00:08:56,050 --> 00:09:04,500
Peer pressure is a great example, a dynamic process that the more people that are smoking around you, the more likely you're going to smoke.

68
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:09,870
And so you can think about these behavioral processes as family dynamics.

69
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:16,989
So again, we're going to be focusing mostly on pathogen transmission, but we're going talking a little bit about food and transport.

70
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:21,280
And and we're going to be talking about population dynamics and how that folds into because

71
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:27,580
those are both very important dynamic processes that impact trade and at transmission.

72
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:38,080
But I also want to emphasize that even though this course focuses on infectious disease processes we can address,

73
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:42,850
there's a lot of dynamic noninfectious disease processes.

74
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:54,070
Mostly they're really these last three points how social processes interact with within host disease processes and behavioral processes.

75
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,670
And you learn a lot.

76
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:08,170
You can learn a lot about that in we have a chronic disease modeling course that Michael here actually teaches that focuses on noninfectious diseases.

77
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:14,260
And there's been a lot longer history of using these dynamic mechanistic models in infectious disease processes.

78
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:23,230
And so there's just a lot more literature on it from dynamic modeling for infectious processes.

79
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:30,620
So I mentioned this. Also briefly on Wednesday.

80
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:33,950
But this course I see has three levels of content.

81
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:37,890
The first is you're learning to use MATLAB.

82
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:46,490
This is a simulation and analysis package is similar to our but it has much more of a focus on dynamics.

83
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:51,680
Very used a lot in the field of engineering, less so in public health.

84
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:58,680
And it's very, again, similar to ours. So a lot is vector oriented just like ours.

85
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:03,229
So hopefully it's relatively easy.

86
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:10,940
And since more and more of our students know our the learning curve to learn to adapt to MATLAB, it's a lot easier.

87
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:26,730
So the second level is learning how to both first actually analyze transmission models.

88
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:34,800
Much of the lab we're going to be doing, you're going to be handed the model and you're going to be looking at it and analyzing it.

89
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:43,790
And but slowly, more and more, you're going to be doing heading towards learning how to develop mathematical models also,

90
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:51,780
which is more of an art form. There's not a recipe on how to develop and how to evolve a specific mathematical model.

91
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:58,320
And yet a lot of it depends on the research question that you're asking, what model you want to develop.

92
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:06,390
So that is a lot longer timeframe, kind of a learning curve with respect to learning how to develop.

93
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:12,000
But that's kind of the second level of what you get at this course.

94
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,960
And the last level is what I mentioned at the beginning,

95
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:22,830
learning how models can provide as a theoretical framework for helping us design

96
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:26,880
epidemiology studies in this case and helping us design intervention studies.

97
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:33,270
So I see these this of course giving you this these three levels of content.

98
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:38,430
So a little bit about why we use mathematical models.

99
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:43,830
And again, when I'm talking about mathematical models and talking about these dynamic mechanistic models,

100
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:49,290
so these mechanistic models reflect the known causal relationship of a given system.

101
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:54,209
And so you are you know, I mentioned this over and over again,

102
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:59,730
you're actually creating a complex hypothesis when you present a model and you use a

103
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:05,970
model to try and understand what's happening with respect to a given transmission system.

104
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:10,080
And it's a form of really data reduction.

105
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:22,170
And in that once you codify what you think is happening, it eliminates a lot of possibilities basically, and that actually reduces dimension.

106
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:30,000
So machine learning is the exact opposite. You just throw everything in, you don't assume anything, and you see what the data says about it.

107
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:35,400
Um, are probably giving disease process here.

108
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:39,080
We're saying, well, actually we do know something about the disease process.

109
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:46,139
Let's modify that and then we, we limit the possibilities, reduce this dimensionality problem in this cursor.

110
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:53,310
Dimensionality problem is huge with respect to machine learning and its limitations as a machine learning because once you have it,

111
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:58,800
you get into ten, 20, 30 variables. You can't have enough data.

112
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:08,190
There's no way you can have data actually say completely, empirically, without any theory what's going on.

113
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:16,409
So one example of this is that, you know, we can with our models, our models, we can distinguish between measles,

114
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:22,350
malaria and HIV cholera, because we can assume measles is directly transmitted disease.

115
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:27,570
Malaria is a vector borne. It requires a mosquito intermediary to transmit.

116
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:31,799
HIV is sexually transmitted, cholera is waterborne.

117
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:39,690
So it's again an example in which the pathogen can survive in the environment and people are exposed to the pathogen via the environment.

118
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:47,520
So we can structurally distinguish between these pathogens through our model.

119
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:51,360
And a third,

120
00:14:51,540 --> 00:15:01,980
second way in which models are useful is that they act as data integrators we can be collecting and ecologists collect a lot of important information.

121
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:06,810
Entomologist specifically about mosquitoes, they're inviting rate their longevity.

122
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:14,669
We get a lot of information about through medicine, about the disease process and the sequelae that occur.

123
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:20,040
We get a lot of information about from microbiologists about the actual property of the pathogen.

124
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:30,990
We can integrate all those data very rigorously and structurally in a very structured way, in a mathematical model, in a in a mechanistic model.

125
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:33,600
And again, as I mentioned before.

126
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:47,890
The model itself takes on this complex hypothesis, and that way mechanistic modeling is a lot more about generating hypotheses,

127
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:52,840
whereas often with statistical models, you're actually trying to test hypotheses.

128
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:57,700
That's one one difference they like to emphasize, and again,

129
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:04,750
that they can be a fuzzy line because we can use mechanistic models like we used that in figure models and analyzing epidemic curves.

130
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:18,880
And then it's then it's actually a combination of, again, testing hypotheses and generating hypotheses, some benefits of modeling.

131
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:24,590
In initially can identify important knowledge gaps.

132
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:32,630
So even before you there's a lot of data models can actually highlight where more data is needed.

133
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:39,980
The moment that we we saw that COVID was more aerosol and less droplet.

134
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:49,520
We need to know a lot more about the properties of COVID with respect to its ability to survive in the air and be transported in the air.

135
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:59,750
It can provide insights into processes that can be empirically tested that basically what I just been talking about,

136
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:02,149
we can generate hypotheses about example,

137
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:17,660
for example, how antibiotics are spread through transmission systems or through the use of antibiotics and or exposure to contaminated poultry,

138
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:18,290
for instance.

139
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:31,040
And then we can inform new studies that can be done to collect more data and either validate the model or actually reject some aspects of the model,

140
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:34,940
forcing us to rethink some of our assumptions about the model.

141
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:42,029
And so again and then as I just said,

142
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:52,200
we can talk about the direction for what future research activities we need to be moving towards with respect to modeling.

143
00:17:55,140 --> 00:18:00,030
And again, as I mentioned, we need see an explicit description of the system as this theoretical framework.

144
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:06,960
The other thing I like to emphasize here is that as scientists, we're always working with a conceptual model.

145
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:15,560
So we're always trying to reduce. The complexity of what's actually happening there in some sort of conceptual way.

146
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:19,460
And that's how we actually decide what kind of experiments we do.

147
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:25,910
So mathematical modeling is just you're just codifying the conceptual model in mathematical

148
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:32,420
equations so that you can ask a lot of what if questions in simulations that we'll be doing again,

149
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:37,350
how much? Detail we put in the model depends on the research question.

150
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:43,470
We're not again trying to replicate reality with all its complexities,

151
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:52,770
but we're trying to add enough of the dynamics of what we see in order to be useful.

152
00:18:53,910 --> 00:19:02,100
And so COBE is a great example. Do we need to account for what's happening in the environment or not with our models?

153
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:06,180
Most of the models don't. They're being used right now for COVID.

154
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:12,929
But there's going to be situations where we're going to ask questions about aerosolization,

155
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:19,919
where, you know, you can pattern, you can survive for hours in the air in a restaurant.

156
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:26,540
So you could be on one side of the restaurant and be infectious in somebody and the other side of the restaurant.

157
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,700
And we've never had any direct contact with you may become exposed.

158
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:35,220
So may become important to actually account for that environmental process.

159
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:47,250
But this actually encapsulates nicely, at least my philosophical perspective on modeling by Edelstein Cash.

160
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:55,180
The importance of simple models stem from not stem, not from the realism or the accuracy of their predictions,

161
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:59,560
but rather from the simple and fundamental principles they set forth.

162
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:03,069
The idea, from my perspective as a model,

163
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:11,650
is much more powerful as an explanatory tool to help us gain insight than it is to predict when the next peak is.

164
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:22,900
And these are three examples one in infectious disease, two in ecology that really highlights this philosophy.

165
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:35,590
The first, and you in the history of epidemiology, when I went over in the video, the McKendrick Model in the late 1920s,

166
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:43,630
where that model suggested this threshold dependance of epidemics on population size.

167
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:54,130
And that concept from a very simple model that we'll be using quite a bit in this class really as a driving force for thinking about vaccine.

168
00:20:54,520 --> 00:21:01,270
The question of herd immunity that we've been talking about with COVID and the idea that if we can drive the number of samples below a threshold,

169
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:11,020
we can prevent epidemics from happening. We get this not from some big complicated model, but from very, very basic what we call our model.

170
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:20,050
I mentioned this also already that Lofa or her model, prey predator model.

171
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:29,020
And one of my one of the videos goes into this a little bit, but it predicts that there that the prepared system will isolate.

172
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:40,920
As the prey populations increase to a high level, predators will start exploiting that resource and consuming a lot of prey.

173
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:47,190
Their populations will increase to the point where they, however, exploit the prey populations which will then crash.

174
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:56,010
Once they crash, then the predator populations crash it to a point where it allows them prey populations increase again.

175
00:21:56,340 --> 00:22:00,870
So this oscillation is something that's predicted by this logic in our model,

176
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:09,690
and we see it actually in this Wolf Meier Wolf Moose population in our royale in Northern Michigan.

177
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:15,810
They've been shown this oscillation. Oscillatory behaviors have been occurring for decades.

178
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:27,720
Often it doesn't. Often we don't see it because a lot of externalities and complicated factors that interrupt this oscillation.

179
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:34,760
But again, it's a fundamental. Um, concept that is highlighted in these,

180
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:45,270
these simple models and then this competition model where there's a tendency when two species are competing for the same resource,

181
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:48,330
that one will exclude the other one without the other.

182
00:22:48,720 --> 00:23:00,480
And that comes in the 1930s by Gauss and MacArthur with his competitors, this competition model.

183
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:10,439
And so these are just three examples where this highlights this philosophical perspective that will be taken.

184
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:17,249
So this class will not be about developing large simulation based models or individual

185
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:25,229
based models that can account for the spread of a pathogen in the city of Seattle,

186
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:32,250
where you actually, you know, account for transportation processes and all the complexities in a population.

187
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:36,660
These are going to be much more simple models that give us conceptual insight.

188
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:43,380
So there's different types of models.

189
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:52,230
We already talked about the difference between a statistical model, which is really a data driven model, and your art.

190
00:23:52,230 --> 00:24:00,100
The form or a physical model is based on the kinds of data we collect as opposed to the mechanistic model, which is more of a process driven model.

191
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:05,200
There's also deterministic models.

192
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:11,940
And a German model is every time you run the simulation, you'll get the same exact result.

193
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:21,510
As opposed to a sarcastic model which brain builds in stochastic city so that you know what happens when you are dealing with small numbers.

194
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:26,970
So the same you know, the same one simulation.

195
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,120
The outbreak may occur in simulation and may die out.

196
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:40,799
And it's a stochastic process that it is to process determine fix models are simpler but don't can capture this random random process,

197
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:48,180
whereas the classic models are more realistic. But adding complexity models can also be continuous or discrete.

198
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:55,270
Population processes are infectious disease processes are actually discrete events as a

199
00:24:55,270 --> 00:25:02,829
transmission event that happens at a specific time and they happen in discrete events.

200
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:09,190
But it's often convenient to think about population growth, for instance, is a continuous process.

201
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,880
So there's you'll see discrete models in continuous models.

202
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:21,309
And then I already talk a little bit about these analytic models being equation based models versus computational models,

203
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:33,520
like when you are a model of transmission in a in the city of Seattle, for instance, there are two different types of models that exist in literature.

204
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:41,320
So for this class, we're going to be dealing with mechanistic models, deterministic that are deterministic, continuous and analytic.

205
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:45,740
And so that and we're doing that both for that, you know,

206
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:51,070
philosophical perspective that these are the kind of models that give us explanatory insight.

207
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:55,680
And also, this is a good way to start learning about this.

208
00:25:55,810 --> 00:26:04,690
It's good to learn about these analytic models that are deterministic before you move on to stochastic process models and individual based models.

209
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:16,800
So. Just stand here to train just our course, respected as has been reiterated,

210
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:24,900
and our act as theoretical framework to inform study design intervention strategies,

211
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:31,350
provide inference on factors associated transmission and actually can be developed and

212
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:36,420
used to develop new estimates for measuring disease frequency a measure of effect.

213
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:40,500
We'll talk a little bit more about that in the class and epidemiology.

214
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:53,780
This should be a more theory based. Field, in my opinion, where models can provide that useful theoretical framework for developing that theory.

215
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:02,360
So that is the introductory lecture.

216
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:07,430
So before we move on to looking at the quiz,

217
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:16,669
I thought it would be good to go around everyone's meeting and introduce themselves and what program

218
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:23,040
they're in and also what what interests them or why they're taking this course to actually start with.

219
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:27,310
Oh, I actually saw that. Yeah.

220
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:32,170
Were Audrey's our great integrator for the class that's going. I help with the discussion sections.

221
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:39,350
So she's there. Thank you. My name is Peter, a master's degree with public policy and computational biology.

222
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:43,800
This is a required class for kind competition program.

223
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,790
I'm very interested in transmission.

224
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:59,450
And one of the projects I decided to work on is a dengue forecasting tool for Vietnam, as well as of your project in Ecuador,

225
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:08,960
in terms of identifying improvements to the index to inform force of infections for TB.

226
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:24,760
I enjoy I am a massive swimmer provide a step ahead and in this course was an interesting I guess in reason.

227
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:39,010
I also a conversation about the program so it's also very personal but I guess during the first season I saw how

228
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:52,080
some early signs of it and I want it to also help me to get more involved with commodity prices and things.

229
00:28:55,020 --> 00:29:05,980
Hi. Q I'm a currency advisor and be student in group B and asking this question mostly because I'm interested in U.S. chasing down.

230
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:12,800
I'm Sophia. I'm a first year student as well.

231
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:18,680
I've shown similar interest in you. I tell you this cause it's sort of an elective.

232
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:27,620
It's also another person. Whereas I have interest in an infectious disease epidemiologist, specifically about waterborne diseases.

233
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:32,150
I'm interested in learning more about this course,

234
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:41,840
and I'm interested in research that's focused on how the geography of these diseases is going to change and not just.

235
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:52,500
My name is the difference between myself and I haven't done much about infectious diseases.

236
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:01,990
My next moving story. And that was a personal decision against me.

237
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:11,590
And just just wondering if that it was an anomaly.

238
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:18,240
I'm just not sure how to transmit the that.

239
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:28,540
Mean, it is the second year in a row of extreme exposure to the virus disease.

240
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:40,690
So, of course, I was sent here to see an infectious disease because this is the transmission management and prevention.

241
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:49,900
I want to get an idea of how long we have important that we need you to do that.

242
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:53,940
And I really appreciate the first paragraph of that because of course,

243
00:30:54,090 --> 00:31:06,510
I had one segment that I was going to make I'm interested about because really I'm working on Type one diabetes,

244
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:14,230
but we're looking to model COXSACKIEVIRUS that is a precursor to, you know, these incidents.

245
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:23,410
I think it's important to look a bit more about what I wrote there on the second year.

246
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:34,910
There was no research on the vaccine efficacy and vaccines and you know, it's important interest.

247
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:43,150
Hello, my name is Peter. I'm from the government first year student.

248
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:55,060
I'm working on the Arbovirus. I then gave some research about how immune correlates.

249
00:31:56,470 --> 00:32:04,360
So how immune or features can correlate on protection or risk prevention.

250
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:11,270
But also this study protocols like the complexion immunity stories.

251
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:17,650
So I think in this class it's kind of required for me to be selective.

252
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:22,180
So I want to understand why that is infectious from.

253
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,040
Great. Thanks. Yeah.

254
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:36,670
So I started teaching this class actually in 1998, and at that point it was mildly considered a very much of a fringe topic, anatomy ology.

255
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:39,190
And so most people, if I ask the question in there,

256
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:46,210
it would mostly be like they don't know anything about transmission or even when it was seemed like this, of course, title.

257
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:55,870
And over the years, it's become more and more of an integral part of epidemiology and more and more even in health departments.

258
00:32:55,870 --> 00:33:07,170
And COVID actually accelerated that movement into transmission models being actually used in health departments to actually think about mitigation.

259
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:11,889
So that was interesting to hear where people are coming from with respect,

260
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:20,650
they might have taken this course, but it is becoming more and more of an integral part of the field.

261
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:27,200
So. Are you?

262
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:38,420
We all the. I want to go over the quiz. And I posted the solutions actually for the quiz.

263
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:51,980
And it's fairly detailed. I feel like that, um, yeah, most people, some of the people some people got the, a few people got big logarithm question.

264
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:59,150
Correct. And some of them some of you maybe made it to like a third step.

265
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:07,040
And then you remember your the basic rules of logarithms and such.

266
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:10,219
So. Um. The solution?

267
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:17,390
I don't know. I'm not going to go over the actual solution there, but if anybody has any questions, feel free to ask me.

268
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:25,220
Also, the Khan Academy resource that I posted is a great resource with respect to logarithms.

269
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:37,040
And again, the solution actually goes over that and we'll see in the first few weeks of class the

270
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:43,489
importance of logarithms is the fact that populations tend to grow and modeling populations.

271
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:52,190
Exponential growth is a good model and we'll be thinking about logarithms and that from that perspective, is it possible to upgrade backwards?

272
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:56,060
So that's where we play, because I remember what I said because I'm just like, Very good.

273
00:34:56,710 --> 00:35:03,810
Oh, yeah. So.

274
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:10,980
You won't be doing a lot of manipulations of equations.

275
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:16,890
And that's like this question I've asked most people.

276
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:23,310
I think everyone got the unit questions right. Again, units are going to be important because.

277
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:35,460
The difference. You have to know what the units are of your parameters are as you're going to get artifacts out of actual results.

278
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:43,379
And that's often a big mistake that's made that you got to make sure that the units are all in agreement on the left side of the equation.

279
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:49,560
On the right side of the equation, you're dealing with days. You got to be consistent, all your friends of the days and such.

280
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:55,710
So just understanding how to convert units is a useful part of this course.

281
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:01,110
And the discredited part. It's already set up.

282
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:04,860
It's already set up that way. You just want to see your quiz responses.

283
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:10,020
Yeah, but it's not letting you ever come.

284
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:18,330
You'll just end graphing the function. I think some people didn't get that quite right.

285
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:27,030
But again, we'll be going over you being able to graph nonlinear functions just qualitatively by, you know,

286
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:35,730
what's what happens when X equals zero, what happens when X equals infinity and goes a long way and allows you to kind of get a sense of it?

287
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:40,770
Qualitative, you know, it's nonlinear and decreasing or non-linear increasing.

288
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:47,960
Again, the solutions should be able to provide you with those.

289
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:51,480
I didn't get that right. Um, a sense of what we're looking for.

290
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:56,670
And then the. Systems equation. I think almost everybody got that right.

291
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,320
The calculus questions.

292
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:12,360
I know that was just getting a sense of how much it was people had remembered or I think actually a good proportion got that right.

293
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:17,940
I wouldn't need to worry about just knowing how to take derivatives for this class.

294
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:24,830
And again, with that differential equation core question, I don't think anybody got right.

295
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:28,410
We'll be going over that in detail over the next two weeks.

296
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:35,340
And so not to worry about that at all.

297
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:40,070
And then the last I think most people got the last two for a loop.

298
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:45,510
We're going to go over how far loops work because you're going to be writing scripts at the beginning.

299
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:53,909
The script will be completely written for you. And then as you move on, we'll be taking details out so that you'll be writing some of the scripts,

300
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:59,070
but understanding how for loops work and such are is important.

301
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:03,720
And so we'll be going over that and starting next week, starting on Wednesday.

302
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:13,349
But so that gives you a sense of what the kinds of math that we're going to be using here.

303
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:24,480
Again, very little statistics, but much more algebra and sort of programing types of skill sets for this course.

304
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:32,990
Any questions on. Okay.

305
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:41,879
So, um, so the quizzes from now on are going to be 5 minutes long and they're, oh, they're going to be conceptual.

306
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:45,450
So they're actually the purpose of the quiz from here on out is really.

307
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:50,600
You're going to be doing a lot of details, manipulation in the labs.

308
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:58,670
But I want to get a sense of that to the degree that people are getting the concepts also so that these are going to be all conceptual questions.

309
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:06,650
If you have again, question I was going to ask if they consider this now like a refresher.

310
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:12,430
And so it was like a short sale or.

311
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:18,210
So is it going to be based on lectures or readings or videos?

312
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:24,010
And you said it'll be a combination of videos and lecture material.

313
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:35,860
So most of the videos capture actually and I did that because it captures most of the conceptually what I'm after in the class.

314
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:41,200
So that so we have the videos and I'm not sure we're going to have time for how much time we'll have for discussion.

315
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:51,710
But the idea will be that we'll have some a little bit more discussion time to make sure people understand the concept behind those videos.

316
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:58,180
But today it's going to be about videos and the lecture material.

317
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:04,280
All the readings in for the class should be supporting it.

318
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:08,499
They're just they're they're just readings that can support you and give you more

319
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:13,510
additional information or a different way to present the concepts that I'm presenting.

320
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:22,469
So one of the videos was on mass action.

321
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:25,530
So I wanted to go over that. Right now.

322
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:41,200
Because I think this. This piece is its critical, critical conceptual piece to that understanding.

323
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:43,970
What do we mean by transmission models and what do we mean?

324
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:52,100
It's getting into what we mean by a dynamic model and what the last part will be looking at.

325
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:59,300
We'll be looking at two types of transmission models, basically, one that we're we're going to be use using most in the course.

326
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:08,030
But just in the last part, the second part, the Red Cross model is what we'll be focusing on in the next lab.

327
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:16,370
So this idea of the law of mass action, governing transmission,

328
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:24,470
it all came from this conceptual way of thinking about transmission comes from chemical reactions.

329
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:33,020
The idea is that if you've got a vat of chemicals, let's say, you know,

330
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:46,910
aqueous solution, you've got chemicals and be moving around homogeneously in a bucket,

331
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:47,930
let's say,

332
00:41:48,290 --> 00:42:01,100
and the rate in which an air molecule comes into contact with the beam alkyl creating a product of C and D molecules is the law of mass action.

333
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:09,140
And so the way in which we model transmission and the way in which even the most complicated.

334
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:14,440
Uh, micro simulation model that's modeling Seattle.

335
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:24,879
The way they're modeling transmission is assuming that people are moving within an area,

336
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:29,410
let's say this room, randomly and randomly interacting with people.

337
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:38,110
And so the probability that an infectious person comes into an effective we call it effective contacts of a susceptible affective

338
00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:47,200
meaning there's actually a transmission event is proportional to the product of the number of people susceptible times,

339
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:53,980
the number of infected. And so that's that's what we mean by a lot of mass action.

340
00:42:54,970 --> 00:43:09,790
And this is. Basically this symbol is model, and it was a model that was developed even before McKendrick by Sir Ronald Ross and Hamer.

341
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:22,610
And the idea here is. We want to predict the number of cases sees the number of cases in some future time.

342
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:29,510
And that's we assume it's equal to the number of cases, times the number of susceptibles.

343
00:43:30,410 --> 00:43:39,200
At the current time, t times is transmission rate is the rate of generating new cases.

344
00:43:40,730 --> 00:43:46,000
So. This dynamic equation is basically saying if we know.

345
00:43:47,490 --> 00:43:53,910
What's happening in the present. We can predict what's happening in the future based on this law of mass action.

346
00:43:54,810 --> 00:43:58,260
So it's the product of a number of cases, times of receptacles.

347
00:43:59,310 --> 00:44:06,930
And so. And it's this product that creates this nonlinear feature of transmission systems.

348
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:11,620
It's what creates this explosive outbreak that we see.

349
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:21,630
We see we've seen this in Kobe. You know, we've got lots of cases and transmission events occurring at a very low level.

350
00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:25,919
And it's something that could be occurring for a month or so.

351
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:33,290
And then once it gets up to about a certain amount, there's just explosive increase in cases.

352
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:37,140
And we've seen this wave after wave in the COVID pandemic.

353
00:44:38,370 --> 00:44:44,280
And it also results in this interdependency of so that.

354
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:52,560
The risk that a susceptible person becomes a case is not just dependent on its.

355
00:44:54,640 --> 00:45:01,420
Risk factors. But it actually depended on the the number of cases in the population.

356
00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:05,410
So that in epidemiology,

357
00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:10,750
the whole sort of risk factor paradigm that you're learning in epidemiology assumes

358
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:16,030
that the risk of Person A is completely independent of the risk of person B,

359
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:18,610
and you have to make that assumption.

360
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:27,160
So that year your calculation of odds ratios and relative risks makes sense that there's an assumption of independence.

361
00:45:28,270 --> 00:45:35,120
But here in this model, we are codifying this as an interdependent factor process.

362
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:47,320
So this multiplication is like the keystone of the whole of transmission modeling and in all of its nonlinear features.

363
00:45:50,290 --> 00:45:54,310
So this is kind of goes into how we calculate.

364
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:59,540
And implement this model. So.

365
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:05,560
We look at. Okay, we want to predict the number of cases, number of susceptibles in the future time.

366
00:46:06,610 --> 00:46:13,530
What's the number of susceptibles in the current time minus how many susceptibles we're predicting we're going to lose?

367
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:19,200
Because all of these this is the number that will turn into cases.

368
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:23,439
So Susceptibles we'll lose our times.

369
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:28,930
Q Times S B and those will all become cases.

370
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:36,640
And then the cases in the prior times that are all assumed to recover.

371
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:45,700
And so we add that to the recovered state. The recovered state is an explicitly model here.

372
00:46:46,690 --> 00:46:51,340
But it's everybody that's recovered and they're assumed to be immune.

373
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:55,950
Um, and have this conferred immunity to future infections.

374
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:06,209
So this so the question is what what are the some of the assumptions that go into this

375
00:47:06,210 --> 00:47:12,540
very simple model is that very simple model but have been incredibly useful throughout.

376
00:47:13,610 --> 00:47:18,799
You know, starting in 1905 to predict, to a large extent,

377
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:24,650
measles was the one disease system that was modeled the most and in the early part of the century.

378
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:30,230
And so first assumption is assumption of homogeneity.

379
00:47:31,970 --> 00:47:36,290
We assume that everybody has equal susceptibility to infection.

380
00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:44,990
Everybody has an equal capacity to transmit. Again, we know that's not true, but it's an assumption in this model.

381
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:57,800
And to the extent that we want to break down this assumption and build in heterogeneity would really depend on the research question we're asking,

382
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:04,639
and that's what would drive us to get more complicated. In this model, the times equals the incubation period.

383
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:11,490
That is, you become a case immediately after that one time step.

384
00:48:11,570 --> 00:48:17,430
So this. This unit plus one, whatever time unit that is.

385
00:48:17,450 --> 00:48:26,509
It could be a week. It could be a day. That's that's the assumption that is going to be the incubation period.

386
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:30,590
So in the measles epidemic that you'll be looking at in lab one,

387
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:41,900
we assume that one times that for seven days in our model that we have the infectious period in this case is short compared to the incubation period.

388
00:48:42,290 --> 00:48:48,320
So the moment there's a contact, there's a transmission event that occurs.

389
00:48:51,030 --> 00:49:03,440
And then all the cases recover after one time. So again, all of these assumptions are always going to be actually false.

390
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:12,240
But the question of whether or not you want to relax these assumptions is pretty much what we're going to be covering throughout the semester.

391
00:49:12,390 --> 00:49:15,410
We're going to relax these assumptions in different ways.

392
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:18,780
We're going to build in waterborne transmission.

393
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:26,550
We're going to and we're going to assume that there is no immunity, there's temporary immunity, and we're going to build in heterogeneity.

394
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:30,810
And there might be high risk groups and low risk groups.

395
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:38,670
But the point of the beginning of this class is to show you how useful even this simple model can be.

396
00:49:43,950 --> 00:49:49,110
So again, these additional assumptions individuals have fixed probability of contacting others.

397
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:56,190
We know that not to be true. And so, you know, there superspreaders superspreading events that occur.

398
00:49:56,220 --> 00:50:02,400
People that are going to be in contact with a lot more people, food handlers is a good example of that.

399
00:50:02,910 --> 00:50:05,250
Infection spreads directly from cases that doubles.

400
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:14,970
Again, we know that that is really only true in a sexually transmitted disease, certainly not true in a vector borne disease or a waterborne disease.

401
00:50:16,950 --> 00:50:24,300
But again, it depends on what your research question is as to as to which of the assumptions you might want to relax.

402
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:31,280
What are the two big features of this transmission model?

403
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:36,150
So what's the potential of the beginning, middle and end of an outbreak? I think one.

404
00:50:36,170 --> 00:50:48,170
So one aspect of this multiplication is that when you start with 1000 people and only one person is susceptible, the product is a thousand.

405
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:57,020
When there's 500, susceptible is 500 and in fact is infectious people.

406
00:50:57,140 --> 00:51:07,340
The product is 25,000. And then when you go back and on the back end, when you only have one susceptible a thousand cases, you're back to 2000.

407
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:17,180
So just by thinking about this product, you can kind of get a sense of why you have this explosive outbreak, because as the number of cases increases,

408
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:25,970
that then you get this geometric increase and they're basically an exponential increase that causes

409
00:51:25,970 --> 00:51:32,900
this explosive outbreak that we see we've seen in Kobe and we see in measles and all sorts of.

410
00:51:36,410 --> 00:51:46,780
Infectious disease processes. And then this kind of leads into why we are even interested in the Reed Rice model.

411
00:51:49,490 --> 00:51:56,590
This model. Right here has a potential for predicting more cases at plus one.

412
00:51:56,590 --> 00:51:59,730
They are susceptibles, which obviously doesn't make sense. Right?

413
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:06,460
So if you got three cases, got one susceptible and R happens to be one,

414
00:52:06,850 --> 00:52:13,960
you're going to predict that you're going to have three cases in the future, new cases, but you only had one susceptible to start with.

415
00:52:14,050 --> 00:52:21,820
So at some point the mass action model breaks down and in the next few slides I'll just show you that

416
00:52:23,050 --> 00:52:33,310
that realistically doesn't happen very often because that R parameter is actually often usually very,

417
00:52:33,310 --> 00:52:37,110
very small. So.

418
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:54,510
So this is kind of building and this is the re France model is a focus of the lab on Wednesday and here's an introduction to this model.

419
00:52:54,510 --> 00:53:02,010
So read on for us about this model in the fifties with an understanding of the limitations of the mass action model.

420
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:06,600
And so it's based on the premise that the contact between a given susceptible.

421
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:15,550
In case. And one or more cases, Ari will produce only one new case.

422
00:53:16,990 --> 00:53:20,140
So would they want to build in this assumption that you couldn't get.

423
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:28,170
More cases in the future than you had susceptibles. And so here's the derivation of the model.

424
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:35,490
We start with P, which is the probability of a contact resulting in a transmission effect event.

425
00:53:35,490 --> 00:53:44,220
So we call that an effective contact. You know, you get a transmission event where one person casts on another person, for example.

426
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:56,070
And if that's the case, then. Q If it's one minus B is the probability of a contact not resulting in a transmission event, it's the inverse.

427
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:04,350
And then if you have. CTE cases circulating in a population.

428
00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:12,349
Q To the power is the probability of an individual not coming into contact with any of the cases.

429
00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:16,280
So if you had two cases, that would be Q squared, three cases.

430
00:54:16,310 --> 00:54:26,850
Q to the third, which would be against the probability that you'd come into you don't come into contact with any of those and.

431
00:54:27,930 --> 00:54:34,299
Cases. And then one might ask you to to see them become is the probability of an individual coming

432
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:41,640
into contact with one or more just the inverse of the key did see so here this probability.

433
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:48,350
Which builds in this assumption that we want.

434
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:52,820
That was the premise of the repriced model. And so.

435
00:54:55,130 --> 00:55:02,750
Now instead of. The mass action model would have S-T multiplied by our times.

436
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:08,000
C t Now we have one minus Q to the C power.

437
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:15,590
And so that seat. So the number of new cases given is susceptibles.

438
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:20,680
And the key thing here is that this. Term is always less than one.

439
00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:28,650
So that term is always less than one. You never predict more cases than you have susceptibles.

440
00:55:30,810 --> 00:55:34,080
So that's the beauty and the elegance of this model.

441
00:55:37,090 --> 00:55:43,810
Was it how it was to deal with this limitation of the mass action model?

442
00:55:46,630 --> 00:55:55,450
So one last thing that is to see, okay, what happens when that probability of contact resulting in transmission event is actually small,

443
00:55:56,170 --> 00:56:05,350
which when we look at the actual values in class, we'll see that our our our ratings are actually are are very small.

444
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:14,470
So the question is, if what happens when he is very small, which is Q is just one minus P?

445
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:17,710
So what happens here when P is small?

446
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:29,620
It turns out that one minus P to the CD power when P is small, is approximately equal to C, T times P, that's just a mathematical property.

447
00:56:30,310 --> 00:56:44,290
And, and if you simplify it is you get P times 20 times c t so we see that when P is small.

448
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:52,410
P basically is the same as the transmission rate grammar that we had in our mass action model.

449
00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:57,150
So they read for us model simplifies the mass action. Model 20 is small.

450
00:57:00,490 --> 00:57:05,930
So. And that.

451
00:57:07,370 --> 00:57:15,390
Is. Why? Most of the models that we'll see in the literature and you'll be exploring some of these models in the literature.

452
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:22,470
And when you do the general review and also the project, they stick with the mass action model.

453
00:57:22,710 --> 00:57:26,550
Some people still use the repriced model and now it's not nearly as prevalent.

454
00:57:31,110 --> 00:57:37,680
So I think that's it. Yeah. So that's it on the mass action model.

455
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:53,520
I think there is one added. Yeah. One thing I wanted to go over before we have a discussion about some of these questions is any questions on this?

456
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:59,069
Yeah. So the assumption that the mass action model is that those that have recovered from

457
00:57:59,070 --> 00:58:05,940
the disease can not become just something great if you have that is actually not.

458
00:58:06,810 --> 00:58:11,370
That's an assumption of this very simple mass action model.

459
00:58:17,510 --> 00:58:26,149
But as we'll see, we'll relax that assumption and still so we can still use this mass action assumption

460
00:58:26,150 --> 00:58:34,610
and transmission but relax the assumption that that people have long term immunity.

461
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:48,590
So the so these assumptions are the assumption of this model, not necessarily assumptions of mass action or say that make sense.

462
00:58:49,910 --> 00:59:02,270
You know, you clarify what you mean by that. So in, you know, I could come up with a model that says that the number of susceptibles I could,

463
00:59:02,270 --> 00:59:10,700
I could add another term here then that adds some of these people into this set of all at a certain rate.

464
00:59:11,150 --> 00:59:19,520
So maybe and the rates low enough. So it's like on average, people are immune for a year and then they become central again.

465
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:26,600
So but I still have this mass action term, you know, still a mass action model with respect to transmission.

466
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:31,370
But I've made the model more complicated, so I don't assume long term immunity.

467
00:59:31,670 --> 00:59:38,900
So, yes, that's a good point. So this the assumptions that I mentioned here, all of these assumptions.

468
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:45,150
Our assumption on this particular model, but not about mass action.

469
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:54,329
There are some assumptions we'll talk about with respect to kind of mass action that we're going to deal with when we deal with waterborne pathogens,

470
00:59:54,330 --> 01:00:00,960
for instance. But where we're actually assuming that it's not.

471
01:00:01,370 --> 01:00:05,940
Again, it's not a contact between SFO and infectious.

472
01:00:06,450 --> 01:00:09,720
It's that person is contacting the environment.

473
01:00:09,750 --> 01:00:17,760
So as an infectious person contaminates the environment and that pathogen can stay around for months.

474
01:00:18,510 --> 01:00:24,830
And anybody who comes within a month and gets exposed to that pathogen is going to be transmit.

475
01:00:24,870 --> 01:00:32,909
And that you could never predict from a simple mass action model because simple mass action

476
01:00:32,910 --> 01:00:36,930
model says you've got this contact and then you got this immediate transmission event.

477
01:00:37,530 --> 01:00:43,190
But for a lot of pathogens, like vector borne and indirectly transmitted pathogens, that doesn't occur.

478
01:00:43,420 --> 01:00:48,760
And it can. And the questions.

479
01:00:52,580 --> 01:00:56,400
Okay. So. Switching gears a little bit.

480
01:00:58,040 --> 01:01:05,040
For people. This is this. This is a slide that you can have access to.

481
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:14,700
You have access to from. To orient yourself or to the second part of the lab you are working on right now.

482
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:21,720
Just wanted to go over this and see if there's any questions.

483
01:01:21,730 --> 01:01:27,910
So the idea is that. We're using this exponential model.

484
01:01:29,070 --> 01:01:34,379
To model population growth. And so the idea of this model.

485
01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:42,150
Right, is. That population just kind of grow exponentially.

486
01:01:44,340 --> 01:01:51,990
And what this lab is doing is saying, okay, that's actually doesn't work that well.

487
01:01:52,590 --> 01:02:06,630
And if you want to look at the lifespan of human population growth, but actually if you think about different time segments in the population,

488
01:02:07,660 --> 01:02:13,360
I think we have seven of them in this in the dataset, they're different.

489
01:02:13,740 --> 01:02:19,440
There's population exponential growth until something happens dramatically in the advent of agriculture,

490
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:26,490
for instance, which actually increases the capacity of the population.

491
01:02:26,790 --> 01:02:33,210
And so that every year each timestamp there's a different and a different R.

492
01:02:34,230 --> 01:02:48,600
So you got this what we call piecewise exponential order. So then during this time that you have a very small R and it increases basically as

493
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:56,430
we get we develop different technologies to increase the capacity of the population.

494
01:02:58,950 --> 01:03:09,630
So and these are the different. This is the data that you are down you download from the campus site and basically

495
01:03:09,650 --> 01:03:20,080
assumption group -297,000 years sorry population two and in 1984 4.4 million.

496
01:03:20,470 --> 01:03:32,500
And it turns out that if you just didn't create had an exponential model Y with one growth constant, you'd never predict 4.4 million.

497
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:44,260
But um, each are assuming that there's a different growth constant and every time period, uh, allows you to fit the data much better.

498
01:03:44,830 --> 01:03:55,870
So this exponential model, which people have critiqued, you know, for a long time, and that museum growth model has shown that if you,

499
01:03:55,870 --> 01:04:04,659
you can think about exponential growth in smaller time steps, that actually does well and predicting population growth.

500
01:04:04,660 --> 01:04:14,290
So that's the point is that the paper that went over this analysis and so what you're

501
01:04:14,290 --> 01:04:23,590
doing is trying to estimate what the growth rate is at each time period in the lab and.

502
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:33,900
This is actually kind of like the recipe for how we estimate the growth constant.

503
01:04:34,290 --> 01:04:37,360
So we start. With this equation.

504
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:47,850
We take the log of both sides. And this is one of the rules of logarithms, the product rule,

505
01:04:47,860 --> 01:04:57,600
that basically the log of the product is actually equal for the log and each of the terms, the sum of each of the terms.

506
01:05:00,330 --> 01:05:12,389
And basically, you can do a little more algebra here and you you log of an exponent results in canceling out the log.

507
01:05:12,390 --> 01:05:24,770
So you wind up with. This term so far is basically the response is basically the log of the population that at the end of the

508
01:05:24,770 --> 01:05:32,240
timeframe and of any time or time period minus the log at the beginning of the time period divided by the time.

509
01:05:34,710 --> 01:05:41,370
So and then. So then the real question is how do you actually calculate this and that?

510
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:56,840
Task five of the lab. The first part of the lab goes out and describes how you actually calculate the differences of successive.

511
01:05:57,340 --> 01:06:05,919
So basically to get the difference between the end and beginning of each times that if we have these

512
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:12,640
eight population values is just the log of population two minus log of population one and onwards.

513
01:06:13,090 --> 01:06:19,120
Same with the time that we can get the difference at a successive time.

514
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:23,650
T to my t1t3 times t to here.

515
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:28,700
And then if we just take. The difference.

516
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:42,290
The log of log P and we divide and we do this dot divide and divide it by the difference in t we basically

517
01:06:42,290 --> 01:06:51,320
will get you'll get in a vector the growth constants for each of these time frame each of these time periods.

518
01:06:52,790 --> 01:07:03,260
One key thing that you know and that's what you went over in the first part of the lab is if you do a dot divide, it's an element by element divide.

519
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:08,030
If you don't do a device divide, it's a matrix division which we'll never be doing in this course.

520
01:07:08,030 --> 01:07:13,400
And you get either you get an error or you get a very complicated result.

521
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:21,470
So you want to be clear, most are almost always you're going to be doing dot multiplier, dot dividing in this course.

522
01:07:24,620 --> 01:07:33,710
So this is basically giving you an idea. I mean, if you if you think through task five, part one, also in the context of this,

523
01:07:35,150 --> 01:07:43,940
you'll be able to get to the estimates of all the rate growth constants for each of the period time periods.

524
01:07:49,820 --> 01:07:57,810
Does that make any questions on that? Has anybody gotten to this?

525
01:07:58,540 --> 01:08:01,560
It was made it to this section.

526
01:08:01,950 --> 01:08:07,540
Okay. So be good to get again.

527
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:13,440
I think some of you need to come in late by day for these first two labs.

528
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:18,630
You'll have two weeks to do each of the labs to do the right up to the labs.

529
01:08:18,990 --> 01:08:26,700
So we're going to actually focus on that first, then the next lab on Wednesday.

530
01:08:27,810 --> 01:08:41,970
But, you know, the due dates for each lab is basically two weeks after the date it was you started the lab and that way because an hour on MLK week,

531
01:08:42,570 --> 01:08:46,410
the following week where you have Monday off,

532
01:08:46,410 --> 01:08:55,140
we're going to do a we'll have a lecture discussion on Wednesday and not have a lab and a question about the next question.

533
01:08:55,170 --> 01:09:00,320
Do you have a preference in terms of the format? You want us to send Nicole?

534
01:09:00,790 --> 01:09:03,869
Copy, paste, work done? Yeah, it's a good question.

535
01:09:03,870 --> 01:09:13,770
So I'd like that. See, you could either use you can use your the lab worksheet but in a, in a word document just provide.

536
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:22,540
It's always better to show your work and but just provide the actual code.

537
01:09:23,140 --> 01:09:25,990
You don't have to show all the mistakes you made or, you know,

538
01:09:26,290 --> 01:09:33,400
just just copy and paste into a word document the code that or the steps you took to get the answer.

539
01:09:35,980 --> 01:09:42,670
And so is this back to this week? Because often this business that's been lost.

540
01:09:45,910 --> 01:09:51,810
So that might be maybe a new day. I mean, look at the ISO.

541
01:09:51,820 --> 01:09:57,190
Know it to be do so lab. This lab you're working on, lab zero is due January 18.

542
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:01,710
And then the next lab will be due January 25th. So we'll fix that.

543
01:10:02,790 --> 01:10:16,110
Thanks. Did you groups today save those documents?

544
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:21,320
Yeah, we only had 10 minutes, and maybe we could just do a quick. Let's see where.

545
01:10:29,700 --> 01:10:33,990
Can you see the video? Can you see your quick response? Yes, you can.

546
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:41,640
Yes. Okay. So the way campus is set up. You guys just won't be able to see the answers until I release the participation points.

547
01:10:42,150 --> 01:10:48,150
So why is it that way? Yeah.

548
01:10:48,220 --> 01:10:50,970
So easier. Because I have the videos.

549
01:10:50,970 --> 01:11:02,970
I'll spend some of the time during this lecture period in discussion, and I have these three discussion questions.

550
01:11:04,350 --> 01:11:19,920
And maybe we'll just spend a few. Maybe for now we're going to maybe just a three, three, maybe games that could be in groups of three.

551
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:31,409
And again, and maybe just discuss these three questions in there in like 5 minutes and maybe just even your next two.

552
01:11:31,410 --> 01:11:43,890
So let's see if they go there and they make their use three and then three and then maybe the last group can be four.

553
01:11:47,380 --> 01:11:51,300
Yeah, I know. How did you.

554
01:11:51,790 --> 01:11:55,630
Yeah, I just did what we did last semester. How good I may.

555
01:11:55,660 --> 01:12:00,170
Maybe if you kind of look at the names for each shooter.

556
01:12:02,590 --> 01:12:10,210
So the. So I agree has made in the home page groups.

557
01:12:10,540 --> 01:12:17,919
One, two, three, four. So one, two. So maybe so this would be group one, two, three.

558
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:19,960
And then for if you could just.

559
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:30,730
And so it'll be it's a word document where maybe somebody could type in some of the sentence, some of these types in your what you've been discussing.

560
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:41,800
And also you can type in your names there, too. Mm hmm. And I think some students, although you said select zero student 18 one of these.

561
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:52,210
Okay. And they were like, well, let's talk about those. So today I was just like, Yeah, you've been able to remember.

562
01:12:52,690 --> 01:12:56,590
Oh, they were okay. Like, you know. Right.

563
01:12:58,270 --> 01:13:01,299
Like, make sure they can all be in there for some reason.

564
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:04,300
We can just read. Wasn't published by any publisher in writing.

565
01:13:04,510 --> 01:13:09,999
Yeah. Oh, you mean, like, kind of. Yeah. Like a whole can be used where?

566
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,030
Julianna emailed me over the weekend and said she was driving.

567
01:13:13,670 --> 01:13:20,510
Okay, I guess based on what we'd have seen when we looked at what kind of the transcripts yesterday morning,

568
01:13:20,650 --> 01:13:28,870
um, Johanna said that she had just finished the campus speech over this weekend, so I think she was behind.

569
01:13:28,870 --> 01:13:35,079
It sounds like I could quickly add week two and three and they were published by.

570
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:43,740
But you can just kind of go through all of them and it always seems to be going, okay, so we can start discussion next.

571
01:13:43,750 --> 01:13:48,760
I think you did another class and research different.

572
01:13:48,910 --> 01:13:56,290
Um we do they if views on terrorism that we'll start next week we may not be able to add

573
01:13:56,290 --> 01:14:00,720
as much right well it doesn't sound like anybody would why should is there anything.

574
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:05,570
So I was able to watch for. How can you guys?

575
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:11,150
I don't know. It looks like everything's accomplished now.

576
01:14:11,420 --> 01:14:15,170
Well, I probably saw that one way, which I should it. But you had access?

577
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:19,780
Yeah. I mean, you guys had access. Okay, well done.

578
01:14:24,390 --> 01:14:32,300
Well, I'm. Yeah, that's weird.

579
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:41,080
I emailed you guys this week, but I haven't yet.

580
01:14:45,130 --> 01:14:48,980
Talked. And this is.

581
01:14:49,750 --> 01:14:53,149
Yeah, but I think I have all the data.

582
01:14:53,150 --> 01:14:58,070
I think I'm going to need all the data, and I think I have most of the code already.

583
01:14:58,490 --> 01:15:03,260
So I think it's hard to separate the. Yeah.

584
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:07,610
I just don't want to go into that. Yeah. This is.

585
01:15:09,050 --> 01:15:18,140
Why did you read the article? That was just a process where.

586
01:15:30,270 --> 01:15:35,470
You should go see.

587
01:15:42,420 --> 01:15:52,370
And he was interested in the whole area, which is, you know, something that is offensive in a way.

588
01:15:53,560 --> 01:16:09,810
Yeah. And the reason for that is that whenever you have the same process and everything around you and everything that that client was.

589
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:27,630
For someone like you. And also if you're anything like I had, you know, about at least beginning this morning.

590
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:33,030
Yeah. You want me to reach out to her about this? She said that you were taking notes either.

591
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:36,860
Yeah. So maybe I'll drop a little tweets with her. And just.

592
01:16:36,870 --> 01:16:42,330
My guess is I don't know what she's going to drop, but I want her to remember to do it right.

593
01:16:42,950 --> 01:16:52,640
Period. So I should have been describing the other ones this man is concerned about.

594
01:16:54,180 --> 01:17:03,570
Yes. I'm sorry. That was when this was when we met at work.

595
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:17,540
I think it was like 78 hours of sexual assault.

596
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:38,190
Episode of respect for those who are not supposed to be here.

597
01:17:38,680 --> 01:17:47,190
I'm so sorry. Right.

598
01:17:47,860 --> 01:17:51,800
And know I have another class right before this at all times.

599
01:17:51,810 --> 01:18:02,520
Right after this. Okay. And so that's everything else until there is going of change over the next year.

600
01:18:04,390 --> 01:18:10,270
It's like 30 or 60 or 70 or 17.

601
01:18:10,980 --> 01:18:19,590
So yeah, so it looks like a couple of days left and everyone else is smoking a cigaret here more or less.

602
01:18:20,010 --> 01:18:26,580
Yes. You don't want to feel part of the future.

603
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:33,040
Oh yeah. I have a problem. I can't do it right now.

604
01:18:33,290 --> 01:18:38,100
It's like 33 year old just talking about it greatly.

605
01:18:38,970 --> 01:18:44,610
So I knew I have to look after myself. That is specifically very fact.

606
01:18:46,470 --> 01:18:56,870
Yes. Which is something I think is sort of different than if you're telling me the truth.

607
01:18:58,710 --> 01:19:04,620
Okay. Just then, I'll ask you to imagine a weekend here, like when you guys came up, like for the first question.

608
01:19:06,210 --> 01:19:11,260
We just think back to work. I would just pick one question to say this.

609
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:16,650
And we got a second question. Okay, let's go back.

610
01:19:19,620 --> 01:19:22,940
It's not. Okay. So. Okay.

611
01:19:23,250 --> 01:19:35,250
Okay. So we so we kind of started out by just going right to some of these classes and then we kind of focus that these diseases that

612
01:19:35,250 --> 01:19:40,840
there might have been some sort of external factors that we kind of look at things like an accidental result of pregnancy.

613
01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:44,880
And so you've got to have some sort of gestational diabetes or postpartum depression

614
01:19:45,330 --> 01:19:52,750
where you are susceptible to pregnant and then you get gestational diabetes with that.

615
01:19:53,070 --> 01:19:56,670
But that resolves itself after the fact.
