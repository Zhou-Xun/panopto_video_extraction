1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:05,540
I think I read one place you said I'm crystal.

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:09,890
I see her pronouns. I currently work for the School of Information just down the road.

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,640
I worked here for five years. That's how I got involved with this program.

4
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:21,800
We decided it made sense that I still talk about rosaries because I still work with data scientists and so like, Hello, I know that field.

5
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:28,940
I also really like this presentation. Resumes are my favorite part of my job and so I get excited about it.

6
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:32,600
I know that you all may not be as excited about it, but that's okay.

7
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:38,810
I also realize that I am the thing between you and life, which is a terrible place is a divide.

8
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:43,820
And so just a few norms that I like to set up with you that I'm going to bring my solar energy.

9
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:49,489
I ask that you bring your full attention right now you're like full energy, and that's okay if you don't bring that.

10
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:52,129
But if we ask questions, I'm looking for answers.

11
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:58,490
You know, you can just tell them how you can raise your hand if you feel like you want to write it down handed out, that's fine.

12
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:04,910
I don't care. But I think that resumes is one of those things that's only valuable if you invest yourself in it.

13
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:08,030
Like, I can't tell you how to do things about your experience.

14
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:12,410
It's only you were the expert in that. And so that's just the norm that I'm expecting.

15
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:18,230
Also, I know that we are all human beings. If you need to get up, go to the bathroom, stand up, do some jumping.

16
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:23,240
I don't care. I'm just trying not to do it like in this space because that gets in the way.

17
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:28,370
So we have aisles, we got to go back, we got to outside all of that.

18
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:33,089
I'm also trying to use your technology. I know that most of us have our recipes, our computers.

19
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:38,930
That's cool. If you don't have your resume pulled up on your computer or people might be available.

20
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:42,020
I would request that because we are going to have some of your work.

21
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:46,190
In fact, I already see a question. Yes. Do you want to use resumes, CVS or.

22
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:51,709
It doesn't matter. I will be focusing on resumes and I will explain that in just a minute and why I'm going to do that.

23
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:55,210
But I feel like this information is applicable for the minority group.

24
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:59,360
Excellent question. Any other questions before we get started?

25
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:04,330
Yeah. Are you going to explain the difference between a resume incident?

26
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:12,850
Yes, I have. It's literally. It's like that that. So I welcome questions throughout loss and take some cause breaks.

27
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,980
So here we go. So just a little bit of how this is going to be broken up.

28
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:22,059
We're going to start with the formatting because often the formatting is the biggest barrier

29
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:27,490
between you and getting a job because it's not readable by whatever computer system you put it in.

30
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,900
So we'll talk about some standard expectations for that and what it might look like.

31
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:39,069
Well, then talk about customizing your content, writing bullets, and then what a final stack might look like as a part of the final check.

32
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:42,490
We'll also talk about how to collect big data, sometimes too high risk.

33
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:52,060
All right. So first question. Answering it nailed it. The difference between a resumé and a CV can feel really small.

34
00:02:52,720 --> 00:03:00,250
In the U.S., it is pretty big, though. So just as context, if you're applying for jobs outside of the United States, CV and resume are the same thing.

35
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:07,020
It's only in the U.S. that they're different. So in the U.S., a resume is considered a summary of your skills.

36
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:11,139
It's typically only one page and it's just like a snapshot.

37
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:15,430
So it's not everything you've ever done in your life as opposed to a CV.

38
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:19,450
This is something that's academically focused typically on the fields of research,

39
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:23,170
teaching and institutional service, and it can be as long as you want.

40
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,829
So it includes like an extensive presentation and publications list.

41
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:32,830
It has a lot of classes on it. It might have any teaching stuff that you've done or volunteering or, you know,

42
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:40,239
really everything that you have professionally done that would carry you for a career in academia that goes on a CV as opposed to a resume,

43
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:44,140
which is more about the skills that you've gained from the experiences that you've had.

44
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:49,270
So I'm going to take a break. Also run out of breath every time I do this presentation.

45
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:55,260
Does that answer the question, not CV or resume? Any lingering thoughts?

46
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:02,380
One question I commonly get about this issue is if it sounds both, which do I turn?

47
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:09,840
And so if it says both and you're applying for a job in academia and you truly do have the option of both,

48
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:15,920
if it's not inside academia, they probably mean resume and they just think they're being fancy by writing curriculum vitae.

49
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,230
So turn in a resume. All right.

50
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:25,990
So from the perspective of this presentation, I'm going to be primarily focusing on her resume.

51
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:32,320
The reason for that is because CV has changed drastically by institution and type of program.

52
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:36,790
And so if you're looking to apply to somewhere that has a CV requirement,

53
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:45,220
I would encourage you to find a faculty member or someone else in that specific area of study at that place that you can model your CV after,

54
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:50,890
because there's just too many expectations for that as opposed to a resume, which I can give you some specific things.

55
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:58,360
And so on a resume, what an employer is looking for is an achievement highlights reel of your achievements.

56
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:02,350
So this includes things like your professional experience, volunteering,

57
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:09,790
student or academic training and really anything that has built your skills to do the job that you're looking for.

58
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:15,970
This typically does not include marital status, age, race, gender, religion and other protected categories.

59
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:20,409
And the reason that I say that is because, again, if you're applying for a job that's not in the United States,

60
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:26,319
I would encourage you to use resources like going global or interstate or whatever else resources

61
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:31,060
your home institution has to help you include guidelines that might be included elsewhere.

62
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:35,889
A great example of this would be my sister when she was applying for a job in

63
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:39,700
South Africa and it was required that she lost her marital status on her resume.

64
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:44,600
It's just north somewhere else. And so she wanted we want to make sure that we're fulfilling that.

65
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:48,680
But in the U.S., it invites bias in a typical way.

66
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:54,230
And so we would encourage you to not put that on there anywhere, because it can automatically be due out in some cases.

67
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:59,120
So on that note, a note about bias. Yes. Liz. Yeah.

68
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,469
What about like the things you're talking about in your resume?

69
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:07,370
It include some things that might indicate like we're going to talk about that in the next slide.

70
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,240
That's a great question.

71
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:15,079
So the question was just for the recording, what happens if something that you've done in the past does indicate some protected category?

72
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:22,309
So that is a great question. So I don't know if bias is the research that there is bias on resumes.

73
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:25,880
I hope you all know that you just came out of a microaggressions presentation.

74
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:30,350
There is bias in all parts of the way the United States operates.

75
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,220
I like to put that out there because I don't want you to get caught off guard.

76
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:41,210
And the reason that I also bring it up is because there are ways and choices that you can make about how to address this.

77
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,430
There's one route, an extreme,

78
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:50,389
that is you put everything about yourself and let them weed you out because you know you wouldn't be welcome there as the approach I personally take.

79
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:54,020
Like, let me tell you all of my identities and if you don't want them, then I don't want to work here.

80
00:06:54,680 --> 00:07:01,420
And the other route is to like to create like a summary that removes some of those identities.

81
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:08,629
So for example, if I didn't want someone to know that I was in the women in House leadership, I helped that organization here.

82
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:13,610
I might just say health leadership, student organization, as opposed to women in health leadership,

83
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:18,350
because something to know about a resume is it's not considered a legal document.

84
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,450
So you don't have to put your legal name.

85
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:28,610
You don't have to like name every specific part of a student org as long as it's accurately reflecting the general essence of what you have.

86
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,150
That includes things like our address. We'll talk later.

87
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,500
The only thing that I would encourage you to make sure is really true is your contact information,

88
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:41,150
because it's often how they're going to tell you that you have an interview and you want that information to be correct.

89
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:46,820
And so we're not like, I never encourage someone to do something that they are not comfortable with.

90
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:51,650
So if you want to hide part of your identity, go for it. If you want to put it out there, go for it.

91
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:58,190
If you don't know yet, I would encourage you to talk to a career counselor to help make that decision so that you can move forward in a

92
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:03,880
way that accurately represents the person that you want to be in the workforce and who that comfortable person is.

93
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:08,930
Does that make sense? Well, I appreciate the nods.

94
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:13,370
All right. So we're now going to move on to the formatting part.

95
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:16,510
Yes, Gustavo, we'll start on this table.

96
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:19,610
Sorry, I have a question about bias and prejudice.

97
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:24,350
Rossini never put a picture on your resume. That's an easy one.

98
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:30,290
Is this another question? And it's a stretch. All right, we like stretching.

99
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:39,020
Okay, so when we're organizing our rows, make something that I want to be very clear with you about is we we're going to spend some time on this.

100
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,330
The average amount of time that someone puts into their master copy of their resume is about 3 hours.

101
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:51,650
This is unfortunate because the majority of time, if you get to a human meeting, they're going to look at your resume for maybe 30 to 60 seconds.

102
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:55,850
So you're not a huge return on investment, but it could lead to a job.

103
00:08:56,390 --> 00:09:04,040
And so that's why we're going to talk about formatting first, is because we want to organize it in a logical, approachable way so that in 30 seconds,

104
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:12,020
can someone get the information about your ability to do the job and have the skills that they're looking for before they move on?

105
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:18,080
And so we want to make it really easy to say, yes, that's something that I want to keep you to keep in mind as we're approaching resumes,

106
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:22,070
make it easy for them to say, yes, you're qualified. Let's move on to this reading round.

107
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:28,640
So formatting is my favorite slide I've ever made, not templates.

108
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:31,129
You all see The Incredibles at the moment,

109
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:38,840
fashion designer extraordinaire has a rule about superheroes for no capes similar to crystal superpower resumes, no templates.

110
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:46,520
This includes things like InDesign, Figma, Adobe XD really any design software that's not Microsoft Word or Google Docs.

111
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:52,909
I'm going to encourage you not to use that. The reason is, is it's too easy for an applicant tracking system,

112
00:09:52,910 --> 00:10:00,500
which is the online API that's going to take your resume to say no thank you because you can't read the program even if you save it as a PDF,

113
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:09,270
it just can't take it. And so I'm going to recommend that you keep a very standardly formatted document when you turn it the demo.

114
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:18,140
The one exception to this is if you're pursuing more marketing based or design based like user experience, user design UI, let's type of stuff.

115
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,709
You can maybe use a template.

116
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:25,040
I use abstract, higher pitched voice because it's not a best practice.

117
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:31,399
So we encourage just something standard on word, use the features there, try not to use columns, things like that.

118
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:36,440
We can really have like bold italic. Sometimes you can use a table, but not really.

119
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:43,550
You just want to use no templates, make it boring looking. But that means it's a. All right.

120
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:50,290
So here is a study that was done about resumes. I have a resume one which is this one resume, too.

121
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:53,240
Which is this one? This is an eye tracking study.

122
00:10:53,270 --> 00:11:01,270
So what it did was it gave someone to document for 60 seconds and it tracked where their I fell the most.

123
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:04,450
And so the blue is where it touched. The yellow is where it lingers.

124
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:07,490
The red is where it actually probably lingers long enough to read the words.

125
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:14,930
And so what are some observations we have about resumes? What we what kind of information that they you and I can't see your name but hello.

126
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:24,530
And they didn't even care enough to look at the bottom has literally nothing can provide us that's a great

127
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:32,080
observation other observations but it's all focused on the front part of the sentence or like the bullet points.

128
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,390
Excellent. So we saw the front part of the sentence. Alex, did you have your hand up?

129
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:41,180
Yeah. So front part of the sentence that sounds hard to presenting because I can't do my favorite part.

130
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:45,560
What's right here? And I go right over here.

131
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:52,730
What do you all say? I heard someone say it's right that it's not a fair question.

132
00:11:53,660 --> 00:12:01,220
Nothing looks really nothing. Right. So what happened was, is that they spend a lot of time trying to intake this information.

133
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:04,670
They're like spending time up here on the summary.

134
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:08,090
They're spending a little bit of time in the beginning of the bullet points.

135
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:14,090
Words, words are fading quickly. We renew our efforts here right underneath the title, and then we end up here.

136
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:19,940
The reason for this is because there's no whitespace on this. It's not organized in bullet points.

137
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:23,960
It's not organized in a clearly defined way of how can I skim this?

138
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:32,240
And so this is my argument for doing a lot of this. If you'll notice on a resume too, there's a lot more scattering of eye touches.

139
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:39,350
They tend to focus on the different types of experience headers that you have the starting of each of the bullet points similarly.

140
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:42,830
And then there's also this giant focus down on education.

141
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:48,920
I'm going to recommend for all of you, since you're still in school, to put your education at the very top.

142
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:53,240
This is usually the first qualification that's going to get you in the door.

143
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:56,120
Are you a current student or are you recently graduated?

144
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:00,529
And that's going to be what kind of opens that, and then they'll care about the rest of your experience later.

145
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:03,770
But they just want to know that you have the credential to do what they're asking.

146
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,120
So this is science. To prove my point, please use bullet points.

147
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:17,360
All right. And then now we're going to watch the video because I know I talk a lot and I created these three minute videos to cover everything.

148
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,280
I want you to know about structure. Resume.

149
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:33,890
X x x x x x x x x.

150
00:14:20,170 --> 00:15:26,560
X x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x.

151
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:26,470
All right. All right.

152
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,040
So this will be available to you later if you're like, wow, that was a lot of information.

153
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:34,690
I really want to go back to that. I'm going to touch on a few important points about that next.

154
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:42,820
I also we're going to do some of this checklist, stay a part of your resume and in the next section.

155
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:49,030
So just a quick review is that we want to make sure that you have a readable size font.

156
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:55,330
I've seen a lot of resumes in my time as a career counselor that has 9.6 size finds, and that's impossible to reach.

157
00:16:55,750 --> 00:17:01,120
You want to invite the reader to look for the information? Remember, make it easy for them to find what they want.

158
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:08,230
It should be single spaced, but you'll note that there are still spaces in between my different experiences.

159
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:11,049
So that's where we create that break for the eye.

160
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:19,540
To be able to take the information and to give a quick scan, it should be a professional style font that standard loaded onto the computer.

161
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:23,709
And so this really includes any of them that you might turn a class assignment.

162
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:28,030
And it can also include things like gourmands, calligraphy or cleavers.

163
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:36,759
Is standard now really anything that doesn't really use dots or hard to read things of the standard is one inch around,

164
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,100
which I know I'm talking to people that are not going to do that.

165
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:45,549
So please don't make your resumé more than five outside and not margin so on word that's the

166
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:51,580
narrow setting the reason for that is because if you imagine particularly in older places,

167
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:55,780
if you're interviewing with someone who it needs to print out printers don't print

168
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:59,889
outside of point five and then it's going to miss large sections of your paper.

169
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:07,530
And so we always want to play it safe. It should have easy to read headers, consistent formatting and typically is only one page long.

170
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:16,780
So some information about the header is that please include your name that I have seen way too many resumes with no name.

171
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:21,880
This is literally your document for you to be able to say This is who I am, so please tell them who you are.

172
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:27,159
If you go by something that's different than your legal name, remember, this is not a legal document.

173
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:30,790
So you can change it, you can add nicknames, you can add different types of names.

174
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:37,210
It's really whenever you are going to be introducing yourself as in the interview, this is what I recommend writing at the top.

175
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:45,819
It typically includes your phone number and email as the standard and then address is increasingly optional.

176
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:53,440
Thank you, Kelvin. And so the benefit of including your address is particularly if you live close ish.

177
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:56,800
So within the state or the metro region of the place you're applying,

178
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:01,510
there is a bias for hiring managers to say like, oh, they're willing to live here.

179
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:04,540
And so if you're moving cross country,

180
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:11,949
I actually recommend taking your address off and you don't need your full address because no one's going to send you mail.

181
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:18,910
I don't know. The last time that's happened to most people looking for a job, you can just include the city and the state of the place where you live.

182
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:27,730
If you're including things like LinkedIn, GitHub or portfolio, I recommend having a customized link so that it's easy to find it,

183
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:33,309
make sure that it is listed not as a hyperlink on your document because this is too hard for a computer to read.

184
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:38,500
So we recommend just typing it out and then see. All right.

185
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:39,640
Any questions on the head?

186
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:48,370
O other pro tip is don't put this in the actual header of your document because sometimes that can be hidden from the technology that's reading it.

187
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:54,730
So you want to just make sure it's typed out in the regular typing space of your Microsoft Word or Google Docs.

188
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:05,160
So your education is actually this is really important. Remember in my eye tracking system, this is where someone spent the most amount of time.

189
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:08,580
And so you want to make sure first that it's labeled as education.

190
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:15,240
So it's easy to find. You want to list the full name of your institution, not just the acronym.

191
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:23,430
And sometimes they're like, if you went to a place like Michigan or other large institutions, there are colleges and schools inside of that.

192
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:30,540
This is optional for you to add in, so just make sure you're listing it in a way that's standardly recommended by your institution.

193
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:34,859
So sometimes there will be like a dash between the university and the school.

194
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:40,710
Sometimes there's a colon and sometimes there's comma. Just make sure that you're representing it in the same way that the school.

195
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:46,299
And we want to spell out the name of your degree. So Bachelor of Science.

196
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:49,959
Bachelor of Arts, there's a lot of different ones. Typically,

197
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:58,450
you can find this information if you're not quite sure how your degree is titled on your transcript or on the course offerings listed addresses.

198
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:01,780
Yes, when you're home, sedition is not in English.

199
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:05,349
Should we write the name in the original language translators?

200
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:08,890
Or we could write it in just English if you're applying it in English.

201
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:17,210
Yeah, but if you want to, then I would recommend putting that into English translation and then parentheses the non English.

202
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:29,590
That's a great idea but. You'll know that my extra information here includes a certificate, which would be a bullet point.

203
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:33,040
Underneath the degree that it is a part of, it should not be listed separately.

204
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:40,660
And then you'll also note that I have study of Rhodes listed as a bullet point underneath the degree in which they took place.

205
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:45,250
Sometimes study abroad are listed as experiences and that's cool.

206
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:52,330
But if you only want one line as a part of it, it does need to be a bullet, not its own entry, because it didn't result in a degree.

207
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,350
We only put things in the education section that results in a.

208
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:07,100
And then something to note is another way to avoid bias is to say not to just put the end of your degree.

209
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:11,270
No one really cares how long it took you to complete it, as long as you completed it.

210
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:16,250
Shout out to my six years. There's anyone in this room now. You don't have to do it yourself.

211
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:22,880
All right. So education. So some relatives is.

212
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:25,939
There are many jobs out there that may require a GPA.

213
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:32,100
If you're including your GPA, please make sure that it's on a scale and there are places that don't use a 4.0 scale.

214
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,949
There's also places that don't have grades.

215
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:42,650
And so we want to make sure that it's clear what it is that you were assessed on and some safe space in the safe, safe space.

216
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:49,010
Saving tips would be to list your your honors and other things like that as a bullet point underneath your degree.

217
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:55,400
So it could include things like scholarships, any type of awards that you've won in school or recognitions.

218
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:02,780
All right. So you'll notice that there are some consistencies between all of my sections in here.

219
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:08,870
And so your experience section should follow the same type of formatting as your education section.

220
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:15,020
It shouldn't change. And so in your experience section, you want to make sure that you're listing the name of the organization.

221
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:21,799
If we have any international students in this room, please make sure that you're being careful about how you're listing organizations.

222
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:29,450
And if you did or did not have CBT, I would encourage you to talk to places like your local Internet competitor for guidance on that,

223
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:36,349
because there are strict rules about immigration for the ways that you're listing any type of employment in the United States.

224
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:41,360
If you are on CBT or not, you also want to make sure you have a job title.

225
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:46,729
Feel free to be a little bit creative here. It's not a legal document.

226
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:50,959
And so if your title was Intern, that doesn't really tell me much.

227
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:57,590
And so feel free to add some descriptive words that tells me these are the skills that I used or this is what I did.

228
00:23:57,590 --> 00:24:05,750
So maybe like program assessments, analysts, consultants like words that tell me the actual skills that you use that were just in term.

229
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:11,150
This could also include things like student projects where you don't have a title because it was a student project.

230
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:16,969
And so you can make something up that is fairly descriptive of what we can also change that.

231
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:21,740
So once in my past careers, I was a thank you list manager.

232
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:27,889
That doesn't mean anything. So I listed as program manager on my resume for a long time so that people could understand.

233
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:37,160
These were the skills that I gained. Also, in this example, you'll know that I have a way that you can list two different jobs at the same place.

234
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:41,480
So you would list the title of the organization first and then have two different

235
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:46,310
titles and two different date ranges to save you a line on your resume.

236
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:52,700
So this can be really helpful, particularly if you had multiple jobs in your undergrad or at a volunteer opportunity to say,

237
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,610
these are the different things that I did. Yes.

238
00:24:56,180 --> 00:25:05,060
But if you're combining it by location, does it then like would it mess up the chronology of like if I were they were separated by two years.

239
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:13,880
Yeah. So you would go that that's a great question. You go by the experience itself and whatever's on top would be the, the date range that you use.

240
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:17,810
So yeah. So like you count it as a whole section.

241
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:22,040
Okay, so you can like then have something more recent below it.

242
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:28,580
Okay. As long as the first experience in the first entry is newer than the, the second entry.

243
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:39,670
And, and if it's like if you choose to like I guess, do you have to condense it by location if what you want to emphasize is like, oh,

244
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:50,750
so now let's say you're consolidating multiple roles into one thing, but like one of the like roles that you had wasn't for the whole time span.

245
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,980
But okay, each role should have its own time frame.

246
00:25:55,490 --> 00:26:05,060
Okay, so like this one, I have my program assistant job May 2016 to present and then I have I guess our position which was this date range.

247
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:10,820
So each position, if you're consolidating, should have an associated date range with it.

248
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:14,140
I would not put the date rates with the organizations.

249
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:22,290
These are great questions. All right.

250
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,799
This used to be a zoom call. I forgot to take that out. So what is the thing?

251
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:30,030
You should not including your work experience. You're listening in on your rise.

252
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:35,250
I have a company name. Be your title. See your supervisor name and phone number.

253
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:40,620
See the dates and the location. Yes, I think c supervisor.

254
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:45,180
Name and phone number. See? Do other people great. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

255
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:47,640
I'll get like this feedback. Yes, that is correct.

256
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:54,000
The reason that I put this on here is to give you a disclaimer is that if you were applying to a federal job,

257
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,470
which means that you're applying through USA jobs dot gov or is intellect icon,

258
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:05,040
you want to follow a federal resumé guideline and that is completely different than what I am talking about today.

259
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,620
And so I would encourage you to investigate that.

260
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:12,750
The federal government has a lot of webinars that have a lot of aims on how to build a federal resume.

261
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:17,460
But your supervisor name and phone number is a required component of that.

262
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:23,129
I have to circle back and say it's not a standard component of any resume, and so I recommend you have it on there.

263
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:28,970
Take it off. It's also a good time to talk about some people will list references on their resume.

264
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:32,670
I encourage you to have your own document of references,

265
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:36,780
not to include them on your resume because it's not a required component and it takes up a

266
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:41,130
lot of room that you're going to be using to describe your skills and experience otherwise.

267
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:46,290
All right. So some additional notes. Bullet points are strongly encouraged.

268
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:56,070
However, in your bullet points, you have an option of like a small circle filled in or a small square filled in some of this stuff.

269
00:27:56,580 --> 00:28:05,330
Right. I like this one. Or this one.

270
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:08,960
I like all of these. These are no girls. Just these two.

271
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:15,860
Yes. We really continue with the magical back to your supervisor and you're working on the research project.

272
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:22,290
And you you're working with a specific dogs or should you list them in your experience or not?

273
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:28,160
That's a great question. Typically, the best way to include API or a lab name or a supervisor,

274
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:33,710
particularly if they are well known in the field to which you're applying to, is to include their name in the organization.

275
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:40,850
So it could say University of Michigan School of Public Health Park Lab or University of Michigan School of

276
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:47,149
Information with and then the name of the person that you're working with so that it draws attention to their name,

277
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:50,780
but it doesn't necessarily have to include it into the description.

278
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:59,930
It could also be in your personal title. So you can say like a research assistant to be looking at those requests.

279
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:08,810
Any other questions? All right.

280
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:13,160
So bullet points are strongly encouraged. Please don't use the fancy ones in word.

281
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:18,650
I would also remind you that a function of a bullet point is that it has some kind of indent.

282
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:26,090
And so there needs to be a space between the start of the line and your bullet and then the bullet and the start of the text.

283
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:34,250
The reason of that is to maintain the white space and so that it is scannable too often I'll see like here's our paper, right?

284
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:42,680
And I've gone all the way to the edges. I've ignored Crystal's point five advice, and my bullet points are like right here and other taxes here.

285
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:48,080
And then it fills up the whole page. And it's not actually a bullet point, it's just a picture taking approach.

286
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:57,170
And so please make sure you do that. Also, standard is one page, unless there are people in the room that have more than ten years experience.

287
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:02,210
However, so this says two years. I think that's why.

288
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:06,560
And then federal government is 5 to 6 pages on average.

289
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:15,980
And so again, please check the final resume guidelines if you're choosing to go that way and use sections to group out your different experiences.

290
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:18,850
Again, for any international folks that are in the rooms,

291
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:24,560
this is particularly important when you're differentiating between your work experience and project experience.

292
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:32,180
And so again, discussions about that, please let me know what I want to help you protect your future visa status by currently labeling things.

293
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:37,820
And so with that, we're going to do some peer review now so that we have a little bit a break from me talking.

294
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,770
I'm your campus site. There is a room right? There is also printed copies here.

295
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:48,200
What we are going to do is just focus on page one, which is the one with the checklist on it,

296
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:52,070
where you are going to be reviewing your neighbor friend.

297
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:58,760
I don't care who, but someone else in this one's resume, so make sure that it's following the standard expectations for formatting.

298
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:06,140
And then if you have questions, I'm going to float around. We have maybe 10 minutes to do this.

299
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:09,740
We'll see if people get done faster than that. But that's the general timeline.

300
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:14,299
So if you want a printed copy, it's down here. It's also on canvas.

301
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:18,920
If you would like to do that online project, these are free for you to take.

302
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:26,000
One disclaimer that I forgot to make at the very beginning is every careers office will have slightly different advice.

303
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:31,970
So this is from the perspective of the University of Michigan, specifically the School of Public Health, of the School of Information.

304
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:36,250
And so please don't go back to your career advisors at your home institutions if be like well

305
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:41,209
Crystal at the University of Michigan said because that's annoying so just make sure that you're

306
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:46,280
following the general spirit of our advice is we want you to get a job and we telling you the best

307
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:50,780
information that we have available based on our training and what we hear from our employers.

308
00:31:51,350 --> 00:32:00,049
But any questions before we get started? With 10 minutes to review formatting, please don't read all the stuff.

309
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:03,560
We're going to do that next. Just doing formatting.

310
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:20,184
Hello? What's. So wasn't.

311
00:32:21,809 --> 00:32:29,669
Okay. We're going to get restarted. You got a couple of questions that came up that I think are important to note.

312
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:36,599
I've got a question about how do I get my stuff all the way over to the side if I'm just using words?

313
00:32:37,229 --> 00:32:45,659
Here's the very technical answer Are you ready to make space in space until it goes in the next line and then you push my at space?

314
00:32:47,789 --> 00:32:55,409
Tricky, right? You can insert a table, but that it's risky because not all tables are readable by the online system.

315
00:32:55,889 --> 00:32:59,938
And so I recommend just grow space based space until you get to the next flight.

316
00:32:59,939 --> 00:33:03,629
And I'm Glidewell after that because I like that it's like we are living in a

317
00:33:03,629 --> 00:33:08,248
world where we have all these computers and our best answer is space based space.

318
00:33:08,249 --> 00:33:15,389
Space. It's fine. Another question was What happens if I transferred or I got a community college degree?

319
00:33:16,109 --> 00:33:25,219
So community college, assuming that you can put that on there, if you got a certificate or associate's degree, if you just transfer credits,

320
00:33:25,229 --> 00:33:32,518
I recommend listing it as a bullet point underneath the degree that you are going to finish with remembering that just the end date is

321
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:38,429
what you need for your education because they just want to know you have the degree and there is a bias against people who transfer.

322
00:33:38,849 --> 00:33:44,189
And so we want to try to avoid that as much as possible. But then you're still being truthful about I got some credits from this.

323
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:50,239
And a person that came up. Yes. What about like a dual enrollment program?

324
00:33:50,549 --> 00:33:54,599
A dual enrollment program? Like from where you like high school?

325
00:33:54,659 --> 00:34:00,719
Yeah, it's up to you. You don't really have to listed that go through considered the for independence.

326
00:34:03,929 --> 00:34:08,248
And then we had some other questions about like what if my scale is weird for my GPA?

327
00:34:08,249 --> 00:34:11,789
If that's you can talk to me because there's a lot of different variations.

328
00:34:11,819 --> 00:34:15,209
Yes. I want you you stop including your high school now.

329
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:19,789
Okay. You don't even have a high school in your degree anymore or your experience.

330
00:34:20,249 --> 00:34:24,009
I'm assuming all of you were juniors and above not memorizing. Sophomore, I think sophomore.

331
00:34:24,029 --> 00:34:30,479
You can keep it on there, but you don't need to because you're in university and assumed that you have graduated from high school.

332
00:34:30,929 --> 00:34:35,089
The only time that it can really benefit you is if you know that there is this connection.

333
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:38,939
Like, for example, if you're from the state of Michigan and you live in Detroit,

334
00:34:38,939 --> 00:34:42,029
you know that Renaissance is one of the top high schools in the city of Detroit.

335
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:48,449
And the Renaissance alumni are very loyal. And so they're like, Yup, you went to Renaissance, I will help you out.

336
00:34:48,899 --> 00:34:52,978
And so again, you know that you have that kind of connection. Go ahead and keep your high school stuff on there.

337
00:34:52,979 --> 00:34:57,459
But in most cases, I would encourage you to take it off to maximize what you're seeing.

338
00:34:59,279 --> 00:35:03,779
Any other questions that came up in the peer review formatting part? Yes.

339
00:35:03,929 --> 00:35:11,129
If your study abroad place is in a different language and translating it makes no sense, what should you just use?

340
00:35:11,129 --> 00:35:14,189
It is like. Is that an exception for the acronym or no?

341
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:16,229
You should. I would right.

342
00:35:16,229 --> 00:35:22,739
Think the name of the institution and the other language and then write the name of the program typically is what I would recommend.

343
00:35:23,129 --> 00:35:29,669
And so if you like studied a language or like I did social work abroad, I put that as the title.

344
00:35:31,499 --> 00:35:38,639
Honestly, they just want to know where you went. Pretty much rarely does someone care, like where you studied abroad.

345
00:35:38,939 --> 00:35:43,389
They just want to know that you did it. Okay. It's interesting.

346
00:35:43,389 --> 00:35:46,448
I'll follow up with you later to find out what the translation is.

347
00:35:46,449 --> 00:35:50,879
That makes no sense. Well, it's like, yeah, okay. All right.

348
00:35:50,889 --> 00:35:59,089
So next we are going to talk about content. And so this is the point where we talk about like, yes, I encourage you future.

349
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:04,269
You will say thank you if you write about your experiences extensively now.

350
00:36:04,839 --> 00:36:08,859
And so this is what we would call a master copy of your resumé where you thought

351
00:36:08,859 --> 00:36:12,669
about these are the things that I may want to include in a future job search.

352
00:36:13,089 --> 00:36:17,168
If you continue to flesh it out and you work on it, you know, as you move on to your career,

353
00:36:17,169 --> 00:36:20,919
it feels really good to say, like, I have ten pages worth of stuff.

354
00:36:21,309 --> 00:36:27,939
I'm not there yet. I don't have six. But, you know, it feels nice to have that accumulation of stuff that you can pull from.

355
00:36:28,659 --> 00:36:33,038
That being said is that if you only have one page, you can only put so much stuff on there.

356
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:39,789
And so for resumes, if you are one of my students, either at School of Information or the School of Public Health, at this point of the presentation,

357
00:36:39,789 --> 00:36:45,279
I would I'll make you all raise your right hand and promise me that you would tailor every resume that you ever turn it.

358
00:36:46,029 --> 00:36:50,319
I'm not going to make you do that because it feels really scary. And you're not technically my students.

359
00:36:50,859 --> 00:36:55,989
But what I mean by that is I want you to think about how people are being selected to get job.

360
00:36:56,619 --> 00:37:04,299
It is a job description that is uploaded into a computer system and then AI technology matches your skills and experiences,

361
00:37:04,629 --> 00:37:11,019
likely using keywords to your resume. And that's how people decide do you get an interview or not?

362
00:37:11,619 --> 00:37:18,668
And so when I talk about tailoring, I'm talking about taking that master copy with all of your experiences and pulling out the

363
00:37:18,669 --> 00:37:24,609
most relevant things to create a tailored summary of my to be the right person for that job.

364
00:37:25,149 --> 00:37:32,079
And sometimes it means small tweaks. Like my favorite example is can someone tell me the difference between created and developed?

365
00:37:33,939 --> 00:37:38,918
I'm glad there's blank stares because there's not a lot. Yes, you had an answer I just created.

366
00:37:38,919 --> 00:37:42,819
You came up with the thing developed. You saw that thing progress.

367
00:37:43,659 --> 00:37:47,528
Sure. All right, Mike. We all do now. Like, that sounds good.

368
00:37:47,529 --> 00:37:54,669
Like. But if the job description only uses the word developed and you only use the word created, that's not a keyword match.

369
00:37:55,509 --> 00:37:59,079
And so we want to make sure that we are making those small changes for our

370
00:37:59,079 --> 00:38:03,129
job descriptions to make sure that we can trick the computer is thinking us.

371
00:38:03,369 --> 00:38:08,349
So you're not really freaking out. You're just showing that making it easier to make you for the interview.

372
00:38:09,999 --> 00:38:13,239
So we want to think about this in total.

373
00:38:13,239 --> 00:38:19,208
So now we're stepping back to the master resume where we think about what makes you promotable, what have you done?

374
00:38:19,209 --> 00:38:28,358
That's you. What have you done that's not unique. What has been paid, unpaid volunteer service, institutional work, internships, really anything.

375
00:38:28,359 --> 00:38:32,769
That is an experience that you can say, this is why I'm qualified to do a job.

376
00:38:33,189 --> 00:38:39,338
You want to start reflecting on fear. Sometimes we can skip over these by different sections.

377
00:38:39,339 --> 00:38:45,549
So let's say in your future career, you're maybe thinking about going more stats rounds or maybe project management.

378
00:38:46,029 --> 00:38:53,109
Then you could have two different general copies of your resume that is tailored towards moving parts.

379
00:38:53,949 --> 00:39:01,959
But we we think about those largely speaking, and then as we move towards that, to group them in a way that makes sense for the job.

380
00:39:02,469 --> 00:39:08,139
For example, if you want to do like a research assistant job moving forward, you probably want to have a research section.

381
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:10,239
Or if you're going into consulting,

382
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:17,288
I would tend to recommend having a leadership experience section because consulting months leaders and then from there,

383
00:39:17,289 --> 00:39:21,219
so you pick your experiences and then you pick the order of your bullets.

384
00:39:21,699 --> 00:39:27,399
Oftentimes when we're writing a resume, you start with, I did this first and then I did this and then I did this.

385
00:39:27,399 --> 00:39:31,778
And it was the biggest thing I did because at the end we want to think about what

386
00:39:31,779 --> 00:39:36,219
the reader is going to care about most and put that first in our order of list.

387
00:39:36,789 --> 00:39:39,188
Because if we go back to that eye tracking document,

388
00:39:39,189 --> 00:39:43,209
they're going to scan the beginning of the bullets and they're going to scan the first one primarily.

389
00:39:43,629 --> 00:39:48,189
And so you want to prioritize the information that they're most likely going to seek in your resume.

390
00:39:48,879 --> 00:39:55,329
That's why we put the education first, because that's the door that you walk through, questions that.

391
00:39:56,549 --> 00:40:01,919
Yes. So you're like, I guess doing the most important things first.

392
00:40:02,039 --> 00:40:06,329
Can you ignore the chronological order? Right. That's a great question.

393
00:40:06,359 --> 00:40:12,929
The experiences themselves have to be in front of reverse chronological order, but the bullet points themself do not.

394
00:40:14,399 --> 00:40:19,859
The way that you pick it around, like let's say you had an experience two years ago, that's more important than your job.

395
00:40:20,249 --> 00:40:23,279
We can create different sections that help us to reorder stuff.

396
00:40:23,279 --> 00:40:30,959
So that's where we can use those adjectives about like project management, leadership research, all those types of things to move that up to the top.

397
00:40:34,309 --> 00:40:37,789
Other questions. These are good ones.

398
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:49,319
Yes. Like, how would you describe like what would be a good alternative for a heading of, like, extracurricular experiences, like club leadership.

399
00:40:49,529 --> 00:40:54,679
Leadership experience. Yes. Or, you know, if you're applying in academia, a service is also a good one.

400
00:40:55,489 --> 00:41:04,019
But most often student orgs you list out of. All right.

401
00:41:04,309 --> 00:41:09,529
So when we approached Hillary, after you write in your master copy, as you first start with the job description,

402
00:41:10,519 --> 00:41:15,199
for me that means like physically highlighting a job description to identify key words,

403
00:41:15,199 --> 00:41:21,769
actions and results so that I can have the same type of words that show up in my resume as the job description.

404
00:41:23,449 --> 00:41:28,758
Well, I also want to make sure that we're looking for the type of experience that they want to make

405
00:41:28,759 --> 00:41:33,918
sure that we're showing that this is the reason I put this on here is because experience,

406
00:41:33,919 --> 00:41:35,539
first of all, is not just paid.

407
00:41:35,959 --> 00:41:43,489
And as you go into the workforce, something that you should know about H.R. lag is that the 3 to 5 years of experience,

408
00:41:43,579 --> 00:41:52,339
90% of the time that's completely made up. Just like generally benchmarking to do this job, you should probably have 3 to 5 years experience.

409
00:41:52,849 --> 00:42:01,129
And so if you're within five or less years of what you're looking for and you feel like you can do the job, I say apply anyway.

410
00:42:01,699 --> 00:42:08,569
So even if they're looking for 5 to 7 years experience and you only only have three and you feel like you can do it,

411
00:42:08,569 --> 00:42:14,538
let me give you permission to apply to the job. It's just your responsibility to make sure that you're showing them.

412
00:42:14,539 --> 00:42:17,169
I have all the skills and qualifications that you're looking for.

413
00:42:17,729 --> 00:42:22,308
I think the reason that this is important is because people of underrepresented identities

414
00:42:22,309 --> 00:42:28,459
and women are like 30% likely to apply to a job if they meet some of their qualifications.

415
00:42:29,299 --> 00:42:34,399
White men are like 95% likely to apply to a job if they meet some of the qualifications.

416
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:41,538
And so the best piece of advice I ever got, someone when I was going through the job search process was to find your upper class,

417
00:42:41,539 --> 00:42:45,289
privileged white man name and then apply to his job.

418
00:42:46,099 --> 00:42:49,939
And so, you know, his name is Karl. Karl is very confident.

419
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:51,879
He sells myself really hard.

420
00:42:51,889 --> 00:43:00,329
Is I guess Crystal is the best person for this job because I use all the same keywords, I use all the same results, and she gets the job right.

421
00:43:00,439 --> 00:43:07,119
So we want to embrace that same type of privilege. If you think you can do the job, make the case and apply it.

422
00:43:11,389 --> 00:43:14,389
All right. So next, we're going to talk about my points.

423
00:43:14,389 --> 00:43:19,159
And this is where it becomes really important that we think about stepping away from.

424
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:25,039
These are the things that I would do, because a resume is all about the skills that you have.

425
00:43:25,729 --> 00:43:31,639
And so we're going to use a structure called the ACR structure, which stands for Action Context Control.

426
00:43:32,149 --> 00:43:36,528
In some environments, this might be called the card structure. Maybe it's related to star.

427
00:43:36,529 --> 00:43:43,879
Like this is the part where it often looks the most difference between different careers offices, but the general essence is the same.

428
00:43:44,449 --> 00:43:50,869
And so I have this example where we synthesize data from three companywide surveys into a comprehensive

429
00:43:51,259 --> 00:43:56,209
report to identify areas of improvement for employers satisfaction and feelings of inclusion,

430
00:43:56,539 --> 00:43:59,909
which feels like a really long thing when you read it out loud.

431
00:43:59,909 --> 00:44:06,108
But this fits on one bullet point 11 space five in times zero is so cool.

432
00:44:06,109 --> 00:44:10,279
We like that. So this is me giving you permission to expand a little bit more on your voice.

433
00:44:11,179 --> 00:44:15,949
So you might be asking, Chris, what does this mean? Well, we're going to start with action.

434
00:44:15,949 --> 00:44:19,489
So that action describes what you did.

435
00:44:19,999 --> 00:44:27,079
This is what I most often see on resumes, where you kind of just list the tasks that you've done and you want to use a strong verb.

436
00:44:27,319 --> 00:44:34,219
And so something to keep in mind is my least favorite verbs on a resume are the words assisted and supported.

437
00:44:34,879 --> 00:44:44,118
And you have any idea why I might not like this? Because it shows that it implies that you weren't like the leader.

438
00:44:44,119 --> 00:44:47,509
You were just helping somebody else. Maybe I wasn't the leader. You had your hand up.

439
00:44:48,259 --> 00:44:51,469
Oh, yeah. It just puts the focus on someone else. Yeah, I think.

440
00:44:51,469 --> 00:44:56,649
Puts all he gives away all of your power because it's like I help someone else in.

441
00:44:56,729 --> 00:45:01,129
So why not? Thinking about these verbs? We want to think about what did I do to assist?

442
00:45:01,549 --> 00:45:04,769
How did I support? What is this? Can I contribute to it?

443
00:45:05,149 --> 00:45:09,499
Because if we think about it and use supporting data analysis where you're doing data analysis.

444
00:45:11,219 --> 00:45:17,518
Probably. I thought you were still doing it. Even if you were a part of the team or you were part of a collaborative,

445
00:45:17,519 --> 00:45:21,539
or you were giving your work to someone else, like you were still completing the valuable work.

446
00:45:23,289 --> 00:45:29,399
So we want to think about that. Some important nodes just structurally as if it is an ongoing experience.

447
00:45:29,819 --> 00:45:35,369
You're going to listen as present tense. If it's a past experience, it's going to be this past tense.

448
00:45:35,789 --> 00:45:39,869
Where it gets tricky is if you've already completed a task in a job that you're currently doing.

449
00:45:40,799 --> 00:45:44,549
In that case, you would still listen as present tense because you're still in that job.

450
00:45:44,549 --> 00:45:54,009
So the tense goes to the job, not the task. And then, yeah, so we think about what did I do to contribute value to the organization?

451
00:45:54,309 --> 00:46:02,409
And oftentimes you want to think about this as the skill that you're trying to show in a case where we have something like supported or assisted.

452
00:46:02,739 --> 00:46:08,319
This is where we want to think about what is it that I'm trying to show? Is it the data analysis or is it the collaboration?

453
00:46:08,889 --> 00:46:16,719
Because if it's working as a part of a team that you might use words like collaborative way, communicating, etc., etc., instead of the analyzed.

454
00:46:17,049 --> 00:46:20,219
And so we step back, we think, What did I do? What was the skill that action?

455
00:46:22,789 --> 00:46:26,748
And then it's just to protect. This is the easiest way to often align a job description.

456
00:46:26,749 --> 00:46:28,039
In most of them.

457
00:46:28,159 --> 00:46:35,509
There will be a bulleted list of responsibilities if you can name those same responsibilities on your job from the job description on your resume,

458
00:46:35,539 --> 00:46:39,229
you're very likely to get an interview because you're like, Look, I've done this because I've already done this.

459
00:46:40,099 --> 00:46:46,519
Maybe this is a handout that you can find regularly on the Internet.

460
00:46:46,519 --> 00:46:53,419
If you search for words, powerful words out of a resume, just use some critical thinking about how you're going to apply those if you get stuck.

461
00:46:55,669 --> 00:47:00,139
The next part is context. Context is where we think about how you did what you did.

462
00:47:00,469 --> 00:47:04,509
And so this is where we can think about significance, constraints, scope.

463
00:47:04,519 --> 00:47:08,719
It can also be about process and software that you have included.

464
00:47:09,229 --> 00:47:13,758
And so this this is where I most often see numbers like how much, how many,

465
00:47:13,759 --> 00:47:18,419
how often in the case of collaboration, it might be how often did you meet?

466
00:47:18,439 --> 00:47:27,469
How many people that you were? The type of people that do the analysis it might be the methods, the tools and the software that you use.

467
00:47:27,829 --> 00:47:29,718
There's a lot of things that go into this,

468
00:47:29,719 --> 00:47:35,809
and the reason that we want to think about the context is because first you've shown I can do the job because I've already done it.

469
00:47:36,199 --> 00:47:40,309
The next part is I can do the job and do it in the way that you want me to do it.

470
00:47:40,789 --> 00:47:44,719
And so we think about this is often showing the hard skills that they're going to be

471
00:47:44,719 --> 00:47:50,088
looking for in the job and where you can most likely fit in the soft skills as well.

472
00:47:50,089 --> 00:47:56,869
So you can say through communicating my results, which, you know, communication is a soft skill that can be sometimes hard to predict.

473
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:07,269
I'm. Okay. So as we're thinking about this part, you want to assume that the reader is familiar with the work ish,

474
00:48:07,879 --> 00:48:11,899
but maybe not entrenched in it are really good example.

475
00:48:12,199 --> 00:48:15,799
I know we had someone mentioned earlier like if you're working on research with API,

476
00:48:16,099 --> 00:48:22,639
the very specific protein that they're working with in their research that you're helping with data analysis with no one cares about,

477
00:48:23,629 --> 00:48:30,139
right is a very narrow lag time. Like I focus on this one pinpoint thing in a very large field which is a part of a large field,

478
00:48:30,139 --> 00:48:33,829
which is a part of maybe they just want to know what I'm good at.

479
00:48:34,519 --> 00:48:40,338
And so we want to keep it broad enough that it can relate to many different positions and show that it's transferable,

480
00:48:40,339 --> 00:48:47,039
not a specific Ph.D. type of thing unless you're going into a Ph.D., in which case I recommend you talk to someone else.

481
00:48:47,289 --> 00:48:51,349
That last part as a result.

482
00:48:51,469 --> 00:48:58,819
And so this is the thing that I most often see missing from a resume, because it's hard to say what happens if you want.

483
00:48:58,819 --> 00:49:02,489
It's not done to you don't know or three. It didn't turn out the way you want.

484
00:49:03,709 --> 00:49:07,009
And so instead of thinking like, what is the end product?

485
00:49:07,129 --> 00:49:11,659
Because that's pretty easy in those cases, you want to quantify it as much as possible.

486
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:16,399
In the cases where you don't know that, you want to think, Well, why was this task important?

487
00:49:16,969 --> 00:49:21,619
Why would someone pay me to do this? Or having me do it to contribute to that?

488
00:49:22,369 --> 00:49:27,829
And so this is where we think about what is it that you gave to the organizations?

489
00:49:29,179 --> 00:49:34,998
For my undergrad work study job, I did a lot of copying of receipts, so I was administrative assistant.

490
00:49:34,999 --> 00:49:40,669
It was great. However, I don't write like to copy receipts on my resume.

491
00:49:41,099 --> 00:49:45,289
Instead, I was providing valuable recordkeeping for $1,000,000,000 grant.

492
00:49:46,589 --> 00:49:51,139
You see the difference between those two things? The result was me copying the receipts.

493
00:49:51,589 --> 00:49:55,819
The value was me to help them provide records for this grant.

494
00:49:56,569 --> 00:50:00,019
So we always want to step back and see what the value that you have.

495
00:50:00,289 --> 00:50:05,039
My soapbox on this is if you see value in yourself, other people will see value in you.

496
00:50:05,479 --> 00:50:10,069
And so try to embody that. Remember our white upper class entitled White Man?

497
00:50:10,489 --> 00:50:14,869
Think about what he's going to do on your behalf. That's where the results come from.

498
00:50:16,849 --> 00:50:23,029
So they don't always go in this order. Sometimes it's more powerful to start with the results.

499
00:50:23,029 --> 00:50:30,929
So if you increased efficiency, found something significant, published a paper, etc., etc., you can start with that on your bullet points.

500
00:50:30,949 --> 00:50:35,299
Because remember our eye tracking document, they read the first part of the bullet point first.

501
00:50:35,749 --> 00:50:39,799
If that is the most important thing that you want to communicate, you can go ahead and start with that.

502
00:50:40,249 --> 00:50:43,959
And so sometimes it goes result action time. That's cool.

503
00:50:43,969 --> 00:50:50,209
I don't care. As long as it answers the three main questions of what you did, how you did it, and why it was important.

504
00:50:53,149 --> 00:51:00,919
So of take quick breath and really talk quickly about the additional sections so we have time to do some more peer review.

505
00:51:01,849 --> 00:51:04,819
So leadership activities is something we touched on earlier.

506
00:51:04,849 --> 00:51:11,479
Oftentimes this is things like towards any type of project leadership that you have in class or things like that.

507
00:51:11,899 --> 00:51:19,489
This can be particularly important if you're applying to consulting roles in the future because we all want to see some kind of leadership.

508
00:51:19,489 --> 00:51:24,168
I know for a specific example would be so not consulting, but at Chevron,

509
00:51:24,169 --> 00:51:27,469
if you don't have two leadership experiences on your resume and they want even.

510
00:51:28,549 --> 00:51:30,559
And so just something to keep in mind.

511
00:51:31,579 --> 00:51:38,358
You'll note that it should be listed in the exact same ways as the other experience sections where it has the name of the organization,

512
00:51:38,359 --> 00:51:41,689
the title, the location, the dates, bullet points, etc.

513
00:51:42,229 --> 00:51:48,088
Because if you just list like student activities and then you have a list like that been how leadership,

514
00:51:48,089 --> 00:51:52,499
black student association, really whatever it is and you just list the dates.

515
00:51:52,519 --> 00:52:00,049
That doesn't tell me anything other than you did it. I want to know what the skills are that you know.

516
00:52:00,679 --> 00:52:04,309
So leadership activities and pause, see if there are questions about that.

517
00:52:05,329 --> 00:52:09,889
Essentially, I want to do listing in the same way as experience can offer leadership,

518
00:52:10,099 --> 00:52:16,009
separate volunteering and all the questions because there's a separate from volunteering.

519
00:52:16,369 --> 00:52:19,009
This is great because I forgot to say this in the experience section.

520
00:52:19,519 --> 00:52:26,869
I personally hate the titles, professional experience and volunteer experience, but it literally tells me nothing about your skills.

521
00:52:27,529 --> 00:52:31,819
Instead, I would rather see like a descriptive word in front of that.

522
00:52:31,969 --> 00:52:37,669
So, like, what kind of professional experience? What what do you want me to take away from your volunteering experience?

523
00:52:38,299 --> 00:52:41,899
The only true exception to that is if you're doing project work at school,

524
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:48,739
or particularly if you're an international student, you have to listed as projects for visa things.

525
00:52:49,429 --> 00:52:53,569
Yeah. The difference between volunteer and leadership. I don't care.

526
00:52:54,499 --> 00:52:59,899
It's more about what you want me to know about you because of that. That's a good question.

527
00:53:01,219 --> 00:53:05,719
Other questions? Well.

528
00:53:05,859 --> 00:53:10,469
So some other things, publications and presentations used to be a no go on resume.

529
00:53:10,469 --> 00:53:14,188
So if you're talking to someone that's like 40 and older, they're going to be like, Don't do that.

530
00:53:14,189 --> 00:53:19,469
I'm going to tell you. Go ahead and do that. Presentations and publications can be listed on a resume.

531
00:53:19,499 --> 00:53:26,519
Now, there's a few different places that you can put that you can put them as a bullet point underneath the experience that they're associated with.

532
00:53:27,059 --> 00:53:32,368
You can list them as a bullet point as a part of your degree, or you can have your own section about it.

533
00:53:32,369 --> 00:53:35,459
So here's an example where you have publications and presentations.

534
00:53:36,239 --> 00:53:40,949
The way that you're always going to list it now is like a document in a worksite.

535
00:53:41,399 --> 00:53:44,909
So you, as you know, the authors names, the dates, the titles, the publication,

536
00:53:44,909 --> 00:53:49,468
etc., you want to use the same format as the field that you're going into.

537
00:53:49,469 --> 00:53:57,929
So if it's public health and take it out and you bold your name in the list, so pretty straightforward save for presentation.

538
00:53:59,339 --> 00:54:06,149
We had a question about skills earlier. So this is the part about skills where in your skill section you want to try to group them.

539
00:54:06,479 --> 00:54:15,299
So we think about overall headers. So software programing, languages, tools, research methods, etc., you want a colon.

540
00:54:15,539 --> 00:54:22,679
And then a list of important thing to note here is that applicant tracking systems, the machine that's going to read it,

541
00:54:22,709 --> 00:54:34,319
will read it best if you do colon list, comma, no space on those items, no spaces after the words.

542
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:40,239
So it would be like. So let's say I'm doing software.

543
00:54:41,859 --> 00:54:45,459
Everyone see this? Forward.

544
00:54:45,879 --> 00:54:53,319
And then I'm going to write as happy as as no space, comma, actual space.

545
00:54:53,889 --> 00:55:01,679
And I'm in the right time. Our space and whatever it is.

546
00:55:01,949 --> 00:55:06,989
Does that make sense? So there can't be a space between the item and the comma.

547
00:55:07,499 --> 00:55:12,509
This is a really weird thing that I don't know why it's true, but I here I am giving you this information,

548
00:55:13,769 --> 00:55:16,859
and then you want to make sure that there's the colon before the title.

549
00:55:17,729 --> 00:55:21,569
Yes. It's like, where does the like the advance go or like intermediate?

550
00:55:21,749 --> 00:55:24,759
Oh, that's a great question. I have said this.

551
00:55:25,229 --> 00:55:28,409
This is something I bought learned this summer. I apologize that I have not updated this.

552
00:55:28,619 --> 00:55:33,059
You don't need to label them anymore because everyone labels it differently.

553
00:55:33,569 --> 00:55:36,599
My math is different than your advanced your. I don't know how to define that.

554
00:55:37,019 --> 00:55:42,489
I would be like extra intermediate beginner and then versus someone else.

555
00:55:42,509 --> 00:55:45,869
They might be like my level, but their knowledge is good enough.

556
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:53,679
And so they would consider it advanced, but we don't know. So just take that off unless it is a spoken language, in which case you do.

557
00:55:53,699 --> 00:56:01,469
What was a good question? Yes. So the reason that, like spoken written languages are important is because you don't want to list that.

558
00:56:01,469 --> 00:56:09,299
You're like, you know, at one point in time I do Spanish and I put it up on a resume, but I don't put like written.

559
00:56:09,629 --> 00:56:12,959
I don't want to show up at an interview and someone expects me to speak Spanish.

560
00:56:13,499 --> 00:56:15,449
That would be horrifying. It happens to people.

561
00:56:15,459 --> 00:56:22,379
So if it's a difference like spoken, written language, proficiency level programing, software, etc., you don't.

562
00:56:25,089 --> 00:56:31,689
It's a real language. Is it better to put advanced or the C to test results?

563
00:56:32,139 --> 00:56:35,088
Oh, for languages you would put it,

564
00:56:35,089 --> 00:56:43,629
it's more about like so the common ones for communication languages would be like really conversational professionals native.

565
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:53,939
Type of thing. Like in what case can you sit? There's nothing new.

566
00:56:55,389 --> 00:57:00,778
So I have a brief summary of this and I'm sure we'll have a good time.

567
00:57:00,779 --> 00:57:07,259
We're doing some good on. Like.

568
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:14,719
Continue. Mean.

569
00:57:39,409 --> 00:57:48,649
Know, I'm.

570
00:58:36,239 --> 00:59:04,699
There. We're not going to give you the examples we have time for.

571
00:59:05,709 --> 00:59:09,619
Let's go. So here.

572
00:59:10,009 --> 00:59:14,069
So if you flip over the checklist side of your restaurant review,

573
00:59:14,149 --> 00:59:20,449
right on the back is incompetency assessments can't be reviewed because we only have 10 minutes.

574
00:59:20,459 --> 00:59:26,838
I would encourage you to ask your partner to look at one entry which might have multiple bullet points to you.

575
00:59:26,839 --> 00:59:33,259
This way you can choose either your strongest one that you want feedback for or the one that you think you need the most help with.

576
00:59:33,259 --> 00:59:36,809
And then you can kind of talk through how much you show different types of skills.

577
00:59:39,009 --> 00:59:42,498
So that's we're going to do one or two entries best, worst,

578
00:59:42,499 --> 00:59:48,619
but you're going to use those competency markers to look at the context of the things that people wrote out that we really looked at.

579
00:59:48,929 --> 00:59:53,869
This is not what we're used to,

580
00:59:54,619 --> 00:59:57,889
and it's back on the page and we'll circle back and we'll talk about how to

581
00:59:57,889 --> 01:00:05,819
put the data on your resume as the final lecture moment to talk about things,

582
01:00:06,439 --> 01:00:12,346
because we're just going to be there, just like we actually know someone who's written her.

583
01:00:12,654 --> 01:00:19,734
That's okay. I imagine you're not done because, as I said, doing a resume, it takes on average 3 hours.

584
01:00:20,964 --> 01:00:22,974
I want to circle back to that just a little bit,

585
01:00:22,974 --> 01:00:32,544
because there's a lot of new thoughts from career development offices that there is there's a lot of energy spent being making a perfect resume.

586
01:00:32,614 --> 01:00:36,324
And I'm telling you right now, there's no such thing as a perfect resume.

587
01:00:36,414 --> 01:00:43,434
And so one of the approaches that I've recently taken in doing career advising is getting your resume making good enough and turning in it.

588
01:00:44,244 --> 01:00:49,754
Because if we think about it like a 95% and a 98%, there's still no case.

589
01:00:50,034 --> 01:00:51,924
You're probably still going to get the interview.

590
01:00:52,344 --> 01:01:01,054
And so the amount of time, energy, effort and emotional energy spent for making a perfect resume is generally not that much.

591
01:01:01,554 --> 01:01:06,384
And so we put our best effort in creating a master document that shows your skills and qualifications.

592
01:01:06,984 --> 01:01:12,384
You do some tailoring to match the job description and then turn it in and let it go.

593
01:01:13,154 --> 01:01:19,644
Right? Well, so you follow things like that. But you know what? Let yourself be free of this idea of a perfect us that doesn't exist.

594
01:01:20,784 --> 01:01:25,554
Question A few questions that I got during the peer review is one of them was when

595
01:01:25,554 --> 01:01:29,294
I talked about looking at the job description and adding words to your resume,

596
01:01:29,364 --> 01:01:33,624
you literally mean copy paste some of the words from the job description in your resume?

597
01:01:34,104 --> 01:01:39,384
Yes, I do. I don't recommend having more than four or five words in a row that are exactly the same.

598
01:01:39,924 --> 01:01:49,464
But if it says late data analysis in blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, you're going to data analysis and blah blah blah blah blah, right?

599
01:01:49,474 --> 01:01:53,094
Like you want to use the exact same words so that they're easily translatable.

600
01:01:53,124 --> 01:01:57,594
Make it easy for them to say yes. All right.

601
01:01:57,924 --> 01:02:01,604
So final resumé check. We're going to add in Pay Day to summarize it.

602
01:02:01,614 --> 01:02:05,244
Yeah, it's the last one I know I'm going over. I promised I wouldn't say, here I am.

603
01:02:06,444 --> 01:02:10,534
We're going to talk for two more minutes. How do you add this to as I me?

604
01:02:10,564 --> 01:02:14,904
There's a few different options. One of them could be listed as a bullet point.

605
01:02:14,904 --> 01:02:21,173
Underneath the degree that you're currently completing, you want to just make sure that it includes where it happened.

606
01:02:21,174 --> 01:02:26,544
So at the University of Michigan, you want to use the title and that you want to include.

607
01:02:26,544 --> 01:02:34,794
When it happened in parentheses, you'll notice that my parentheses are not in line with my education because it does not result in a full degree.

608
01:02:35,274 --> 01:02:38,504
But it does show this is the timeline and that it was recently.

609
01:02:39,144 --> 01:02:46,374
Another option could be in an experienced section such as leadership or training or data analysis or however you're arranging it,

610
01:02:46,854 --> 01:02:52,343
in which case you would follow the same organizational pattern that you have in the rest of your document.

611
01:02:52,344 --> 01:02:57,444
So I listed the name of the institution, how you lost your title, the dates, the location,

612
01:02:57,444 --> 01:03:04,614
etc. It should be the exact same as everything else, in which case you would want to make sure that you write a bullet point about.

613
01:03:04,674 --> 01:03:11,284
The things that you want me to know about you because of this program, if you just listed as this thing,

614
01:03:11,304 --> 01:03:16,194
if you just want to list it and assume that someone knows what you gained, you would put that in the education.

615
01:03:16,884 --> 01:03:23,564
You want to list some specific skills that came out of it, or why you're qualified for a job because you did this program.

616
01:03:23,574 --> 01:03:26,864
I would encourage you to list it as I experienced section.

617
01:03:29,614 --> 01:03:33,003
All right. So we can review this is available on your campus site.

618
01:03:33,004 --> 01:03:36,124
So if you forget it's already typed out for you and saved everything like that.

619
01:03:37,384 --> 01:03:43,474
So we want to make sure that we are looking at our resume holistically before we turn it in as good enough.

620
01:03:43,984 --> 01:03:52,503
So you want to make sure that you've included relevant information. You can use the buzzwords and keywords from the documents to make sure that it's

621
01:03:52,504 --> 01:03:56,624
showing that you have the skills and qualifications that we're looking for.

622
01:03:57,154 --> 01:04:05,014
We also want to step back and be like, Yo, was that truthful? And it's really easy as you're like digging into the ACR method to really sell yourself.

623
01:04:05,734 --> 01:04:11,474
But we still want to make sure that if someone asks us about it on our interview that it's true because you need to be able to talk about it.

624
01:04:12,634 --> 01:04:16,894
And then we make sure that we've drawn connections between the skills and the experiences by using the

625
01:04:16,894 --> 01:04:21,574
same type of keywords in the same type of language as what they are and what they're looking for.

626
01:04:22,294 --> 01:04:26,494
Results and results oriented to show that you bring value.

627
01:04:26,824 --> 01:04:30,453
And then finally, you want to make sure that it's error free, concise and well written.

628
01:04:30,454 --> 01:04:34,113
Because my favorite career services joke is that you don't want to show up with a resume.

629
01:04:34,114 --> 01:04:39,244
I want you to use on your butt instead of one. And then with that, I have time for questions.

630
01:04:39,254 --> 01:04:43,324
I would say I will have lunch next, but thank you for coming to this.

631
01:04:43,324 --> 01:04:47,104
It was great to meet you all. I think this is being important.

632
01:04:47,344 --> 01:04:53,554
There is one question, but I don't know how.
