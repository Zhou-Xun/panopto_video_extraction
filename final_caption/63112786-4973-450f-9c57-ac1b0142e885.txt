1
00:00:07,264 --> 00:00:11,264
Please note that sometimes ecologic studies are called ecological studies.

2
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:16,264
So you will hear me refer to it in both ways.

3
00:00:16,264 --> 00:00:23,264
We will first introduce the basic design of ecological studies and then the types of measures we use in ecological studies,

4
00:00:23,264 --> 00:00:30,264
levels of analysis and levels of interference. And we'll finally introduce the ecological fallacy.

5
00:00:30,264 --> 00:00:37,264
Ecologic studies use populations or groups of individuals as the unit of observation.

6
00:00:37,264 --> 00:00:42,264
Thus the unit of analysis in an ecological study is the group.

7
00:00:42,264 --> 00:00:47,264
And so this means that an important characteristic of ecologic studies is that the

8
00:00:47,264 --> 00:00:54,264
level of exposure for each individual in the unit or group being studied is unknown.

9
00:00:54,264 --> 00:01:01,264
We'll dig into what that means a little bit more in the coming slides.

10
00:01:01,264 --> 00:01:08,264
So we use average group data to assess exposure and outcome relationships at the group level.

11
00:01:08,264 --> 00:01:13,264
This is in contrast to all other study designs that we've discussed up until this point,

12
00:01:13,264 --> 00:01:17,264
which assess exposure, outcome relationships at the individual level.

13
00:01:17,264 --> 00:01:23,264
So, for example, in the cohort studies, cross-sectional studies, and trials that we've discussed so far,

14
00:01:23,264 --> 00:01:30,264
we measure an individual person's level of exposure and an individual person's outcome.

15
00:01:30,264 --> 00:01:36,264
But here in an ecological study, we are measuring outcomes at the level of the group without knowing what any

16
00:01:36,264 --> 00:01:42,264
given person within that group has for their level of exposure or outcome.

17
00:01:42,264 --> 00:01:48,264
So study groups are units in an ecological study are typically defined on the basis of geography.

18
00:01:48,264 --> 00:01:53,264
So it can be, for example, a country, a state, a county or a census tract.

19
00:01:53,264 --> 00:02:00,264
And exposure or outcome data are often things that are routinely collected at these levels of geography.

20
00:02:00,264 --> 00:02:06,264
For example, vital statistics such as birth rates, mortality rates for that level of geography,

21
00:02:06,264 --> 00:02:14,264
economic factors, employment factors such as unemployment rates or demographics statistics.

22
00:02:14,264 --> 00:02:20,264
So why would we perform an ecologic study? Well, they are low cost and they are very convenient.

23
00:02:20,264 --> 00:02:27,264
We can often do an ecological study on the basis of publicly available, routinely collected data.

24
00:02:27,264 --> 00:02:30,264
Sometimes individual level studies don't have the data we're looking for,

25
00:02:30,264 --> 00:02:39,264
and so we may do an ecological study out of convenience. Another reason is that we may have interest in an ecological effect.

26
00:02:39,264 --> 00:02:48,264
And so what this means more precisely is that there are some group level variables that really have real meaning and effects at the individual level.

27
00:02:48,264 --> 00:02:55,264
So these would be things like policies such as a universal health care policy or state unemployment benefits.

28
00:02:55,264 --> 00:03:00,264
They might also be aggregate measures such as area level poverty or unemployment,

29
00:03:00,264 --> 00:03:05,264
the level of income inequality in a given country or state or level of violence.

30
00:03:05,264 --> 00:03:11,264
And these are all indicators of the broader social, structural and economic contexts in which people live.

31
00:03:11,264 --> 00:03:18,264
And we know that these things really have real meaning for individual people's lives and health outcomes.

32
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:23,264
So on one level, ecological studies can be convenient and sometimes the only form of data that are available.

33
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:32,264
But on another level, there sometimes are real substantive meaning behind some ecologic measures.

34
00:03:32,264 --> 00:03:35,264
So let's review some ecologic measures.

35
00:03:35,264 --> 00:03:44,264
This slide right here shows a real kind of prime example of an ecological study or an ecological correlation.

36
00:03:44,264 --> 00:03:53,264
When we talk about measures of association and ecological studies, we often talk about correlations because we are really often uninclined to think

37
00:03:53,264 --> 00:03:58,264
about causal relationships at the individual level using ecological data.

38
00:03:58,264 --> 00:04:09,264
This slide shows on the X axis the mean total dietary fat intake at the level of a country for all of the countries shown on this slide.

39
00:04:09,264 --> 00:04:18,264
So, for example, for Thailand in the bottom left hand corner, the mean total dietary fat intake.

40
00:04:18,264 --> 00:04:27,264
In Thailand, looks like it's something about twenty five grams per day on average in the population of Thailand on the Y axis.

41
00:04:27,264 --> 00:04:32,264
We of age adjusted death rate per 100000 population.

42
00:04:32,264 --> 00:04:40,264
And so what this shows is, of course, the correlation between mean total dietary fat intake and mortality.

43
00:04:40,264 --> 00:04:46,264
And this is specifically breast cancer mortality for all of the countries shown here.

44
00:04:46,264 --> 00:04:48,264
So we can see that countries that have on average,

45
00:04:48,264 --> 00:04:58,264
higher total dietary fat intake among their populations also have higher age adjusted death rates due to breast cancer.

46
00:04:58,264 --> 00:05:01,264
So what can we conclude from this slide?

47
00:05:01,264 --> 00:05:10,264
It might be tempting to conclude that there is an association between dietary fat intake and mortality due to breast cancer.

48
00:05:10,264 --> 00:05:19,264
But the key thing that we have to remember here is that we are using ecological or group level data and not individual level data.

49
00:05:19,264 --> 00:05:26,264
What this means is we have no idea of knowing whether those individual specific individuals in a given country

50
00:05:26,264 --> 00:05:39,264
who have high dietary fat intake also are more likely to be those who die of breast cancer mortality.

51
00:05:39,264 --> 00:05:45,264
Here's another example. This is a figure that you saw in the introductory session to the course,

52
00:05:45,264 --> 00:05:51,264
which shows obesity trends among U.S. adults using data from the births in 2010.

53
00:05:51,264 --> 00:06:01,264
And so what this shows is the percentage or the prevalence of having a BMI of 30 or more across all U.S. states.

54
00:06:01,264 --> 00:06:03,264
And now this is, of course,

55
00:06:03,264 --> 00:06:12,264
and you should be able to interpret this, knowing what you know from the last few slides as a prime example of an ecological measure.

56
00:06:12,264 --> 00:06:24,264
This shows a prevalence rate for a group which is here defined as being a U.S. state.

57
00:06:24,264 --> 00:06:31,264
Now, let's talk about levels of analysis in ecological studies. As you may have inferred from the last two slides,

58
00:06:31,264 --> 00:06:41,264
that unit of analysis and an ecological study is the common or group level for which data on all variables measured in the study are analyzed.

59
00:06:41,264 --> 00:06:48,264
And now, within the broader umbrella of ecological studies, there are a few different ways to do this.

60
00:06:48,264 --> 00:07:00,264
So let's go through them. In an individual level analysis, a value for each each ecological variable is assigned to every subject in the study.

61
00:07:00,264 --> 00:07:07,264
So this is a special case of an ecological study design where we actually have individuals present in our study,

62
00:07:07,264 --> 00:07:13,264
but we are taking ecological measures and assigning those ecological measures to an individual.

63
00:07:13,264 --> 00:07:19,264
In the study, say, for example, we take a random sample of all adults in the United States.

64
00:07:19,264 --> 00:07:27,264
We may be interested in attributes about places where they live, such as whether a certain policy is in place in their country or state.

65
00:07:27,264 --> 00:07:34,264
The unemployment rate of the census tract that they live in or the prevalence of diabetes at the level of the zip code that they live in.

66
00:07:34,264 --> 00:07:40,264
These would all be ecological or otherwise referred to here as group level or even

67
00:07:40,264 --> 00:07:44,264
area level variables that we may assigned to individuals that we have in their study,

68
00:07:44,264 --> 00:07:54,264
because we think that these kind of group level or ecological measures actually have some meaning for individual people and their health outcomes.

69
00:07:54,264 --> 00:08:00,264
So this is, again, an individual level analysis using ecologic data.

70
00:08:00,264 --> 00:08:06,264
The next type is a completely ecologic analysis, where all variables, including the exposure,

71
00:08:06,264 --> 00:08:12,264
outcome and covariates are true ecological measures that are measured at the level of the group.

72
00:08:12,264 --> 00:08:14,264
And so the slide that I showed you previously,

73
00:08:14,264 --> 00:08:25,264
looking at the mean dietary fat intake in a given country and the rate of breast cancer mortality in that country is a true ecological analysis.

74
00:08:25,264 --> 00:08:31,264
The unit of analysis, again, is the group. And if you want to think about this through more technical perspective and going back

75
00:08:31,264 --> 00:08:36,264
to thinking about the two by two tables that we learned about a few sessions ago,

76
00:08:36,264 --> 00:08:41,264
what this means when we have true ecological data is that the joint distribution

77
00:08:41,264 --> 00:08:46,264
of any combination of frequencies of the exposure outcome is not known,

78
00:08:46,264 --> 00:08:59,264
only their marginal distributions are known. To put this in an easier way of framing it, what this means is that in the two by two table,

79
00:08:59,264 --> 00:09:08,264
we actually don't know the values of the individual cells, as indicated in the two by two tables on the left in the middle of the figure.

80
00:09:08,264 --> 00:09:12,264
And what we mean by the marginal distribution means the row and column totals.

81
00:09:12,264 --> 00:09:18,264
So we know the overall percentage who are exposed and you have the outcome in the total population.

82
00:09:18,264 --> 00:09:25,264
But we don't know any of the joint distributions of these percentages because we don't know what the values of these variables are.

83
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:34,264
For individuals. We could also do a partially ecologic analysis, which is a slight twist on what I showed you before.

84
00:09:34,264 --> 00:09:38,264
So we might have some information available on some joint distributions.

85
00:09:38,264 --> 00:09:45,264
In other words, we might have some individual level data available that lets us fill out some of the cells in the two by two tables.

86
00:09:45,264 --> 00:09:49,264
But we don't have information available on all variables in each group.

87
00:09:49,264 --> 00:09:56,264
So for some of the key variables of interest in our study, we again have only those row or column totals.

88
00:09:56,264 --> 00:10:02,264
So here we'd be using a mix of real individual level data alongside ecological data.

89
00:10:02,264 --> 00:10:07,264
And then finally, a multi-level analysis in a multi level analysis.

90
00:10:07,264 --> 00:10:10,264
We combine data from two or more levels.

91
00:10:10,264 --> 00:10:19,264
And what this means is we conduct an individual level analysis within each group, followed by an ecological analysis.

92
00:10:19,264 --> 00:10:23,264
So a great example of a multi-level analysis would be a study on the contributions

93
00:10:23,264 --> 00:10:28,264
of individual level income and aerial level poverty on the risk of heart attack.

94
00:10:28,264 --> 00:10:34,264
So these are both individual and aerial level measures of socioeconomic conditions.

95
00:10:34,264 --> 00:10:38,264
We both think they have substantive meaning for the risk of heart attack.

96
00:10:38,264 --> 00:10:48,264
And so we're interested in the exposure at both levels. We will learn more about multi-level analysis in the cluster data session in November.

97
00:10:48,264 --> 00:10:56,264
And finally, levels of inference. And so you may have inferred this from some of the previous slides.

98
00:10:56,264 --> 00:11:04,264
But what we try to do in an ecological study is to make an ecological inference about effects on group rates.

99
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:09,264
And this is in contrast to what we do in a study that uses individual level data,

100
00:11:09,264 --> 00:11:13,264
which is make individual inferences about effects on individual risks.

101
00:11:13,264 --> 00:11:18,264
Sometimes individual inferences are referred to as biological inferences.

102
00:11:18,264 --> 00:11:25,264
And this is really important. So recalling back to the slide with the dietary fat intake and breast cancer mortality,

103
00:11:25,264 --> 00:11:28,264
we would not want to make any individual inferences about that slide.

104
00:11:28,264 --> 00:11:34,264
We can only make ecological inferences about the relationship between dietary fat

105
00:11:34,264 --> 00:11:39,264
intake at the country level and rates of breast cancer mortality at the country level.

106
00:11:39,264 --> 00:11:43,264
A side note here is one thing I haven't talked about is confounding.

107
00:11:43,264 --> 00:11:50,264
If you noticed the countries that had the highest level of heidari dietary fat intake, also where the wealthiest countries.

108
00:11:50,264 --> 00:11:55,264
And so there could be some confounding by economic development of countries.

109
00:11:55,264 --> 00:11:58,264
But that's a side point for now.

110
00:11:58,264 --> 00:12:06,264
And the final thing I want to note here is that the target of the intended causal inference does not always match the level of analysis.

111
00:12:06,264 --> 00:12:14,264
And so, as I've been sort of alluding to, we must be very careful in the language we use and how we interpret ecological data.

112
00:12:14,264 --> 00:12:18,264
So if the desired level of causal inference is individual,

113
00:12:18,264 --> 00:12:26,264
then ecological associations may not accurately reflect that individual level exposure outcome association.

114
00:12:26,264 --> 00:12:32,264
And this is called the ecologic bias, more commonly known as the ecologic fallacy.

115
00:12:32,264 --> 00:12:40,264
So let's return again to the slide, which shows the relationship between mean total dietary fat intake bike at the country

116
00:12:40,264 --> 00:12:46,264
level and the age adjusted breast cancer mortality rate at the country level.

117
00:12:46,264 --> 00:12:51,264
So as I've been alluding to this entire presentation,

118
00:12:51,264 --> 00:12:57,264
it would be very it would be very tempting to conclude that individuals who live in countries with

119
00:12:57,264 --> 00:13:05,264
higher mean total dietary fat intake would be at a higher risk of breast cancer and mortality.

120
00:13:05,264 --> 00:13:13,264
And the reason why this is an ecological fallacy is because we do not know whether those individuals who have high

121
00:13:13,264 --> 00:13:23,264
dietary fat intake are also those same individuals who are at higher risk of mortality within a given country.

122
00:13:23,264 --> 00:13:29,264
So the ecological fallacy is where we make the error of making inferences at the

123
00:13:29,264 --> 00:13:37,264
individual level from data that are collected at the ecological or group level.

124
00:13:37,264 --> 00:13:45,264
We will think about this more and work through additional examples during the Live Zoom lecture.

125
00:13:45,264 --> 00:13:50,264
And more formally - and this is a good and more formal definition to remember -

126
00:13:50,264 --> 00:13:56,264
the ecological fallacy is the bias that may occur because an association between variables on an

127
00:13:56,264 --> 00:14:03,264
aggregate level does not necessarily represent the association that exists at the individual level.

128
00:14:03,264 --> 00:14:10,264
And that's the end of Part Two. The next is Part Three: sampling, analysis and data in cross-sectional and ecological studies,

129
00:14:10,264 --> 00:14:17,143
which we will cover in the Live Zoom lecture on Thursday, September 24th, from 10:30 to twelve o'clock Eastern Time.
