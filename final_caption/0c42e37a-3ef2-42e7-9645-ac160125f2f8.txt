00:00:00,004 --> 00:00:05,004
Welcome to Part One of the session on Measures of Association in which we will learn about and

2
00:00:05,004 --> 00:00:10,004
understand relative and absolute measures of association in epidemiology.

3
00:00:10,004 --> 00:00:16,004
There is a fair bit of content to get through in this session. So this prerecording is a little bit longer

4
00:00:16,004 --> 00:00:21,004
than most. Please be patient. Take a break if you need to, and we'll get through it together.

5
00:00:21,004 --> 00:00:27,004
We will first discuss from a conceptual perspective and in with respect to the terminology use,

6
00:00:27,004 --> 00:00:32,004
we use the difference between measures of association and measures of effect, and then we will talk about

7
00:00:32,004 --> 00:00:37,004
relative and absolute measures of association. So

8
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:42,004
last week, we learned about measures and methods to describe disease occurrence in a single cohort or

9
00:00:42,004 --> 00:00:47,004
population. Namely, measures of prevalence and incidents. But what about when

10
00:00:47,004 --> 00:00:53,004
we want to describe disease occurrence across distinct groups within a cohort or population

11
00:00:53,004 --> 00:00:58,004
such as groups defined by an exposure or treatment? Today, we will learn about the standard

12
00:00:58,004 --> 00:01:03,004
measures of association that are used to describe the relative and absolute risks of disease

13
00:01:03,004 --> 00:01:09,004
outcomes associated with exposures in epidemiology. And you may notice here

14
00:01:09,004 --> 00:01:14,004
that we are moving from using descriptive terminology to talk about descriptive inference

15
00:01:14,004 --> 00:01:19,004
to sort of a more analytic or causal terminology and thinking about associations

16
00:01:19,004 --> 00:01:24,004
and effects. So what is a measure of association

17
00:01:24,004 --> 00:01:30,004
versus a measure of effect? Well, they are basically the same thing, but the differences

18
00:01:30,004 --> 00:01:35,004
in the interpretation we say affect when we are attempting to perform causal

19
00:01:35,004 --> 00:01:40,004
inference. A causal effect implies the degree to which the observed outcome

20
00:01:40,004 --> 00:01:46,004
distribution in the population would change if the exposure were to change in the population.

21
00:01:46,004 --> 00:01:52,004
And we think about this under the counterfactual framework, which we talked about in the previous session

22
00:01:52,004 --> 00:01:57,004
on causality. In contrast, we say assn when we are simply

23
00:01:57,004 --> 00:02:02,004
trying to describe an association which here we could define as the increase in probability

24
00:02:02,004 --> 00:02:07,004
of the outcome associated with the presence of the exposure without necessarily

25
00:02:07,004 --> 00:02:12,004
taking the leap to causal inference from a counterfactual perspective,

26
00:02:12,004 --> 00:02:18,004
saying association is probably a little bit more conservative or cautious than saying effect.

27
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:23,004
We don't necessarily always have effects when we have associations. Associations may be

28
00:02:23,004 --> 00:02:28,004
spurious for a number of reasons, including bias and error, which we'll get into later

29
00:02:28,004 --> 00:02:33,004
in the semester. But throughout the rest of this session, I will mostly refer to measures

30
00:02:33,004 --> 00:02:34,583
of association.

31
00:02:34,591 --> 00:02:40,591
Measures of association. Tell us about the strength and directions of observed associations.

32
00:02:40,591 --> 00:02:46,591
So from a qualitative interpretation, we talk about associations between exposures

33
00:02:46,591 --> 00:02:51,591
and outcomes as being strong or weak. And we talk about exposure as as being

34
00:02:51,591 --> 00:02:56,591
risk factors for outcomes, which we would be ones that increase the risk rate or prevalence

35
00:02:56,591 --> 00:03:01,591
of the outcome or protective factors, which would be ones that decrease the risk rate

36
00:03:01,591 --> 00:03:07,591
or prevalence of the outcome. With respect to relative measures, we have

37
00:03:07,591 --> 00:03:12,591
the risk ratio, which is also known as the relative risk. And it's extensions which include

38
00:03:12,591 --> 00:03:18,591
the cumulative incidence ratio or CIR the incidence density ratio or IDR.

39
00:03:18,591 --> 00:03:23,591
The prevalence ratio and the odds ratio. With respect to absolute measures, we

40
00:03:23,591 --> 00:03:29,591
have the risk difference or RD and other difference measures which can be viewed as extensions

41
00:03:29,591 --> 00:03:35,591
to the risk difference. Let's start with relative measures.

42
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:40,591
The risk ratio or relative risk is simply calculated as the risk of incident events

43
00:03:40,591 --> 00:03:46,591
or outcomes in the exposed group divided by the risk of incident events or outcomes

44
00:03:46,591 --> 00:03:51,591
in the unexposed group. And we can readily see that this is a ratio measure.

45
00:03:51,591 --> 00:03:56,591
Please note here that I will use the subscript one when indicating risks in

46
00:03:56,591 --> 00:04:02,591
the exposed groups and the subscript zero or not. When indicating risks

47
00:04:02,591 --> 00:04:08,591
in the unexposed group. So all other relative ratio measures

48
00:04:08,591 --> 00:04:13,591
use this basic formula, and this is why I say they are extensions to the risk ratio.

49
00:04:13,591 --> 00:04:18,591
So let's go through them and brief. The cumulative incidence ratio is

50
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:23,591
used when we have count data on incidents and no person time is available. So

51
00:04:23,591 --> 00:04:28,591
recall from the previous session on measures of disease that the cumulative incidence, which

52
00:04:28,591 --> 00:04:33,591
is the same thing as the incidence proportion, equals the number of incident cases

53
00:04:33,591 --> 00:04:38,591
divided by the disease free persons at T zero. This simplifies to

54
00:04:38,591 --> 00:04:44,591
I over N. The cumulative incidence ratio then

55
00:04:44,591 --> 00:04:49,591
is the ratio of the cumulative incidence in the exposed group to the cumulative

56
00:04:49,591 --> 00:04:56,591
incidence in the unexposed group, as indicated in the bottom formula on this slide.

57
00:04:56,591 --> 00:05:02,591
The incidence density ratio is also referred to as the incidence rate ratio.

58
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:07,591
And we simply take the incidence density in the exposed group divided by

59
00:05:07,591 --> 00:05:12,591
the incidence density in the exposed group.

60
00:05:12,591 --> 00:05:18,591
My apologies. There is an error on the slide. The green bubble should say the incidence density

61
00:05:18,591 --> 00:05:25,591
in the unexposed group. I will correct this in the slides uploaded to Canvas.

62
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:30,591
The prevalence ratio, just like all of the previous ratio measures we have seen, is

63
00:05:30,591 --> 00:05:35,591
simply defined as the prevalence of the outcome in the exposed group, which is P one

64
00:05:35,591 --> 00:05:41,591
divided by the prevalence of the outcome in the unexposed group, which is P zero,

65
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:46,591
and recalling the relationship between incidence, prevalence and duration. Please note that the prevalence

66
00:05:46,591 --> 00:05:51,591
ratio is influenced by the incidence in the exposed and unexposed groups, as

67
00:05:51,591 --> 00:05:56,591
well as the duration of the disease in these two groups. And

68
00:05:56,591 --> 00:06:01,591
finally, the odds ratio. I'll note here that we will elaborate more on odds

69
00:06:01,591 --> 00:06:06,591
ratios in this session on case control studies. So don't worry too much if this doesn't make

70
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:11,591
a lot of sense right now. Recall from the session on measures

71
00:06:11,591 --> 00:06:16,591
of disease that odds have that odds do not include

72
00:06:16,591 --> 00:06:21,591
the numerator within the denominator. Specifically, odds can be defined as the number of people

73
00:06:21,591 --> 00:06:27,591
with the outcome or p divided by the number of people with out the outcome, which is one minus

74
00:06:27,591 --> 00:06:32,591
P. So the odds simplify to P over one minus P where P

75
00:06:32,591 --> 00:06:37,591
represents the incidence proportion or the prevalence proportion. And the odds

76
00:06:37,591 --> 00:06:42,591
ratio is simply the odds in the exposed group divided by the odds in the unexposed

77
00:06:42,591 --> 00:06:49,591
group. We will elaborate on this later again in the session on case control studies.

78
00:06:49,591 --> 00:06:55,591
How do we interpret ratio measures? Well, it's easiest to learn about this by starting

79
00:06:55,591 --> 00:07:00,591
with the null association. The null association is when we observe

80
00:07:00,591 --> 00:07:05,591
a ratio measure of one 1.0. I'm going to refer to RRs

81
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:10,591
here. But please note that the interpretation applies to all of the different ratio

82
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:16,591
measures, whether it's a risk ratio, rate ratio, prevalence ratio, or odds ratio.

83
00:07:16,591 --> 00:07:22,591
So if we have equal values in the numerator and denominator of a ratio measure, we will get

84
00:07:22,591 --> 00:07:27,591
a ratio of one. And we would interpret this as the risk if it is

85
00:07:27,591 --> 00:07:32,591
a risk ratio of the disease in the exposed being equal to the risk of the

86
00:07:32,591 --> 00:07:37,591
disease and the unexposed or no. There is no association between the exposure and

87
00:07:37,591 --> 00:07:42,591
the outcome. When a risk ratio or other ratio

88
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:49,591
measure is greater than one, we interpret this as being in the risk direction.

89
00:07:49,591 --> 00:07:54,591
So in other words, if we observe a risk ratio of two, we would interpret the

90
00:07:54,591 --> 00:07:59,591
risk of disease in the exposed being two times the risk and the unexposed.

91
00:07:59,591 --> 00:08:04,591
So this means that there is greater risk of the outcome associated with the exposure,

92
00:08:04,591 --> 00:08:10,591
when we observe a ratio measure such as a risk ratio greater than one.

93
00:08:10,591 --> 00:08:15,591
When we observe a ratio measure below one, we say it is in the protective direction.

94
00:08:15,591 --> 00:08:20,591
So, for example, if we observe a risk ratio of 0.5, then

95
00:08:20,591 --> 00:08:25,591
we interpret the risk of the disease in the exposed group being 0.5 times,

96
00:08:25,591 --> 00:08:30,591
or, half the risk of the disease in the unexposed group. We say

97
00:08:30,591 --> 00:08:35,591
then that that particular exposure in question is a protective factor, whereas

98
00:08:35,591 --> 00:08:41,591
in contrast, if we observed a risk ratio or other ratio measure in the risk direction,

99
00:08:41,591 --> 00:08:46,591
we would say it is a risk factor. And then please note that the range of a

100
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:51,591
ratio measure goes from zero to infinity. So in the protective direction, it is bounded by zero

101
00:08:51,591 --> 00:08:57,591
at the lower end. And then the risk direction, it can go to infinity.

102
00:08:57,591 --> 00:09:02,591
And as I implied in the previous slide, the exact meaning of a ratio measure depends on the

103
00:09:02,591 --> 00:09:08,591
measure of disease being used, whether it is a risk prevalence rate, sorry, a risk rate

104
00:09:08,591 --> 00:09:13,591
prevalence or odds. So let's really quickly work through an example to get a better idea of

105
00:09:13,591 --> 00:09:18,591
this. So suppose we are interested in the association between lung cancer and smoking.

106
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:23,591
A ratio measure value of 8.0 would vary in interpretation depending on the

107
00:09:23,591 --> 00:09:28,591
measure. So for a cumulative incidence ratio over a five year period,

108
00:09:28,591 --> 00:09:34,591
we would say that a smoker is eight times more likely to develop lung cancer in that five year period

109
00:09:34,591 --> 00:09:40,591
than a nonsmoker, conditional on not first dying of any other disease during that five year period.

110
00:09:40,591 --> 00:09:45,591
And recall that with cumulative incidence, we assume that we have complete follow up on all individuals

111
00:09:45,591 --> 00:09:50,591
in our population. We don't account for withdrawal. So, we have to make the statement that the cumulative

112
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:55,591
incidence ratio would be conditional on remaining in the population.

113
00:09:55,591 --> 00:10:01,591
In contrast, for an incidence density ratio, we would say that smokers have eight times the rate of developing

114
00:10:01,591 --> 00:10:06,591
lung cancer compared to nonsmokers over a five year period. And we can say this

115
00:10:06,591 --> 00:10:11,591
because we incorporate person time in the incidence density ratio. So we know how much time

116
00:10:11,591 --> 00:10:16,591
at risk was contributed by all members of the population.

117
00:10:16,591 --> 00:10:21,591
And as a final example, if we have a prevalence ratio, we would say a smoker is eight times

118
00:10:21,591 --> 00:10:29,591
more likely to have lung cancer than a nonsmoker at a specified point or period in time.

119
00:10:29,591 --> 00:10:34,591
Let's move on to absolute measures now. There are generally two

120
00:10:34,591 --> 00:10:39,591
various classes of absolute measures of association. The first is risk

121
00:10:39,591 --> 00:10:44,591
difference measures. So the basic risk difference. And then it's extension is the incidence density

122
00:10:44,591 --> 00:10:52,591
difference, mortality rate difference and prevalence difference. And then the attributable risk measures.

123
00:10:52,591 --> 00:10:58,591
And before moving on, I will note here that if the exposure is truly causal

124
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:03,591
than an absolute measure of association is also called an impact measure.

125
00:11:03,591 --> 00:11:09,591
And I just want to note that the terms, absolute measure and impact measure are often used interchangeably.

126
00:11:09,591 --> 00:11:14,591
However, they are not truly interchangeable. And whether we want to use the phrase impact

127
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:19,591
measure depends on if we are comfortable with making a causal interpretation about the absolute

128
00:11:19,591 --> 00:11:24,591
measure that we have observed.

129
00:11:24,591 --> 00:11:29,591
The risk difference is simply the risk in the exposed groups group or are

130
00:11:29,591 --> 00:11:35,591
one minus the risk in the unexposed group or are not the risk difference

131
00:11:35,591 --> 00:11:42,591
is dimensionless. And this is because risk is a proportion. And it ranges from negative one to one.

132
00:11:42,591 --> 00:11:47,591
The incidence density difference. Analogously is simply the incidence density in the exposed

133
00:11:47,591 --> 00:11:52,591
group, minus the incidence density in the unexposed group. This is also called the incidence

134
00:11:52,591 --> 00:11:57,591
rate difference. The incidence density difference has dimensions

135
00:11:57,591 --> 00:12:02,591
or units of one over time, recalling that the denominator of incidence density is

136
00:12:02,591 --> 00:12:09,591
person time and it can vary in its range from negative infinity to infinity.

137
00:12:09,591 --> 00:12:14,591
The mortality rate difference is the exact same as the incidence density difference,

138
00:12:14,591 --> 00:12:22,591
except for we are using mortality rather than incidence.

139
00:12:22,591 --> 00:12:27,591
And the prevalence difference finally is simply the prevalence in the exposed

140
00:12:27,591 --> 00:12:32,591
group, or P1, minus the prevalence and the unexposed group, or P naught.

141
00:12:32,591 --> 00:12:42,591
And similar to the risk difference, the prevalence difference is dimensionless because prevalence is a proportion.

142
00:12:42,591 --> 00:12:48,591
Let's move on to absolute measures of association attributable risk measures.

143
00:12:48,591 --> 00:12:53,591
The attributable risk or AR is the difference in risk in the exposed group,

144
00:12:53,591 --> 00:12:59,591
or R1, minus the risk in the unexposed group, or R naught.

145
00:12:59,591 --> 00:13:04,591
You may note this is the exact same formula as the risk difference, and that is because the attributable risk is

146
00:13:04,591 --> 00:13:09,591
simply a causal interpretation of the risk difference. And here R

147
00:13:09,591 --> 00:13:14,591
or risk can either be a true risk, meaning the cumulative incidence or incidence proportion,

148
00:13:14,591 --> 00:13:20,591
or a rate such as the incidence density. And I want to make a note here that

149
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:25,591
because incidence must be calculated in order to obtain the attributable risk. We cannot

150
00:13:25,591 --> 00:13:30,591
usually calculate the attributable risk from case control studies. And this is because case

151
00:13:30,591 --> 00:13:35,591
control studies sample on the basis of the outcome, not the exposure.

152
00:13:35,591 --> 00:13:41,591
And if this doesn't make sense right now, don't worry. We will get into this in the case control studies section.

153
00:13:41,591 --> 00:13:46,591
But just make note of this for later, because it is useful to think about the connection between attributable

154
00:13:46,591 --> 00:13:52,591
risk and whether we can estimate it or not using case control data.

155
00:13:52,591 --> 00:13:57,591
This slide shows a really nice visualization and conceptualizing attributable risk.

156
00:13:57,591 --> 00:14:03,591
So in Panel A, we have level of risk on the Y axis. And then we have it in the exposed

157
00:14:03,591 --> 00:14:08,591
group on the left and the non exposed group on the right. And we can see that risk is higher in the exposed group

158
00:14:08,591 --> 00:14:13,591
than in the non exposed group. And Panel B, we actually now separate

159
00:14:13,591 --> 00:14:19,591
out the level of risk to the background risk, which is where we have the map,

160
00:14:19,591 --> 00:14:24,591
which is defined by the level of risk in the non exposed group. And this is useful

161
00:14:24,591 --> 00:14:29,591
to think about because we will usually see cases of the disease outcome among the non

162
00:14:29,591 --> 00:14:34,591
exposed group. So it is useful to define the excess risk that occurs

163
00:14:34,591 --> 00:14:41,591
in the exposed group with reference to the level of risk that occurs in the non exposed group.

164
00:14:41,591 --> 00:14:46,591
And then in Panel C, if we want to make a causal interpretation, we can say that the excess

165
00:14:46,591 --> 00:14:54,591
risk that occurs in the exposed group could be attributable to or due to the exposure.

166
00:14:54,591 --> 00:14:59,591
We can then move on to calculate the attributable risk percent, which is simply the attributable

167
00:14:59,591 --> 00:15:05,591
risk or risk difference divided by the risk in the exposed group multiplied

168
00:15:05,591 --> 00:15:10,591
by 100 percent. And mathematically, this is the same as taking the relative risk, minus

169
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:15,591
one divided by the relative risk multiplied by one hundred percent. The attributable risk

170
00:15:15,591 --> 00:15:20,591
present is also referred to as the attributable fraction. And it answers the public health question.

171
00:15:20,591 --> 00:15:26,591
What percentage of the disease in the exposed group can we hope to prevent? If we are able to eliminate exposure

172
00:15:26,591 --> 00:15:31,591
to the agent in question? Now, let's move on to the concept

173
00:15:31,591 --> 00:15:36,591
of population attributable risk or PAR. The PAR is the attributable

174
00:15:36,591 --> 00:15:42,591
risk for the entire population. So in other words, the amount of disease in the population

175
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:47,591
that can be attributed to that factor or exposure. We calculate the PAR

176
00:15:47,591 --> 00:15:52,591
as the risk in the total population, minus the risk in the unexposed. Which is equivalent

177
00:15:52,591 --> 00:15:58,591
to the attributable risk multiplied by the proportion of the population exposed, or P1.

178
00:15:58,591 --> 00:16:03,591
And the PR answers the public health question, how many cases

179
00:16:03,591 --> 00:16:08,591
of disease and the total population? Can we hope to prevent if we are able to eliminate the exposure

180
00:16:08,591 --> 00:16:13,591
in question? A couple of notes about the PAR. It

181
00:16:13,591 --> 00:16:18,591
is never larger than the attributable risk. And if the exposure is causal or believed

182
00:16:18,591 --> 00:16:23,591
to be causal, then the PAR is a measure of the impact of the exposure on the population's health, which is a

183
00:16:23,591 --> 00:16:29,591
really useful public health measure. And finally, the PAR percent

184
00:16:29,591 --> 00:16:35,591
is analogous to the AR or attributable risk percent. It is the attributable risk for the entire population.

185
00:16:35,591 --> 00:16:40,591
And we simply take the risk in the total population, minus the risk and the unexposed,

186
00:16:40,591 --> 00:16:45,591
divided by the risk and the total population times one hundred percent. And it answers the public health

187
00:16:45,591 --> 00:16:50,591
question. What percentage of the disease in the population can we hope to prevent? If we are able to

188
00:16:50,591 --> 00:16:56,591
eliminate the exposure in question again, another really useful public health measure.

189
00:16:56,591 --> 00:17:02,591
So what's the major difference between the attributable risk and the population attributable risk?

190
00:17:02,591 --> 00:17:08,591
The AR represents the excess risk in the exposed population, whereas the PAR

191
00:17:08,591 --> 00:17:13,591
represents the effect of the exposure in the entire population, which encompasses both exposed

192
00:17:13,591 --> 00:17:18,591
and unexposed individuals. And the slide shows a really nice visualization

193
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:23,591
of it here. We can see that the population attributable risk

194
00:17:23,591 --> 00:17:29,591
actually varies for a given attributable risk among the exposed population,

195
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:35,591
depending on the size of the unexposed and exposed populations.

196
00:17:35,591 --> 00:17:41,591
This slide and the following few slides show some really nice terminology in defining

197
00:17:41,591 --> 00:17:46,591
and interpreting, interpreting attributable risk and attributable risk present measures. I'm not going

198
00:17:46,591 --> 00:17:51,591
to read them out loud because I don't think that's a good use of our time. But I will note that these slides are uploaded

199
00:17:51,591 --> 00:17:56,591
to Canvas and so you can download these slides and keep them on reference for when you are studying

200
00:17:56,591 --> 00:18:01,591
and completing the in class activities. So I'm going to skip through them now, but I just want to make them available

201
00:18:01,591 --> 00:18:07,591
to you. And that's the end of Part One.

202
00:18:07,591 --> 00:18:13,000
The next is Part 2, examples of calculating relative and absolute measures of association.
