1
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:12,420
Welcome back to Nutrition 590.

2
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,100
Do you remember when you first

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,170
heard of the Human
Genome Project?

4
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,635
This was built as the
holy grail to help

5
00:00:18,635 --> 00:00:21,280
identify the source
of all human disease.

6
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:25,105
Billions of dollars went into
the Human Genome Project.

7
00:00:25,105 --> 00:00:28,730
But without the corresponding
Human Epigenome Project,

8
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:29,840
and it's only getting

9
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,495
a fraction of what the
Genome Project received,

10
00:00:32,495 --> 00:00:34,370
we're really only evaluating

11
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:36,385
the hard drive half
of the picture.

12
00:00:36,385 --> 00:00:38,465
We're not studying and improving

13
00:00:38,465 --> 00:00:40,580
the epigenomic software like

14
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,355
DNA methylation and
histone modifications

15
00:00:43,355 --> 00:00:47,260
that can put all of the
genomic knowledge to work.

16
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:50,270
The first learning
objective of this module

17
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:52,790
is to understand the
historical advances

18
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:54,830
of genetics and genomics in

19
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:58,270
the context of the emerging
field of epigenetics.

20
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:00,120
Finally, we will describe

21
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,270
modern day reasons
why incorporating

22
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,835
epigenetics and a
public health practice

23
00:01:04,835 --> 00:01:06,985
is so very important.

24
00:01:06,985 --> 00:01:12,395
To begin, I want take us
back about 150 years when

25
00:01:12,395 --> 00:01:14,420
the field of genetics was

26
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:18,095
founded by Gregor Mendel
and the pea plants.

27
00:01:18,095 --> 00:01:20,780
It took another 70 years for

28
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,050
the epigenome to
enter this timeline,

29
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:25,190
and that's when Conrad
Waddington first

30
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:29,155
described the term
epigenetics in 1942.

31
00:01:29,155 --> 00:01:31,555
What's really
surprising about this,

32
00:01:31,555 --> 00:01:35,420
is that was more than 10
years before the debut of

33
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,820
the DNA double helix
on the cover of

34
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:40,540
Nature in April 1953.

35
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,530
After that, it took

36
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:46,190
another two decades for
us to understand that

37
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:48,890
histone modifications
in DNA methylation

38
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:52,205
were important instruction
books for the genome.

39
00:01:52,205 --> 00:01:56,375
First, in 1964, we
began to associate

40
00:01:56,375 --> 00:02:00,880
histone acetylation with
inducing gene transcription.

41
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,450
Then in the 1970s,

42
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,670
it was proposed by
Robin Holliday and

43
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:09,000
John Pugh and independently
by Arthur Riggs

44
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,920
that 5-methylcytosine has
an important contribution

45
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,205
to controlling gene activity.

46
00:02:15,205 --> 00:02:18,605
It was proposed that the
pattern of DNA methylation

47
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:22,190
on cytosines could be inherited
through cell division.

48
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:24,500
But in 1975, there was still

49
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,215
no direct evidence
for this proposal.

50
00:02:27,215 --> 00:02:29,390
It was in the 1980s that

51
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:32,165
a number of epigenetic
discoveries were made.

52
00:02:32,165 --> 00:02:36,290
First, we knew through the
work of Surani and colleagues

53
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:39,394
that the role of the maternal
and paternal genomes

54
00:02:39,394 --> 00:02:40,670
are not equivalent.

55
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:44,090
In fact, you need one copy of
a paternal and one copy of

56
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:48,720
a maternal genome for
developing individual to occur.

57
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,060
In the late 1980s,

58
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,460
the first DNA methyltransferase,

59
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:56,570
DNMT1 was cloned and
we understood that

60
00:02:56,570 --> 00:03:00,520
the nucleosome was involved
in genetic regulation.

61
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,510
This was followed
closely in the 1990s

62
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:06,575
and the early 2000s by
the Human Genome Project,

63
00:03:06,575 --> 00:03:09,305
which identified there
are some 20,000 genes.

64
00:03:09,305 --> 00:03:11,900
Remember, at the beginning
of this project,

65
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,100
we thought it was going to be
about 100,000 human genes.

66
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:19,010
But these 20,000 genes are
pretty important and they made

67
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:21,395
the cover of many
exciting science

68
00:03:21,395 --> 00:03:23,119
in popular press magazines,

69
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:25,400
including Time Magazine
declaring that

70
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,450
we had cracked the code in 2003.

71
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:30,630
Also in the 1990s,

72
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:33,330
the first imprinted
genes were identified.

73
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,180
It turns out imprinted genes are

74
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,890
particularly important
for growth and

75
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:40,900
development and are controlled
by epigenetic regulation.

76
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:45,215
In 1992, through the use
of genetic knockout mice,

77
00:03:45,215 --> 00:03:48,395
it was determined that
DNMT1 is essential.

78
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:50,570
If DNMT1 is knocked out,

79
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:52,430
DNA methylation patterns are not

80
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:56,160
established and mice do
not develop properly.

81
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:01,430
In 1995, the chromatin remodeling
complexes were identified.

82
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:04,970
In the 1997, the first
X-ray crystal structure

83
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:08,125
of a nucleosome was published.

84
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:11,030
This was quickly
followed in 1998 by

85
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:13,280
the first evidence that

86
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,030
diet could be linked
to phenotypic changes.

87
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:18,710
In this case, the coat color of

88
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:22,105
a mouse through DNA
hypermethylation.

89
00:04:22,105 --> 00:04:25,340
Throughout the 2000s,
we also learned a

90
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,050
lot more about these
growth-related imprinted genes.

91
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,300
In fact, they're particularly

92
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,095
important in human
cancer development.

93
00:04:32,095 --> 00:04:35,810
In the 2000s, we also
expanded the field of

94
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:37,700
environmental epigenetics to

95
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:40,405
think about
environmental toxicants.

96
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:42,800
This field is credited to some of

97
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,500
the work of Randy Jirtle
and Rob Waterland,

98
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,180
which is shown here
on the cover of

99
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,150
Molecular and Cellular Biology.

100
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:51,170
In this example, they fed

101
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:53,360
mouse mothers diets
that were really

102
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,830
high in methyl donors like

103
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:58,105
folic acid, betaine, vitamin B12.

104
00:04:58,105 --> 00:05:00,140
This resulted in altered

105
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:02,074
DNA methylation in the offspring,

106
00:05:02,074 --> 00:05:04,990
which was particularly
important for their health.

107
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:07,730
Throughout the 2000s, we also saw

108
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:10,040
the development and FDA approval

109
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,195
of certain types of

110
00:05:11,195 --> 00:05:14,900
epigenetic therapies
for things like cancer.

111
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:18,275
This included both
5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine,

112
00:05:18,275 --> 00:05:22,295
as well as TSA, which affects
histone modifications.

113
00:05:22,295 --> 00:05:24,620
Throughout the 2000s, we also

114
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,630
learned that cloned animals,

115
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:27,980
including the famous sheep,

116
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:31,070
Dolly, often did not
develop properly due to

117
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:35,230
altered epigenetic effects,
including DNA methylation.

118
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:38,090
It was finally in 2006 when

119
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:41,380
the Epigenome Project
was first initiated.

120
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:44,330
In 2010, DNA methylation

121
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:47,510
debuted on the cover of Time
Magazine in which you see,

122
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:50,540
"Why your DNA is
not your destiny."

123
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,700
In fact, this was not
the first time that

124
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:56,420
Time Magazine had
reported on epigenetics.

125
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,800
In 2007, Nora Volkow,

126
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,470
which is the Director
of the NIH Institute,

127
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:04,030
NIDA or National
Institute of Drug Abuse,

128
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,890
selected Duke University
scientist who's

129
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:09,620
pioneering work on
epigenetics and genomic

130
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,530
imprinting uncovered
a vast territory

131
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:15,080
in which the gene
represents less of

132
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,300
an inexorable sense and more of

133
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,470
an access point for

134
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:21,010
the environment to
modify the epigenome.

135
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:23,000
The trailblazing discoveries of

136
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,800
Dr. Randy Jirtle have produced

137
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,230
a far more complete and
useful understanding

138
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:29,230
of human development and disease.

139
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:32,240
It was my honor to be working
in Randy Jirtle's lab in

140
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,420
2007 when he received notice
that he'd been nominated.

141
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:38,390
He just came running down
the laboratory hall,

142
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:40,820
and was extremely excited
that Dr. Volkow had

143
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:44,370
recognized him for this
important nomination.

144
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:47,600
In 2009, Time Magazine also

145
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,235
reported on the Human
Epigenome, calling it decoded.

146
00:06:51,235 --> 00:06:53,900
In 2010, more information

147
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,650
on different types of exposures.

148
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:57,680
In this case, how cocaine can

149
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,065
scramble the epigenome
of the brain

150
00:07:00,065 --> 00:07:05,025
or things like childhood trauma
can induce adult obesity,

151
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:08,420
and these could be due to
epigenetic mechanisms.

152
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,640
As we begin to look ahead,

153
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,355
there are a number of
practical challenges

154
00:07:13,355 --> 00:07:16,520
in incorporating epigenetics
into public health.

155
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:20,765
First, we know that
nutrition, chemical,

156
00:07:20,765 --> 00:07:25,210
physical, and social factors
all modify the epigenome.

157
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:28,310
So this means that
looking at things in

158
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:30,260
isolation such as animal models

159
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,120
that only look at
one thing at a time,

160
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,685
may not necessarily
reflect human health.

161
00:07:35,685 --> 00:07:38,510
But at the same time
in human epidemiology,

162
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:39,530
controlling for all of

163
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:42,190
these things is
also quite complex.

164
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:44,540
Second, we know that

165
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,039
the epigenome is particularly

166
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:48,020
vulnerable during developments.

167
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:50,480
This is also a particularly
difficult time to

168
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:54,065
assay for different types
of environmental exposures.

169
00:07:54,065 --> 00:07:56,840
Third, the epigenome is

170
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,570
both tissue and
cell type specific.

171
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:01,640
So therefore, we have to rely on

172
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,280
things like surrogate
DNA from the blood or

173
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,860
saliva to represent tissue types

174
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:09,215
of interests like brain or liver.

175
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:11,720
Fourth, it is
particularly important to

176
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,720
understand that through
epigenetic mechanisms,

177
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,495
there could be non-traditional
dose-response curves,

178
00:08:17,495 --> 00:08:20,480
such that a lower exposure might

179
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,800
change the epigenome in

180
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,355
a different way than
a higher exposure.

181
00:08:24,355 --> 00:08:28,070
Second to last, it's also
important to understand that

182
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:30,170
an epigenetic change does not

183
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:32,635
necessarily reflect
an adverse effect.

184
00:08:32,635 --> 00:08:34,095
It may be neutral,

185
00:08:34,095 --> 00:08:35,490
it may be adaptive.

186
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:37,910
So we have to keep that
in mind when thinking

187
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:41,495
about different environmental
and nutritional exposures.

188
00:08:41,495 --> 00:08:44,045
Last but not least,

189
00:08:44,045 --> 00:08:47,780
the fact that the epigenome
is dynamic in modifiable,

190
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,190
what we call plastic,

191
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:50,420
this may allow for

192
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:53,960
nutritional and pharmacological
interventions to reduce

193
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:57,050
disease risk that may occur from

194
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:59,420
environmental nutritional
exposures that

195
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:02,400
occur early in life.
