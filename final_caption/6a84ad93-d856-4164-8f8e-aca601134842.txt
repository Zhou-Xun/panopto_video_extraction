1
00:00:09,646 --> 00:00:13,067
After watching this video, you will
be able to transpose data to conduct

2
00:00:13,067 --> 00:00:17,040
bivariate analysis for matched data.

3
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,697
First, let's remember our algorithm and

4
00:00:19,697 --> 00:00:23,698
realize that now we're going into
the right part of the figure.

5
00:00:23,698 --> 00:00:27,467
As you can see, the tests used to
analyze matched data are different

6
00:00:27,467 --> 00:00:30,970
than the ones used for non-matched data.

7
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:33,554
But they have an equivalent one for
each situation,

8
00:00:33,554 --> 00:00:38,210
depending on the type of parameters.

9
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:43,940
The sample we're going to use for matched
data is a matched case control study.

10
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:47,765
You're going to use this data for
many of your exercises, so

11
00:00:47,765 --> 00:00:49,790
I'll give more details later.

12
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:54,304
But briefly, in this study,
cases were survivors of a first myocardial

13
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:59,262
infarction, and they were matched to
population based controls by age, sex,

14
00:00:59,262 --> 00:01:00,890
and county of residence.

15
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:03,860
They were matched 1:1,
which means that for

16
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:09,910
every case there is a control with the
same age, sex, and county of residence.

17
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:14,434
Importantly, there is a paired variable
in the data set that identifies

18
00:01:14,434 --> 00:01:19,630
this matching, so every case has
the same matching ID as their control.

19
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:24,351
We are going to analyze the associations
between myocardial infraction and smoking,

20
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:27,130
a categorical variable,
and physical activity,

21
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:31,460
a continuous variable measured in mets or
metabolic equivalents.

22
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:35,986
Our hypotheses are kind of obvious, since
these are well known risk factors for MI.

23
00:01:35,986 --> 00:01:40,056
We hypothesize that smoking is going to
be positively associated with MI, and

24
00:01:40,056 --> 00:01:46,110
physical activity is going to
be inversely associated with MI.

25
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,855
As opposed to where we
don't have much data,

26
00:01:48,855 --> 00:01:51,685
that we did not have to
do any data management.

27
00:01:51,685 --> 00:01:56,274
The first thing we have to do now is to
transpose our data because most likely it

28
00:01:56,274 --> 00:01:58,780
won't come transposed.

29
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:04,033
Our data would likely come as shown
in the rectangle named Temp.mi.

30
00:02:04,033 --> 00:02:06,347
This is the temp.mi data set.

31
00:02:06,347 --> 00:02:10,275
You will have one observation for
each individual,

32
00:02:10,275 --> 00:02:13,310
either be in a case or a control.

33
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:18,023
And what you really want to get is
the data in the format called pair.

34
00:02:18,023 --> 00:02:22,700
That is,
you want to have one observation per pair.

35
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:26,981
Every observation, then, will have
information for the case and the control.

36
00:02:26,981 --> 00:02:31,617
Which means that you will have to have two
variables for every original variable,

37
00:02:31,617 --> 00:02:34,740
one for the case and one for the control.

38
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:38,600
In this example, or
original variable is smoking.

39
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,305
And we need to create two variables,
the one for

40
00:02:41,305 --> 00:02:47,040
the case we'll still call it Smoking, and
the one for the control will be Smoking2.

41
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,030
Clearly you can call them with different
names, but we are doing it this way.

42
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:54,980
Now the steps to do that in
SAS are shown on the left.

43
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:59,483
There are more elegant ways of doing this
and there is even a prog that can do that,

44
00:02:59,483 --> 00:03:03,523
but this is a simple way that will allow
you to do what you want to do without

45
00:03:03,523 --> 00:03:05,600
learning your code.

46
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,603
The three steps that you have to do are,

47
00:03:08,603 --> 00:03:13,730
first separate cases and
controls in two new datasets.

48
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:16,759
Second, in one of those,
it can be the controls for

49
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:19,018
example, you rename the variables.

50
00:03:19,018 --> 00:03:23,220
Here we have renaming,
smoking as smoking2.

51
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:28,161
And third, finally, we will merge
the data set by the matching variable.

52
00:03:28,161 --> 00:03:31,027
So going one by one,
we create a data set for

53
00:03:31,027 --> 00:03:36,047
the controls of setting from the original
data set using the if statement.

54
00:03:36,047 --> 00:03:41,030
If MI=0 means that we will
keep only the controls.

55
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:45,900
And here we also have renamed the variable
smoking and call it smoking2.

56
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:50,528
Second, we do the same for the cases
with a set from the original data set

57
00:03:50,528 --> 00:03:55,500
using the if MI=1 statement,
which will keep only the cases.

58
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,963
Now that we have these two pieces apart,

59
00:03:57,963 --> 00:04:01,513
we are going to merge them
again by the matching variable.

60
00:04:01,513 --> 00:04:05,374
Remember that every time you want
to use a bias statement in SAS,

61
00:04:05,374 --> 00:04:07,746
you will need to sort by that valuable.

62
00:04:07,746 --> 00:04:10,718
We sort both datasets by
the matching variable.

63
00:04:10,718 --> 00:04:14,703
And finally we're going to merge
them by the matching variable.

64
00:04:14,703 --> 00:04:17,690
This is the code to match
datasets by a variable.

65
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:22,451
If we follow that code, we will end up
with a data set called paired that has one

66
00:04:22,451 --> 00:04:27,400
observation per matching
pair as we wanted.

67
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,962
So In summary, in this video will learned
how to transpose data to conduct bivariate

68
00:04:31,962 --> 00:04:33,519
analysis for matched data.

69
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:36,928
In the next video we
will start the analysis.
