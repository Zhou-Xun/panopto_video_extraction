1
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:28,310
Welcome to the first official day of fall with the weather.

2
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:35,140
Kind of feels good today may not feel so good and you know five months from now we're actually this different.

3
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:40,870
We feel great. Five months from now, I'm sure. So, yes.

4
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:46,690
So this is our last section like class session, specifically about infants and infancy.

5
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:57,459
And the baby's paper is due next week, so I'll hopefully not be too redundant,

6
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:12,320
but just sort of sum up some key things around infancy and interventions that we think about infancy out here and really listen to

7
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:22,690
a little bit and love to hear from you guys your thoughts on those kind of different approaches to intervention and strengths,

8
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:25,270
drawbacks, ways to make them better,

9
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:39,940
and ways we might again kind of move your agenda forward in a public health facing way that is inclusive and responsive and engaging to parents.

10
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:44,710
So with that said, I want to say anything else.

11
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,600
Yeah. So let me know if you guys have any question on the baby paper.

12
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:56,499
I started looking at the read response and not quite through them, but I think people make great comments, so please comments, awesome class.

13
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:05,290
And then I am also kind of midway through the paper topics too, so thank you for submitting those.

14
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:09,280
And yeah, right. Like I said, if I have feedback, I'll get some.

15
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:18,070
Okay. And I do have I have one appointment during the office hours, but I am around later and I don't know,

16
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,650
I wanted to say that I don't know if anybody has tried to come in on Thursday afternoons,

17
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:29,590
but I'm in the Prevention Research Center suite and sometimes up till now the doors

18
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:33,909
have been locked and we're trying to work on a system to have them be unlocked.

19
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:39,129
But it's still kind of a only people who are like working in the suite tend to go in there.

20
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:43,510
But my office is in there for like historical reasons. I just started there and I kind of like it in there.

21
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:50,799
So if for some reason people are like trying to come and get me like either bang on the door or just send me an email.

22
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,580
So like I'm waiting outside, but hopefully the door will be open.

23
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:59,890
So that's just, I wanted to make sure to mention that this is like changing systems in process.

24
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,860
Okay. So I will I can try to talk louder.

25
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:19,129
So in terms of the mini lecture, it really I know I kind of went through some things we've talked about a lot before,

26
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:29,060
which and I harp on these because they're important, but sort of the tone and attachments and kind of clicks through a few different

27
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:34,550
models of kind of parenting interventions in this early phase of development.

28
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:40,279
Of course, one of the reasons that we are focused on this early stage now and parenting

29
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:45,050
is that that is an intervention like context that matches where infants are.

30
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:50,959
Right. So infants are kind of existing in some different settings with their parents and working directly with parents more.

31
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:55,580
Talking about infant development while being interventions make sense.

32
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:03,350
But we also I don't want to neglect talking about early child care providers because that's also an important caregiver relationship,

33
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:14,720
as we've talked about. That sort of broadly, really broad summary intervention did anything at the start of the mini lecture.

34
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:17,300
Anyone have any thoughts or comments on that?

35
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:24,680
Those different models or ideas and just I sort of put the pictures up here kind of to remind me also of the kind of

36
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:30,820
different modalities of intervention and different types of interventions that this is that like one stops up pediatrics,

37
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,540
this is the manpower model,

38
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:38,419
which is really like a therapeutic intervention that's delivered, developed here in Michigan, delivered in like clinic settings,

39
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:45,560
in psychiatry, community settings, lots of different sort of places that it's place this is that find interventions.

40
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:49,580
This is sort of like what I think of as a sort of standard parent parenting

41
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:54,350
group like come to a room and a big group of people and sort of talk and share.

42
00:04:54,620 --> 00:05:04,790
And then this is a home visiting model. So lots of different ways to reach parents, different, you know, there's pros and cons of each one.

43
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:14,540
So I think when I especially if people are interested in this like age period or working with parents, how do we make these better?

44
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:17,600
How do we make these reach more people and be more like palatable?

45
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:26,310
Okay. But it is not so which we'll talk about a little bit is like there are a few sort of like app based interventions around this.

46
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:30,840
So I'll pull up one example, an early relational hub with the type.

47
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:38,010
So again, you guys have seen, I think, this picture before and this is that picture that this point,

48
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:43,650
like if you had to talk to a parent to say, like, why is this certain return stuff important?

49
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,310
It's really these key things.

50
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:54,780
So it lays the groundwork for sort of all of our ability to have executive function skills like processing, planning, concentration,

51
00:05:54,780 --> 00:06:02,420
attention, and then also regulate our emotions so we can recognize this is sort of the attachment function to that emotion regulation.

52
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:06,420
So both of those things are really important and develop in these serve and return relationships.

53
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:11,130
And then another sort of way to think about this process,

54
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:18,479
just really basic developmental science stuff is like when infants are tiny, they are not able to do many of these things.

55
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:22,200
Like they sort of are learning to like regulate their temperature a little bit and

56
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:27,780
begin to regulate their crying and their elimination rate peeping and pooping.

57
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,569
But this is all co regulated with a caregiver like really intensely.

58
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:46,469
We talked last time about breastfeeding. That's like part of this, you know, bonding process that becomes like a co regulatory state.

59
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:53,280
So those of us in this field talk a lot about like Dyadic Co regulation and that's like that early, early infancy.

60
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:59,009
And so we know and I'm sure also I do. So again, there's that transactional process between infant and caregiver,

61
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:04,830
but it's really regulation and emotion regulation at the beginning is like really intertwined with the caregiver.

62
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:15,810
Over time, the child sort of internalizes those regulatory processes, skills, orientations, and it becomes more of a self regulation.

63
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:24,320
By the child. It sort of like lives a little more within the child.

64
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:28,350
I would say the child is still self-regulating with regard to their context.

65
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:32,299
We'll talk a lot more about self-regulation in early childhood because that's

66
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,840
sort of the when a lot of people talk about self-regulation in preschoolers.

67
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:43,640
But this ambition is really important. And that's why we're sort of really trying to highlight work with parents.

68
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:54,590
And then this intervention goal, like the original stuff, is that this really can help to rebuild brain circuitry or build brain circuitry,

69
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:58,840
build connections if it's developing and supportive relationships.

70
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:05,629
And so it's the sort of we're looking to the relationship factors to really do these sort of wiring,

71
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:08,510
hardcore basic developmental firings of the brain.

72
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:17,720
And I always like to highlight that they sort of function to help us manage stress for infants as well as parents.

73
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,930
So that should feel familiar.

74
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:27,860
And like I would say, those are sort of core messages to talk with parents about if you guys have the opportunity to do so,

75
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:32,510
like why on earth would I engage in a parenting program and why would I take extra time to do this kind of stuff?

76
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:40,550
Another thing about the early parenting context that we were touching a little bit on last time,

77
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:46,730
and some people noted in their comments, which was great, this idea of the intergenerational transmission.

78
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:52,309
So we talked a bit last time about aces and trauma and like what you have in your history and how

79
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:58,790
it might be triggered by this like close bonding or sort of close physical contact with an infant.

80
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:03,680
And this sort of realization like, oh my goodness, I am responsible for this infant.

81
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:09,950
I'm, you know, having to take care of this infant. How are my own parenting relationship?

82
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:17,930
Schemas and thoughts, conscious thoughts or subconscious awareness going to affect my parenting?

83
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:23,450
And so sometimes, you know, we know from sort of lots of research and psychology and trauma that,

84
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:30,290
you know, we're often fried, like we're influenced by our subconscious.

85
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:37,010
We may not be aware. And so one strategy often in different therapies and a lot of these different interventions are say, hey,

86
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:43,460
let's talk about it and become aware because these things can be influencing our behavior even if we don't think they are.

87
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:51,349
And it doesn't mean that, like every parent needs to go to psychotherapy for like, you know, that's not what I'm talking about.

88
00:09:51,350 --> 00:10:00,110
It's more just kind of awareness raising. Like when you have, you know, a young infant that you're all of a sudden responsible for these kind of.

89
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:06,430
Reactions around your own parenting experiences can shape how how you behave.

90
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:12,200
And if you think about we haven't talked so much about it, but.

91
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:23,239
Giving birth to an infant is having a lot of like biological change and readjustment and hormonal flooding and all kinds of things going on,

92
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:30,320
pain, lack of sleep, lots of different sort of just basic challenges to existing as a human.

93
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:37,190
And you have to care for this other little human. And so there's just a lot of stuff going on and people sort of maybe,

94
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:43,610
maybe not at their best and kind of don't realize that things are happening, that you're sort of transmitting potentially.

95
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:52,130
So it's that sort of early parenting transition. And then this relates also to last time,

96
00:10:52,760 --> 00:11:03,620
but one of the focus areas of some of but not all of these interventions is that they're sort of bringing in awareness again.

97
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:11,260
Like we can't change the past. Like, maybe you didn't feel like you had great parenting, or maybe you had stressful early life experiences.

98
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:21,610
But we can change kind of how you think about those and also how you kind of move forward as a parent so we can sort of reshape or re, you know,

99
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:25,839
frame the kinds of things you experienced and sort of think about how that

100
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:30,220
might work in your new relationship that you're creating with this new infant.

101
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:41,969
So I think it's really important to keep in mind, like with health setting in or not in parenting intervention, delivery setting, you know,

102
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:45,450
the time when you're going to see parents a lot, these things are still important,

103
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:49,680
but we kind of have to balance like how much time we have with the parent,

104
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:58,740
how much relationship we might build with a parent and, you know, bringing this stuff up because sometimes when you bring some of the stuff up,

105
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:01,740
it can be challenging to a parent, can be emotionally distressing to a parent.

106
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:11,219
And so you kind of have to think about, you know, a balance between building this awareness that this happens for all parents and what's

107
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:15,750
happening with you right now and what kind of stress are you feeling and how can we help you?

108
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:21,070
Back to our screening conversation, hopefully help you manage that and give you resources to manage that.

109
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:28,890
So I bring these up as important constructs to be aware of in all of these programs, but also, you know.

110
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:34,060
Most people in this room are not going to go out and be like therapists.

111
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:38,650
But. Just like amazing that they do.

112
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:45,790
But I would argue that if you ever interface with infants, parents, young families, these are important to sort of, like, be aware of.

113
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:52,120
That's what I'm gonna. Okay.

114
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:59,840
So this is that that that little transactional thing I like to show.

115
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:06,430
But basically, this is what a lot of these parenting interventions are trying to do in different ways.

116
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:10,190
Right. So we're trying to say child behavior.

117
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:14,270
Does this parent behavior or feelings or emotions are like this,

118
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:20,060
here's your impact on the child and let's sort of change the way you might interact together.

119
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:24,350
And so like that find intervention is trying to do this in a very micro way.

120
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:35,420
The one stop shop pediatric clinic intervention is trying to sort of give you like more sort of help out here instead of like this,

121
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:38,870
you know, immediate. How is your interaction going?

122
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:46,999
Like, fine, but they're both trying to sort of shift this parent child interaction over time and again,

123
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,389
kind of reshape that and support parents is in that video to build the skills to manage their

124
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:58,460
child and their child's challenges and also their child's everything about their child,

125
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:02,270
not only. Um, okay.

126
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:08,360
So that's kind of like a quickie review of what is important about infancy and infant relationships.

127
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:13,940
And then I can pause on talking and hear from you guys a little bit.

128
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:20,480
Um, what, what struck you guys about these different parenting approaches?

129
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:24,739
Did you have a, you have a favorite one? Did you learn something new?

130
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:29,390
Did something seem like really wacky and odd about some of these approaches?

131
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:35,450
What did you guys think? Any responses or comments to?

132
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:42,640
And I know that this one also goes through a lot of different ones.

133
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:47,330
It's more talking broadly about really relational help. But I think it's important public health.

134
00:14:49,630 --> 00:15:07,400
That swamp nurse. What do people think? An in-depth look at what exactly like a visitor it's.

135
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:20,500
She was like not only coaching them on like. But also like other aspects of their life and.

136
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:32,110
One of the women that dropped out of school. Billy should reconsider that.

137
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:38,850
We should get back in school because she knew it was. I will later in life have that education.

138
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:50,210
She really covered a lot of ground. She did have specific like nursing knowledge, so she was a resource for that.

139
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,530
Newman Yeah, absolutely. And it's kind of an old article,

140
00:15:54,530 --> 00:16:01,880
but I do love it because it just kind of unpacks what's happening in this visit and what are all the surrounding things that's.

141
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:16,070
It's just that what she's going through to do this. And Mike, you kind of crossed around here.

142
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:27,550
With. Or just like parents that, you know, do not have a study address or something.

143
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:53,190
Now it's going to be like we'll talk about this, like, app based approach.

144
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:58,350
Like there might be some additional again, this article, I think it's like from 2006 or something, it's pretty old.

145
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:04,580
But now we have other ways to maybe reach families or keep connected with families.

146
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:05,040
Absolutely.

147
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:12,780
And then I think also in your comment, it makes me think about if you're the child and you're going between different caregivers or households,

148
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:18,030
like even if you do have the same nurse come and visit during the same time period,

149
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,709
those caregivers also need to kind of coordinate and get on the same page.

150
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:33,610
And there could certainly be conflict. Actually, there's a lot of research on sort of like maternal grandma mom.

151
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:41,460
The. There's a lot there because of all those intergenerational transmissions.

152
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:51,020
Family across. Yeah, I thought.

153
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:55,800
Yeah, I just didn't know that there were this many, many interventions.

154
00:17:56,070 --> 00:18:01,960
It's something like, um. I think it's really cool.

155
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:09,190
But I thought for that specific of a time intervention, I thought I thought it was cool that they had this,

156
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:12,309
but also kind of weird that like it felt like there was like a group of,

157
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:21,910
like scientists and researchers like overanalyzing everything, like, you know, every single thing that you do and kind of like take the joy.

158
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:26,649
You're like, now it's just not every interaction is like, needed to be like the correct one.

159
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:30,630
It's okay if you like myself a few times, you know, it's not that big of a deal.

160
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:35,230
Of course you want to learn the right things, but you know, every interaction doesn't have to be.

161
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:49,060
But like in summer. And I always I try to pull for that a little bit because I think, yeah, like it could be really what?

162
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:53,920
Right. It could be anxiety provoking. It could be insensitive, it could be stressful.

163
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:57,069
It could like live in your head is like, oh, gosh, might try to do the right thing.

164
00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:06,299
So there's a lot of like skill and. Adult and parent engagement work that needs to happen before one would say, like, okay,

165
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:10,050
you want to do the five minute lunch today, we're going to analyze all your behavior.

166
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:14,310
So. Of repeated opportunities.

167
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:22,260
And that's what's so nice. Still face like if you do the still face or if you're on your phone with your infant at times.

168
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:28,210
But it's human. At this point in the world, you get a chance to repair, right?

169
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:32,849
You get a lot of repair chances remembering that you should take those repair chances.

170
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:38,130
I think it's kind of one of those points of something like the find intervention that really gets very micro.

171
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:53,979
So there's all these. I never mention.

172
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:59,889
And if you do see parents like almost acting in a way because they're like, okay, you know, someone's watching us.

173
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:04,600
And so they like try and get their kids to do certain things. And then you have to, like, reassure them.

174
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:09,040
Like, it was fine. Like, we're just here to help you evaluate your kid, make sure that you get the support.

175
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:22,630
But. I. It's really interesting that.

176
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:34,340
Like it's impossible to act to like do that performative stuff all the time and sort of thinking about it.

177
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,979
Like, you kind of want to tune up the awareness,

178
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:44,220
a little bit of watching child behavior and like have the parents sort of become have that little scientist voice a little bit inside them?

179
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:51,960
But you also don't want to say, like, you know, here are the right things to do and you must do them all the time, because none of us can do that.

180
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:52,830
None of us can do that.

181
00:20:53,040 --> 00:21:00,719
And the right things to do really also are shaped by that parent child relationship, culture and experience and lots of things.

182
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:07,040
And so I think. Like an evaluation setting.

183
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:15,050
So the segments and programs that were, you know, often if the child is sort of exhibiting behavior that's concerning or,

184
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:18,200
you know, there's a question what's going on developmentally with the child.

185
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,059
So then you come in for some evaluation.

186
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:25,730
And one of the really important parts of evaluation, because of all the attachment and everything we've been talking about,

187
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:30,680
is to look and see, well, how how does this dyad, like, navigate this interaction?

188
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:38,330
Like, what are they what are they like with each other? Can they like appropriately, like, you know, use each other for emotion regulation?

189
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:48,470
So yeah. What else about the find now that we're talking about finding that kind of, you know,

190
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,660
behavior back and forth, intervention, a lot of people think, yeah, [INAUDIBLE], um.

191
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:01,380
But just like a lot of people don't want. So.

192
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:32,940
It. That idea about her 2:00.

193
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:43,400
And what? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

194
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:52,410
No. Let's just focus on positive interactions.

195
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:55,830
That's true. Versus like calling out any of the.

196
00:22:57,370 --> 00:23:01,740
Oh, this is what, like correcting them? Yeah. Yeah, that is true.

197
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:04,299
So thanks. And I have a follow up question to that,

198
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:13,390
that that observation that you can make that absolutely others find intervention and most of these interventions that are really behavior focused.

199
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:17,650
And we'll talk about more of this when we talk about early childhood, too.

200
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:22,209
But that idea of calling out in good behavior and good examples and like, hey,

201
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:28,360
I really like how you did that or and or like if you I know in some comments and this happens every time,

202
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,040
like what if you don't see anything that's good?

203
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:37,100
Like what if you only see bad that, you know, um, there's, I would say, like, you know, as, as, you know,

204
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:41,980
imagine if you spent hours and hours and hours watching those baby videos that we watched at the beginning,

205
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:47,590
you would become very astute at, like, picking out little baby moments and.

206
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:53,490
It's a way that you could then say to the parent, like, Oh, look how she called.

207
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:56,980
She looked at you, and that could be enough, right?

208
00:23:57,030 --> 00:24:02,649
Like, so that could be an example of she looked at you and then you didn't, you know, pay attention.

209
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:09,880
And then this whole kind of drama happened, but you could sort of couch it in, like, well, look how she wants to talk to you, that kind of thing.

210
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:26,030
Yeah. Okay. Okay.

211
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:30,490
This is more in the context of like this, you know, this interaction.

212
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:43,930
And so if you're working with a population of parents, I mean, it also I get to the of times people end up in these kinds of interventions,

213
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:51,760
not necessarily these but in parenting interventions kind of like that group parenting intervention by mandate.

214
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:57,070
Right. So like they have been found to have abused their child.

215
00:24:57,070 --> 00:25:01,899
And so one of the, you know, requirements to be reunited with their child,

216
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:07,420
if the child is taken away, is to go to a parenting class or a series of parenting class.

217
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:11,650
So that's a situation for sure when you want to think about.

218
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:20,060
And their parent engagement. Like they're not going to be very motivated, but they're going to be motivated.

219
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:23,000
But it's like externally motivated to be in this class.

220
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:30,620
Like, I have to be here, but I'm going to be probably a little irritated that I'm here and I may not be ready to like take in the message.

221
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:34,309
I may not want to change my behavior for a lot of reasons.

222
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:42,170
And so there's definitely some things about like why your parents are in this situation.

223
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:50,719
So in a situation of an evaluation, when you have a child whose behavior is concerning to the parent and the parent wants to get them evaluated,

224
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:55,910
that's really different from if the parent is mandated to go to a parenting class because of child abuse.

225
00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:06,310
So I think in this population, the find they have that group has worked with kids in the foster care system, actually foster care caregivers.

226
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:15,070
And so I would say it's like one part of more than more intervention supports that they're doing.

227
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:25,270
And in these, like these micro behavioral kind of interventions, there's another one where you literally have a bug in the parent's ear.

228
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:32,889
And the interventionists is saying, like, now pick up the block, now say it's read to your child.

229
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:37,150
So like, this is a really common kind of behavioral intervention.

230
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:45,970
All interaction training is really popular. Literally a bug in the ear of the parent and the bug of the year.

231
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:52,730
But you know, the microphone. I'm a interventionist and so they're sort of like the puppeteer directing behavior.

232
00:26:54,440 --> 00:27:03,220
And I think parents, you know, get a very for sure in terms of how much they can engage or would like to engage in these types of different you.

233
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:15,030
I was going to say one thing also to for the earlier comments about like,

234
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:20,150
how do we convince, like you said, a really good phrase and I can't remember.

235
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:26,010
It was it was like societal structure or something, but like why these would be important?

236
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:33,840
And so like why would we pay tax, for example, to like fund some intervention like this in like pediatric setting or a community clinic?

237
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:43,380
And I would say that they are the bread and butter of like public health is about evaluation and data.

238
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:50,610
Right. So like, we'd like to show, hey, when we do an intervention like this, these kids have better developmental outcomes.

239
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:55,770
You know, there we'll talk more about that early childhood session about sort of big scale

240
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:59,970
evaluations of early childhood interventions and sort of what those implications are.

241
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:05,070
And I think that's where the convincing is important.

242
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:10,950
But the valuation data. Yeah.

243
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:30,110
Just when I was reading about this and. But in general, I mean, literature.

244
00:28:33,780 --> 00:29:09,340
Time's up. Sure.

245
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:38,780
And. Suddenly relevant in a public health setting.

246
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:44,210
Well, and I. I agree. And I.

247
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:54,570
That's right. So that's and I think we'll talk more about parent engagement and lack of engagement.

248
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:59,560
I think that's huge. That's a huge issue. And so what?

249
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:01,330
Oh, I thought that was mine.

250
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:15,430
And so I think also that's why that point around like eliciting passionate awareness of the processes that are happening that, you know.

251
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,360
Generally or I would argue like at this point in terms of what we know,

252
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:32,810
a universal some universal processes like intergenerational transmission of kind of how you were parent is that's like a universal process attachment,

253
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:36,360
not necessarily how we assess it, but the process of developing it.

254
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:44,640
What research has been able to show us to date is that there certainly is these

255
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:49,730
universal processes that happen in terms of child development that we know.

256
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:56,280
And, you know, I would argue we need for research on those very basic processes.

257
00:30:56,280 --> 00:31:04,250
But I think that's why it is critically important that cultural overlay in still making parenting interventions.

258
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:08,820
And I think that's why with swamp nurse particle, even that's old.

259
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:17,130
That's kind of why I liked it, because it sort of highlights how important that connection to the community is that you're working with.

260
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:22,110
Because yeah, I mean. But.

261
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:26,550
Olds. Why leave professorial self?

262
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:31,980
I'm not going to be a great interventionist, even though I've been an interventionist with families at different points.

263
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,590
You know, that's not no match for, you know, every context for.

264
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:57,230
Valuation. Oh how do I actually connecting to that about a.

265
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:04,070
But Willis article about innovations in early relational help.

266
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:10,610
That sounds just a little bit, but like the measurement of some of these things is really challenging.

267
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:20,299
We're talking about like especially and find these like micro analytics, you know, outcomes like it's kind of a hard convince to be like,

268
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:28,520
oh, they had six more and returns than the then the nonintervention family had three serve and returns over the course of a minute.

269
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:32,780
Right. That's like really, really nerding out on the data.

270
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:40,459
And I don't think that's going to be convincing to a policymaker. But if you can say like that slide with the mom and the baby,

271
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:49,850
playing with the importance of these service return things is actually that they help grow baby brains and they help the.

272
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:59,290
Then you have to link it to that bigger frame of like why we care about these little micro intervention micro analysis.

273
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:07,650
Similarly with swamp nurse, like a different type of measurement question, but like how do we measure like that action?

274
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:13,270
It's like therapeutic alliance. Like, how connected is the family to their interventionist?

275
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:18,380
That's like. Really hard to measure and it's really hard to.

276
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:23,569
I think, Joe, you said like either mental manual wise or generalized, like that's hard, right?

277
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:26,810
Because there was a huge literature on like therapists effects.

278
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:38,210
Right. And it's really hard to create this, you know, dynamic, engaging person who is going to be the perfect fit for a family.

279
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:45,170
So again, I think it's this balancing act of here are some things that we think are important to promote.

280
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,090
And, you know,

281
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:56,780
let's get sort of buy in as we can from the relevant population we're working with to figure out the best way to promote those those goals.

282
00:33:56,780 --> 00:34:06,920
Right. And I think about this and like, how do we teach in quotes parents to, quote unquote, teach their children?

283
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:12,470
Right. So how do we engage parents and sort of create buy in?

284
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:16,750
And I think there's multiple levels. So there's that like evaluation policy.

285
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:22,670
Here's the data. We know these things work to, you know, promote child health over the long term.

286
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:30,650
And that's like a lot of research and evaluation on an individual parent level or family level.

287
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:36,880
Here's why you might want to try this out, see what it works.

288
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:42,170
You know, see what works with you and your child. You know, so there's lots of different levels of.

289
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:48,350
I don't. Somebody do something.

290
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:53,330
But, you know, I feel like Biden is probably a better the way I tend to think about it.

291
00:34:56,780 --> 00:35:03,890
I think. I think we'll talk more about that really relational help.

292
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:06,340
But what I liked about this article too,

293
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:15,100
and this is kind of like a relatively hot off the presses article that is related to that AP statement on the importance of early relational help,

294
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:19,380
that they list a few different programs in here.

295
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:26,920
And so I think one thing that could be helpful, again, just to have in your back pocket,

296
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:32,529
if you go into a professional setting where you're going to be seeing like parents and children maybe,

297
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:37,780
or young children, just kind of keeping in mind that these things are out there and like maybe,

298
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:42,040
you know, for your context, looking up some programs, knowing about things that,

299
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:45,190
you know, if you see a dyad and they come in to talk to you about nutrition,

300
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:50,450
but you're like, Huh, I'm noticing like you could be like better connected with each other or something like that.

301
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:57,340
And I have a one year old. Then also you could think about resources for that family that are in that sort of more like relationship space.

302
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:04,210
Okay. Um, any other thoughts on the meetings or those interventions?

303
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:16,640
Screening tool for Dr. Like this in the zone, like how to do that?

304
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:30,300
Oh, like. So you want. Would be a good.

305
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:43,080
I'm like trying to think of doctor patient communication research that I know, and I feel like that might be close to impossible in terms of it,

306
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:49,370
just in terms of reality of like insurance and who's available and who's in your network if you have insurance and all of that stuff.

307
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:59,760
But I certainly think that like some sort of matching screening tool would be really interesting to try to implement.

308
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:04,470
I think it just would be like hard to go to like Blue Cross Blue Shield.

309
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:14,660
Sure. Like maybe you want to. Yeah.

310
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:19,930
No like in from a big picture data perspective. Like, could you put that in?

311
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:23,050
Could that like it's at a really high level screen. I don't know. Yeah, I know.

312
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:26,950
I forget the most science like psychology today or something like that.

313
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:33,669
So like but not like on, not on all the characteristics that I think you were kind of talking about,

314
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:37,840
but like you can select what insurance you have, you can think about like what therapy they like.

315
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:42,460
Yeah, I think you can match like sort of that way and like what your concerns are.

316
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,780
Like personality. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's true.

317
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:51,740
And that's actually a great example because yeah, I was thinking like, how deep can we go?

318
00:37:52,130 --> 00:38:01,400
Right? Like, if you don't know. But, but yeah, like and demographic characteristics and populations that people work with and it's not.

319
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:08,180
I look and I think they do a reasonable job.

320
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:14,840
And then of course it goes back to the access like, well, I wanted this person and I would have to wait two and a half years,

321
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:20,480
so maybe I'll be a little more flexible and I'll go with this, you know, which is that big access.

322
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:33,799
It's just. Well, I always like to talk about the stuff,

323
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:41,510
but it's always great to get sort of this just perspectives from different different disciplines and different,

324
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:48,650
you know, potential professional areas. Because I think that one of the key pieces is like getting this,

325
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:53,300
I would say like message out to lots of different specialties and different

326
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:58,310
sectors working with children and families about sort of the importance of the.

327
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:12,330
So let's talk a little bit more. We've already talked about some, but these ideas around implementation like, okay,

328
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:17,300
you'd want to do the five intervention or a modified version of it, how are we going to do it?

329
00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:22,260
Hiring in your families, you know, to engage and who do we want to be the interventionist?

330
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:31,590
And, you know, can we come in families, homes and it's covered and all sorts of things can happen to interfere with our you know.

331
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:38,230
So like you're sort of a, you know, homeowners visiting thing that actually look like it's in a clinic.

332
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,900
To me, this looks like a very like off the see background.

333
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:45,140
So maybe that's an in-person or a in clinic visit.

334
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:52,069
There's someone in the home and they're trying to, you know, at the breakfast table with the kid right there deliver like an intervention.

335
00:39:52,070 --> 00:40:00,200
So then, you know, anybody who's ever done home visits in here knows that, like you can't control the environment of a home visit very well.

336
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:04,910
And so if you're trying to do your intervention and around the kid and the kid is sitting right there,

337
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:11,300
like, how much do you have to like switch up the order of your intervention? And then so you're like deviating from a manual intervention.

338
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:16,759
So I think home visits really highlight all the ways that it's like really,

339
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:23,140
really difficult to sort of deliver like a perfect evidence based intervention with fidelity, right?

340
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:30,500
For those of us who like to read and take and thought about implementation science, like it's really hard to be like a perfect intervention.

341
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:37,520
And I would argue like if you are like a robotic interventionist delivering the manual, like you're not really reaching the family very well.

342
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:45,919
So I think it's again that balance of like, we know this is an intervention we want to try to do to address these processes,

343
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:53,930
but we also have to be aware, like we're interacting with another human and set of humans, right, in a family.

344
00:40:53,930 --> 00:41:00,440
And so we have to think about how our intervention efforts are, you know, read and received.

345
00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:04,219
Here's just some more pictures of like home visiting interventions.

346
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:10,280
One, I wanted to put up a dad as well because we've already talked about it's not just like a mom child diet,

347
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:19,070
even though in infancy we also often focus on, okay, and then of course, of course, COVID.

348
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:26,930
And we certainly, again, those of us who've ever like been in this business of delivering interventions,

349
00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:30,710
working with families, being in homes, that was a big shift.

350
00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:36,739
A lot of things got sort of, I would argue, like figure it out in a way that they needed to get figured out.

351
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:39,220
And people were like, Oh yeah, we could probably do telehealth interventions.

352
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:44,120
And all of a sudden it was like, Oh my gosh, we've got to figure out how to do those and make it reasonable.

353
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:52,040
And so I think that there have been like some positive, you know, gains around figuring out all those systems.

354
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:59,870
But and I, I was looking for like a an image that would just illustrate,

355
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:05,600
like the settings in which we've done things during COVID and somebody like in the back of their car,

356
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:11,630
you know, they're in a parking lot to get service and they're trying to do a telehealth visit.

357
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:18,770
That's sort of, to me, like highlighted flexibility on the provider side, the patient side.

358
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:29,060
And yeah, what do we need to do from sort of a social, structural, you know, perspective, policy perspective to kind of make this work better?

359
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:37,850
Um, I think, what do you guys think about a health?

360
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:47,740
So. No.

361
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:25,090
And. This question, how do you establish, like, not necessarily an early relationship but like a trusting relationship too in that context?

362
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:42,420
Like I it. But.

363
00:44:06,570 --> 00:44:14,050
Will that help change the. For, like, psychotherapy, buddy.

364
00:44:19,210 --> 00:44:23,130
I didn't see my doctor in person.

365
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:27,810
So. About if one has like the most skilled, amazing telehealth person who's like super engaging and they see that, she said, like, she didn't see me.

366
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:34,720
That's like what they can see on your screen. Oh, and we are cleanup workers.

367
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:40,190
However, and unless it's very purposeful to sort of say,

368
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:46,370
like in the case of a home visit and thinking about what environment a child or person is living in.

369
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:51,559
You're saying like, yeah, you could say like, walk me around your house and I'll try to do like an inventory.

370
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:55,130
But that feels a little jarring too, right?

371
00:45:55,160 --> 00:46:03,110
Unlike maybe obvious that this person was in their car during a visit, but that could maybe, you know, not share that.

372
00:46:03,110 --> 00:46:08,270
And so there's so much that could be kind of hidden or missed.

373
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:19,120
Have you had. But the effect of the therapeutic alliance being.

374
00:46:27,850 --> 00:46:38,830
Not affected. I would say that we are getting more research out all the time because obviously we've had this huge natural experiment of COVID and on,

375
00:46:39,090 --> 00:46:42,220
you know, telemedicine type relationships.

376
00:46:43,930 --> 00:46:50,740
So I would say the jury is out, but it would not surprise me if that if some studies say, you know,

377
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:56,260
find, oh, it's not as it's it's not as effective or the therapeutic alliance is not as strong.

378
00:46:58,150 --> 00:47:06,070
I think and this I put earlier relational health. But I could see I could put a therapeutic alliance here, too.

379
00:47:06,070 --> 00:47:12,250
Right. So the relationship between any provider of any kind and their participant or their client.

380
00:47:13,930 --> 00:47:17,290
So I would say we don't know. I think there's that balance.

381
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:24,400
There's a lot of questions here to think about. But that idea of like matching with your therapist or with your provider or whatever.

382
00:47:25,030 --> 00:47:32,020
That's a that's a good choice to have. And different things can work differently for different people, for different problems at different times.

383
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:39,579
But I think that one question that comes up for me here is, well, these two,

384
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:43,270
so like we know there's a lot of inequities and just difference in like who has access,

385
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:48,760
who is served, who's easily able to do a 2:00 appointment, you know, via Zoom.

386
00:47:51,100 --> 00:48:00,820
And then this question of you said in your you're talking about people serving the state who have special skill sets, expertize.

387
00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:04,940
That's really critically important for that bigger access issue.

388
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:12,010
So thinking about like from the public health standpoint, some telemedicine access is better than zero access.

389
00:48:12,010 --> 00:48:18,280
But if we get very comfortable with saying like, oh, that's fine, we've addressed the access issue, I think that is problematic.

390
00:48:20,170 --> 00:48:28,080
One program and I think I forgot to put on the slide but that I want to just call out here is there is a group in psychiatry here called M.S. three.

391
00:48:28,090 --> 00:48:35,950
And what they do is they support the providers who maybe don't have psychiatry expertize and training.

392
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:41,290
So providers here at U of M, which is like brimming with psychiatry expertize and training,

393
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:46,420
are connected to primary care providers across the state of Michigan,

394
00:48:47,110 --> 00:48:56,110
and they provide consultation and support to those primary care providers who are like, oh, like, I don't have this expertize that I need help.

395
00:48:56,530 --> 00:48:59,159
And so I think that's a really important point as well.

396
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:07,180
Like, so not only how to support the individual to make a telemedicine visit, but also those providers who are like thrown in with everybody,

397
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:12,819
you know, having a lot of things to manage and a little bit of like parent child interventions.

398
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:17,530
But it's kind of true across the board, the sort of specialized expertize.

399
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:27,399
So I think it's lots to think about, definitely balance and to turn back to the really,

400
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:31,900
really small part in this in this thinking about it, in this way, like,

401
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:37,870
could we, you know, this is like a pilot study of people who were like, okay,

402
00:49:37,870 --> 00:49:41,980
we know what the kind of core processes are to intervene with an early relational health.

403
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:48,550
You know, we don't have the, you know, person power to like have in-person visits.

404
00:49:48,550 --> 00:49:52,960
And this also happened, of course, because of like COVID happening and all these other things.

405
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:58,150
But they were trying to basically make an app and they'd been working on it before COVID.

406
00:49:58,150 --> 00:50:08,410
But I think that kind of spurred it on around trying to again, like amp up this noticing in parents of like, oh, there's a little moment here like.

407
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:14,120
What what what is important about how you parents engage in this moment with your

408
00:50:14,130 --> 00:50:19,590
infants that can sort of work towards building your relationship for the future?

409
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:25,860
And so this is this app. It's got small moments, big impact.

410
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:33,360
And there's just little, you know, windows and things about like watch this interaction again to like sort of alert the parent.

411
00:50:33,370 --> 00:50:39,089
Like it's sort of like to awaken the parents noticing now with those baby videos of, you know,

412
00:50:39,090 --> 00:50:44,460
what these parents and children are doing together and then connect it to your parenting,

413
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:48,600
your parent emotions, and then connected personally to you and your infant.

414
00:50:48,600 --> 00:51:00,630
So do I think this would be an effective way to, like, have a parent who, you know, had abused their child physically and really in an awful way?

415
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:07,360
Both of them do this app and then be reunited with their child? No, like, I don't think that's adequate.

416
00:51:08,430 --> 00:51:18,490
I think like if a parent is up for it, like to give this app, you know, to every new parent like, yeah, I think that'd be awesome.

417
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:24,399
You know, so thinking about like that matching of the level of intervention we want to talk about with the,

418
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:30,090
the lead of the family and I think something like this, you know, if it were to work,

419
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:36,069
beginning to evaluate it and have data on it, um, they found there were, you know, some,

420
00:51:36,070 --> 00:51:46,540
they basically measured like how accurately, how carefully a parent could sort of perceive infant emotions and self-rated stress.

421
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:50,200
So, like, are these the most awesome measures in the world?

422
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:56,890
Not necessarily. They are some of the most robust measures in the world, not necessarily the most robust measures in the world.

423
00:51:56,890 --> 00:52:01,240
But like there's some signal there, maybe like it would be great to try it out on a bigger sample.

424
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:08,139
They had 58 people. So I think a light touch like this that kind of activates that, like parenting awareness,

425
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:12,190
like, oh, these babies are, you know, doing these things and trying to tell me this.

426
00:52:12,190 --> 00:52:18,190
And maybe if I do this, the baby will change their behavior. I think that's a cool idea.

427
00:52:20,350 --> 00:52:24,270
And. Any thoughts on that?

428
00:52:24,310 --> 00:52:27,900
Yeah, Jackie. Question. Do you know? It's out by chance, right?

429
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:32,730
The spirit says, How are you feeling in the face of life? Like feeling sad or like angry?

430
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:39,780
Does it continue then to like, maybe like whatever health techniques or programs for like stress management or.

431
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:49,410
That's right. And I'm not sure. But if I were the designer of this app and these are like medical people.

432
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:54,950
So if they're these are these are all just different emotions.

433
00:52:54,960 --> 00:53:06,100
And there's like serious happy. They're not like a screen or a like mental health.

434
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:11,200
You know, I don't re meeting care kind of screen.

435
00:53:11,650 --> 00:53:20,440
And so if someone's as angry here, I don't know that that would necessarily like trigger a referral kind of thing or a resources, but it could.

436
00:53:20,650 --> 00:53:24,370
And the question like, how much do you want to ask in this app?

437
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:35,450
Totally a personal way. And so, like, if they were asking like that, more depression type questions,

438
00:53:35,450 --> 00:53:44,990
I think it would be great and important to be able to put in resources that would like trigger the like this because I develop, you know what I mean?

439
00:53:45,110 --> 00:53:50,750
Yeah. I was wondering if it was kind of like just general how you're feeling or if they would be prompted like,

440
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:54,889
let's do this five minute meditation, investigate. Why are you feeling angry?

441
00:53:54,890 --> 00:54:01,250
Or Uh huh. Uh huh. Yeah. I mean, you know, that would change my thoughts about that one.

442
00:54:01,430 --> 00:54:11,170
Yeah, one can do a lot. I mean, I don't think here that they did do like little exercises with maybe it's less like personal.

443
00:54:16,690 --> 00:54:22,510
Take. CS I did, I did.

444
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:28,320
I think I got as far as like making an account for this and you can, and people can try it out but like.

445
00:54:29,870 --> 00:54:39,640
Either to do, and I'm sure I ran out of time, but it'd be interesting to check it. There's no like there's so many apps out there for so many things.

446
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:45,910
I think that really understanding the core processes that you're trying to tackle

447
00:54:45,910 --> 00:54:51,700
or address or engage with an app and who your population is that could benefit,

448
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:54,930
you know, that is appropriate to sort of reach by, you know,

449
00:54:55,180 --> 00:55:03,370
with that kind of like such universal perspective is that those are really important things to know before we kind of.

450
00:55:06,630 --> 00:55:11,690
But I thought this is also a group who does a lot of work in this early relational health space.

451
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:20,310
Like they know their content, you know, and they were like, okay, now we're going to try to switch this modality of intervention.

452
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:36,860
Sure I haven't gotten through all the topics, so I don't know if anybody is interested, particularly in their few mental health mental health papers.

453
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:40,610
But, you know, there's a lot of really fascinating work right now.

454
00:55:40,610 --> 00:55:43,430
And I just teach mental health class. And so we talked a lot about like.

455
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:54,690
Crisis text line and all sorts of these like light touch, app based approaches to address mental health concerns.

456
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:58,919
And that's really it's a fascinating space.

457
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:03,479
It's a really I think like more information and data are needed in that space.

458
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:10,620
But knowing the huge gap we have in terms of mental health care access, I think it's an important space.

459
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:13,649
We just don't really know exactly the effectiveness.

460
00:56:13,650 --> 00:56:20,640
And I would argue there's some harm that we could cause by saying like, Oh yes, now we have crisis text line.

461
00:56:21,090 --> 00:56:25,139
We're fine, like we're not fine, you know. So I think it's really important.

462
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:29,670
And again, in any of them that like what is your population need?

463
00:56:29,670 --> 00:56:32,490
Is it a prevention? Is it like basically healthy population?

464
00:56:32,970 --> 00:56:37,620
And I just talked about like the biological stresses and everything that you have once you've had a child.

465
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:46,350
But like could you roll out an app like this to kind of your average parent who's not particularly high stress like that?

466
00:56:46,350 --> 00:56:51,870
Seems like it could be a nice way to sort of get that prevention parent parenting like mindset.

467
00:56:52,530 --> 00:56:56,610
Yeah. So like, I know it needs more of an impact to do this.

468
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:08,170
It's a child. Child. How would you get that message across as well about like, you know, just pay attention today.

469
00:57:13,170 --> 00:57:16,860
Yeah. Yeah, well you could certainly put in like this is the Y, you know,

470
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:23,690
you're like laying the groundwork for your future relationship with your child that, you know, you can have 0ff,

471
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:27,900
you could have, you know, the early childhood and they're early, you know,

472
00:57:28,470 --> 00:57:32,910
there are many apps that are kind of like following along, like your child's development.

473
00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:35,879
Some really interesting. Oh, I forget who it is.

474
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:43,620
Someone is doing one like a project to reach dads, like especially nonresident dads with like, here's your child,

475
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:48,749
you know, they're growing over time and like, take us take a picture, which again, that's a whole nother thing.

476
00:57:48,750 --> 00:57:52,620
Like, what do we do with the data when we have pictures of people's children? Like, what is that?

477
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:56,460
But it's a way to engage parents, you know? So it's like that again, of this balance.

478
00:57:56,940 --> 00:58:02,040
But like with the dad app, it was, you know, trying to engage a nonresident dad,

479
00:58:02,550 --> 00:58:08,340
you know, in like, hey, here's your baby now here's your baby now here's your baby. Now let's read about what your average five month old is doing.

480
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:13,110
Here's let's read about what's your average, you know, seven year old is doing. So you could tailor it by age.

481
00:58:13,230 --> 00:58:17,460
You like it could grow with the family for sure.

482
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:32,760
It's a lot of like cool. As long as we know what content and being responsible for understand what it's like, affable and like light touch.

483
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:36,150
And then when that could even be harmful to think that that.

484
00:58:42,430 --> 00:58:48,910
And some of our like School of Information collaborators like there are some dual students I know each

485
00:58:48,970 --> 00:58:55,750
bece and they like love to do all the user experience stuff and they're like really excited about that,

486
00:58:55,750 --> 00:59:01,930
but they don't really do the content and so like they need content kind of expertize from.

487
00:59:04,730 --> 00:59:08,540
On the app world, see?

488
00:59:10,810 --> 00:59:19,299
I'm thinking about this this video that the adult capacities and this is all kind of you know, it's like this again, I say balance all the time,

489
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:25,840
but it is it's like this balance between, you know, supporting parents and saying you're so important in your child's life.

490
00:59:28,430 --> 00:59:32,329
The flip side of like, we don't want to blame you for everything that's going wrong in your child's life.

491
00:59:32,330 --> 00:59:40,570
And it's really difficult. And so I think that's why, back to what I was saying at the beginning around intergenerational transmission,

492
00:59:40,580 --> 00:59:45,350
being aware of its own stuff affects your parenting is really important.

493
00:59:46,970 --> 00:59:50,540
And we think we talked about some of this in the ACS session, too.

494
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:57,739
But like it may seem like I think this is a little bit of a convince, too, because parent apparently said,

495
00:59:57,740 --> 01:00:04,550
well, I'm an adult like my, you know, experience of when I'm when I had a when I was an infant.

496
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:07,970
And I remember them, like, why on earth would they affect my parenting? You know?

497
01:00:08,870 --> 01:00:17,900
But there's a lot that sort of goes on in that space. And then how do adult capacities and I would argue that's like, you know.

498
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:23,080
Um. Everything from, like, uh.

499
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:32,849
You engage to like busyness in life and also like, you know, skepticism about the topic.

500
01:00:32,850 --> 01:00:36,030
Like all sorts of things go into that adult capacity space.

501
01:00:39,270 --> 01:00:40,739
And then here, like,

502
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:48,360
I think one of the things that we can think about doing and again from this kind of public health standpoint is when you interact with parents,

503
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:56,070
are there things that you can like highlight or pull out of that parents life context experience that are more like the

504
01:00:56,490 --> 01:01:02,550
ease or the benevolent childhood experiences either the parent has experienced or that they can provide for their child.

505
01:01:03,150 --> 01:01:10,300
And so it's kind of like this idea of, you know, talking with parents about protective factors that.

506
01:01:12,150 --> 01:01:17,049
But there are people we talked about aloe plants. I wouldn't necessarily use that term.

507
01:01:17,050 --> 01:01:21,940
But like, you know, is there somebody who you go to for support? Is there somebody involved in the life of your child?

508
01:01:21,940 --> 01:01:25,090
Is there somebody that you see frequently and talk to you about?

509
01:01:25,510 --> 01:01:30,490
Child raising child. And those could all be supportive.

510
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:36,280
Our parents, they don't need to be in the home. They could be, you know, your neighbor who, like lost is your kid when you need to go to work.

511
01:01:37,540 --> 01:01:37,960
That kind of.

512
01:01:38,950 --> 01:01:50,589
Um, also like what are some positive, you know, fixes that the current may have had and then current kind of positive influences and supports.

513
01:01:50,590 --> 01:01:56,830
And I put identities to their because they're thinking about, you know, culture and where,

514
01:01:56,980 --> 01:02:04,060
how we've been parented, what our families were like, like what about your family or your identity is important.

515
01:02:04,390 --> 01:02:06,910
What would you like, you know, to carry on to your child?

516
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:15,460
And if you're talking to parents, many parents will, like engage in some level of conversation around.

517
01:02:17,690 --> 01:02:25,830
And also like to tend to say that, you know, if you're engaging parents and you sort of positive protective factors and like identifying them,

518
01:02:25,850 --> 01:02:34,759
thinking about them, it does kind of change a little bit of mindset around child parenting and like the stresses of parenting,

519
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:43,010
which a lot of top of mind, they can kind of take people out of the immediate moment of parenting stress and sort of say,

520
01:02:43,010 --> 01:02:47,000
Oh yeah, these are the positive things I'd like to instill in my child.

521
01:02:50,930 --> 01:02:55,729
Okay. So that's mostly I'll go through one, a few model things.

522
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:59,450
So I think I'll just pose these.

523
01:02:59,450 --> 01:03:06,139
But we can, we'll return to these in parenting interventions but other ones and I think it's this, this, again,

524
01:03:06,140 --> 01:03:15,380
this balance of like how do we engage and support parents and kind of get our message across of what we think is important and meaning like,

525
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:23,840
you know, science and evaluation that's been done and what we understand about child development of what shape it but avoid parent blaming.

526
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:29,990
So putting parents in their position of importance but also allowing parents to

527
01:03:30,620 --> 01:03:33,740
forgive themselves if they're feeling that they're not doing the right thing.

528
01:03:34,430 --> 01:03:37,880
And then what can we do to support parents in nontraditional settings?

529
01:03:38,030 --> 01:03:43,130
So that's that like not in a parenting class, but also, you know, in any kind of setting.

530
01:03:43,140 --> 01:03:50,299
So there are some really, you know, different models, again, like these like touch models.

531
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:55,480
Could there be like a relational health app QR code at the library, you know what I mean?

532
01:03:55,550 --> 01:03:59,540
Like these sort of ways to kind of think about that bigger context in which top.

533
01:04:01,770 --> 01:04:11,150
And families and parents of very young children might need support because, again, it's a stressful time of parenting potentially.

534
01:04:11,690 --> 01:04:16,330
And then we've talked about some of the challenges to the intervention models, and we'll come.

535
01:04:17,410 --> 01:04:29,680
Those. And I think I would also just say thinking about not necessarily intervention specific, but thinking about the babies movie,

536
01:04:30,220 --> 01:04:32,740
if people have watched it and thinking about their papers,

537
01:04:34,030 --> 01:04:39,870
there are lots of different examples in there about a lot of lots of different types of parenting behaviors.

538
01:04:40,510 --> 01:04:43,600
And that's, I think, a better place to think about that balance.

539
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:49,630
Like what are these specific behaviors that we're seeing and what are the function of those behaviors?

540
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:58,750
And like, what is the, you know, kind of ad or whoever is interacting with the child when they sort of trying to accomplish with those behaviors.

541
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:04,509
And so I think, you know, it's like thinking about different levels of analysis, if you will.

542
01:05:04,510 --> 01:05:07,120
So like these behaviors on the surface look really different.

543
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:13,060
But if you kind of dove in, why might these behaviors be kind of working to accomplish the same goals?

544
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:22,100
So I'll just kind of go through a few more.

545
01:05:22,550 --> 01:05:27,560
These are more basic intervention things that we'll talk to that we'll talk about also,

546
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:31,459
but along the lines of like, how do we engage parents in parenting programs?

547
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:35,660
Because I think it's a really challenging population. Many population.

548
01:05:36,540 --> 01:05:40,050
It's like parents are busy. Pets have. You know, they're.

549
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:46,540
Any parenting networks that they're consulting already, like, why would I come to this parenting group?

550
01:05:47,770 --> 01:05:52,990
So like, how do we sort of think about ways to increase access, to increase increased enrollment?

551
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:57,129
Can we deliver these interventions in community settings?

552
01:05:57,130 --> 01:06:04,780
And connecting with many partners is certainly always important. So that's like a that's again, like an big bread and butter issue.

553
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:11,229
There have been a lot of you know, there's certainly stigma like, oh, why did you go to parenting classes?

554
01:06:11,230 --> 01:06:15,010
And they're really not that right. That's sort of something to to counteract.

555
01:06:15,970 --> 01:06:20,220
And then this question about like offer incentives to engage.

556
01:06:20,230 --> 01:06:27,070
So these are things like home visiting programs, people, they're available, but people don't attend.

557
01:06:27,140 --> 01:06:31,540
Right. And so how do we sort of increase involvement and ombudsman programs?

558
01:06:31,540 --> 01:06:37,299
And there's some interesting work going on here at U of M around different levels of incentives.

559
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:41,890
Do you do a phone call? Do you how do you do it? You know, get people to come to the first visit?

560
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:47,950
Do you change the policies, you know, required to come to home visiting programs?

561
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:54,280
So if people are interested in that, I can give you resources to find out more.

562
01:06:55,060 --> 01:06:58,150
This, again, these are sort of classic intervention issues.

563
01:06:58,150 --> 01:07:04,690
But thinking about it in that parenting intervention context, it's important to think about like who are the interventionists?

564
01:07:04,690 --> 01:07:08,520
Do they know this content support for the intervention?

565
01:07:08,550 --> 01:07:12,580
So I don't think I know people mentioned in their written response, but we didn't mention them here per se.

566
01:07:12,610 --> 01:07:17,920
Like thinking about wanna in the Swamp Nurse paper article.

567
01:07:18,910 --> 01:07:23,530
Where's her support? Like she was managing a lot of things right now.

568
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:31,840
So a lot of this question about burnout, secondary trauma that people talk about a lot in the therapy world,

569
01:07:32,110 --> 01:07:38,200
that's really important even in the public health world as well, because there's a lot to manage.

570
01:07:38,860 --> 01:07:43,269
So where's the support for interventions and then how to design for delivery on a macro scale?

571
01:07:43,270 --> 01:07:49,540
So that's this idea of like how do we do things you how you get things like out into the public health space.

572
01:07:50,380 --> 01:07:54,220
And then we've talked about intervention design, modality of delivery.

573
01:07:54,220 --> 01:08:00,610
So like is it a map? Is it a home visitor coming to your house and location?

574
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:05,680
It's kind of connected to that. Is it in your car? And is a content culturally appropriate?

575
01:08:06,220 --> 01:08:11,140
And then parents specifically like how do we build sensitivity trust with parents?

576
01:08:11,140 --> 01:08:15,459
And this question of like what do we do when we see less desired behavior?

577
01:08:15,460 --> 01:08:20,500
So that will come up again when we're talking about child interventions in like preschool preschoolers,

578
01:08:21,670 --> 01:08:25,330
but that those are critical issues and I do not have the solutions to that.

579
01:08:25,450 --> 01:08:29,360
But I think that having an awareness of that, like a lot of this,

580
01:08:29,410 --> 01:08:35,200
my my goal in this class is for people who are kind of going to go out and not necessarily be parent child interventionists,

581
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:40,150
but like will work in other spaces, but kind of carry this awareness along with you.

582
01:08:40,870 --> 01:08:43,030
These are all very important pieces to think about.

583
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:56,080
And then I always like to show this slide because this was like an AP messaging piece around, um, you know, if you're at the doctor's office,

584
01:08:56,080 --> 01:09:02,170
if you're at your pediatrician's office, like, you know, this is, this kid is saying, Oh, ask the doctor about my emotional development too.

585
01:09:02,170 --> 01:09:08,970
And kind of back to the SDH or the social determinants of health screening, ideas and aces screening and everything from last week.

586
01:09:08,990 --> 01:09:17,590
Like it's a lot to pack into an office visit. So like, how do we you know, on the one hand, this is definitely where so many kids are, right?

587
01:09:17,620 --> 01:09:21,220
So many kids are reached in pediatric spaces.

588
01:09:22,990 --> 01:09:26,050
But like, how much can we do in those visits and.

589
01:09:27,950 --> 01:09:37,610
This is a little bit like guilt inducing both to like parents and also to providers, but it's an interesting like messaging approach.

590
01:09:39,980 --> 01:09:45,380
Okay. So Netflix next.

591
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:51,050
What's today? Thursday. Okay. Next week, we're we're going to move to early childhood.

592
01:09:51,140 --> 01:09:57,740
So like, you know, the five year olds, preschoolers, they can do many different things from infants.

593
01:09:57,750 --> 01:10:06,560
So we'll kind of get like any kind of mini lecture video about that and then kind of finish up thinking about infants with the babies people.

594
01:10:07,070 --> 01:10:13,880
And I will stick around in case we have any questions.

595
01:10:57,210 --> 01:11:47,040
This. That jacket I was going to take, it was like outerwear.

596
01:11:47,110 --> 01:11:52,620
I mean, I'm going online here. I.

597
01:15:40,940 --> 01:15:44,630
What are you doing there? How are you? Good. How love yesterday.

598
01:15:45,220 --> 01:15:50,940
All. I really only had to talk for like 15 minutes, so.

599
01:15:51,270 --> 01:15:54,390
Yeah, I kind of, like, done, I think.

600
01:15:56,510 --> 01:16:01,000
The. Yeah.

601
01:16:01,020 --> 01:16:06,520
No, it really wasn't. It was like that first one was like the big one, the black zero he had to go through.

602
01:16:06,530 --> 01:16:13,550
Yet I had to talk for like 15 minutes. But then after that, it was kind of just like, oh, it's just like open office hours.

603
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:21,550
Hmm. The sponsor or.

604
01:16:29,860 --> 01:16:34,700
It really kind of just feels like it never stops. It's like you submit a homework and it's like, All right, I'm.

605
01:16:39,610 --> 01:16:46,509
That's just how it is. Yeah.

606
01:16:46,510 --> 01:16:50,560
I have another one today. Three. The.

607
01:16:53,530 --> 01:16:58,069
I'm in. Then I go to that one. Now.

608
01:16:58,070 --> 01:17:01,629
It's like I did the one this week. Now this one, I just kind of do the same thing I did.

609
01:17:01,630 --> 01:17:15,560
Yes. Yeah.

610
01:17:15,570 --> 01:17:44,240
It's like now I know what I'm doing, so. Yeah, I was.

611
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:50,910
I was a little like. I have nothing to do.

612
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:58,950
I. Tell you what we've been learning.

613
01:17:58,950 --> 01:18:12,970
I can't tell you much about. I mean, they are just like for me now, they are really good.

614
01:18:13,030 --> 01:18:45,670
Somehow they should be like. Oh, yeah. It is.

615
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:56,390
We're almost through week four. It's almost October like you know, it's we know there is this.

616
01:19:14,970 --> 01:19:19,450
Yeah. How are you? Like. So you don't want anyone to come by?

617
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:43,660
Like 601, like a little bit more. It's a lot.

618
01:19:44,110 --> 01:19:54,190
Honestly. Hard for me to follow his like up.
