1
00:00:00,057 --> 00:00:06,577
So we are in the last module for skills for supporting students through distress and crisis.

2
00:00:06,577 --> 00:00:14,887
And if you'll recall, we've talked about kind of noticing what we're observing, checking in, communicating

3
00:00:14,887 --> 00:00:25,377
understanding and support, and then asking general questions and if needed, asking some questions regarding self care and suicide.

4
00:00:25,377 --> 00:00:33,147
And now we're going to talk about kind of finishing out the whole process.

5
00:00:33,147 --> 00:00:39,237
So what you want to do next is explore options and ideally,

6
00:00:39,237 --> 00:00:44,937
you're working kind of with the student to come to their own solutions so that they feel empowered in that moment, and

7
00:00:44,937 --> 00:00:52,587
hopefully even going forward as they experience different things, that they can kind of remember this experience that they had with you,

8
00:00:52,587 --> 00:00:59,917
and it can help them to generate ideas and solutions. So some of the examples here might be,

9
00:00:59,917 --> 00:01:06,217
is there anyone else in your life that you feel comfortable talking about this with and that can help, again,

10
00:01:06,217 --> 00:01:12,187
build that kind of hammock of support where there's multiple people that could be a romantic partner,

11
00:01:12,187 --> 00:01:18,247
that can be family members, that could be other peers academically.

12
00:01:18,247 --> 00:01:25,357
So you're just kind of helping them figure out who are all of the different people who can support me and some of them may support them in different ways.

13
00:01:25,357 --> 00:01:37,377
It also increases the likelihood that at different times of day, there's, when one person isn't available, you have some back-up people to talk to.

14
00:01:37,377 --> 00:01:41,187
What types of things have helped you in difficult situations before?

15
00:01:41,187 --> 00:01:47,157
Often, students have strength and resilience and things that they've done to help them before.

16
00:01:47,157 --> 00:01:52,827
And so finding out, drawing some of that out of them,

17
00:01:52,827 --> 00:02:00,537
may also let you know that they use spiritual resources for coping or that working out is how they get rid of their stress.

18
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:03,927
So it can kind of help you.

19
00:02:03,927 --> 00:02:07,977
It may also let you know some things, like some red flags.

20
00:02:07,977 --> 00:02:15,467
If drinking is one of the main ways that they cope with difficult things, we might want to kind of generate some additional strategies.

21
00:02:15,467 --> 00:02:19,957
So what things have helped you calm down or feel a little bit better?

22
00:02:19,957 --> 00:02:26,917
And the idea here is not so much that we're trying to solve the whole problem, but it's just that if today,

23
00:02:26,917 --> 00:02:31,837
tomorrow, this week are really difficult, what are a few things that can help calm you down

24
00:02:31,837 --> 00:02:37,327
if you need? It can distract you, maybe make you laugh for a little bit.

25
00:02:37,327 --> 00:02:41,447
And again, we'll give you a link that has lots of options,

26
00:02:41,447 --> 00:02:46,907
so if they can't think of any, maybe you guys can look at it together and come up with ideas

27
00:02:46,907 --> 00:02:51,897
or you can give it to them to kind of take with them, and find some things that would work for them.

28
00:02:51,897 --> 00:02:55,347
And you're letting them know we're not going to probably solve the whole problem today,

29
00:02:55,347 --> 00:03:01,437
I just want to identify a few things that may help as we're figuring it out.

30
00:03:01,437 --> 00:03:07,257
What supports do you need? And what we'll talk about this a little bit more on the next slide.

31
00:03:07,257 --> 00:03:09,547
Also, would it help you break this down to small steps?

32
00:03:09,547 --> 00:03:17,417
So let's say they've gotten behind and some academic stuff, or there's just a bunch of different things happening.

33
00:03:17,417 --> 00:03:21,977
It may help them to figure out, okay what do I do first, what can I do today?

34
00:03:21,977 --> 00:03:27,757
So that may be helpful. As we're thinking about this process,

35
00:03:27,757 --> 00:03:33,257
again, I want you to think back to what parts of this feel the most comfortable to you? What parts

36
00:03:33,257 --> 00:03:39,727
feel like a stretch, a little bit outside your comfort zone, and what may feel like too much?

37
00:03:39,727 --> 00:03:43,877
You can adjust this for yourself and for the situation.

38
00:03:43,877 --> 00:03:52,667
At some points, you may need to call in more supports or hand it off more quickly.

39
00:03:52,667 --> 00:03:56,347
Sometimes you might observe some things that you don't feel comfortable inquiring about,

40
00:03:56,347 --> 00:04:01,557
and so you might need to see, within the program, if there is somebody who could check-in.

41
00:04:01,557 --> 00:04:07,437
And so whenever you're feeling overwhelmed, it's a good time to check-in, even for yourself.

42
00:04:07,437 --> 00:04:16,227
Say, are there more supports or information that I need to navigate this situation. You should never feel like you have to do it all or figure it all out in these instances.

43
00:04:16,227 --> 00:04:19,707
Sometimes you leave a conversation with a student and you have to double back

44
00:04:19,707 --> 00:04:27,117
and ask another question or bring them back another resource that you found.

45
00:04:27,117 --> 00:04:33,077
So the next step is connecting them with resources. And this could be in a variety of different ways.

46
00:04:33,077 --> 00:04:36,407
They may need some academic or professional resources.

47
00:04:36,407 --> 00:04:44,307
Sometimes students get really far in school without realizing that they may need to be assessed for learning difficulties.

48
00:04:44,307 --> 00:04:52,257
They may need, they may have really a hard time of organization and time and need to get some resources for that.

49
00:04:52,257 --> 00:04:57,567
Sometimes students may be dealing with resources that they need just to have their basic needs met.

50
00:04:57,567 --> 00:05:05,477
And so, you may have to kind of program and figure out what helps are available for them.

51
00:05:05,477 --> 00:05:07,817
Sometimes they just need more information about something.

52
00:05:07,817 --> 00:05:12,677
And so sometimes you can either point them in the direction of it, or find something outside at the time,

53
00:05:12,677 --> 00:05:22,727
find something, and get back to them. You'll also want to think about how you're going to word it, how you feel most comfortable bringing up therapy,

54
00:05:22,727 --> 00:05:29,887
because for some students, I mean, even sometimes for some of us, we're not always really comfortable talking about it.

55
00:05:29,887 --> 00:05:32,357
Thinking about how you might introduce that to the student.

56
00:05:32,357 --> 00:05:38,847
You know, I think talking with a professional where you can just say anything and get all of their

57
00:05:38,847 --> 00:05:46,677
expertize to kind of sort through the options together might be really helpful. So think about, like that might be one way to introduce it. Figure out

58
00:05:46,677 --> 00:05:54,317
how you would introduce it. And really importantly, in the context of this conversation, crisis resources.

59
00:05:54,317 --> 00:05:59,427
So here are two, we'll also make sure that you have more available.

60
00:05:59,427 --> 00:06:05,187
These are kind of the two most common, people anywhere in the U.S. can use them.

61
00:06:05,187 --> 00:06:12,087
And so, know these, but we'll also make available to you some that are Affinity Group based.

62
00:06:12,087 --> 00:06:18,087
So there are some that are more geared towards

63
00:06:18,087 --> 00:06:25,927
the LGBTQ population, there are some they're more geared towards different ethnic groups and sometimes especially in the aftermath of collective trauma,

64
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:34,267
connecting with some of these organizations who hosts online safe spaces to process, can be really helpful.

65
00:06:34,267 --> 00:06:42,907
So never hesitate to think outside the box in terms of getting students resources that might help with the things that they're talking about,

66
00:06:42,907 --> 00:06:52,357
or to ask around to get them more resources, because, I think often, the more that they feel like they have what they need to support them through,

67
00:06:52,357 --> 00:07:01,147
it's going to feel like less weight on you. It's also often, is going to help empower them and help them feel more hopeful.

68
00:07:01,147 --> 00:07:04,147
This last step, probably gets skipped the most,

69
00:07:04,147 --> 00:07:14,757
and I think it's one of the most important when it comes to your role in feeling really good about supporting people.

70
00:07:14,757 --> 00:07:23,977
In the aftermath of talking to people about difficult emotions, difficult situations that are happening in their life.

71
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:28,597
Sometimes talking about self-harm or suicide, it takes a lot of energy out of us.

72
00:07:28,597 --> 00:07:30,667
It takes an emotional toll.

73
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:42,187
And so we want to sometimes create some space later in our day to rest, to hold, to just kind of eat, sleep, take care of ourselves,

74
00:07:42,187 --> 00:07:49,417
because this is hard work and we don't want to get burned out and we don't want to leave the situation feeling

75
00:07:49,417 --> 00:07:59,017
worse than we need to because we didn't take this last step to kind of tend to whatever toll it took on us.

76
00:07:59,017 --> 00:08:03,457
You want to think about if it's important to decompress, and de-brief.

77
00:08:03,457 --> 00:08:13,727
So sometimes you want to know, in a situation like this, who would be the person that you could decompress with? Meaning,

78
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:17,397
I need to talk about the emotions that came up for me.

79
00:08:17,397 --> 00:08:26,717
For example, if you've experienced a previous trauma or even if you haven't,  listening to somebody talk about theirs, can bring up a lot of

80
00:08:26,717 --> 00:08:33,137
feeling, and having a place to process that, so it doesn't just stay stuck and you can be important.

81
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:43,497
Also, it may be important to be able to check in with the program itself, if you need to debrief, like

82
00:08:43,497 --> 00:08:48,297
this is what was said, this is what I did, did I miss anything? Because any of us,

83
00:08:48,297 --> 00:08:50,247
no matter how long we've done this, can miss something,

84
00:08:50,247 --> 00:08:57,797
and sometimes we just feel even more calm and confident in how we handled it when we can kind of walk through with someone afterwards,

85
00:08:57,797 --> 00:09:02,247
like okay, I did my little piece and support.

86
00:09:02,247 --> 00:09:07,947
We're not  all of the support, we're just a piece. So sometimes just knowing that we covered our bases,

87
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:14,197
can help us shift onto the next thing and feel better about how everything went.

88
00:09:14,197 --> 00:09:21,327
And then you may have identified some things where you want to follow-up with the student.

89
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:26,267
And some of this is just, you know, sometimes people have a lot of support in the immediate

90
00:09:26,267 --> 00:09:30,277
difficulty, but then nobody kind of checks in

91
00:09:30,277 --> 00:09:38,867
a couple weeks later and see how they're doing. So sometimes just checking in and saying, hey, I just wanted to hear how things have been since then.

92
00:09:38,867 --> 00:09:43,887
But it's especially important if there were concerns,

93
00:09:43,887 --> 00:09:50,637
and you guys identified that they said they're going to go to therapy or something, they said they were going to call a therapist, find a therapist,

94
00:09:50,637 --> 00:09:57,507
you may want to follow-up and say, hey, I wanted to check in to see if you were able to do that or if you ran into any obstacles.

95
00:09:57,507 --> 00:10:02,937
Often that little bit of follow-up, number one, conveys that you care,

96
00:10:02,937 --> 00:10:07,737
but often, like most of us know, we can say we're gonna do something, and completely forget about.

97
00:10:07,737 --> 00:10:12,397
It increases the follow-up, so kind of just check back in

98
00:10:12,397 --> 00:10:20,867
with the student, because sometimes they ran into an obstacle, they couldn't find their insurance card or whatever, and that sends the whole thing off the plan.

99
00:10:20,867 --> 00:10:23,217
And so you want to get them back on the plan.

100
00:10:23,217 --> 00:10:31,707
And if there's anything that you said that you would do, oh I'm going to get you this resource or anything like that, I'm going to check in about this and get back to you,

101
00:10:31,707 --> 00:10:35,097
you just want to make sure, wherever possible that you do that,

102
00:10:35,097 --> 00:10:39,997
because often they may be really counting on that as a part of the plan, as a part of their

103
00:10:39,997 --> 00:10:53,057
hope, as a part of their support. And so we want to make sure that we follow up on the things that we said that we would do. So, again, we've kind of gone through this whole process.

104
00:10:53,057 --> 00:10:56,677
First, just observing signs, that something may be off.

105
00:10:56,677 --> 00:11:04,417
Creating a way to just be warm and calm, and check-in, letting them know that we hear and understand what they're going through,

106
00:11:04,417 --> 00:11:09,957
and we're here to support them in the ways that feel congruent for us.

107
00:11:09,957 --> 00:11:12,777
Ask important questions to make sure we have the information that we need, and we're

108
00:11:12,777 --> 00:11:18,747
going to even ask the hard questions about self-harm or suicide, if it seems like it's indicated.

109
00:11:18,747 --> 00:11:26,167
We're going to explore options with them so that they know all of what's available, connect them with resources that they may need.

110
00:11:26,167 --> 00:11:33,137
And then as we end, we're going to check in with ourselves, see if there's any support that we need to move through the whole thing.

111
00:11:33,137 --> 00:11:41,217
And we're going to follow-up with the student and items that need to be followed up on and just to see how they're progressing.

112
00:11:41,217 --> 00:11:48,687
And then, you know, it's an end really. You may notice different things about that student or you may notice other things about that student.

113
00:11:48,687 --> 00:11:54,457
This is why that post-process is so important. You want to refuel yourself,

114
00:11:54,457 --> 00:12:01,477
so that you're able to just kind of continue to be a part of this support within your community, your family, your friends,

115
00:12:01,477 --> 00:12:10,337
that we're keeping an eye out for each other and being able to check in and support each other through difficult times.

116
00:12:10,337 --> 00:12:15,017
And so that's our full process. And if you have any questions,

117
00:12:15,017 --> 00:12:24,237
be sure to check in with the program so that we can answer those and so that you feel fully equipped to really support the students.
