1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,100
Records. See how it works. Okay.

2
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:10,890
Good. How are you? Are you able to see the classroom?

3
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:18,760
I will. Okay. Good. Wonderful. Thank you. I hope to see.

4
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:29,530
Yeah. Thank you very much for taking the time to join our course.

5
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:45,160
We have two students and one student had some special day to discuss the prospect of a recording so that everyone will have access to that.

6
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:57,380
Um, okay. Today is my group with great pleasure to introduce you to Dr. Addison, uh,

7
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:09,730
as today's speaker and computational vaccine development and Addison, it's from Michigan.

8
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:27,490
And so see Michigan for many years and he did his, uh, he received his Bachelor of Science in Bio in junior and specifically in biotechnology.

9
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:40,840
And then that's in 2013 and 2016, he received his Master of Science degree in Fire and Informatics from University of Michigan.

10
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:48,340
Following that, he pursued the college degree in fire informatics.

11
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:55,270
So despite that, he has not graduated for many years.

12
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:11,410
But he has established himself as an expert in a number of bioinformatics, reverse vaccinology and the major relevance.

13
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:19,990
The field that we have with this course and with a lot of publications, widely scientific publications.

14
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:33,700
So. It was also a student seeing the vaccin custom made in a number of years ago, at least.

15
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:47,140
So now he's an expert in bioinformatics, computational biology and the vaccinology oncology for vaccines.

16
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:54,340
So today we have very lucky to have him to speak in our class.

17
00:02:54,340 --> 00:03:02,610
And he after his graduation, he joined the GSK vaccine development.

18
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:17,170
And later, sometime this year, this summer, he joined the Moderna as one of the relatively small number of viral will match the team of scientists.

19
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:26,710
So he is supporting many different projects and a legitimate for infectious disease vaccine development.

20
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:43,630
So we are really fortunate to have him to share his knowledge and experience in bioinformatics, computational development, full backs.

21
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:57,370
So without further ado, it is aware that you to please feel free to share any of your experiences that I didn't cover with you.

22
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:11,020
Are you able to share or to give permission? Yes.

23
00:04:11,260 --> 00:09:16,290
Yes. Okay. Hmm.

24
00:48:16,090 --> 00:49:49,690
So. So it is for me.

25
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:55,610
I Oh, this is very interesting, son. Um.

26
00:49:57,330 --> 00:50:01,920
So these are for poultry schooling experiments.

27
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:11,040
Do you think this ability is also related to how big the genome of the pathogen?

28
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:15,390
I think for virus probably you have for much smaller.

29
00:50:18,660 --> 00:51:21,390
You pulled. Any questions?

30
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:24,749
I think this is a really great extension.

31
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:35,400
You know, Dr. Freelon from his career already talking about the evolution of the technology and the repeat and the managing the reverse back slides.

32
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:50,100
And but today, that's also talk really expensive and so much more detailed information on each of the new technologies.

33
00:51:50,280 --> 00:52:01,950
And the it's creates, you know, a variety of tools that could inform vaccine development use and reverse vaccinology.

34
00:52:03,990 --> 00:52:06,180
Yeah, very, very interesting.

35
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:20,879
You've mentioned this of, you know, human population, image, save or issue and to interact with the pathogen or so I suppose in some corporations,

36
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:25,980
operation is larger bigger that positive like in Africa will be,

37
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:38,600
you know for the image saver Asian in African continent because that's where the artists the human therefore often for longer time as.

38
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,330
Thank you. Great. Any questions?

39
00:53:29,530 --> 00:53:38,830
You're just trying to blend in. And so because it's a lot of hard core science, but it's all related that you can see.

40
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:48,620
It's good that, you know, the idea is to expand our knowledge.

41
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:55,210
And even we don't necessarily use this to as many of your work in the Hopkins Institute.

42
00:53:55,850 --> 00:54:05,660
Do you understand how the science advancement has made the vaccine develop more powerful than ever?

43
00:54:05,690 --> 00:54:16,240
Right. This is sort of the timeline, a sort of your slides, the vaccine innovation that the December slide is very telling about.

44
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:28,010
And what's the challenge? You know, because three HIV, TB malaria is a long recognized ten 1503 infectious diseases.

45
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:35,770
But so despite this along spend time, we're still working on the what's the challenges we discussed for a lot of difference.

46
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:47,089
And you also mentioned, Lisa, I'd like you you were discussing, you know, A.G. Immunology for Antigen.

47
00:54:47,090 --> 00:54:55,460
This is what we also discussed, not the all the reaction to the vaccine it's.

48
00:54:58,510 --> 00:55:03,820
And the Everson actually of heights of relevance to what we have been discussing.

49
00:55:04,070 --> 00:55:21,850
Thank you. Another quick question.

50
00:55:21,850 --> 00:55:27,600
You've mentioned that besides the spike protein. The work.

51
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:40,910
You also identify two or three other proteins with the potential for and some of these as variable as the spike protein or.

52
00:55:45,570 --> 01:08:55,530
Thank you. Thank you so much.

53
01:09:01,210 --> 01:09:15,780
Of course you. So she actually said, I'm here to talk to the students over 60 Minutes so that we can definitely.

54
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:35,240
Oh, it's truly an annual question for Edison and its experts is so many, you know, useful technology for vaccine development.

55
01:09:35,330 --> 01:09:45,530
I think the way we learn some term structure, vaccinology, reverse vaccinology and machine learning.

56
01:09:45,950 --> 01:10:00,440
But today, I think you provide with a nice example and also more detailed information on each of the you know,

57
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:09,889
I think this the structure of vaccinology so very exciting because you know one of the for dealing a lot

58
01:10:09,890 --> 01:10:21,470
of sense we are we need to deal with it develop new facts that maybe the just is stuck with that the

59
01:10:23,180 --> 01:10:32,720
genetic aberrations impact we talk about you think it could be possible to you know incorporate epitopes

60
01:10:33,230 --> 01:10:44,620
important for different population or region representing important variations into vaccine culture.

61
01:10:45,830 --> 01:10:54,850
So that I think, you know, we talk about the genetic diversity and how that impacts the immuno recognition.

62
01:10:54,860 --> 01:11:01,940
We talk about the basis for immunization is some memory of the adaptive immune.

63
01:11:02,690 --> 01:11:09,110
And then where you have all the variants in the population, you you you need to you know,

64
01:11:09,150 --> 01:11:21,950
worry about our previous vaccine may not be so protective but I think with these stories it's just told us there's a hope.

65
01:11:21,950 --> 01:11:32,790
And that is and I don't know how much in the vaccine industry is are actively actively pursuing as we talked about,

66
01:11:34,190 --> 01:11:40,100
one of the approach for future vaccine to reduce back some data.

67
01:11:40,370 --> 01:11:48,290
It's a disease oriented approach. When you were talking about the structure of vaccinology,

68
01:11:48,290 --> 01:12:00,590
I was thinking about that the what the disease oriented approach is basically based on, you know, where the pathogen, the disease,

69
01:12:00,980 --> 01:12:04,700
not necessarily which particular antigen, for example, pneumonia,

70
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:15,559
lung infection TB can cause and the many respiratory virus could cause that's including some of the including COVID 19.

71
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:18,650
So we're all familiar with.

72
01:12:19,250 --> 01:12:27,620
And then also after the bacteria, the infection of strep, you know, all these different organisms.

73
01:12:27,620 --> 01:12:41,780
So I sort of this maybe this a structure vaccinology has hope to incorporate epitopes from different pathogen kits in that particular antigen.

74
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:18,800
I could like a compilation. Rex and you.

75
01:13:30,190 --> 01:13:38,139
If you were to use the epitope or base, the vaccine, you start to like a compilation and stuff.

76
01:13:38,140 --> 01:13:42,250
The structure, structure, it basically changes the structure.

77
01:13:43,870 --> 01:14:20,810
I have no. Good students questions.

78
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:31,179
Yes. I know you talked a lot about like identifying himself and kind of like maximizing that.

79
01:14:31,180 --> 01:14:35,740
Right. Are there situations where.

80
01:14:38,510 --> 01:14:42,030
More like a VPN version of the virus.

81
01:14:42,780 --> 01:14:46,560
Version of the virus, rather than try to identify.

82
01:15:47,980 --> 01:15:54,870
Good question. Yeah, I always have a decision to when we have so many options, which makes sense.

83
01:15:54,880 --> 01:16:03,130
I think that there are a number of factors to determine the choice.

84
01:16:03,820 --> 01:16:09,880
Yeah, I know other questions we are up in as a questions.

85
01:16:10,060 --> 01:16:14,860
I hope you see the you know, how these relate to our previous cousin.

86
01:16:15,220 --> 01:16:28,330
You know it's just the enhance our previous and when you know what terminology today we learn what's actually is and also where to find the tools.

87
01:16:28,330 --> 01:16:37,520
I also appreciate your know including all the different tools and also the references.

88
01:16:37,570 --> 01:16:50,649
So anyway, for your interest in doing vaccines, some of our students are also doing a work of, I think, antigen selection relate to antigen selection.

89
01:16:50,650 --> 01:16:56,740
That would be that the resource you shared would be very useful.

90
01:16:57,910 --> 01:16:58,660
Thank you much.

91
01:16:58,760 --> 01:17:12,129
I also I think I told you blend is coming to talk about his study the paper published that's where also gave a good example for a particular

92
01:17:12,130 --> 01:17:24,640
pen searching how the different tools you mentioned some of the tools of course not all of them have been applied to so to attempt so.

93
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:40,850
We grew up easy. I. He was hoping to join your talk, but he had some important commitments this morning.

94
01:17:40,850 --> 01:17:44,140
So. Okay.

95
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:47,400
Thank you very much. I will talk to you later.

96
01:17:47,700 --> 01:17:57,240
And today, we just want to thank you. You always place here.

97
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:06,310
I am making sure I have my record in print.

98
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:09,970
Yes, I can.
