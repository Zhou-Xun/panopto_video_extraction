1
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:15,860
So I don't know about you, but I'm a planner when I have something coming up and I know that there can be problems.

2
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:20,719
I really like to anticipate what those problems might be and think about how I

3
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,620
might fix them in advance so I don't get surprised by the outcome in the end.

4
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:29,450
If you're the same as me, you might be thinking to yourself with a little planning.

5
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:36,560
Couldn't we possibly design our studies to save ourselves some hassle and worry with respect to confounding?

6
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:42,050
Well, that's exactly the question that we're going to cover in this particular video.

7
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:46,150
I'm going to talk to you about how you can reduce confounding by design.

8
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:51,760
So first, we're going to start with some of the topics that you've heard about a little bit in the past.

9
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:55,990
We're going to talk about randomization, restriction and matching.

10
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:59,440
We'll cover what those are, again, just so you remember.

11
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:05,559
And then what I'm going to do is I'm going to try and dove a little bit deeper into talking about some of the specifics on how each

12
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:12,910
method is working to eliminate confounding and ways in which we can have troubles or challenges with each of those approaches.

13
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:17,850
So in order to help frame the discussion for this video,

14
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:24,690
I wanted to just talk about two particular drugs that are used for people who are at high risk of cardiovascular disease.

15
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:34,080
Those two drugs are angiotensin receptor blockers or arbs and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or ACE inhibitors.

16
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:40,020
Now, in spite of the wide use of these two medicines for cardiovascular disease,

17
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:47,070
there's often been a lot of debate as to whether or not they work equally well, whether or not one works better than the other.

18
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:54,960
And really the challenge of that and what's happened is that there's concern about confounding by indication.

19
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:03,330
So what does that mean? Well, what that means is that not all of the same people are prescribed the same drugs.

20
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:11,130
It might be that physicians who know that somebody is at higher risk might choose one drug over the other.

21
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:19,110
The problem happens is that this can induce confounding by a person's risk of cardiovascular events.

22
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:24,450
In other words, somebody is risk of cardiovascular event.

23
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,780
Not only predicts whether or not they're going to have that event, but it also changes which medication they are on.

24
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:42,100
So as you may recall from your previous classes or previous videos, one way to deal with potential confounding is to randomize things.

25
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:47,230
So you can basically take the decision in this case about whether or not somebody is prescribed an error,

26
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:52,250
B, or whether or not they're prescribed an ACE inhibitor out of the hands of doctors altogether.

27
00:02:52,760 --> 00:03:00,140
And then what happens is there's just becomes a random luck of the draw as to whether or not somebody receives the drug or not.

28
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:09,830
Now, while this can be time intensive, it can be expensive, but it is ideal when it's done well, because what it does is, as I said,

29
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:17,809
it totally eliminates an association between your underlying risk of disease and your exposure here

30
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:24,860
shown by the X out on the arrow between the cardiovascular risk and the treatment that you receive.

31
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:33,270
You may have noticed that I provided this caveat that randomization has to be done well in order for it to work,

32
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:38,100
in order to make sure that randomization is functioning properly.

33
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:41,490
There's three different components that we think about.

34
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:48,090
The first is the randomization itself. Next is allocation, concealment, and the final one is blinding.

35
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:55,889
So let's talk about each of those in turn. The first step is to create a random number generator.

36
00:03:55,890 --> 00:04:02,400
Effectively, this is something that's not very hard to do. Many of you guys have used Excel to create random number generators.

37
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:10,110
There's a few nuances, so it might be that if you did a random number generator and you assigned exposure over many years,

38
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:16,500
you might just by chance, for example, get all the people exposed in the beginning of your study and no one at the end.

39
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:24,120
So you might want to do a little bit of something, maybe stratify your randomization by year just to make sure that doesn't happen.

40
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:30,690
But in general, randomization is not where errors happen or bias is introduced.

41
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,000
Now the challenge, though, is actually in the allocation.

42
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:40,970
So what it means to be allocated as taking that random number generator, you know,

43
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:46,680
in terms of whether or not exposure is supposed to be assigned or not and actually giving it to the study participants.

44
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:56,580
So the concern is, is that if a doctor actually knows what the patient they're looking at is supposed to get in terms of the treatment or not,

45
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,300
they might not assign that treatment randomly anymore.

46
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:03,419
So I don't know if any of you are Gray's Anatomy fans,

47
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:11,430
but you might recall there was a scene where there's a randomized controlled trial happening in the hospital in Seattle and Gray's Anatomy.

48
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,860
And one of the lead characters really was invested in a patient getting the treatment.

49
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:19,730
And so what she did, there's this great scene in the back.

50
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:24,149
She's looking at the envelope and trying to figure out what what that person is supposed to get.

51
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,890
And she switches the envelope. Right.

52
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:34,860
So by doing that, obviously, there is a clear violation study protocol that that treatment is no longer being allocated randomly.

53
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,090
And that's something, you know, you can anticipate and try and block.

54
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:45,390
There's also much more subtle examples of how allocation can be assigned, not randomly.

55
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:51,270
So, for example, you might think, okay, well, if I just alternate who gets the treatment,

56
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:55,110
you know, one after another first person gets a treatment, second person doesn't.

57
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:59,400
That should really be, you know, random. It shouldn't be a problem.

58
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:04,860
The trick is, is that if the physician knows, for example, that the last patient got the treatment,

59
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:12,120
the next one to come in, if they're very severely ill, the doctor knows now that they're not getting the treatment.

60
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:18,780
It might change the course of treatment for that particular person, say, by convincing them not to participate in the study.

61
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:27,209
So, again, you can see that both either by like clear violations of people trying to override the randomization or even more

62
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:33,750
subtle examples of just subconsciously steering your patient away from a trial if you know what they're going to get.

63
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:42,090
You know, this really can cause problems for the randomization and really prevent randomization for blocking confounding as anticipated.

64
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:48,649
The final step of randomization is blinding and this can happen at multiple levels.

65
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:55,460
So there's the investigator, there's the patient, there's the person collecting the data, there's the person analyzing the data.

66
00:06:55,910 --> 00:07:05,120
And the idea here is that, again, you still really want people not to know who's on the drug and who's not or who has the exposure and who does not,

67
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:10,180
so that they don't change their behaviors in any predictable way, either.

68
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:15,500
People who are assigned to a medication who figure out that they're not on it changing

69
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:23,269
whether or not they take that medication or not changing how we write down blood pressures.

70
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:29,509
For example, do you round up? Do you around down if you know that somebody is on the treatment or even analyzing the data.

71
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:34,640
So making different statistical choices to get what you think the answer is supposed to be.

72
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:39,290
All of those are problems, right, that are going to get us biased in our answers.

73
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:46,220
So how do we fix us? Well, the idea behind Blinding is to do your best to make sure that people don't know what they're getting.

74
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:50,390
One of the most common ways that we do this is by use of placebo.

75
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:59,420
You know, when it's drug trials, often you will have a sugar pill that looks just like the drug, but it doesn't contain any active ingredients.

76
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:06,560
We have done a recent study here in the Detroit area looking at air pollution and air purifiers.

77
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:11,839
And what we did is when we randomized people to having the air purifiers, they had a great air purifier.

78
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,730
It had a filter on the inside.

79
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:20,060
But when they were randomized to not getting the air purifier, what we did is we didn't just have nothing in their house.

80
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,480
We put in an air purifier. It looked like an air purifier.

81
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:27,080
It sounded like an air purifier, but it had no filter inside.

82
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:31,850
And so it wasn't actually doing anything to their air pollution levels.

83
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:36,740
And in that way, they didn't know whether or not they were treated or not.

84
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:44,380
But there was a difference going on. So very briefly, this is just a quick review of randomization.

85
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:51,910
You know, randomization is amazing both in terms of removing confounding by things that we know about and those that we don't.

86
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:57,160
On the flip side, it's much more expensive and time consuming than some of the other choices.

87
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:01,240
You really need to do it carefully with respect to allocation and blinding.

88
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:06,040
And finally, you need a large enough sample size so that just by chance,

89
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:14,380
you don't wind up having some relationship still between your treatment or exposure and some other risk factors for your outcome.
