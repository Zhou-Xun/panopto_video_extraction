1
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:10,640
Okay. So hello, everyone. Welcome to that action.

2
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:18,880
And my name is then and I'll be your GSI for one of your GSI from this extraction.

3
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:30,059
So. So today I'm going to talk about some basic rule loader setup, all that function, and reduce our calls for homework.

4
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:38,400
Problem one. And here's just some basic information about me.

5
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:45,560
So my name is Champagne, and I'm a second year Ph.D. student in biotech.

6
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:53,250
I got my master's degree in statistics and a bachelor's degree in statistics and Taiwan.

7
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:55,310
So I'm originally from Taiwan.

8
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:08,150
And regarding my office hours, I will hold my office hours every Tuesday from 6 to 7 p.m. and also every Thursday from 5 to 6 p.m.

9
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,860
And just a reminder, the Thursday office hour, it's so lonely.

10
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:18,650
However, for two to stay office hour because two of our offices are in fact allowed.

11
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:27,200
So you can choose to attend in person or by zoom and dining hall is another just I.

12
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:35,470
So. Regarding the last section.

13
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:40,910
If you're planning to attend in person, you must attend on your register.

14
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:47,960
However, we are going to record all last session so you can review the recording after that.

15
00:01:51,750 --> 00:02:00,270
So so here's just a reminder a lot.

16
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:10,010
Every week we are going to upload the virus that files into a convention.

17
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:19,420
So you just basically go to a course page and on the main page you can see that click on this link and you can see.

18
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:27,320
We will uphold that files every week. And the first one is just four slides for that section.

19
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:36,169
A second one is on the statute file. And the fourth one, the fifth one is our co file.

20
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:40,550
So if you are working with SAS, you can just download the second one.

21
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:45,440
And if you are working with our, you can just download either one.

22
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:50,920
Our markdown files are our files based on your profits.

23
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:59,410
You can't just file that for your. So this one.

24
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:08,790
Yeah. And I was like, So far so good.

25
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:16,010
They were going to first review some of our calls and samples for common

26
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:22,460
calculating cameras ratio using inverse variance method and mental hassle method.

27
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:27,490
And now we are going to review some articles and stars calls for fun part.

28
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:41,470
So here's Austrac's example. So from this example, you can see this example is very similar to our example from our homework problem.

29
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:47,810
So. So far we have about seven studies,

30
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:58,390
at least study investigate on the effectiveness of intravenous magnesium in patients with acute myocardial infarction.

31
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:06,970
Infarction. Yes. So these are this are a summary table and.

32
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:17,080
In this example, we have seven study, so each program has done representative study and terrestrial data share.

33
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:30,750
So they come. So in order to perform medical analysis in SAS, we first need to convert this raw data into a two by two table form.

34
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:38,550
So for example, you can see that if we look at our first study marking at all.

35
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:51,240
So the total number of. The total know there are about 40 people single marketing firm a group which is true man group and there are

36
00:04:51,300 --> 00:05:02,280
about 36 people in the control group and among 40 people various only one that like being a foreign group.

37
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,550
This varies only to attack and control.

38
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:14,040
So when you try to cover this in the table for getting a score of one here.

39
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:26,010
It's a toll on our in treatment groups until he is 36 and follows the phenomenon

40
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:32,750
occur own women returning from a long one end of the sea and our response to it.

41
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:41,730
So just going to hurricane Gustav now 77 times you can get seven to about two tables.

42
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,170
And after that. Sorry. So we just take all my.

43
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:59,760
And after that you can start to impose your I have that you're saying they have statement in fact.

44
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,230
So this these calls are going to just to create your dataset.

45
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:09,000
So your first your name your datasets add mac dust.

46
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:16,070
And then you start to input your variables. Here we input four variables.

47
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:23,840
So the first one is for study I.D. So the study I.D. is facing a first column.

48
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:28,850
So here we have seven studies. So this is just something from 1 to 7.

49
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:39,770
And then your second variable and your third variable is these two variable magnesium and that which text value?

50
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:43,910
Yes and no. So these are your binary variables.

51
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:48,350
And then your fourth variable is your cell counts variable.

52
00:06:49,460 --> 00:07:00,300
So. And don't forgot to put your dollar aside after the character farewells to tell us whether this variable is a character variable.

53
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:10,410
So excellent. So for example, in your daytime lines, the first line is actually just corresponded to this table.

54
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:18,079
So for example. For our first study, we post study ID equals to one.

55
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:23,000
So these four value will be equal. And you put.

56
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:28,549
For a combination of the levels of these two thermal.

57
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:33,710
So it will be something like yes, yes, yes, no and no, yes and no, no.

58
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:42,320
And then the fourth column is a i b I see idea.

59
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:56,930
And this one RPI. The idea for the first table and the other pieces are less than Â£7.

60
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:10,820
So you can put your prototype into this and create a dataset and you can try to perform data to see to check your data.

61
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:19,020
And after that, you can also create the attack.

62
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:23,110
You can't use a fake statement to calculate or comment.

63
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:33,240
Also racial insults. So for this following course, you just need to put your training in the here.

64
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,910
And then your order, your data based on the level.

65
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:43,909
Appears in your date has stopped. And after how you use your cable statement.

66
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:47,569
And don't forget about the first paragraph in the paper.

67
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:52,850
Also, I shall be your study number and the second variable will be your role.

68
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:58,850
Role offer to about one table. So here we put magnesium in this outcome variable,

69
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:08,990
this patient's position and how we put a task role on the last position which refers to the columns float to back to table.

70
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:19,400
And don't forget to policy on this option so it can print all mental hands off statistics and will ultimately show results.

71
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:28,129
And, you know, trying to suppress all this place up two by two, table and all, and that's fine.

72
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:31,550
Don't forget your weight. The White House statement.

73
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:39,050
The reason why we can stay on here. Yes, because we input are the in cell counts four.

74
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:44,150
So, for example, using the word account statement.

75
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:55,910
If we look at our stack on line, it basically tells us that we are in catch 39 after being shown with magnesium.

76
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:59,620
Equal yes and that equal no. Yeah.

77
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:08,170
And once you run the proxy statement, it will give you a.

78
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:15,850
Mental health statistics, which is a statistic for testing for our treatment effect.

79
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:23,590
And also if you calculate a common ratio for mental health using mental hansell methods,

80
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:30,250
using inverse gravity method and also principal results for a homogeneous test.

81
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:41,950
So any questions so far? Sure.

82
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:52,680
And if you want to get a similar ethos in our church together, come out here and show you.

83
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:57,860
You need to. Download to podcast.

84
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:03,230
The first one has made how package and the second way is made how far package and

85
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:07,940
to download so you need to download make up package for older version to go.

86
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:16,850
Some studies specific also shall. So here are to function, we're all going to use.

87
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:21,680
So the first function as might happen function from a top target.

88
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:27,670
We're going to use my tapping function to calculate the mass ratio.

89
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:37,759
Mental. Time is up and first variance why it matters come odds ratio for another function we are going to use.

90
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:46,130
If are made to merge, we are going to use on average to calculate the mental hansol math of the come out ratio here.

91
00:11:50,780 --> 00:12:03,860
So so to do to calculate I'll come out the ratio in that your first need to create a bunch of factors here.

92
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:10,740
So basically here you just like create a fact herself and self.

93
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:23,150
And for example. You can see that I felt for each start for a sentence are these is equal to one night to 1/10 of one here.

94
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:30,590
So just basically put its values in to see function and separate each element with the karma sign.

95
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:40,760
So you first create a I factors for seven studies and I just create undo I feel I saw.

96
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:45,740
And after I you can calculate the odds ratio here.

97
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:54,110
And after talking about a certain kind of racial resolve value,

98
00:12:54,110 --> 00:13:08,419
just talking or I checked and you can find out w that label here and after I can use make it happen function from make up how much to

99
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:19,630
calculate inverse chance with common odds ratio and you just need to simply put a I on my I and see eye to eye into this function.

100
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:29,900
And don't forget to stop your method at inverse this argument and told are that that those are some very mysterious alteration.

101
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:38,340
And you're safe. Least off track into our after universe analysis and putting this out.

102
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:44,990
You will get all the results you want. So here's our results.

103
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:48,040
You can get a study specific, also racial here.

104
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:54,790
And you also can gather in restaurants, come out observational and homogeneous, attached to test results.

105
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,760
Any questions so far? Okay.

106
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:10,750
And to calculate the out ratio using mantle hands on method.

107
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:18,370
Another method is. We are going to use another function from a cow for a package.

108
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:29,340
So here we basically automate that image function and put all the AIB, ICICI cells into this argument and then print out results.

109
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:33,180
You'll get here. It will come up as a ratio for a mental on method.

110
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:46,040
Oh, don't forget to put the current equals false. So it will just turn off a continuous correction.

111
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:55,700
And so. Okay. Yeah.

112
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,810
But does it matter? Like, which function we use?

113
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:05,250
Like, for example, I used nitrogen for the rest of my life.

114
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:08,340
I don't have also calculus. So you don't care.

115
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:20,610
Yeah. And not just add this one resource we got him from we got from Baton Rouge.

116
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:32,760
Also, calculate the log files ratio for each study and also calculate a corresponding some sample variance for local balls ratio.

117
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:45,390
So we can basically use these values to construct our funnel plot because our y axis of our final plot is standard error of log ratio.

118
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:49,500
And while our x axis of log plot is.

119
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:55,660
Like all racial. So.

120
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:06,230
I will go back to the site later. But then I must go to the site.

121
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,860
So here's a quick review for a final part.

122
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:13,400
So how to construct a final top image?

123
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:22,370
So here's some basic stuff. So your first point to some of what we have said when starting your first need to

124
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:31,160
calculate seven on look at ratio for each study and they are central for each study.

125
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:35,960
So why does it calculate these values for these seven studies?

126
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:39,410
You can put it in PowerPoint into this.

127
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:46,620
Allen wasn't part of the point. You're not a part of a reference line.

128
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:52,140
I think probably part of reconciling you need to find God, starting with the smallest arrow.

129
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:58,750
So in our case, you can see that this one is the study work of smaller Thunder Arrow.

130
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:06,340
It has about ten areas, about 0.35 or something like that.

131
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:15,370
And so you need to part of rations like with path through the step halfway.

132
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:28,120
And then. Learning to carpool to come with us in Provo.

133
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:32,720
Oh, I like your program. 95% confidence interval.

134
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:38,720
One word result. One divided by 1.96 and one.

135
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:44,450
This one is water. Salt minus one divided by 1.96.

136
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:50,650
Yeah. Um, so Alcatraz here.

137
00:17:51,970 --> 00:18:10,770
Okay. So. Let me go back to our excellent show because we we run this function are amateurish and we've got the look of operational.

138
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:22,430
So we can simply put this chart into a funnel function to create our funnel plot and.

139
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:29,180
And before we doing this, we need to find a story idea with a small lesbian arrow.

140
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:36,680
And here we find a. Also, we found a I.D. with a small string arrow.

141
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:42,830
We we just plotted this index value into a factor.

142
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:48,290
So it tells out this graph and see if the smallest arrow found it here.

143
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:55,030
And then we just put this. Family wealth smallest general intimate reference one.

144
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:05,550
So you have to applaud for our. So and then questions so far.

145
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:13,460
Yes. So I'll go back to our chats.

146
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:21,100
This one. So so to create a funnel plot in south.

147
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:26,310
Here's your first need to create a dataset.

148
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:37,150
And here we could study. Study think I felt a one cell and see I fell and unto self here.

149
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:42,550
So. We can see that for the guidelines.

150
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:48,070
The first study, well, I felt is one and the other one size 40.

151
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:53,240
Just input these values. And before that they Thailand.

152
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:59,360
Don't forget don't forget to calculate the beyond self defense.

153
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:02,840
And this. Yes, it's a long log of all three.

154
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:07,549
Sure, sure. And actually, yes, start off.

155
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:12,950
Look at the ratio. Sample size is just a total sample size.

156
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:21,220
So why so crazy? I have said. So I'm sure.

157
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:42,410
Columns. Oh, I create another that I call Logan Paul's ritual.

158
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:55,100
And I set. The previous day I had accrued called my passport my make up that keep only me spare while this is a study number.

159
00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:00,800
Look I'm on social and they're starting to erode sample size and they're not privy to result.

160
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,440
So you can see that from this table. You can see that.

161
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:11,260
Ra ra mission is study with a smaller gender arrow here.

162
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:17,500
So it has 0.4, 0.41.

163
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:24,070
And, and the knock out version is equal to -1.0.

164
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:31,680
And you can't just write down these value and then we're going to put these values into next step.

165
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:42,720
So to create a funnel plot in size, you'll need to use PROC support procedure.

166
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:46,970
So just simply plug your data share.

167
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:53,460
And then. Change this x this value to.

168
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:00,280
Your minimum of luck as they shop.

169
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:13,760
So this father is simply just one. So this time per statement,

170
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:30,330
it's just basically you create this line with self one over 1.96 passing through the datapoint with the x with the zero equal to look.

171
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:36,780
That's how I know.

172
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:45,929
However, you just need to put a large alteration in the x equals here and then don't forgot to change

173
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:52,930
those so far to try these counter for that interval and then press a lot wrestling here.

174
00:22:53,940 --> 00:23:09,190
You also need to put those over here. And so from this part, we can see that we have formal timescales to investigate all publication bias.

175
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:14,290
So if there's, you know, any publication bias, then you can see that.

176
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:19,600
So therefore, you should be equally to sort through around the reference work here.

177
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:31,030
So it should be something like we have can study here the post and you should be 5.05.2 on the left hand side of our show.

178
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:42,370
However, if you see something like a we are so powerful, we have ten setting and like my starting point for on one side or one,

179
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:48,760
they have one for another staff, then they may be in the case of potential publication bias here.

180
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:54,380
So you can. This is how you interpret the.

181
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:11,620
And regarding your homework problem, one of regarding a homework problem when you are going to capital one ratio for each study

182
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:19,600
and you just need to modify add two lines to calculate using that previous call to calculate.

183
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:24,010
So here's calls for a funnel plot.

184
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:29,720
When you're creating that hashtag, you just need to add a confidence interval statement.

185
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:34,480
So this thing is supposed to calculate a lower bound of confidence interval.

186
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:38,050
And this is a problem of COVID, this interval.

187
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:48,850
And then after that, you can put another insult. Any questions so far here?

188
00:24:50,050 --> 00:25:02,480
Okay. Oh, and you have just put when you start another half hour, you can just put two variables here.

189
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:06,410
And I you will be another two columns.

190
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:22,880
If you want to calculate the study specific log files are showing there, you can refer to hand out to page 7212792.

191
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:28,860
And you can use a package actually you can use a function mate action.

192
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:37,640
This is a function from main to package. This is a this is a tadpole and not helpful.

193
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:43,040
So you kind of out your information from the package.

194
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:51,470
And here's how I'm reaching for Rocker.

195
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:58,340
So so also we have a title table than we offer.

196
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:03,079
And we also interested in two values.

197
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:06,770
One, we have sensitivity and specificity.

198
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:17,090
So sensitivity is calculated that I am divide by a passing and specificity of the divide.

199
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:22,190
Thank you. Guys are fantastic. Yeah. So.

200
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:32,160
So here's a simple example. Suppose that we have a study.

201
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:39,130
And. A new test was designed for detecting Alzheimer.

202
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:45,730
So the table below sum summarized the distribution of care score for participants.

203
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:53,439
So in our study you can see that there are 22 peoples scores.

204
00:26:53,440 --> 00:27:02,950
Test score one Alzheimer. Yes, and there are 73 people with test score one and Alzheimer.

205
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:13,990
No. So. For example, here we want to create an AR rocker based on four possible, possible thresholds.

206
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:20,880
So how to do this? We take this threshold as our example.

207
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:26,200
So for that, we use score equal or greater than for our threshold.

208
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:30,910
Then we can just create this table.

209
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:41,410
So in our case. Since we have no data, no person that have any score greater than four.

210
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:45,130
So if reducing this threshold, then.

211
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:49,110
No people will be classified as greater than four.

212
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:58,920
However, 269 people will be classified as squad.

213
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:07,920
That's an import for sure. And after that you can just park will show number of.

214
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:20,310
People with Alzheimer and sheer number of people without Alzheimer here and anticipated calculation tissue from this cell.

215
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:28,130
So in this tape, I can say that. Sensitivity is equal to a diva about a policy.

216
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:31,700
So A is this one. C is this one.

217
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:43,810
So it will be several percent. And to calculate a specificity, your theory is equal to 100.

218
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:54,340
And your pay is equal to zero. So you just pack these value in so you'll get the specificity equal to 100%.

219
00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:09,000
So anything any questions. Okay. So first you have for threshold value so you can create for tomorrow to table and calculate their

220
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:18,720
sensitivity and specific and you can adjust information so there is no value greater than four.

221
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,860
Oh, yeah. In your diet.

222
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:28,290
How fast? Oh, in your day. Yeah.

223
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:36,910
So it is not possible to know which ones are going to fall in those categories if you don't see that data.

224
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:53,420
Yeah. Oh. Of sarcasm.

225
00:29:55,430 --> 00:30:00,670
So that's your thing? Yeah. But there is no reason for that.

226
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:07,060
So. So why do zero and zero.

227
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:17,860
If you don't see the thing? Because we also want to understand the performance of this past one score.

228
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:26,110
Great. I'm not sure. However, with the not collect any date has not have any participants with score greater than four.

229
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:36,780
Yeah. Yeah. And so the last day that I answer her questions.

230
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:42,860
Do you understand? Yup.

231
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:47,870
I guess for the purpose of doing. And I'm always since it's zero.

232
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:56,400
But but still. I don't feel responsible right now.

233
00:30:57,870 --> 00:31:01,620
It is interesting that you has created the rough.

234
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:06,810
Yeah. So.

235
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:13,050
So back to our example here is sensitivity is our experiment.

236
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:22,970
Um sensitivities are f axis of rocker and one minus specificity for.

237
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:27,770
This one is our. A foreign park.

238
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:33,440
This is the Y axis, and this is one minus the shadow equal to our X-axis five.

239
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:39,110
So for each threshold, you will have four data points.

240
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:44,360
And just pop these for to have two of these points.

241
00:31:44,390 --> 00:32:01,760
So you can get out. So for your homework problem to ask the doesn't need to calculate the value and how many people for each Faso.

242
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:15,300
So to do this and to pop a cop, to pop a rock hard and stuff, you first need to just cried your it how fast.

243
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:20,920
And here we just. This is just me.

244
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:29,319
This week, 22 states, along with scores are equal to one and also home hunger.

245
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:35,380
Equal to. Yes. And then we repeat the stuff.

246
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:46,090
So we create 73 title lines with a score equal to one and of hunger equal to zero, and repeat that for each cell.

247
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:51,910
However, you don't need to. You not have a fat heart here for zero count here.

248
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:58,570
So you don't need to do anything about this one because there's no need to input.

249
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:02,649
And after that you just need to use parent.

250
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:04,870
We'll just have to pop a curve.

251
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:19,200
So you put y one here and use this arguments to create a curve and here you put your response variable so your data share voiced Alzheimer and specify

252
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:30,820
if one rushing in are one you start your phone you found of interest equals to score scoring is your dependent variable and you also outputs your.

253
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:45,200
They tap into rock resolve here. So after you run this, you'll get this rock and you can find the area under the coffee is equal to 0.8.

254
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:52,400
489 under this title. Which is very close to one.

255
00:33:55,900 --> 00:34:12,479
Yeah. And another way to calculate calculate the sensitivity and specificity for each household without using hand calculation,

256
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,320
you can just to refer to handout.

257
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:24,470
This is how three page 32. 32. Yeah.

258
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:41,820
And. So to do a raw curve in your judgment, you can download Pete Rock, this library, this package.

259
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:46,490
And after all, you can just create your date hassle.

260
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:51,760
The score factor is just basically like this one.

261
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:57,050
So you just you have 95 people.

262
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:03,050
With Score one. So you just repeat one.

263
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:14,750
95 times. And I hear you have 102 people with test scores, too, so you just repeat 102.

264
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:21,750
We've been to 102 times and this is your score factors.

265
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:31,950
We have six. And so after doing four, these four values, you can create a fixed factor.

266
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:36,360
So due to this factor, you just need to look at this column.

267
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:41,940
So you create one. One is Alzheimer.

268
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:46,319
You call? Yes. Sorry. You'll repeat, create factors.

269
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:50,430
Repeat one time, two times. And.

270
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:57,430
Four of 73 times and 177 times.

271
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:08,290
And so I think in cartoons here. So after doing your time, just like I was the first.

272
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:32,530
Rock responds. This is desperation, I cried out.

273
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:40,780
They have found. So that first column will be SCOR factor and the second column will be your Alzheimer factor.

274
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:51,970
And once you create this dataframe, you just need to run the rock function and put.

275
00:36:54,760 --> 00:37:05,110
Yeah, I think you can skip this part because that is going to we are going to use this to another function, but not this one.

276
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,830
So after you create your own factories,

277
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:17,560
you can use rock function and you just put your I used to fact her here so Alzheimer I saw response scarred back to her.

278
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:25,240
I saw her. So after that, you can just pop a rock resolve here and just knock it.

279
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:37,700
Yeah. So. So you can see the. Let me just go back to look at.

280
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:52,320
Well from our risk sample for stress hall score greater than four, we've got sensitivity equal to zero and one minus specificity equal to zero also.

281
00:37:52,860 --> 00:38:00,450
So our will pass through. One of a pawn was zero zero here.

282
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:07,160
And casting your aura. That's one.

283
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:15,370
For Walsh. I'll pass through certain pockets. Yeah.

284
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:29,800
And just as a quick reminder, when you are wrong, you are calculating us racial and you have found several cell counts in your study.

285
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:36,160
Then you need to add 0.5 to each cell for that study.

286
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:45,870
And so when you calculate come odds ratio using inversions, white matter study specific ratio.

287
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:52,990
Sure, I look also racial. When you start your situation, you need to at 0.4.

288
00:38:53,530 --> 00:39:07,710
Just a reminder. So before we have guys, tell me to fill in the feedback box for Rachel.

289
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:17,610
I can know that how many people are familiar with or have at least three, five or very helpful form.

290
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:27,290
Yeah. Yeah, I was the questioner at the OC for the question and the homework going out.

291
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:34,760
There's a threshold. Is it inappropriate to create a party for each one of them?

292
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:41,750
You just want one person. Are you doing it for her or something?

293
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:47,220
Yeah. I think you're traveling to quote one curve for all these far.

294
00:39:47,810 --> 00:40:00,050
Okay. Yeah. And I will be here for a couple of minutes to answer your questions.

295
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:44,480
School. But I said it's okay for me.

296
00:40:54,610 --> 00:41:01,920
But. I think the first question from an set.

297
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:07,810
30. They?

298
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:14,560
And then she was.

299
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:37,940
That's a lesson. Beautiful stuff.

300
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:45,030
Yeah. I'm just.

301
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:55,870
We can also see through.

302
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:26,460
Oh, yeah. Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
