1
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:16,060
To build on our discussion of the role of government in public health. Let's dive deeper into the role of local government in public health.

2
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:23,980
To help us explore this a little bit more. We've invited Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, director and health officer for the City of Detroit Health Department.

3
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:28,899
Dr. Khaldoon is going to help us think a little bit more about what local health departments are responsible

4
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:34,210
for and how they interface with the different levels of government to provide public health services.

5
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:42,910
Thanks so much for joining us, Dr. Khaldoon. Thank you for having me. So perhaps you can start to explore how local health departments are structured

6
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:46,420
and how your local health department is delivering public health services.

7
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:53,980
As the local public health authority, I have jurisdiction or authority over every resident in the city of Detroit.

8
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:58,930
So all 680,000 residents in the city, I'm responsible for the health of them.

9
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,500
What that means is whether there is an infectious disease outbreak,

10
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:07,930
whether it's making sure we understand things like infant mortality or chronic disease.

11
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:16,330
I'm responsible for all of that. Some of the services that we provide include restaurant inspections, actually oversee animal care control.

12
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,559
I have a communicable disease program, so I actually have epidemiologists.

13
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,040
So any reportable disease actually comes into the health department.

14
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:32,650
We investigate that by actually calling the person. We actually work with hospitals and local providers as well to investigate these diseases.

15
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:38,350
We also have things like a local maternal child health grant that actually comes from the state.

16
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:44,860
And that's an important point. Even though we're local, a lot of our work and our funding comes through state government.

17
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:52,989
So for local maternal child health, the state actually funds every county and for this case, Detroit as a city for that work.

18
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:56,530
And we get to decide locally how we will use those dollars.

19
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,450
Because like I say, just like in politics,

20
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:04,690
all public health is really local and the local authorities and the residents know best about what's best for their health.

21
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:13,240
So we're here in this clinic. Tell us a little bit about where we are and the types of local health department services that are being delivered.

22
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:18,010
So this is our work program. This is our Women Infant and Children's Nutrition Program.

23
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:23,680
So again, from it's actually a federal program and it comes through state governments to local jurisdictions.

24
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:27,940
We actually provide breastfeeding education. We provide actual food.

25
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:34,330
So milk, bread, really nutritious food for women and families all the way through a child's fifth birthday.

26
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:39,999
So when you think about how that directly interfaces with citizens in Detroit,

27
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,610
is the local health department responsible for direct delivery or is it more responsible for coordination?

28
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:54,309
How would you consider that services to be structured? It's both as the local health authority, I actually considered the local to be a system.

29
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:57,610
So it's not just a local health department providing direct services.

30
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:00,849
That's part of it. But I really think about the entire system.

31
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:06,250
So hospitals, clinics, schools, emergency medical services, academics.

32
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:10,209
So all of those various entities are part of our local health system.

33
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:13,930
So it's my responsibility if there is ever a challenge that we're all addressing.

34
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:20,350
So unintended teen pregnancy would be one of them. Sure, I can have a clinic here at the Detroit Health Department and we do have one.

35
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:24,310
But how can I work with my academic partners to understand the problem?

36
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:31,209
How can I work with my other clinics across the city, some of whom may not be able to see certain people because of an insurance?

37
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:37,600
That is, how can we all work together and collaborate so that we can provide services for the people of Detroit that need them?

38
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:44,680
The local health department is responsible for so much of the coordination and delivery of public health.

39
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:53,650
And I think perhaps what we might consider as well is how it's responsible for interfacing directly with the ten essential services of public health.

40
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:58,510
Specifically those related to assurance, policy, development and assessment.

41
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:01,900
Can you share a little bit more about how you think about those concepts?

42
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:08,680
Yes, a great example of how we at the Detroit Health Department work on something like assessment,

43
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:13,629
I think would be our hepatitis A outbreak that we're currently working on.

44
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:20,410
Right now in the state. The state of Michigan is in the middle of the largest hepatitis A outbreak in this nation's history.

45
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:27,450
And so what that looks like on a local level, every time someone who's a Detroit resident has hepatitis A,

46
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:32,530
comes directly from a hospital where they may have gotten the tests done to the health department.

47
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:36,219
And so we're able to assess all of those cases coming in.

48
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:39,520
And then when we get that case, we actually call that patient.

49
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:41,110
We speak to their family members.

50
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:48,100
We also work with our hospital and state partners so that we understand not only why that person may have hepatitis A,

51
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:54,430
but also understanding the risk that there may be in the community from that person and being potentially exposed.

52
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:59,500
So it's a lot of assessing what the risk is for individuals, but also the larger community.

53
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:06,580
I think a great example of policy development is in our work on teen pregnancy in the city.

54
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:13,030
A teenager in Detroit is two and a half times as likely to become pregnant as a teen in the rest of the state.

55
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:18,669
So we've actually to address this worked with our teens in the city who really know

56
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:22,660
best about what they know and what things they really want to learn more about.

57
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:28,960
So we went to and worked with a local nonprofit that works with teens and actually asked them, Okay, what are some of your challenges?

58
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:35,920
Why are teens having sex and what are some of the things you think we could do as the local health department to support them?

59
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:40,120
So we spoke with teens. We also spoke with medical providers in the city.

60
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:47,350
What we came up with was a teen led campaign called Decide Detroit, where we actually have our teens leading.

61
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:53,020
As far as the messaging around being able to have a choice as far as when they want to become a parent.

62
00:05:53,290 --> 00:06:00,370
But we also brought together 20 clinics in the city that provide teen friendly reproductive health services.

63
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:05,200
And all of that was built upon what our teens guided us to do.

64
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:14,460
So we're actually informing them, educating them, but also giving them the power to be able to make good, healthy choices when it comes to assurance.

65
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:17,880
I think a great example of that is our restaurant inspections.

66
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:24,490
Throughout the Detroit Health Department and many local health departments. We actually oversee all restaurant inspections in the city.

67
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:32,230
And so there are many laws in the local and state public health code that really make sure our restaurants are safe.

68
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,799
So we have inspections that we do regularly.

69
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:41,980
We actually have to make every business, even the food trucks are licensed through the local health department.

70
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:47,799
And so we make sure they are doing things like making sure food is at the right temperature or making sure

71
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:53,260
they're appropriately cleaning so that we can really make sure our local public health laws are enforced.

72
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:57,910
And sometimes, unfortunately, we do have to shut down restaurants if they're not safe for the public.

73
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:03,080
So if you move beyond the ten essential services,

74
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:08,540
then one of the things that I think is often common when we're thinking about public health is to

75
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:15,529
picture the large public health anchor agencies or organizations inside of the government Medicare,

76
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:20,660
Medicaid, Centers for Disease Control at the federal level, the state health Department.

77
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:24,650
From your perspective as a local health department director,

78
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:31,969
how do you see those different agencies interfacing with your work and how are you thinking about your

79
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:37,610
role in terms of ensuring that public health services are actually delivered on the ground to citizens?

80
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:42,670
Because at the end of the day, citizens are living in their neighborhoods and in their communities.

81
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,760
So I imagine your role is quite critical there. Exactly.

82
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:48,139
And that's really why I love local public health,

83
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:54,410
because a lot of these essential public health services or programs like immunizations or work that we talked about,

84
00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:01,520
those are actually federally funded programs. But the way those dollars flow and I think it's a good thing they flow from the federal government,

85
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:04,910
oftentimes through the state for many of those grants.

86
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,620
But then they come to the local level.

87
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:15,530
And what we're able to do at the local level is divide out those funds and execute them in a way that actually works for our local jurisdiction.

88
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:24,920
What works in Detroit may not work in Ann Arbor, so we have the ability on a local level to determine how we use those local public health funds.

89
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,690
I spoke about our hepatitis A outbreak.

90
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:35,540
I think that's a great example of how local, state and federal public health entities can work together because it's such a large outbreak.

91
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:39,860
Even though Detroit is one city in that outbreak, it also involves many other counties.

92
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:44,150
And so we actually work with our state partners and our federal partners,

93
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:50,810
whether it's investigating who else could be at risk if it's a person who may have traveled outside of the city of Detroit,

94
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:55,510
and then for some of those more specialized labs services, for example.

95
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:01,610
So if we get a sample from someone and we don't locally have the ability to run that sample in the lab,

96
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:05,270
we can either send it to the state or sometimes directly to the CDC,

97
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:09,559
and they have those specialized testing services to be able to help guide us

98
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:13,910
as far as what a potential causative agent is for that particular outbreak.

99
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:16,220
So it depends on how big it is.

100
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:24,290
Oftentimes things do start locally, but sometimes we work very closely with our state and federal partners, depending on what it is.

101
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:28,490
And certainly in an outbreak, we work very closely with our state and federal partners.

102
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,750
So moving beyond just the structure and and function,

103
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:38,330
maybe you can talk to us a little bit about what are some of the challenges that you see for local health

104
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:44,420
departments and what are some of the opportunities that are in the different areas that we've been discussing?

105
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:51,250
Some of the challenges are, you know, it never seems like we have enough money to do the work that we need to do.

106
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:58,210
For example, we right now are doing some programs or we're in the neighborhoods knocking on doors of people in neighborhoods.

107
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:01,710
Detroit is very large, almost 700,000 people.

108
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:08,110
It's sometimes hard to get the funding to be able to sustain those types of programs long term.

109
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:13,900
I think the opportunities are I mean, I have I live in such a vibrant city.

110
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:21,400
There are so many great whether it's our academic institutions in the area, our wonderful hospitals and health systems in the area,

111
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:28,330
there are so many programs and people who just care so much and are from the community, which I think is a very important point.

112
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:34,149
What we don't want to do in public health is think that because we have a degree or we may think we know something,

113
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:39,309
that we don't engage the people in the local community when it comes to identifying

114
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:43,090
both the problems but also the solutions to these public health problems.

115
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:45,489
So that's what I really love about local public health,

116
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:51,970
is that opportunity to work on the ground with local residents to identify and solve these public health challenges.

117
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:58,690
If you think about a career in local public health, what can you say would be the highlight of that type of career?

118
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:05,050
Obviously, students coming out of this program are going to be public health professionals and

119
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:09,190
perhaps working in local health departments or interfacing with local health departments.

120
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,820
What do you think is most exciting about being involved with the local health department?

121
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:24,520
I love local public health because you really are on the ground, able to really understand what the residents are experiencing and what they need.

122
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:29,830
I've spent some time in the federal government as well, and while it's incredibly important work,

123
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:38,830
sometimes you felt like you were so removed from the on the ground issues that you just didn't really understand how things would work.

124
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:45,370
So the federal government, you're often determining policies or you're saying that certain grants are available.

125
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:51,489
But here on the local level, I get to determine how that grant money is actually spent and I get to talk to

126
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:55,600
people on the ground as far as what they really need in their communities.

127
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,139
And that's what I love the most about local public health. Well,

128
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:06,219
thank you so much for joining us and for sharing all of your insights into how local public health is involved

129
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:11,020
in the structure of the public health system and how it interfaces with the different levels of government.

130
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:13,020
Thank you. It was a pleasure. Yes.
