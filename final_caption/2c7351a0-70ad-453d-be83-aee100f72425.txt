1
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:10,810
In this video, we'll
describe the problem of

2
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:13,254
adverse selection in
health insurance markets,

3
00:00:13,254 --> 00:00:15,070
assess the evidence, and

4
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:18,060
discuss potential methods
of mitigating it.

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,550
This video addresses several
learning objectives.

6
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,010
We will predict how
economic actors are likely

7
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:26,230
to respond to
incentives and apply

8
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:28,480
our typology of sources
of market failure to

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,125
healthcare to analyze why
suboptimal outcomes can occur.

10
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:33,850
Finally, we will begin to

11
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:35,845
assess the relative
merits of private,

12
00:00:35,845 --> 00:00:38,530
market-oriented and
public legislative and

13
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:40,780
regulatory approaches to improve

14
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:43,600
the performance of the
healthcare system.

15
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,720
Asymmetric information
and health insurance

16
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,519
takes two primary forms;

17
00:00:48,519 --> 00:00:50,830
moral hazard and
adverse selection.

18
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:54,730
Moral hazard occurs after you
have the insurance policy.

19
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:56,320
If the insurer can't observe

20
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,480
the enrollees
care-taking behaviors,

21
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,580
or the exact health status
and optimal care level,

22
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,010
insured people can take

23
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:05,860
too much risk and
consume too much care.

24
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:07,870
If these things
could be observed,

25
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:09,820
the contract could
specify the level of

26
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,995
care-taking and what
care would be covered.

27
00:01:12,995 --> 00:01:15,280
Adverse selection occurs before

28
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,050
the person has health insurance.

29
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:19,450
It occurs when people
are deciding which plan,

30
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:21,055
if any, to choose.

31
00:01:21,055 --> 00:01:23,320
People are likely to
know more about their

32
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,240
own or their family's
health history,

33
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:29,179
their health habits, and their
preferences than insurers.

34
00:01:29,179 --> 00:01:31,820
If an insurer offers
a particular plan,

35
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,740
a level of coverage
at a premium,

36
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:35,900
it may be concerned
that those who actually

37
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:39,470
enroll are an adverse
selection of the risk pool.

38
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:41,690
There's also a situation I

39
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:44,209
call regulatory
adverse selection.

40
00:01:44,209 --> 00:01:45,800
Insurers may be able to

41
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,945
observe important
predictors of risk,

42
00:01:47,945 --> 00:01:49,460
but are prohibited from charging

43
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:52,220
premiums that fully
reflect those predictors.

44
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:55,385
Technically, there might not
be asymmetric information,

45
00:01:55,385 --> 00:01:57,320
but the insurance
market will operate

46
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,480
as if there was
asymmetric information.

47
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:04,550
How might adverse selection
play out over time?

48
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:07,010
An insurer offering
a generous plan at

49
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:09,020
a reasonable premium may find

50
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,405
out that it's stuck
with costly enrollees.

51
00:02:11,405 --> 00:02:14,200
At renewal time,
premiums will rise.

52
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,830
This leads even more of

53
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,750
the healthy enrollees
to drop out,

54
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,975
causing premiums to rise
even more and so on.

55
00:02:20,975 --> 00:02:22,685
In the worst-case scenario,

56
00:02:22,685 --> 00:02:24,200
this dynamic process becomes

57
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:28,025
a death spiral and
insurance markets collapse.

58
00:02:28,025 --> 00:02:30,440
We might wonder
who's most likely to

59
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,330
be hurt by adverse selection.

60
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:34,280
To assess that, let's imagine a

61
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,295
counterfactual with symmetric
information on risk.

62
00:02:37,295 --> 00:02:38,750
That is, insurers know

63
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,365
everything their
perspective enrollees know.

64
00:02:41,365 --> 00:02:43,655
If not prohibited from doing so,

65
00:02:43,655 --> 00:02:45,020
insurers would certainly use

66
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:47,465
this information in
setting premiums.

67
00:02:47,465 --> 00:02:50,480
High risks would be offered
coverage at a high premium

68
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,710
and low risks would be offered
coverage at a low premium.

69
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,430
Now, let's compare this to

70
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:58,205
the situation with
asymmetric information.

71
00:02:58,205 --> 00:03:00,080
It's actually the healthy who

72
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,940
are hurt by adverse selection.

73
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,325
With asymmetric
information on risk,

74
00:03:04,325 --> 00:03:06,140
low risks are unable to find

75
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:08,135
premiums reflecting their risk,

76
00:03:08,135 --> 00:03:10,310
so they have a choice
between going without

77
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:12,500
insurance altogether or paying

78
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,970
a premium that forces them to

79
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:17,695
cross-subsidize the high-risk
individuals in their pool.

80
00:03:17,695 --> 00:03:20,180
To assess whether
adverse selection

81
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,385
occurs in real health
insurance markets,

82
00:03:22,385 --> 00:03:24,590
we can test three
implications that

83
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:27,229
should come true under
adverse selection.

84
00:03:27,229 --> 00:03:30,080
First, we'd expect a
positive correlation

85
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,730
between risk and coverage.

86
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:33,770
People with higher
risks should be more

87
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:35,960
likely to get insurance at all,

88
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:39,080
and choose more generous plans
if they do get coverage.

89
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,340
Second, bulk markups.

90
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,670
Those selecting more
generous coverage

91
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:46,010
should be charged not
only higher premiums,

92
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:48,740
but higher premiums
per unit of coverage.

93
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:51,770
This is an insurer pricing
strategy to guard against

94
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:53,660
the consequences of higher users

95
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,865
picking more generous plans.

96
00:03:55,865 --> 00:03:57,980
Third, in extreme cases,

97
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:00,840
we might also see an adverse
selection deaths viral,

98
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,410
which can occur if there is

99
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:05,165
no inducement to keep
low risks in the pool.

100
00:04:05,165 --> 00:04:07,344
In this worst-case scenario,

101
00:04:07,344 --> 00:04:10,765
some types of insurance
plans may not remain viable,

102
00:04:10,765 --> 00:04:12,340
even if some consumers would

103
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,140
choose them if they could get

104
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,760
them at a premium that reflected

105
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,075
their own level
of expected cost.

106
00:04:18,075 --> 00:04:20,725
Let's take a look
at the evidence.

107
00:04:20,725 --> 00:04:23,440
The evidence of a positive
correlation between

108
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,035
risk and coverage
seems quite robust.

109
00:04:26,035 --> 00:04:27,970
One literature review looked at

110
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:30,070
studies of getting
coverage or not,

111
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,575
choosing more or less
generous coverage,

112
00:04:32,575 --> 00:04:35,170
or choosing fee for service
plans which are less

113
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:38,560
restrictive on care authorization
or provider networks,

114
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,840
relative to managed care plans.

115
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,185
For all three types
of decisions,

116
00:04:43,185 --> 00:04:45,050
the evidence favors
the idea that

117
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,280
higher risk persons get

118
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,860
more generous or less
restrictive coverage.

119
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,580
In terms of bulk markups,

120
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,800
ACA exchange plan premiums for

121
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,110
otherwise identical
plans at higher metal

122
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:59,510
or generosity levels rise

123
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:02,840
faster than would be expected
if adverse selection and/or

124
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:07,290
moral hazard were not greater
in the more generous plans.

125
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:10,700
Finally, we can
also find examples

126
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,860
of death spirals where
more generous plans are

127
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,170
driven out of the market
over time as they

128
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:17,750
keep drawing more and
more costly enrollees.

129
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:21,170
In other cases, insurer's
anticipate this dynamic and

130
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:22,670
don't even offer very generous

131
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:25,560
benefit designs in
the first place.

132
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:28,520
What can insurers
or policymakers

133
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,905
do to mitigate
adverse selection?

134
00:05:30,905 --> 00:05:33,950
Potential approaches that
private insurers could take

135
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:37,060
include trying to level the
information playing field,

136
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,840
offering different policies that

137
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,510
induce people to
self-select by risk,

138
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,970
or selling insurance through
groups that had not formed

139
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:46,985
primarily as a vehicle
to purchase insurance.

140
00:05:46,985 --> 00:05:48,890
Policy approaches include

141
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,575
mandating and/or
subsidizing coverage,

142
00:05:51,575 --> 00:05:53,750
and running systems
that risk adjust

143
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,850
premiums or transfer
premiums from

144
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:58,040
plans enrolling
healthier populations

145
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,175
to plans enrolling
sicker populations.

146
00:06:01,175 --> 00:06:03,950
The most obvious
approach is to try to

147
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:06,140
level the information
playing field.

148
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,570
Insurers could, at some cost,

149
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:10,640
collect data such
as health history,

150
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:14,990
lab tests or fitness trackers
to better predict spending.

151
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:18,275
These efforts benefit
low-risk individuals.

152
00:06:18,275 --> 00:06:20,150
A drawback is that with

153
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,365
annual contracts

154
00:06:21,365 --> 00:06:23,660
currently low-risk
consumers aren't protected

155
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:26,600
against the risk of being
reclassified and charged

156
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,310
higher premiums in the future if

157
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:31,290
they were to develop a
new health condition.

158
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:34,160
Offering different policies may

159
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,560
induce people to
self-select by risk.

160
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,380
High cost sharing or managed
care restrictions are

161
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:42,250
likely to be least attractive
to the highest risks.

162
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,090
For example, a plan with

163
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:47,270
a high deductible or narrow
provider network may not

164
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:49,400
be very attractive to
people who expect to

165
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,970
use a lot of care despite
its lower premium.

166
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:55,250
Most private insurance is

167
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,600
sold through groups that had not

168
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,765
formed primarily as a vehicle
to purchase coverage.

169
00:06:59,765 --> 00:07:01,670
Employer-sponsored
insurance with

170
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:03,500
large groups is likely to

171
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,090
have a diverse but stable and

172
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:07,595
predictable
distribution of risks.

173
00:07:07,595 --> 00:07:11,155
Large groups also provide
economies in purchasing,

174
00:07:11,155 --> 00:07:12,785
and implicit protection against

175
00:07:12,785 --> 00:07:16,355
reclassification as long as
employment is maintained.

176
00:07:16,355 --> 00:07:18,620
Obvious limitations
are that obtaining

177
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:21,575
these benefits requires
labor force participation,

178
00:07:21,575 --> 00:07:25,590
and fear of losing coverage
could reduce job mobility.

179
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:29,590
The ACA created

180
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:32,290
regulatory adverse
selection by prohibiting

181
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:34,120
the use of pre-existing
conditions in

182
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,295
setting premiums
on the exchanges,

183
00:07:36,295 --> 00:07:39,010
and limiting the age
variation in premiums to be

184
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:42,710
substantially less than
the cost variation by age.

185
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:45,735
To discourage low-risks
from dropping out,

186
00:07:45,735 --> 00:07:48,670
the ACA mandated coverage
with tax penalties for

187
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:51,700
non-compliance and
subsidized premiums.

188
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,680
The mandate was eliminated
by the Supreme Court.

189
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,070
However, subsidies
have still been fairly

190
00:07:57,070 --> 00:08:00,220
effective in encouraging
participation by low risks,

191
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:03,460
but they are only available
up to certain income levels.

192
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:06,700
The ACA also included
provisions to limit plans

193
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,780
risks if they draw

194
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:10,690
a disproportion share
of high risk enrollees.

195
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,475
In other contexts,

196
00:08:12,475 --> 00:08:14,440
federal and state
governments subsidize

197
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,060
employer sponsored coverage by

198
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:18,550
excluding premiums
from taxable income.

199
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:20,410
This encourages participation by

200
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:22,265
younger and healthier workers,

201
00:08:22,265 --> 00:08:24,280
and the federal
government mandates

202
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,040
participation in the
Medicare program.

203
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,490
To summarize, adverse
selection can occur when

204
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:31,930
people have private information

205
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:33,670
about their likely use of care,

206
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:36,520
or when regulators restrict
insurers' ability to

207
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,505
tailor premiums to
observable risk predictors.

208
00:08:39,505 --> 00:08:41,830
As we've seen,
adverse selection can

209
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:44,560
impair the operation
of insurance markets.

210
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,990
Both private and
regulatory measures

211
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,400
are available to limit or

212
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,409
compensate for adverse selection

213
00:08:50,409 --> 00:08:53,570
with varying effects
and drawbacks.
