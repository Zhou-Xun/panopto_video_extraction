1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:11,760
I just counted on my heart and I said, Yeah, I feel like saying yes, I want to hear.

2
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:18,330
There are certain things that are really hard core economic success stories.

3
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:29,280
Yeah, this is. This is. I want to be able to get you on the contract because I want to work.

4
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,810
So she's 37.

5
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:39,620
What was that? No, it was last night.

6
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:54,480
But I think what's going on here is we just got a new general announcement versus average for today.

7
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:00,180
And then just last week, yesterday, if you e-mail me into, hey, the quiz is not available and I realized I hadn't activated it.

8
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:07,169
So sorry about that. So we do have a quiz. I set the due date of it to be Wednesday, so I will do that.

9
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:13,560
So we'll have two results on Wednesday. One are modeling and then one covering cost.

10
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:19,740
So I apologize for that. Too much action for you to get these quizzes done by Watson.

11
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:24,890
How are you guys feeling about quizzes? Easy. Too easy. Too hard. Okay.

12
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:34,170
No major industry. Also, next week I will be in Nairobi, Kenya.

13
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:41,370
So I will be teaching. I'm teaching via Zoom next Monday and Wednesday next week.

14
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:46,739
So I apologize for those of you who appreciate the in-person classroom experience,

15
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:56,709
but hopefully not a good hour also recorded so that I do from here and I also have someone coming here and hook up zoom so you can if you want to,

16
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:59,520
you can come into this classroom and participate in class,

17
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:05,520
in this classroom as opposed to trying to find some corner of it, you know, to do a Zoom classroom.

18
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:12,790
Any other questions or. All right.

19
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:19,900
So today we're going to talk about evaluating models. We've been talking a lot about mathematical models that can be used for policy analysis.

20
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:24,220
And today I want to kind of get into all of the details of how you might select different models.

21
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:31,060
And we'll talk a little bit about model types and then talk about how you would conceptualize a model.

22
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:34,000
And I think hopefully that's going to be helpful for your project.

23
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:42,450
But going forward, forward after, you know, after the semester's over, some of you might be involved in the cost of sales,

24
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:49,729
maybe help frame, or you might be the person asking for someone else to do a cost effective analysis.

25
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:53,530
So I think it's important for you to kind of a high level way to what you should be asking for.

26
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:58,840
Or you might be someone who is a consumer of cost effectiveness analysis.

27
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:06,730
And I think it's important to understand at a high level, you know, how are these being chosen and how are these problems being formulated?

28
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:11,740
And all right. For you to help me answer the questions I want answered.

29
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:18,780
Okay. So different model types. You talked about decision trees and more call models.

30
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:26,250
Does anyone have any questions about the decision trees in Markov models from the past week or two?

31
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:32,550
Yes, something we have Markoff model that doesn't have like of way flow or it's a have to be both.

32
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:42,210
Sorry. You have to have both way flows that we said. Yeah. Like I said, probably more technical term for that.

33
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,150
So that's that's a good question here. And I think same here.

34
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:53,590
Yeah. You just get out here.

35
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:01,780
So we can have alive and dead and like one way flow.

36
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:05,380
And that is a more bottle. Is that what you're asking? It doesn't have to.

37
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:11,150
Well, I mean, that obviously you can go back to alive, but like most of our models for like switching in and out of states.

38
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:17,290
Yeah. So in this example here. Yeah, you might be healthy and then have mild illness, but then recover and go back to healthy.

39
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:23,280
So you can have models that are really complex. You can have models that are really simple and they're all all macro models.

40
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:30,130
I guess what defines a Markoff model is that you have health states and you have transitions between them in some way.

41
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:38,320
So again, you could have again, alive and dead and I have two health states and have some sort of transition between them.

42
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:46,390
And so the reason we call this more cause is it's named after some guy named Marco from 100 years ago or whatever.

43
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:59,800
But they technically what makes it a markov model is that this rate here does not depend on how long you have been in this health state.

44
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:08,230
It makes it a lot easier to compute. If you if the rates don't depend on how long you've been in that health state.

45
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:18,280
Now, technically, if you've been alive for one year, two years or three years or four years or 75 years or 80 years,

46
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:21,490
that actually does have an impact on your mortality rate. Right.

47
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:25,780
A two year old has a lower chance of dying and a 92 year old.

48
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:34,330
So but oftentimes we make this Markov assumption that it is that that the length

49
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:40,270
of time you're in this health state does not affect the rates out of it anyway.

50
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:48,100
But for the most part, I think oftentimes that actually is reasonable that, you know,

51
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:52,510
if you bend if you got a mild illness for one month or two months or three months,

52
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,770
that might not affect the rate at which you develop severe illness or recover.

53
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:05,530
And we'll see later on. There are ways that you can if you want to, you can.

54
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,760
There are ways, even though when you start off with the Marco model,

55
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:16,630
but there are ways that you can make some adjustments to allow for the rates to evolve over time.

56
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:21,100
So this rate can be some sort of function of age, for example.

57
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,460
So the mortality rate starts off. Great.

58
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:29,360
And then age. And then it starts off low and then increased over time.

59
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:34,770
So you mean technically that might not be a hardcore model, but it.

60
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:43,820
Yeah, but you can. You can technically that the term might not be 100% accurate, but you can still build models like that,

61
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:50,569
which was also I guess I'll say if you think that the length of time in a health state does matter.

62
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:53,840
So let's say you have your stage one cancer.

63
00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:01,190
And you think that if you've had stage one cancer for one year or seven years,

64
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:06,590
it maybe it changes the rate and the likelihood that you end up with sort of stage two cancer.

65
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:20,540
You can you can change the health status and you can say this is like one year with stage one cancer and then second year with stage one cancer.

66
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:25,750
And you can move here, here, here.

67
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:33,620
So you can have this be a low rate and this be a higher rate.

68
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,819
So there are ways to kind of get around some of these limitations.

69
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:41,270
And I think there's a question on here. What kind of software are using for Markoff models?

70
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:45,140
So we've seen you can use Excel for this.

71
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:48,680
You can create more car models with our if you like.

72
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:57,350
And then there is this software that will that you see in the book called Tree Edge Software.

73
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:06,180
And for your projects. If you'd like to use treated software, you you can.

74
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:11,700
There is a trial version you can get.

75
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:18,810
There's there's like a student version you can get. And if you want to try that out, I'm happy to discuss that with you and help you use that.

76
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:26,490
I think this is something that's it's very specialized for cost effectiveness analysis and that kind of modeling.

77
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:31,650
And there's a little bit of a learning curve to learn how to use the software.

78
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:36,630
But then once you learn how to do it, it produces lot of nice graphs and charts and stuff for you.

79
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,680
So those are some common ones.

80
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:50,370
If you've used any use MATLAB software, MATLAB is very good for matrix manipulation.

81
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:56,850
And if you think about it, you have these help, these health states.

82
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:10,360
See, we have, you know, one, two, three, four as our health states and then there might be some sort of transitions between them.

83
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:24,560
You can think about this, that being a health state as being an A vector or actually let's call it A, A, B, C and D are the health states.

84
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:30,729
We can think of it as a vector, A, B, C, D, and is that all of us, that doctor,

85
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:35,980
with the probability that you're in a state ABC or D or if you have 10,000 people,

86
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:43,330
how many people are in each state ABCD and then you can define the transitions as a matrix.

87
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:49,960
This is the rate from A to a.

88
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:59,910
From be added. So this element would be a this element would be a B, so it would be a four by four matrix.

89
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:11,550
With each element here, this being from A to B, from A to B, it's been from A to C, D and so forth.

90
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:17,860
So you can you can define those transitions in a matrix and you can do some like you can do matrix algebra to calculate time

91
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:27,309
period one by multiplying the matrix times this you can get where the where you'll be in the next time period is anyway.

92
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:33,040
So matrix matrix algebra can be useful for computing results from from our model.

93
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,130
So MATLAB or something could be could be useful for this as well.

94
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:47,530
But for this class, you know, I feel like, you know, three quarters of the students will use Microsoft Excel.

95
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:59,260
And if you're taking six 5654, you might have some add ins for decision trees and those can be really helpful.

96
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:03,850
Excel at its for decision trees and we might use those again.

97
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:09,820
Or sometimes students will do so the right piece of software. Other questions.

98
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:17,890
All right. So decision trees, I think, are really useful if you know,

99
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:25,149
know it's really nice to describe what you're thinking about and you can capture the uncertainties with these kind of circles.

100
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:31,720
And then what happens afterwards? And then if you feel like you know what the outcomes are at the end of the century,

101
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:36,270
you can just define those as the cost of quality, just like yours and you're done. It's very nice and clean.

102
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,690
If you're uncertain about what the outcomes are at the end of your decision tree that may

103
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:46,690
be a model can be useful to simulate that long term evolution of what happens downstream.

104
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:50,950
So in this example, maybe some is healthy that has mild and less severe illness and then they die.

105
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,590
So there might be some longer term evolution.

106
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:57,820
Maybe we know the short term rates and we can use the more common to calculate what we think the long term outcomes are.

107
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:05,820
Infectious disease models can also be helpful mathematical models to think about the impact of policies,

108
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:12,210
particularly kind of public health policies where you're thinking about interventions for large numbers of the population.

109
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,660
We've seen this a lot with the COVID 19 pandemic, for example.

110
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:19,620
The interesting thing about this looks like a mark about health states.

111
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:27,720
We transitions that. The one thing that makes it different here is really that infection rate is a function of how many people are infected.

112
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,810
So as in this example, as more and more people become infected,

113
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:37,890
the infection rate increases with the number of people each day or week or month or year increases over time as we have more people infected.

114
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,690
So we saw that against COVID 19.

115
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:47,370
You know, there weren't that many infections in, let's say, early March 2020 because there just weren't that many people infected.

116
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:51,960
And then as more and more people were infected, there were more chances to transmit the virus.

117
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:57,850
So you have this non-linear growth that we've all heard about, you know, herd immunity and so forth as well.

118
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:03,660
So, again, with vaccines, you know, if one person gets infected, they kind of spread it to more people.

119
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:06,870
However, if you vaccinate someone here,

120
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:12,330
then maybe they might prevent some sort of chain of transmission in the right sense or multiplier effect of vaccinating.

121
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:18,450
Not only do you protect with some vaccines, at least when you protect one person, maybe you protect other people downstream from them.

122
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,000
So there's this kind of multiplier effect.

123
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,850
And when we're thinking about vaccination cost effectiveness, we need to kind of think about population effect.

124
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:32,310
I mean, if we're thinking about a vaccination policy for large numbers of the population.

125
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:37,880
And it really is important to think about the entire population dynamics of a disease.

126
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:47,420
And so, let's say without vaccination and 0% population coverage, maybe 80% of the population would be infected with some sort of infectious disease.

127
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:53,149
Now, you can simulate with these kinds of infectious disease models and say, okay,

128
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:57,740
if I vaccinate 20% of the population, that doesn't go down from 80% to 60%.

129
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:05,390
We don't subtract 20%. Actually, the number of people infected maybe drops even more than 20 to 20% of the population we've vaccinated

130
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:10,490
because we are preventing some additional transmission because we vaccinate people anyway,

131
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:16,639
so forth. So we can see you can use these infectious disease models to simulate what

132
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:21,290
will the population infected be for a certain population cover with a vaccine.

133
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:31,840
And you might find with the infectious disease model that you could find herd immunity whose herd of herd immunity threshold immunity passes, right?

134
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:39,620
Once you vaccinate a certain fraction of the population, the disease can't can't spread exponentially anymore.

135
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:43,360
Okay. And we can identify that with these models.

136
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:50,680
One other thing I guess I'll say here, so there is this really big benefit of getting close to that or exceeding that herd immunity threshold.

137
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:55,840
And so interestingly, we can. So this is the population.

138
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:59,610
In fact, it declines as we increase the population vaccine.

139
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:05,349
We can also think about what's the benefit, how much are we averting as we increase the population,

140
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:08,890
COVID vaccine and we can, you know, plot that based on the simulation model.

141
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:18,070
Interestingly, if we look at this, let's say we vaccinate 20% of population, we might avert infections in 30% of population.

142
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:22,240
That looks pretty good. But then you say, well, why actually vaccinate just 20?

143
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:30,570
Why do I try to vaccinate 40% of population? Okay, so now I've averted infections in 60% of the population.

144
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:33,790
That's really good. Okay. Another 30% or so.

145
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:38,800
Well, why stop vaccinating 40% of population and we should back at 60% of population.

146
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:44,290
Wow. Now, we've prevented your 75, 78% of infections in the population.

147
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:51,310
That's pretty good. Although notice the marginal increase here as I increase the fraction of population coverage.

148
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:55,840
I you know, I saved 30% of infections. I saved another 30% infections.

149
00:15:56,140 --> 00:16:01,180
Now, I only saved, you know, 17% of the population from being infected here.

150
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:09,340
And as I go up to 80% coverage now, I only saved another kind of 2% of the population from being infected and so forth.

151
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:17,200
So getting up to really high thresholds, actually, sometimes once I exceed that herd immunity threshold,

152
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:21,010
now I have diminishing returns to vaccinate more and more of the population.

153
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:25,750
Of course, all of this depends on how infectious disease is, what that herd immunity threshold is, and so forth.

154
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:34,240
But you can sometimes use these more complex infectious disease model transmission models to understand maybe there's a nonlinear effect here.

155
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:39,550
Again, if I vaccine one, as at the beginning of vaccinating those first few people in the population,

156
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:45,070
not only am I protecting the people vaccinated, but I'm protecting people downstream from that strike, this multiplier effect.

157
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:49,330
But once I get past the herd immunity threshold for every person I vaccinate,

158
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:55,630
I'm less likely to prevent an infection because we've already achieved that herd of new threshold that the disease is probably dying out anyway.

159
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:02,650
So there's some interesting nonlinear dynamics here about the value of increasing more and more and more vaccination.

160
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,229
And so for some types of diseases,

161
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:13,360
infectious diseases and some types of policies where you're considering a policy of mass vaccination or protection of a lot of people,

162
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:19,480
sometimes infectious disease transmission models can be helpful in understanding those benefits.

163
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,040
Those kind of nonlinear benefits.

164
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:30,070
Now, let me step back and say, sometimes you don't need an infectious disease model for every single infectious disease policy.

165
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:38,470
If I'm talking about should we vaccinate the class of 610, that would protect the people in this classroom.

166
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:46,120
But it's such a small population out of the entire university all our time and our road of the entire state of Michigan,

167
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:51,110
if we probably would need to build a really sophisticated, dynamic transmission model because,

168
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:56,260
you know, vaccinating this particular classroom wouldn't affect a huge population.

169
00:17:56,590 --> 00:18:03,580
Similarly, maybe talk about flu vaccination for two year olds. Well, that will protect them and maybe a little bit of their siblings and family.

170
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:08,620
But the transmission effects might not be that great if you're talking about vaccinating a very small population.

171
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:12,460
You're talking about mass flu vaccination for the entire state or the entire country.

172
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:19,930
Then maybe you should think about dynamic transmission effects. So there's pros and cons and different reasons for selecting production models.

173
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:27,880
One of the things I want to discuss about models is kind of cohort models,

174
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:37,060
where we think about a group of population and a in a deterministic way versus stochastic.

175
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:41,050
So one way to think about this is those compartments.

176
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,390
Whether they're marshmallow balls or these bottles here.

177
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:56,679
So you might have susceptible, infected and recovered. But those little bubbles, so you can think about them as bathtubs.

178
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:00,900
So maybe I'm susceptible, infected and recovered. And each is a bathtub.

179
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:07,020
Then how much water is in the bathtub? As how many people are susceptible, infected, recovered at any particular time.

180
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:18,140
And. The flow into the bathtub or the floor of the bathtub is like the arrows on our transmission diagrams.

181
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:24,080
And so if you're thinking about how much water is in this bathtub, you'd say there are,

182
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:31,010
you know, $33 or 72 liters, like you might describe it in a in a quantity.

183
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:44,510
That's a continuous quantity. Right. But you could also think about how many how much water is in the bathtub as individual molecules.

184
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:51,660
So you could say there are. 8,000,762 molecules of water in this bathtub.

185
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:56,130
And you could see that every single molecule of water vibrating around in that bathtub.

186
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:59,520
And that's kind of what a stochastic model is.

187
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:09,140
Is it is it might be an individual simulation of or it's called the agent based model where you're simulating individual people in a population.

188
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:15,930
And so you'll see sometimes there are individual kind of agent, micro simulations of infectious disease transmission where they're simulating,

189
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:21,240
you know, families and schools and workplaces and people kind of simulating all around between all of them.

190
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:27,210
And so that might be an individual stochastic simulation of the randomness of fire randomly cough on you.

191
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:33,510
And then there's a 30% chance that you get the disease when I call on you. So it simulates the it's kind of like flipping coins,

192
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:38,880
rolling dice and people going to work in school and randomly catching diseases and transmitting disease and so forth.

193
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:43,500
So you can have stochastic models or you can just have these cohort models where we just say,

194
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:51,500
well, 33.3 to 3% of the population is susceptible and 33.3% is infected.

195
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:57,419
And so we're not we're not getting precise numbers of individuals and nothing is stochastic,

196
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:02,910
which is that all of the tap here and we have one liter a minute flowing from this to this,

197
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:10,810
it's not random in terms of how many people are, you know, transitioning each type of.

198
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:20,040
So there are benefits and drawbacks of each approach of having a kind of continuous approach to these compartments or simulating individuals.

199
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:23,969
I would say typically it's easier to just have a cohort model.

200
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:29,490
And in this class, all the models like examples I've given you are core models where I say we have,

201
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:40,320
you know, I say like we have a thousand people and 30% transition each time period.

202
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:48,510
And so we'll say the next time period we have 700 people here.

203
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:59,809
And then I don't know what's. 200 sorry, 490 people.

204
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:05,750
But anyway, sometimes at some point here you're going to get fractions of people. So they're not discrete individuals.

205
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,100
And that's that's okay for this class.

206
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:20,360
We're going to have cohort models and we're not simulating the random movement of people and randomness of whether they get a disease or not.

207
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:24,800
But sometimes stochastic, I think stochastic models can be.

208
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:33,980
Let me step back compartmental are very are actually a lot times simpler than these individual agent based models.

209
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:46,580
But sometimes the individual models can be really useful. There is a paper from ten, 15 years ago looking at epidemic control and outbreak.

210
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:52,780
Where you might have, you know, 100 people infected in a small village in Thailand.

211
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,480
And can we control that?

212
00:22:55,510 --> 00:23:01,800
Well, there's a lot of randomness about whether I cough on someone and they catch the disease or not or whether they're cough.

213
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:07,750
I'm seven people and they all catch it or not. And there are different probabilities of outbreak kind of expanding quickly or dying out.

214
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:14,169
And so in some cases, that example, a stochastic model where there's kind of randomness of of what's happening,

215
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:16,000
that randomness might be really important.

216
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:22,570
But if you have another disease where there are, you know, a million people infected out of 350 million people,

217
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:27,370
the randomness of what's happening actually shouldn't make a big difference.

218
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:34,090
It's kind of like the law of large numbers issue here. We know, you know, next week there'll be another million people infected.

219
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:40,750
And whether it's 999,999 people or 1,000,001 people, it doesn't make a difference, you know,

220
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:47,170
roughly because of the law, large numbers that that that randomness is going to kind of work itself out.

221
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:50,460
And you're going to have about a million people infected with that.

222
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:55,090
So the government is giving you a kind of average number in the real world.

223
00:23:55,090 --> 00:24:04,750
There's stochastic variation and you might not precisely have if you start off a thousand people and about 30% transmission each month,

224
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:11,050
you're not going to have exactly 700 people. It might be 680, it might be seven or ten people and so forth.

225
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:17,350
So that's what's going on. This story has two models, and so sometimes you want to capture that randomness.

226
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:19,690
Most of the time, I think for cost effective analysis,

227
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:29,470
we're going to ignore that and just look at the average outcomes with the Department of Health or what, you know,

228
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:33,370
with all this stuff I'm talking about here today for your class projects,

229
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:39,639
you should build a model that's appropriate for answering your particular policy question or remaining tractable during the semester.

230
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:48,310
So maybe you're looking at something infectious, but you're not going to be required to build that a dynamic infectious disease model in this

231
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:53,200
class if that's not tractable or something you can solve in the course of the semester,

232
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:58,030
some of these models or again, a stochastic model, much more complicated and much more difficult to set up.

233
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:05,079
I'm not asking you all to do that. I want you to be aware of those as models. But, you know, I'm not saying you have to build one for this class,

234
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:10,480
build something that you can solve if you're a Ph.D. in epidemiology and you love building stochastic models that can stop you.

235
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:15,160
But but I'm not going to require you to build really, really complicated models,

236
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:20,830
but I want you to be aware of the kind of value of different types of models in your future.

237
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,259
Even if you're not building these types of models,

238
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:27,520
you should be able to understand what are the kind of strengths and limitations of some of these types of models.

239
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:33,070
As you're a consumer, if you're reading someone's study, you'd have an understanding of, you know, what are the strengths?

240
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:38,050
Did they did they use the right hand model? That's going to help me answer the questions I need to be answer.

241
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:44,140
And for your class projects, if you don't kind of pick the right model,

242
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:49,180
if you pick a model that's maybe a little simpler than that, it could be, that's okay.

243
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,640
But just acknowledge some of the limitations.

244
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:58,390
So you said, look, we we used a compartmental model and we did not use an infectious disease transmission model.

245
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:06,670
So we missed out on some of maybe the benefits of the intervention because we we didn't include the effects of secondary transmissions.

246
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:09,910
Just acknowledge that that's going to be okay for this class.

247
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,430
But, you know, for your again, for your features as consumers, just realize that, you know,

248
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:22,570
if someone is looking at a policy for vaccinating millions of people and they use a simple decision tree model,

249
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:29,560
then maybe they're missing some important impacts of that policy because they didn't use a dynamic transmission model.

250
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:39,860
We stop for a minute and see Americans. Russians. Okay.

251
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:44,480
So how do we conceptualize these models? Hopefully this next part of this is based on the one of the reasons you had for today.

252
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:47,210
So we're talking about conceptual model.

253
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:55,970
And again, hopefully this is useful for your class projects and hopefully it's useful also for you guys as consumers of these things to understand,

254
00:26:56,270 --> 00:27:01,820
you know, what are some of the important things that ought to be thought about and include in these models?

255
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:07,700
And so you can recognize, you know, what's a kind of good analysis, what's an analysis of weaknesses.

256
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:16,020
So the first thing here I want to point out is, I guess there are two parts here, kind of conceptualize and model, sorry,

257
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:21,140
the problem and then conceptualizing the model and then you can kind of choose the model side,

258
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:24,140
get the right data sources and kind of get your model output.

259
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:29,930
And you want to create something that's useful to your end users, the stakeholders, to help them make good decision.

260
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:37,340
So the first part of it is conceptualizing the problem. So you want to describe what is the problem out there.

261
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:42,290
So hopefully this is useful for you as you're thinking about your background kind of introductions for your programs.

262
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:46,730
And then what is your objective? So why are we doing this analysis?

263
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:54,740
And you can have, you know, many different many different types of objectives for a cost effective psychologist might be to guide clinical practice.

264
00:27:55,370 --> 00:28:00,230
So that might be let's say you're doing an analysis of mammography screening and you want to say,

265
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:08,570
is it cost effective to give mammograms to 20 year olds or 99 year olds or people with a history and a history of breast cancer?

266
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:11,930
Should we screen people once a year, once a month, once a decade?

267
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:17,060
You know, you can do that kind of analysis and it will give you some maybe maybe give some

268
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:21,650
guidance to primary care physicians who are making recommendations to their patients.

269
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:24,530
Hey, you should get screened this year. You should get screened next year.

270
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:32,540
You should get screened when you turn 35 or 65 so it can be used to guide clinical practice.

271
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:37,760
It's also cost effectiveness analysis can also inform funding decisions or reimbursement rates.

272
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:42,770
So there might be some new medical device and you want to decide in Medicare might decide,

273
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:49,550
hey, do we want to reimburse $1,000 or $10,000 or $100,000 for using this new medical device?

274
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:56,300
So you could do a cost of responses to see at what price point is this cost effective to, you know,

275
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:02,519
give someone this new knee replacement, also be used to optimize the use of scarce resources.

276
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:07,969
So and there really are some some very scarce resources like organs, kidneys or something like that.

277
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:11,060
There's a very long waiting list here in the United States for kidney transplant.

278
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:17,540
And you could do a cost effective analysis about, you know, which types of patients maybe should get priority for kidney transplants,

279
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:21,079
what's the most cost effective prioritization treatment scheme?

280
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:25,070
So that could be one of your objectives is to optimize scarce resources.

281
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:28,190
And then you can also be used to guide public health practice.

282
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:31,640
And we just talked about a few of those examples might be some sort of vaccination program.

283
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:34,940
Should we vaccinate two year olds, 22 year olds, 92 year olds?

284
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:40,700
You so you can ask those types of cost effectiveness questions and guide public health practice.

285
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:49,599
So I want to run through some of the best practices outlined in that in that paper

286
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,690
and maybe have a discussion about this and see if you have questions about that.

287
00:29:52,720 --> 00:30:00,250
So the first is that these models should consult widely with subject matter experts and stakeholders.

288
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:07,040
So if you're talking about influenza, I talked to some doctors who know about influenza and also stakeholders.

289
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:13,350
So talk to parents. If you talk about childhood vaccination, talk to people in the public health department, you know,

290
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:19,930
how would you implement this to make sure that your analysis appropriately and adequately addresses the decision problem?

291
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:28,089
So for you guys in your projects, I don't expect you to do a full blown interview,

292
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:31,750
50 different doctors and 30 different stakeholders in the community.

293
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:38,710
I don't worry about that. If you can, it's nice to talk to some medical experts maybe or some experts in the community.

294
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:43,570
You don't have to for this class. But keep in mind that that's that's a good practice.

295
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:50,680
So as you're as you're a consumer of a cost effectiveness analysis, you'll see.

296
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:58,300
Do we think that this model they actually did consult experts in the model really does adequately address the decision problem.

297
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:04,510
Is it incorporating the right parts to it? That's kind of something that we'll see kind of throughout the rest of this morning,

298
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:09,400
too, is the there should be a clear statement of the decision problem.

299
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:16,180
So what are we trying to address? Are we trying to address clinical practice or reimbursement rates?

300
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:19,480
And what's so what's our objective and what's our scope?

301
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:24,700
So we're just thinking about children in Michigan or we're thinking about everyone across the globe.

302
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:30,370
We're just thinking about 42 year olds. So what is what's the scope of this analysis?

303
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:39,399
So other things are the analytic perspective. So when I think about analytic perspective, to think about who is your decision maker,

304
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:43,690
who we're trying to communicate to what the value of this intervention.

305
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:49,210
So is this health system perspective? Is the patient perspective, is it a societal perspective?

306
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:54,880
So, you know, all these you know, make sure all these things are clear. Yes.

307
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:58,600
I'm kind of stepping back to like stochastic models.

308
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:08,199
Like would be like did you touch on like using like B like in Bayes Theorem or like neat naive Bayes or or anything like that?

309
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,890
Would that ever fall into models that we would use in cost effective analysis?

310
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:17,910
So, so let's see.

311
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:21,530
So well, first of all, I guess who here in the classroom. Merit based.

312
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:32,470
There are a few. Yeah. And but I think what you're seeing is like Bayesian and said what do you think like Bayesian theorem like if you're going

313
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:39,670
to do a stochastic model and you want to see like the rates of infection and how it flows in like a large population,

314
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:42,880
like a good like model you could do.

315
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:54,040
And when you're programing is using like Bayes theorem, let me do that at all and cost effective analysis to predict like how to predict

316
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:58,290
probabilities to or or is that something that we don't focus on is going well.

317
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:05,410
So you do use Bayes theorem in this class in in your decision trees, right?

318
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:11,709
I mean so we have, you know, this is probability of a happening and this is probability let's say this is,

319
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:15,260
you know, what is going to happen and then is going to happen.

320
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:26,020
Is this a probability of B given that A happens and then so that that brand, the probability here out of this branch here is probability of A and B.

321
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:32,260
And so you do you can use Bayes theorem for calculate things.

322
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:38,440
And actually there's something called flipping your decision tree. So you can, you can flip this decision tree around.

323
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:45,730
We have a first, then B you can flip around B and then have A happen next in your decision tree.

324
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:54,340
And you can use Bayes theorem to calculate what is what is the probability of A given B if, you know, probably be given a probability and so forth.

325
00:33:54,670 --> 00:34:00,850
So you can, you can use Bayes theorem to do some probability calculations in your decision trees if you if you need to.

326
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:09,020
Okay. Is that you? Yeah.

327
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:16,910
So going back to just kind of general modeling, though, you want to be very clear and actually as you're reading a cost effective analysis,

328
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:21,110
hopefully it should be clear precisely who is the target population,

329
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:27,920
what are the alternative interventions that we're considering when considering A or B or A versus C or A versus B and C?

330
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:36,230
What are that? What outcomes do we care about? So if we're thinking about, you know, a diabetes intervention,

331
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:41,540
are we considering strokes and heart attacks and amputations, blindness, you know, what things are considered?

332
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:45,830
And maybe that also tells you what things weren't included in houses.

333
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:53,150
Okay. This next slide has a lot of stuff on it, but there are a lot of kind of some points to that here.

334
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:59,090
So the scope and structure should be consistent to address the decision problem, policy, context.

335
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:04,190
So do we do we choose that decision tree, which is a markdown model?

336
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:10,010
And then if we had a decision tree, does it include the right types of branches that include the important things we care about?

337
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:14,120
If you have markup, do those bubbles include all the things we care about?

338
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:19,270
Do we have the right arrows that people can move from A to B to C and so forth?

339
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:22,500
The analytic perspective should be stated and defined.

340
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:29,300
So again, whose perspective is the societal perspective, the health care system perspective and so forth?

341
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:37,140
The target population should be defined. And typically this is, you know, is it is a Americans.

342
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:40,670
Is it people over 65, you know, and people with diabetes?

343
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:45,559
So what are the the things? And later on this semester,

344
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:50,000
we're gonna have a guest speaker Mark Fidrych come in here is great is in charge

345
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,420
of this value based insurance design center doing really interesting things, policy things.

346
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:58,790
I'm going to spoil this punchline here.

347
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:03,590
But when he talks about, you know, what are the most cost effective things and the least cost effective things,

348
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,800
often times those you know, the most cost effective thing is,

349
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:11,210
is, you know, breast cancer screening, the least cost effective thing is breast cancer screening,

350
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:14,209
but it's applied in different populations like breast cancer screening.

351
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:17,210
For some of the family history of breast cancer, it's very, very cost effective.

352
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:21,170
Breast cancer screening for a 12 year old baby is not cost effective.

353
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:26,780
So it depends on the population that you're applying the intervention to can affect the value of the intervention.

354
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:36,970
So the target population here, then the health outcomes, what are we what specific health outcomes are we measuring?

355
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:43,670
Are they are these health outcomes the ones that stakeholders care about and are they directly relevant to the questions we have?

356
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:48,670
So are these outcomes directly related to the choice of intervention here?

357
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,660
Okay. And then the intervention should be clearly defined.

358
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:59,740
So going back to like a mammography screening is are we talking about screening?

359
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:06,540
What type of mammography device? What level of frequency and so forth?

360
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:10,340
So to the extent possible, you know, make sure that that's clear.

361
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:19,400
And again, as a consumer of cost of this, I should make sure that the the person showing you the cost effective analysis is clear about what are they,

362
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:24,620
what are the policies, are the specifics of the policies there?

363
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:30,200
You know, thanks, I should say.

364
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:39,889
Also, I've been reading stuff about some some recent oncology cancer trials and there some oncologists

365
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:44,990
complaining about the some new cancer medications that are they're going through the FDA approval process.

366
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:50,120
They gone through phase three trials and they say, hey, look, this new cancer medication is better than the alternative.

367
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:57,320
But some psychologists are complaining that the alternative that we studied in the trial is like a treatment.

368
00:37:57,950 --> 00:38:01,459
It was great 20 years ago, but is not the current standard of care.

369
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:08,630
And so, of course, your nutrition is going to look good again, something developed in the 1980s that is not a good standard of care.

370
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:13,390
And, you know, these trials were done in, you know, in. And so they actually are claiming that, you know,

371
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:18,860
it's unethical clinical trial to give a control group of people something that's, you know, not the standard of care.

372
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:21,160
And so, anyway, you want to make sure that, you know,

373
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:26,720
in a cost effective or clinical trial that you're comparing against the best available alternatives.

374
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:34,540
So make sure that you're you're clear about what interventions you're including or populations you might.

375
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:42,020
And then the next thing here that is really interesting, it's related to data here.

376
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:48,170
And as you're thinking about these macro models or these decision trees or infectious disease transmission models,

377
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:55,040
you of course, need data for that as we're building a decision tree here.

378
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:59,990
Maybe I'll ask you guys. So this is my decision tree.

379
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:04,260
What how do I where do I need data for decision tree?

380
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:10,459
What kind of numbers would I need to solve a decision tree license probabilities.

381
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:15,800
Right. So there's probably two here, probably two here, over here.

382
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:27,060
So I at least need a p q r s what else do I need to change?

383
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:38,720
Any outcomes? Right. So at the end branches of these trees here, I need to have every single triangle here and here.

384
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:45,290
I need costs and qualities. I'm going to cost utility houses so I yield peak.

385
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:51,110
You are an s. I need cost and quality is here, here, here, here and here.

386
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:57,680
So I need numbers, right? I need data hopefully to parameterized those numbers.

387
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:02,550
And so data, you know, and these numbers are essential to calculating openness.

388
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:08,840
So that's a decision tree. But then a Markoff model. What what numbers do I need here if this is my Markov model here?

389
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:17,159
Well, I need rates right now. I need this rate along this arc.

390
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:20,459
That rate rates. Rate rate. Well, are.

391
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:23,850
One, two, three, four, five. I need half.

392
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:30,360
One, two, three, four, five. So it's a, B, C, D, I need three ABCD.

393
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:34,080
I need how many? What am I? Annual or monthly cost?

394
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:37,270
You know, one at a time. The unit is part of my costs of being in health.

395
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:42,000
It's ABCD and D and what is my quality of life?

396
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:49,770
If I'm in health, say A, B, C and D. So I need a lot of numbers to parameter wise and solve these models.

397
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:56,160
So data is essential to them all. But they're arguing here,

398
00:40:56,340 --> 00:41:05,220
and I agree that the conceptual structure should be driven by the decision problem or the question and not be determined by data availability.

399
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:17,100
And this is this is challenging because sometimes you might have so let's say I have some sort

400
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:28,050
of HIV treatment question and I think people are in HIV is not a good example here you can.

401
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:38,550
Let's go back to cancer. Let's say we have a stage one.

402
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:42,330
Stage two, stage three, stage four.

403
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:51,560
And, you know, people transition from 1 to 3, four, and then they did perhaps.

404
00:41:53,600 --> 00:42:01,999
And so if I this is my if I really think that this is critical to to solving my decision problem,

405
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,510
because if we're going to get people in stage three treatment and stage four,

406
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:10,339
treat B and maybe there's a lot of complexity here and I really need to know whether you're on stage one,

407
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:23,780
two, three, four, but maybe the data set I have maybe I have an insurance claims data set and I want and it only has well,

408
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:30,350
here patients who we know have cancer and your patients we don't who don't have cancer say this is no cancer.

409
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:38,780
And the insurance data set just has costs for people with no cancer.

410
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:49,070
And cost for people with cancer. And the insurance claim dataset does not know whether someone is in stage one, two or three or four.

411
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:53,630
So all my insurance, my dataset tells me is here's cost for cancer and prostate cancer.

412
00:42:55,260 --> 00:43:02,400
What they're saying here for best practices is don't limit your model simply because you don't have the proper data for it.

413
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:08,160
You know, try to create the model that you really need to answer the precise question you're trying to answer.

414
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:13,020
Even if you don't have precisely the right data to prioritize.

415
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:21,209
I would I would agree that if you think your your to answer your decision problem, you really need to break this up into state.

416
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:25,590
One, two, three, four. That you should know the model was safe.

417
00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:26,370
One, two, three, four.

418
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:32,790
Even if you don't have precisely the right data to say, well, how much the state one cost versus stage two versus stage three versus stage four.

419
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:41,639
I would argue it's better to just take this cancer cost of cancer data and use your own expert judgment and say,

420
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:51,090
well, if the cost of cancer on average is, you know, $20,000, I mean, my expert judgment and say stage one is 5000.

421
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:54,720
Stage two is 8000. Stage three is 10,000.

422
00:43:55,830 --> 00:44:02,700
And stage four is 50,000. You know, in consultation, you know, you can consult with experts.

423
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:10,590
And even if you don't have precise data, you could you know, it's better to use, you know,

424
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:19,880
lower quality data sometimes or expert judgment, expert opinion to create that analysis, even if you don't have all the precise.

425
00:44:22,430 --> 00:44:26,310
So try to build a model that answers the question you need to.

426
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:34,580
Anyone afraid? Any questions about that? Yeah.

427
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:40,979
So when we're making our expert judgment and adding these statistics or guesses,

428
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:47,730
I guess would we have like a little footnote at the bottom for our four projects that explains like how we drive that we got?

429
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:53,310
Is that how we do that? Yes. Yeah. Now, be very you should be very clear and transparent about how you got there.

430
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:58,740
Yeah. And and you seem to there's various kind of levels of evidence hierarchy.

431
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:05,170
Hierarchy and kind of near the top here are randomized controlled trials.

432
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:17,240
And then at the bottom here is expert opinion. And you might have, like, a single case better and then a case series.

433
00:45:19,570 --> 00:45:24,790
An observational study and a meta analysis is at the top.

434
00:45:28,050 --> 00:45:32,730
So even if you ran a randomized controlled trial, you can use some more on the pyramid here.

435
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:37,530
But of course, explain how you got it. Any adjustments that you made, what was your thinking as you got it?

436
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:45,550
And all of these analyzes should be documented to the extent that someone else I mean,

437
00:45:45,770 --> 00:45:49,950
they might have to be very highly skilled, but that someone else could recreate the work.

438
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:58,770
And I think in the world of statistical analysis, that's becoming more and more common as people say you should share your dataset.

439
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:04,590
So if you did some sort of you had this giant, giant dataset and you did some sort of statistical analysis.

440
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:13,500
Many people argue that you should release the dataset so others can replicate your statistical analysis to confirm that is really the right answer.

441
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:16,169
And for these modeling studies,

442
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:25,020
it's the goal here is that you should provide enough information that is so transparent that if someone else wanted to recreate your work,

443
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:28,319
they could so that you should kind of document.

444
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:32,640
How did you get there? How do you why don't you choose? But if you use 8000 hours or whatever.

445
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:43,700
And then, by the way. So people who disagree with you, they say that's the 100 orders is the wrong number.

446
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:50,809
It should be $9,000 or $200, whatever. And and actually, later on in the semester, we'll talk about sensitivity analysis.

447
00:46:50,810 --> 00:46:56,720
And you can vary some of these numbers and see does the court does the cost here at stage one,

448
00:46:56,930 --> 00:47:00,710
whether it's $200 or $700, does it make a difference to my overall conclusion?

449
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:06,950
You can answer those questions even if the parameters are off and I still give you the right answer.

450
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:14,880
Now going back here to Moore. Well, actually, before I got here, other questions.

451
00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:22,410
They just stopped me any time. So the next thing here are best practices.

452
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:27,630
Talk about comparators and time horizons. So the choice of comparators is really important.

453
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:31,050
So again, going back to an example of oncology,

454
00:47:32,010 --> 00:47:42,270
if you've got some new oncology medication and you compare it against something that was used in the 1980s but is not appropriate today,

455
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:50,010
that's an unfair comparison. You're easily going to say, Hey, this looks right when you compare to something really inferior.

456
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:54,000
What you should be doing is comparing it to the best available chart. Yes.

457
00:47:54,390 --> 00:48:01,440
So for those comparisons, is it the FDA that's purposely doing those comparisons or is it like the drug companies that are doing it?

458
00:48:01,530 --> 00:48:09,150
Yeah, so the drug companies will do that. So if a drug company is creating a new product, they will do the clinical trials.

459
00:48:09,390 --> 00:48:13,860
Now, they'll sometimes they might ask the FDA, what would you like us to do in the trial?

460
00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:18,960
And I would argue that's probably a good idea, because you want to because then when the FDA looks at it,

461
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:26,100
they're going to have to say, you know, is this a reasonable comparison or do you compare against the dog of a treatment that's this?

462
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:30,150
So it's not a good comparison. And we think you're you're drug maybe isn't very good.

463
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:38,010
And so you know you want to pick hopefully take reasonable comparisons that the FDA would accept our comparisons.

464
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:40,770
You know, there are some oncologists who say, though,

465
00:48:40,770 --> 00:48:50,150
the FDA is to be it and would like some lots of companies get by with that was a bad but for a cost effectiveness analysis

466
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:57,570
even if a drug company got FDA approval of what you think is a bad comparison in your cost effectiveness analysis,

467
00:48:58,230 --> 00:49:06,390
you should compare against the next best alternative. So let's say let's say there's drug aids from the 1980s.

468
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:14,150
Draghi is from 2010 and drugs a new one here is 2022.

469
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:27,980
And let's say the drug company, let's say let's say back in 2010, there was a comparison between A versus B and B got approved in 2020.

470
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:38,510
2010. And then here again in 2022, A was compared versus C and C was approved compared to eight.

471
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:46,860
But we think B is better than A. So for your cost effectiveness policies, you might have data on this,

472
00:49:49,290 --> 00:49:55,470
but what you should do is in your cost effective analysis, you should compare C versus B.

473
00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:02,340
Now you actually don't have a head to head. I hadn't had a trial comparison of the versus see.

474
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:12,060
But what that what we're seeing here is even if it should be concerned by data availability,

475
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:19,680
what you should do is do your best to try to really compare the versus see or see versus B, because we think B is the next best alternative.

476
00:50:20,130 --> 00:50:27,290
It's not a 1980s, but a B. So that's that's important.

477
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:39,110
And actually something to think about when when you are evaluating a cost effective analysis, did they really compare against a good alternative?

478
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:45,860
And that's that's just a just a like a general. We're making decisions.

479
00:50:46,130 --> 00:50:54,920
You walk into a car dealer, you say, hey, I'm interested in that minivan and sorry, because I'm a parent.

480
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:01,550
Maybe you like the sedan. Okay. So you want to produce. I want the sedan and the car.

481
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:05,780
You know, car salesman says, oh, man, walk in here. That's so difficult, man.

482
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:08,930
This car is so much better than walking. You should really buy this car.

483
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:12,170
It's better than walking. Well, no, you shouldn't be.

484
00:51:12,170 --> 00:51:16,729
Think about what you should be able to do. Very much walking. But usually. Why do I buy this car from your dealership?

485
00:51:16,730 --> 00:51:21,110
Or do I buy another car from another dealership you should be considering versus the next best comparison?

486
00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:23,300
Not versus something much worse.

487
00:51:25,170 --> 00:51:30,150
Similar to the airline selling your ticket to fly to Chicago and saying, oh, our flight, so much better to walking to Chicago.

488
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:34,200
Well, no, you're not comparing against comparing, you know, Delta versus United.

489
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:40,350
And so you want to you want to compare against the next best alternative. Okay.

490
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:46,570
So again, you want to you want to make sure that you're comparing against a good alternative strategy.

491
00:51:46,590 --> 00:51:50,879
And and that's something to kind of keep your feelers up for as you're reading a cost effective

492
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:58,290
analysis is did they really compare against a good alternative or set of alternatives?

493
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:02,640
Because it's easy to make something look good if you compare against something really bad.

494
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:12,760
Yeah. But I think here's what time horizon going to make sure the time horizon captures all the relevant differences in outcomes.

495
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:17,860
And I guess one important thing to have is differences in outcomes.

496
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:21,940
So typically, let's say we have a decision tree here, we can very see versus B,

497
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:29,410
the key thing here in any kind of decision really is what is the difference between my two alternatives?

498
00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:34,959
So what is going to be different between see and be there? You know, there are a lot of different outcomes,

499
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:41,020
but what are the key outcomes that are different in B and C and over what time frame are we going to see those outcomes?

500
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:51,810
So let's say we have two vaccines with equivalent effectiveness, but they have different side effect profiles and maybe the side effects affect you.

501
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:58,000
You know, one, it really hurts my arm a lot for a week and one hurts my arm a little bit for two weeks.

502
00:52:58,540 --> 00:53:04,569
Well, then my time horizon maybe should just be a couple of weeks because I really think is different between the two vaccines is how

503
00:53:04,570 --> 00:53:12,219
sore my arm is over those two weeks so that I might just need a short time period to evaluate the value of vaccine versus vaccine.

504
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:17,110
B But if there's something else like let's say,

505
00:53:18,130 --> 00:53:26,080
let's say someone has come up with a universal coronavirus vaccine that we think is going to last for and protect you for 40 years.

506
00:53:27,130 --> 00:53:27,340
Well,

507
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:35,470
then you might need a 40 year time horizon to evaluate the value of that universal coronavirus vaccine because it's going to protect you for decades.

508
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:49,780
Any questions? One of the things they mentioned here that will be difficult to do in your class projects,

509
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:55,540
but something for you to think about is you're a consumer of these analyzes here is that this problem situation

510
00:53:55,720 --> 00:54:02,320
conceptualization should identify key uncertainties in the model structure where sensitivity analysis can inform their impact.

511
00:54:02,380 --> 00:54:06,760
So so think about the structure.

512
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:15,880
And was the model structured properly? Did they include all the right branches of uncertainty in their in their decision tree?

513
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:21,550
Did they include all the right health states in their Markov model?

514
00:54:23,050 --> 00:54:32,890
And if you think that they are, then sometimes what you can do in some sort of policy analysis is you can try an alternative structure.

515
00:54:32,890 --> 00:54:37,390
We could say, okay, we modeled it this way with three health states and we model the same way for health states.

516
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:39,370
And then did you get a different answer?

517
00:54:39,370 --> 00:54:46,029
So you can it is possible to do some kind of structural sensitivity analysis and try things with several different structures.

518
00:54:46,030 --> 00:54:49,659
You can say, well, we did this as a decision tree and got this answer we did as a market model.

519
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:52,299
We got this answer. You get the same answer both times.

520
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:59,740
That suggests you're still getting your answers revised, but that's something sometimes you can do.

521
00:54:59,740 --> 00:55:03,790
You don't always have to do that. It's actually pretty rare to actually do that.

522
00:55:03,790 --> 00:55:13,569
But that's something. A thing or two is how the structure effective outcomes and at least you can just discuss how

523
00:55:13,570 --> 00:55:18,399
you think the structure went down even if you don't have the time effort to build a model.

524
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:27,340
And they're saying here is about the policy context.

525
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:32,950
This is also something to think about for your introduction sections of your writing right now.

526
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:39,759
So the policy context be clearly stated. So who is your policy audience?

527
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:46,540
Who do you think is going to be making the decision that this analysis might be relevant and for published,

528
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:53,080
cost effective policies that you might be reading the new consumer? Think about who is the, you know, the funder and developer of this.

529
00:55:54,510 --> 00:55:56,559
You know, academics oftentimes do these things.

530
00:55:56,560 --> 00:56:06,190
And so they're they're they actually might face some biases being part of academic institutions and they might get funding from corporate clients.

531
00:56:06,190 --> 00:56:14,110
I have done some work. I'm actually currently working on a project with an organization that's working for a medical device company.

532
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:16,920
And and so we're helping them do a cost response.

533
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:21,070
But, you know, when you read that paper, when it finally gets published, you know, you should acknowledge that,

534
00:56:21,370 --> 00:56:24,489
hey, look, I and some of the people on our team, we're funded by that organization.

535
00:56:24,490 --> 00:56:27,430
And sometimes that can introduce bias. We should be aware of that.

536
00:56:29,510 --> 00:56:35,739
You know, and oftentimes there are people who work for pharmaceutical companies who are we're very talented, huge and very good.

537
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:41,670
And, you know, and we'll do a cost to our consultants for their new drug, for their companies.

538
00:56:42,490 --> 00:56:47,290
So that's something to be aware of. I would say, you know, most of the time those are very good analysis.

539
00:56:47,290 --> 00:56:50,830
But you should you should be aware that there's obviously natural bias there.

540
00:56:51,550 --> 00:56:52,930
I think late on this semester, will,

541
00:56:52,930 --> 00:56:58,690
we'll see an example of someone who's looked at kind of systematically a bunch of cost effectiveness analysis in the literature.

542
00:56:58,990 --> 00:57:02,110
And surprise, surprise, they find ones that are funded by industry,

543
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:08,560
oftentimes have lower cost effects ratios or find the interventions to be more cost effective than ones not funded by so.

544
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:15,790
So anyways. But that should all be hopefully transparently clear. So as a reader you can maybe, if you feel it's appropriate,

545
00:57:16,030 --> 00:57:24,730
apply extra scrutiny to those analysis if you think there might be something which implies, okay, any questions?

546
00:57:28,230 --> 00:57:33,420
So conceptualizing these models here. So again, the best practice we talked about earlier,

547
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:40,410
kind of expert consultations can be helpful to convert the problem into an appropriate model structure.

548
00:57:41,390 --> 00:57:45,360
I'm going to ensuring that insurance reflects Guernsey's Knowledge and the process model.

549
00:57:46,350 --> 00:57:55,710
And any you seen an influence diagram before any influence variables, relevance diagram decision diagram might be useful which virtually yes.

550
00:57:56,490 --> 00:58:06,730
Going to tell us what they're if you remember when this happens, is it like the one the next looks.

551
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:09,930
Yes. Yeah.

552
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:23,910
So I've done a influenced diagram, decision diagram, elephants diagram can be helpful and in kind of communicating an idea of what you're considering.

553
00:58:24,330 --> 00:58:29,040
And I think in some ways it's similar to Decision Tree or it's a way to

554
00:58:32,190 --> 00:58:35,120
simplify a decision tree and communicate your ideas about what you're thinking.

555
00:58:35,130 --> 00:58:42,330
So let's say we have a decision here and we're going to consider, you know, do you get a vaccine or not?

556
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:50,429
And then we're going to get infected or not.

557
00:58:50,430 --> 00:58:57,509
And then you get do you go to see the doctor or not?

558
00:58:57,510 --> 00:59:05,819
And then you go to the hospital or not. And then if you're in the hospital, you go to the ICU or not and then you die or not.

559
00:59:05,820 --> 00:59:13,559
So we get a lot of branches. And notice here I explicitly not draw up the entire tree because then we have, you know, a bazillion branches here.

560
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:22,690
And again, I'll fill up and really clutter. A decision diagram would just would not show all the branches.

561
00:59:22,690 --> 00:59:24,700
But I'd say I'm going to have a decision about vaccination.

562
00:59:26,290 --> 00:59:32,769
And that vaccination decision is going to affect whether I get infected and then whether I get infected.

563
00:59:32,770 --> 00:59:38,980
It will affect whether I see the doctor and then whether I see the doctor will affect whether I'm hospitalized

564
00:59:39,430 --> 00:59:46,750
and then whether hospitalized it will affect my when I am in ICU and all that will affect whether I die.

565
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:56,020
And you can draw a bunch of arrows about. So whether I even if I don't go to ICU, whether I'm hospitalized can affect whether I die.

566
00:59:56,410 --> 01:00:07,420
And I can also say I care about costs and quality of life and whether I die affects my quality of life.

567
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:10,480
ICU affects my cost, hospitalization affects my cost.

568
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:15,190
If I see the doctor affects my cost, my possible effects, my five ICU affects my quality of life.

569
01:00:15,490 --> 01:00:22,360
Now, I'm not showing a big, huge decision drawing diagram here or I'm not showing on the decision tree with every single branch.

570
01:00:22,690 --> 01:00:28,060
But at least with this influenced diagram or decision, I'm communicating what things are related to each other.

571
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:31,030
Actually, if I'm infected, that probably affects my point of life as well.

572
01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:36,250
So you can you can show what things I think are connected to each other, are related to each other.

573
01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:42,310
This kind of looks like a macaque model, but it's not a markup. It's just showing what things are related to each other.

574
01:00:42,970 --> 01:00:47,920
And so, yeah, so this is an influence diagram.

575
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:51,940
It helps kind of community. And again, it can be helpful when you talk to experts, you know,

576
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:59,559
what are the things that are most important that affect costs of quality of life and what things are related to each other?

577
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:04,490
So which then can influence which other things? Which things are relevant to other things.

578
01:01:07,660 --> 01:01:15,730
So yeah, they're interested in more that influence diagrams can be a useful concept to help mediate within your team or with an expert.

579
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:18,249
Now, here are the things we think we're thinking about,

580
01:01:18,250 --> 01:01:22,510
and these are the things we think are connected to each other, related to each other, or influence each other.

581
01:01:32,150 --> 01:01:38,240
The lesson here is that several model types might be suitable. Some problems are naturally represented by some other types of others.

582
01:01:39,170 --> 01:01:45,770
So I want to just highlight a few things here. When you think about model selection here, you can think about the individual versus the group.

583
01:01:45,770 --> 01:01:53,270
Are we going to see individuals or groups that's kind of casting individuals, age based models or models,

584
01:01:53,900 --> 01:01:56,960
and then think about the interactions between individuals, other components of the model.

585
01:01:57,290 --> 01:02:03,859
So like an infectious disease model, the interaction of intrinsic individuals is important for some other things.

586
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:07,009
Like, you know, do I take my stands for our disease?

587
01:02:07,010 --> 01:02:09,770
That affects me but maybe doesn't affect I don't interact with other people.

588
01:02:09,830 --> 01:02:14,450
I might do simpler and then think of the time horizon and the time measurement.

589
01:02:14,450 --> 01:02:17,690
Is this something that's happening like a coronavirus? I might have.

590
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:24,620
I have daily cycles of think what was happening day by day with cancer, maybe by month,

591
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:33,200
with human papillomavirus, maybe takes years and decades to progress to actually return with cancer.

592
01:02:35,690 --> 01:02:40,400
So first kind of simple models with special characteristics, very short time horizons.

593
01:02:41,050 --> 01:02:48,260
A decision tree might be appropriate if some sort of problem represents a disease or some sort

594
01:02:48,260 --> 01:02:54,080
of process that some sort of evolution of health states over time of how models can be useful.

595
01:02:55,100 --> 01:02:59,929
Now they say here in the primer, one of the disadvantage of these is Marconi.

596
01:02:59,930 --> 01:03:03,140
An assumption of the transmission rates are constant over time.

597
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:13,100
So that can be addressed here. And individual say transmission models can be used to to to address closing as well.

598
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:21,650
And then with the interactions, then we should make sure you pick models that include those interactions like infectious disease transmission models.

599
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:27,410
One more thing about the Marconi and assumption of transmission or sorry,

600
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:33,750
transitions that I've used, for example, sometimes is related to transplantation.

601
01:03:33,770 --> 01:03:41,960
So let's say we have someone with end stage renal disease or kidney failure, and they might get transplant.

602
01:03:48,810 --> 01:03:52,860
And remember with these. And then, of course, at any point someone might die.

603
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:58,530
So let's say we have a simple model like this and.

604
01:04:02,010 --> 01:04:05,280
For each of these to say this model here we need a red.

605
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:08,939
Here are one or two or three.

606
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:14,610
So we have different rates. And then for each different health state, we have costs and qualities.

607
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:24,640
Associated with that. Now, I don't know how much you guys know about transportation, but what might be a problem with this is Marco Polo.

608
01:04:24,730 --> 01:04:28,270
We have no real disease. People getting transplants and dying.

609
01:04:28,810 --> 01:04:33,160
That might be related to Marco assumption about the length of time and how it affects your.

610
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:40,910
Right now we're assuming if you had any stage renal disease for one year or 20 years, it's the same rates and costs and quality.

611
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:47,140
Same thing with transplant, maybe a problem with with that.

612
01:04:49,030 --> 01:04:53,860
So maybe a little bit of an obscure question. Settlements, acceptance of the organ.

613
01:04:54,460 --> 01:05:00,190
So the acceptance of the organ might change. Yeah. So if you've had any stage renal disease for one year or two years or ten years,

614
01:05:00,430 --> 01:05:05,010
this rate might be different because you might have different chance of being offered organs.

615
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:10,570
Yeah, I don't know if this is quite relevant, but once you get the transplants are costs are going to go way down.

616
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:19,629
Right. So one so interestingly, a transplant itself might be depends on kidney transplant, maybe $50,000 like that.

617
01:05:19,630 --> 01:05:22,690
So expensive. But but and stage renal disease expensive.

618
01:05:23,350 --> 01:05:27,700
Right. That's that's, you know, 80, $80,000 a year or something like that.

619
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:31,870
And after you get that kidney so that the transplant itself is expensive,

620
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:37,450
but then a year after you've got a properly functioning kidney transplant graft.

621
01:05:38,140 --> 01:05:42,550
Now you have to take anti-rejection medicines for free, but it's a much lower cost.

622
01:05:43,030 --> 01:05:49,900
The next year, after you get the transplant and your chance of dying in the first year when your

623
01:05:49,910 --> 01:05:53,110
transplant is kind of high because you went through a major medical procedure.

624
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:57,340
But the chance of dying the next year isn't quite as bad in the next year with quite as bad.

625
01:05:57,580 --> 01:06:01,960
And so what you can do if you think that's that's an important distinction.

626
01:06:05,230 --> 01:06:15,420
For me as well is you can build a slightly different model so you can have end stage renal disease transplant dead.

627
01:06:16,270 --> 01:06:26,450
You say this is transplant, you're one. And then if you survive that year, you go to transplant your two plus.

628
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:31,970
You have a lower rate of dying.

629
01:06:32,270 --> 01:06:41,480
If you survive that first year and your costs might be really, really high that first year because you had a big, you know,

630
01:06:41,570 --> 01:06:48,110
major medical procedure, you stay in the hospital for a while recovering, but transplant your to a plus, your costs might be lower.

631
01:06:48,770 --> 01:06:54,470
Maybe you only have $10,000 in costs versus a hundred thousand, you know, maybe a $100,000 in costs this year.

632
01:06:54,920 --> 01:07:02,210
But then you're only $10,000 every year thereafter. So you can kind of split up that health state of transplant into two health states.

633
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:05,600
Transplant is one where it's intense, very expensive.

634
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:10,520
Maybe quality of life is low because you just went through this procedure and maybe your risk of dying

635
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:14,780
is higher because you might have got an infection during the transplant procedure or it just had,

636
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:21,110
you know, Major, you died on the table from the AC Jackson or something like that, right?

637
01:07:21,110 --> 01:07:23,839
So maybe higher rate of dying here or it might hurt.

638
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:31,940
So if transplant in your two and your three and your four, is quality and quantity different from that first year of your transplant?

639
01:07:32,090 --> 01:07:35,520
You can separate those interesting number. Yes. Yes.

640
01:07:35,650 --> 01:07:43,540
So I am an old project that we're we actually we're charged with implementing our risk assessment models for that use our DX,

641
01:07:44,030 --> 01:07:49,879
you know, payments for Medicare. So this is kind of what we have to do where we cover, you know, out this isn't true so much.

642
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:56,270
But in the model there was like a 4 to 9 months post-transplant group and then a ten plus because the prices were way different.

643
01:07:56,270 --> 01:08:03,139
So when you combine that data, all she did in one model, then it wouldn't really be, you know, kind of best with the pricing scheme.

644
01:08:03,140 --> 01:08:07,340
So you had to separate about that months and that was kind of an arbitrary cut off of months.

645
01:08:07,340 --> 01:08:11,210
But you kind of been aware of people, right?

646
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:15,229
Post-transplant are a lot different from ten plus months, you know, and so many years beyond.

647
01:08:15,230 --> 01:08:20,180
So yeah, so it's important in for for some types of questions.

648
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:24,739
It's important to break those things up and say, okay, look,

649
01:08:24,740 --> 01:08:32,480
we realize someone in the first three months after their transplant is different from 4 to 9 months and then ten plus months is the you know,

650
01:08:32,510 --> 01:08:37,700
the costs change. And so maybe the reimbursement needs to change to the providers on those

651
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:42,170
different times because maybe the treatment is declines in intensity over time.

652
01:08:42,410 --> 01:08:47,780
And you can you can use data sets to understand where, you know, roughly,

653
01:08:47,780 --> 01:08:52,630
should we make those breakpoints and what are the the costs and risks in the different time periods,

654
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:58,400
you know, so anyway, you can and this is a model this is a model choice.

655
01:08:59,030 --> 01:09:02,030
There's a lot of art and science to doing these analysis.

656
01:09:02,030 --> 01:09:06,830
The science might be, you know, in the data set and seeing how do those costs change over time.

657
01:09:07,580 --> 01:09:10,340
But the art of it is deciding, you know, where do we put the breakpoints?

658
01:09:10,940 --> 01:09:13,879
You probably see, you know, the cost curve probably looks something like this.

659
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:18,200
And the question is, well, do we break it up into this time period, in this time period, in this time period?

660
01:09:18,830 --> 01:09:22,180
Or how do you where do you make the break?

661
01:09:22,190 --> 01:09:29,899
Once there's that's an art to it. There's not necessarily a right. So we break this up into your one and your two plus or your one year, two year,

662
01:09:29,900 --> 01:09:34,400
three month, one month to month, three, one, two, three, four, three, nine, ten plus.

663
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:41,390
That's all in some judgment, human judgment that we can create these models.

664
01:09:47,670 --> 01:09:55,890
Other questions. So there's interactions.

665
01:09:56,040 --> 01:10:01,560
Again, it might be like an infectious disease model of people contracting and spreading disease, for example.

666
01:10:03,420 --> 01:10:07,710
Also, the problem is all this involves resource constraints. Maybe those should be included.

667
01:10:08,070 --> 01:10:16,900
So like organ transplant, if you're changing the organ allocation system and you decide that you're going to transplant it, you don't want to.

668
01:10:17,140 --> 01:10:22,950
We switch that order. There's only one organ. It is it is important to think about those resource constraints.

669
01:10:24,450 --> 01:10:30,570
And sometimes you might need hybrid models and model simplicity is really desirable.

670
01:10:30,980 --> 01:10:35,190
And for this class in particular, I strongly encourage you to use some models.

671
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:45,190
Sometimes the models must be more complex than that, though I can create a complexity might be necessary in some cases for this class.

672
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:50,390
I feel on the side of too much simplicity though, and that added complexity for the children.

673
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:54,870
But as you're a consumer of a cost effective analysis, that's not an excuse.

674
01:10:55,860 --> 01:11:00,419
So as a consumer, you know, you should expect that the models, you know, they can include everything,

675
01:11:00,420 --> 01:11:04,860
but they should include the most important components that are really relevant to that decision process.

676
01:11:05,310 --> 01:11:12,870
QUESTION Yes. So I assume that models are going to also be taking into account the systems that you're representing,

677
01:11:12,870 --> 01:11:15,090
as well as like the United States healthcare system.

678
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:25,140
That model of a disease is different than like a U.K. one because of the difference in allocation and decisions made just based on systems.

679
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:33,299
Well, perhaps. So the basic biology of it probably doesn't change, but some other parts of it might like, like the cost structures.

680
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:36,750
And the cost to do this procedure is very different in the U.S. than it is in the U.K.

681
01:11:37,230 --> 01:11:42,300
So and maybe, you know, here in the U.S., we treat medications and they're they treat in surgery.

682
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:47,670
So you want to take that into consideration as well?

683
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:49,080
Does that answer your question?

684
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:56,770
Would that be including and a model would that be a simple model or would that, I guess, inherently adds another layer?

685
01:11:56,940 --> 01:12:00,470
What part of it is is the is the the context.

686
01:12:00,490 --> 01:12:08,220
So are you doing this? If you're doing the analysis to inform U.S. decision making, then you'd make the model appropriate for the United States.

687
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:11,100
And if you're doing it for the U.K., then you make it appropriate for the U.K.

688
01:12:11,310 --> 01:12:16,680
Now, if you're trying to make some sort of model for more than one country in different context, then it does become more complex there.

689
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:21,080
I think you. Okay.

690
01:12:21,610 --> 01:12:26,650
So just kind of wrap up with Mark Bowling Choices here, you know, things to consider.

691
01:12:27,070 --> 01:12:31,080
You want to kind of tie your intermediate results to the final outcomes again.

692
01:12:31,090 --> 01:12:35,229
So if you, let's say, have medication that reduces cholesterol levels, how.

693
01:12:35,230 --> 01:12:37,480
Right. I really want to untie that constant health.

694
01:12:37,750 --> 01:12:44,260
So how can I link cholesterol levels across now for maybe I have some data on how stroke and heart attack are affecting my cholesterol level.

695
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:49,870
Those things affect Cosmo as I'm creating more models or even decision trees.

696
01:12:50,140 --> 01:12:53,650
All those branches should be mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive.

697
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:57,370
All those bubbles in my markup should be mutually exclusive. Based on.

698
01:12:59,140 --> 01:13:06,600
But as I'm selecting a model, here's a really high level tool, I think, or a flow chart that might be useful.

699
01:13:07,530 --> 01:13:10,740
So is my disease chronic or infectious?

700
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:22,530
If it's chronic, I'd probably want a decision tree or a mark off model, and it depends on do I think I can see the outcome at the end of my decision?

701
01:13:22,530 --> 01:13:26,879
Trees. If I can't, if I think there's some sort of long term evolution that I know about,

702
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:31,350
but I know some short term data to simulate the long term outcomes for my chronic disease.

703
01:13:32,070 --> 01:13:37,350
If I had an infectious disease, you can use a decision tree remarkable or dynamic infectious disease model.

704
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:41,640
If it's very simple and I'm dealing with a small population,

705
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:45,510
maybe decision tree would be good if I'm dealing with a small population and I

706
01:13:45,510 --> 01:13:48,960
don't think my intervention is going to affect the infectious disease dynamics.

707
01:13:49,620 --> 01:13:54,420
Maybe a mark on model abuse. So maybe it's like a treatment of an infectious disease that I don't think affects transmission.

708
01:13:54,900 --> 01:13:59,340
Maybe a mark on model would be fine. But if I think if I'm thinking about a broad policy,

709
01:13:59,610 --> 01:14:07,110
it will affect population disease transmission dynamics because I'm going to induce herd immunity with my big vaccination scheme.

710
01:14:07,770 --> 01:14:11,820
Then again, it's kind of how I think this.

711
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:19,769
And then a second stochastic again for this class I think it was relatively simple.

712
01:14:19,770 --> 01:14:24,690
Compartmental deterministic models will be good, but stochastic models can be really useful.

713
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:27,899
But in my opinion, oftentimes they're quite intense.

714
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:34,470
They take a lot of time, effort to develop a lot of time and effort to run so they can be but they can ofttimes give you some additional.

715
01:14:37,550 --> 01:14:43,880
Finally, just to remind you why you're here today, to hear the psychological health effects and also costs,

716
01:14:43,890 --> 01:14:49,670
the more costs increased, the more people have to heroically fight off paramedics trying to force you into that position.

717
01:14:51,590 --> 01:14:59,270
So with that, I'll kind of wrap up for today. I just want to mention that we had a homework assignment do and homework assignment two is coming up.

718
01:14:59,870 --> 01:15:06,740
And so I wanted to just show you what homework to.

719
01:15:09,260 --> 01:15:19,970
So one when decision trees are to is more commonly like homework one you can just use a Google sheet template to.

720
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:34,310
Turn in your homework assignment. If. Or to, again, is called modeling.

721
01:15:34,580 --> 01:15:39,980
There are three questions. There's the first one here is you're an analyst.

722
01:15:41,330 --> 01:15:47,690
Modeling a progressive disease starts asymptomatic, becomes symptomatic, and then people die from that.

723
01:15:49,340 --> 01:15:56,240
You're given information on these transitions and question one is to create a marker model in that spreadsheet.

724
01:15:56,940 --> 01:16:02,690
So what happens from today, 15 years out in a population that starts with asymptomatic disease?

725
01:16:03,080 --> 01:16:08,690
It's over time. What fraction of population will be symptomatic that over the 15 year period?

726
01:16:10,670 --> 01:16:15,960
And then what's the median survival time? From from that.

727
01:16:15,970 --> 01:16:27,959
It's kind of a basic question about that. Well, what's interesting, the medium to mean that which we don't like, I mean,

728
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:37,760
is the average you can get on so many takes in that the the total number we add up the total things and divide by the total number.

729
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:47,760
So that's our mean what's the median, even if even observation, then it's like I really don't know anything about words and or number.

730
01:16:50,460 --> 01:16:58,110
Yeah. So you kind of rank all of the observations. Let's say you have 100 in descending order, that you have observations one through 100.

731
01:16:58,710 --> 01:17:04,560
The median is going to be the the one right in the middle. So half of the population is going to be shorter.

732
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:12,330
And half of this one or in this case, half of the population will have a shorter life expectancy and half punishment of a longer life expectancy.

733
01:17:12,510 --> 01:17:16,379
And you should be able to figure that out from this markup model when you know how many people are alive.

734
01:17:16,380 --> 01:17:24,860
And our question two is kind of making something a little more complex.

735
01:17:24,890 --> 01:17:28,080
The question one, question one, you're just asymptomatic, asymptomatic and dead.

736
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:31,380
Question two says, well, actually, it's more complex than that.

737
01:17:31,950 --> 01:17:39,420
You can be asymptomatic and then you can develop stage one disease and stage one turns to the stage two, stage first to stage the stage two.

738
01:17:39,450 --> 01:17:43,320
So to stage three and then stage three people die.

739
01:17:43,710 --> 01:17:49,470
So now we have several stage where you're transitioning from basic fact, one one, 2 to 3, three death.

740
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:51,570
So these are your annual probabilities here.

741
01:17:51,870 --> 01:18:01,440
So progression to a you're doing the same thing except this little more complex model where you have five health states instead of three.

742
01:18:04,650 --> 01:18:13,320
And so you create the mark on one, two, eight and then discuss how is your answer to to a different from wanting the one.

743
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:16,860
That's right. And then question three.

744
01:18:19,060 --> 01:18:24,360
Is to figure out some costs.

745
01:18:25,150 --> 01:18:35,709
So taking the model of disease from question to you have annual costs associated with being asymptomatic state 1 to 3 of debt and kind of

746
01:18:35,710 --> 01:18:43,390
think like you are an insurance company who is covering a thousand patients with asymptomatic disease today from asymptomatic disease today.

747
01:18:43,750 --> 01:18:49,870
And then similarly over that 15 year time period in question to you say that where they were, which health issue are they going to be?

748
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:53,620
And of course, in three year you're calculating costs.

749
01:18:53,620 --> 01:18:55,629
So how much spending with the insurance company,

750
01:18:55,630 --> 01:19:04,480
how do you run your two or three or four and calculate over the next five years what's the total spending going to be

751
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:11,440
for this insurance company to cover those patients who have a thousand patients who we start off today with a disease?

752
01:19:13,490 --> 01:19:18,370
Any questions? Okay.

753
01:19:20,570 --> 01:19:25,280
Well, I think we're running out of time here today. Hopefully, that's that's been helpful if you have questions.

754
01:19:26,420 --> 01:19:32,130
I'm happy to answer that about this next class and or office hours, too.

755
01:19:33,890 --> 01:19:37,700
So next week, again, Zoom lectures, I'll send out a link for that. Yeah.

756
01:19:38,090 --> 01:19:41,540
So thanks for your time here today. Yeah.

757
01:19:41,780 --> 01:19:57,890
It looks like asking me to settle for a of press, but I think you might like the way I talk about what I like.
