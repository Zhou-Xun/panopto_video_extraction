1
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:10,680
Well, we're reaching
the end of this course.

2
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,840
Just a couple of final remarks.

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,280
Remember, I told you that

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,530
data analysis is
all about practice,

5
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:19,260
practice, and practice,
and more practice.

6
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,914
Now that you have some
good solid foundation,

7
00:00:21,914 --> 00:00:23,565
you just need to start practicing

8
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:25,950
with real live
research questions.

9
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:27,750
At the beginning of the course,

10
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,510
I also use the pilot
analogy in the sense that

11
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,870
EPID602 would be a
flight simulator to you.

12
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:35,700
That is a safe space to make

13
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,295
mistakes and learn
from your mistakes.

14
00:00:38,295 --> 00:00:41,865
After graduation, you'll
be flying on your own.

15
00:00:41,865 --> 00:00:44,670
Some final unsolicited advice.

16
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,910
Know what is really wrong.

17
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:49,370
For example, you can never run

18
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:50,900
a linear regression model with

19
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,940
a binary outcome task
completely wrong.

20
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:55,460
But for the rest, it depends.

21
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:58,040
There are many ways to
do data analysis and

22
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,295
every question requires
a different approach,

23
00:01:00,295 --> 00:01:01,995
so be creative.

24
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:05,180
Now, you're ready
to fly on your own.

25
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:09,931
Finally, a big thank you
for being a great class.
