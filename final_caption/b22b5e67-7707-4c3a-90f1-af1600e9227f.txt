1
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:28,490
Okay. So you can hear me adjusting it.

2
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:34,560
Can you actually hear me speaking into it? Okay, so welcome to branding and Software Instruction,

3
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:40,739
which is one of these classes which on one hand gives you a basic toolkit to think about things, and the other hand very,

4
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:50,340
very quickly slides into very kind of matter dorm room reflections on the nature of reality, which I suppose is a reasonable definition of human life.

5
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:59,649
So I'm going to talk briefly about some of the key concepts to think about framing and social construction and target populations.

6
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:03,910
And I'll go through those. And then, as you'll be amazed to hear,

7
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:09,670
we're going to spend quite a lot of time on an exercise which is going to be to do with gender affirming care policy,

8
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:18,189
which is broadly health care, that affirms the stated gender of the person being treated instead of,

9
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:22,300
for example, judging by the physical characteristics of the person in front of them exclusively,

10
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:30,190
as you might imagine in American politics in 2022, this is a very, very politically salient issue.

11
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:33,370
It is also, however, kind of interesting,

12
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:40,329
and our authors of the readings would argue sexually happy story of how the social construction of populations

13
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:46,510
on both sides has actually led to a better outcome than we saw or would have expected in 224 or 28,

14
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,800
etc. We're going to try and apply logic of framing and social construction of populations

15
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:58,330
to understanding the contours of the national gender affirming care debate,

16
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:02,890
which is inseparable from the broader debate about political participation, about trans rights.

17
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:08,440
I want to underline something here. When using transgender rights as a case study of broader politics.

18
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:15,549
There's not a class about the desirability or appropriateness or how to help us the technical dimensions of that.

19
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:23,710
I'm not qualified to teach any of these things. It is about something that if you could ask any observer in American politics, 50,000 or so,

20
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:30,040
they would never in a million years have imagined that there would be legal protections for gender affirming care anywhere.

21
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:35,410
They would never have imagined that there would be gender neutral bathroom bathrooms at any number of institutions, public or private.

22
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,639
Something very big has happened here,

23
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:43,870
and we're going to try to understand what happens there as a way of drawing lessons about how you get things done in politics.

24
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:48,040
Because right under our noses, something that you would never have predicted has started to happen.

25
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:54,910
So it's not normative. It's certainly not about the actual components of gender affirming care, because what do I know?

26
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:01,180
It's about the politics and specifically the mobilization and framing social construction dimensions.

27
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:05,260
As usual, this class is basically a festival of problematic content.

28
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:09,190
Feel free to step out. Do whatever you need to.

29
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:16,100
So I started I thought it would be really provocative to leave with a quote from Lenin.

30
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:19,640
But, you know, I figured somebody might just like that.

31
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:25,700
Lenin famously described politics as who? Translation, who does what to whom?

32
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:31,370
And that's not a bad definition of politics. As a matter of fact, it's a really concise, isn't it?

33
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:35,400
Who? You sound like a model.

34
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:44,460
That's the only drawback. It doesn't it doesn't work that way in Russia. But the problem is raising the question says, who are we?

35
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:48,780
Who are they? Who are the people we're talking about? What are their characteristics?

36
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:52,730
We have a very live example of that that we're watching the redefinition,

37
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:58,620
the result of reconstruction, socially, of abortion happening under our noses,

38
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:06,330
because there's a spectacular mismatch between what laws some of the very old look like, what medical care looks like,

39
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:13,410
and what the demographics of people receiving treatment that fit under definitions of abortion of these various laws.

40
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,870
Which is probably why you're having a very salient conversation about ectopic pregnancy right now,

41
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:24,530
because the population that had got socially and politically constructed is receiving abortions,

42
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:31,470
had not in anybody's head, or at least in most people's heads, had apparently not included women suffering ectopic pregnancy.

43
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,930
So suddenly, ectopic pregnancy is on the agenda in a way they absolutely weren't before the Dobbs decision.

44
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:43,290
Why weren't they on the agenda? Because we weren't going by, say, a definite explanation a gynecologist would give us,

45
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:50,970
because we were going by definitions that were set based on framing the population of people getting abortions in a political and social process.

46
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,880
So this is live and it's happening in front of us.

47
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,700
And everyone in the room has some kind of a relationship to this debate because you're alive in the United States today.

48
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:10,470
But I'll use this for a better example. This is a photograph from a reporter showing a rally in Sanford, Florida, a town some of you might know of.

49
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:19,200
Extra credit, if you can name probably Sanford's most famous recent visitor.

50
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:27,540
Trayvon Martin. So Trump held a rally on October 12th in Sanford, Florida.

51
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:32,820
Now, you've seen political rallies. You've seen the basic iconography of American political rallies and how we do it.

52
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:38,690
Anything really stand out here? Oh.

53
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:45,240
There's a thin blue line, but there's a thin blue line flag,

54
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:51,870
which I put this up because I want you to be proud of the fact that that was invented by a University of Michigan

55
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:58,049
undergraduate who spotted a business opportunity because there's a BLM flag and that the police didn't have a flag.

56
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:08,040
And he thought maybe you should balance things in the market, so go loop the entrepreneurial is the billionaire investor.

57
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:17,850
Seriously, what is the thin blue line flag other than an entrepreneurial opportunity for that young person?

58
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:31,270
This isn't a trick question. Blue lives matter.

59
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:39,349
Which means. Which means less go cops paying back the asses.

60
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:43,510
Because otherwise we'll be rolling this thing around the rim all the time. All in America.

61
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,660
So who are the cops? Who? What does Thin Blue Line mean?

62
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:51,559
Like, if we take it, it is originally a metaphor for something specific.

63
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,690
It's not just the thing you put on the back of your car.

64
00:06:53,850 --> 00:07:02,240
I think it's a pushback against Black Lives Matter sort of kind of felt like they were being subjugated somehow and they're much less.

65
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:09,010
Well, I want to add, these are also. Yeah, so Black Lives Matter is the assertion that Black Lives Matter,

66
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:16,550
which responses that police officers Lives Matter and apparently police are blue now.

67
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:21,890
And you can also get variance on this, right? You get a red stripe. It means that you're in favor of firefighters like in the circle.

68
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:25,630
Photograph flies pretty quickly. What is the thin blue line?

69
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:32,050
Why isn't it a fat blue line or a, you know, squiggly blue circle?

70
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:42,830
But I'm sorry. Way to show solidarity again, because those are the countries that are at risk.

71
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:47,060
And we want to, you know, call out to the families of these.

72
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:56,060
Kind of. It's kind of the in the sense of doing protesters, the violent police, the lab.

73
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:02,500
That's the blue line. So there's a literal image. Now, let's work with this like this is it like this?

74
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:06,960
This is your moment of doing this comparative literature or media studies degree for about 5 minutes here.

75
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:14,570
Humans are narratives and artistic creatures. What happens if you remove the thin blue line?

76
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:20,030
What does the Thin Blue Line stand between? Gender anarchy.

77
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:25,190
The police are the thin blue line separating law abiding citizens from anarchy.

78
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:34,300
Riots from Portland, Oregon. You watch Fox and you'll see what I mean about poor Mike.

79
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:40,280
So the people who I noticed you just invoked an entire worldview.

80
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:47,750
Right. And it's a perfectly common worldview is held by like a third of the human race, no matter what country you read,

81
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:54,020
which is that there is a natural propensity for people to be absolutely terrible, a kind of nonstop purge thing.

82
00:08:54,740 --> 00:09:02,299
And you need authority who are willing to put their lives on the line in order to protect law abiding, reasonable, decent citizens.

83
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,340
From that, you might need other things as well.

84
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:11,600
But that thin blue line is kind of what separates our society from our worst impulses and our worst actions.

85
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:16,819
Okay. So far, that's a general proposition about political philosophy,

86
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:20,630
which is why I can essentially ask survey questions anywhere in the world and get that.

87
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:28,880
A third of the population is sure to agree with that statement. Back up to the fact that this is a very highly contextualized event.

88
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:35,720
This is a Donald Trump rally in the middle of his reelection campaign. So somebody characterize it as go cops.

89
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:41,910
What's so what do we think this is saying? We ought to heard a bunch of it, like.

90
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:47,210
You all live in the United States. So it's not a trick question.

91
00:09:54,320 --> 00:10:00,560
And saying that Trump supporters essentially support the police and implies that they're against it.

92
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:03,889
Yes, support the police and they're against Black Lives Matter.

93
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:09,530
And notice we're now associating Black Lives Matter and the George Floyd protests with and I think you see them move their.

94
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:15,650
Again. You know, Portland, like too much of that coffee really gets to you.

95
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:22,880
Furthermore, is anything missing here? Anything you would normally expect in American politics.

96
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:31,970
An American flag will fly, right? You know, my grandmother would have absolutely lost it because she would have put it out as defiling flag.

97
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:37,100
You know, she was mad that, you know, people left flags flying all night, supposed to take them down at dusk in her world.

98
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,740
So she would have not comprehended that in the slightest.

99
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:51,080
So a bunch of moves here happen to define a way, to define a day, to define the people that we support.

100
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:57,190
Obviously, Donald Trump is the principal one. To develop a certain kind of concept of America.

101
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:03,280
Notice, by the way, the very nice Kennedy era Air Force One maps onto the physical academic.

102
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:07,899
Well, is that it's pretty bit the Trump trademark make it blue doesn't quite go with it it would've been gorgeous

103
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:14,110
otherwise you're watching here an entire play and the funny thing about people is we can understand all of it.

104
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,680
This is social construction of populations.

105
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:25,670
This is framing and this is doing it. It's a political rally.

106
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,270
We're trying this is to try and get Donald Trump reelected and it's being done.

107
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:35,480
Notice of the very, very clear mobilization of intent. Right. Is fundamentally a fact that if you do this, this kind of argument,

108
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:46,610
the we who are mobilized by it will win against the they who are either demobilized or more likely mobilized in the equally angry opposite direction.

109
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:53,970
So let's do that academic process. These are quotes from kind of the classic article about it.

110
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:59,820
It has a broader implication beyond the actual, you know, Trump era politics.

111
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:07,829
Basically, it's about cultural characterizations or popular images of people who are affected by public policy,

112
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:13,590
such as police are affected by public policy because they're employed by it to default some successfully.

113
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:19,379
What to do? Obviously, people who have interactions with the police are affected by those policies as to what the police are

114
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:22,920
doing and what the police are told to do with what the accountability of the police officers is.

115
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:29,280
These characterizations are normative and evaluative and portray groups in positive or negative terms through symbolic languages,

116
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:33,330
metaphors and stories. The thin blue line standing between us and anarchy.

117
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:41,120
Which in the context of 2020, Anarchy and Black Lives Matter had a very, very specific meaning.

118
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,400
Now, this creates strong pressures, right?

119
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:55,310
So, for example, one of the big problems with drug policy is ending up under the medicalization criminalization therapy.

120
00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:03,680
So basically the social construction of people using illegal drugs matters enormously to how we handle it.

121
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:10,910
So, for example, marijuana, I've got it made illegal in the forties in large part because it became associated with Mexicans.

122
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:16,759
So the control of this tip of several migrant workers with sort of marijuana came to be illegal.

123
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:25,250
And then it became very internalized and very, very politically and culturally stigmatized when it became associated with the hippies.

124
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:31,400
Right. Led to sort of the whole Haight-Ashbury wafts of smoke, you know, pot smoke from the 1860s.

125
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:37,070
Over time, it gradually emerged that hippies lost their salience as a problem.

126
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:41,750
Mexican-Americans ceased to be associated in the eyes of our political elites with marijuana.

127
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:50,540
And it started to turn into what it manifestly is in Michigan today, which is a bunch of edibles for like some middle aged person with a bad back the.

128
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:56,850
So we can run through various cases of this.

129
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:01,580
Right. Let's take opioids. Anyone know the basic pattern of who's dying right now?

130
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:06,240
Opioid overdoses. Male white way. Bingo.

131
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,600
We just did a big social construction because actually, guess what?

132
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,550
The opioid epidemic didn't end in Baltimore.

133
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:19,950
There's still a lot of nonwhite and a significant number of non male and a very large number of non rural people dying of fentanyl.

134
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:24,780
But have you watched The Wire?

135
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:29,320
Are we going to unleash that on East Liverpool, Ohio?

136
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:38,630
When the opioid epidemic was quoted as heroin and it was quoted as urban, a word freighted with meaning in the United States.

137
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:46,530
You got the national power when you recode it through things like the East Liverpool,

138
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:51,389
Ohio Police Department tweeting out a photograph of two parents dead from overdoses

139
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,000
in the front of a car and a kid strapped into the child seat in the back.

140
00:14:54,630 --> 00:15:01,530
That's obviously it's quite stigmatizing for the parents, although I if I recall the case correctly, they weren't around to be troubled by it anymore.

141
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,640
But that's a very, very different coding that you're seeing. Right.

142
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:13,350
So again, the way that these populations are being constructed affects how we talk about the opioid emergency is medicalized.

143
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:18,929
Third case, Mike Pence, governor of Indiana, back when Scott County, Indiana,

144
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:24,600
hit the point where one out of every thousand people was being diagnosed with HIV in a one year period due to shared details.

145
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:32,700
Scott County, Indiana is what you think it is. It is a thinly populated rural county, a little bit kind of northwest of Louisville.

146
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:41,520
That state of Indiana passed essentially a whole legal infrastructure, which was somewhat incoherent,

147
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:46,079
but it was allowed to provide needle exchanges and clean needle programs by county

148
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:51,750
governments in Indiana in response to emergency circumstances to do with HIV circulation.

149
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:58,050
In other words, when it hits a rural county, you get different responses than a frankly,

150
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:03,680
not trivially different absolute death rate would get in the cities of Indiana in a different year when it was covered differently.

151
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:07,600
These are all cases of social construction. Most American drug policy.

152
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:13,350
You can basically infer from who is thought by the political elites of the media to be using the drug in question.

153
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:21,570
So you can go a little bit deeper, right? When you're creative, we're going to do things like apply for licenses later in the class.

154
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:26,430
You don't have to have a dog. You don't actually have to license your dog either.

155
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:30,690
In my classes, I have no idea what the actual rule is about owning a dog.

156
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:36,770
But these are all sorts of other burdens, right? So abscess.

157
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:42,920
You all had experience with FAFSA forms. Did you enjoy it? What did you feel like you were being made into?

158
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:51,400
Somebody wants to defraud the federal government. Right. Those young people.

159
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:58,299
So they started to trying to real policies. So there's a lot of policies and we'll come back to this later,

160
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:02,530
the class that are essentially deliberately misleading because the policies are being targeted at people that

161
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:07,630
policymakers would like to stigmatize or already do stigmatize and therefore see as reasonable stigmatization.

162
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:14,680
So policy sends messages about what government is supposed to do, which citizens are deserving,

163
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:19,200
and what kinds of attitudes and thought patterns are appropriate in a democratic society.

164
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:22,180
Our approach to all the arguments about fellow disenfranchisement.

165
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:29,560
For an example of that, and if you Google fellow disenfranchisement, Florida, you will have an unpleasant, really fascinating after dinner.

166
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:34,240
Trust me, actually, one thing I want to highlight there,

167
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:42,070
the top quote is about how people are constructed by sort of a broad social political conversation.

168
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:49,510
Notice the bottom quote does something different. The bottom quote says the policies, the construct you turn into your social construction.

169
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:56,620
So can I recommend living in a more than in a if you want to buy a condo in Ann Arbor or pretty much anywhere in America?

170
00:17:56,830 --> 00:18:02,630
How many floors should it have? Why do?

171
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:14,090
Expensive as much as couple of nice five story, you know, like there's one in sort of downtown Ann Arbor down by the railroad tracks.

172
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:17,420
It's five stories tall, so factory looks good. Why don't you want to better?

173
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:30,520
Because astonishingly, both mortgage insurance and mortgages even charge higher rates and higher insurance rates on taller buildings.

174
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:38,680
Now. Are they thinking a bunch of yuppies in a five story converted factory in downtown

175
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:43,150
Ann Arbor as the population it's living in taller than five storey buildings?

176
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,100
Are they thinking of something else?

177
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:52,909
You're charging people more to live in higher buildings, which is essentially a way of penalizing people who live in denser urban environments.

178
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:56,000
See what just happened. Oh.

179
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:59,980
And I speak from personal experience, and I was mad as a hornet.

180
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:07,990
I had been converted by public policy into somebody who was supposed to subsidize everyone else's misadventures,

181
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:11,920
because I chose to live in a tall building and five stories is not a tall building that way.

182
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:18,190
Okay, so policy shaped you as well as the image of you shapes what policies are made towards.

183
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:26,890
So two examples here of the process, right. So frames the organizing principles.

184
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:28,959
So for example,

185
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:35,050
I think you might characterize a lot of what happened in 2020 is a lot of people reconsidering the frame within which they view the place.

186
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:45,480
You are the police officer friendly. Are the police essentially, you know, the thin blue line, right?

187
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:49,610
That's afraid of the police. The police are here to maintain order on behalf of us.

188
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:52,620
That's a threat. Right. And you see, Fran, all the time,

189
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:58,740
do you frame the people with opioid use disorder as needing medical assistance or do you frame

190
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:03,240
people the opioid use disorder as victims of dealers who need to get cuffed around the head?

191
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:10,740
Or do you frame people with opioid use disorder as the perpetrators of their own fates who need deterrence from the form of stiff prison sentences?

192
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:15,060
These are all frames masquerading as policy arguments. Who are these people?

193
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,960
Because if they're essentially victims, then you go after the people victimizing them.

194
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:24,390
And if they're essentially criminals, then you treat them the way we treat criminals in the United States.

195
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:34,909
So I'll give you two examples. What are some other frames about how we think about things and remember everything we think about?

196
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:39,350
We think about through a frame you are all framing. He is a professor at graduate school.

197
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:45,770
If you framed me as a hip hop performer, you would be much more disappointed with my performance right now.

198
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:55,140
We assume that the majority of people we interact with, not murders.

199
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:58,080
You said that you framed more people as not murderers.

200
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:04,620
But you make a basic kind of assumption about a whole set of good faith issues when you interact with individual people.

201
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:11,820
And that's a broader social frame. Most people are okay, or at least most people are repressed by a well-functioning, repressive system.

202
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:17,330
Okay, good. I vote for a universal health care and a socialist.

203
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:23,380
Don't be so big on universal health care as socialist, and we don't need socialism here, so you got to have rights.

204
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:29,200
So, first of all, socialism bad. And secondly, things they do in other socialist countries bad.

205
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:34,770
So you can enjoy a holiday. Paris if you go to. A lot of things you want to bring back from Paris.

206
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,420
The players forget the.

207
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:50,329
I tried to repress my desire to go on about international comparisons because I'm one of these miserable people who could always sit there and say,

208
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:58,980
You got to fix that problem. Sweden. Like Sweden. I've lost both of you in order.

209
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,790
I think a lot of people would disagree with that. Stupid.

210
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:10,720
Yeah. I mean, in a sense. Or really smart right this both sides so this stupid like why don't you see the world right?

211
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:17,200
So instead of a person who disagrees with me in some principled way, there's person who can't make the sophisticated, logical connections I do.

212
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:20,950
There's also, like one of the blanket rules of politics. Always remember this.

213
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:26,290
If you're on Twitter, remember it twice as hard, which is that everybody thinks the other political party is much smarter.

214
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,500
Okay, if you go on Democratic leaning Twitter,

215
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:34,150
it's all about how the Republicans are actually in the fifth decade of a master plan to take over America.

216
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:40,120
If you go on Republican Twitter, it's about how the Democrats are in the fifth decade to master plan to take over America.

217
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:47,650
And you have to give the Republicans Twitter points on this, because that's like the five decades Nancy Pelosi has been leader of the House Democrats.

218
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:53,710
So you're me, by the way, 11% of the whole history of Democratic Party, the House delegations that led by Nancy Pelosi.

219
00:22:56,770 --> 00:23:01,570
In other words, you frame people based on intelligence instead of, for example, moral differences.

220
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:08,900
I was going to say framing systems as a delivery system is.

221
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:22,000
Rehab systems which are typically portrayed how like looking at like how we do in prisons as a place of like reform and like social rehabilitation.

222
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:26,509
So there's an effort and that's why we call them things like the correctional system.

223
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:30,829
The idea, you know, it's not called the punitive system or penitentiary doesn't mean you're supposed to be penitent,

224
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:35,090
which you're supposed to feel differently according to that etymological logic.

225
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,830
But if you call the Department of Corrections, like people get corrected, they come up corrected.

226
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:50,610
Or as jail. Means jail the school renting the rent for summer school, let it go.

227
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:54,209
And then the high, the price, death, everything.

228
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:57,230
So there are people even lower status.

229
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:02,070
Can't afford to live in that. We need to send their children to school.

230
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:09,270
Yes. Oh, that's true. So this is basically, you know, the United States rations education by house price.

231
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:13,520
Although vouchers are turning it into something else progressively.

232
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,999
But traditionally the US rations education by house price.

233
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,300
Peoples proxy for education is not necessarily that good.

234
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:25,190
Like it has far more to do with their perception of who their kid would be going to school with.

235
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:31,190
In other words, social construction of the kids than it does without things like test scores or college admission rates.

236
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:37,760
But once you frame school as a sort of competitive upward mobility project,

237
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:44,240
then you're going to trigger the logic that people who are most invested in that are going to buy in the neighborhood, price everyone else else out.

238
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:52,210
And the results of that, our. We framed abortion as a moral failing instead of basic health care.

239
00:24:54,620 --> 00:25:00,680
Yes. So two framings of abortion right now. One is it is murder, and the other one is that it's health care.

240
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:09,680
One of the funny things about the abortion portrayal is that there's a split in the people in favor of abortion rights,

241
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:16,580
in large part because the biggest by far the heftiest, most politically salient organization in the field is Planned Parenthood.

242
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:21,250
And Planned Parenthood has two jobs. It runs clinics, it performs procedures.

243
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:25,760
That's health care and it has a twin lobbying organization.

244
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:31,970
So what do you do when, for example, the Dobbs decision is leaked and it becomes clear that Roe versus Wade was going to be doomed?

245
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,360
You have these unbelievably awkward rallies.

246
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:42,060
I was watching the messaging in which somebody comes out, says abortion is legal, except abortion is about to be legal.

247
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:47,700
You see the fight. Planned Parenthood doesn't want to deter people from using health care services that they're providing,

248
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:53,340
while at the same time trying to mobilize people with something very powerful, which is the threat to take away Iraq.

249
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:58,080
If somebody comes and says, I'm going to take away one of your rights. That's one of the best ways to make people really angry.

250
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:03,389
But if I come to you, I end up with a totally mixed message there,

251
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:09,900
because I'm simultaneously a provider saying I'll use my services and I can't do it like a going out of business sale.

252
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,990
But do it's like come use my services now because I get shut down.

253
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:20,150
Can't really do that. And so you end up with this weird mixed messaging, whereas the Right to Life, which is kind of the organizational,

254
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:26,180
the national right and the organizational core of people opposed to abortion, they just had a really strict abortion is murder.

255
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:29,750
The decision was bad law. The law about to be fixed. The murder picked up.

256
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:36,650
That's much more coherent than abortion is legal, which is why you're all at a rally to protest abortion becoming illegal,

257
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:40,180
which was what Planned Parenthood managed to achieve. Okay.

258
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:44,890
Now this is tied to newsworthiness. It's about getting attention. Okay.

259
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:49,930
So there was a reading like a very short reading, which was basically just some lists from the Purdue writing lab.

260
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:52,780
Anybody remember some of the things that make something newsworthy?

261
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:57,490
And the example I will give you is you will all be aware that the Queen of England died last week.

262
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:03,770
Yes. You might be less aware that a third of Pakistan is underwater, that there's no electricity in Puerto Rico.

263
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:09,050
Gorbachev also done it. Why is the queen of America?

264
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:15,320
She's got to be queen of America, right? Yeah.

265
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:20,000
So. So why is our Dear Queen funeral so much more interesting than three?

266
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:25,640
You might say more consequential events. We use the term sorry.

267
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:29,270
The article used the term sweet people, elite people.

268
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:34,669
And it's very much harder to be more elite that only the United Kingdom, which she technically does.

269
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:41,629
People in the UK likes to talk to you about how they're citizens. It's not that the United Kingdom is not like that.

270
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:46,210
It's solid constitutional law. It's like me telling you how many articles the Constitution has.

271
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:53,240
There are subjects that register is massive alien peoples, things that happen to elites.

272
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:57,110
That's why it's such an easy thing to make fun of The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal,

273
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:05,490
because no matter what they're doing in their role as broad sources of information for the world, they're all fundamentally right.

274
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:10,000
The people on the Upper West Side of the Upper East Side of Manhattan. So as a cultural piece, they're supposed to be.

275
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,710
Okay. What are some other things? So elite people.

276
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:23,200
So people like your tragedy are bad because something happens that draws the things and more like, what are you?

277
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:28,059
Everybody knows exactly the people that were killed.

278
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:32,500
And interesting to see that something would happen to somebody.

279
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:35,680
But I know that nobody cares. Negativity, bias.

280
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:40,690
Exactly. There's a very strong negativity bias. The local TV version is the phrase If it bleeds, it leads.

281
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:42,429
So this, for example,

282
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:50,890
affects perceptions of crime a lot because there will always be enough crime in southeast Michigan to fill the first 10 minutes of a local newscast.

283
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:56,740
Like there always will be. You know, there's enough crime like everywhere but Singapore to fill the first 10 minutes of TV show.

284
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:03,110
Therefore, crime rates in Michigan varied like pretty much independently.

285
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:07,700
You know, likelihood of being a victim of a crime, of course, is very low for most Americans.

286
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:13,520
The crime rates vary pretty much independently of people's concern about crime because people's concern about crime,

287
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:15,680
given that they don't mostly experience much crime,

288
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:21,470
is mediated by the media and the media as the negativity bias because it's much more exciting to hear about somebody getting murdered.

289
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:28,820
Especially elite people getting murdered. That's a really good. Right? You know, Pistons star got carjacked like ten years ago.

290
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:32,880
I think that was all they talked about for a month in the Detroit media. Okay.

291
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:39,900
People in the power position, when they do something happen to Biden, they will be because we like illegal immigrants.

292
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:45,750
Yeah, I say I suppose it's legitimate to have the executive with the nuclear codes,

293
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:50,739
health status, the conservative heart machine, who's the actor who got over it?

294
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:57,390
And then America was like, oh, this is a thing. You remember that? Oh, okay.

295
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:01,230
Let me tell you guys, what's another one? What's another thing that gets the media going?

296
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:05,159
Controversy. Controversy, conflict, conflict.

297
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:14,880
Frank Right. So if you want to write a news story that's going to get clicks from upper middle class Americans who are disproportionately democratic,

298
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:21,030
you would say conflicts between Democrats and Republicans in which you can say the Republicans are doing something really bad.

299
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:29,000
That's The New York Times formula so superficially about the conflict, because conflict gets clicks and conflict is led by elites.

300
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,100
So you can have leads to hate figures that we can find with Marjorie Taylor.

301
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:39,410
GREENE AOC say, because the media loves them for obvious reasons and you can usually have a subtext of something really bad is happening.

302
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:45,840
Truth is being really have something really bad is much more interesting than something that's a good.

303
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:50,250
What's another one? Copy. It is still bad. We're having a 911 every every twice a week.

304
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:59,660
F can't remember the word they used, but I'm going to say status. So like if you have something that happened in a developed country,

305
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:03,590
it's more likely to be covered than something that happening in developing countries.

306
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:09,210
Yeah. Hands up. If you knew how much of Pakistan is under water. Wow.

307
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:13,400
Okay. I'm very proud of you about that. Okay, I'll stop getting soppy and call our people.

308
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:17,030
But, like, Americans know very little about Pakistan.

309
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,979
And let's just say most of what you've heard, if you're just an ordinary American consumer,

310
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:25,550
has not been super positive in most of its kind of suspiciously 20 years old.

311
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:33,070
So there underwater just doesn't fit right. Two more men's World Cup.

312
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:41,590
Awesome. I was going to say, okay, I think I was going to talk about sensationalism, not something that comes to mind.

313
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:49,210
We had a transgender person had two female leading, you know, sporting positions.

314
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:56,620
Right. Exactly. Novelty framing. That's why I was also I sort of Daniel, I put it like, this guy's boring.

315
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:03,700
We're done. Like, watch the public trackers disappear, you know, watch the reporters get reassigned to other things.

316
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:07,990
Because with COVID, I mean, sure,

317
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:13,120
we had a September 11th every about twice a week here in the United States at the moment, if I recall the data correctly.

318
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:20,950
But it's been that way forever. Like, what are we supposed to what is the additional entertainment of learning that we're still seeing 6000 deaths?

319
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:27,090
What's the fun of that? We can even get a new variant we're still hovering around about.

320
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:35,730
It'd be a five MP, a 2.4 or five. That's like a bore. Ukraine likewise huge surge of attention to Ukraine in February and March when Americans

321
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:40,700
quite a number of Americans learned started on that and then it just after attacks.

322
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:43,170
Right. But do you think that's pulling it because nobody is clicking on it?

323
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:49,570
Well, you could say this is because Americans are just flying and have no commitments to embrace democracy, fighting for its defense.

324
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:51,750
You can also say I am not learning a damn thing.

325
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:57,690
The front is not moving and I have no impact whatsoever on whether or not Sloviansk is in Ukrainian hands.

326
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:00,770
Therefore, I'm going to stop reading obsessive media coverage.

327
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:08,450
Self normality. Ukraine launches a successful offensive novelty app on the front pages.

328
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:14,810
Trump says something outrageous, not normal. Violence says something outrageous.

329
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:19,580
All right. So why has trouble at the funeral queen novelty, right?

330
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:27,660
How? I don't remember the last royal funeral because I'm a little, like thinking of buying my dog for the most last royal funeral.

331
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:35,480
But he's got a shop. They were like in the early fifties. I think you just look at the framing that made that funny.

332
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:40,600
I said I didn't remember Biden's age. Like two thirds of you perceived a joke.

333
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:44,700
See what happened there? Okay.

334
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:51,210
So newsworthy. You basically got it all. Novelty, negativity, elites, conflict.

335
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:54,990
Bear this in mind in particular, if you want to create problems in the problems straight.

336
00:33:56,090 --> 00:34:01,790
I know the way to get something going and negativity alone probably isn't enough to do it.

337
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:05,060
Pakistan news very negative. The Puerto Rico News Extremely negative.

338
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:10,340
But I don't see the only conflict about Puerto Rico. I don't see really. It's talking about Puerto Rico.

339
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:14,540
I don't see them as I'm not sure about the novelty of Puerto Rico.

340
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:21,409
I mean, Puerto Rico is in a hurricane path. And thanks to policies, I could go on about it.

341
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:29,600
Length has terrible infrastructure. So I have a question about that because Puerto Rico technically a part of the U.S.

342
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:38,180
So wouldn't that make it in? But half of American citizens on the mainland do not know that Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens.

343
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:41,810
Puerto Rico is not a U.S. state. The Puerto Ricans are citizens of the United States.

344
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:47,240
And I'm so close to like launching off into something up the next half hour with the insane,

345
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:56,140
immoral situation involving the governance of Puerto Rico. I was going to say it makes me remember the previous hurricane with no paper towels

346
00:34:56,140 --> 00:35:00,160
or anything like that and you get coverage not actually helping the people there.

347
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:06,290
If that is thrown out, partly because it did, it was a perfect metaphor.

348
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:14,140
Remember, this is all about how humans are basically artistic creatures. If my house has been destroyed and I don't have insulin.

349
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:24,000
Banks paper towel. Incidentally, he then had to be prevented from throwing canned goods.

350
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:31,170
So we narrowly avoided an even more astonishing photo op of somebody getting chomped by a can of tomato soup.

351
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:38,720
Okay, that was fun. Now we're going to do an exercise here.

352
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:42,930
What I want to stress is this is one of these exercises where the journey is more interesting than the destination.

353
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:48,419
Okay, so what you talk through and then the reflection questions are more the focus

354
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:52,050
then becoming experts in the politics of trans rights in Idaho or what have you.

355
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:59,180
What are you going to do? Is it going to focus on the back issue?

356
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:05,340
So here's what I promised you. If you look at just about any theory of politics, let's go back to 2002.

357
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:13,080
You'll get essentially any theory of politics. And you will say the trans rights movement is just absolutely do like not even going to hatch out.

358
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:22,469
Why? Well, some and all you ever read about the generally terrible set of things that America does to people

359
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:27,629
who are trans right victimization by crime in some effects residential vets finding housing,

360
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:32,070
finding jobs. It is just a litany of discrimination and it is severe.

361
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:35,520
Right. You know, you start to transition you a bunch of risks.

362
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,910
Just absolutely go up to do with transphobia in American society.

363
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:43,650
Already. That's not the population you want to mobilize, right?

364
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:49,870
There's a reason why the homeless who are kind of the debt plus all of that, tend not to have a lot of political power.

365
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:53,920
It's very hard to have political power in to address if you are on the receiving

366
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:58,360
end of a whole bunch of interlocking intersectional forms of discrimination.

367
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:04,249
Already the political system is not set up to serve. History of extremely negative social construction.

368
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:08,730
I doubt you need me to tell you that. Very limited representation of national politics.

369
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:13,140
Try naming prominent trans politicians in the United States in the George W Bush years.

370
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:21,290
I'll wait next that I'll go home and I'll see you on Thursday because you won't find any.

371
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:27,320
And no long history of national organizing. This all predicts failure.

372
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:31,790
This all predicts. I'm sorry. Maybe you can try something in the courts.

373
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,940
Well, it does not predict what we have today. Okay.

374
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:42,840
Which compared to where I think your average trans activist or believer in human rights says we ought to be out there.

375
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:47,649
But it's also not the absolutely dire situation where at most what you have is things like the

376
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:51,580
bathroom bills being run as electoral gambits in order to increase turnout in North Carolina.

377
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:58,750
Bathroom fans like going into a bathroom that some undefined third party doesn't think is appropriate for your plight.

378
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:04,720
One of the great subtexts of this, by the way, is that if you'd asked me in 2004,

379
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:09,220
I also would not have thought we would have a number of Republican state legislatures entertaining bills at which

380
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:13,420
authority figures get to look at children's genitalia in order to decide whether or not they legitimately want to.

381
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:17,800
Sports contest. I think back to high school.

382
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:25,320
Me, it's like, wow, I would have had an issue. Okay, so significant advances and of course, significant backlash, right?

383
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:32,580
And the backlash is in part because you can you can easily gin up people who are kind of squishy and make them actually quite angry.

384
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:38,370
So the answer the answer is in the acronym, the astonishing growing acronym there.

385
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:48,990
I am so old. I remember when there was a sort of rapprochement between G and there was a big debate about whether B could be invited to the movement.

386
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,450
And in many ways, you could see the origins there,

387
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:55,500
because the history of the movement formation was the start of the game of musical lesbian movement.

388
00:38:56,610 --> 00:38:58,229
They consolidated over the AIDS.

389
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:03,210
AIDS sort of met everybody was doing something else in terms of political focus and organizing techniques for a while.

390
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:09,270
But then they started saying, we're actually essentially the movement against what you call sexual or sexual.

391
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:16,630
Which is how you get the expanding acronym of individual groups within a broader tent that didn't have to be.

392
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:20,999
You can imagine a different world in which the politics of HIV play out differently,

393
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:26,820
and you get a very strong gay movement focused around one thing, a lesbian movement focused on another thing, and everyone else is out in the cold.

394
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:33,810
You can imagine that social history. Instead, you get a construction of a social as well as a political organizing identity.

395
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:38,610
And that, argues the book, is what allowed us to start to have this sudden,

396
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:47,100
really remarkable and remarkably effective given the baseline resurgence of mobilization against a sexually sexual or sexual assault law.

397
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,620
So we're going to look into one dimension of that, which is gender affirming care.

398
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:59,440
So here do small groups, three or four people, 20 minutes.

399
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:04,060
Reporter You all know this is also jam board like in through.

400
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:12,650
That horrible thing whose name I don't like. Okay. So what you're going to do is you going to grab your groups.

401
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:20,660
You know, this legislative track, it's also all selected canvas. So whoever pulls up the jam board, you can also pull up the legislative tracker.

402
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:27,110
I'll show it to you as also to know. It's this now.

403
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:31,129
This is a broader tracker for a whole bunch of purposes.

404
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:32,480
It's the most thorough one I could find.

405
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:39,400
But what you want to do is start to get a sense just by eyeballing these maps of what's going on in these different states.

406
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:44,110
Right. So this is, you know, transgender exclusion that health service coverage prohibited.

407
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:47,740
Is this one of the states with a little spa and medical care events?

408
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:54,520
Those are the ones you had a reading where the states that are actually attempting to ban the performance of the care, Medicaid, does it cover it?

409
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:59,640
Right. So what you want to do is you want to kind of get a sense of it.

410
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:04,750
And what you do is you click on a state in this well and you get a summary.

411
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:13,840
And the people, no surprise, the people who put this together are in favor of things like gender affirming care, but it's very, very good.

412
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:19,570
And, you know, this score is essentially if you don't like the direction Michigan's going, you just subtract from tech.

413
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:29,530
So get a picture of the state laws very quickly. You don't need to dig into what each of these are and then you want to look into the politics of it.

414
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:34,560
Okay, so you get to start Googling. And on jam board.

415
00:41:35,310 --> 00:41:38,010
After scanning the tracker to understand what you're explaining,

416
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,980
you ought to try and get these questions, and you're going to find a lot of similarity, right?

417
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,520
I'm not expecting you to discover that trans advocates in Michigan and Ohio completely differently.

418
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:52,219
They might. But that should be your going an assumption. Of laws and pending bills.

419
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:55,220
Frank Gender affirming health care and gender affirming health care.

420
00:41:55,220 --> 00:42:01,040
Specifically, we're not doing high school athletes or toilets or the other things that are currently exercising the national political leadership.

421
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:08,720
Why do you think they're doing it this way? For example, why is it a huge issue in Ohio and not a huge issue in Michigan?

422
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:13,290
We're not that different. Part of the answer is, while Gretchen Whitmer is not to do it,

423
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:19,950
but one of the broader reasons that they push so much is not that it's okay and you're

424
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:23,309
going to go through that in order to start building up to a question for reflection,

425
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:26,370
which will that which we will then report out from the top.

426
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:31,410
So top questions, 20 minutes to go.

427
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:37,760
And he is jam hard to keep track of who grabbed which state so you know I fired the starting pistol out around the state.

428
00:42:37,770 --> 00:43:10,190
You want to do this on purpose?

429
00:43:21,700 --> 00:44:10,640
Now, this was exactly what I was learning about people.

430
00:44:12,190 --> 00:45:39,450
And, you know, and I just I don't know if I look at, oh, my God, I have to.

431
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:56,970
I was like, oh, boy.

432
00:46:09,590 --> 00:46:21,110
Yeah. All right.

433
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:49,620
Nic Robertson has been an eyewitness.

434
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:18,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

435
00:47:20,770 --> 00:47:25,100
I don't.

436
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:36,150
We have only. I don't care.

437
00:47:36,430 --> 00:48:59,450
You know, I think sometimes that's one of the things I don't think I know how to handle this.

438
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:59,930
So I think, you know, I guess I used to be all over this is that I don't know, some people the houses smell.

439
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:26,530
Oh, well, I mean, that is why I said you.

440
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:39,180
I heard it now.

441
00:50:45,830 --> 00:50:57,800
So what does this like?

442
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:03,770
What the [INAUDIBLE] is?

443
00:51:07,310 --> 00:51:20,550
What happens is that.

444
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:42,230
Yeah, I was there for you seconds.

445
00:51:53,740 --> 00:52:06,710
And I'm so sorry.

446
00:52:09,610 --> 00:52:30,480
I think it's your driver's license.

447
00:52:30,830 --> 00:52:44,220
Your friend. Oh, yes, you're right.

448
00:52:53,990 --> 00:53:12,040
I don't think they should look legislation I now.

449
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:32,770
That's right. You know.

450
00:53:39,070 --> 00:53:50,550
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

451
00:54:01,070 --> 00:54:31,440
I think that's one of the things that we're also hearing.

452
00:54:34,470 --> 00:56:14,660
Yeah. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

453
00:56:16,010 --> 00:56:52,010
But, like, I want to make sure that, you know, as I was trying to you this.

454
00:57:07,230 --> 00:57:14,490
Yeah. Yeah, I.

455
00:57:33,220 --> 00:58:31,300
And it's just like, you know, like I don't know how to answer your question about how much I really,

456
00:58:34,160 --> 00:59:11,370
really like this is so different from other sorts of things.

457
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:29,180
So I have no idea.

458
00:59:33,430 --> 01:00:31,870
You have to find out, you know, how many people are like, you know, your family had a lot of friends that you're not going to say,

459
01:00:43,690 --> 01:00:48,780
okay, it starts to get out and start talking about your questions might be radical.

460
01:00:48,900 --> 01:01:15,390
Some of them are like that.

461
01:01:20,340 --> 01:01:25,350
And then the other reason.

462
01:01:28,730 --> 01:01:47,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

463
01:01:49,250 --> 01:02:27,630
I thought I could find else else I was.

464
01:02:37,580 --> 01:03:00,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

465
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:45,040
Okay. Okay, one minute. Think of something interesting you learn on the question is, how did you find out about this study?

466
01:03:47,650 --> 01:04:03,720
I have heard say something like that.

467
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:14,670
Yeah, okay.

468
01:04:15,610 --> 01:04:23,129
So, so tempted.

469
01:04:23,130 --> 01:04:32,520
All these people started stretching. I'm so tempted to take one of them as an invitation to be called upon by the people right on the

470
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:40,860
back of reflecting so vigorously that I almost like to ask them to begin like guys in the far back,

471
01:04:41,430 --> 01:04:55,049
you seemed really into it if you want to kick off the conversation. So in Oregon, I think, you know,

472
01:04:55,050 --> 01:05:00,940
it's it's a pretty liberal state in general when it comes to rights for transgender

473
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:07,600
is it's seen as heavily in support of transgender rights to health care,

474
01:05:07,690 --> 01:05:17,659
to magazines. There have been recent movement as people are framing this, you know, alliance with caution and other things,

475
01:05:17,660 --> 01:05:27,500
kind of trying to tag along with that where you've got Republican legislatures and this is kind of working class positions differ.

476
01:05:28,340 --> 01:05:36,110
Republicans are kind of framing this as an offense where I don't want my female lawyer

477
01:05:36,410 --> 01:05:42,560
to compete with a male athlete that just is confirming this so you get the dance.

478
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:51,319
Whereas most Democrats and most Democrats and most of the legislature in Oregon probably use more as a mental health care issue,

479
01:05:51,320 --> 01:06:00,320
saying you can't attack these already vulnerable kids in their suicide, you know, etc.

480
01:06:02,750 --> 01:06:16,739
Do you think legislators are paying attention? So basically there is a health care issue out, so there's less room for opposition on gender.

481
01:06:16,740 --> 01:06:30,530
And here this week, I think they've got several acts that will help protect the rights for transgender folks at Oregon Equality Act 2000,

482
01:06:30,770 --> 01:06:35,930
protects them on housing discrimination in Medicaid,

483
01:06:36,230 --> 01:06:43,309
and it includes funding here on a legislative track tab pretty much across the board, you know,

484
01:06:43,310 --> 01:06:50,350
commercial insurance, private insurance, Medicare, Medicaid from discriminating anywhere.

485
01:06:50,540 --> 01:06:54,170
And a lot of times they have access to health care for transgender people.

486
01:06:56,030 --> 01:07:01,189
Just to kind of look what it sounds like in a sense, you get the nub of it is that you have a very clear partizan divide and they're making

487
01:07:01,190 --> 01:07:04,790
two very different framings of just what a fundamental issue we're talking about here.

488
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:10,040
Right. You project so well, but does this work?

489
01:07:11,090 --> 01:07:16,670
Does anyone want to try this? I think a real either a really red state or a really conflictual state would be fun.

490
01:07:21,140 --> 01:07:25,730
Does this thing actually work?

491
01:07:28,130 --> 01:07:31,300
Nicely done. Qualities that can help.

492
01:07:33,110 --> 01:07:44,380
So did Arkansas. The problem is that every state operating so very differently operates in the left, obviously,

493
01:07:45,650 --> 01:07:54,970
and right and in threatening is that that experimental treatment that we don't know enough about that is irreversible damage

494
01:07:55,400 --> 01:08:03,650
in order to image or make a decision about and that parents have the right to determine what's best for their children,

495
01:08:03,650 --> 01:08:09,680
at least from one side of the equation. Affirming parents don't seem to have that same right here.

496
01:08:10,130 --> 01:08:13,370
If you're not in a growing parent and definitely have that right to decide that

497
01:08:13,370 --> 01:08:20,089
your child shouldn't need any care or some transition without all the alternative.

498
01:08:20,090 --> 01:08:28,130
Parenting is that it's a medical issue which should be left to medical providers in a German and medical association so

499
01:08:28,790 --> 01:08:34,309
that Reagan was actually effective in getting in wonderful in the fight against the battle and was also the reason why the

500
01:08:34,310 --> 01:08:43,250
governor vetoed the bill was the argument that there should be a lot of medical associations that a German a primary care

501
01:08:43,250 --> 01:08:52,280
provider done being politicized argument to bring into you know so I notice this sort of stuff we're getting into here.

502
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:55,580
We're getting into the structure of the family. We're getting into the meaning of health care.

503
01:08:55,940 --> 01:09:02,719
We're getting into the definition of maturity. All of it wrapped up into a conversation about whether or not, you know,

504
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:06,680
a trans track star is sort of an abomination against the rules of high school sports.

505
01:09:08,710 --> 01:09:12,270
Anyone. Right. Said.

506
01:09:15,610 --> 01:09:26,229
So we end the state of Iowa. And this past summer they passed the House file two more one six and this was part building just has transcended

507
01:09:26,230 --> 01:09:32,920
girls and that was without transgender boys and that suggests that they have an advantage in sports,

508
01:09:33,250 --> 01:09:40,600
which lets them be banned from college since it's controlled by the regents and the state

509
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:48,819
universities and all high schools as well as there are no laws providing LGBTQ plus inclusive

510
01:09:48,820 --> 01:09:55,810
insurance protections for private health care and the city and Iowa order this ban using

511
01:09:55,870 --> 01:10:03,790
trans gendered girls they used in a way to say that it was for fairness in women's sports.

512
01:10:03,790 --> 01:10:08,230
However, as we all know, it's unnecessary and harmful.

513
01:10:09,070 --> 01:10:14,530
But since this is a Republican controlled, controlled state, it was able to get past the.

514
01:10:14,540 --> 01:10:17,319
Okay, that's super interesting. Does anyone have any immediate reaction?

515
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:23,110
So Iowa seems to have pondered that the other state legislature seemed surprised to see like seven foot tall,

516
01:10:23,110 --> 01:10:27,250
deep voiced basketball players switching over and taking over the women's varsity team.

517
01:10:28,990 --> 01:10:34,120
I assure you, this is not a huge actual problem in American athletics, but look at what's going on there.

518
01:10:37,860 --> 01:10:42,360
Right. We structured as a fair in high school sports. I think that's really distracting.

519
01:10:47,100 --> 01:10:51,000
Okay. Nobody took the bait. One last group. Anyone?

520
01:10:55,330 --> 01:11:02,050
Yes. I would like to be politically involved in moving it after my last performance.

521
01:11:06,340 --> 01:11:09,640
All right. So the state is Alabama.

522
01:11:10,780 --> 01:11:18,070
So we talked about that they banned conversion therapy for LGBTQ youth.

523
01:11:18,910 --> 01:11:25,719
We said that they're trying to frame it as a mental health instead of knowing what's going

524
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:32,060
on and that they don't have mental capacity to be able to discuss or make these decisions.

525
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:42,010
We said that the benefits of their framing was to sway voters away, to be against it,

526
01:11:42,550 --> 01:11:48,340
and their legislators are hoping to gain support from Republican voters.

527
01:11:48,850 --> 01:11:58,620
Yeah, we said positions like party Democrats are more in favor of the LGBTQ rights and they will fight to protect that.

528
01:11:58,990 --> 01:12:05,530
On the other hand, if those victims are more against it because it goes against the switch.

529
01:12:06,550 --> 01:12:09,940
So I want to leave you here with but we have a very straight partizan thing.

530
01:12:09,940 --> 01:12:16,030
And fundamentally, it's about a number of issues that people get very excited about, essentially about hierarchy and gender,

531
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:22,090
which are two things that really, really, really animate people in modern day America and humanity in general.

532
01:12:23,110 --> 01:12:26,440
But look at the way they're framing these different issues, you know,

533
01:12:26,980 --> 01:12:33,100
hulking transgender basketball players in Iowa versus arguments about maturity and mental health in Alabama,

534
01:12:34,180 --> 01:12:39,250
arguments in exactly the other direction about mental health in Oregon, combined with arguments about the practice of medicine.

535
01:12:39,790 --> 01:12:43,209
So what you're watching here is efforts to construct and reconstruct.

536
01:12:43,210 --> 01:12:50,230
Who are we talking about? Is it the eight foot basketball player and what exactly are the problems and fights over it?

537
01:12:50,260 --> 01:12:53,440
And I have to say, I didn't predict the particular variations he found at all.

538
01:12:53,470 --> 01:12:57,980
Neither the Iowa athletes nor the mental health arguments. Takeaways.

539
01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:02,780
This is what politics is. That's because politics is a particularly contentious form of life.
