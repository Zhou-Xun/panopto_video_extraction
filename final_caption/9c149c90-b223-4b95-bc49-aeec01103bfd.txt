1
00:00:01,088 --> 00:00:02,198
Joanna Kovacevich: Thanks for coming.

2
00:00:04,148 --> 00:00:04,778
Brandon Veremis: Good morning.

3
00:00:07,208 --> 00:00:08,378
Joanna Kovacevich: We are.

4
00:00:10,688 --> 00:00:12,188
Joanna Kovacevich: going to go ahead and jump in.

5
00:00:15,428 --> 00:00:16,328
Joanna Kovacevich: Let me get my.

6
00:00:17,798 --> 00:00:29,228
Joanna Kovacevich: Items here in order so welcome to this workshop on introducing Kritik a peer review tool and i'm just going to start off by saying that.

7
00:00:29,858 --> 00:00:43,538
Joanna Kovacevich: This is actually not a University of Michigan tool, this is a tool that we are piloting at School of Public Health, just in case that changes any of your plans to stay for the next hour and sit through this.

8
00:00:44,738 --> 00:00:56,108
Joanna Kovacevich: I can send the recording after but we certainly welcome you participating today as we introduce this new tool to our SPH colleagues and colleagues around campus who are joining us.

9
00:00:58,688 --> 00:01:05,558
Joanna Kovacevich: So, before we begin i'm live transcript is not enabled but i'm going to do that, right now.

10
00:01:08,018 --> 00:01:14,018
Joanna Kovacevich: so that you can participate and view a transcript that way.

11
00:01:14,468 --> 00:01:23,138
Joanna Kovacevich: For questions during the session we should be a small groups so feel free to post it in the chat I have my chat window open, you can unmute your microphone and speak at anytime.

12
00:01:23,738 --> 00:01:36,848
Joanna Kovacevich: With questions i'm going to say raising your hand is going to be the least effective way to get my attention just with my screen sharing, I have a little harder time seeing those come in and I don't want to miss any of your questions.

13
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:43,088
Joanna Kovacevich: My name is Joanna Kovacevich, I work with the School of Public Health instructional services team.

14
00:01:44,378 --> 00:01:56,858
Joanna Kovacevich: And we are just getting started with exploring and learning about this tool and are happy to share it and, at the end i'm going to be inviting our sth colleagues to.

15
00:01:58,058 --> 00:02:08,588
Joanna Kovacevich: contact us if they have any interest in piloting this tool for the fall, we have a couple of classes that are going to be doing it for different totally different types of peer review assignments.

16
00:02:09,668 --> 00:02:14,438
Joanna Kovacevich: But that will be an option that we can virtually only offer within sth.

17
00:02:17,378 --> 00:02:23,078
Joanna Kovacevich: So I just want to start with tell us a little bit about you what's your experience with peer review.

18
00:02:23,948 --> 00:02:25,868
Joanna Kovacevich: What types of peer review, do you use.

19
00:02:26,408 --> 00:02:37,208
Joanna Kovacevich: what's worked well for you, or what have you seen work well, or what hasn't worked well for you, or what you haven't seen work well and for this i'm going to share a idea boards link in the chat.

20
00:02:39,248 --> 00:02:46,448
Joanna Kovacevich: And I have each of these column questions broken out into columns and you can use that green plus button to add.

21
00:02:47,738 --> 00:02:53,528
Joanna Kovacevich: Feedback or notes and we're just gonna take a short break here and let you.

22
00:02:57,608 --> 00:03:09,098
Joanna Kovacevich: Post your thoughts and tell us a little bit about where you are with peer review or what challenges you're looking to overcome or anything about that so i'll just pause for a moment here.

23
00:05:04,568 --> 00:05:05,948
Joanna Kovacevich: No good notes coming in.

24
00:05:39,428 --> 00:05:44,588
Joanna Kovacevich: Alright, these are some really great notes Thank you all so much for contributing to this.

25
00:05:47,468 --> 00:05:58,628
Joanna Kovacevich: I hope some of the things that I hit on today address some of these but i'll revisit this to make sure to see if we can see if you know Kritik is a good fit.

26
00:06:08,258 --> 00:06:08,588
Great.

27
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:13,178
Joanna Kovacevich: So let's talk about what Kritik is.

28
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:29,438
Joanna Kovacevich: In the the sales pitch the product summary is a peer to peer interactive learning platform centered around student learning it's going to give students, the opportunity and practice, giving.

29
00:06:30,608 --> 00:06:37,088
Joanna Kovacevich: Giving motivational and critical feedback and receiving feedback from their peers.

30
00:06:39,668 --> 00:06:46,538
Joanna Kovacevich: This tool does have an lt I, it is not integrated into our canvas yet it's something we're pursuing.

31
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:57,998
Joanna Kovacevich: But our hope is to be able to integrate it into canvas so that those assignments can be launched into the Kritik activities.

32
00:06:59,738 --> 00:07:21,338
Joanna Kovacevich: So, in the broadest sense Kritik breaks down peer review into three stages, the create stage this is basically the assignment submission the evaluate stage, this is where you're the students submissions get sent out for that peer review step.

33
00:07:22,838 --> 00:07:25,838
Joanna Kovacevich: And the third step is bring sort of a.

34
00:07:28,028 --> 00:07:36,668
Joanna Kovacevich: process into place where, then the submitter that original creator gives feedback to their evaluator.

35
00:07:37,898 --> 00:07:45,518
Joanna Kovacevich: Have was your feedback even helpful to me or not, so you then they kind of get to evaluate the way evaluator.

36
00:07:46,088 --> 00:07:56,138
Joanna Kovacevich: So it's a very interesting process, they have set up we're going to talk a lot more about this and i'll also note because deadlines were one of the notes here.

37
00:07:56,648 --> 00:08:12,158
Joanna Kovacevich: That you can have the those distinct deadlines for each of these stages, which is a huge help when we're trying to keep an assignment moving along and making those expectations clear of when students need to have each phase done.

38
00:08:16,088 --> 00:08:24,698
Joanna Kovacevich: I wanted to really showcase some of the things that are unique about Kritik unique and impressive from our standpoint here in the school of public health.

39
00:08:25,778 --> 00:08:34,808
Joanna Kovacevich: um it's it's created to be anonymous so the anonymous reviewing of submissions and the anonymous feedback.

40
00:08:35,888 --> 00:08:45,158
Joanna Kovacevich: So that's how it's designed it doesn't have to be there are ways where students can make their identity visible but it's designed for this to be an anonymous process.

41
00:08:46,418 --> 00:09:03,188
Joanna Kovacevich: It offers different activity types individual peer review, where each student is submitting work group peer review or a group submits a project, and then the evaluation process is individual.

42
00:09:04,718 --> 00:09:16,118
Joanna Kovacevich: or they have an in group activity, and this would be if you want to personally designate who is reviewing whose work you put them in a group together they review one another's.

43
00:09:20,258 --> 00:09:30,968
Joanna Kovacevich: Kritik has a very unique tool called activity type called calibration this is, if you want to be for students start evaluating if you want to see.

44
00:09:31,838 --> 00:09:35,588
Joanna Kovacevich: How good they are how good of evaluators they are.

45
00:09:35,978 --> 00:09:53,138
Joanna Kovacevich: And this is something you know if we're working with masters students and we want to see kind of how much experience they've had previously at giving peer feedback the calibration exercises a great way to do this, you would basically set up different sample assignments.

46
00:09:54,278 --> 00:10:08,498
Joanna Kovacevich: That you have scored and then you sort of give those to the students in a in a exercise activity, they score the rubric and then it sort of sees how closely students aligned their.

47
00:10:09,608 --> 00:10:12,578
Joanna Kovacevich: rubric scores with your rubric scores.

48
00:10:17,138 --> 00:10:28,628
Joanna Kovacevich: Again, like I said you're going to be able to define the due dates for each stage the create evaluate and feedback stage, so you really kind of get to control and manage how long this whole process is taking.

49
00:10:30,158 --> 00:10:42,098
Joanna Kovacevich: You have flexible scoring rubrics you get to build your own rubric they come with a lot of templates that you can start with you can do a scoring rubric or a mastery rubric.

50
00:10:43,658 --> 00:10:55,028
Joanna Kovacevich: there's a lot of flexibility there and then even when the evaluators are scoring with your rubric they can give like half stars and things like that so we'll look at some of those things.

51
00:10:55,988 --> 00:11:14,678
Joanna Kovacevich: A really nice feature of Kritik is that you, as the instructor can go in after students have completed all those stages and spotlight exemplary work or exemplary evaluations, you can give one of both, and those are posted again anonymously.

52
00:11:15,728 --> 00:11:23,228
Joanna Kovacevich: As sort of hey here's an example of really great feedback and then your students can continue to learn that way.

53
00:11:24,848 --> 00:11:33,188
Joanna Kovacevich: You, as the instructor are going to have a view, where you can see the progress that where all your students are in in this three stage.

54
00:11:35,198 --> 00:11:37,958
Joanna Kovacevich: system this three stage setup.

55
00:11:39,248 --> 00:11:56,588
Joanna Kovacevich: And then, a very interesting thing about this system, this tool is that it allows students to sort of quote unquote level up as they get better at giving feedback that stage where students evaluate whether their peers.

56
00:11:57,638 --> 00:11:59,138
Joanna Kovacevich: Feedback was helpful or not.

57
00:12:00,398 --> 00:12:00,968
Joanna Kovacevich: kind of.

58
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:09,368
Joanna Kovacevich: can possibly increase a student's sort of rank as a good evaluator so going back to the comment of like students don't.

59
00:12:10,028 --> 00:12:28,508
Joanna Kovacevich: there's students don't get much out of peer review, one thing that could potentially be used as a motivator is the better feedback you give to your peers sort of the better your level gets as a reviewer so it's sort of a sort of a lenten motivator to.

60
00:12:29,828 --> 00:12:31,178
Joanna Kovacevich: give good feedback.

61
00:12:33,998 --> 00:12:36,518
Joanna Kovacevich: So we'll dive more deeply into these.

62
00:12:38,228 --> 00:12:47,318
Joanna Kovacevich: as well we won't dive too deeply, because these are a lot of options, but I just wanted to spotlight some things that were just really got our intention as impressive features.

63
00:12:49,598 --> 00:12:57,938
Joanna Kovacevich: So again, going back to that student experience are the three stages, create evaluate and feedback and then, if you want to.

64
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:03,188
Joanna Kovacevich: begin with a calibrate activity before they go into a full.

65
00:13:04,298 --> 00:13:06,128
Joanna Kovacevich: graded assignment, you can do that.

66
00:13:09,728 --> 00:13:17,948
Joanna Kovacevich: And then there's the instructor experience which you're going to be doing the activity setup and activity just the term they use for a full peer review assignment.

67
00:13:18,638 --> 00:13:34,148
Joanna Kovacevich: you're going to have the opportunity to do a grade review, you can go in and see and even make adjustments to scores that were given to students and then again you're going to be able to spotlight exemplary work.

68
00:13:36,998 --> 00:13:37,718
Joanna Kovacevich: let's look.

69
00:13:38,948 --> 00:13:42,398
Joanna Kovacevich: let's sort of dive into that three stage student experience.

70
00:13:44,588 --> 00:13:59,378
Joanna Kovacevich: The first stage is create students review their instructions and the rubric you provided and they're going to either create type in this text box or upload their submission, whether this is a paper an essay.

71
00:14:00,518 --> 00:14:04,298
Joanna Kovacevich: PowerPoint presentation and infographic whatever it is.

72
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:14,618
Joanna Kovacevich: On their dashboard they're going to get a little checkmark next to the create button, to know that they have.

73
00:14:17,408 --> 00:14:20,468
Joanna Kovacevich: submitted within the due date time.

74
00:14:21,758 --> 00:14:24,728
Joanna Kovacevich: Once that create deadline passes.

75
00:14:25,868 --> 00:14:40,358
Joanna Kovacevich: everyone's going to move to stage to the evaluation stage, this is where students anonymously score peers, based on the rubric and then provide constructive written feedback.

76
00:14:41,408 --> 00:14:43,418
Joanna Kovacevich: So i'm going to pull up.

77
00:14:45,488 --> 00:14:48,008
Joanna Kovacevich: So again, these are going to be your rubric items.

78
00:14:49,868 --> 00:14:59,708
Joanna Kovacevich: and students are going to be able to click on these two star them almost sort of like a yelp review for this student assignment.

79
00:15:01,508 --> 00:15:15,788
Joanna Kovacevich: One thing that's not demonstrated in this screenshot is that there is actually going to be a pop up panel to give students more detail about what each of these phases sort of means.

80
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:28,538
Joanna Kovacevich: there's also an opportunity when students get to this phase for you to give them some guidance, you can give them reminders of.

81
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:41,618
Joanna Kovacevich: You know, be sure to use phrases like this, or be sure to focus on these things in your feedback, you can kind of give them notes on what to look for or how to give feedback on this type of assignment.

82
00:15:42,758 --> 00:15:51,638
Joanna Kovacevich: So here they're starting on the rubric and here's where they're giving written feedback and both of these are required.

83
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:59,318
Joanna Kovacevich: So they're encouraged to give productive constructive feedback here.

84
00:16:02,588 --> 00:16:12,938
Joanna Kovacevich: And then the third stage after that evaluation deadline has passed, we move into the third stage feedback students now get to see those written evaluations.

85
00:16:13,868 --> 00:16:32,948
Joanna Kovacevich: And then they will give feedback on how motivational and how critical those that feedback was and it's just a for scale slider very discouraging discouraging motivational very motivational.

86
00:16:33,968 --> 00:16:44,738
Joanna Kovacevich: And then I can also leave text feedback for my reviewer of why I felt like this was unhelpful and discouraging that's optional to elaborate on that.

87
00:16:50,438 --> 00:16:53,828
Joanna Kovacevich: And then That completes that complete sort of the students cycle.

88
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:56,288
Joanna Kovacevich: On the back end.

89
00:16:57,458 --> 00:17:03,938
Joanna Kovacevich: you're going to be able to see where all of your students are in the stages so.

90
00:17:06,758 --> 00:17:15,728
Joanna Kovacevich: Here is the schedule over here on the right, this, this would be sort of the schedule that you set up before you launch the activity.

91
00:17:17,108 --> 00:17:18,638
Joanna Kovacevich: And then your students.

92
00:17:20,528 --> 00:17:30,008
Joanna Kovacevich: are going to be listed here and it's going to highlight where they are in each activity, the create stage the evaluate and the feedback and so you'll be able to get to see this.

93
00:17:30,848 --> 00:17:51,068
Joanna Kovacevich: This view by progress that drop down box actually changes to score so once all of the evaluations are completed, and that feedback, I can switch to this drop down to box to scoring and sort of sort students by their grade.

94
00:17:52,628 --> 00:18:04,448
Joanna Kovacevich: How they were scored and maybe that's where I can go during my grading phase it and look at you know who got low scores and was that fair and you know how are these reviewers.

95
00:18:05,048 --> 00:18:14,228
Joanna Kovacevich: How are your evaluators doing and then i'll be able to drill down on any of these student names to see more details about their submission who evaluated them.

96
00:18:14,888 --> 00:18:25,598
Joanna Kovacevich: What evaluation, they were given as the instructor you you don't have the anonymity you get to see that whole process from the back end.

97
00:18:29,228 --> 00:18:33,278
Joanna Kovacevich: Any questions so far on this student side.

98
00:18:39,878 --> 00:18:43,778
Joanna Kovacevich: feel free to use the chat or unmute your MIC if you have questions.

99
00:18:55,268 --> 00:19:00,068
Joanna Kovacevich: Otherwise, I will move to the will take a look at the instructor experience.

100
00:19:08,168 --> 00:19:11,408
Joanna Kovacevich: So for this we're going to go into a Kritik directly.

101
00:19:14,678 --> 00:19:16,988
Joanna Kovacevich: i'm gonna jump over to my other tab.

102
00:19:19,598 --> 00:19:20,768
Joanna Kovacevich: And, just a quick.

103
00:19:22,688 --> 00:19:32,588
Joanna Kovacevich: overview of the Kritik sort of layout there's the all courses, so this shows all of the courses, you know some similar to a canvas dashboard.

104
00:19:33,158 --> 00:19:37,178
Joanna Kovacevich: i'm going to go into my sandbox course, and now I have course information.

105
00:19:37,688 --> 00:19:58,688
Joanna Kovacevich: Which are some details and I would set up at the start my activities which will be all my peer review assignments my students would be here, they have a list of feature requests that you can submit and up vote a student view which primarily goes to some student help resources.

106
00:20:00,608 --> 00:20:09,128
Joanna Kovacevich: They have a help, which will take you to their documentation and over here on the right, I just want to highlight this message bubble, where you can get help it anytime.

107
00:20:10,448 --> 00:20:17,048
Joanna Kovacevich: With from a REP and that goes for instructors and for students who have questions or run into issues submitting.

108
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:21,248
Joanna Kovacevich: or understanding their assignments.

109
00:20:23,648 --> 00:20:40,838
Joanna Kovacevich: So, on my activities dashboard at the top here is spotlighted content I don't have any at the moment, but this is where that would appear, for your students, if you want to highlight any well done student work or really helpful peer feedback.

110
00:20:43,238 --> 00:20:45,968
Joanna Kovacevich: So here's an activity that is a draft.

111
00:20:47,618 --> 00:20:51,578
Joanna Kovacevich: And i'm gonna go ahead and open edit So you can see the.

112
00:20:52,598 --> 00:20:58,058
Joanna Kovacevich: assignment editor, which is what you'll see when you create a brand new activity.

113
00:20:59,468 --> 00:21:12,668
Joanna Kovacevich: This one has some things filled in so it's a little more simplified, so the very first thing I get to choose as my activity type individual group activity, which will then allow me to choose whether it's a.

114
00:21:13,748 --> 00:21:15,428
Joanna Kovacevich: Within group or.

115
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:24,998
Joanna Kovacevich: Working students working in groups sharing across the course and then the one that's missing here is the calibration exercise.

116
00:21:27,728 --> 00:21:44,978
Joanna Kovacevich: The assignment title and this assignment was pre populated into my course it's a good exercise just to give students, an opportunity to practice using the Kritik platform in a basically real no stakes low stakes no stakes practice.

117
00:21:46,148 --> 00:21:55,808
Joanna Kovacevich: So here's where I would name my assignment I would talk about what they need to do, why we're doing it anything they need to know.

118
00:21:58,418 --> 00:22:06,038
Joanna Kovacevich: What they should be submitting if there's a document that they should download with your instructions, there you can attach that.

119
00:22:08,738 --> 00:22:27,398
Joanna Kovacevich: evaluator notes, this is where I mentioned, you can give guidance to students when they get to that evaluation phase here by saying, by adding evaluator notes, and you can give reminders or attach you know some helpful tips or examples of helpful feedback.

120
00:22:31,298 --> 00:22:43,718
Joanna Kovacevich: rolling down, this is a custom rubric but you could change switch and Edit one of the templates that's here provided pre loaded by Kritik.

121
00:22:47,108 --> 00:22:52,208
Joanna Kovacevich: And this one, because it's just an introductory exercise it just has these three.

122
00:22:53,258 --> 00:22:56,528
Joanna Kovacevich: rubric items, but it can go as long.

123
00:22:57,578 --> 00:23:14,948
Joanna Kovacevich: Or, as many levels as you'd like notice here, the quality of writing these are stars and then the word count is sort of a met or not met so there's a lot of flexibility and how you build your rubric and then the weight is sort of how.

124
00:23:16,418 --> 00:23:19,328
Joanna Kovacevich: The the rubric score the rubric points.

125
00:23:20,648 --> 00:23:22,928
Joanna Kovacevich: They have all of these equal currently.

126
00:23:25,088 --> 00:23:38,438
Joanna Kovacevich: And then there's a lot of options with Kritik activities which really just as you can customize this to whatever type of activity you're trying to.

127
00:23:38,798 --> 00:23:52,358
Joanna Kovacevich: Create whatever experience you're trying to create for your students, you can do multiple topics if students, maybe they're not all writing an essay or doing a presentation on the same topic, maybe there's two or three topics.

128
00:23:54,158 --> 00:24:01,478
Joanna Kovacevich: and students are sort of giving presentations on different items, you can sort of divide those up right here in Kritik.

129
00:24:03,458 --> 00:24:11,498
Joanna Kovacevich: Allowing file attachments when they submit that as a something you can enable or disable similar to that setting in a canvas assignment.

130
00:24:13,028 --> 00:24:18,128
Joanna Kovacevich: Number of evaluations, how many peer reviews are you assigning to students.

131
00:24:20,558 --> 00:24:31,478
Joanna Kovacevich: And then grade wait how How does this activity factor in with other Kritik activities and for now we've been leaving these as just one point.

132
00:24:31,958 --> 00:24:47,588
Joanna Kovacevich: Because we're doing a lot of our grade waiting in our LM s inside of canvas because these activities are typically being calculated and balanced with other canvas activities and quizzes and things like that, and then you get to make some decisions about late submissions.

133
00:24:52,598 --> 00:24:56,078
Joanna Kovacevich: Once you save that activity, you get to create the schedule.

134
00:24:59,018 --> 00:25:10,718
Joanna Kovacevich: So here's where you get to set those distinct due dates and here is the where you get to set the release date is it a staggered release or is it.

135
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:16,088
Joanna Kovacevich: From the beginning of the Semester students can come in and start looking at this.

136
00:25:18,248 --> 00:25:23,258
Joanna Kovacevich: And so, here is a summary between the create and evaluate is four days.

137
00:25:24,278 --> 00:25:25,988
Joanna Kovacevich: I can make that lower or higher.

138
00:25:27,668 --> 00:25:30,938
Joanna Kovacevich: Kritik is giving me some tips here, as I go.

139
00:25:32,108 --> 00:25:45,398
Joanna Kovacevich: Two days, three days, how long do you want to offer for the evaluation phase, and then the feedback the feedback stage is probably the least amount of work it's just the two sliders where I say this was helpful or not helpful.

140
00:25:47,588 --> 00:25:58,538
Joanna Kovacevich: And then the grading, which is where the instructor comes in and sort of reviews those submissions and evaluations, to see if any corrections or adjustments should be made.

141
00:26:01,898 --> 00:26:05,348
Joanna Kovacevich: Once I have my due date set I can schedule this activity.

142
00:26:08,378 --> 00:26:12,248
Joanna Kovacevich: And when I come back to my activities dashboard this now is sort of a little.

143
00:26:13,388 --> 00:26:19,478
Joanna Kovacevich: card on my activities dashboard this means it's live and students are able to see this.

144
00:26:20,828 --> 00:26:28,628
Joanna Kovacevich: or i'm able to see this and students will be able to see that this will start in six days and there'll be able to sort of track their own progress.

145
00:26:33,248 --> 00:26:37,388
Joanna Kovacevich: Any questions so far as we sort of skim through some of those options.

146
00:26:52,538 --> 00:27:00,188
Joanna Kovacevich: So once i've built one you know if you have a scaffold at assignment maybe students are submitting pieces of a longer paper.

147
00:27:01,118 --> 00:27:12,968
Joanna Kovacevich: Or maybe they're submitting a draft of their presentation before a final presentation, you can duplicate this assignment and reuse some of the same settings and go in and change the schedule.

148
00:27:18,638 --> 00:27:26,438
Joanna Kovacevich: So, as we sort of dive deeper and deeper into the options it really becomes clear how flexible it really can be to sort of accommodate.

149
00:27:28,568 --> 00:27:30,308
Joanna Kovacevich: Different types of activities.

150
00:27:31,868 --> 00:27:32,888
Joanna Kovacevich: And things like that.

151
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:39,668
Joanna Kovacevich: i'm going to jump over to the grade scheme.

152
00:27:41,528 --> 00:27:59,048
Joanna Kovacevich: because sometimes when we do peer review we want to give students A grade for their assignment and then give a grade for their evaluation what Kritik does it combines this into a single score Now this is completely customizable by you.

153
00:28:00,068 --> 00:28:03,668
Joanna Kovacevich: But i'll show you the default that you get when you.

154
00:28:05,318 --> 00:28:06,788
Joanna Kovacevich: Create your course.

155
00:28:08,378 --> 00:28:09,848
Joanna Kovacevich: So by default.

156
00:28:11,438 --> 00:28:15,368
Joanna Kovacevich: Every activity, I create is going to use this grade scheme.

157
00:28:18,728 --> 00:28:30,038
Joanna Kovacevich: Half of the students grade is going to be how they their assignments submission how they did how they were scored on their submission by their peers.

158
00:28:31,718 --> 00:28:34,718
Joanna Kovacevich: The other half of their grade is how well.

159
00:28:36,578 --> 00:28:39,728
Joanna Kovacevich: They how well evaluations, they gave.

160
00:28:42,968 --> 00:28:52,328
Joanna Kovacevich: So their grading score when they score the rubric it's determined by how accurately a student has evaluated their peer according to the activity rubric.

161
00:28:54,098 --> 00:29:02,738
Joanna Kovacevich: And then the written is how motivational and critical students written evaluation has been perceived by their peers.

162
00:29:05,468 --> 00:29:15,308
Joanna Kovacevich: And then feedback they get 10% of their grade from just completing the feedback stage, so I could adjust that and lower it.

163
00:29:16,358 --> 00:29:24,098
Joanna Kovacevich: But we want to encourage students to give that feedback because that's going to help their peers become better evaluators.

164
00:29:39,788 --> 00:29:42,638
Joanna Kovacevich: So what other questions do you have.

165
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:48,998
Joanna Kovacevich: About Kritik i'm gonna pause my share so I can review.

166
00:29:54,008 --> 00:29:57,998
Joanna Kovacevich: I want to review our idea boards, the notes, we made so.

167
00:30:04,388 --> 00:30:09,878
Joanna Kovacevich: Now you kind of have put sort of what hasn't worked well or things that you've wanted.

168
00:30:11,228 --> 00:30:20,558
Joanna Kovacevich: I wanted to do with peer review does this sort of help answer questions about whether this might be a good fit or not, or do you have additional questions.

169
00:30:23,588 --> 00:30:26,588
Joanna Kovacevich: platforms don't support the assessment of the assessors.

170
00:30:27,908 --> 00:30:28,778
Joanna Kovacevich: yep so that's.

171
00:30:31,478 --> 00:30:35,318
Joanna Kovacevich: going to be the feedback phase that feedback stage.

172
00:30:36,848 --> 00:30:53,048
Joanna Kovacevich: And that feedback that is given, there are things that go into that the students grading power when we talked about students can level up to be considered better evaluators.

173
00:30:54,578 --> 00:31:02,738
Joanna Kovacevich: When you get feedback from your peers that you give helpful feedback that's one thing that helps you level up as well.

174
00:31:03,818 --> 00:31:07,028
Joanna Kovacevich: So it's a very interesting sort of feature.

175
00:31:08,618 --> 00:31:21,098
Joanna Kovacevich: canvas doesn't support different due dates that's right and so that's really nice, we can sort of set all these separate due dates Google form this slightly unstable and requires processing by instructors.

176
00:31:25,208 --> 00:31:28,208
Joanna Kovacevich: Training students on giving good feedback is difficult that's right.

177
00:31:31,628 --> 00:31:42,608
Joanna Kovacevich: yeah because that's a big part of it is and so that's something that helps with the calibration activity is Where are you at and what should we work on and then giving that evaluator.

178
00:31:43,628 --> 00:31:51,728
Joanna Kovacevich: The evaluator notes of things they should keep in mind you kind of put that at the front of their mind of don't forget these things we talked about.

179
00:31:54,458 --> 00:32:02,408
Joanna Kovacevich: You even with guidance and rubric students don't feel like they get much out of peer review yeah understandable and so, how can we make it better and we make it better.

180
00:32:03,098 --> 00:32:15,008
Joanna Kovacevich: One of the ways by giving them practice at it having that evaluation that sorry that feedback phase, so that they know the feedback they're giving is helpful or not.

181
00:32:17,618 --> 00:32:23,768
Joanna Kovacevich: And then that level up you know they earn something when they learn to give good feedback.

182
00:32:25,238 --> 00:32:27,428
Joanna Kovacevich: Any data export tools.

183
00:32:30,578 --> 00:32:36,278
Joanna Kovacevich: Yes, I believe there are several ways to export data.

184
00:32:39,158 --> 00:32:42,218
Joanna Kovacevich: I think I might actually be confusing that with a different tool sorry.

185
00:32:43,928 --> 00:32:54,098
Joanna Kovacevich: I can look into that brandon thanks for that question, what would you be looking for specifically would it be grades, or would you want to see sort of that.

186
00:32:56,468 --> 00:32:57,398
Joanna Kovacevich: review.

187
00:32:58,628 --> 00:33:00,758
Joanna Kovacevich: process would you want to export that.

188
00:33:00,878 --> 00:33:01,568
Brandon Veremis: I mean.

189
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:03,998
Brandon Veremis: anything.

190
00:33:05,408 --> 00:33:07,448
Joanna Kovacevich: But look what's available yeah yeah yeah.

191
00:33:08,378 --> 00:33:21,698
Joanna Kovacevich: yeah let me check some of the help documentation and then in the follow up when I share the slides and the recording hopefully I will have been able to find some links that say what kind of data exports are available.

192
00:33:22,118 --> 00:33:23,198
Brandon Veremis: Great Thank you very much.

193
00:33:23,378 --> 00:33:23,948
Absolutely.

194
00:33:24,968 --> 00:33:33,398
Frederique Laubepin: And jonah if I can chime in a exporting things like you know scores gradebook type stuff i'm pretty sure.

195
00:33:34,778 --> 00:33:43,538
Frederique Laubepin: is available, what I don't know we can do is do like a batch download of submissions, for example, or.

196
00:33:45,128 --> 00:33:46,118
Frederique Laubepin: Right so.

197
00:33:47,678 --> 00:33:51,728
Frederique Laubepin: yeah that kind of stuff may not be may not be possible.

198
00:33:52,778 --> 00:33:56,288
Brandon Veremis: Okay yeah i'd certainly be interested in knowing about that.

199
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:57,758
Brandon Veremis: Thank you.

200
00:33:58,958 --> 00:34:01,508
Joanna Kovacevich: Absolutely pricing great question.

201
00:34:02,948 --> 00:34:03,398
Joanna Kovacevich: The.

202
00:34:04,958 --> 00:34:08,678
Joanna Kovacevich: During our pilot what we have is.

203
00:34:09,938 --> 00:34:23,558
Joanna Kovacevich: You, as the instructor and collaborators, those are free accounts, where the pricing comes in, is a per student when you invite them and that appears to be $24 per student.

204
00:34:24,638 --> 00:34:38,318
Joanna Kovacevich: And it's set up to charge the student when you invite them when they create their account, however we're working with a REP so that we can cover the cost during our pilot.

205
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:45,248
Joanna Kovacevich: So we'd be happy to send them that contact information to you Frederick was there anything you want to add there.

206
00:34:46,868 --> 00:34:59,678
Frederique Laubepin: Oh yeah I think the the so it starts at 24 depending on the number of students or you know, so how widely you might be looking at implementing it.

207
00:35:00,218 --> 00:35:14,048
Frederique Laubepin: The price would go down, and I think it can go down pretty substantially, which brings me to another point right, so we are piloting the stewardess pH hopefully it goes well and we may you know our next step would be to.

208
00:35:15,098 --> 00:35:20,648
Frederique Laubepin: You know, do some kind of contract with them if you were in a similar situation where you.

209
00:35:22,298 --> 00:35:25,658
Frederique Laubepin: You know this is a tool that you think would be helpful to your unit.

210
00:35:26,918 --> 00:35:32,678
Frederique Laubepin: You know, pleased is so first of all we're happy to put you in touch with our you know Kritik rep.

211
00:35:33,848 --> 00:35:44,858
Frederique Laubepin: and facilitate that connection, but we would also be super happy to have conversations about how we can combine we can join forces to negotiate, you know.

212
00:35:45,878 --> 00:35:50,228
Frederique Laubepin: advantageous pricing for our units so.

213
00:35:51,488 --> 00:35:54,038
Frederique Laubepin: You know just just wanted to put this out there.

214
00:35:57,218 --> 00:36:02,558
Joanna Kovacevich: And so, for our SP H participants today if this sounds like something you want to explore.

215
00:36:03,818 --> 00:36:09,548
Joanna Kovacevich: send us an email we'd love to kind of set up some of those initial discussion meetings.

216
00:36:14,618 --> 00:36:18,728
Joanna Kovacevich: To talk about what kind of assignments, you want to do and whether you want to do a fall pilot.

217
00:36:20,708 --> 00:36:34,298
Joanna Kovacevich: To where we might need to sort of get rolling on that soon for those For those of you that aren't as pH feel free to use that email address to get in touch with us, if you have questions or need anything.

218
00:36:36,968 --> 00:36:44,318
Joanna Kovacevich: Or, if you want to have your it or learning instructional team contact us.

219
00:36:48,428 --> 00:36:49,778
Frederique Laubepin: And just just know.

220
00:36:50,798 --> 00:36:59,918
Frederique Laubepin: You know, obviously we were just dipping our toes in in the Kritik waters we're hoping that this is a successful pilot.

221
00:37:00,638 --> 00:37:10,988
Frederique Laubepin: we're planning on using it in at least two different courses pretty different use cases, so one is a more traditional you know you have a scaffolding.

222
00:37:11,708 --> 00:37:28,178
Frederique Laubepin: Projects throughout the throughout the term you know so paper assignment writing assignment, the other one is any biostatistics class with labs so you know very different type of assignment.

223
00:37:29,978 --> 00:37:35,888
Frederique Laubepin: One of the demos, we attended or webinars were attended with Kritik the instructor.

224
00:37:37,268 --> 00:37:42,668
Frederique Laubepin: Was teaching very large classes of something like 1500 students, without any.

225
00:37:45,518 --> 00:37:49,688
Frederique Laubepin: or anything and she was using Kritik to assign.

226
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:51,968
Frederique Laubepin: You know her students.

227
00:37:53,138 --> 00:37:53,948
Frederique Laubepin: Little.

228
00:37:55,058 --> 00:37:59,708
Frederique Laubepin: scenarios where it's you know she I think she called a teacher teacher friend or.

229
00:38:00,248 --> 00:38:09,368
Frederique Laubepin: You know where she she would give them a little scenario, and then they would have to record themselves right, so a video recording of them explaining to a friend or a family member.

230
00:38:10,028 --> 00:38:23,678
Frederique Laubepin: Whatever concept, she had assigned to them, and this is where the you know what jonah was talking about in terms of the you know different topics, the class would be randomly assigned you know, a student would be randomly assigned to one of these.

231
00:38:24,998 --> 00:38:30,488
Frederique Laubepin: topics and then would you know submit video.

232
00:38:32,078 --> 00:38:44,438
Frederique Laubepin: creations, so the the platform is really pretty pretty flexible and addresses a lot of the pain points that instructors have been telling us.

233
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:55,538
Frederique Laubepin: You know they're encountering when they are trying to do peer reviews in their in their courses so we're hopeful that this is a tool that might solve a lot of the problems.

234
00:39:02,258 --> 00:39:02,948
Absolutely.

235
00:39:05,708 --> 00:39:08,378
Joanna Kovacevich: i'm happy to answer additional questions if you have any.
