1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:05,640
You recently. I can't get over. Just go out into the world without any.

2
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:20,230
I'm not so sure because it's like it makes me uncomfortable. And I really don't like the ones where we don't have a good exercise.

3
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:27,890
That is totally true. If I find it again, I'll say, yeah, yeah.

4
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:39,110
Well, yeah, actually, the other the other male, the 14 year old is like off with like two huge backpacks or whatever.

5
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,859
Oh, that's right. They're not even books.

6
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:47,300
They don't. Oh, yeah, yeah.

7
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:31,580
Pretty good. Here's the story.

8
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:39,790
Big were truly our. It means that I created town.

9
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:44,230
Favorite. But there are some criminals.

10
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:53,080
It's just that yesterday was so stunning and so much of a stretch to have a lot of industry.

11
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:58,570
So, yeah, I think that's a really. Where is that?

12
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:03,100
It's on Kingsley itself. Near the church.

13
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:06,700
Oh, it's glorious. It's such a rich heritage. Yeah. Yeah.

14
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,749
You know, I. You know, it's a quite a feeling.

15
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:16,160
I do. And like these. These few weeks are the ones when I'm like.

16
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:23,060
Yeah, I probably do on my wall. Welcome to liberty all the time.

17
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:33,340
Most vibrant colors like this are like a pool house in the back.

18
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,870
You want to know what can I do for you? But I think this one. I love it.

19
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:49,930
I used to live right down. What I was.

20
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:58,130
So, like, no different from athletes.

21
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:09,650
Yeah. Yeah. I used this to turn on the projector.

22
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:26,489
Oh, yes, that's right. There's a couple of my around my neighborhood that are just I don't even know what the color is.

23
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:31,720
It's just like this beautiful orange magenta fire for and.

24
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:59,390
Yeah. So we can answer the panel as high as have 15.

25
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,310
All right, well, let's start. And then.

26
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:15,830
You have time. Now we can chat more. And then I have some rearranging of our weeks to solve structure based on that.

27
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:20,930
I know you have a preference for more of.

28
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:27,040
I don't remember the response that comes up. I think there is.

29
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:32,460
And also. You know, pass the torch to.

30
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:37,470
Oh, they yell. Okay.

31
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:46,540
So I kind of approach this as an opportunity to dove into this area and after trying to write it on the board of like,

32
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:55,750
Oh, I wonder what the literature is saying. So this is a fun learning opportunity for me and I am excited to share some of what I found with you.

33
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:05,049
So pretty much the objectives were to describe factors influencing immigrant and asylum seeker mental

34
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:10,480
health and sort of identify what are the frameworks and measures and potential future directions.

35
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:17,990
I wanted to start as I like looking at this topic.

36
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:26,080
I was just reflecting, you know, on how important it might be for me to consider my position as I approach this community.

37
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:30,640
I'm bicultural. I grew up here. I was born.

38
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,980
My mom's from here. My dad's from Colombia.

39
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:41,950
And I've been privileged in that. We've I've been visiting my family there since I was like eight months old because my dad's the only one here.

40
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,709
And from a young age,

41
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:52,840
I was kind of exposed to internal displaced populations and kind of living in a in a violent like it goes through ways of violence.

42
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,890
Colombia does anyway.

43
00:05:54,040 --> 00:06:03,760
So it's sort of the generalized violence we read about could definitely relate to that and kind of knowing those contexts from a young age.

44
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:10,330
Lots of privileges on my end. I have U.S. citizenship, so that changes a lot.

45
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:14,980
Our really Western academic training.

46
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:21,500
I do get to speak Spanish at home and I'm light skinned.

47
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,169
My mom and I are the only white ones,

48
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:31,290
so it's a privilege I've been really aware of since at a young age because my brothers and sisters and dad aren't.

49
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:37,360
And I had the privilege of serving in the Peace Corps for three years in a Salvadoran.

50
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,950
And that's where I got exposed to the asylum seeker situation.

51
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:45,699
And then just thinking about mental health in my own family,

52
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:53,139
it's been a real taboo and some finally some diagnoses for some of our family members that came really late.

53
00:06:53,140 --> 00:07:02,500
But I was just trying to kind of lay down these potential biases and things that I should be thinking about when working with the population.

54
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:07,420
And then also my goals kind of intersected with my biases.

55
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:14,920
Like I see my role as being able to maybe share science with the community and really keep that intersectionality lens or so.

56
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,430
We're all lumped together in this enormous, heterogeneous group,

57
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:27,610
and everybody's pathway to everybody's immigration story is different, and the subsequent generation stories are different.

58
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:31,450
So just want to keep that in the forefront.

59
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:40,270
And then I do want research agendas to create research agendas that are more community driven, that honor,

60
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:50,060
different cultural frameworks and ways of knowing and target multiple levels of influence, which in this literature looks tough.

61
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:58,390
I said some articles to just focus on one particular context because we are so heterogeneous.

62
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:05,440
So from the Northern Triangle that refers to as Salvador.

63
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,440
Oh, I don't know why it's cut off from us again.

64
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:19,580
Or is it just this? You didn't notice I zeroed in on this one.

65
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:30,500
Oh, thank you for the hat. Thank you, guys. Let me take this off, because it's like making its plastic raincoat shuffle.

66
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:39,380
So the northern triangle refers to Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras.

67
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:45,360
And this is does not do justice to the historical context of the region.

68
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:53,310
This is kind of just a really boiled down some some points to keep in mind when thinking about why like what's happening here?

69
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:58,730
Why are people migrating from this area? Spanish colonization.

70
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:02,929
I'm not as familiar with what happened in Guatemala and Honduras,

71
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:08,719
but in El Salvador that turned into like 14 families literally in the whole

72
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,280
country holding power and everybody else was living pretty much in serfdom.

73
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,750
There were some revolts that led to this genocide of the native population in El Salvador.

74
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:27,110
So obviously A happened between this and this, but it's just too much too for this particular presentation.

75
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:32,870
But definitely has created the environment that is the Northern Triangle.

76
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:36,110
Now in the.

77
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:46,910
I think one of the papers I set about the youth that didn't leave the Northern Triangle did talk about, you know, the recent civil wars in the area.

78
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,420
Like, I mean, this is I mean, this is my generation.

79
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:57,800
And my husband was a war babies. He was born in this time, but not that long ago.

80
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:03,830
But and extremely like just violent and lots of human rights violations.

81
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:08,970
I thought the article didn't really touch on that much of the U.S. involvement in these contexts,

82
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:15,260
though funding right wing government and death squads in El Salvador,

83
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:26,180
similarly in Guatemala, backing the coup of a democratically elected president that led to a genocide by the military of the native population there.

84
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,719
Under duress, they backed the Contras.

85
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:37,430
And I think this is all kind of the anti-communist kind of wave, and it's a pattern they have in all of Latin America.

86
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:45,140
And so I just thought that was important because it I think it influences the whole region, too, not just the.

87
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:51,960
Yeah. And then because of where they are geographically, they're on the drug route between South America,

88
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,720
North America, U.S. and Europe are like the largest consumers of drugs.

89
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:00,090
And so that kind of compounds this issue.

90
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:12,930
And then there's, of course, tons of general drug related violence with that trade gains and mass incarceration and the gains.

91
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:18,780
So during this period, there is a huge flood of migration to the U.S. during the civil wars.

92
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:25,559
And if they went to communities where, you know, gangs was sort of a protective thing or not an optional thing,

93
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:30,960
like in Los Angeles, the Mara Salvatrucha, 13 and 18 street gangs are from there.

94
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,759
And then with deportations, they're now pretty dominant gangs.

95
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:47,640
And in the Northern Triangle, a lot of femicide and natural disasters also are contributing to the the push, but these push factors.

96
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:59,220
And then just for a sense of how big this is, between 2018 and 2021, they estimated almost half a million annual departures just from this area.

97
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:10,570
I learned some terms. Things are these terms are sometimes used entertainment interchangeably, but they mean really different things.

98
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:17,710
So immigrants really refers to people that decide to go to resettle somewhere and to stay there.

99
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:22,960
And here they go through insane vetting processes to be able to do that.

100
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:28,480
It's really costly. When I did it with my husband, everything was in English.

101
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:37,240
So if you don't know English, you know, paying for lawyers to help you with a process like that and the time frames, there's a really long time.

102
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:44,470
But once you have it, you can go back and forth and you have a lot of freedoms and there's pathways to residency and citizenship.

103
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:53,800
Migrants typically refers to people that are traveling around for work, so it's more like economically driven.

104
00:12:54,550 --> 00:13:05,790
And then asylum seekers, they have to enter the destination they're going to to be able to petition for refugee status.

105
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:09,710
This is pretty much how it works. They can't do anything in advance.

106
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:11,380
They have to show up here first.

107
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:23,589
And so during this whole crisis, what was really interesting is that the the government was calling them like illegal illegal people,

108
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:30,190
illegal immigrants, when it's not illegal to cross the border, to ask for asylum.

109
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:35,080
And it's actually like U.S. and international law that you have to hear the cases of of these people.

110
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:47,500
And I will get into that a little later. But so asylum seekers are usually also fleeing some sort of violence or persecution,

111
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:53,830
but they have to make their case when they get here and they have to prove that it's true, which can be very hard.

112
00:13:54,940 --> 00:14:02,980
Refugees, they are fleeing violence or persecution as well, but they are given they're protected under international law.

113
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:09,130
And at least in the United States, if you're given refugee status, you do have some sort of pathway to citizenship.

114
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:13,630
I mean, not citizenship, but probably residency, some sort of lawful pathway to be here.

115
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:25,360
And you have access to two different services. Research principles that came up in the literature, which I thought were important to think about.

116
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:32,350
It's a human rights approach to how and health equity approach to how can we remove these penalizing

117
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:40,000
structures that are blocking immigrants from things that impact their their access to health work,

118
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:45,280
safe, safe work, etc.,

119
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:51,520
and sort of the ethics of working with this group, needing to be especially cautious if you're working with, for example,

120
00:14:51,520 --> 00:15:00,400
undocumented populations in terms of being extra cautious with that data and making sure it doesn't go into the wrong hands.

121
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:10,030
And just in general, not propagating more rhetoric around like blaming people for being here,

122
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:21,580
more othering and discriminatory approaches because of the complexity of migration, something that's likely not going to go away.

123
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:32,020
I don't think a lot of different people need to be at the table or our policy people, our lawyers, our health people or epidemiologists.

124
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:41,080
It's something that's going to take a lot of different perspectives to be able to help improve how we treat immigrants and asylum seekers.

125
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:44,500
And of course, it has economic implications.

126
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:49,990
And one reminder that I appreciate was to remember the people that are left behind, the people they don't come.

127
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:55,000
And that's a whole other group of people to be thinking about.

128
00:15:57,650 --> 00:16:02,360
This is one model that showed the different migration phases.

129
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,709
And I think something that stuck out to me about this was it's important.

130
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:12,560
But, you know, being a migrant isn't what's causing your health problems, right?

131
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:19,790
It's all the the exposure that you have in in the process of migration that can impact your health and your mental health.

132
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:25,340
So it just divides it up by migration. What's causing it?

133
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:32,270
I thought this was interesting thinking about their epidemiological profile before they leave and when they arrive,

134
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:39,620
and then different aspects of when they're in migration and then to the time

135
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,970
getting to their destination and which we'll talk about in the next slides.

136
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:47,750
And then this is kind of a phase that I don't really touch on in this,

137
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:53,569
but it is like what happens to the people that are deported and haven't been there for many,

138
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:56,410
many years or their children don't even know,

139
00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:05,060
like in some alert and that operative like what happens to them and their health in terms of do they still have family there or.

140
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:09,680
Yeah, it's so it can be a full circle.

141
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:19,280
So now focusing in on youth from the Northern Triangle in that pre migration phase.

142
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:25,430
So the ones that didn't leave just talked about their resilience factors as being,

143
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:30,200
you know, staying positive, wanting to get their education no matter what.

144
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:38,870
They had really strong networks in country and from the people that were in the States or transnationally,

145
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:43,430
and they engaged in their community based groups, youth groups.

146
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:51,830
And they talked about this lack of health was was just living without any sort of safety and security and how that impacted their well-being.

147
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:57,530
So violence is a daily common occurrence, constantly living in fear,

148
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:05,180
experiencing victimization and just lacking any sort of protection from the government, from the police, the military, anybody.

149
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:10,580
So just thinking about if this is your experience, like since birth,

150
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:17,330
this is the environment you're growing up in, like how does that impact your your health and your mental health?

151
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:29,390
And then from those that migrated, this is just a qualitative study that was done with youth with the had arrived within three years.

152
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,390
They talked about natural disasters,

153
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:39,170
serious injury accidents and witnessing violence as the third traumatic events that they experienced before leaving.

154
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:44,870
And then another thing that may impact youth mental health is they don't necessarily get to

155
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:50,240
decide if they're going to they don't have a say in the decision of of migrating or immigrating.

156
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:57,049
And it could potentially involve some sort of family separation, whoever they're living with,

157
00:18:57,050 --> 00:19:02,210
or if they go alone like unaccompanied minors and maybe have family waiting for them.

158
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,470
So all of these can be pretty traumatic factors.

159
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:16,220
During migration. The same study reported just experiencing a witnessing physical assault.

160
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:32,120
And then post migration. So they've made it to the U.S. and now they're entering a society that has really anti-immigrant rhetoric overall.

161
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:39,260
So like immigrants are burned into the economy, burned into the system.

162
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,890
A lot of like. They really are. They really what are they really fleeing?

163
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:52,190
And kind of a forgetfulness of why the situation has come to pass.

164
00:19:54,560 --> 00:20:00,350
And so and then all these sort of, I would say like legal violence against immigrants.

165
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:05,540
So the Title 42 Public Health Law was kind of abused during COVID 19.

166
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:13,190
It it it deported unaccompanied minors and it forced all asylum seekers to wait in Mexico.

167
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:19,150
And there is the migrant protection protocols. It did a similar thing.

168
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:22,310
It just it didn't let asylum seekers cross the border.

169
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:32,000
And this put a lot of people in a lot of danger, like for sexual exploitation or death or trafficking on the Mexico side of the border.

170
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:41,450
And then the zero tolerance policy that was the family separation policy that happened, which is people have equated to, you know,

171
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:50,059
form of torture, essentially separating children from their parents when they got to the border as a way to discourage.

172
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:54,980
And we don't there's not a lot of data about what happened to unaccompanied children.

173
00:20:55,460 --> 00:21:02,750
Like if they were deported to Mexico without a caregiver, know what happened to them on the state side,

174
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:08,150
some of them were put into our systems here, like the foster care system.

175
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:14,420
And I think there's still some they haven't located down to reunite with their family members.

176
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:24,920
So talking about traumatic events, I don't I it's hard to understand how this happened.

177
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:32,450
And then for profit detention centers, that's a whole other bag of worms.

178
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:37,120
They also tend to subcontract out their medical health services.

179
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:45,890
So all of this is really difficult to sort of track on how immigrants are being treated in these in these areas as well.

180
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:54,350
And then I already mentioned like another form of legal violence here. I mean, political violence is like gang bang membership.

181
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:02,520
And then traumatic events reported by Northern Triangle youth, again included once even after they got here,

182
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,940
was witnessing violence and experiencing serious accident or injury.

183
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:14,130
So we can just start to imagine how all these events across the migration process may be impacting their mental health and well-being.

184
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:22,799
And then on top of that, they're going through all these other changes to to their family life that we already talked about,

185
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:27,490
separating separation or perhaps reunification, the rules and roles.

186
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:31,260
So that's really when like acculturation starts playing, taking a role.

187
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:36,959
You know, adolescents might be a culture eating a lot faster than their parents.

188
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,100
If they're at school, for example, they're learning the language, they're learning the culture.

189
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:45,629
And so that changes the dynamic.

190
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:52,560
They may be picking up some cultural values here that may go against a little bit what their parents cultural values are.

191
00:22:52,950 --> 00:23:00,599
So that can kind of create some stress there. They might be needing to interpret for their parents if their parents haven't learned

192
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:04,829
the language at a time when they're trying to become independent from their family,

193
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:08,280
there's like this still this real interdependence.

194
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,770
And so that kind of has been talked about in the literature is causing a culture of stress.

195
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:25,420
And then there's the economic violence. Like if their parents are in really, you know, not in jobs that aren't protected.

196
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:35,280
Like, I think during COVID, all of like the meatpacking plants, for example, that were not putting in any safety measures for for those workers.

197
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:45,810
And there's lots of wage theft issues with this population, and that also can just create stress at home.

198
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,200
And then, of course, we already talked about documentation status,

199
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:58,139
how that that limits greatly limits their their ability to access any kind of service for youth,

200
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:03,060
you know, their change and friends who they left behind. Hopefully, they're making new friends, but that's a huge change.

201
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:10,259
What adult life plans that they have before they were forced to leave the learning, the language.

202
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:17,250
And then what's the context of the receiving community? It's a new culture, but what is its attitudes towards immigrants?

203
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:22,740
What if they're moving to like a more nontraditional immigrant destination?

204
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:29,250
They talk about having like enclave enclave communities that can be protective.

205
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:35,360
But now that's not the experience of everybody. And then.

206
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:45,780
Okay, so now they're in the US. It's a huge populated Latino population, 18.9%, but still an ethnic minority and a pretty racialized society.

207
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:51,440
In 2019, they said 18.6 million of latinxs.

208
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:56,770
There are 18.6 million Latinx youth under the age of 18.

209
00:24:56,790 --> 00:25:02,639
Here, 26% of those. So that made up about 26% of the total U.S. child population.

210
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:09,960
So it's a huge it's a pretty big population. And then 51% of them were were immigrants or lived with immigrant families.

211
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,500
And as I mentioned, once they're here,

212
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:20,670
they're they're exposed to different kinds of sexual violence or not that just physical, outright generalized violence.

213
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:27,930
But where they're coming from is it's different than that, but it's still a different form of violence.

214
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:31,470
So this was from the rebel front, this article,

215
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:39,870
and she provided a conceptual model for othering and discrimination and how that impacts immigrant health.

216
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:44,459
So othering is a marginalization process, right?

217
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:53,070
Like where we're kind of putting people on a hierarchy or our racial hierarchy in the U.S. and and she kind of.

218
00:25:54,370 --> 00:26:04,600
Draw out how she thought that might impact health by putting them on some sort of racial ethnic studies and then how that causes stress,

219
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:15,850
which can impact biological processes. She also highlights discrimination and how that impacts socioeconomic status and also stress.

220
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:22,420
I like the the historical, socio cultural, political context being in there.

221
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:31,360
And yeah, the immigration box is hard with these models because it's like talking about pre migration during and post-event.

222
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:36,730
I even saw one that just like had it as like a spear going through the individual.

223
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:41,050
Like it's hard to get to.

224
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:45,820
But I do like how it kind of this he or she has it as an arrow to like more proximate.

225
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:47,409
But yeah,

226
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:59,440
that's kind of a hard thing to I found in the models to try to portray like because it's not so linear all the the different stressors you know.

227
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:08,590
Mental health. So probably not surprisingly something is up with her with our next makes here.

228
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:15,170
And 2019 40% in high school reported sadness or hopelessness over the last two weeks.

229
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:25,340
I'm sure COVID 19 impacted this as well as it was up from previous years, but still really high percentages and 17% reported suicidal ideation.

230
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:33,740
And something's going on with our our girls there that they're reporting that more likely than males and I believe attacks suicide attempts as well.

231
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:40,420
This was another model by chap manipulator.

232
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:50,200
This was more an ecological framework of youth Latino youth relationships, as do in the context of meeting and touring.

233
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:59,470
And so I just had some good, some some good concepts that kept coming up in the literature, such as My Cultural Lives and acculturation.

234
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:02,920
So by cultural wisdom is thought to be protective.

235
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:08,139
It's just like your comfort in moving in between cultures and still like having a strong,

236
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:13,120
sensitive identity that can protect you from negative mental health outcomes.

237
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:17,889
Acculturation is a barrier like everybody measures it differently.

238
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:26,620
Everybody has different theories about. I mean, I feel like there's not consensus about really its impact on mental health overall.

239
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:33,220
My understanding was that if you're not a it's kind of like a you if you're not acculturated at all,

240
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:40,480
they think it impacts your your mental health because, you know, you can't speak the language, you can't access services.

241
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:47,799
And then the more you become acculturated, you kind of get to this middle point that might be considered like by cultural ism.

242
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,130
You're comfortable with both,

243
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:58,610
but you're still have a strong identity and that protects you from negative mental health outcomes and negative like behaviors.

244
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:05,440
And then as you become more acculturated and become more American than it's detrimental to your health.

245
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:15,490
That's kind of what the overall I think what the overall rationale is behind it and how it works.

246
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:25,030
I think one big thing about acculturation is that it can distract from the structural factors that are playing in here.

247
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:28,570
It's so focused on the individual still.

248
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:40,029
And similarly to the like the Latin X health paradox, where if you're recently emigrated,

249
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:46,100
you're healthier, or if you're Hispanic, you're innately healthier.

250
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:53,650
I think that also kind of distracts away from structural factors and health disparities that do exist among the population.

251
00:29:57,850 --> 00:30:01,210
So I think overall for this model, what was interesting,

252
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:05,350
she had sort of the different reference points like the parents experience versus

253
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:09,610
the youth and how this will still impact everybody's health in the household.

254
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:17,170
Like if your parents really depressed because of what happened, you know, that will definitely impact youth mental health and health as well.

255
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:23,620
She also highlights this discrimination, the social poor and the context of arrival.

256
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:30,670
And then here's some more protective factors that came up quite a bit.

257
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:36,070
Is the sense of cohesion being protective and families in their families more that

258
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:40,930
priorities and family and having an extensive network were protective as well.

259
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:51,819
School school was a huge context that was talked about in terms of being able perhaps areas to

260
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:57,700
intervene with youth because it's the place where they're more like they're going to be racialized,

261
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:09,100
right? Because that's where they're interacting with other other groups and also maybe where trauma might bubble up when they're in that context.

262
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:16,239
So that that was talked about was a key context to maybe to take advantage

263
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:21,850
of to to target some of these issues that can improve mental health in kids.

264
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:29,350
And then there is the list of kind of outcomes that they were looking at among migrant youth immigrant.

265
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,360
So this is just sort of a summary we've already talked about. I think all of this.

266
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:43,440
I guess I guess maybe generational status. That was something I think related to acculturation, right?

267
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:49,860
So if you're if at the risk factor for a whole day of stress when you first get here because you're

268
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:55,680
going through all these changes and then they say perhaps when you're kind of at this happy,

269
00:31:56,580 --> 00:32:04,920
when you've gone through the country to stress, you're also less you're healthier than the population here.

270
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:12,840
It's it's kind of confusing, I think. We don't know a lot about what happens as the generations go and everybody's measuring it differently.

271
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:20,190
So it's kind of hard to know. What else have made you oh man to help them.

272
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:24,160
And Latino families can be a taboo can be seen as a weakness.

273
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:32,220
It can be something that's ignored or minimized. That was something else that came up as a risk factor for working on this neighborhood disorder,

274
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:40,410
where they're the context they're living in, and then huge disparities regardless of documentation status to their access to services.

275
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:47,250
So under insurance or no insurance, just not knowing about the resources that are available.

276
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:52,230
And then almost everybody called out there's really not probably linguistically

277
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:57,510
developed new development or culturally appropriate services for Latin immigrant youth.

278
00:32:57,930 --> 00:33:01,620
This sounds like something pretty specialized that we just don't have yet.

279
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:07,290
Kind of the sense I was getting. And then protective factors.

280
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:16,470
We have our family support systems, parenting responsiveness, ethnic identity, the enclaves and potentially generational status.

281
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:23,220
And then these were a bunch of different outcomes that kind of were coming up through the literature that people were looking at.

282
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:34,670
And they started. I have my scale paper now, like what scales people are using to try to figure out how they're they're measuring these things.

283
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:41,060
So what kind of approaches should we be doing to start to tackle this?

284
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:46,340
The system level approaches are pretty big.

285
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:56,660
So we should be we should have immigration and asylum policies that uphold humanitarian law and that are trauma informed and culturally responsive.

286
00:33:58,130 --> 00:34:08,330
We need a lot of political will, I think, to make anything like that happen, which, yeah, I haven't seen in most of our administrations.

287
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:15,709
And then including immigrants and and publicly funded indigent care was an option in

288
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:19,250
terms of giving them more access to health services and maybe mental health services.

289
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:23,360
I think some states do do that. I just don't think it's required.

290
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:33,649
Also, on the state level, I was thinking of the the economic violence, you know, more maybe at state level,

291
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:41,900
more stricter enforcement of workplace safety, but in a way that wouldn't put undocumented people in in danger.

292
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:44,150
I don't know how that would how that would work.

293
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:52,070
And then little things, at least with our family, like being able to have a license regardless of your status.

294
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:55,879
Things like that seem little, but they do make a big difference.

295
00:34:55,880 --> 00:35:02,750
They give you freedom to go to school, to go to work without worrying about being stopped and having your being deported or something.

296
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:08,270
And it just it reduces your stress when you have when you have freedom.

297
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:17,870
So those might be some other more system level things we could think about, but again, would require a lot of political will, I think.

298
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:27,150
But since I know some states are do do that like give immigrants not even regardless of documentation status licenses.

299
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:31,520
Maybe that's an interesting thing to see. Like how is that what has that changed?

300
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:42,920
And then there are tons of community level approaches. So educating communities that are receiving these youth and figuring out and training

301
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:47,420
them and how to really maximize the strengths that are there and meet their needs,

302
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:49,969
at least in the border.

303
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:57,800
This fell a lot onto our religious community and like all of our churches set up like the shelters because there was just no there was no support.

304
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:04,850
So, yeah, there's also this whole idea of like, where are the resources going to come?

305
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:15,620
But. And then again, considering the school setting to to reach them and all these different aspects of providing them mental health services,

306
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:22,670
social support and providing education to to both the parents and the children and the adolescence on,

307
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:28,190
you know, adolescent mental health, some potential outcomes from trauma,

308
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:37,010
what to expect and their adjustment to the new community and things that foster that ethnic identity development.

309
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:45,260
So that seems to be protective and then helping them integrate into their new community by doing community based activities,

310
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:48,680
having cultural brokers and school settings,

311
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:57,500
maybe that can be available to help that doing events and people can show up there when they're not working, things like that.

312
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:02,989
And then again, Mary talked about how this doesn't really exist, but that's what everybody's saying.

313
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:06,530
Yeah, but I haven't.

314
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:09,260
And maybe that's something to more look into like what,

315
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:16,150
what programs have been tested and might meet some of these criteria like but it was always talked about as sort of a,

316
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:22,100
a need that hasn't been made yet. But even getting access to mental health services was hard.

317
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:26,450
And then once they got it, it probably wasn't meeting all the all the needs.

318
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:37,110
So that's what I've learned so far. Now I can maybe start focusing in on a particular piece of it for.

319
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:47,840
Our next assignment. Yeah, I think.

320
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:58,530
Any questions about anything? I guess when you're saying that, it's like stepping into a piece of.

321
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:07,510
Our way is bringing to see yourself. Yeah, I would.

322
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:11,860
I'm really interested in the school, maybe potential school interventions.

323
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:21,129
I saw some people were using this trauma focused cognitive behavioral therapy piece, which my mentor, Dr. P, is kind of familiar with.

324
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:24,340
So maybe that would be something to start exploring.

325
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:34,180
My frustration with all this was how to do more like system levels and not put so much onus on the community but in on the individual.

326
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:44,080
But yeah, I still haven't. I mean, these are heavy lifts, so I don't know.

327
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,350
But my fear is I don't know.

328
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:54,940
I want in terms of doing multi-level, I guess the only like the only way it could reach a systems level is maybe just, you know, advocating.

329
00:38:54,940 --> 00:39:04,209
And I don't know if you guys have suggestions on how you deal with that when you want to be able to impact more system levels.

330
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:13,850
But. It just yeah, maybe it's just something that you try to do in the background where you're doing other, other work.

331
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:18,940
I think it's cards, especially with this particular subject.

332
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:21,880
Yeah, that's a huge barrier.

333
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:35,220
But yeah, the politicize piece is really that's why if we could get systems that are so criminalizing or like violent against refugees and immigrants,

334
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:39,340
it would be it would make our work easier and it would be to the benefit.

335
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:46,990
I mean, it's like thinking about how bigger or Latinx youth population is if they're have struggling with mental health.

336
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,440
I mean, this is our future workforce, our future parents.

337
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:54,070
You would think there would be more political will, but.

338
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:03,590
So you know I think as more has more.

339
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:11,249
This town. Sweet talk, but. 100,000 out around this specific policy.

340
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:17,400
He's also been listed on Apple. Done by design.

341
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,720
One hopes that they'll be that sort of so.

342
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:29,970
In particular. Yeah. Like. Yeah.

343
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:35,910
The damage that they've been inflicted from that to the biological responses in the House.

344
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:43,099
Yeah. Yeah. I think that even just like. We designed these policies and here's where these kids went.

345
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:48,080
And I think it's important to note it. Some of these data are really hard to find.

346
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:53,860
Yeah, we're. Where they ended up is so scary.

347
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:55,990
Yeah. Yeah. And not.

348
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:08,850
There's just so much around the experience to lose sight of science 5 to 9 policies, as well as these sort of bigger picture issues that are really.

349
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:16,690
Yeah. But no, that's what needs to be done.

350
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:25,670
But yeah. How do you get there? Yeah. And like and also, I mean, I feel like we all have the same kind of struggle, like in our heart,

351
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:30,569
these big picture things that would make a huge impact if there had to be change.

352
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:35,770
And the only way to. Nothing happened as over. Longer timescale.

353
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:42,300
You know, coalition and all these things. But then there's all these like Youth in Crisis today.

354
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:48,540
Right. So one thing, how do you balance violence, you know, like psychological and how can you say work on this?

355
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:52,180
But there's all this other stuff. But if this is a change, this is like for what?

356
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:55,260
Yeah. Yeah. So it is.

357
00:41:55,290 --> 00:41:58,630
And, and I think we had talked about in that pediatric group that's.

358
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:07,820
Yeah. In the space around us determining policies, practices, procedures for when kids come.

359
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:19,460
Yeah to make it more systematic and time there were I remember like Wednesday with the separation the border crisis what you know the family is.

360
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:27,510
There were some people from here had gone there to be observers.

361
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:31,960
Oh, my. I was just jotting down some names.

362
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:35,450
People I remember who did. But Michelle Heisler is one.

363
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:42,310
She does. She's been. She sounds familiar.

364
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:46,930
Yeah, she was in. She's a physician.

365
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:51,820
But I think she was like. He is filling in.

366
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:58,600
Oh, maybe with that she feel like she's probably still holds for you in an appointment that she's in now.

367
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:04,650
A different position. Just very, very focused on this.

368
00:43:05,350 --> 00:43:10,590
People. Okay. Refugee.

369
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:17,739
In her last speech, I. You know her as a lawyer.

370
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:24,000
Okay. Yeah. So she's somebody that might be good to just sort of look up and potentially reach out.

371
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:27,940
She still has the capacity to facilitate it.

372
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:39,100
The school's social worker, Joe Ryan, is another person who I think is aware that she's a social worker, a clinician.

373
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:47,240
It also does like big data stuff. So I'm about like, how do we document this impact?

374
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:51,780
Yeah. Figure out. Is the data really.

375
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:55,380
I think by design, like purposely bad. Yeah.

376
00:43:55,700 --> 00:44:00,950
I don't want to push things under the rug. Yeah, I. So what's going on?

377
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:08,990
Right. Yeah. Yeah. Finding some systems like what he does.

378
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:12,790
It's like looks at these different DNA strands.

379
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:23,120
People in education, frustration that raises all these other things to sort of see where people are coming up, which, again, is hard, but.

380
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:26,410
Yeah, but once people are in here. Right.

381
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:30,710
They're not required anymore. Yeah. So it's like there's.

382
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:34,480
It is an interesting space and I know that he is my personal assistant.

383
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:39,320
Oh, it's tough to take something like an anniversary just to talk about her.

384
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:52,820
I think. Oh, and I think that your point to her just there's so many kids and it's our future workforce.

385
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:57,110
And I think I felt that all the time for talking about child health.

386
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:04,250
General is just sort of saying like, you know, here's the stress process here so that it has health and here's the cost.

387
00:45:04,730 --> 00:45:07,850
You know, what we will all pay is taxpayers, right.

388
00:45:07,850 --> 00:45:12,950
And these are healthy adults with experience, especially early in life stressors.

389
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:21,910
So. Has a big time fight. And so yeah, if that's how they want to be motivated then that they're gonna.

390
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:28,510
Yeah. Yeah. I think it is interesting too is the bigger global picture.

391
00:45:29,410 --> 00:45:34,840
I feel like, you know, just the way that my political podcast listening and stuff, just hearing like,

392
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:43,570
you know, the Latino vote and like there's just a lot of different ways that it plays out.

393
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:48,490
Yeah. You know. Yeah. All over the place by region.

394
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:52,070
Yeah. Immigration in general. I think it's generational status.

395
00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:55,600
Yeah. Mm hmm. Definitely. Yeah. And.

396
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:02,570
Yeah. That is something else that limits their power here, right?

397
00:46:02,570 --> 00:46:05,570
Like, oh, I don't need to appeal to these kids.

398
00:46:05,810 --> 00:46:11,840
They're not constituents of mine. They're not going to be able to vote for me. So why would I invest, like at the state level or community level?

399
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:17,870
Like, why would I invest my political power in this group, you know? That's another.

400
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:29,460
I'm here to protect. Yeah, I go back to.

401
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:31,870
Yeah.

402
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:41,290
I mean, just like looking at that and thinking, wow, you know, those risk factors really seem to outweigh I know this is such a depressing slide.

403
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,750
What other protective factors, you know, or.

404
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:51,870
It did. It did make me wonder, like in a school context.

405
00:46:53,600 --> 00:47:02,970
It could be a place where way more trauma to her brain, especially if they're sort of isolated at high level classes or something.

406
00:47:03,390 --> 00:47:08,660
Yeah, it's very isolated and like they're a special needs group kind of thing.

407
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:17,260
And then I just wondered, like, what are the schools really thinking of school sports facilities?

408
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:23,330
You know, schools are still. Our underfunded is not that.

409
00:47:23,330 --> 00:47:26,899
But yeah. How do we look?

410
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:38,350
Especially if you'd be interested in thinking about for. At times that could have could end up in the protective factor.

411
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:48,940
Yeah, definitely. I thought that at first school they definitely I mean, they're connecting them with other kids.

412
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:55,419
So social support, you know, is something that I'm sure the school is helping with besides their immediate

413
00:47:55,420 --> 00:48:00,700
family and then teaching them the language tools that they can have to have more.

414
00:48:05,030 --> 00:48:15,300
I just. What kind of history was that?

415
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:18,830
Like the insurance that was like. Bottom.

416
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:23,390
A lot of political experience. Was not going to.

417
00:48:25,090 --> 00:48:29,750
Must be. That's a good justification.

418
00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:40,170
Mm hmm. Yeah. And then connecting them to social workers like things they might not have thought about, like resources they didn't know about.

419
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:42,170
I think. Yeah, there's a project.

420
00:48:43,770 --> 00:48:51,000
It is a proposed project for the kind of looking at that sort of like screening for social determinants of health in a school context.

421
00:48:51,330 --> 00:48:54,810
I think this population would be potentially.

422
00:48:55,290 --> 00:49:03,730
What could potentially benefit from that? Yeah. That's going to remove the documentation status considerations of an agency.

423
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:09,050
Right? Right. Mm hmm. And then it's also. That's my old school.

424
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:13,340
I mean, it does kind of put the child in that baby in that life.

425
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:20,210
Caretaking, you know, like finding things out like that.

426
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:29,750
They are. Yeah, they're. They definitely are. And, like, it could be like it could have an impact on someone or something like that, but it could be.

427
00:49:29,990 --> 00:49:35,990
It's probably also a curvilinear relationship. Yeah. Strange that, like, some of it is really empowering.

428
00:49:36,110 --> 00:49:40,460
Yeah. Right. It puts them in the driver's seat, especially their adolescence.

429
00:49:40,550 --> 00:49:46,760
Right. That's a great thing for people to be able to do and lives and the purpose of family.

430
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:51,230
But then also to the detriment of your school.

431
00:49:52,230 --> 00:49:55,370
Mm hmm. Problematic. So. Yeah. Interesting. Like.

432
00:49:57,050 --> 00:50:01,940
Process to think about. Yeah. Yeah. And especially in the context of, you know,

433
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:07,129
what the traditional roles are within the family to kind of changes the almost like the

434
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:11,360
power dynamic a little bit if they're the ones that have the access to the system.

435
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:20,840
Yeah. Yeah. I'm just thinking about how you might treat, you know, school based school staff.

436
00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:25,910
Mhm. You know, maybe try it for CBT.

437
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:32,180
Yeah. No. With respect to this population.

438
00:50:32,390 --> 00:50:36,420
I mean, I really like how you and I are both like, you know.

439
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:40,440
Different stages of the journey.

440
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:44,189
Mm hmm. And it seems like somehow. Yeah.

441
00:50:44,190 --> 00:50:50,850
Just like that's part of the. Taylor that would be really valuable.

442
00:50:56,340 --> 00:51:00,960
Every single one of you on the school staff approach is to treat everybody in the school.

443
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:07,830
Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Right. So that they're aware and can identify maybe when things are bubbling up and.

444
00:51:08,310 --> 00:51:13,530
Yeah. And some strategies to. Just because I do that, do you think?

445
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:18,580
I mean, I think there's a little bit there's not one person.

446
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:24,520
I feel like a million. He's like a. I think he's probably embarrassed.

447
00:51:25,450 --> 00:51:29,990
You know, that kind of mental health that was at UCSF for forever.

448
00:51:30,010 --> 00:51:33,640
And he does a lot in terms of like Latino youth.

449
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:42,390
And I health. But like there probably is.

450
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:46,170
Mm hmm. And so I think it's time for the next generation.

451
00:51:46,590 --> 00:51:50,680
Yeah, but he was really on.

452
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:57,690
A lot of that just sort of that idea of like, you know, adapting no Internet.

453
00:51:58,510 --> 00:52:02,200
You know, linguistically, culturally, all these different levels of I mean.

454
00:52:06,090 --> 00:52:09,129
You years in the nineties.

455
00:52:09,130 --> 00:52:13,880
That would have been when this first wave of people were coming from the Civil War.

456
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:17,830
So it's probably still be relevant. Yeah, it's kind of interesting.

457
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:42,900
I was just writing down my notes and Googling. That's a mental health research program.

458
00:52:46,010 --> 00:52:49,010
He's America's founder, Institute for International.

459
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:55,080
Internet chat. And yet he was at.

460
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:58,900
In 1977. How?

461
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:04,040
So yeah, it is a good. Yeah, everybody.

462
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:12,310
So if you've never read it. In 1961, it was ten.

463
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:36,180
Now on mental health risk for COVID 19. My brother's memory is pinpointed as okay.

464
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:43,080
Oh, yeah, definitely. But yeah, I think. Yeah.

465
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:46,490
Like, he's really. He's really great.

466
00:53:51,790 --> 00:53:54,699
Yeah. I feel like his name did come up in the articles I was reading,

467
00:53:54,700 --> 00:54:00,240
but although we'll take it and focus in on schools, I'm sure it'll come up a lot more too.

468
00:54:00,850 --> 00:54:05,380
Yeah, and I think I will. That was kind of a consensus, I felt like.

469
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:09,560
Yeah. And I mean, if it's youth and then you have like that, that's.

470
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:15,570
And at the heart of that many people the to you right or.

471
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:22,760
Does seem like like just sort of like whenever when I was teaching that mental health course, I.

472
00:54:23,690 --> 00:54:27,829
And I knew his work anyway, probably more than that was a research assistant.

473
00:54:27,830 --> 00:54:35,150
I remember like hearing about him, but I just like delved into some of that work around like cultural tailoring and in particular.

474
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:43,530
But I feel like what we need is a novel now. Was certainly the report that you sent was.

475
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:49,790
Was this like the story of the journey? And I think it's going to happen because of all the crises of the.

476
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:55,120
That was her son. The U.S. was like.

477
00:54:56,900 --> 00:55:01,340
Possibly. Right. Definitely shopping at the mall.

478
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:10,340
Yeah. I feel like that highlight of the journey is maybe, I don't know, feels like a traditional Native American workplace.

479
00:55:10,550 --> 00:55:14,090
Right. And what I have. Oh, that's a very, very.

480
00:55:14,990 --> 00:55:22,720
Just when you spoke about that person's life. I think that is like certainly the counter argument of like, oh.

481
00:55:23,150 --> 00:55:26,260
So much violence is coming here. Oh, yeah.

482
00:55:26,270 --> 00:55:30,350
No violence exploded. Yeah. So, like, making it.

483
00:55:30,490 --> 00:55:34,400
Yeah. Clear and kind of putting it in that story.

484
00:55:35,610 --> 00:55:47,180
They weren't. Would it be a helpful way to put him in a box and to say, you know, to kind of give it up?

485
00:55:48,650 --> 00:55:56,420
I don't know. Like, it was kind of like, yeah, you know, and to kind of counteract and sort of get ahead of some events.

486
00:55:56,900 --> 00:56:00,020
Right. That might say, well, why is it important to us?

487
00:56:00,170 --> 00:56:09,360
And also, like even why is it important to us to. Talk about your journey and that kind of interim intergenerational factors around that.

488
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:17,610
The migration journey. You know, I think that, you know.

489
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:23,070
Intergenerational patterns of health, family law versus history.

490
00:56:23,250 --> 00:56:28,890
All of that stuff really matters. But this is. They're important matters.

491
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:35,180
Feels like it could be that. Welcome back to the.

492
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:41,950
Yeah. Topic, it's definitely. So in the news cycle.

493
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:53,160
Yeah. So intergenerational, just like that migration started impacting your kids.

494
00:56:53,330 --> 00:56:58,049
Have they been here? Yeah, it has been a generational trauma.

495
00:56:58,050 --> 00:57:02,490
They talk about that a lot with native populations, but it definitely applies here.

496
00:57:03,390 --> 00:57:11,140
And I think, I mean, not to make it sort of like white flip or whatever, but I feel like, okay, now we've got all these therapists.

497
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:16,090
Yeah. Like finally this way to reach my clients.

498
00:57:16,110 --> 00:57:19,440
Yeah. And it was like about that.

499
00:57:19,470 --> 00:57:23,880
Yeah. It was a very like, don't talk about Bruno.

500
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:30,740
I should have to see that movie. You could put up like Bruno and just say that.

501
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:38,430
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just because it didn't it did speak a lot to that and to the violent at the beginning.

502
00:57:38,430 --> 00:57:42,120
It, it was that was yeah, it was a hot topic in Colombia.

503
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:45,209
I watched them like like that. Yeah.

504
00:57:45,210 --> 00:57:52,260
And just, you know, like the, the people I talked to and then like, you know, the Twitter sphere around like mental health.

505
00:57:52,350 --> 00:58:03,300
Yeah. Therapists and, you know, it's been a really powerful thing to do that like sometimes movies can just go together like the other one about like.

506
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:10,830
To about. It's my little girl.

507
00:58:10,890 --> 00:58:15,800
Yeah. I.

508
00:58:17,730 --> 00:58:24,130
Yeah. What is that? It's not it's not like that.

509
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:31,190
Nice. And making a second getaway inside out.

510
00:58:31,830 --> 00:58:34,950
And he's out with the emotion at 24 hours.

511
00:58:35,130 --> 00:58:38,220
Yeah. Oh, that'd be good. Yeah.

512
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:46,050
Because it was like that was also like very fast. Like, I think like two of the three based on a lot of the stuff you just talked about.

513
00:58:47,110 --> 00:58:50,730
And that was like based on, like, notions neuroscience.

514
00:58:50,790 --> 00:58:57,450
Yeah. You know, that were like, oh, my gosh, they're really referencing the science findings that they're making.

515
00:58:57,470 --> 00:59:00,990
It's relatively relevant. I'm sorry to that. Yeah.

516
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:04,110
Yeah. Yeah. So, like, just thinking of ways to like.

517
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:08,800
To send him back a little. Yeah.

518
00:59:11,620 --> 00:59:16,950
It's frustrating. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I have no idea.

519
00:59:20,490 --> 00:59:24,830
Just thinking about it, thinking about this whole piece that you seem to be able to make it sort of.

520
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:31,420
Last week after reading some. Project. I would like to speak.

521
00:59:33,510 --> 00:59:36,710
They have both experienced her registering into their household.

522
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:43,890
Right instructions for parents. I feel like that, actually.

523
00:59:43,970 --> 00:59:47,580
I don't know if this is actually. Yeah.

524
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:52,420
As well given all the common factors that could be barriers to that.

525
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:58,450
But. You take some of the pressure off?

526
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:05,840
Adolescents are being responsible for. Yeah.

527
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:11,790
They think that that was referenced in the literature too, like as a space to give education not to just the kids,

528
01:00:11,790 --> 01:00:16,590
but also to the parents and maybe treat maybe help them access treatment, too.

529
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:23,969
And it's just a matter of, you know, making it accessible based on like work and stuff,

530
01:00:23,970 --> 01:00:29,730
like just being more conscious of the population there they might be able to.

531
01:00:29,850 --> 01:00:36,090
And then yeah, that creating the community events and things that can make parents feel more involved.

532
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:44,069
That's another thing that I've always been thinking about is like how to help immigrant parents.

533
01:00:44,070 --> 01:00:52,630
Also just understand the education system here. Yeah, because my my sister in law, it's funny, she's 17.

534
01:00:52,660 --> 01:00:57,090
She's my sister in law. She's going through college application process now.

535
01:00:57,090 --> 01:01:02,040
So we've been helping her with that because like my my mother in law knows nothing about it.

536
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:06,749
She's been here for like 15 years, but never had the opportunity to learn the language or anything.

537
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:10,110
She's been talking about unclothed uncle. That's been her experience.

538
01:01:10,110 --> 01:01:15,900
So. But then, like the kind of parents programing they have is never when she can go.

539
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:23,080
She works six days of the seven and so I've always thought about that a lot to say well what can we do?

540
01:01:23,310 --> 01:01:26,700
I think too. And you know, I'm not sure a.

541
01:01:27,610 --> 01:01:33,640
Yeah. But just people's transparency with education systems.

542
01:01:33,970 --> 01:01:37,600
Like, maybe, like school, like this incredibly early. Oh, yeah, she did.

543
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:46,870
Yeah. Mm hmm. And I feel like having that kind of, like, fits with the idea of trying to get schools to be more.

544
01:01:47,580 --> 01:01:52,200
Used by the community other than school, right.

545
01:01:53,330 --> 01:01:57,200
Evening hours are going to get worse. Yeah, but then also eating out.

546
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,480
Community is saying, hey, look, we don't have to.

547
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:07,640
Talk about that. Right. And then be.

548
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:13,720
Trying to figure out something, actually. Anything is not.

549
01:02:19,820 --> 01:02:25,910
Right? Exactly. So much. Mm hmm.

550
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:29,870
But I think that the fact is there's a trusted and always. Right.

551
01:02:29,990 --> 01:02:34,160
Trusted broker in the school that could. Yeah. Be doing a lot more.

552
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:38,790
Yeah, I never meant to. Mm hmm. A lot of people just.

553
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:44,950
School hours. Yeah. Yeah. Forgiving them, maybe.

554
01:02:45,580 --> 01:02:46,070
Yeah.

555
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:53,620
And think something not just with their kids, but maybe things that they would like to work on for themselves, like to read or, you know, whatever.

556
01:02:53,950 --> 01:02:57,380
English. Yeah. Yeah.

557
01:02:57,630 --> 01:03:03,210
I just paid for that. Like, of basically like in schools, you know, like schools with these big buildings.

558
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:08,270
70 for so many hours as an party in the summer mean there's ways to.

559
01:03:09,410 --> 01:03:12,500
Utilize them as places that are community.

560
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:19,830
The whole time in the activities. Yeah. There's like a catchphrase there is.

561
01:03:19,890 --> 01:03:24,120
Okay, but it doesn't make it more community center.

562
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:27,180
Like the community responded more than 15%, which.

563
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:33,560
It's so logical and it's.

564
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:41,920
Right. It's not standardized in any way. And then when you think about that importance of like families will connection.

565
01:03:42,380 --> 01:03:46,210
Student achievement. Yep. At all. Solving courses.

566
01:03:46,940 --> 01:03:50,370
Self. Yeah, that's.

567
01:03:53,970 --> 01:04:03,670
And it would be interesting. I know we talked about. Amparo Montano.

568
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:10,390
John Faith was working. Schools and communities.

569
01:04:11,820 --> 01:04:15,580
Yeah. Yes, at that. She's like.

570
01:04:17,230 --> 01:04:20,350
In some sort of personal perspective of photography sort of makes.

571
01:04:22,220 --> 01:04:30,200
I mean, with families working. I don't see dads in the same place for at least a couple in a very different context.

572
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:36,480
30. But the rules could be sort of a safe place for families to come.

573
01:04:36,630 --> 01:04:41,100
Yeah, but I think sort of like maybe like a pediatric office.

574
01:04:41,550 --> 01:04:44,560
Yeah. That's more mandated to prepare for.

575
01:04:45,060 --> 01:04:55,810
Mm hmm. It's just interesting that. Yeah.

576
01:04:55,810 --> 01:05:04,760
And I think just in my previous work with Latino culture, it's like if you talk about their kids, they show up, you know, no matter what.

577
01:05:05,380 --> 01:05:15,490
It's also has that kind of a cultural benefit, I think, to if it's kid centered, it's it's kind of a hook for them too.

578
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:22,959
We used it to talk about like, um, cancer prevention stuff mean like it was talking about their family and their

579
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:26,080
kids was that the schools were also kind of an avenue to do some of that,

580
01:05:27,370 --> 01:05:36,460
you know, where did you end up meeting with people about how to do that in terms of where people could come and participate in research?

581
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:41,510
An your project. Yeah. So we did.

582
01:05:42,140 --> 01:05:48,860
And my for education stuff, it was it was easier for researchers, a lot harder to get them involved.

583
01:05:49,250 --> 01:05:54,920
And what ended up being the best method was having a provider share the research with them.

584
01:05:56,180 --> 01:05:59,420
That was our biggest avenue for enrollment.

585
01:05:59,620 --> 01:06:11,720
Yeah. Because it was a it was for Latina moms with cancer and they were already kind of so overburdened with cancer, like all the other family stuff.

586
01:06:13,580 --> 01:06:18,630
That and also a real mistrust of what research is and you know, for.

587
01:06:19,250 --> 01:06:23,870
Yeah. So for us ended up being provider recommendation.

588
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:32,930
We did lots of community events at community centers and schools, sending things home and backpacks and that kind of thing.

589
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:42,170
But pretty low. Some response, but pretty low response to like an enrollment.

590
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:55,620
Who wants to do? Well, gentlemen, it's been a great pleasure.

591
01:06:57,290 --> 01:07:05,740
And I guess one thing just sort of thinking about the questions that you guys might have for a panel, like about.

592
01:07:16,170 --> 01:07:28,290
Look at that. Uh. These were things that kind of came up for panel.

593
01:07:28,300 --> 01:07:35,620
Maybe I can also just leave this up to see if that's helpful for us in chatting with them.

594
01:07:35,620 --> 01:07:41,800
But if we have questions for them. These were others that might be that might be helpful.

595
01:07:43,030 --> 01:07:48,920
And this. Oh, this site.

596
01:07:48,930 --> 01:07:56,250
This is the one that I keep I've mentioned before. But this is the site that I think you guys should have access to on campus now.

597
01:07:56,270 --> 01:08:00,480
Okay, good. Okay.

598
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:05,450
So cool. I sort of feel that Keanu.

599
01:08:06,870 --> 01:08:12,120
So hopefully they can they'll show up in a few. The restaurant.

600
01:08:19,530 --> 01:08:37,720
Yeah. Yeah.

601
01:08:42,450 --> 01:08:48,520
You? I think.

602
01:08:57,730 --> 01:09:02,300
Something about telling her that I.

603
01:09:23,130 --> 01:09:47,620
The late. We have something on.

604
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:39,420
You. That's the bottom line, is that.

605
01:10:41,980 --> 01:10:45,430
Yeah, I to. Yeah.

606
01:10:47,020 --> 01:10:56,830
Yeah. I want to say.

607
01:11:06,690 --> 01:11:17,670
Yeah. You want us to?

608
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:29,040
Even after. Thank you.

609
01:11:29,070 --> 01:11:32,700
Hi. Hi. Hello.

610
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:37,710
Did you like for the front among the.

611
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:49,280
Here. I'm here in the basement.

612
01:11:49,790 --> 01:11:54,470
In my basement stuff. Looking back a bit.

613
01:11:56,520 --> 01:12:00,290
Yeah, we. It was something.

614
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:06,770
Yeah, yeah, yeah. We have.

615
01:12:09,110 --> 01:12:17,240
And I really talk about sort of. I mean, I was like, Yeah, do you see that?

616
01:12:17,930 --> 01:12:21,560
You know, I heard.

617
01:12:23,380 --> 01:12:29,790
Yeah. Yeah, but I grew here that I wasn't.

618
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:51,580
I thought I was on the phone trying to do a connection.

619
01:12:55,280 --> 01:13:03,480
So. But get these little red not.

620
01:13:06,550 --> 01:13:15,220
Yeah. Right. Yeah. I know. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.

621
01:13:15,340 --> 01:13:28,920
Oh, great movie. I got everything I wasn't meant to have, but I guess somebody be in Germany.

622
01:13:32,350 --> 01:13:38,090
Her name right now, I.

623
01:13:38,540 --> 01:13:44,059
I don't think. I never know.

624
01:13:44,060 --> 01:13:55,180
And I really start my email with like, I have to have something that I was like, Oh my God, I don't really know.

625
01:13:55,710 --> 01:14:00,500
It's like, Oh, yeah, it's not yet.

626
01:14:01,380 --> 01:14:11,680
Oh, I. But I think it's okay that I didn't.

627
01:14:12,090 --> 01:14:15,670
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

628
01:14:15,950 --> 01:14:19,220
I want to make sure it's awesome. I'm gonna go back and read.

629
01:14:19,270 --> 01:14:23,930
Like, it's not that I haven't read.

630
01:14:27,790 --> 01:14:34,780
Yeah. Yeah. Good. Yeah, I like it.

631
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:38,570
I'll play around with this and work it out with them and play around with it.

632
01:14:41,370 --> 01:14:44,880
Yeah. And that was. I was. I didn't know.

633
01:14:46,150 --> 01:14:53,290
Yeah. There's nothing. Nothing. I know that sounds anything.

634
01:14:53,290 --> 01:15:03,159
I'll tell you another way that we know right now.

635
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:06,440
It was like a large restaurant.

636
01:15:07,390 --> 01:15:14,690
Did you have. Okay.

637
01:15:17,530 --> 01:15:21,630
And there you go. Yeah.

638
01:15:24,190 --> 01:15:30,500
Yeah. But you didn't really have.

639
01:15:34,910 --> 01:15:42,330
That's going to be her train for another. Oh, this is serious.

640
01:15:43,470 --> 01:15:53,480
No, no. If you have a question, I feel like I just kind of stand by certain things out of that.

641
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:58,950
So, yeah, no, I can't because I said, Oh, I'm sorry.

642
01:16:03,350 --> 01:16:10,500
And I suspect that your daughter.

643
01:16:11,430 --> 01:16:14,720
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, everything like that.

644
01:16:14,740 --> 01:16:27,930
I've not very her. I really do think that that letter has now been made and turned out not to be accurate.

645
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:36,890
I think that when he calls, I think that the think that and then I do think that I know and I respect that.

646
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:41,590
Yeah. Yeah, I know. But. Oh, I think.

647
01:16:41,830 --> 01:16:45,250
I think you can do this.

648
01:16:45,820 --> 01:16:49,660
But I'm tired.

649
01:16:49,750 --> 01:16:54,510
It's for your mental health. Oh, good.

650
01:16:54,520 --> 01:17:00,520
Well, I'm glad. Yeah, I was like, I can't believe I did that. I work for the family.

651
01:17:02,260 --> 01:17:06,600
Thank you guys for coming in. Yeah.

652
01:17:07,060 --> 01:17:13,420
Yeah, I just wanted to. I think it's I know that you guys were trying to build in more opportunities for a pretty interactive stuff.

653
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:17,590
I mean, I feel like you're supposed to have, you know.

654
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:30,130
Question and maybe to go around and do a little mini intro and you know yourself what you're you from the national interest.

655
01:17:30,700 --> 01:17:38,319
And I think it's just helpful to kind of I just put these up here and so I'm kind of like these are just sort of brainstorming

656
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:44,320
that I remember for people discussing the prior times and I like there's always new information that comes to light.

657
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:50,860
So he's just nice guy I like. They found us.

658
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:55,570
And so, yeah, and I don't know if all of you guys know it either, but we can just go out and travel.

659
01:18:04,100 --> 01:18:09,679
Hi. Everyone close? That person that become infected only.

660
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:17,220
And the. In my fifth and hopefully final year here.

661
01:18:17,250 --> 01:18:20,940
I'm in the program and so gradually my research focuses.

662
01:18:24,090 --> 01:18:27,690
It is a bed for my children and they will be out of school.

663
01:18:29,750 --> 01:18:35,660
Results of the summit I'm focused on that are basically. I was looking at how this very.

664
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:41,890
They're standing by right here in Los.

665
01:18:44,050 --> 01:18:47,260
Quite a few of his animated films have.

666
01:18:48,310 --> 01:18:55,400
The Barbie dolls overlap with on the inside. And.

667
01:18:55,460 --> 01:19:08,620
Right. And. And you suggested like maybe your revise your research interests broadly as a practical matter.

668
01:19:10,790 --> 01:19:19,349
Yeah. Anything else? Mean. Mean. I particularly like to know about the man who loved my father.

669
01:19:19,350 --> 01:19:30,460
And that's good enough that my research interests are around reason and expressing concern that I have in fact healthy days,

670
01:19:30,510 --> 01:19:34,870
particularly around the black community. I know.

671
01:19:39,030 --> 01:19:51,540
That. The feeling that. And.

672
01:19:53,910 --> 01:20:10,530
Just everything they need to know that they're behind me as well.

673
01:20:11,730 --> 01:20:21,660
My advice is not anything. I think most people know this ability this year, and my primary research interests include just drag races.

674
01:20:21,660 --> 01:20:25,250
And more specifically, I really interested in how racism and.

675
01:20:26,010 --> 01:20:30,590
Kids and emerging adults in how to better.

676
01:20:33,210 --> 01:20:38,580
And, um. See? Yeah, I think that.

677
01:20:41,220 --> 01:20:45,180
Yeah. And everyone I know, everyone I moron.

678
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:50,310
I'm a third year and I think I work because that's my first communication and

679
01:20:50,970 --> 01:20:58,680
thinking specifically right now and focusing on life expectancy as a decision maker.

680
01:21:00,340 --> 01:21:09,630
So nothing to interesting. Very pleasant for a somewhat man person.

681
01:21:13,480 --> 01:21:19,400
That's true. We're going to meet in person for the first time in Seattle at a conference in June.

682
01:21:21,870 --> 01:21:29,560
Yeah, I do not. Yeah. We do have a lot of the fun.

683
01:21:29,660 --> 01:21:33,340
Yeah. Yeah, that's me.

684
01:21:36,460 --> 01:21:41,240
Hello. I'm Amy, I. I'm the first year, I think probably my interest in my.

685
01:21:42,380 --> 01:21:50,790
That's all for now. Recently I've been really focused especially on community college things that I.

686
01:21:52,630 --> 01:21:56,710
Public health equity. But some health care provision.

687
01:22:02,070 --> 01:22:09,560
I suggested exercise together. So it's fair deny.

688
01:22:14,030 --> 01:22:20,320
The best decisions you feel like you've made on this program so far, either for selection or outside experiences.

689
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:48,710
And you know I that. So yeah I also one.

690
01:22:56,630 --> 01:23:14,180
So new. In my first year and I knew I had to serve.

691
01:23:19,970 --> 01:23:26,260
And my manager is Dr. Patience. And I held her for five inches.

692
01:23:26,260 --> 01:23:37,900
About five. It was Christian kind of, I think a lot of it.

693
01:23:38,590 --> 01:23:43,620
Also, on the flipside, were there things that you wished you would have known about life before?

694
01:23:49,930 --> 01:23:53,900
I'll just say one thing, but it's like you guys are saying it first during the second.

695
01:23:57,060 --> 01:24:02,280
We're in their third year, I'm pretty sure, Laura said.

696
01:24:03,660 --> 01:24:08,430
Yeah. And I was like, I need. Whatever the perspective to entertain.

697
01:24:08,430 --> 01:24:16,080
Like that's very much on the radar and that the fact that you're still working with your coursework.

698
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:24,560
Such as that like situation where. I think I like to do this, too, because it's just sort of like.

699
01:24:26,110 --> 01:24:30,220
You know, checking in with how long it's going to take.

700
01:24:31,550 --> 01:24:36,010
Seems like I giving a lot of lessons as it goes on.

701
01:24:36,040 --> 01:24:51,910
So. Does anybody like that he was questioned about?

702
01:24:53,560 --> 01:25:11,330
What's his word? Well, like. You know, it's weird.

703
01:25:11,670 --> 01:25:14,790
I think my guys will what helped me with the training.

704
01:25:15,060 --> 01:25:21,300
Into that. I was here working for the program, so that helps a lot.

705
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:28,740
Then also he continued to keep maintaining relationships that I felt I was working.

706
01:25:31,450 --> 01:25:35,250
Years because I had a lot of sort of intuition.

707
01:25:35,470 --> 01:25:42,550
Police and military relationships prior to certain person not I've able to maintain them was helpful because none of them are even.

708
01:25:45,110 --> 01:25:48,410
So it's helpful, helpful to kind of have that casual conversation.

709
01:25:49,370 --> 01:25:57,190
Feel like you're. Talking to a faculty member who is here in the department and kind of in all the moments that they want,

710
01:25:57,480 --> 01:26:01,430
not only the other students, I mean, that that has been helpful to kind of how does.

711
01:26:02,710 --> 01:26:13,330
It's not that can we talk to think about it doesn't recommend whether it's people that you already have connections with or people that want to know.

712
01:26:14,220 --> 01:26:23,190
I think that's important to realize that there's a lot of things to have those midterm midterm relationships outside of the U.S. as well,

713
01:26:23,490 --> 01:26:30,230
and that they concern a lot of different. Really vote for me.

714
01:26:31,510 --> 01:26:34,780
You know, in your first year, you're paralyzed by too much choice.

715
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:42,730
Our father. We were never really I mean your papers is everything talks about.

716
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:48,180
But I think something that really worked really well for me that my mentor encouraged me

717
01:26:48,180 --> 01:26:54,060
to do it in my first year was to figure out what are the questions I am interested in?

718
01:26:54,570 --> 01:26:59,900
Are these questions that we answer? Or are they questions that I have to answer?

719
01:27:01,790 --> 01:27:07,250
And I really recommend interviewing that question as early as possible because.

720
01:27:09,100 --> 01:27:15,229
At this point. You like that person that answer that question really and has guided my entire participation

721
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:24,010
in the program and I utilize 100 hours to do an interview to get a paper published.

722
01:27:24,550 --> 01:27:29,860
I spend my first summer collecting primary data, working on a paper, her diet,

723
01:27:30,280 --> 01:27:34,810
and that really informed what I did her and I feel like it really is confirming what I'm doing.

724
01:27:35,020 --> 01:27:42,370
Dissertation But knowing ahead of time, knowing very early that I wanted to be heard and actually answering questions has really

725
01:27:42,370 --> 01:27:47,949
done a really well positioned to tackle that as a challenge in the dissertation phase.

726
01:27:47,950 --> 01:27:52,560
And I think I really. Sometimes the department can.

727
01:27:53,790 --> 01:28:03,270
Advise against doing a part of the collection. And I know I don't really understand that, but I think part of it is a logistical issue.

728
01:28:03,750 --> 01:28:07,620
So if you I would advise you that any contract,

729
01:28:08,820 --> 01:28:15,660
the best way to approach that is by having them and knowing knowing that your questions need to be answered.

730
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:27,820
So. Not his. Or did you get funding to do that without being part of that process?

731
01:28:30,440 --> 01:28:36,349
And actually I didn't have any funding for I interviewed clinicians.

732
01:28:36,350 --> 01:28:40,880
And so I really leverage some of his personal connections so I can pitch my study.

733
01:28:42,610 --> 01:28:47,230
We're raffling up to $100 gift cards and Ryan's covering that very low cost.

734
01:28:47,590 --> 01:28:55,090
But now we have this entire data set, both we can use as one very low cost, but really, you know,

735
01:28:55,360 --> 01:29:00,159
really learn how to write what can be done in a little context and what kind of connections can help facilitate.

736
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:05,980
That was really important. My disappointment.

737
01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:16,360
Yeah, but not for that. I am not personally. Living up to this point and getting to know people.

738
01:29:16,370 --> 01:29:20,050
Definitely. I feel like it helps when I got to know Justin that he's a.

739
01:29:21,790 --> 01:29:30,380
Other collaborators like that. I am not asking for something that's like writing letters.

740
01:29:32,180 --> 01:29:40,280
I learned so much in class and learned how to code, but then like learned so much from I can just be like a collaborator on paper,

741
01:29:40,280 --> 01:29:45,319
whether that's in writing the intro or just writing the analysis or helping

742
01:29:45,320 --> 01:29:49,040
with the discussion and those things that I had to do from start to finish.

743
01:29:49,710 --> 01:29:55,380
Right. Other collaborators. They had been due to let him move things forward a little bit.

744
01:29:56,490 --> 01:30:01,350
And so, yeah, I think that has helped me to come out and do a step by step.

745
01:30:03,630 --> 01:30:15,180
Now I feel comfortable writing my paper and my personal start to finish, but I also like working with other students and master's students.

746
01:30:16,280 --> 01:30:21,770
Charlie just feels a little bit more like a manager, but also a really great.

747
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:26,670
Actually high level learning in I think that.

748
01:30:27,210 --> 01:30:34,930
Right there. I definitely agree with that.

749
01:30:35,160 --> 01:30:43,360
I think with that, I would not have the the. All my research is.

750
01:30:44,110 --> 01:30:52,540
The but students who are who are not being are not being represented and also those who are not in an apartment building network outside.

751
01:30:53,020 --> 01:30:58,010
It makes an awful lot. He was like my mind said, like, I really.

752
01:30:59,090 --> 01:31:06,150
From things like this that coming from work and practicing to like research it is a totally.

753
01:31:07,710 --> 01:31:13,080
It is not who I am, but I think for me, I just have to keep reminding myself.

754
01:31:14,070 --> 01:31:21,380
I'm learning. So I failed and I'm still doing enough going on that now.

755
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:27,500
It had nothing to do with taking. Home is where I would be willing to stay.

756
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:35,330
I'm here to learn. I'm not practicing anymore. I still think that.

757
01:31:38,250 --> 01:31:42,210
Me because the work is so. I mean, you're here like people thought.

758
01:31:43,940 --> 01:31:47,870
You want to get that done? It's just is that is that I think.

759
01:31:48,760 --> 01:31:54,670
The other self doubt. Compare that. Saying her.

760
01:32:07,060 --> 01:32:09,630
I know that some people have done like in outside.

761
01:32:10,780 --> 01:32:19,450
Or think about the fact that these different areas that you'd like to connect with outside of not only outside the city, but even outside.

762
01:32:20,710 --> 01:32:24,760
And that I know know different. Now.

763
01:32:24,780 --> 01:32:30,580
It's not either in terms of workshops, just as we're talking about, if you take out a few workshops like the.

764
01:32:34,410 --> 01:32:39,720
Boxer's adjustments along the lines like what you were seeking early on to help me.

765
01:32:43,110 --> 01:32:50,220
My company is information visualization because I wanted to use that with my build myself.

766
01:32:50,850 --> 01:32:57,690
So I took an eye exam opportunity to take the graphic design classes for the information,

767
01:32:58,170 --> 01:33:05,010
which was architecture class useful information and a data visualization class in the school so far.

768
01:33:05,610 --> 01:33:14,589
And I really encourage that, that path for anyone, not simply to kind of brush up on a scale or something,

769
01:33:14,590 --> 01:33:21,870
but you kind of know how to do more to learn more. I think that I don't know that many other people have taken classes.

770
01:33:21,870 --> 01:33:24,150
And so the question is, I recommend it.

771
01:33:24,210 --> 01:33:32,850
I mean, I think getting outside of the stage and getting into some, you know, different ways and it has been really helpful for me,

772
01:33:33,210 --> 01:33:38,700
not only in skills based, but to bring some innovative perspectives to work.

773
01:33:40,110 --> 01:33:45,780
So I don't believe that we choose the wrong copy, which is also something I think it's helpful to hear.

774
01:33:46,950 --> 01:33:53,280
But it's like whatever, whatever you're feeling, you want to supplement into this public health education.

775
01:33:53,820 --> 01:33:57,060
And I think this will work best for you.

776
01:33:57,120 --> 01:34:02,330
But I think definitely choosing the skills based on having great self as an idea.

777
01:34:07,910 --> 01:34:11,550
I can name one of the opposite.

778
01:34:11,710 --> 01:34:17,260
So I told the psychologist what I did in general,

779
01:34:17,260 --> 01:34:23,110
but I think I'm going to change the name of it because all of the person that I'm taking in psychology or.

780
01:34:26,380 --> 01:34:32,690
And so it's more knowledge based is more valid learning and information about how kids develop.

781
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:42,799
And I'm glad he did because we helped with like 30 knowledge as far as like building

782
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:48,140
like a course in a future that I can go to and I can pull from four different papers.

783
01:34:48,890 --> 01:34:52,400
So that has been helpful on just my knowledge base.

784
01:34:52,460 --> 01:34:59,720
Of course, I like to know the faculty members over and over in psychology and then also in social work.

785
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:06,740
I took a class in my first semester and the school of Social Work that is really different.

786
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:15,869
Of course, it's probably not where you come for anything else. And so, yeah, I definitely think that all schools are important.

787
01:35:15,870 --> 01:35:18,160
And if you're going to go a different route,

788
01:35:18,180 --> 01:35:24,930
make sure that the topic area is really useful for your research and that the professor is going to help like kind

789
01:35:24,930 --> 01:35:32,520
of round out your literature as far as like for different like reviews or like reporting and things like that.

790
01:35:34,890 --> 01:35:42,240
This month, I'm taking two classes at the same time. It really went really well because a lot of the same topics kind of in a couple of them.

791
01:35:42,870 --> 01:35:46,990
And so that has been helpful workflow wise.

792
01:35:48,240 --> 01:35:53,700
And so so if you're going to take to kind of save time, especially if they're super related that.

793
01:35:58,110 --> 01:36:06,250
Is the second person who has that experience. Yeah, I'm taking you taking cognitive development just in the moment.

794
01:36:06,670 --> 01:36:10,140
And then I'm thinking it's actually in the school of social work.

795
01:36:10,190 --> 01:36:21,210
She's a psychologist. What I'm thinking I was actually I think we like development over the span, and this is for kids and adolescents.

796
01:36:21,220 --> 01:36:28,030
So we were following up the last week in college together. And that was her name across.

797
01:36:28,720 --> 01:36:35,230
Oh, yeah. Oh, I know. She's great, cause she does a lot of work related to, like, virtual socialization and stuff as well.

798
01:36:35,230 --> 01:36:39,040
So we're kind of like that in which I wrote, I did a review to free online.

799
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:44,610
Not so. So yeah, it really overlaps a lot with like some of the work that I'm doing predominantly.

800
01:36:44,890 --> 01:36:49,690
So my own work as well, kind of like developing what kind of questions I want to have though.

801
01:36:51,480 --> 01:37:01,129
I don't know the third possibility. But did you? Remember the camera that I've been used to have in technology.

802
01:37:01,130 --> 01:37:08,870
They used to have it separate where there was the entire development, and then there was a an adolescent and early adopter development course.

803
01:37:08,870 --> 01:37:12,570
But this was different from that, of course, and we're moving way too fast.

804
01:37:12,610 --> 01:37:18,490
I think they should have been helpful for us to seven years.

805
01:37:20,340 --> 01:37:24,420
And then I think Fernandez finished her experience this training.

806
01:37:24,650 --> 01:37:27,780
I think so. Somewhat recently. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

807
01:37:28,390 --> 01:37:31,660
Okay. So 3 minutes. I know. Yeah.

808
01:37:32,830 --> 01:37:38,170
What about other people? Yeah. So my company is more so kind of than me.

809
01:37:38,200 --> 01:37:43,480
I am. I started out urban planning, and then after the policy question, I would probably be so happy that.

810
01:37:44,660 --> 01:37:48,100
So that's how I got me. So that made you so confident.

811
01:37:48,110 --> 01:37:56,400
But as far as skills as. In the end of the analysis with the center, because even if we don't use them again.

812
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:09,710
Like Justin Bieber had declared. Second I have to believe that that and an essential work being active both high level and to.

813
01:38:11,060 --> 01:38:16,030
Next year. I'm not using out. I got my dissertation.

814
01:38:16,240 --> 01:38:24,180
But it's good to know that. Or an ad like the basic scale, for example.

815
01:38:24,630 --> 01:38:29,130
I'm going to private now without saying I would look at the analysis and I dancing in the.

816
01:38:32,020 --> 01:38:35,950
So I would say sorry. We're in a very little bit of light by taking.

817
01:38:36,820 --> 01:38:40,390
As his is even. These buildings have that.

818
01:38:47,870 --> 01:39:04,340
So I think you can get back to the 99 cent. I mean, I would recommend.

819
01:39:05,540 --> 01:39:08,590
There are certain projects out there, too, like there's the financing.

820
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:16,250
Certificate said if you're already taking a lot of. So I.

821
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:20,040
Yeah, I think. I think that you.

822
01:39:21,780 --> 01:39:26,480
Absolutely not going into academia to and so it just kind of isn't.

823
01:39:28,120 --> 01:39:32,630
I think along with the economy, it overlaps.

824
01:39:34,890 --> 01:39:43,580
Yeah, I remember. Like I. My comment was like so I wish I could keep it the in health.

825
01:39:46,170 --> 01:39:49,500
I want to get back to their ride. But then over time.

826
01:39:59,050 --> 01:40:07,420
Like I take the cleaning workshop to this day and then another to the c r lc as I write.

827
01:40:09,100 --> 01:40:12,900
And a lot of the voters in it suggest that it is actually.

828
01:40:14,370 --> 01:40:17,730
You take a lot of seminars and you might develop a new teaching field.

829
01:40:17,740 --> 01:40:21,220
And I it really is not.

830
01:40:24,120 --> 01:40:35,970
Yeah. His four. If they are out of their senses and learn to dance.

831
01:40:35,990 --> 01:40:39,430
Learn handshakes and have a.

832
01:40:40,550 --> 01:40:45,080
And rightfully so it and he says it's really.

833
01:40:48,010 --> 01:40:53,590
1969 customer. It's like for us to think it's not really necessary.

834
01:40:54,610 --> 01:41:01,640
Maybe not that. So it's really if you learn a lot of the seminars.

835
01:41:07,020 --> 01:41:12,070
Thanks. Yeah. Yeah, it's great.

836
01:41:13,770 --> 01:41:17,300
It's one of the things like, I don't know you're doing and I didn't know that thing.

837
01:41:17,340 --> 01:41:19,260
At a certain point, that's when I freaked.

838
01:41:21,060 --> 01:41:28,020
And I think comes into play in academia, but also like on your CV, whatever marketing, you know, whatever direction.

839
01:41:28,980 --> 01:41:40,290
And to do that, I like these things because that's an indication of the fact that my organization the business that uses diverse.

840
01:41:41,660 --> 01:41:47,300
So I think that's a great thing to kind of that it's not an academic to.

841
01:41:50,170 --> 01:41:57,910
And and some of these workshops do help us. Sometimes when you play it, did you get funding from.

842
01:42:01,310 --> 01:42:06,460
So that was nice. Gosh, I know that was a defining moment.

843
01:42:06,640 --> 01:42:11,070
I wonder how often you see a lot of like and to know.

844
01:42:12,120 --> 01:42:19,730
Yeah so the C.R.A. meeting and all of those are the like for their like so I started doing Colgate a pretty much everything in virtually.

845
01:42:20,250 --> 01:42:27,990
That's why. A couple of years ago. Right. So that's why maybe I don't know how or so because when I.

846
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:32,960
But anyway, I got funding to participate in.

847
01:42:34,410 --> 01:42:41,770
Eisenhower had a summer program that a lot of people read about the dynamics of the world.

848
01:42:42,760 --> 01:42:47,350
Something happened, and you have plenty. Looking at.

849
01:42:49,700 --> 01:42:52,870
Racial. In science.

850
01:42:53,250 --> 01:42:57,540
I thought that's what I'd do to get better. So whatever your age is now, I forget, I.

851
01:42:57,810 --> 01:43:03,200
And. So the department funded this. These are know the I.

852
01:43:04,590 --> 01:43:10,790
They funded the Assads. In the name of its data.

853
01:43:11,060 --> 01:43:14,400
I think it is a bad idea to get into.

854
01:43:17,140 --> 01:43:21,980
I'd love to do that. But I did make a deeper dove after that.

855
01:43:21,980 --> 01:43:25,760
Right. So with. Urban Health Collaborative.

856
01:43:26,490 --> 01:43:30,220
I've never heard of any drugs. I mean, that was for a.

857
01:43:33,270 --> 01:43:37,450
Whatever's out there. You ready? And you know what I mean.

858
01:43:37,460 --> 01:43:41,880
Like some way you can get money in the private money that.

859
01:43:43,120 --> 01:43:47,730
And sometimes of that, Mitt Romney has a Vietnam veteran by name.

860
01:43:47,820 --> 01:43:51,139
And yes, I think we're rapidly. The scholarships.

861
01:43:51,140 --> 01:43:54,890
They sent me the post curriculum of both candidates, me and my family.

862
01:43:55,670 --> 01:44:04,719
So definitely take advantage of that given that that. Yeah.

863
01:44:04,720 --> 01:44:09,880
I just I wondered if you and then that other example of like the housing specific.

864
01:44:10,370 --> 01:44:18,170
And trust. It's like this. There are these like lots like special meetings and conferences or something that you can travel to.

865
01:44:18,890 --> 01:44:26,880
I find it funny cause you definitely have to ask your spouse or ask to that person with a stranger.

866
01:44:26,950 --> 01:44:35,990
Like, how do. I want to do this. I want to see one of the sources right now because there are a lot of things out there and all of that also.

867
01:44:36,950 --> 01:44:40,990
Not that your CV is like, I got money for this. I attended a special training.

868
01:44:43,100 --> 01:44:47,410
Taylor. Experienced astronomers being very interested in how.

869
01:44:52,400 --> 01:44:56,210
The things that are happening. I guess I wanted to.

870
01:44:56,650 --> 01:44:59,900
I have a travel terminal. Oh, yeah.

871
01:44:59,920 --> 01:45:10,100
I can't believe I. That is what the candidates feel and they can either stands up for yet professionals the.

872
01:45:32,980 --> 01:45:36,650
People. Everybody in here, anybody who doesn't.

873
01:45:44,240 --> 01:45:52,440
I'm doing a little bit around the country community and social justice and public health care reform.

874
01:45:52,460 --> 01:45:57,920
Okay. So, yeah, that's right. And it's this semester.

875
01:45:59,270 --> 01:46:05,090
It's a great cause. We pretty much talk about all the issues related to social justice and.

876
01:46:06,630 --> 01:46:09,690
How that relates to public health and why it's so important.

877
01:46:16,320 --> 01:46:19,260
And yeah, this is my first semester.

878
01:46:21,510 --> 01:46:30,180
If I could make different choices, I would not have taken so many classes this semester, taking four three credit hours.

879
01:46:32,210 --> 01:46:35,290
The GSR, and there's evidence that it has.

880
01:46:36,880 --> 01:46:42,370
And yeah, there's a lot I don't.

881
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:45,590
I'm pretty much this semester. I don't have much time for an outside research.

882
01:46:46,340 --> 01:46:50,959
The good thing is, the papers that I'm working on are all I can write in.

883
01:46:50,960 --> 01:46:58,790
Like there were provision things like you are exactly back four or five years later in the semester have already dates in November.

884
01:46:59,150 --> 01:47:02,150
So luckily that is the case for that.

885
01:47:02,150 --> 01:47:06,770
So I just don't have time to start in right now, which is kind of a bummer.

886
01:47:07,250 --> 01:47:13,130
But once I have. That's better. But you're saying that a long time.

887
01:47:20,650 --> 01:47:29,610
Yeah. This is one for the floor. So yeah, I know some of the other courses like the know you learn something different.

888
01:47:30,070 --> 01:47:38,229
I don't know Gabriel you signed for what is it the intro is going to have to that I don't I'm

889
01:47:38,230 --> 01:47:43,150
not sure if he is announcing until tomorrow and so like that was there are multiple days.

890
01:47:43,860 --> 01:47:48,090
I have a teenage years. I mean, it's still individual.

891
01:47:48,100 --> 01:47:54,879
They still have about 50 students. So yeah, I think that's kind of how it equals that number is why, you know,

892
01:47:54,880 --> 01:48:01,780
if you didn't have more than a GSI for a class, we're still looking for looking at around 40 to 60 students yourself.

893
01:48:01,900 --> 01:48:06,880
So we're going to write that you have to use that you can do.

894
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:10,270
I think you guys have such. But I don't know that.

895
01:48:10,420 --> 01:48:17,020
Yeah, so. And I thought there's just one part though. They're juniors and seniors, which is great, I think,

896
01:48:17,020 --> 01:48:22,120
because they're all political students and they're all not all of them, but a lot of them are representing this class.

897
01:48:22,540 --> 01:48:24,790
And so this is one section which is a Thursday.

898
01:48:24,790 --> 01:48:31,680
So luckily we don't have any like breakout session or anything to kind of like add on to the time commitment social for.

899
01:48:37,410 --> 01:48:41,310
And I was a little different. Yes, I think tough.

900
01:48:45,890 --> 01:48:51,600
So often that question of an active person. And they have the requirements, the hallmarks of standards that are not going to be.

901
01:48:53,000 --> 01:49:01,170
Last night when 940 I So my feeling here is I didn't have £6,000.

902
01:49:01,750 --> 01:49:14,580
Let's go. And then I had that discussion when I out that that was quite happy that that was the answer to me, that you didn't have to be a 17 year.

903
01:49:15,370 --> 01:49:26,760
He left it just because. And then also for my second year, they've been there, done that, but I've never been able to get them.

904
01:49:26,780 --> 01:49:32,930
I've had the time. It's always been multiple dialects breaking down.

905
01:49:33,030 --> 01:49:39,790
You still have it. You often have hold office hours, so keep that in mind as well.

906
01:49:41,230 --> 01:49:45,010
And so for me, I enjoyed it.

907
01:49:45,430 --> 01:49:49,680
It was like time I said a year it was alive and everything was.

908
01:49:49,680 --> 01:49:54,570
Whether you're happy for 20 years, this year is a little better because of the.

909
01:49:56,910 --> 01:50:04,530
But I would say the biggest thing that I did the prep for the orphanage is I was taught the students who were taking the ESL professors

910
01:50:05,010 --> 01:50:12,860
because that process that can really make or break their experiences in your semester since you find out what type of assignments they.

911
01:50:13,630 --> 01:50:16,780
So you're having to lie low on a computer.

912
01:50:16,780 --> 01:50:21,830
Just check that he did it. I think it's done. Or are you going to have to carry that?

913
01:50:22,580 --> 01:50:26,350
What kind of test is a multiple choice like writing that paragraph?

914
01:50:27,910 --> 01:50:32,600
How will we know that? Definitely forces need access to figure out like, how'd that?

915
01:50:32,850 --> 01:50:37,290
I guess they're worried about that. But patients are looking at you.

916
01:50:37,560 --> 01:50:41,990
What is it that we need to bury them? Are they going to be?

917
01:50:45,450 --> 01:50:52,790
They. You have to decide. So that causes child brides and kids or someone who may have.

918
01:50:53,780 --> 01:51:01,700
Sacrificing. I'm also going to argue Graner is nice because all you do is great.

919
01:51:07,160 --> 01:51:10,980
I'm right on. 6000 greater friend feels like twice.

920
01:51:18,340 --> 01:51:22,999
And then we have other students that I was a part of it.

921
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:26,970
And I talked to them, psychotherapist, as you know, the Adams.

922
01:51:30,460 --> 01:51:35,640
But I didn't have to tell you who decided this more than that.

923
01:51:36,820 --> 01:51:43,530
And so that was. Before taking on the same.

924
01:51:51,690 --> 01:51:54,060
I guess the other thing is just thinking about deciding.

925
01:51:55,200 --> 01:52:03,389
I found it like a transistor, and I felt like I had done a lot of preparation, but it was a really fun experience to do.

926
01:52:03,390 --> 01:52:12,660
And so I definitely. You can. The class.

927
01:52:12,660 --> 01:52:17,610
That is you. Thanks for the lecture, but I'm not getting that much if that's helpful.

928
01:52:17,610 --> 01:52:21,840
And I need a white paper. How did you get that? Because I did that.

929
01:52:23,370 --> 01:52:33,940
We talked about now that it's on paper. you know, we work with those investors who are also invested in that also.

930
01:52:36,890 --> 01:52:38,720
Yeah. I've been able to do that here.

931
01:52:40,790 --> 01:52:47,450
And I think one thing that stood out when I was applying because I applied to go to undergraduate in the Masters,

932
01:52:47,750 --> 01:52:49,739
of course, is to submit like one application.

933
01:52:49,740 --> 01:52:57,469
You like write your courses and then at least for the undergraduate kind of Emily reaches out to all of the

934
01:52:57,470 --> 01:53:05,510
faculty members for the class that you listed and then they interview you and I talk about your section.

935
01:53:05,990 --> 01:53:14,120
And what stood out to me with you, of course, is how committed he was to like developing,

936
01:53:14,540 --> 01:53:20,059
helping me to develop my own life style of teaching and like my own,

937
01:53:20,060 --> 01:53:28,010
like not really not real theory, but, you know, your theory around teaching and how you view it, how you want to approach it.

938
01:53:28,370 --> 01:53:33,320
And that has been super helpful, even just like the first thing I was thinking before.

939
01:53:34,100 --> 01:53:37,549
So that's really helpful. So I think that, you know,

940
01:53:37,550 --> 01:53:42,230
while you're I also getting to know facts in a very nice kind of figuring out

941
01:53:42,230 --> 01:53:45,770
their approach because some of them I just want you to just like sit in the class,

942
01:53:45,770 --> 01:53:48,860
like have office hours and great, that's about it.

943
01:53:48,860 --> 01:53:54,159
But others would have you like. And I will also be a teacher in the class.

944
01:53:54,160 --> 01:53:58,639
So. So, yeah, kind of. And then there are also other classes outside of that's great.

945
01:53:58,640 --> 01:54:07,760
As long as you can apply to. I think it just got under way in different contexts.

946
01:54:07,760 --> 01:54:19,600
Different. Faculty. Yeah. And then there are various JSF training as well as overseas.

947
01:54:19,620 --> 01:54:23,950
But. Yeah, that's right. The mind is very painful.

948
01:54:23,990 --> 01:54:38,290
You have thinking? I enjoyed it then it was mentor of mine and I know we're to like a place for him.

949
01:54:38,300 --> 01:54:43,730
So it. The bad is that the data?

950
01:54:43,730 --> 01:54:58,559
Have we had to? More seminars and you actually get a practice session with that group of students.

951
01:54:58,560 --> 01:55:03,890
And that has been the elephant in the. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

952
01:55:04,140 --> 01:55:07,410
It's not only an obvious thing to do when.

953
01:55:08,280 --> 01:55:21,920
On the record. But secondly, if I did not feel something in my life, I might not yet another selfishly bearing in mind their well-being in the fear.

954
01:55:24,250 --> 01:55:30,459
But I do know that like I have a friends over in sociology and she's a in sociology and

955
01:55:30,460 --> 01:55:34,030
they have a class that they take alongside of it's like a one great cut out of class,

956
01:55:34,030 --> 01:55:35,290
like that's how they do it.

957
01:55:35,590 --> 01:55:42,969
So I think it also depends on the department that you hear five four because she was saying that even if like I was not anonymous,

958
01:55:42,970 --> 01:55:53,620
those guys did decide for those guys, like then I would have to take that training and the 811 came down and then I thought she had to take it.

959
01:55:54,010 --> 01:55:57,180
So I don't know. Chairperson You don't have.

960
01:56:00,080 --> 01:56:16,840
Look like it could be helpful. Definitely good that. Either way, I think we talked a little bit about campaigns and other stuff.

961
01:56:17,450 --> 01:56:23,840
Thank you. I always like to ask that question of like. That the papers and things.

962
01:56:30,190 --> 01:56:36,310
Apparently that's a strategy that he's been trying so hard to kind of like.

963
01:56:38,210 --> 01:56:43,430
It's like building. Building research productivity is, of course.

964
01:56:44,220 --> 01:56:50,140
Assignments like you don't have to do that all the time when to one has.

965
01:56:51,860 --> 01:56:59,110
That's not for. When I was a first year family.

966
01:56:59,300 --> 01:57:10,040
She said that the papers they built on each other and I was stressed like, Oh God, I'm doing everything right.

967
01:57:10,490 --> 01:57:17,030
It's funny because when I started in Wisconsin, 800 been the foundation for what I have done.

968
01:57:18,320 --> 01:57:23,690
So I built upon my final paper for this Congress and the Bill of Rights that I study on that.

969
01:57:23,840 --> 01:57:26,150
I used to work form the Kremlin.

970
01:57:27,470 --> 01:57:36,799
But I also don't stress that that was the case for you, because it was really it's an exercise and it doesn't always neatly fit,

971
01:57:36,800 --> 01:57:40,550
neatly prepared for it based on your research and what you're doing.

972
01:57:41,780 --> 01:57:49,729
So I found that hearing from some people that all their papers and for each other and hearing from others that none of them informed each other.

973
01:57:49,730 --> 01:57:56,540
It was really important for me to kind of see, then have to go back to this paper and help work on, you know, something for this class.

974
01:57:56,540 --> 01:58:00,350
Or I might just throw out everything in that class because it doesn't work for me.

975
01:58:00,710 --> 01:58:01,340
And that's what I.

976
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:17,630
But I distinctly remember thing and I was like, Oh God, that first year is like the foundation equivalent of that is me on the show.

977
01:58:17,690 --> 01:58:21,110
Like every so right the second year I came in and out of it.

978
01:58:21,110 --> 01:58:22,670
We've seen how it's done in our.

979
01:58:23,140 --> 01:58:30,250
That is like pretty much every time I get knocked out in the shower, you know, it is Peter whatever it was, it was integrated.

980
01:58:30,250 --> 01:58:33,810
Those that are very placid, it was just me and.

981
01:58:35,540 --> 01:58:45,600
Anil Kapoor and Mark Freeland. But my determination was so it was never that that person.

982
01:58:47,150 --> 01:58:51,790
So I would say it. You can be open and definitely.

983
01:58:53,010 --> 01:59:02,310
But I know for me I needed to have some type of plan or I would like go crazy trying to figure out what I wanted to do with my pre-planned design.

984
01:59:02,880 --> 01:59:06,270
That's kind of how I heard that I did. Yes.

985
01:59:06,270 --> 01:59:10,430
And I think that's what I mean into buying a house.

986
01:59:11,850 --> 01:59:19,140
So that we have something to. That's kind of it.

987
01:59:19,710 --> 01:59:26,930
If I need my help, I need something that you focus on. I worked for them that.

988
01:59:31,310 --> 01:59:37,920
Some of my papers have. But on the same topic that some of them have in the past,

989
01:59:39,190 --> 01:59:44,290
I would say that the ones that have matter the most have been in favor of this path

990
01:59:44,290 --> 01:59:50,560
and in the papers because of the fact that some of their work was in the foreground.

991
01:59:52,310 --> 01:59:58,380
But. Yeah, Chris. The individual, the person is.

992
01:59:58,440 --> 02:00:02,360
And so those I think those three papers have been most helpful for me.

993
02:00:02,690 --> 02:00:11,300
Especially for like getting all my literature so I can I can do this now, but like I,

994
02:00:12,160 --> 02:00:17,090
I learned how to use the citation manager in the way that is organized and is helpful.

995
02:00:17,090 --> 02:00:26,680
And we talked a lot about that. It was very excellent and that has helped me with other papers outside of, of our courses and so those people.

996
02:00:28,300 --> 02:00:31,560
That. And so I think that'll be very helpful for.

997
02:00:36,800 --> 02:00:42,690
Everything is glass. The paper, the final grant that you write for her thoughts is probably.

998
02:00:43,670 --> 02:00:53,420
The single most helpful thing I wrote here, like in terms of like learning something new but also of holds everything together.

999
02:00:53,840 --> 02:00:57,710
And my coworkers took the positive inference like the years later.

1000
02:00:58,130 --> 02:01:05,800
But I think the theory classes and that based upon the creativity are pretty frequent.

1001
02:01:06,260 --> 02:01:12,860
So I would just I wish I kind of knew that at the time I might have approached it slightly differently in terms of topic.

1002
02:01:13,400 --> 02:01:23,030
But I think as long as you think about teaching, even if a piece of something that you write, could this be useful for in the future?

1003
02:01:23,420 --> 02:01:28,249
I think for myself, I feel like, you know what, this is a worthwhile exercise.

1004
02:01:28,250 --> 02:01:36,350
That's class. So I'm just. For the first time.

1005
02:01:36,400 --> 02:01:41,230
This is actually a pretty good idea. Just getting started in fundraising, I feel like that's providing.

1006
02:01:42,220 --> 02:01:45,390
I was pushed to kind of think about what photography.

1007
02:01:45,910 --> 02:01:52,340
But it was still very broad and then. If you're.

1008
02:01:53,640 --> 02:01:57,650
And you had to, like, crystallize your models a little bit better and then prevent.

1009
02:02:03,070 --> 02:02:07,510
Yeah. So I feel like. There's a progression.

1010
02:02:09,310 --> 02:02:22,810
But also like. Those are the theories, but they're not on the individual level.

1011
02:02:25,270 --> 02:02:34,850
And then what you have to do, the idea of like, I'm AIDS and you're trying to get a perfect conceptual model about my problem even further and.

1012
02:02:36,180 --> 02:02:42,300
And then we took the next semester looking to 85, 86, and it was a good start.

1013
02:02:43,080 --> 02:02:51,810
But I think like once learning more about different areas, I was able to further definitely change that model.

1014
02:02:52,680 --> 02:03:00,329
So I don't feel like whenever you develop this where it has to be perfect or I can't spend a ton, a ton of time writing library,

1015
02:03:00,330 --> 02:03:06,660
kind of like this is going to be like I'm forever that you'll learn new things and you know,

1016
02:03:06,720 --> 02:03:10,830
like, you know, have more knowledge later on down the path.

1017
02:03:10,880 --> 02:03:14,290
Like teenagers like come up with something very new.

1018
02:03:14,310 --> 02:03:18,900
So I think that's very wise.

1019
02:03:19,260 --> 02:03:32,660
And then the other thing remains the last. H1N1 is a research, and I think it's a very good time, in part because both of us know she talks in person.

1020
02:03:32,810 --> 02:03:36,760
But is it not for us? My first year.

1021
02:03:37,690 --> 02:03:47,430
So I don't. Right. And, you know, yeah, I think that's going to be a massive Class B investors magnet in Elizabeth.

1022
02:03:47,790 --> 02:03:51,240
So it's a big priority. I think the new.

1023
02:03:53,110 --> 02:03:58,020
Yeah. Yeah. So you think I. If the man in Damascus was your kid?

1024
02:03:58,380 --> 02:04:02,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, that kind of thing?

1025
02:04:02,160 --> 02:04:09,120
Yeah. You guys, I'll take the remaining course next semester, which is very like grant writing, funding for films.

1026
02:04:09,120 --> 02:04:13,050
That that's your deliverable. It's important to me. And. But it's also like.

1027
02:04:14,160 --> 02:04:18,540
Down very deeply intimate. Simply throw up.

1028
02:04:18,540 --> 02:04:27,570
And that side of things really has a bit different flavor because I do think about races and now I.

1029
02:04:32,840 --> 02:04:37,680
Everything I think about it. But.

1030
02:04:42,090 --> 02:04:47,930
I. We have to be more aggressive. They changed?

1031
02:04:48,740 --> 02:04:53,090
No. For the preliminary exam, you did an intervention. It has your data.

1032
02:04:54,290 --> 02:05:01,440
But in your research study, it would be for you to analyze what you're saying.

1033
02:05:01,670 --> 02:05:05,480
This argument is that you have to assess and examine.

1034
02:05:12,220 --> 02:05:15,780
Well, it was another important point.

1035
02:05:16,030 --> 02:05:22,970
Yeah, I. Yeah, that's currently just really practical creating a plane.

1036
02:05:24,470 --> 02:05:29,130
28 major tournaments linked to the.

1037
02:05:31,850 --> 02:05:40,650
20 and 34. The first part for me, 2025 is the second work, meaning 20 to 30 pages, but in total is probably 50 inches.

1038
02:05:40,670 --> 02:05:47,690
And that might not sound like a lot, but it's like really not that much.

1039
02:05:48,890 --> 02:05:52,000
I spent my last phase of room planning, so yeah,

1040
02:05:53,210 --> 02:06:01,250
I'm hoping to build off of it of the presentation for this first one we talked about, like developing the intervention.

1041
02:06:01,670 --> 02:06:04,730
Yeah. Yeah, I guess it's easier to plan.

1042
02:06:04,850 --> 02:06:10,830
Yeah, I'm planning on using. I started to my coffee, but.

1043
02:06:13,810 --> 02:06:23,299
So it's a premium structure. So the first part of the plan is you talk about a problem and you develop a conceptual model.

1044
02:06:23,300 --> 02:06:27,180
We talk about things that you're operations and the literature behind that.

1045
02:06:27,180 --> 02:06:30,510
And you felt like a. One.

1046
02:06:31,050 --> 02:06:37,190
And then the second word either. Well, I did a research studies in this case said.

1047
02:06:38,680 --> 02:06:43,600
So I think the first great intervention you can do the intervention and for the first

1048
02:06:43,600 --> 02:06:48,790
part you just talk about the problem is that part two is very topical and research.

1049
02:06:50,090 --> 02:06:56,329
How near certain is that, that consumption? I'll be talking about the details of the results you expect.

1050
02:06:56,330 --> 02:07:02,479
That means not only I mean, I'm already going to see these ideas,

1051
02:07:02,480 --> 02:07:08,750
but people in this particular country, women haven't done it before, and I enjoyed it tremendously.

1052
02:07:09,140 --> 02:07:16,640
It's like a period of time where all you have to do is focus on this like cool idea and like putting it on paper.

1053
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:20,270
And so I think a lot of people will tell you it's.

1054
02:07:21,430 --> 02:07:25,090
It's a real feeling that got very overwhelming for me.

1055
02:07:25,420 --> 02:07:28,720
And when I sat down with them, I really enjoyed the process.

1056
02:07:28,810 --> 02:07:38,680
So you might hear a lot of different takes, but that's my take, is that it's like a good time to just focus on something that you want to talk about.

1057
02:07:40,330 --> 02:07:45,070
Again, is this like conceptual model? And I think what is that part is like ultimately that.

1058
02:07:48,790 --> 02:07:53,650
It is a concern among many. You have to start with the words, you know.

1059
02:07:58,340 --> 02:08:05,840
Yeah. I can take my students.

1060
02:08:05,840 --> 02:08:13,280
I'm going to do that, actually, because I think that the Prime Minister's department is very supportive and very late,

1061
02:08:14,110 --> 02:08:18,920
like this change also seems a bit like. Since the wheels.

1062
02:08:21,330 --> 02:08:26,040
What they want is that the to sit with an idea like a topic of your own and.

1063
02:08:27,540 --> 02:08:34,380
Plan a project of your own and just write about it. You don't like doing that.

1064
02:08:35,520 --> 02:08:42,870
But my research grants are going to be really hard to engage in because I think this is really good practice for doing that.

1065
02:08:44,370 --> 02:08:50,250
As opposed to other departments and other equipment, other types of government stands that are really like many of the same.

1066
02:08:51,130 --> 02:08:58,970
Of like mastering a body of knowledge. That's your videos, and we haven't found anything about that.

1067
02:08:59,120 --> 02:09:08,190
This is like 180 degrees from that. So. There's very different ways to approach these sort of things, elementary grammar and so on.

1068
02:09:09,750 --> 02:09:16,969
But I agree, it's a very. I don't know that from my perspective.

1069
02:09:16,970 --> 02:09:20,170
That's like. Yeah, very practical. Yeah.

1070
02:09:20,930 --> 02:09:26,530
I think I, I kind of feel like it'd be helpful to some the other part, but I think.

1071
02:09:27,920 --> 02:09:38,160
It's not from. And it's interesting because it sounds like companies are qualifying for many different departments to introduce this.

1072
02:09:38,220 --> 02:09:43,800
So different. So, you know, I think this person finds that the way that this department doesn't.

1073
02:09:48,320 --> 02:09:52,100
Happy to talk about these ideas.

1074
02:09:53,390 --> 02:10:01,530
Anyway. And I think for them it's also the time between a science and what you're doing it yourself.

1075
02:10:02,500 --> 02:10:07,690
Going through the process of doing it or something, but it's much more informed by.

1076
02:10:14,680 --> 02:10:17,350
Don't go over here. You have to come back here.

1077
02:10:19,110 --> 02:10:24,980
If God told me not to go into the weeds several times during my recent meetings, but I think I really agree.

1078
02:10:25,180 --> 02:10:28,840
I think our preliminary in this department is focused on.

1079
02:10:29,680 --> 02:10:34,180
Do you have an idea? Can you communicate that clearly as a public health problem?

1080
02:10:34,690 --> 02:10:38,820
And can you concisely describe a program that.

1081
02:10:39,570 --> 02:10:42,630
Analyze and assess this problem. And do know.

1082
02:10:44,530 --> 02:10:46,420
So it's extremely straightforward.

1083
02:10:47,020 --> 02:10:54,250
I'm not doing the exact thing in my dissertation, and that's a big thing because Brian really needs something, right?

1084
02:10:54,340 --> 02:10:59,290
That's me. Right at the end of my first year with. It was a big jump through it.

1085
02:10:59,710 --> 02:11:04,450
Like you're sometimes wearing it don't fit neatly into these hoops that you just do it.

1086
02:11:04,900 --> 02:11:09,820
But I also think like, I remember, like texting myself when I was done and I was like,

1087
02:11:09,820 --> 02:11:13,640
I enjoyed this, like this whole thing because people stress about it a lot.

1088
02:11:13,690 --> 02:11:17,760
But I think some advice that I have is talking.

1089
02:11:20,650 --> 02:11:26,380
I'm writing a book on this and we make it work.

1090
02:11:26,980 --> 02:11:34,770
And so explaining something to her was a really good exercise for me to say, like, can I communicate this clearly?

1091
02:11:34,780 --> 02:11:43,299
Because that's why I had to do what it's like for somebody who might not know anything about this like obscure idea in terms of like,

1092
02:11:43,300 --> 02:11:48,590
can I do this in a concise, accurate literature?

1093
02:11:49,640 --> 02:11:56,200
So. You bring up a good point because kind of going back to what we talked about earlier,

1094
02:11:56,260 --> 02:12:02,690
like not all of your papers have to be with the topic or like kind of relate to one another in a way.

1095
02:12:03,650 --> 02:12:09,190
You know, that would be nice if you like prelim. And I mean like you said, something had to be in there.

1096
02:12:09,200 --> 02:12:12,769
So I'm not saying I'm excited to do it, but it's something that I have to do.

1097
02:12:12,770 --> 02:12:19,180
And for me, I do it as a way of like doing something creative that I know is not feasible for any situation.

1098
02:12:19,430 --> 02:12:23,480
And so that's why I kind of have an idea what I want to write about,

1099
02:12:23,490 --> 02:12:29,090
partly because I know I'm not going to get to do that for this case and do too much work, too time consuming.

1100
02:12:29,360 --> 02:12:35,330
If not, it's not going to work for my dissertation. It's a nap after work or something.

1101
02:12:35,720 --> 02:12:39,670
So I think to you know, that's another example.

1102
02:12:39,870 --> 02:12:43,550
Like, I know this isn't going to be like useful for my dissertation, but.

1103
02:12:44,430 --> 02:12:48,860
I want to talk about something that I want to explore more, like with the Vietnam War.

1104
02:12:48,920 --> 02:12:57,909
That is a useful way of doing it. And even if the writing isn't useful.

1105
02:12:57,910 --> 02:13:07,000
But, you know, in that process of like making your face, developing your love for your pets or likewise their sister and then that.

1106
02:13:09,320 --> 02:13:13,230
And it is like the getting of these is his comment, right?

1107
02:13:13,270 --> 02:13:18,379
Like I feel like get into the weeds on something that's certainly helpful to people.

1108
02:13:18,380 --> 02:13:27,230
Like, okay. Also, like, I'd be able to describe my measures in enough detail, but I can't go here.

1109
02:13:27,230 --> 02:13:37,340
I have to be on the fence. And I have to say more than this. And my so don't like, you know, sort of it's like very limited in terms of what the task.

1110
02:13:38,290 --> 02:13:44,080
Oh, yeah. I was going through this whole contract in my novel, but right now it's out there that there's just too much, you know?

1111
02:13:45,350 --> 02:13:49,650
So. So this isn't something that you have.

1112
02:13:49,670 --> 02:13:59,040
And then like. So how? There's nothing.

1113
02:14:00,190 --> 02:14:09,979
I thought. And so when you describe your methods, when you don't like who doesn't like you, they tell you in the studio and with resources,

1114
02:14:09,980 --> 02:14:18,450
which is, Oh, I want to see my mother, but I only go on through my to look at this population and we're defeated.

1115
02:14:18,580 --> 02:14:21,709
But I think we like it.

1116
02:14:21,710 --> 02:14:26,090
But if you think about it, it's like the exercise is like really like what is the sample?

1117
02:14:26,090 --> 02:14:29,260
How do I pick these people? What are the right methods for that?

1118
02:14:29,570 --> 02:14:36,920
So it's like hypothetical in science, but very much grounded in practical stones filled with research skills.

1119
02:14:36,980 --> 02:14:40,990
So you're not have enough funding or access.

1120
02:14:43,660 --> 02:14:44,860
You just like a suit. Oh.

1121
02:14:46,570 --> 02:14:53,139
I think you could be like if you said before, just take on the client, like doing a mental health intervention for the school, for example.

1122
02:14:53,140 --> 02:15:02,290
So, like, if you were going to do that, what would be the people you need to talk to in the school environment to make that happen?

1123
02:15:02,320 --> 02:15:09,580
And that would be important to address that versus saying like, Oh yeah, I'm going to recruit kids from the community.

1124
02:15:09,580 --> 02:15:16,450
And they're often, you know, giving some, you know, just you also address challenges, challenges.

1125
02:15:16,450 --> 02:15:23,310
But I think it's more about recognizing what would be a challenge then, like how do you exactly execute that?

1126
02:15:26,390 --> 02:15:32,740
Yeah. But I can't feel like it's been. And more recently that if it stretches like that.

1127
02:15:32,760 --> 02:15:37,110
So yeah. And then also Christie will come and talk to us about.

1128
02:15:40,460 --> 02:15:44,240
There's a lot to. That's right.

1129
02:15:45,600 --> 02:15:59,230
Though I think it's one thing. Other thoughts?

1130
02:15:59,440 --> 02:16:03,440
What else is on the list? Oh, part goals for post time.

1131
02:16:05,850 --> 02:16:16,120
Like people talked about, like, oh, there was this period where. And right now, I mean, I don't know if you're up for that.

1132
02:16:16,670 --> 02:16:20,060
I'm like, your kind of class structure has changed and you're not.

1133
02:16:20,070 --> 02:16:30,560
And I think you might want to take some time to read my research in class, like any sort of ideas or strategies or like.

1134
02:16:33,270 --> 02:16:38,460
You know, ways to kind of utilize that time and make a plan for as much as I can.

1135
02:16:40,590 --> 02:16:43,680
I think a lot of I think it's common for people to take.

1136
02:16:44,770 --> 02:16:51,060
I did not take his number. When I started working, I think like next week.

1137
02:16:51,690 --> 02:16:56,629
But that's also because. I have this thing that I follow.

1138
02:16:56,630 --> 02:17:02,240
Like, I'm excited about something. It doesn't matter. So my progression, like my to do list, I just do.

1139
02:17:02,240 --> 02:17:08,420
I want to be excited about it. And so I feel it really, really energize me for certain aspects of things that I have to do.

1140
02:17:08,870 --> 02:17:14,450
So I just did it when I wanted to do things that were going to be less popular.

1141
02:17:14,840 --> 02:17:22,309
But I think, you know, I'm myself navigating that right now where I have one last box and taking I a lot

1142
02:17:22,310 --> 02:17:27,700
of unstructured free time and working with perspective and putting together many.

1143
02:17:28,190 --> 02:17:35,900
And I think there's also put people in the third year because it's like you just have so much free time.

1144
02:17:36,410 --> 02:17:42,320
But I think something people forget is that the time that you're not that is unstructured.

1145
02:17:42,350 --> 02:17:46,790
You're still thinking, they're still processing, you're working through challenges, really.

1146
02:17:47,840 --> 02:17:51,590
You know, you don't have to be doing constantly being productive.

1147
02:17:51,600 --> 02:18:01,820
And so it's a something I sometimes like sometimes they do get us thinking on how to solve problems or research like great thoughts, right?

1148
02:18:02,150 --> 02:18:09,020
But I think that's something that I was encouraged to even write when it happened to be time and not like just be doing something productive.

1149
02:18:09,500 --> 02:18:17,239
You're still working on your ideas and not difficult for me to kind of feel like regressed is productive,

1150
02:18:17,240 --> 02:18:20,510
but I also feel like I'm on task at the same time.

1151
02:18:23,890 --> 02:18:31,860
So. Yeah. So I love a day.

1152
02:18:32,340 --> 02:18:37,980
I honestly take time off on the freelance. So my life was at a premium.

1153
02:18:39,270 --> 02:18:43,670
So hopefully at large these are premium rates to nothing. So it was over a.

1154
02:18:44,480 --> 02:18:47,600
What happened here. It's a question about what's going to happen.

1155
02:18:48,070 --> 02:18:55,040
I had a death and I think like to point out that they did not relapse and I think that's sometimes reason just describe it I that.

1156
02:18:55,540 --> 02:19:02,459
Billings. Life is difficult for everybody. And so my third year I did a lot of teaching and also to the classes.

1157
02:19:02,460 --> 02:19:07,540
So. He'd say he'd take my class. I had posted in the first semester.

1158
02:19:07,540 --> 02:19:11,860
I only had a different name, so I knew that another structure.

1159
02:19:12,160 --> 02:19:16,230
But my first year I pretty much just kind of. Because again.

1160
02:19:16,810 --> 02:19:22,030
I wanted to do something that I wanted to. Yeah.

1161
02:19:22,030 --> 02:19:26,580
I could find back in the day here I worked with. And I did a solo break.

1162
02:19:27,210 --> 02:19:31,490
So that was not all there in here. That was kind of the. I say fourth year.

1163
02:19:31,820 --> 02:19:35,690
And then while I was active, my school was there.

1164
02:19:35,990 --> 02:19:39,719
I was in Saint Louis. I left it. I was following that there.

1165
02:19:39,720 --> 02:19:44,000
And year I was able to just bring in some. Here to figure out what I want.

1166
02:19:44,330 --> 02:19:48,260
My dissertation. And I did send in that proposal.

1167
02:19:49,160 --> 02:19:58,360
Around this time I had defended my dissertation. Over here with a new curriculum that has been undertaken in the premium.

1168
02:19:58,750 --> 02:20:05,260
I think it might that I spoken. You think they're here, but you don't have to.

1169
02:20:06,030 --> 02:20:13,320
The whole process. Most of it is witnessed in the fourth year of the fourth year because they didn't necessarily.

1170
02:20:14,740 --> 02:20:21,840
For premium because the format. The format where you can have your ring with everything, with your finger, with rain of every.

1171
02:20:22,410 --> 02:20:26,950
Nothing can be able to get do to. He that in part.

1172
02:20:27,460 --> 02:20:31,470
You know I mean so now we're you have that you can really focus on.

1173
02:20:32,130 --> 02:20:35,580
Want to do it. And so I did that.

1174
02:20:39,520 --> 02:20:44,050
I would never say anything more than what happened out of the one year that's left without having the premium that.

1175
02:20:46,650 --> 02:20:52,730
And now we're. And so that, you know, I this time is not three or four years in the future.

1176
02:20:55,290 --> 02:21:02,500
It was for her, you know, trying to get something out of. Adviser and then on that will have a section.

1177
02:21:02,910 --> 02:21:07,050
For like a year. But it is about structure.

1178
02:21:07,200 --> 02:21:13,800
I mean, it is kind of hard times. It's like in the Ukraine where maybe for the next three years.

1179
02:21:17,430 --> 02:21:23,750
The structure to think of the structure of a cohort within writing groups.

1180
02:21:23,910 --> 02:21:32,690
Some are actually writing groups together. That's awesome.

1181
02:21:34,750 --> 02:21:38,350
Finding a social support network in your memory that you're just not a student.

1182
02:21:39,510 --> 02:21:46,220
So I can have another like this again. It is often very helpful, but I mean, I think.

1183
02:21:46,620 --> 02:21:52,970
The two biggest stars during their respective. Minute dissertation.

1184
02:21:58,810 --> 02:22:08,190
You are even more eager to even. I have to work on this one because I think it's going to work.

1185
02:22:09,190 --> 02:22:15,970
In the last year. You know, I've never done it, but I saw something writing about the sit down.

1186
02:22:16,230 --> 02:22:20,500
What is your time? Your time? Like what it takes to be there.

1187
02:22:21,460 --> 02:22:25,600
Are you most productive in the morning when you like to write or enjoy during the night?

1188
02:22:25,990 --> 02:22:32,980
I'm good on Tuesdays, so in my second year, something I really wanted to do was like, What is that time for me?

1189
02:22:33,520 --> 02:22:38,570
And so I structured my. This semester as well.

1190
02:22:39,220 --> 02:22:42,500
I, I like having Friday something to write.

1191
02:22:44,450 --> 02:22:49,219
So I have nothing to hide in my design meetings Wednesday and meetings Tuesday.

1192
02:22:49,220 --> 02:22:52,790
Thursday. I have no idea because those are my work days that I just like.

1193
02:22:52,790 --> 02:23:01,430
Right? That's my time and the thing. So I think that is something I think you're limited in your classes and then you have other commitments.

1194
02:23:01,910 --> 02:23:05,510
But I think something that was very helpful in my seven years figuring out.

1195
02:23:06,420 --> 02:23:18,299
What is the best time for me thinking twice a year, you know. And the second thing I wanted to say is I also experienced kind of like research

1196
02:23:18,300 --> 02:23:23,070
depression after feeling like I was just so like I was kind of just like

1197
02:23:23,070 --> 02:23:30,660
exhausted and unexcited about what is going on for a while and something that

1198
02:23:30,870 --> 02:23:36,620
right in my eyes only encouraged me to do and let me find expert opinions and,

1199
02:23:37,110 --> 02:23:40,150
you know, work on these other things you're excited about.

1200
02:23:40,620 --> 02:23:50,940
And then like, so my goal for the start of year three never realized that I was going to be excited about this dissertation topic and I got there.

1201
02:23:51,060 --> 02:23:58,830
But it did take a while and it's a it's also I think it's okay to have those, those times when you don't want to talk about your research,

1202
02:23:58,830 --> 02:24:03,719
you don't want to read about your research work as I don't like irritates routines you like.

1203
02:24:03,720 --> 02:24:11,760
That's okay too. But I think having someone to kind of still knock off they seem to get that motivators.

1204
02:24:11,760 --> 02:24:19,260
I'm pretty. And really, it's not pressure yourself to always be as important as.

1205
02:24:21,860 --> 02:24:28,210
Time that's really helpful to you is just thinking about it for so long.

1206
02:24:28,310 --> 02:24:35,510
It's like a mini version of a proposal, and so there's always like something to be done, but like some of those are like really satisfying.

1207
02:24:35,520 --> 02:24:42,280
And I'm like, I got to do these things that sort of they're not thinking like, I don't need to be inspired to be doing them.

1208
02:24:42,280 --> 02:24:44,629
And that is sort of like get it done.

1209
02:24:44,630 --> 02:24:51,020
And then like putting someone in a bigger time that you have are like this broader thought and inspiration and stuff.

1210
02:24:52,330 --> 02:25:01,629
And I was going to ask also because I think the housing scope interview reminded me like, um, so like in this paper, this class,

1211
02:25:01,630 --> 02:25:06,670
we do like a little literature review to kind of just get your arms around the topic a little bit,

1212
02:25:06,670 --> 02:25:10,629
but then sometimes that could go on to be a remarkable thing.

1213
02:25:10,630 --> 02:25:16,610
But like you guys found. Like especially learning about a new topic or like.

1214
02:25:18,660 --> 02:25:23,470
Has it been helpful or have you tried to like turn that into a publication?

1215
02:25:23,550 --> 02:25:28,080
Has that been a good use of the time or is it. I don't know.

1216
02:25:28,090 --> 02:25:33,370
It's probably just. That's my comment. But I. Do you think that would be?

1217
02:25:33,400 --> 02:25:40,440
That would be some time. If you really are delving into this new topic area or like the lending topic areas,

1218
02:25:40,530 --> 02:25:49,580
which I think the service market could become a smoking gun, other people are serving in that happen.

1219
02:25:51,140 --> 02:25:55,380
I mean, we met with Kate Sailing Librarian and she. It's awesome.

1220
02:25:55,400 --> 02:26:03,600
I have time for people in lots of different stages to earn like as students or have done it before.

1221
02:26:04,830 --> 02:26:10,030
So I don't know if there's. Lots of people have done that in terms of being strategic.

1222
02:26:12,620 --> 02:26:17,320
Writing. Peter Schrager.

1223
02:26:19,920 --> 02:26:23,940
Or. I was.

1224
02:26:25,380 --> 02:26:28,890
And that was the best use of life.

1225
02:26:29,280 --> 02:26:31,380
Well, after this, I don't like it.

1226
02:26:35,770 --> 02:26:44,430
I just have that is very is very time consuming, which is the hard part for me, because I like to do things in spurts.

1227
02:26:44,440 --> 02:26:49,599
I don't like to sit there and do things on longer time either.

1228
02:26:49,600 --> 02:26:54,669
So that's the time I can if I have to, but it's not my preference.

1229
02:26:54,670 --> 02:26:59,650
So I feel like let her views integrity review takes up a lot of time in education,

1230
02:27:00,430 --> 02:27:05,799
but it was great because I was working on another paper with my advisor as well,

1231
02:27:05,800 --> 02:27:14,560
and so the review process helped me to remain confident and really gain more understanding for the other projects that we had three down the pipeline.

1232
02:27:14,860 --> 02:27:18,969
So I think that that is I think the way I would advise approaching it,

1233
02:27:18,970 --> 02:27:26,740
like if you're going to take the time to do everything for it, that it's going to be very helpful for you in other areas.

1234
02:27:27,130 --> 02:27:35,020
And not just to do it just because like it's a good idea, like make sure that that review is going to be really useful for you in the future.

1235
02:27:35,020 --> 02:27:45,050
So I do see the value in them now that I like the guy, but I think the best part about it is I can use it for anything.

1236
02:27:46,790 --> 02:27:53,810
I am company. I built upon my resume for this class and I love her literature.

1237
02:27:53,990 --> 02:28:01,550
I'm glad I'm studying, so that makes it much easier to find something that I did.

1238
02:28:02,300 --> 02:28:04,400
My sentence was your first year when I started.

1239
02:28:04,760 --> 02:28:15,300
An interesting, really great group of parents for this topic was an inspirational interviews with topic experts, and it was so helpful for me.

1240
02:28:15,320 --> 02:28:18,650
So I'm interested every clinician or fiction person on this.

1241
02:28:19,130 --> 02:28:26,630
So my idea to bring on interviews with a woman who is the primary publisher on that topic.

1242
02:28:27,110 --> 02:28:34,280
She didn't happen. We just reach out to her and I love her. She was really helpful in identifying other people who I should focus on.

1243
02:28:35,150 --> 02:28:39,290
I spoke to several clinicians at Michigan who deal with that issue and are interested,

1244
02:28:39,290 --> 02:28:47,570
and so they've really been playing in the direction of like these journals or I have really focused my my own search.

1245
02:28:48,110 --> 02:28:51,480
So I think, well, at the time it was kind of like an eyeroll.

1246
02:28:52,690 --> 02:29:00,790
Do these interviews. But it was really helpful and getting good direction in terms of which offers to focus on

1247
02:29:00,790 --> 02:29:08,319
which journals to focus on and also isolate even just specific topics that I might find in

1248
02:29:08,320 --> 02:29:15,760
the review that to my audience the questions that they found important so that it also helps

1249
02:29:15,880 --> 02:29:22,480
to guide the content of the review and why that is good for not for every single topic.

1250
02:29:23,090 --> 02:29:27,370
I think that's trying to figure.

1251
02:29:34,140 --> 02:29:37,190
Been. Scary.

1252
02:29:37,320 --> 02:29:43,480
That's always scary. And I guess I don't know.

1253
02:29:43,500 --> 02:29:46,640
I think, like, maybe many other things around. I don't know.

1254
02:29:46,650 --> 02:29:54,390
I mean, I feel like funding is often a discussion, among other things, around around the management department.

1255
02:29:59,360 --> 02:30:19,400
Anything that know. This incident took place at.

1256
02:30:20,690 --> 02:30:26,050
Same is like. Companies that.

1257
02:30:41,710 --> 02:30:50,000
I'm sure he rejected it. We all more like this ceremony.

1258
02:30:51,290 --> 02:30:55,460
Much bigger, but for me, like because I don't have that much experience.

1259
02:30:59,020 --> 02:31:09,210
But then just moving on to. But I think there's just a lot in the matter of really taking a chance.

1260
02:31:21,910 --> 02:31:33,330
Been. I. And we also talked to one of the professors had a water bottle for the campus next.

1261
02:31:35,980 --> 02:31:45,450
Okay. So, like, you gave me a lot of your information and I'm at the town development conference and so I might I might try to go.

1262
02:31:46,400 --> 02:31:50,480
So she was just telling me, like, it's a great company. Smaller.

1263
02:31:51,210 --> 02:31:53,640
So. And it's been like February.

1264
02:31:53,640 --> 02:32:02,160
So timing wise, it probably will be the first conference without a major conference since before holding like a person.

1265
02:32:02,880 --> 02:32:09,270
You know, I also am not the type of person that really likes talking to people and networking and like doing those things.

1266
02:32:09,280 --> 02:32:14,250
Like I like meeting people. What is their duty, what they do in a conference setting a lot different.

1267
02:32:15,060 --> 02:32:18,360
So, so yeah. So I think that that would the.

1268
02:32:21,990 --> 02:32:26,400
My friends, I helped identify a comfort zone.

1269
02:32:27,560 --> 02:32:36,680
A conference in a society that we never did participate in. And something that I think was kind of difficult for me is why are there societies

1270
02:32:36,680 --> 02:32:40,250
that are nice for me and my work and what are things that are kind of like that?

1271
02:32:40,280 --> 02:32:48,660
Because the mine right now that might be easier and rightfully recommended choosing one society to be again like

1272
02:32:49,220 --> 02:32:56,959
kind of like your main conference I need to focus but I'm also extremely interested in like the rotation science.

1273
02:32:56,960 --> 02:33:01,190
So always before taking science conferences are so interesting to me, you know,

1274
02:33:01,790 --> 02:33:07,189
but like the those right now are not most like the best places for me to present my work.

1275
02:33:07,190 --> 02:33:13,669
So that also kind of like I think it tension you have to choose or if also in your previous life if you are doing research in

1276
02:33:13,670 --> 02:33:19,090
this area that conference is about the best thing to do here I think might not be the best conferences for you at this stage.

1277
02:33:19,100 --> 02:33:22,820
And I think that, you know,

1278
02:33:22,970 --> 02:33:31,490
sometimes you're confronted you go to a lot of the conferences in a previous role and that's just like like what is your topic in this, too?

1279
02:33:31,490 --> 02:33:35,080
And I think keeping up with your audience is great. Work is important to me.

1280
02:33:35,680 --> 02:33:44,410
And that's. Because there's nothing to buy Verizon Wireless headphones, they said last week.

1281
02:33:45,360 --> 02:33:50,210
And her advice to me was so I don't know, I haven't been in to take this advice thoroughly,

1282
02:33:50,340 --> 02:33:56,340
but that her advice to me and her family was to also find and she was basically saying,

1283
02:33:56,340 --> 02:34:02,750
like, that's why it's important to have different mentors, because different mentors use different funding mechanisms very well.

1284
02:34:02,760 --> 02:34:12,360
So like there will be people who I mean, they speak their language and they do really well and others who they do a lot of like Gerry Ford and I

1285
02:34:12,390 --> 02:34:17,280
thought she was a thing like that's why it's important also to have different mentors because they will

1286
02:34:17,280 --> 02:34:22,919
be able to answer your questions better about different funding mechanisms because not everybody is going

1287
02:34:22,920 --> 02:34:28,020
to be able to apply to all these different studies but funding mechanisms and be able to get them.

1288
02:34:28,020 --> 02:34:31,170
So. So I think that that's really important too.

1289
02:34:31,740 --> 02:34:36,180
It's like not like asking different people the same questions.

1290
02:34:36,180 --> 02:34:40,380
They kind of like get more information from different faculty members.

1291
02:34:42,390 --> 02:34:47,740
Working with people. I'm going to take you to get it right now.

1292
02:34:47,890 --> 02:34:55,330
How is it? You know, he was very excited about it, but I never really had experience here.

1293
02:34:55,910 --> 02:34:59,500
I think I share the money that they give us.

1294
02:34:59,500 --> 02:35:03,280
It's very likely money to go to conferences and trainings and stuff.

1295
02:35:03,800 --> 02:35:09,210
It's I think it's also. What am I hoping to get out of this?

1296
02:35:09,300 --> 02:35:13,920
What am I getting out of this and kind of do with this?

1297
02:35:14,310 --> 02:35:23,460
No. One funding source and. You know, everything is so I for me to reflect their perspective, I'm like, why am I taking this thing?

1298
02:35:23,730 --> 02:35:30,450
What do I do that I've been looking at more realistically that my romanticized version of virus.

1299
02:35:30,730 --> 02:35:39,470
I mean, so. Yeah. I've talked to him about finding something that can protect my brand.

1300
02:35:40,670 --> 02:35:44,460
Not anymore. But they were planning on running at 31.

1301
02:35:48,660 --> 02:35:52,530
I imagine. But I do want to.

1302
02:35:53,250 --> 02:35:58,220
It's an age. I don't know. How long is that the same as that?

1303
02:35:58,440 --> 02:36:03,299
Because I know that night of the house, like I was just like a celebrity.

1304
02:36:03,300 --> 02:36:08,250
It's like a supplemental grant that, like, I don't know if that's the same thing.

1305
02:36:08,370 --> 02:36:14,609
That's different, it's different, but it's also really good. So like, if your advisor doesn't have any independent projects,

1306
02:36:14,610 --> 02:36:23,879
you know that I can apply for supplemental funding that will fund it is like something that's doing something that your advisor is so lucky.

1307
02:36:23,880 --> 02:36:28,680
I have that supplemental funding, but it's like to fund your project.

1308
02:36:29,250 --> 02:36:37,120
So that's, that's pretty neat. And then at 31 is even better like one louder and that like you want to finish that project.

1309
02:36:37,350 --> 02:36:45,600
So it could be the same thing as a 31, usually building on an existing something that's happening.

1310
02:36:45,600 --> 02:36:50,900
So that way that a lot more happens behind it as opposed to like a dissertation on.

1311
02:36:53,030 --> 02:36:56,330
Study. But it is to my dissertation.

1312
02:36:56,750 --> 02:37:01,410
Not in the study. So. I think he would, too, when I was 20.

1313
02:37:01,590 --> 02:37:07,830
And somebody like you could develop a brand idea for in the working class or like whatever,

1314
02:37:07,950 --> 02:37:12,840
you know, whatever point 4 million something in Germany did in those first four.

1315
02:37:14,180 --> 02:37:18,740
And, you know, say work on your Pfizer supplement.

1316
02:37:19,540 --> 02:37:23,710
Those are often a lot easier to get that and a lot better.

1317
02:37:23,740 --> 02:37:26,770
Yeah. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1318
02:37:26,830 --> 02:37:34,720
I mean, they're playing at times right now, but it it's kind of amazing.

1319
02:37:34,790 --> 02:37:38,679
There's lots of different things, Minister, to supplement a diversity supplement.

1320
02:37:38,680 --> 02:37:44,510
And it's great for the project because it's like, Oh my God, I don't read nutrition, I'm working.

1321
02:37:44,530 --> 02:37:51,070
We have now. I mean, we have two supplements for that project and one was like, Hey, we have this additional idea.

1322
02:37:51,670 --> 02:37:57,220
And we've actually been kind of collecting the data for an awful on and like that we got funders too

1323
02:37:57,290 --> 02:38:02,440
like so we're like looking for that and stop using those other like sources are scrambling for it.

1324
02:38:02,980 --> 02:38:07,380
And then the other one is the diversity supplement for an actual students project on that.

1325
02:38:07,410 --> 02:38:13,719
I like that, but I don't want to do that study. So I do because they're fantastic for it.

1326
02:38:13,720 --> 02:38:15,820
And then, you know, if you don't get it,

1327
02:38:16,270 --> 02:38:23,649
then have like a really good balance and has 31 applications with a tiny amount and I don't know those things.

1328
02:38:23,650 --> 02:38:24,670
On the topic of training,

1329
02:38:24,670 --> 02:38:38,470
these are different from the standard of I think you might find out don't a very yeah but yeah like and then you just you like you have a first draft

1330
02:38:39,160 --> 02:38:48,100
proposal that you might want to accept that doesn't work and I mean you see that you tweak it again slightly and properties apply to other places.

1331
02:38:48,110 --> 02:38:55,870
I think you can find that same idea at the places and I didn't learn through personal experience that like when you apply something,

1332
02:38:55,880 --> 02:39:00,670
when you do that and you name the thing exactly the same thing, don't do that.

1333
02:39:01,210 --> 02:39:04,810
I think that if you like, you just get funded through it.

1334
02:39:04,860 --> 02:39:09,950
Yeah, I'm I'm sorry. I mean, know, you don't you don't get double funding for a single project before this.

1335
02:39:10,030 --> 02:39:17,340
And that's what we did. We like applying for. And I eat at American Heart Association to like the specificity project.

1336
02:39:19,350 --> 02:39:25,330
And so we basically like expanded the number of people we could have.

1337
02:39:25,360 --> 02:39:27,000
And we also had a suite of.

1338
02:39:27,300 --> 02:39:33,990
Answer to the second proposal in a proposal that was being the same thing, I used to be able to have children or something like that.

1339
02:39:34,620 --> 02:39:42,380
And so. We did that, that sort of thing, and it worked out and we ended up getting funding for both projects,

1340
02:39:42,530 --> 02:39:46,850
which was great, but, but just, it's just a word to the wise.

1341
02:39:47,600 --> 02:39:52,460
So yeah, the idea of like developing a single, you know, application.

1342
02:39:53,860 --> 02:39:58,560
As I said, at 31, it's just like three practice. If I want to.

1343
02:39:58,590 --> 02:40:02,749
I don't know if anybody knows teach these students in nursing, but like that's what they do.

1344
02:40:02,750 --> 02:40:05,990
That's why they went to class to do it.

1345
02:40:06,920 --> 02:40:11,450
It's like they really jam through the pieces for about six months to a year.

1346
02:40:11,570 --> 02:40:16,280
So it's like you're having three questions and I think it's a little too bad, but it's.

1347
02:40:16,950 --> 02:40:22,700
Just really bad. I know. For a better sense of life the minute I got married.

1348
02:40:23,150 --> 02:40:27,150
So. And then about 32, it's the same idea.

1349
02:40:28,980 --> 02:40:35,850
Doctoral grant and 1932. Training for.

1350
02:40:37,440 --> 02:40:44,550
His sister is. The fact the teams are engaging, right.

1351
02:40:47,170 --> 02:40:54,460
And aren't they also the summer apps, the apps that are inside the central grid?

1352
02:40:58,000 --> 02:41:01,430
So somebody that say the same. Honduras.

1353
02:41:02,410 --> 02:41:06,190
Missions like these in April, in Berkeley, February.

1354
02:41:08,810 --> 02:41:12,200
There isn't a 31 diversity settlement.

1355
02:41:19,120 --> 02:41:25,910
But I also think. Yeah. I was going to say sometimes it's a little bit like bowling because a lot of them have that.

1356
02:41:26,390 --> 02:41:32,830
I understand you may a more but not. Extra money to go around certain times.

1357
02:41:33,210 --> 02:41:39,740
I need to get that money out the door. Perhaps you're here to finance.

1358
02:41:43,130 --> 02:41:49,790
There's like certain strategies around where, you know, you're more likely to have your person plucked from the pile for funding.

1359
02:41:51,730 --> 02:41:57,100
You're content in your physical years.

1360
02:41:57,100 --> 02:42:03,220
But there's something that a lot of young women think about that I used to have.

1361
02:42:07,200 --> 02:42:10,350
It's always good to do that. And everybody has been part.

1362
02:42:11,350 --> 02:42:18,610
Covers funding, but I. Let's see how it find.

1363
02:42:24,470 --> 02:42:31,490
With 20% thinking about the same thing you had mentioned, like figuring out where they can answer your question with just to make sense.

1364
02:42:32,540 --> 02:42:36,990
Not and I don't know if people if they're strategies everyone has about that idea.

1365
02:42:37,010 --> 02:42:40,370
I think that that's kind of it's without question.

1366
02:42:41,160 --> 02:42:46,980
Yeah. The topic I think I talked to a couple of scholars in the area.

1367
02:42:48,820 --> 02:42:58,149
From business area and I need to talk about. One I started, she was like, Oh, I'm excited about returning today.

1368
02:42:58,150 --> 02:43:01,030
I heard this idea. She's like, There's nothing there.

1369
02:43:01,450 --> 02:43:06,909
So that was really helpful for me because I was like, Okay, I'm going to write something down with her.

1370
02:43:06,910 --> 02:43:13,120
But I also think like. There's also.

1371
02:43:14,110 --> 02:43:17,490
And for a pregnant woman, there's a lot of phone calls.

1372
02:43:18,550 --> 02:43:27,560
Dana and I will put her in. He is excellent for this low cost Geiger counter.

1373
02:43:28,010 --> 02:43:31,530
So I know he. Interesting as well.

1374
02:43:31,530 --> 02:43:36,810
But I think I'm talking to scholars who are using. Innocent people die.

1375
02:43:37,250 --> 02:43:43,780
Oh, that's a really good place to start. You know, if there's anything that's out there.

1376
02:43:51,110 --> 02:43:54,880
I will start. I'll try.

1377
02:44:01,120 --> 02:44:16,330
You may just have to filter like that. I think that's absurd.

1378
02:44:16,800 --> 02:44:23,690
I think one of the good things about our department is you have to figure out how to determine for us is even though there is a downside to that.

1379
02:44:24,020 --> 02:44:27,729
I think the good thing is like I'm thinking. Over again.

1380
02:44:27,730 --> 02:44:33,690
I've seen that sports and we're using all kinds of different public things that

1381
02:44:33,850 --> 02:44:37,570
I've heard about but didn't really realize how they might be helpful for me.

1382
02:44:38,560 --> 02:44:45,250
And so I think that that's one good thing about taking classes outside and like asking those questions and like,

1383
02:44:46,150 --> 02:44:51,760
you know, using their data that they provide in the course that I know some courses will let you use their own data.

1384
02:44:52,070 --> 02:45:03,270
Like if you really use their data. I know I have that have.

1385
02:45:04,030 --> 02:45:14,690
I'm sorry. They have been working on how to use them so that you do you know home in on hey this is the one I don't use like that.

1386
02:45:16,760 --> 02:45:20,760
After that. And I know you've done that a lot for fragile family.

1387
02:45:22,550 --> 02:45:31,340
I bet you could. I heard I didn't hear the language.

1388
02:45:31,430 --> 02:45:39,100
That's right. But, yeah, we've been I'm happy to say that we're about the same stuff, too.

1389
02:45:41,130 --> 02:45:46,000
But thank you so. In that maxim, like talking to one.

1390
02:45:47,490 --> 02:45:55,850
About 3 minutes and 15. But even so, their expertize was used by the Internet data center.

1391
02:45:56,100 --> 02:45:58,549
At their cluster. That's pretty useful.

1392
02:45:58,550 --> 02:46:06,130
But then also like knowing this data sets and you're going to come in and be like all these variables behind with a different.

1393
02:46:11,220 --> 02:46:18,209
Also asking a doctoral student that we did a similar research because one of the things

1394
02:46:18,210 --> 02:46:24,050
I have learned a lot of people do is like what other scholars or databases we use.

1395
02:46:25,590 --> 02:46:33,540
But you can also, you know, you there's so many students that I think like 30 somethings carved out.

1396
02:46:37,390 --> 02:46:42,160
Sense of what databases they use. But I think a lot of people like the comparisons and like.

1397
02:46:43,370 --> 02:46:47,130
We want to help turn around and we don't know some of that.

1398
02:46:50,100 --> 02:47:00,070
There is that new data. Data stewardship. Initiatives like this that so many of us are requirement around data management is not.

1399
02:47:02,680 --> 02:47:08,650
Was nothing to do but. Anybody that's featured about that research, they need to.

1400
02:47:09,770 --> 02:47:16,820
Because of the ban on yoga has starting. And it's just kind of off.

1401
02:47:17,520 --> 02:47:24,900
In the past few months. The stewardship. So 2000 events were set before.

1402
02:47:47,830 --> 02:47:51,160
I just travel than I like to work part time.

1403
02:47:53,680 --> 02:47:59,320
I think I just have to take my training for the summer.

1404
02:48:00,640 --> 02:48:09,040
So, yeah, I enjoy myself. I feel like it was a really I had a rough first year, so I feel like I did it time and it was the best choice for me.

1405
02:48:09,490 --> 02:48:13,680
So yeah, I was a for my personal.

1406
02:48:15,530 --> 02:48:29,860
I kind of did research deserve that. So I think, you know, I think there is a there's also an understanding that we are in the summer.

1407
02:48:30,430 --> 02:48:33,680
I mean, you know, we did not specify that it was coming back.

1408
02:48:33,730 --> 02:48:37,550
Actually, there had to be. So that's something I have to.

1409
02:48:37,640 --> 02:48:43,360
I don't. The right. 1932.

1410
02:48:44,840 --> 02:48:56,530
I didn't. Our first American has a very.

1411
02:48:58,740 --> 02:49:12,010
I did write lot about. I'm. Favorite one that's not thinking about her because I've done it.

1412
02:49:12,010 --> 02:49:16,590
I'm taking seven men to right now, but I have to take everything based on that.

1413
02:49:16,990 --> 02:49:24,100
Are there any other key ones like that? The opportunity for quantitative and qualitative.

1414
02:49:24,190 --> 02:49:29,440
I'm interested in different methods and. Exactly. Working in the center in class for.

1415
02:49:32,630 --> 02:49:34,430
I don't think she's not taking it right now.

1416
02:49:34,430 --> 02:49:43,879
But I will say that I think the fact that we didn't expect that to happen in the because it seemed like when I took it,

1417
02:49:43,880 --> 02:49:48,230
I ran a hypothetical like minded study by other people in the past.

1418
02:49:48,230 --> 02:49:52,650
And the. He does everything to. Right about now.

1419
02:49:52,880 --> 02:49:59,630
Data So I think whether you take it down the line or whatever it is, I think it is going to prevent.

1420
02:50:04,510 --> 02:50:15,390
Yeah. Yeah.

1421
02:50:15,420 --> 02:50:21,989
About. Secondly, secondary data analysis, I think you have to remember,

1422
02:50:21,990 --> 02:50:29,370
I think I was sitting next to her at some meeting and it like, like popped up on Amazon, which was so cool.

1423
02:50:30,660 --> 02:50:34,020
But yet she's not really banned from the resource center right now.

1424
02:50:49,460 --> 02:50:54,930
But it's a good build up to that. Yeah.

1425
02:50:55,050 --> 02:51:07,810
I think we have a several. I have to say to you, I don't think anybody has he's ever going to here.

1426
02:51:08,630 --> 02:51:15,820
I'm doing it this semester. 857.

1427
02:51:17,940 --> 02:51:21,870
You know, but it's we're doing it as an independent study.

1428
02:51:22,860 --> 02:51:27,540
But the course, a textbook, is like a book that he developed himself.

1429
02:51:28,630 --> 02:51:37,690
Pretty much how do you use the different data set? And it goes back my step so I can see like is been writing about taxes that we use in the data.

1430
02:51:38,980 --> 02:51:49,210
We use the cancer registry, I know it's called, but I don't think it's an attitude in that you might have some of books that people.

1431
02:51:49,660 --> 02:51:56,360
To use those data sets you might want. You said it's embarrassing.

1432
02:51:56,510 --> 02:51:59,650
Yeah. Yeah.

1433
02:51:59,660 --> 02:52:12,860
It's really nice. I'm over here on things like this, you know?

1434
02:52:13,380 --> 02:52:27,620
I mean, I don't really see it. It's like this is really it's basically class in how to, like, manage large data, but so like some of the data type.

1435
02:52:28,100 --> 02:52:32,060
So, yeah, like a nice programing angle and stuff.

1436
02:52:32,540 --> 02:52:35,770
Wow. Wow. So, yeah, that's a bit later on.

1437
02:52:36,330 --> 02:52:44,590
Yeah. I mean, like to just pull off that is that that diffuse knowledge that is like out there that people like crying over work.

1438
02:52:46,460 --> 02:52:51,770
Yeah. Like you have like this data here or you'd like to do that myself.

1439
02:52:51,770 --> 02:53:01,530
How to do it. So. Yeah. It's nice that he does it and the class is nice accepted because it's more of a once you see the nursing and then something

1440
02:53:01,550 --> 02:53:09,740
you do you know and it's nice and informative because we meet for one hour a week and then the rest is like our opening time.

1441
02:53:09,740 --> 02:53:13,730
But, um. Yeah.

1442
02:53:14,140 --> 02:53:20,049
So what do I need to do? Things that I can tell you to use, but I feel like it's already useful for you.

1443
02:53:20,050 --> 02:53:23,340
This isn't for. Portrayed Grandma.

1444
02:53:26,380 --> 02:53:34,550
Oh, well, I think you guys are coming up on your third set, just like I said, selfishly, like fear to do anything, you know?

1445
02:53:34,890 --> 02:53:38,210
So, yeah, that's why we asked to come again.

1446
02:53:41,240 --> 02:53:46,490
But, uh. And.

1447
02:53:47,890 --> 02:53:51,750
The rest of the day. Done. And then.

1448
02:53:55,010 --> 02:54:03,390
Yeah. Yeah. Any time.

1449
02:54:09,310 --> 02:54:14,380
Oh, you guys. Christie.

1450
02:54:14,620 --> 02:54:18,280
This is a change. Christie's going to come in on November nine.

1451
02:54:19,450 --> 02:54:22,990
Instead of throwing your 26.

1452
02:54:24,000 --> 02:54:34,580
Look, we'll talk about the reason. And then we'll talk about the science of communication from time to time, because it has to.

1453
02:54:35,370 --> 02:54:42,770
So, you know, there's like there's some readings and stuff, but I'll I'll send out an announcement a little better to just look at the reading.

1454
02:54:44,450 --> 02:54:53,350
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Like I told her, I.

1455
02:54:55,740 --> 02:55:07,510
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1456
02:55:08,080 --> 02:55:11,140
It was like that sort of thing where you're.

1457
02:55:13,120 --> 02:55:20,320
This is very cool.

1458
02:55:20,800 --> 02:55:26,080
I have some questions for you.

1459
02:55:31,490 --> 02:55:34,820
I thought we had that.

1460
02:55:40,370 --> 02:55:44,870
Okay. There you go. Yeah. Look, I intend to do that.

1461
02:55:45,980 --> 02:55:50,020
You're exactly right. Yeah, yeah, I think.

1462
02:55:50,130 --> 02:55:54,410
I think they're evil. I know. Oh, yeah.

1463
02:55:54,920 --> 02:55:59,500
Oh, yeah. See, I really like. Yeah, I just knew that I was.

1464
02:56:03,530 --> 02:56:08,780
I think you so. How did that work out? I don't know what you're.

1465
02:56:10,790 --> 02:56:24,810
Yeah. I think I have an understanding that I mean, getting out of I alive, otherwise they're on the way.

1466
02:56:26,360 --> 02:56:31,760
I don't want to take that. Yeah.

1467
02:56:33,810 --> 02:56:40,590
You know, and so every time I go to love movies.

1468
02:56:42,290 --> 02:56:48,960
I never think of them like, Oh, I want to do that again.

1469
02:56:54,360 --> 02:56:57,570
I like all of them.

1470
02:56:59,850 --> 02:57:02,960
Every I think, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1471
02:57:04,820 --> 02:57:09,770
Every day. Right. Right. I am going to bed.

1472
02:57:10,490 --> 02:57:15,330
Very great. It's a great time. And I think it's.

1473
02:57:15,350 --> 02:57:24,320
I think classic. It's like in all the classic is what I thought, you know, everything went without a fight.

1474
02:57:24,590 --> 02:57:30,120
And I think that, you know, I mean, other than that, I like that, you know?

1475
02:57:30,150 --> 02:57:34,680
I think that's great.

1476
02:57:35,770 --> 02:57:42,380
Yeah. Right, exactly. I you feel like I have the guys.

1477
02:57:42,430 --> 02:57:45,630
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1478
02:57:45,790 --> 02:57:49,129
Like, I can't really. I don't know exactly what the hours are.

1479
02:57:49,130 --> 02:57:56,180
I'm really sorry. I don't know how to get better value than the titles, you know?

1480
02:57:57,980 --> 02:58:02,610
Yeah, see, I like that. I thought that was like, yeah.

1481
02:58:02,660 --> 02:58:14,850
So yeah, I did hear from time to time, I guess a couple more, but I think, oh yeah, yeah.

1482
02:58:15,530 --> 02:58:33,850
But yeah, I think, I think that, you know, like I, it's not literally you're not going to say yeah, yeah, yeah.

1483
02:58:34,730 --> 02:58:38,600
You know, yeah, I didn't know anything. Right. Yeah. You know, it's really dry.

1484
02:58:38,600 --> 02:58:48,700
And so they got like all parties and all sometimes even there and I to, you know, I don't know what we would have been,

1485
02:58:49,480 --> 02:58:56,880
you know, like end of the semester like really like thinking about and, you know, like after like.

1486
02:59:00,600 --> 02:59:07,300
Like for like early. And then they started running away from her.

1487
02:59:07,320 --> 02:59:21,030
And if I get punished, I want my family.

1488
02:59:21,100 --> 02:59:25,480
So you guys and I never hold our noses.

1489
02:59:26,110 --> 02:59:36,350
So she's still here on the playground, and I feel like the girl is doing this, though, like doing laundry.

1490
02:59:36,970 --> 02:59:40,690
You know, I mean, I have three kids, period, and they're coming up to three.

1491
02:59:40,690 --> 02:59:45,310
You know, it's like you're not still operating. She's operating and providing this care.

1492
02:59:45,930 --> 02:59:46,410
Yeah.

1493
02:59:46,480 --> 02:59:55,020
Then we started having a family who was like, Yeah, right now, like, we're, we're starting to talk about, especially if you're not doing it that day.

1494
02:59:55,030 --> 02:59:58,840
They're like also, you know, like, over.
