1
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:26,890
Hello, everyone. Good to see you all.

2
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:37,510
Hope you all had a good break last week. I'm having a little break from can you hear is that OK?

3
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:52,330
Sorry. OK, so hopefully everyone had a good break last week and the quiz is out of the way.

4
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:59,860
So we're starting a new sort of a new section this week.

5
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:04,990
So I want to do a we'll do a brief check in.

6
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:11,200
And then today we start we'll talk about population health. We're going to talk about social determinants of health.

7
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:18,550
We're going to do disparities in health over the next couple of weeks.

8
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:29,470
So let's start today just with a a bit of a check in what you're thinking about related to health health care,

9
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:37,680
since we haven't had a class in a while and I'm going to randomly call on people.

10
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:52,010
We'll start doing that for this session, this half of the semester, so I'm just going to have to bring a random number generator number.

11
00:01:52,010 --> 00:02:00,550
Are you here today, Neuffer? OK.

12
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:19,410
Um, let's see, you know, I'm going to the front of the alphabet or the back about Brayer.

13
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:24,950
I know a couple of people. Is that Breea? Yeah.

14
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:29,670
Oh, sorry, we're just doing the check in just so this is no pressure.

15
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:33,740
This is health health care you've been thinking about.

16
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:39,900
Did you read something in the paper, one of your classes, one of the things you're actually don't like about,

17
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:48,330
you know, we're going to talk about quality adjusted life years. Some people really, you know, any.

18
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:59,200
Thing related to health and health care, that's on your mind. OK.

19
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,500
Uh. It's not really detailed, but.

20
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:10,260
Yesterday, I ran into my yoga and she's she's in the pharmaceutical industry,

21
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:20,570
so we were talking briefly on what that entails and just kind of going over how pharmaceuticals kind of.

22
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:30,220
What developments they're working with in population health in just kind of like the interesting intersection of the pros and cons of that.

23
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:36,260
OK, so did you tell her everything you know about pharmaceutical pricing?

24
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:43,160
No, but I think one thing that well, now putting all her patients out, but she does work for Johnson and Johnson.

25
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,880
So that was something that was really interesting.

26
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:55,310
Just kind of getting a non biased view of what the hesitancy with the vaccine in like previous lawsuits and Johnson

27
00:03:55,310 --> 00:04:02,940
and Johnson and just how that works and maintaining and gaining the population's trust to support your product.

28
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:08,840
Yeah, yeah. Oh, that's interesting. I think I wonder how they're feeling with all of the like.

29
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:15,110
Oh, if you had a JNJ, you can now get a Pfizer or Moderna.

30
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:20,180
I don't know how Johnson and Johnson actually feels about that.

31
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:25,620
OK, so pharmaceutical industry. Awesome.

32
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:34,250
How about. Tiffany.

33
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:52,510
I. I was really thinking about how our mortality rate is so high.

34
00:04:52,510 --> 00:05:01,400
No, nothing going. Carol.

35
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:08,810
Yeah, so we've talked about spending, we looked at quality, and now we're going to look at some of these population health measures and it's

36
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:15,300
not really is what we usually think of in the US as being excellent health.

37
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:21,360
So we're going to get into detail on that. It's a little worrisome.

38
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:30,820
How about. Dounia.

39
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:38,660
I have heard a lot, and it was just.

40
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:42,920
And it was like an analysis about the response to Ebola and I was kind of thinking about

41
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:48,710
it in response to covid and obviously back then covid was not in anybody's mindset,

42
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:55,790
but kind of seeing the process of their response for a pandemic that was localized to such a small amount of countries.

43
00:05:55,790 --> 00:06:01,910
It can be thinking like, did they use that knowledge that they gained from that for their response with covid?

44
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:06,590
Was it even comparable with such a large difference in size?

45
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:11,060
Like it was just kind of I have to think about it because there's no obviously data on that yet.

46
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:19,900
But it was interesting to think about in that regard. Yeah, so did they did did we use things that we learned from Ebola?

47
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:23,690
Was that oh, did you haven't you haven't answered the question yet.

48
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:38,970
OK. I 94.

49
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:40,200
Yeah, smaller scale,

50
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:51,810
but actually probably also the location of where Ebola outbreaks were that usually countries like the US or the West Western Europe don't say,

51
00:06:51,810 --> 00:07:00,780
oh, let's look at response in countries in Africa, even though we probably could have learned a lot from that.

52
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:07,660
OK, one more. Let's do.

53
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:23,430
Ahmed. Well, I don't think there are two other.

54
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:31,140
So for a population health informatics, which I think we're going to talk about a little today,

55
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:41,790
I was kind of reading about the the VA and how even after the the recent pandemic and not that it's still not that it's over,

56
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:51,750
um, they were still having some interoperability issues and a lot of that was realized because of the pandemic.

57
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:56,580
So and even after all that, after the huge surge in telehealth visits,

58
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:03,330
they're still having issues like incorporating a lot of those interoperability standards.

59
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:10,390
I think of like a big issue so far as just overcoming a lot of data silos.

60
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:18,250
And stuff like that, yeah, the informatics challenge is covid brought that out even more.

61
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:24,910
The VA, I think you mentioned, is one of the most interoperable systems that we have in the country.

62
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:35,050
You know, if you go to a VA in Michigan and then you go to a VA in California, they will have your data and your in your in your record.

63
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:41,330
Whereas most other health systems, it doesn't matter if they all have the same medical record company,

64
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:49,520
epic, whatever, they don't necessarily talk to each other, even if they are in the same community or not.

65
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:56,680
And then the intersection between health care delivery and public health,

66
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:07,570
the informatics and interoperability there became really clear during covid that we did not have good systems in place for sharing that information.

67
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:18,400
So those kinds of issues are really important as we think about some of the challenges going forward in thinking about population health,

68
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:26,440
how do we think about systems and technology that might actually be already available but is just not implemented

69
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:34,880
in ways that make it really useful to either health care or public health because of the big gaps that exist?

70
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:40,630
OK. So.

71
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:47,470
Did I take that out, OK, what we're going to be doing today are talking about first just some of these population characteristics.

72
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:57,340
When we think about population health, right? We can talk about life expectancy and we know that life expectancy varies a lot.

73
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:04,000
We're going to be starting Thursday and next week digging in quite a bit into the US.

74
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,860
But today we'll just start by thinking about some of these at the global level.

75
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:18,160
So big variations in life expectancy. We've already talked about this a little bit when we compared health systems across developed countries.

76
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:27,850
So this is the whole world, Japan, Western Europe, Australia, Canada, with the highest life expectancy.

77
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:38,710
And what does that? Also, Chile, the US and some other developed countries also have pretty high life expectancies.

78
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:47,100
And then we have large parts of Africa which with much lower overall life expectancy.

79
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:52,830
We also know that the world is aging rapidly. We've talked about this already, too.

80
00:10:52,830 --> 00:11:06,180
We know that, for example, in industrialized countries, rapid aging is happening, but it's also happening in less developed countries.

81
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:11,930
Those countries are also rapidly aging.

82
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:20,570
And when we think about things like population health and thinking about why how these are related,

83
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:28,010
right, as life expectancy increases, the population will age.

84
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:28,490
Right,

85
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:42,840
there's two things are connected and so thinking about what that means for all kinds of implications for public health and health care delivery.

86
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:49,320
But it's also true that people are having fewer children everywhere in the world,

87
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:59,460
and that's also going to be related to an aging society as you have fewer children being born.

88
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:06,180
No other change. You're going to have an aging society, right.

89
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:15,660
And so we have both things going on. We have life expectancy is increasing and children and fewer children are being born.

90
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:23,580
And that's going to mean those two things connected that we've got a higher median age across the world.

91
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:28,200
And you guys, are you taking AP right now?

92
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:33,120
No. Bias starts next semester or next, but you'll learn the curves, right?

93
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,440
So for much of human history, I usually put one of these in.

94
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:49,680
If we look at it's sort of a pyramid, if this is age categories, you know, zero through five, six to 15.

95
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:57,900
Sixteen to twenty five, right, you've got more people being born for much of human history,

96
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:03,480
the death rate for people aged zero to five was extremely high.

97
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:15,140
And so at each age, you are losing people. Well, today, this looks a lot more like.

98
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:26,770
Like that. Because and in fact, they are thinking by twenty two thousand one hundred, it's actually going to start to do that.

99
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:33,400
We have many fewer people being born and more people surviving.

100
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:47,320
So thinking about the implications of those global health changes in the population have implications for all of us.

101
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,860
Other population health measures, right,

102
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:57,340
we often don't just talk about life expectancy and the age of the population and the health of the population,

103
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:03,640
we talk about death rates and that's kind of what we're going to look at today.

104
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:08,620
Don't try to really just take a minute to take this in.

105
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:13,000
It's not for you to to have to know.

106
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:22,450
But I thought it was kind of a cool way of displaying the causes of death across the world.

107
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:29,830
So we have the 20 richest countries of the world and we have the 20 poorest countries of the world.

108
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:35,970
And starting from the inside, you have the leading causes of death.

109
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:47,070
Across the world and in some ways, what you can just see without even being able to read it is that there are some real similarities,

110
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:53,650
whether it's the richest countries or the poorest countries, some of the causes of death are the same.

111
00:14:53,650 --> 00:15:06,160
But also, there are some real differences, so in the the high income countries of the world, heart disease is number one.

112
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:13,330
We've got stroke, lung disease, lung cancer in there.

113
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:23,550
When we look at the poorest, we also have heart disease, stroke, lung disease.

114
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:31,500
But in the poorest countries, we've got diarrheal diseases, we've got neonatal death,

115
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:39,210
HIV AIDS, respiratory infection, respiratory infection as a leading cause of death.

116
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:47,760
These are all deaths for. A birth to age five.

117
00:15:47,760 --> 00:16:00,540
Leading causes of that previous model of young children being the most at risk of death,

118
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:11,250
that's no longer the case in much of the world and certainly in the developed world, in the many of these countries.

119
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:14,520
But what what makes it into the top 10 and this is, of course,

120
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:26,100
pretty covid is self-harm is in the top 10 leading causes of death in the US and other developed countries.

121
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:38,770
Suicide, sometimes opioid use and other high risk behaviors are in that category.

122
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:47,140
So just thinking about the causes of death and how those are distributed across the population is something

123
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:57,940
important to be considering as we talk about public health measures and medical care and health care systems,

124
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:09,080
what do those need to look like when you've got this kind of very different distributions of disease and death?

125
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:21,230
In the US pre covid, these are the leading causes of death as sort of we just saw accidents, suicide.

126
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:32,930
We have a couple of infectious diseases. Influenza is up there, but not compared to developing countries.

127
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:45,830
And then, of course, this is what covid looks like. So, you know, covid appears and becomes the third leading cause of death.

128
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:55,550
For a few months, then goes down, well, it's still the third leading cause of death for most of the last for twenty,

129
00:17:55,550 --> 00:18:01,280
twenty, twenty, twenty one becomes the leading cause of death for a while.

130
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:06,830
And now in the late summer, kind of came down.

131
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:13,220
And this latest surge, which we are coming off again, back up to number three.

132
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:22,700
So the waning of covid, I think that we are starting to feel and think about as we see the curves going down,

133
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:37,640
say, in the US, it's still in the top 10, in the top five leading causes of death in the US.

134
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:52,690
But let's now take a step back. And think about mortality rates, death rates earlier in the 20th century, pre 20th and, you know,

135
00:18:52,690 --> 00:19:03,550
nineteen hundred to nineteen seventy, so death rates came down pretty dramatically in the first part of the 20th century.

136
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:14,950
You can see here the decline for both men and women. Oftentimes, we will look at mortality rates by differentiated by male and female.

137
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:32,860
We can also think about differentiating them, adjusting them for age and other characteristics that we'll talk about.

138
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:42,130
Mortality was really declining. These are the causes of death.

139
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:50,440
Mortality is declining among major infectious disease over the 20th century in that first part of the 20th century.

140
00:19:50,440 --> 00:20:03,160
That's really what was reduced. That means that those younger age children are going to be more likely to survive.

141
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:08,290
That's going to immediately contribute to an aging society.

142
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:12,460
More people, more children living past the age of five.

143
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:20,840
But of course, you can see what then happens. Diseases of aging begin to increase.

144
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:27,440
So more people are surviving infectious disease or not even having infectious disease.

145
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:32,570
More children are surviving to live into older ages.

146
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:41,330
And then when people live longer, then we've got chronic conditions that start to be leading causes of deaths.

147
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:46,950
And you can see accidents don't really change very much.

148
00:20:46,950 --> 00:21:00,310
OK, so now. Just going to think a little bit about.

149
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:12,060
Where is my. A little poll here.

150
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:20,820
What is the most important factor affecting that change, that rapid decline in mortality,

151
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:28,530
particularly in infectious diseases that happened in the early part of the 20th century?

152
00:21:28,530 --> 00:23:00,470
Or across the 20th century. What do you think?

153
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:07,150
And just before we look at the results there. I think the Saltierra.

154
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:59,580
But. This is the second most. Maybe I should go back.

155
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:08,040
All right, let's look at the results. What do people think for?

156
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:16,530
Well, pretty clear to people or two thirds of people think clean water and sanitation and then

157
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:27,270
about a third medical treatment and a few people think maybe a few other food supply,

158
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:34,680
industrial revolution. How about for our number two?

159
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:48,240
OK, so here we've got still lots of people think it's improved sanitation, but majority, almost half, I guess you're split pretty evenly.

160
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,960
Half think it's medical treatments, right.

161
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:57,120
So why who is thinking medical treatment for number one and or No.

162
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:02,790
Two? Why what what is the reason to think it's medical treatment?

163
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:20,640
For what you now know about, OK, there's a decline. OK, so vaccines are developed in this period in the early 20th century,

164
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:31,920
and so that's likely the case because these are infectious diseases and we know vaccines help prevent infectious disease.

165
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:45,350
That makes sense. But we're actually going to see why that is not actually correct, but it is a very reasonable.

166
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:49,910
You know, a reasonable way to think so,

167
00:25:49,910 --> 00:26:03,440
there are generally three factors that have affected the decline in mortality in the 20th century and the primary number one factor is one,

168
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:13,160
almost nobody selected. Consistent food supply.

169
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:20,040
Consistent amount of calories.

170
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:28,270
To sustain. Your life and well-being.

171
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:40,000
And it's summed up in this quote by McEwan, who is an epidemiologist and in nineteen seventy six,

172
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:53,050
so health improved not because of what we did when people got sick, but because having enough calories prevents you from getting sick.

173
00:26:53,050 --> 00:27:03,370
So a lot of that infectious disease is because of a lack of enough calories.

174
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:16,540
To maintain health, which is why we still see high levels of infectious disease killing children under the age of five in poor countries,

175
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:26,490
where it's partly a lack of not having enough food to fight off infection.

176
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:37,140
Before you get it. The second factor.

177
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:47,280
After that consistent food supply. And sometimes people will say it's good nutrition, like the way we think now about a healthy diet.

178
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:52,260
So it's a healthy diet because it's enough calories to eat.

179
00:27:52,260 --> 00:28:02,010
So keep that in mind. It's not about the composition of the diet, like, oh, I eat more fresh fruits and vegetables compared to fatty foods.

180
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:09,120
That's that's a twenty first century, a late 20th century need for us.

181
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:14,450
But just having enough calories, is that is that really what this is about?

182
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:19,080
The second one, the second factor are those public health measures.

183
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:25,320
So lots of you chose that for the first or certainly the second.

184
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:33,730
So clean water is a huge factor.

185
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:40,960
So you have enough calories to help fight off infection and having access to clean water means you're,

186
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:50,410
again, not going to face lots and lots of infectious things trying to kill you.

187
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:59,160
Sanitation and sewage and then sort of the quality of housing, which means having housing.

188
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:09,060
At all in some way is a big factor, but then having that not be so crowded, overcrowded,

189
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:20,550
having somewhat of enough space, having the sewage, not living next to a sewage open,

190
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:30,390
open sewage, not certainly not getting your drinking or cleaning water from that kind of a water source,

191
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:35,490
all of those things had another big impact on the decline.

192
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:44,420
And what's the second factor? And then third, we get to the medical treatments, vaccines, certainly,

193
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:55,880
and then other major pharmaceutical innovations like antibiotics are all come about in the early 20th century.

194
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:04,130
So these are these slides are from McEwen's book and they're a little fuzzy, but you can see.

195
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:10,730
So these are some major infectious diseases, TB, measles, scarlet fever, typhoid.

196
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:18,470
And it shows their mortality rate and how it was declining over this period prior

197
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:29,500
to the antibiotic that was developed to actually treat that infectious disease.

198
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:43,060
So that the antibiotics coming about certainly contributed to lowering the mortality rate from tuberculosis,

199
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:52,300
but it was after a huge decline had already occurred because of factors one and two.

200
00:30:52,300 --> 00:31:07,560
Consistent food supply, public health, sanitation measures around water, sanitation, sewage, and then these innovations are certainly very important.

201
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:16,490
Here we have more of the vaccines and the antibiotics.

202
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:25,750
So all really important. And had a significant, measurable effect on the mortality rate,

203
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:38,260
but the biggest declines happened before these medical treatments were available and that were not it were responsible for the big decline.

204
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:43,230
And mortality is those first two factors.

205
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:55,350
And in fact, this slide puts together how we can think about declining mortality rates with increased medical care, medical treatment.

206
00:31:55,350 --> 00:32:07,050
So we've got, again, the mortality declines from the dotted line as infectious disease and overall mortality and this sort of jagged line here,

207
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:20,020
percent spending on medical care. And spending on medical care goes up, mortality continues to decline.

208
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:30,280
So there's a relationship there, an important one, but this slide in part helps us remember and sort of reset.

209
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:37,840
Why, thinking about public health? And medical care, first of all, go together.

210
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:49,230
Importantly, but public health. Has can have a a dramatic effect on population health measures like mortality

211
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:57,990
and overall population as we think about the percent GDP on medical care.

212
00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:06,460
What do we what do we know what's happening here? Nineteen thirty to nineteen forty.

213
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:19,720
Nineteen forty to nineteen fifty. 60, what's responsible for these changes?

214
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:27,970
First, Blue Cross Blue Shield, the invention, right, and then we start to see measures of before nineteen twenty eight,

215
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:38,070
we don't even it's not even on the map really when we see it go up again in the 40s.

216
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:48,140
What is it? It's World War Two, you know, so remember that.

217
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:56,120
So it is that is partly what they're spending it on. But remember World War Two and the accidental system.

218
00:33:56,120 --> 00:34:08,720
Right, that companies were starting to do employer sponsored insurance, so we had lots of big investments in health care and medical care.

219
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:17,210
Before that, it was out of pocket and you waited until you were really sick to go to the hospital.

220
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:28,710
And then sixty five. We see a big jump in percent GDP on medical care, and that is.

221
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:43,080
Medicare and Medicaid, yes. OK, so when we think about comparing and the contributions of public health and medical care,

222
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:49,950
medical treatment, there's really a very different kind of approach to thinking about health.

223
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:57,770
They're both important, but very different. So medicine, medical care,

224
00:34:57,770 --> 00:35:09,080
health care says why does this patient have this set of symptoms at this time and

225
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:15,590
what what what is it and what's the best treatment to help end those symptoms,

226
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:25,760
potentially cure the disease and the ailment? And to some extent, how can it be prevented in the future?

227
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:37,490
This set of symptoms for this patient. And maybe patients similar to this patient.

228
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:51,660
So. Sorry, I'm not sure why that's in there, the emphasis here is on this patient medicine and medical treatment is focused on individuals.

229
00:35:51,660 --> 00:36:04,480
With symptoms, with disease. In order to help cure it, overcome it, manage it.

230
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:11,200
So and we talked about a little bit about the difference between and so we're going to talk about those primary prevention,

231
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:19,330
secondary prevention and tertiary prevention. So medicine is one aspect of medicine over.

232
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:25,600
So treatment, diagnosis and treatment is a big part of medical care.

233
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:31,740
And the future looking is about what's called secondary prevention.

234
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:40,590
Who else might be high risk for this set of symptoms, for this disease, for this illness?

235
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:48,090
That might include the individual patient who was just treated because you've had it once, you might be at high risk in the future.

236
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:53,970
So we're going to think about you and others like you who might have some high risk.

237
00:36:53,970 --> 00:37:03,650
So how might we identify and screen people who might be high risk?

238
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:11,290
And then we'll try to detect that and deliver treatment in order to.

239
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:23,770
Prevent it from getting worse, maybe prevent it from occurring at all primary or secondary prevention and then what's called tertiary

240
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:33,280
prevention is helping people who have a disease or illness or disability to manage it over time.

241
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,910
So we can't cure it, we can identify it.

242
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:44,950
We can help manage it. So chronic disease treatment of chronic disease.

243
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:55,570
So what's going to help reduce the symptoms, reduce the negative impact of that disease on your life, to improve your quality of life?

244
00:37:55,570 --> 00:38:07,120
That's tertiary prevention. And medicine, of course, does this really well.

245
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:14,790
In contrast, look at public health, so public health is also asking questions.

246
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:23,780
What are the levels and patterns of disease? What are the trends and disease in the population?

247
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:30,890
So not for individuals suffering from it, but across the population.

248
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:39,190
Why do we see these patterns in the population? How can it be prevented?

249
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:47,530
And how can health be promoted across the population?

250
00:38:47,530 --> 00:39:01,580
So public health looks at rates of events, mortality rates, leading causes of death, life expectancy, all some of those things we just looked at.

251
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:09,900
Also, we talk about incidence rates. The number of new cases.

252
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:16,530
Of a disease or illness in a population in some period of time.

253
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:29,610
And prevalence rates. The total number of cases with that disease or those symptoms in a population.

254
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:39,240
Total, so not over, not in a period of time, and not just the new cases, all of the cases.

255
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:47,080
So why why these two rates? Why do we want to have an incidence rate?

256
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:52,780
What what diseases might it be important to have and talk about incidence?

257
00:39:52,780 --> 00:40:02,780
Versus prevalence. And this should be an easy one, and I think.

258
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:17,860
Maybe given that we're in in a pandemic. OK, so four incidents, things that are more infectious.

259
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:22,810
That you want to see new cases, is that increasing or decreasing?

260
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:31,240
We're looking at the we're looking at incidence rates for coronavirus every day in the paper.

261
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:39,760
We've been talking about these every day for almost two years. What are the new occurrences and are they going up or are they going down?

262
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:51,050
Because that's telling us about the spread of this highly infectious and deadly disease, so we want to know about new cases.

263
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:56,810
But for chronic diseases and sometimes for things that are both infectious and chronic,

264
00:40:56,810 --> 00:41:05,240
so something like HIV AIDS, we want to talk we're going to talk about incidents as well as prevalence,

265
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:15,980
in part because we have a long term treatment now for something like HIV, but we're still worried about the new cases that continue to occur.

266
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:22,190
But for things like heart disease and diabetes and asthma.

267
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:32,150
We're often looking at prevalence rates because we're looking at how many people in the population are affected by that.

268
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:39,690
But even for those diseases, we want to think about incidents, given that we want to think about causes.

269
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:53,930
And why you might see higher incidence, new cases and likely then also higher prevalence in certain places or certain areas than others.

270
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:59,960
That's going to help us think about causes. Right.

271
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:03,710
That's going to help us think about how they are distributed across the

272
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:18,730
population and do we see disparities across groups in incidence and prevalence?

273
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:27,040
We're going to know this is going to lead to then identifying the factors associated, not at the individual level,

274
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:39,550
not what are the genetic and individual biological causes that might be affecting disease,

275
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:53,120
what medical care is focused on, but what are the factors that might be contributing to these patterns across the population?

276
00:42:53,120 --> 00:43:01,650
And for the third, public health is focused on primary prevention.

277
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:08,880
How to avert the occurrence of the disease. At all.

278
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:21,770
In the population. So not how to treat it once it's there, how to potentially limit it.

279
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:33,580
We're limited to negative, negative impact on the individuals who suffer from the disease, but prevent it in the first place.

280
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:43,920
And of course, all of these are necessary and important for thinking about health, population, health.

281
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:52,380
So American Public Health Association, right, public health is promoting and protecting health in communities,

282
00:43:52,380 --> 00:44:06,390
it's a population focus versus an individual focus of medical care and medical treatment.

283
00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:20,220
Anybody have questions or comments? So.

284
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:55,090
Hmm, I highly recommend. Population Health Program.

285
00:44:55,090 --> 00:45:01,990
Well, so the we're going to be we're going to be talking about that over the next three weeks or so,

286
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:09,220
social determinants of health and population health. And Paula is an expert in social determinants of health.

287
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:16,870
She's demographer. Demographers have been talking about social determinants of health for 50 years.

288
00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:27,340
Medical care has now started to understand that social determinants of health matter.

289
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:31,840
But we're going to we're going to kind of get to that in a few minutes and then through the

290
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:38,860
rest of the couple of weeks when we come back to that upstream downstream set of issues,

291
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:49,060
which is what Lance is talking about in that piece, where do we invest dollars if we're thinking about these issues?

292
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:54,730
Is it in the downstream medical treatment of cases?

293
00:45:54,730 --> 00:46:02,160
And the pros and cons and risks and costs and trade offs of that.

294
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:13,890
Or investing more upstream in population health measures that affect more of the population.

295
00:46:13,890 --> 00:46:19,830
So that's exactly the theme that we're going to be talking about.

296
00:46:19,830 --> 00:46:31,740
Starting today and over the next three weeks, really, what are the risks and benefits, what are the trade offs?

297
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:44,770
What is what is it that the US has been doing? I don't your question about like Michigan medicine, are you talking about the population health?

298
00:46:44,770 --> 00:46:52,200
Oh, yeah. So right. Epidemiologists, of course, like demographers, have been talking about population health.

299
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:59,920
They are the those are the fields out of which population health.

300
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:10,180
Was created, so public schools of public health are where are where epidemiologists have been talking about population health all along.

301
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:16,900
And of course, Paula, Lance was in the School of Public Health for a long time as well.

302
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:24,580
And the work is both public health, health policy and public policy overlapping.

303
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:28,120
There's a whole different argument that she's making in that paper, too,

304
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:36,100
about population health that's done within medical system, within health care systems.

305
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:49,790
And we've talked a little bit about that with payment models. Value based payment models are typically around defining a population of patients.

306
00:47:49,790 --> 00:48:05,520
Right, when we remember value based payments, alternative payment models, ACOs that that we just looked at, those are defined around a population.

307
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:20,050
Of patients. That is a very different focus, and that's what Paula Lance is criticizing in that article, is how health systems.

308
00:48:20,050 --> 00:48:27,690
Focusing on social determinants of health for a population of patients.

309
00:48:27,690 --> 00:48:43,650
It's not that that's a bad thing, but to the extent that that focus shifts funds that might be invested upstream in actual population, public health.

310
00:48:43,650 --> 00:48:50,940
Is concerning is a problem, so that's really what she's talking about in that piece,

311
00:48:50,940 --> 00:49:01,970
and we'll we'll come back to this at the end of this lecture in a few minutes and then also throughout the over the next couple of weeks.

312
00:49:01,970 --> 00:49:14,450
I'm going to come back to that slide, but just there are real advantages for medical that the approach of medicine focused on individual cases.

313
00:49:14,450 --> 00:49:20,370
It's appropriate. Somebody is sick. They have. They have.

314
00:49:20,370 --> 00:49:29,270
You know, symptoms, they have maybe something debilitating. Diagnosing and treating that is extremely important.

315
00:49:29,270 --> 00:49:36,830
The patient, the subject is very motivated. The provider is very motivated also by all of that.

316
00:49:36,830 --> 00:49:48,500
We know about how payment works, but certainly to help cure and and address the health needs of patients, it can be very measurable.

317
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:52,700
Right. We can clearly identify here's a sick person.

318
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:59,520
Here is a treatment. Did they get better? How much did it cost to treat them?

319
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:14,300
That's calculable. And easily understood by people in a in a risk sort of cost benefit analysis.

320
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:25,970
And it's certainly beneficial at the individual level. Some of the disadvantages, of course, are when we start to think about secondary prevention.

321
00:50:25,970 --> 00:50:45,640
Screening can be very costly. And it's not always necessarily contributing to big reductions in mortality or big increases in health for the expense.

322
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:56,170
But we because the first part is so measurable, we want to keep increasing investments in screening, when people talk about prevention,

323
00:50:56,170 --> 00:51:06,570
they're often talking about secondary prevention and preventive care is secondary and tertiary prevention.

324
00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:17,760
That's important, but it is not the same as preventing disease and illness in the first place in population health.

325
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:27,840
So it's actually it's limited prevention. It's preventing individuals from getting sick or getting sicker.

326
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:36,990
But it's not the same as that primary prevention to me, it was always very confusing that we call treatment of chronic disease.

327
00:51:36,990 --> 00:51:49,110
Tertiary prevention, like it's not prevention, it's preventing the decline, the further decline of a person with that disease.

328
00:51:49,110 --> 00:51:58,680
But to me, that's always been kind of confusing, so really beneficial for individuals who are at high risk or have the disease,

329
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:04,850
but not so much for population health necessarily overall.

330
00:52:04,850 --> 00:52:11,420
Public health, it's addressing multiple causes.

331
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:19,910
When you improve sanitation and clean, you provide clean water, you aren't just affecting affect infectious disease.

332
00:52:19,910 --> 00:52:33,460
Certainly you are multiple infectious diseases, but also lots of other factors, lots of other causes of disease in that.

333
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:40,660
Think about masks, right, we're wearing masks because we're worried about coronavirus,

334
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:51,820
but we're also preventing spread of influenza and other kinds of more minor infectious respiratory infections.

335
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:57,490
So it's preventing often multiple causes of disease. It's radical prevention.

336
00:52:57,490 --> 00:53:06,550
It's primary prevention. People people are living longer because they're not getting sick to begin with.

337
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:14,200
Right. Which is very different from your sick. We now have treatment for you.

338
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:25,050
And so the potential benefit for the population is pretty huge.

339
00:53:25,050 --> 00:53:32,640
Disadvantages of population health.

340
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:41,670
Certainly, if you've already got the disease, preventing the disease in the population is not going to be as motivating, right?

341
00:53:41,670 --> 00:53:53,160
You still need the medical treatment. The the so there's lower motivation for participation in some ways.

342
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:59,820
Think about all the resistance to things like masks and vaccines and other kinds of measures.

343
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:03,760
I'm not sick. I'm not worried about getting sick.

344
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:09,010
Why do I have to wear a mask if I'm sick?

345
00:54:09,010 --> 00:54:19,900
The motivation to engage in a treatment or an activity is there that it's much higher for public health, it's much lower.

346
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:30,830
And this is a real challenge for public health. All of the focus and the main action is outside of health care.

347
00:54:30,830 --> 00:54:39,110
So in some ways, that's a disadvantage because we have a whole system that's set up to deliver health

348
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:46,460
actually to to prevent and treat sickness right as we've built the health system.

349
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:50,450
But but it's a big infrastructure that exists.

350
00:54:50,450 --> 00:55:03,690
So the fact that public health is outside of health care delivery in some ways is an advantage, a disadvantage, because we we don't.

351
00:55:03,690 --> 00:55:09,610
We don't have that infrastructure, we can't call on all the expertize.

352
00:55:09,610 --> 00:55:17,500
And that's some of the argument that that Lance is actually arguing against, she's saying that's why people are saying, hey,

353
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:24,100
social determinants of health, let's bring that into the health care system, because we've got this whole infrastructure.

354
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:31,130
We're already focused on people's health. We should be the ones to address.

355
00:55:31,130 --> 00:55:33,440
Health.

356
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:44,600
So why don't we do that in the medical care system and Lance and others are saying, Will, because medicine is set up to focus on the individual.

357
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:55,130
Not on the population. So in some ways, I think the fact that the main action is outside of health care means that could be an advantage,

358
00:55:55,130 --> 00:56:08,380
but it's often seen as a disadvantage. Medicine has that really clear measures of sick person got the treatment, did they get better or not?

359
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:12,070
How much did it cost? Was that effective?

360
00:56:12,070 --> 00:56:21,430
Clear ways of measuring and calculating and comparing across treatment, investments and public health are less clear.

361
00:56:21,430 --> 00:56:26,530
And it's partly because of what we said as one of the advantages.

362
00:56:26,530 --> 00:56:30,640
It's partly because it's affecting many things.

363
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:36,250
You improve the air quality or the water quality.

364
00:56:36,250 --> 00:56:41,950
There used to be a saying, I think people still say it, but good public health is invisible.

365
00:56:41,950 --> 00:56:48,670
How are you going to count the diseases that don't happen? How do you count the infections that don't happen?

366
00:56:48,670 --> 00:57:02,380
So it's much harder to calculate the the benefits and the risks and show that as a clear, measurable outcome.

367
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:06,460
And that makes it hard to think about investing in public health.

368
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:14,740
So think about some of the, you know, public health investments.

369
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:31,030
You know, over 50 years ago, starting to really target smoking as a major contributor to mortality, to disease in society and how to go about that.

370
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:40,450
So all of those policy changes, all of those packaging changes, all of the restrictions around who can buy and where you can smoke.

371
00:57:40,450 --> 00:57:46,000
I grew up, you know, people smoked inside places, bars and restaurants.

372
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:51,670
And, you know, it was awful.

373
00:57:51,670 --> 00:58:02,910
But all of those investments in public health. Have led to lower and declining rates in lung cancer and lots of other kinds of diseases.

374
00:58:02,910 --> 00:58:14,850
But so we're kind of some people say like, well, talking about taxing soda or high sugar drinks is just like talking about smoking.

375
00:58:14,850 --> 00:58:18,540
Fifty years ago, we should we should tax those.

376
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:26,290
We should limit the size of those drinks. We should limit where they're sold, all of those kinds of things.

377
00:58:26,290 --> 00:58:39,370
Does it feel the same to you? This is thinking about sugary drinks feel the same as talking about smoking.

378
00:58:39,370 --> 00:58:51,390
Doesn't really to me, it doesn't seem because because now it's so clear and the benefits of limiting smoking are so clear.

379
00:58:51,390 --> 00:59:12,770
But in the beginning, it wasn't so clear and clear, lots of political resistance, Tomas.

380
00:59:12,770 --> 00:59:19,270
And that's the restrict that's the worry about it that you're saying that's why people are against it.

381
00:59:19,270 --> 00:59:31,420
Yeah, lots of reasons to be to be against it, and when it's like, look, it's not harming me, I'm fine.

382
00:59:31,420 --> 00:59:33,730
It's the same we're hearing around masks.

383
00:59:33,730 --> 00:59:44,780
So these arguments and the investments in the public health side of things, and I'm not arguing whether taxing soda is a good thing or not.

384
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:50,140
There's lots of good literature and argument out there for you to take a look at.

385
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:58,780
But it's a much harder case to make than increasing a dollar on a new treatment

386
00:59:58,780 --> 01:00:06,950
for diabetes versus increasing a dollar into a public health investment.

387
01:00:06,950 --> 01:00:20,780
That's typically the way we think about it. Lauren?

388
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:33,980
Firepower now used by.

389
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:40,160
So there are lots of different ways of coming coming at it, and public health has done many of those.

390
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:49,310
So there's the labels. Think about the labels on cigarets, then think about education campaigns,

391
01:00:49,310 --> 01:01:00,990
about healthy eating, similar to education campaigns against smoking, for example.

392
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:10,080
There are so many policy recommendations, right, that you could think about.

393
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:17,100
Exactly, so all of those things to think about for nutrition, which might not be about soda alone,

394
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:32,190
but might be in general about healthy eating or sugar or food preservatives, chemicals in in the food supply.

395
01:01:32,190 --> 01:01:41,420
To do something about them requires action at all of those different levels, and which is exactly what happened with smoking.

396
01:01:41,420 --> 01:01:58,100
Restrictions on where it was sold, how it was sold, pricing, education, labeling, et cetera, et cetera, it's not ever going to be one simple remedy.

397
01:01:58,100 --> 01:02:04,660
To work for these public health efforts. Wearing seatbelts.

398
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:15,250
Wearing helmets, those are public health measures and steps as well that have lots of different ways of approaching them,

399
01:02:15,250 --> 01:02:24,370
but the disadvantage is the challenge of making those political policy arguments.

400
01:02:24,370 --> 01:02:31,600
And to get investments in public health is harder than for medical treatment,

401
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:38,890
because it's first of all, it's already individualized into the health care system.

402
01:02:38,890 --> 01:02:45,880
When your doctor says here's a new treatment for this condition or we've screened

403
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:51,610
you and think you might be high risk and we've got a treatment available,

404
01:02:51,610 --> 01:02:57,020
that next dollar flows in to that treatment.

405
01:02:57,020 --> 01:03:02,270
It doesn't happen that way, there isn't an infrastructure set up.

406
01:03:02,270 --> 01:03:11,090
We do have an infrastructure. We have not invested in that infrastructure in the same way for public health as we have for health care.

407
01:03:11,090 --> 01:03:17,330
But I'm going to show you some interventions just to show some of the.

408
01:03:17,330 --> 01:03:24,380
And of course, yes, I have cherry picked these. This is not a random sample,

409
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:36,620
but it is to demonstrate that there are some public health measures that are that are both sort of public health and more public policy,

410
01:03:36,620 --> 01:03:42,030
public health policy that are so effective.

411
01:03:42,030 --> 01:03:53,200
That they actually have more benefits than costs for every dollar invested in those interventions.

412
01:03:53,200 --> 01:04:05,680
You get more health and more savings because you you have someone who doesn't need medical care and doesn't get sick investing in children.

413
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:07,480
Remember, we talked about this before.

414
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:20,020
Children are cheap and when we're in part trying to measure effectiveness by quality adjusted life years, which has a whole conversation about it.

415
01:04:20,020 --> 01:04:35,200
But for now, Will, we'll just accept it when you save and improve the life of a child who goes on to live a healthy, productive life.

416
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:48,210
That's a lot of quality adjusted life years. Right, and so prenatal care, childhood immunizations, even flu vaccines for not just children,

417
01:04:48,210 --> 01:04:59,190
but everybody investments in the food for women, infants and children who are low income.

418
01:04:59,190 --> 01:05:06,990
Have such a major return that every dollar invested for for which it's something like

419
01:05:06,990 --> 01:05:14,790
over three dollars you could expect in value from that one dollar of investment,

420
01:05:14,790 --> 01:05:27,440
and that's compared to some other treatments that we certainly think are really important medical treatments like coronary artery surgery.

421
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:39,950
To help improve reduce heart disease, extend the life people live, on average of about five years after a cabbage surgery,

422
01:05:39,950 --> 01:05:48,650
and of course, that varies a lot between on the age, the level of illness, other comorbidities.

423
01:05:48,650 --> 01:05:56,240
But doing that surgery compared to medical treatment.

424
01:05:56,240 --> 01:06:05,180
Treating the with with medication. Costs about ninety two thousand dollars.

425
01:06:05,180 --> 01:06:12,200
Per quality adjusted life year.

426
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:28,040
So those things are expensive, those investments are happening all the time because of all of those advantages in the approach of medical care.

427
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:41,730
I'm not saying those aren't good investments, but we're we argue a lot about whether we should expand these investments, which have such a clear.

428
01:06:41,730 --> 01:06:46,980
Benefit, and it's partly because of the approach and the advantages,

429
01:06:46,980 --> 01:06:53,970
but the disadvantages of public health and the way we have set up our public health infrastructure.

430
01:06:53,970 --> 01:07:10,410
In the US in particular. So if you remember this slide, when we think about health and health care and we talk about downstream.

431
01:07:10,410 --> 01:07:17,280
So investments in health care and screening.

432
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:27,910
And secondary and tertiary prevention are all here downstream focused on individuals who are already sick.

433
01:07:27,910 --> 01:07:50,580
Or who are at high risk of being sick, moving upstream and investing up here in changing care aspects of the environment in which we live and work.

434
01:07:50,580 --> 01:08:04,360
Those investments are the primary prevention, the public health approach is up here.

435
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:13,600
And most of us want to do all of those things, but there are real difficulties in the investments.

436
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:21,820
So this is another classic public health model, the health impact pyramid.

437
01:08:21,820 --> 01:08:31,660
So you get socioeconomic factors on the bottom, then you have changing the context for individuals decision making.

438
01:08:31,660 --> 01:08:39,940
Do they smoke or not? Right, when I was a kid, there was a lot less emphasis, it was clear that smoking was bad,

439
01:08:39,940 --> 01:08:48,370
but you could buy cigarets, even anybody could you could smoke them anywhere today.

440
01:08:48,370 --> 01:08:56,110
That's much less the case. Long lasting protective interventions,

441
01:08:56,110 --> 01:09:05,500
medical interventions like vaccines and medication than clinical interventions and all the way up to counseling.

442
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:10,900
And what this is showing is how much individual effort is needed.

443
01:09:10,900 --> 01:09:20,950
But it's also that the individual focus, right, this is population focused, that's individual focused.

444
01:09:20,950 --> 01:09:25,690
The impact is increasing in the other way.

445
01:09:25,690 --> 01:09:30,100
Right. Medical treatment is focusing on those individuals.

446
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:40,360
Population health is focusing on the population. If you think about if you want to think about this as upstream, downstream, you turn this on.

447
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:52,130
It's on its side. The socioeconomic factors are upstream, what are the investments there?

448
01:09:52,130 --> 01:09:59,650
Versus the investments downstream.

449
01:09:59,650 --> 01:10:13,910
And what we do when we talk about health in the US is this is where we talk about it, so we continue to invest down here.

450
01:10:13,910 --> 01:10:22,840
So even now, we're talking about the social determinants of health, all this stuff.

451
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:30,010
A lot of the focus is down here.

452
01:10:30,010 --> 01:10:40,150
And the potential impact of that? Well, it's it's unclear.

453
01:10:40,150 --> 01:10:46,160
If you haven't read the lamp's piece, you should read it, because that's exactly what she is talking about.

454
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:55,150
And today reading. The risks of thinking about social determinants of health.

455
01:10:55,150 --> 01:11:05,690
In a purely downstream focus of medical care is problematic.

456
01:11:05,690 --> 01:11:18,480
She identifies big risks that might occur by doing that.

457
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:25,820
OK, so Thursday we can.

458
01:11:25,820 --> 01:11:31,610
We can we'll continue this conversation and we'll start with it on Thursday.

459
01:11:31,610 --> 01:11:37,400
We'll talk more about this idea of the social determinants of health, right.

460
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:42,470
You know, it's from the picture, but how does it work? How does it really operate?

461
01:11:42,470 --> 01:11:50,130
And what is it what why should we think about it when we're talking about health and health care and public health?

462
01:11:50,130 --> 01:11:58,350
Next week. Oh, did I right? Thursday, I think it's Tuesday, sorry, that Thursday should be Tuesday.

463
01:11:58,350 --> 01:12:11,560
Your population health assignment is due Tuesday and it's you looking at the population health characteristics for a particular county.

464
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:23,530
And then on Thursday or Tuesday, next week, you will talk about it in your bird teens, so just to make sure that's on your radar.

465
01:12:23,530 --> 01:12:29,990
And Thursday, if you have questions about that, we can we can talk about that.

466
01:12:29,990 --> 01:12:59,214
OK, I'll see you on Thursday.
