1
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:18,490
So today we're going to review some calls for a homework problem, too.

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,350
And we first are going to look at the statistics.

3
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:28,080
So suppose we have to test out.

4
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,660
The test results are either positive or negative.

5
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:43,070
And we we can use capacities fixed to evaluate the amount of agreement between two tests.

6
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:49,050
So. So.

7
00:00:51,690 --> 00:01:06,329
So this song is actually a formula of capacitive synth and p zero is the probability of agreement and P is a probability of agreement.

8
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:15,720
One The two tests are related. So once you calculate the capacitive search, this is how you interpret the results.

9
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:23,790
So if a capacitive surface is negative, then you indicate that to the test.

10
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:27,120
Results from two parts are very different.

11
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:37,469
So we can suggest that there was poor agreement between two tests and from 0 to 0.2.

12
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:44,180
You say that we haven't. So here's a fake example we are going to use.

13
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:49,800
So. Suppose that there are two matches.

14
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:55,980
Can we use two tests for diabetes? One is our test and one is test.

15
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:01,530
And we want to use capacities checked to determine if our two methods will agree.

16
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:14,640
So here we collect data from 186 participants and for each participant recollect they are the test result and our test result.

17
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:22,710
So we can see that among these people, 31 of them are getting positive from both tests.

18
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:29,580
So using cells, we can just infer that they have.

19
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:37,590
So. So we input a data or a test and the test fellow results will be either positive or negative here.

20
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:43,020
And frequency is just a cell comes from ABC.

21
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:51,210
So it was a 31, A, B, C, D and using perfect statement, we can calculate the capacities.

22
00:02:52,320 --> 00:03:00,330
And so here we put the roll counts to the table and column names of all two by two table,

23
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:09,510
and using every statement to calculate the capacity six and the test they will give your hypothesis, hypothesis, test result.

24
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:16,920
So from this example, we can see that the capacities test is equal to 0.6.

25
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:20,970
And this is their confidence in the role and test.

26
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:26,430
So from this we can suggest that these two passed.

27
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:31,370
Four families are coming to the surface between these two values.

28
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:36,850
So we can suggest that there was substantial agreement between two parties.

29
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:43,350
And it also I'll you a my test result.

30
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:49,190
So and this is our code for capacitors.

31
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:59,810
So you're basically just encode creates a matrix of dataset and input and I buy the API cells from this to write a table.

32
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:07,520
And your shadow column member of column equal to zero equals a true value empirical data by row.

33
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:15,560
So is this. So are various like 31, six, 14 and 165 and this parent.

34
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:27,100
And by winning the. Now you also talk about labor for about how long and this is or a this is a real name on your column.

35
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:37,020
And so your try to table rounding off your table will be oral that go across and the column will be standing at the bottom

36
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:47,650
and how you can just using add margins to calculate the column some and total some of the back to table so this is all.

37
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,380
That allows you after adding margins.

38
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:59,970
So I can see this is a I've seen these cells and there are totals down column totals.

39
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:12,840
And after that you can use Kohan to have higher function from the side package and just put your data into this function so it will give you this one,

40
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:17,870
your flow capacitor six and the lower bound and upper bound of this,

41
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:32,220
which is similar to the difference of two highlighted in the weighted, is that is not a different formula to ask you.

42
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:40,010
If you are using more than one, you should indicate, right?

43
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:46,110
And I'm sure. Yeah. So in this case there is one.

44
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:50,900
So for each. So it will get similar results from this.

45
00:05:50,910 --> 00:06:01,110
To add another package you can use is apple tools and for tools are your.

46
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:08,000
Now I'll start you another function of how to function from our package.

47
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:14,790
And. You should implement the individual data into this function.

48
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:21,840
So before we implement this data, we need to create individual data so that each role will be the.

49
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:36,260
Catch results for each participant. So we extend that table from ethics tools and poker summary data here to guide to the default data here.

50
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:43,320
And you can see the individual data. So check the individual data for each line.

51
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:47,240
You can see this is the test results for each person.

52
00:06:49,440 --> 00:07:01,180
And after that you can just input individual data into your cup to function and it will give you the same patches which should.

53
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:13,420
Yeah. Give you a little hypothesis test for caching.

54
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:28,150
No hypothesis. Just cap had equal to zero and for maximum our test you need to use this function.

55
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:35,750
From our account, this package and show you we're going to put your summary data and using correct.

56
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:45,670
Total false. So you will go for pacifistic equal to 3.2 and a p value your score turn around 0.0.

57
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,240
So you also can calculate the ratio based on this example.

58
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:57,210
So. Are you okay in there?

59
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:06,900
I also asked which tasks are more likely to get a positive result so you can think of diabetes after a positive

60
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:18,600
after outcome variable and your task as your predictor and calculate the after ratio of drugs for each participant.

61
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:34,110
So. So before recalculating outro shall we can just cradle individual individual two by two tables for each person.

62
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:42,360
So here's the summary data. So we can see that 31 of them are getting positive from both tests.

63
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:47,670
So we'll try to table. We'll be like this one. This is a test.

64
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:56,100
This is a testable and this is a password cell sharable so we can see all 31 but I'm not giving one

65
00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:04,260
has a different world has positive transboundary test and six of them are getting positive from test,

66
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:10,440
negative from standard test and so on.

67
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:16,020
So you can just translate this data to create a series off track.

68
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:27,990
I just had a goal for each person. And so to create data in SAS, we just basically froze the summary data here.

69
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:33,870
And don't forget to use quite equal to one, at least as a cell count.

70
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:44,340
That's just the test. Terrible. So once is equal to a positive answer, of course, a pitch and using after that,

71
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:52,300
after data for summary data, you can then create data for individual level data.

72
00:09:52,380 --> 00:10:03,720
So we first set the diabetes data and then we using these calls to create individual data so that

73
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:11,310
each person have one pass through cells for all tasks and once has reached fat cells for standard.

74
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:15,180
So each person will have to win something. Yeah.

75
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:23,970
So this is individual data and after that you can just do your thing and put your data into pressure statement

76
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:32,730
and using this as a role variables criteria is your test result and response and see which test you choose.

77
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,510
And I is a stratification variable.

78
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:45,000
So it's actually your statement to calculate the odds ratio, at least a variable of just four and using watch statement.

79
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:49,440
So here's the odds ratio you've got.

80
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:53,510
So we've got associated controls 0.4.

81
00:10:54,740 --> 00:11:00,380
And that's just the combination. And so in our.

82
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:08,850
We are going to do the same thing. So we basically just create a bunch of factors.

83
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:16,380
So for example, I use just all the air cells from all the individuals.

84
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:22,740
So you can see that the first 31 people will get out of here from.

85
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,340
All of which is at equals to one.

86
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:34,270
And then six people won't get equal to one and 14 people get an equal to zero.

87
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:40,000
There are 135 people getting zero for ADD.

88
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:56,260
So we just create a repeatable 31 plus six package and then we create repeat zero 14 plus 138.

89
00:11:56,830 --> 00:12:02,260
So this is just unconscious by self. And the same.

90
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:13,910
And therefore I can just import an API IPA and using carrot equals false to calculate the answer, which also is actually a waste.

91
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:20,110
We use this function to calculate the mental pencil come out ratio.

92
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:31,370
So this is the adoration you get and this is how you interpret the results.

93
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:38,090
So US-Russia estimate is 0.42 with 95% confidence interval.

94
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:46,820
So what? You mean fact? And there are people equal to 0.073.

95
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:53,200
So we have to now recheck H. No hypothesis at all.

96
00:12:54,980 --> 00:13:02,780
0.05 that falls. So we can call that there is a margin or evidence for the art of diagnosing diabetes.

97
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:13,340
Using oral Google test is lower than the odds of diagnosing your thought to test disagree.

98
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,410
So if you have questions you.

99
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:37,000
So if we infer as a result of if less confidence in the road as a ratio is greater than one, and these are only this quarter instead of 0.05,

100
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:47,350
that answer up or so points are, then we can actually conclude that after diagnosing diabetes,

101
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:53,620
using this analysis is greater than that, which means that.

102
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:59,680
Our oral attacks are more likely to get you more powerful.

103
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:10,030
All right. So any change on that song?

104
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:17,050
Can I use the curse? Okay.

105
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:23,170
So this I saw Chappelle's Show.

106
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:33,700
So. Suppose we have rockers.

107
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:40,760
Suppose we have the small and. So using a previous example, suppose.

108
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:54,710
Much. Sociopath.

109
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:03,910
Like, for example, your past. You have two past and one test result is final outcomes.

110
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:06,970
And one test result is continuous variable.

111
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:17,480
And in the homework problem too, you can regard your one of a past as assignment and one of a task after school.

112
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:21,840
So for example. That's one.

113
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:32,870
So if we watch you, you're saying, oh, great, build a wall, just a model, and you're seeing the binary outcome path.

114
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:36,110
Terrible. Our response, terrible.

115
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:44,650
And then another test result, continuous results at our present turnaround, you can use this shown to create the rocket.

116
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:49,580
And after that, after your putting a rocket, you can.

117
00:15:53,290 --> 00:16:04,410
I'm sure. Sounds. I was on this.

118
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,700
Yeah. So.

119
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:35,040
And after I you can just using this same.

120
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:46,060
To calculate, to visualize your sensitivity and specificity for each threshold.

121
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:53,320
So this one, you can also print this one by using a same.

122
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:13,640
So it was a pretty intense. Yeah.

123
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:28,390
So this one. So it will give you a large threshold and a corresponding sensitivity and specificity.

124
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:41,200
So you can just based on this value, you calculate them to form what what threshold is you're using the threshold part.
