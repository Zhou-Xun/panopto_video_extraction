1
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,750
Good morning. So we'll get started.

2
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:29,640
One thing, anything you want to discuss before we get into the topic?

3
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:41,980
Release them to you. The water. I read the PDF articles they put on the one about the cooling towers on the like half room.

4
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:43,060
But that was interesting.

5
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:54,930
And then like, there was the, like, I think it was like a handbook or guideline of all the ways to disinfect the and eliminate Legionella.

6
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:05,380
And but I was reading that one. It didn't necessarily give like a paragraph or anything of stating like, what's in the ideal world, the best case.

7
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:10,590
Like, it just laid out the pros and cons. It kind of let the reader decide, like, what's applicable with that.

8
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:18,730
So I was just wondering, what if I if all conditions were perfect, what would be the most effective method of treating it?

9
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:24,430
Okay, that's a that's a very quick well worth getting to. That's what we would like to work it out.

10
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:29,890
So. So some say it's always a kind of balance.

11
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:36,340
I mean, for them to just use a COVID as example, everyone say, yeah, we'll take it zero, I'll be great.

12
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,950
I mean, this is the stupidest policy to use. Take you right now. Okay. Because zero policy.

13
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:48,060
Okay. Don't get me wrong. And. But the ideal situation would be like we'll be zero.

14
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:53,690
There's no disease, no no virus, no effects of communicable diseases.

15
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,380
But that's not the ideal situation.

16
00:01:55,980 --> 00:02:03,980
But the reality is that will not be the case when we involve all these every just appear sort of pure on the planet.

17
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,520
Okay. We already live together with.

18
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:14,940
Virus bacteria. We evolved through this day.

19
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:21,240
Is. Is always a face. Always a badass. So.

20
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:29,850
So. Don't think about will give your. Okay. But with all we understand and assure you, we can make it under control.

21
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:36,920
Make it more beneficial to us. What he meant was think about what treatment it's.

22
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:47,490
Due their human civilization. The two two things I would say two or three, maybe three, choosing the two categories,

23
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:54,060
surely one is the medicine development that helps us to extend our life expectancy.

24
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:59,580
The other one is really. Clean water sanitation.

25
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:05,350
This is one of the key factors that effects extend our lifespan.

26
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,770
Everything about now we don't have anybody except water and the kids will care.

27
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:14,670
That's reading the mortality rate of the key of a five year old.

28
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:19,800
Some countries are still very high. That's one week period before you increase.

29
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:25,050
So our life expectancy probably next 30 or 40 years old.

30
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,990
But we are getting older. Your immune system like, really weakens.

31
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:36,340
And then this bugs will kill you. Because we are exposed to all the time that's how have get involved.

32
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:40,610
That's really you think about the human evolution. Yes. That's.

33
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,610
But now, should we really kill all these bugs?

34
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:55,510
Maybe not, because that's also kind of a balance that help us to modulate or improve our immune system.

35
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:00,940
Train our immune system so that we can kill is really the best approach is really

36
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:08,730
how can we make it under control so that we can try to reduce the nervous.

37
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:13,970
I'll come. You extend the benefit from this that you get.

38
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:17,370
But. Don't think about it can get it to the.

39
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:25,740
So would be would legionella and a very small amount, would that be helpful to our immune system?

40
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:30,480
It depends. That's really depends. Did you ever go back?

41
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:36,040
I mean, it's pretty. That happened back to the pilot, but. Yes.

42
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,810
Yes, but but that's also dependent on your host.

43
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,930
I want to talk about the disease. Yeah. I really like the host.

44
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:50,100
Also play a very important role here. So, like, if you're not over 50 years old, not a smoker, and like if you're young,

45
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:57,940
yeah, you can really have your immune system change your immune system.

46
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:05,350
So when we talk about public health, we try to reduce the mortality of obesity rates.

47
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:09,250
Right. But then we talk about a risk. There's acceptable risk.

48
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:19,510
And what is acceptable risk? We, the community can accept or the public health can accept that that's the threshold we need to keep in mind.

49
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:23,820
Okay. Drinking water is surely one of the key.

50
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:33,440
We cannot really say we will get rid of all the contaminants in the water, making it zero.

51
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:38,290
That was. It's not realistic to take anything is not necessary.

52
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:45,399
Okay. And the effects when I talk about the balance,

53
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:52,870
although there's no really strong scientific evidence in the in the middle with the Middle East countries,

54
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:56,670
some of like rich countries, they use discrimination.

55
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:01,180
And basically they move all these contaminants from seawater.

56
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:10,570
And what they found is that. Was a felony, that that could impact the cardiovascular system.

57
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:18,350
Think about people. What's it while water. You drink the water in someone's mind or all the others.

58
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,850
Just a little bit comparing to what are you intake from a food.

59
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:28,900
Right. So why that matters. Know how long the water was there.

60
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:33,610
Your stomach. Is it due to a cup of water? How long was that in your stomach?

61
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:40,960
How you how do you get into your stomach if you've ever drinking a cup of what?

62
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:46,910
And depends on how much your body needs more than water. Right.

63
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:52,070
But just like I always. Several minutes and 2 minutes.

64
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:56,590
Okay. The food of 7 hours. Right. So.

65
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:01,730
So imagine out if you visit. If I have an empty stomach right now, I drink a lot of water.

66
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:06,400
But if the water is. Lack of minerals.

67
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:15,920
The PSC is not in the right venue in the right range, so that will impact our ABC system, our in the digests very quickly.

68
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:27,670
So although you see when you eat the food, you are supplementing with some of these minor and all these but effects these frequent stu

69
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,930
a stimulation on your immune system in your cells will have some impacts because of water.

70
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:38,750
So, so every water probably contains a very limited amount of the mind in the total amount of meat.

71
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:45,880
But on the other hand, we can have the more frequent interaction with the APC cells.

72
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:55,070
To think about it as reason why we say water also, yes has play a very important word as a disease biology to promote your health.

73
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:05,580
Okay. To promote your health. So although although the impacts or effect may be subtle.

74
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:08,880
So we don't really see like, kill you. Okay.

75
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:15,690
But long term, for the long term use, you may have some weak correlation with certain type of health conditions.

76
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:23,720
Okay. With health conditions. But on the other hand, some people will sell the product to you.

77
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:31,070
They said, know, I have the magnetic water. That can seriously improve your House budget system.

78
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:34,730
QUESTION Have a question on that? Okay. I have a question mark on that.

79
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:39,530
And some of them is not really scientifically.

80
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:45,370
Truth. It is no coincidence that they are all frank.

81
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:50,290
And even with the supplements we know there is also a lot of controversy on the supplements.

82
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:55,510
But we do have I mean, we do have no matches for the supplements.

83
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:05,139
Huge market for supplements. But even there's no strong scientific study to demonstrate that health benefits.

84
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:11,670
That's your choice. I mean I mean, basically, that's your choice. You can choose whatever you want to eat and that's your choice.

85
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:20,570
But but but just think twice about it when you try to take some of this, whether it's really helpful.

86
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,590
Okay. And the water shown is not.

87
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:29,690
I mean, don't. I mean, there's some pseudo I was silly.

88
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:34,150
Some statements, you know, in the commercials.

89
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:37,740
You know, my water is blah, blah, blah, blah.

90
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:47,670
Okay. Question. We presume that income is really health benefits from this that.

91
00:09:51,340 --> 00:10:00,370
But I think the the one thing the topic we talking about today, it's not, you know, think about Imam House.

92
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:05,350
Think about Imam the house. What are we folks mostly are.

93
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:23,740
And within human health sciences, the health impact from exposure to to humans or to society to the to the health toxicants to the chemicals.

94
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:28,150
So the primary concern is very chemical.

95
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,140
So we really took a lesson about my colleagues. Okay.

96
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:40,830
So really this about the microwave because the microwave was thinking about communicable diseases that it really belongs to in the house.

97
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:53,590
Okay. Because now the the chemicals that don't really communicate with each other from the transmission from person to person.

98
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,209
But surely the with the infant is a different story.

99
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:05,770
Like when you take the milk, that's a different story. But but you give them the exposure that's individualized.

100
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:09,159
You'll be exposed to certain template environments.

101
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:15,520
That's your exposure. You don't really there's no transmission from person to person.

102
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:25,240
Same thing. Of the the chemicals but legionella bacteria in terms of the infectious disease.

103
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:37,480
The Geneva Protocol for varies very perfectly in that kind of strict definition of the House, if I'm with you is because.

104
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:46,060
When you get the medium in, it's very likely come from the poorer to the wall.

105
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:54,520
Okay. It's not likely if you for example, if we sit together, you call out the general from.

106
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:59,380
Okay. Some other community leaders make the call.

107
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:03,640
Kobe, Kobe South, Kobe two. That's where you sit together.

108
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:08,200
You talk to each other. It's very likely you address the media that this is our fight.

109
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:13,820
But this does not apply to. Okay.

110
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:19,520
There's nothing to really apply to the media now that Nigeria is kind of a strict environment, environmental.

111
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:28,880
Peasants. Okay. When you get infection it's very likely that you want to source is very likely some at war.

112
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:35,120
Okay. Questions.

113
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:46,180
So I guess it's like this is it. You know, it's under biological agents that is part of environment, but that affects human health.

114
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:51,520
Recognizing that the show is about engaging with our bodies.

115
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,670
I mean, most of all, most of these that are going to create human hazards.

116
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:04,240
Some of the television can only be in the environment that only survive in the host.

117
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:15,070
But some of them and but most of them some people you'll see they'll be able to survive posted signature of top in the amount.

118
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,300
Okay. So that's been part of the transmission pathway.

119
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:29,100
Okay. The present was in direct transmission and then the the oral fecal, possibly the possibly transmission.

120
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:47,430
Anyone wrote about the meeting in outbreaks. My high school went to high school when I went, oh, god, the 2000 to 2010.

121
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:53,490
Okay. Okay. Because I'm ten and very recent on the news.

122
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:59,130
Is fieldwork rises. Okay. Genesee County.

123
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:05,380
They have the higher. Instance of an infection and then people die.

124
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:10,820
So if people dies, that's very reasons. Just linked to the workplace.

125
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,370
You may wonder why you friends? Wow.

126
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:22,080
Surely you can find it so that you can win.

127
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,610
Right. Because they have the issues with the drinking water, water crisis.

128
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:30,930
And then you'll see the the the the outbreaks.

129
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:35,730
Increase cases Genesee County in Flint.

130
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:39,510
Now how do demonstrates how do you demonstrate.

131
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:46,710
The cases are caused by the contamination in the drinking water, as another study in the study dismissed.

132
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:54,150
There's no direct proof. There's no direct proof to say yes because the people are doing the water before the infection,

133
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:03,900
but they do these risk assessments as a likelihood or from the is probably three times higher because you can detect water difference against.

134
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:11,410
So that's pretty strong evidence to suggest that. So that's just the recent case.

135
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:18,330
And I really legionella becomes a topic, hot topic when we have these couple weeks before we have the cold,

136
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:22,920
before have the cold and regionally the hot topic.

137
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:29,049
In the water quality management. Okay. Especially in the building.

138
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:31,440
But. So we'll see why.

139
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:43,740
So that's reason I really tried to get a specific topic on this on the governor, so we can have a better understanding why the amendment is essential.

140
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:48,960
To protect the public health, ensuring that the.

141
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:58,980
What are these bacteria? The bacteria is gram negative, raw aerobic bacteria.

142
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:03,330
So this is it actually looks like it's Arabic Rorschach.

143
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,440
You can find in the order.

144
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:18,790
But in this in this family, we have like probably more than 50 species, but only that in 19 species could cause the human infection.

145
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:27,850
Okay, Newman, if you're my filler, filler is the most common and fun majority,

146
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:33,190
for example, for whites in the in the in the cases in the infecting the human.

147
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:39,370
But some of the non beta it's more commonly Australia New Zealand in China.

148
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:49,030
But Legionella pneumonia Pneumophila is the one of the major dominant strains of species that cause infection.

149
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:58,000
In the rest of the what? 80% is more than 80%. So this is a bacteria you can see looks like under the microscope.

150
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:07,610
So you have the disease. What is the original idea this looks like?

151
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:17,330
We have this severe a typical pneumonia like infection that's really affecting the cough,

152
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:23,480
shortness of breath, fever in some serious cases like nausea, confusing.

153
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:31,250
Normally, I mean, after 2 to 10 days, sometimes we have the risk of failure.

154
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:34,770
Shock, typical the days when I'm not taking it.

155
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:38,720
I mean, especially from people with immune system, they have high risk.

156
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:43,040
So it's like a cough, like a like a pneumonia.

157
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:51,380
So we're assuming if you have the cough, shortness of breath, and then you also have this Pontiac fever.

158
00:17:53,120 --> 00:18:02,330
It's a mild flu like illness. And then you have this allergenic reaction of the toxins, sometimes also from the lung toxic bacteria.

159
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:08,030
And then we also have the asymptomatic a lot of times. You have it or you do have symptoms.

160
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:13,790
So very dependent on the host factors are specific. Also play a role in this kind of case.

161
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:21,710
Yeah, this is one of the high risk area when you enjoy the hookup with your friends.

162
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:29,030
Okay. I'm not saying don't do that. I'm just saying this is a high risk area if you are.

163
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:37,129
I mean, for young people, probably are fine. But if you take the medication, sometimes you don't really feel well.

164
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:43,160
And so you twice. Think twice. The problem.

165
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:48,410
What the problem is that right now we see increased incidence of heart disease.

166
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:54,070
Okay. In Europe, for example.

167
00:18:54,320 --> 00:19:01,500
The one per 100,000 case. And the United States would have more than 4000.

168
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:06,000
Now it's it's much higher. This is 2011.

169
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:10,180
If you have the nowadays, you probably more than 10,000 always.

170
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:24,900
Okay. In terms of the occurrence and then in error will in Australia for example, we also have the the more than 700 mean also about 200,000.

171
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:30,050
So worldwide this is the increase. So we want to why is that right.

172
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:36,570
So why we see some to see the in any these cases of Legionnaires disease or infections.

173
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:49,810
This is the the is this case 400,000 again you as you start from 2000 as thousand something around this time.

174
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:54,250
But what you can see here now we see really increase them right.

175
00:19:54,520 --> 00:20:02,630
What's what is acceptable risk we normally talk about. What is acceptable risk?

176
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:09,930
Four incidences. Yeah, four instances. I'm guessing like one in 100,000.

177
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:19,560
So what are 400,000 per year? Yeah, that's, that's the, the, the risk level we can't tolerate.

178
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:28,420
I mean that's reason one would define all these standards are kind of based on this level of risk.

179
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:33,990
So if the seeds that it is now, what type of action plants.

180
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:39,980
So that's what we're dealing with right now. Right now, because we see all this much higher than this one now.

181
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:43,760
I mean, if it's if it's probably like 0.43.

182
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:51,270
Okay. I mean, we cover some other also, but now because that's above the threshold as to what potential.

183
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,720
Okay. I mean, it's not like right or wrong, right?

184
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,130
It's not right or wrong, which really puts you earlier is not right.

185
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:04,970
Right. Just missing the label. We kind of define actually future define.

186
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:10,860
How do we accept that here? Look out for one out of 100,000 per year.

187
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:15,330
That's the of now there's probably like more than 10,000.

188
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,350
And the other thing also,

189
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:28,710
when we talk about outbreaks in the United States in terms of the the waterborne diseases associated with drinking water, for example.

190
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,560
And you'll see this here. This is what happened.

191
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:45,410
I mean, we still see like 20 cases around 20, 30 cases every year are ready to go on.

192
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:49,190
So the original with us is a big country.

193
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:56,210
The mean is the country. So everyone we see this probably I mean, reasonable is reasonable, right?

194
00:21:56,420 --> 00:22:00,110
Compared to the other risks, we think about it. Right. So.

195
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:04,930
No. And then you see about 50%.

196
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:11,880
I really related to the Legionella disease outbreaks.

197
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:19,680
So you can end up contribute around 50% to the incidence of outbreaks in the United States.

198
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:26,910
What happened around the 1980s, there is like the highest peaks there.

199
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:35,670
Some here. Yeah. You know, I don't know what's really the reason for that, but I don't know what what bacteria causes.

200
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:48,780
But it's not rampant legionella. But this is right before you know about right before the the outbreak of the crypto outbreak in Milwaukee.

201
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:53,370
Okay. So what you can see here now you see the jobs.

202
00:22:54,330 --> 00:23:03,400
Okay. Is that because the outbreaks in the group, two outbreaks in the Milwaukee cause a lot of attention to drinking lot of.

203
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:10,870
So petition up now for the authority to pay a lot of attention to the drinking water so they improve the system.

204
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:23,030
I mean, that's that's really one of the instance. Induce how people pay attention people die from that and is no that is not for me to work crisis.

205
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:28,720
Before we say, oh yeah, it's okay with already to worry about drinking wine now.

206
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:35,180
But then from you know what the price is now. So, you know, I see a lot of me set priorities, not invest in this area.

207
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:42,870
EPA, federal governments, state governments, local governments, they invest heavily in reducing quality for structure.

208
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:51,000
And this historically tells you that. And in fact, if you look at the data, probably in the coming years,

209
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:57,210
you'll probably see a drop of these outbreaks as well, because we invest, we improve the system.

210
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:02,340
And this is also around that period of time. Okay.

211
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:10,050
So if you look at this instance,

212
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:23,340
most of the instance associated with buildings in the US United States 65 due to process failures, 52 due to human error.

213
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:30,000
And, and then really this is what management calls this issue.

214
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,800
So what's the regulation that we have was originally the drinking water.

215
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:42,480
Worse than that we have. Anyone can still remember.

216
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:48,520
To come extent of when you get into.

217
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:11,249
Zero zero. Austrian Technology MCO AMC, amc amc.

218
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:16,680
Each year mhclg lets themselves users zero.

219
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:40,330
Right. What is every year? Sydney Embassy Embassy area.

220
00:25:51,320 --> 00:26:09,590
Five. Oh, there are amakhosi arms here and sale amakhosi.

221
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:14,590
That's the goal here. And you mentioned the.

222
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:28,280
So it's not enforceable or not enforceable.

223
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,500
Okay. Okay. On the EPA website, it says no limit.

224
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:38,360
Truman and technology dominate declines. Okay, so.

225
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:42,350
MCO zero, right? MCO We don't have it.

226
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:47,080
Okay. TRUMP So that means it's not a zero. Right.

227
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:53,350
So what do you think about now? All the tap water coming to your 31 houses?

228
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:59,570
Do you think the inspectors will be out of there? Very likely.

229
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:05,580
We don't expect it to be there. Yeah, we don't expect that we will be able to eradicate inequity.

230
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:09,420
Yeah. Okay. But I do like the outlook for the monies.

231
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,800
You expect you'll be due to Nigeria, that you expect it will be there.

232
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:18,170
I mean, you said wow. So we probably zero. But thank you.

233
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:21,980
We're busy. Okay. So.

234
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:29,600
So then when they get in the building now well lobby zero when they come to the building.

235
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:35,210
But in the building now. Can come up, regroup.

236
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:42,030
So we'll think about what was the reason. So could be 10 to 20 times higher than the reports.

237
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:48,350
Is this. So it's much higher than we think is the leading cause of drinking water outbreaks.

238
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:53,350
Now, it's the leading cause. Cause. This was originally in the United States.

239
00:27:53,370 --> 00:28:00,240
Could it be? Now, this is again, this is 2013 data, but it would be much higher now.

240
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,860
And the fact in the acronym outbreak in 2000.

241
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:16,800
You see the the for this some hospitalized 100 cases just you want to associate with the legionella outbreak.

242
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:23,990
So now where the exposure to the region in. Okay.

243
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:31,770
Any places you have the water, you have aerosols. And that's a source, you'll get exposed.

244
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:40,100
Okay. Exposure, for example, here could impose as a major source one of the major.

245
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:48,190
We'll talk about the major source where the legionella survive and reproduce, multiply.

246
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:52,230
Okay. And then so be pools. How many fires?

247
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:56,709
Okay, first pool volcanoes. That's another place.

248
00:28:56,710 --> 00:29:00,340
You'll have these legionella respirators.

249
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:09,120
Yeah. This is another. Devices. We are very interesting.

250
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:19,410
We are getting old. You need that to to to help you, because otherwise you have a period of sleep of these symptoms and you cannot cannot breathe.

251
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:24,330
And they need help from respiratory to help to breathe.

252
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:30,060
Ice machines, feeding tubes, sparse dental units and shower.

253
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:37,780
So, again, is on the list because these these places, if you take the shower, you get exposed to.

254
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:44,310
That's the two locations. So why the.

255
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:48,650
How this all supplies can get contaminated for the later price.

256
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:53,940
Normally there's a risk you have in the in the in the in the in the reverse.

257
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:57,240
For example, the risk is there. Okay.

258
00:29:57,390 --> 00:30:04,650
But I mean, you could have swimming unless you go to the the the only river we talk about is the Yellowstone

259
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:09,630
because the temperature they have so they can promote the growth that could be the higher risk.

260
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:17,340
And then Colin Powell for all this amplified so they can present into the war cry the amplify regroup.

261
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:21,490
Basically, they regroup. Okay.

262
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:28,630
I can like to grow also when the the water aging problem occurs because it's bothersome

263
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:33,930
also to management and then the temperature in the temperature predominates.

264
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:42,130
If it's less than 20 degrees and then when you have the 35, the optimal temperature range, the warm water for one we have.

265
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:49,180
That's the place. There's another factor. Could you go to that? I mean, if it's more than 70 degrees, you'll kill them.

266
00:30:49,390 --> 00:31:02,760
So what's a normal temperature for our whole water system? Anyone can check.

267
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:08,080
What's the temperature? No more hot water temperature. 100 degrees.

268
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:13,010
100 degree Celsius Fahrenheit.

269
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:21,200
See. Also, I will kill you if you take the television at the border.

270
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:25,130
I got 120 degrees for 120 degrees.

271
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:29,450
Safety recommendations. Safety recommendations. Common default setting.

272
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:33,500
Yeah. Okay. Okay. So right around this range.

273
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:44,740
Right. As a whole range, right? This optimal optimum temperature range for the area to grow through the black hole system.

274
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:50,670
Okay. Including power in the system.

275
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:54,420
Yeah. Water system.

276
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:59,570
And they have this one temperature logic system.

277
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:03,620
So what we can see here really is that when it come to the building,

278
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:09,890
we have the system there and then you can promote the vehicles model application in the system.

279
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:16,270
Then when they get to get exposed to the hot shower, hot topic for you, then that's good time.

280
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:21,320
Okay. And that's really the case in the case.

281
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:27,910
So that's how it happened. Why it happened like this. So how it's affected is the.

282
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:36,690
This. You wanna get exposed to.

283
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:44,009
For example, you have the construction caused contamination and then you have we'll talk about

284
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:49,140
really the biofilms on the on the pipes and then temperature as temperature.

285
00:32:50,010 --> 00:33:01,560
What temperature? So growth now in the very large buildings, a complex even on high and high rises buildings.

286
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:10,000
See how company the system ever was with this building. You already see how complex system is.

287
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:16,990
Okay. Not to mention, if you go to high school at the high rise buildings, you'll see how complex the system is.

288
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:24,790
And that's really where the vision in our girls and then continuing our slide through the devices, cooling towers,

289
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:32,590
shower hot tub fountains, and then you get exposed to oak and they all have the risk people in like five, 50 years old.

290
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:38,800
Smoker. People with a weakened immune system.

291
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:46,180
Chronic disease. And also when you have this heavy contamination, air pollution.

292
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:51,220
And I will talk about the emergency. For example, if you have these five.

293
00:33:52,510 --> 00:34:00,070
And then you take CO2 and then you can weaken your emissions and also your your patriarchy, your law.

294
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:04,600
And then that's make it easier for Legionella to colonize and cause infections.

295
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:11,300
So. We have.

296
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:16,860
Disinfection, virtual drinking, water resistant. Okay.

297
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:24,170
We do have that. Okay. We have the minimum confusion requirement in our justice system.

298
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:27,740
It's not really probably either in the in the building.

299
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:31,760
We don't really cannot maintain our high crimes ratio of the rangers.

300
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:36,150
Okay. In the buildings, like especially in the complex buildings.

301
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:41,010
But in the district system, we shall be able to maintain. That's that's required.

302
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:45,000
Okay. But we talk about issues of pipes that we have.

303
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:52,290
This is a party we have. This is where we get our drinking water.

304
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:57,200
Okay. If you look at the pipes, don't be surprised.

305
00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:02,410
That's the common. This is very common types we have.

306
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:13,270
And for example, here we see the plans, pubs, clubs up to have and this is George, this skating and bar films.

307
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:21,429
And that is these, it looks like. And this is where all the ceremonies, the Legion and all the go up to this page.

308
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:27,800
In fact, they get. Protected, I feel, in this environment in the battlefield.

309
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:32,490
That's one reason. I mean, and we know that.

310
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:36,490
We know that on the pipes. On the pipes.

311
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:42,340
We have all the bathrooms there, so. And then you wonder why.

312
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:45,640
Why Flint's has more exposure by the Flint.

313
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:54,100
Is it similar cases in France? Everyone can see why that.

314
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:01,640
Why it is that you see the increased cases in Flint.

315
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:10,100
What happened? You switch their water source.

316
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:13,750
The future workforce of the U.S.

317
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:20,590
Okay. Why then? So why the freeze? We see that the increase.

318
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:25,330
Because in a while the water would have a difficult ratio there.

319
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:29,620
So it kind of can kill the the video. It probably cannot really regrow.

320
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:32,710
There they go in the bath films. They can go in the bathroom.

321
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:38,470
But the dolphins. But now when we have this in The Friends.

322
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:46,850
We have detachment. But dispose of the skin from the pipes.

323
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:54,940
So a lot of bacteria might get into the bathwater then, which is very hard work anymore.

324
00:36:56,040 --> 00:37:04,710
Okay. Okay. So you basically now where you everything was in the bathrooms.

325
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:10,020
Okay. Sometime in this sloughing. But because now we have found only a lot of.

326
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:14,990
This was the laughing of this dolphin in the pipes.

327
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,200
You increase the concentration in the water.

328
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:25,030
As we have high E.coli and then you will see also any other countries you would need your help in a couple of.

329
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:32,680
So basically you increase the exposure that. Okay.

330
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:40,200
You increase the chance to. I tend to get into sports.

331
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:47,840
That's one of the reasons, one of the factors we believe that caused the 84 cases in Flint.

332
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:58,070
The other reason is that. In the drinking water system with serious amoeba.

333
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:05,500
Okay. The moving camel. The moving is high organism of the movie.

334
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:10,150
The feet are the bacteria. The bacteria as your food source.

335
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:19,750
Okay, so most of the time, you'll be able to. Just feed on the bacterial biomass, on the biofuels.

336
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:25,290
What happened is that Miguelina. This is a yellow here.

337
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:29,320
You can see the form. This vast cross in the amoeba.

338
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:33,960
I think it survives in. Okay.

339
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:42,110
We can survive it. So the disinfectants will not be able to kill them.

340
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:49,140
Okay. When they'll be able to kill them. You said. They will be able to survive.

341
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:53,510
So they can survive is due to what is racism.

342
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:57,940
And then the media is protected. Okay.

343
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:06,520
So this just in fact. Now you see what temperature complex system and then this disinfectant.

344
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:11,050
And then we have this biofilms, and then this is some amoeba.

345
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:19,830
So all these factors can contribute to the survival and also multiplication of legionella.

346
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:24,300
Our water system. Okay.

347
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:32,290
You know our system. So that's the agents.

348
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:36,460
Think about the agents, not with the host factors. Who are the risk.

349
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:46,320
People. 50 years old, 50 years or older. Current or former smokers with a chronic lung disease like COPD.

350
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:51,880
People with a weak immune system taking the drugs. People with cancer.

351
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:55,130
People with underlying early signs. Diabetes. Kidney failure. And a new.

352
00:39:57,030 --> 00:40:02,879
And also people who enjoy a hothouse. Some people really enjoy that or take very long time.

353
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,690
So that's all risk factors.

354
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:12,350
Okay. So so with this risk factors, now you see why we see more cases now.

355
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:19,680
What's a rhythm you think about? Think about what's the reason?

356
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:34,450
We see more cases than outbreaks. And the aging infrastructure and the biofilms.

357
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:39,460
The infrastructure biofilms used to me.

358
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:46,700
Now, with all this this high rise in buildings, all the hospitals, what we build.

359
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:54,420
40, 50 and 62 is only like.

360
00:40:55,640 --> 00:41:02,030
Somewhat dated under the youth element of this building we have in the United States some individual.

361
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:12,430
So that's aging. Infrastructure upgrades are very key because they can grow this file from some of this and then they can go and survive it.

362
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:18,310
And the other with these risk factors, we have see a few of those hosting and that will contribute to that.

363
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:39,280
So with risk factor, the risk of a risk that is here. Why we see the individual cases of Benny Goodman outbreaks.

364
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:49,350
Was a demographic change of the United States. There were older people.

365
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:52,880
Yes. Aging population. Okay.

366
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:59,780
Think about this, right? The people at higher risk is people 50 years or older.

367
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:05,060
And then we have this comedian, we have this age, more aging population.

368
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,450
Put this together. Now.

369
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:16,060
See, I think that's really this is the risk factor.

370
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:23,370
We can see the factors that contribute to the survival, to the to disease outbreak of this legionella.

371
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:33,620
So take home message here. Biofilms are always there to prevent or remove biofilms.

372
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:42,940
Method disinfectant. Me. Thank you for the horror.

373
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:46,630
One more, for example. And the other is these really prepared higher risk groups.

374
00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:51,610
Know if it's for something you probably want the ones who take the lead.

375
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:56,370
Take the hot tub. Something you get. Now.

376
00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:02,400
So let's take a quick break and then we'll talk about how do we deal with it?

377
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:09,040
What do we do? How do we deal with it? There are a lot of outbreaks in nursing homes.

378
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:12,820
Yeah. That's the that's high risk area.

379
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:26,610
After. It's not.

380
00:46:45,450 --> 00:46:51,060
So with outbreaks of the Legionella now, they how can we monitor them, how to manage them?

381
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:56,130
So first, we know that we need to detect it. We need to be able to detect them.

382
00:46:56,340 --> 00:47:00,510
So what approach we can use to to detect legionella?

383
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:07,680
We use cat specimens as is still a control business used by PCI as a media.

384
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:13,319
This is how this legionella cleaning looks like when you take the water and the showerhead of water flow.

385
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:15,000
And then if you touch them,

386
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:26,360
if you are legionella present and and you'll be able to see typical colony morphology of a medium in on this alga is not 100% selective,

387
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:37,830
but that's a good starting point. The other way is really the I mean, most some other way that we talk about the immuno versus assay,

388
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:46,290
all the examining assay, but most of the time we use polymerase chain reaction to the PCR identification for the detection.

389
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:55,710
So if you want to have this, you can go to the CDC or the EPA Web page to get this information to look at the methods we are using.

390
00:47:55,950 --> 00:48:00,450
So the commonly used methods with PCR, PCR has any mutations that we can.

391
00:48:00,450 --> 00:48:04,960
Only, if you take the DNA will not be able to see whether live and the.

392
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:09,300
So the culture of methods will be a good method for that.

393
00:48:09,390 --> 00:48:12,970
Of course, DNA as well. So what do we do?

394
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:20,440
What do we have in the United States in order to regulate the manjhi vis a vis the the Nigerian operates?

395
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:25,500
Yes. With 71 acts embassy air.

396
00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:30,720
Can go level a zero but.

397
00:48:31,790 --> 00:48:37,410
Is not impossible. Right. So we don't really force that. That means we don't really have a good regulation on the needs very.

398
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:40,790
Of the in the table. Okay. Do you want.

399
00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:47,690
So we we have some of these standards and then we have some guidelines.

400
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:56,980
The building guidelines assure and assure our courthouses Jews, Ghana, CDC, Ghana as well.

401
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:06,730
So that civil gardeners is talk about the the the the the the the deal with the

402
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:12,520
vision and especially now is risk management building work system from assure.

403
00:49:12,610 --> 00:49:20,860
This is a industrial association to talk about how can we control Angelina in your system in the premises basically.

404
00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:27,129
So that's that's the guidelines, though we have. European countries, for example.

405
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:30,490
This is what we have in the European countries.

406
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:44,079
Yeah, in the AC, in the cooling tower, there are some regulations regarding the Australia in Belgium and regarding the the the regulations in terms

407
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:52,070
of safety for the median inner target for potable water pipes use college good methods in the France.

408
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:57,130
This is a United Kingdom and shall be less 100 per millimeter.

409
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:00,940
Okay. It's a thousand and it's 150.

410
00:50:01,330 --> 00:50:04,600
And this is the. Probably the facilities.

411
00:50:05,650 --> 00:50:08,650
I'll put more pipelines and see here.

412
00:50:08,650 --> 00:50:15,310
Less than 100 CFU permitted either. You know, we've got nine, right?

413
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:25,780
We've got two. So even with HPC, we talk about is already in five, 500 per minute in the United States and in the 400.

414
00:50:26,050 --> 00:50:30,690
But then with the unknown effects, the timing and also the concentration.

415
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:36,490
So that's the the pretty weak regulations in terms of the of internal targets.

416
00:50:36,730 --> 00:50:37,750
We will look at these numbers.

417
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:49,010
So how do control usually in the in these in this how to control the legionella again when you have the water management program.

418
00:50:51,850 --> 00:50:56,860
That's 188. That's the what margin program, especially in the United States.

419
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:02,170
We don't really have the required to to monitor the need in either buildings.

420
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:12,530
Okay. In a few states, yes. New York, in Philadelphia, they have does have the regulations on the testing of Legionella in high rise buildings.

421
00:51:12,890 --> 00:51:16,000
Michigan didn't have that regulation. Okay.

422
00:51:16,370 --> 00:51:20,510
In most of the states. We don't really have the standards in terms of doing Legionella.

423
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:25,040
So that could be a good thing about when we start to regulate those.

424
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:28,820
That means they'll do more testing. Okay. Who gets for them?

425
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:37,820
But. During a Beatles. So when this when they pass the law.

426
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:43,450
Part of regulation. That means all these injuries has to do it to combine them.

427
00:51:44,170 --> 00:51:45,760
If you divest metals for me,

428
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:54,880
you'll be able to do the business because the can't do it and then they will not likely or this jury management won't be able to do this themselves.

429
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:59,360
They have have certified adapted it to the watch. Okay.

430
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:07,470
I just give you the business opportunities you can think of. Okay. And I mean I mean, I'm interested in this effect because I'm just curious.

431
00:52:07,470 --> 00:52:12,630
Okay. In terms of go to them. But I don't have the I don't have time for business.

432
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:22,590
But again, so this is the motto baby approach technological that and then we can see use a hazard analysis critical control power program in

433
00:52:22,590 --> 00:52:30,230
the asset is that to identify what's the weak point for the hospital especially in the hospital or senior homes in your homes?

434
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:41,080
How to do what's the control? Points, all the critical points, so that you can use this to to identify the points that I can to to to make.

435
00:52:41,350 --> 00:52:45,159
And then you have the what safety plans not to press the plan.

436
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:51,220
Sorry. So basically we have this have the one manager program to monitor that.

437
00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:54,380
Okay. And then say, what can we do if the outbreak.

438
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:58,660
Okay. What do you do? Have Arabic. So we have this curry.

439
00:53:00,050 --> 00:53:04,310
There's a pretty high concentration monochrome in print outside copper, silver,

440
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:11,750
U.V. ozone that can also be used to remove the biofilms or the imagery in the system.

441
00:53:12,830 --> 00:53:19,280
In the system. Now, most of this talk about the took up out of the control of the legionella in the water system.

442
00:53:19,570 --> 00:53:23,510
The do we have you the bathrooms the bathroom is a target.

443
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:27,220
So the does your forget about it then?

444
00:53:27,230 --> 00:53:32,240
No, they cannot do it. So they don't really talk about it. Okay.

445
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:35,570
You think I will control the biofuels in a system? You can only control it.

446
00:53:35,870 --> 00:53:39,410
You are really dealing with the symptom of the root cause.

447
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:46,880
Okay. We know. Okay. We know we cannot get to zero from the cup of water.

448
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:50,810
So we received a lot here at best in the pure water system.

449
00:53:51,470 --> 00:53:55,940
It will all be zero. You can get it. You'll have it. So.

450
00:53:57,380 --> 00:54:01,670
And then what's the emergency if you really have the highways emergency situation?

451
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:11,600
Basically, you do the super flush disinfection, soak up creation of a point of use filtration with other means.

452
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:18,500
So, for example, if you have this building or hopefully certain sectors, if you have really high vigilance.

453
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:26,060
So we do have the settlement system and they push with high power water there of these.

454
00:54:27,170 --> 00:54:32,540
Okay, Steve. And then you try to use that to.

455
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:40,650
Create a system to remove the invader or use certain states that use their high country.

456
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:45,880
Corey Try use that to kill. Kennedy and then you flushes.

457
00:54:47,830 --> 00:54:51,620
Okay. Try to remove the source. Let's hope we can be able to get rid of them.

458
00:54:51,670 --> 00:54:54,670
Okay. But very likely we stop.

459
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:58,860
We'll come back. Okay. Let's come back. So.

460
00:54:59,390 --> 00:55:02,900
So it's really like you can we're talking about we can get to zero.

461
00:55:03,830 --> 00:55:08,260
It's really like what can we do to make it under the management?

462
00:55:08,270 --> 00:55:16,580
They were below the seven mil so that we have no risk or we have the can we can control make it under the acceptable risk.

463
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:21,220
The 100,000. Okay.

464
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:27,560
So. And the Aussies use the filters. Oh, boy.

465
00:55:27,570 --> 00:55:31,830
The water. Okay. So, boy, the water is very efficient.

466
00:55:33,790 --> 00:55:43,030
But here we know. I mean. If on that situation you can use the boy was designed I've noticed that people the boy the water.

467
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:47,530
But we know here people don't really like to drink the boy to water to say.

468
00:55:49,290 --> 00:55:53,070
Okay. So that's that could be the case.

469
00:55:53,490 --> 00:55:58,740
So this is a technology we can use. I mean, you probably can find some new technologies and then.

470
00:56:00,210 --> 00:56:07,860
The mayors were just I should say this is a CDC guidelines developing a water management program to reduce immediate anti-growth spread in buildings.

471
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:17,220
Okay. That's the federal government. And then state government in the INC region in a world management program is a licensee

472
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:23,650
a provision for health care facilities to do building public home school codes for this,

473
00:56:23,670 --> 00:56:29,010
including the Legionella information will help local building owners carry out government.

474
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:32,970
So, for example, the big hospital like Michigan here.

475
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:38,090
You need to have this force management program. Okay.

476
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:45,150
Otherwise, if we don't do that, very likely we will have the hospital acquired infections, especially in the United.

477
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:49,640
If you have the building license in Michigan, possibly will be big news.

478
00:56:49,650 --> 00:56:56,390
Okay. Be pretty beat. That means we have some failure in terms of the water management.

479
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:08,160
So why do we see we talk about already increase these cases.

480
00:57:10,330 --> 00:57:14,320
Aging infrastructure. Aging population. Aging population.

481
00:57:15,430 --> 00:57:19,850
Okay. The the underlying conditions, health conditions.

482
00:57:19,890 --> 00:57:28,150
Right. So that's the all the risk factors associated with, for example, with injury and I think also contribute to the to the COVID.

483
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:35,030
Okay. But picking it enough, you know, we'll say probably we can say it's up to two stages.

484
00:57:35,430 --> 00:57:38,459
A lot of people like young people like you guys, they'll probably get it.

485
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:43,050
You'll be still. Okay, asymptomatic. Okay.

486
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:48,450
So why are the euro system of particular concern for spread of legionella?

487
00:57:51,840 --> 00:58:03,240
Why the bill was in the primary system. Why is noting the nature of water resources available to the biofilm amplified that.

488
00:58:05,290 --> 00:58:09,310
Right. Think about it. It's really like your whole system is amplified.

489
00:58:11,340 --> 00:58:19,800
Aging infrastructure also is really this with the regrow of generations, optimal conditions for them to grow.

490
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:24,930
Thickened stagnant water. Poor water. Warm temperature.

491
00:58:25,590 --> 00:58:29,100
And no disinfectant.

492
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:38,810
Religious. Okay. All of this contributes to the girls wrinkles before they get enough in the system.

493
00:58:40,590 --> 00:58:46,160
If it's natural water, maybe it happens to become a really good high conservation discipline here.

494
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:57,790
Yes, that's the biofilms. Aging infrastructure in the building complex system that increases the regrowth but also gets exposed.

495
00:58:58,850 --> 00:59:02,300
Right. Very likely with exposed to that through.

496
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:10,500
As Why is it so irresponsibly kissed? But as a we.

497
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:22,210
So what can we do to prevent an outbreak? Replace the infrastructure and remove the old people.

498
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:27,330
You cannot remove old people who think know. Okay.

499
00:59:27,710 --> 00:59:31,640
Okay. Is so interesting.

500
00:59:32,390 --> 00:59:42,090
One thing about Nike that tried to cut down the the spreads in the in the in the information community.

501
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:47,060
And I think the thing about the beautiful moment, if we have the political will, we do.

502
00:59:48,250 --> 00:59:54,970
With some of the practices within containment continued because they also kill the birds,

503
00:59:55,330 --> 01:00:05,180
I think with all of us, so that we can reduce the incubation because of the danger and maybe some of the people.

504
01:00:06,450 --> 01:00:09,590
Okay. So which is better than birds all of a sudden?

505
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:16,280
Well, arejust better than birds all of a sudden. Yeah, that's a protected public health, right?

506
01:00:16,550 --> 01:00:21,720
So we can't really make it. That's the way. I mean, people say, how can you control the virus?

507
01:00:21,740 --> 01:00:26,540
Well, that's what we do, control the spread of bird flu.

508
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:29,110
Okay. Because we show the both.

509
01:00:31,330 --> 01:00:40,870
Either way, we do it in the in the in the when we start to tell you this that of the virus in the in the in the chicken kills chicken.

510
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:45,729
And what would you tell people? I mean, that's not the way to do.

511
01:00:45,730 --> 01:00:50,680
It seems pretty effective to me and. No.

512
01:00:52,690 --> 01:00:56,620
And then why do you propose right to do so?

513
01:00:56,680 --> 01:01:07,030
But okay, so that's really the the the the the way when you protected people, putting people in healthy and also try to prevent,

514
01:01:07,030 --> 01:01:18,580
prevent them from getting exposed to it, reduce the exposure and hopefully we'll be able to give the vaccine against Legionella.

515
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:22,600
I'm not sure what I haven't seen that yet. I don't know whether we covered the vaccine.

516
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:28,300
For me, that probably not. We started to back to Helicobacter pylori.

517
01:01:28,540 --> 01:01:33,340
I'm not sure whether we have a vaccine for digital. I think some people probably would try to develop the vaccine.

518
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,060
According to CDC, there is no vaccine. There's no vaccine. Right.

519
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:42,400
So so that's the other thing or the lack of vaccinology to go about that.

520
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:48,880
Would you just give it to people who will exposed or just everybody in general for this disease?

521
01:01:48,910 --> 01:01:53,440
Think about the incidence rates, the mortality with the population.

522
01:01:53,440 --> 01:02:01,870
I will say if if if this I would say promote to the only to the to the risk populations

523
01:02:02,740 --> 01:02:08,230
recommended is not mandatory like you guys need to give the vaccines now for that.

524
01:02:08,650 --> 01:02:16,719
Okay. Because every exposure most likely will be less. And that way again, we can give you a highly resistant reaction.

525
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:24,730
So also so it's really to the high risk population you want to give the vaccine to them so that will be protected.

526
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:32,280
Okay. If this available sometime gives the vaccine to these folks is not that straightforward.

527
01:02:33,580 --> 01:02:38,080
Okay. It's not really that simple how effective the vaccine is also very questionable.

528
01:02:40,060 --> 01:02:48,580
So really, really the man in the water system is the one system and then protect these risk high risk populations.

529
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:57,490
And that's the way to go. And really, we really need to regulate the the water promises, the water quality, the promises in some way.

530
01:02:58,790 --> 01:03:02,730
And now we're going to have. We don't need to monitor them.

531
01:03:03,330 --> 01:03:14,790
Okay. For example, here in the building, we have more management problems, but we don't really test the water for each of our counterparts.

532
01:03:17,090 --> 01:03:22,200
Zoom is okay if you follow, so that's why it has a CCP.

533
01:03:22,550 --> 01:03:26,570
How does ID assess critical control points?

534
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:35,770
Everybody wants. That's probably what it can do to them to to to to do that.

535
01:03:35,770 --> 01:03:43,980
To show this. Some using real time PCR, some of them just really on the cooling tower in the US.

536
01:03:45,180 --> 01:03:51,360
And basically there's a study, you see that if you really take them all,

537
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:55,040
the queen power of the United States in the in the USA, you'll be able to find.

538
01:03:55,440 --> 01:04:00,790
I mean, we get we get some of them. We find that everywhere we do some of the older ones and find it.

539
01:04:01,090 --> 01:04:08,100
Okay. So they're not as widespread as almost everywhere.

540
01:04:08,130 --> 01:04:16,560
Cooling tower decrease as as as the sea which are the always and the feathering become the hot topic before the COVID and a lot

541
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:24,390
of meetings we're talking about with the with NSF International with Asaf with the National Academy of Science Engineering,

542
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:28,020
we have all these workshops to try to deal with regional outbreaks.

543
01:04:28,290 --> 01:04:36,440
And then the COVID happened. And then we're going to have energy and force people started to cook up US material.

544
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:47,200
But Alvarez Kobe's cool down then I'm pretty sure that he will be become another hot topic in term of the public health in some of this is serious.

545
01:04:49,020 --> 01:04:54,990
Questions. Okay.

546
01:04:56,620 --> 01:05:01,030
So for next week or the next week, it's a monday.

547
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:07,930
You guys will work on your rotation. So we're not missing the cousin.

548
01:05:08,330 --> 01:05:16,990
But you can work out whatever messes you are doing, you or whatever you do to work on the the the project's progression.

549
01:05:17,450 --> 01:05:23,840
Okay. On Wednesday, you'll have the reading materials about the pharmaceutical products in the water.

550
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:28,370
I will provide them reading materials. I will push for probably two or three questions there.

551
01:05:28,580 --> 01:05:36,110
You got to be able to answer the questions. I will use a bigger assignment on the Kevin site.

552
01:05:36,890 --> 01:05:43,550
Okay. I'll provide the reading material for you guys. So that's the the the the for the let's we plan for the next week.

553
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:49,570
Therapist three This week it says on the syllabus. I will open the quiz through.

554
01:05:49,570 --> 01:05:55,280
Squeeze through today. Excuse me. Okay.

555
01:05:57,750 --> 01:06:04,470
And so I will not be able to see you before the criticism of you before the Thanksgiving.

556
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:12,070
Otherwise, happy Thanksgiving. Enjoy. Hopefully I have a good plan, but be prepared for this.

01:06:12,430 --> 01:06:19,720
This Thanksgiving season will be high season for flu, for RSV and the COVID.

558
01:06:19,730 --> 01:06:29,410
And we are so still paying attention to it's better when you have this even with you have more people getting together, wear masks.

559
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:34,400
And so that's one thing you can protect yourself you.
