1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,520
See for yourself. Yes. All right. So let's get started.

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:12,840
And I so know either the date today, so we might finish a little bit early, although I do want to tell you my version of what your questions vaguely.

3
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:16,860
Any general questions of like, how am I doing?

4
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:25,320
And Am I doing stuff or not enough stuff or too much stuff? So right now, as of today, we are exactly one third of the way through this class.

5
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:31,890
So if you have about 200 points right now and then you kind of keep accumulating points at about the same rate,

6
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:41,430
that will give you like 600 points that if you get 80% average on the midterms, which is the class average on the midterms, that's another 400 points.

7
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:45,419
Right. And that if I do, the right adds up to a thousand. Right. So that's a good benchmark.

8
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,380
So if you're wondering like am I doing too many optional things are not enough optional things.

9
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,120
Generally I'd say if you're around 200 points, you're doing five, right?

10
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:00,330
And then you're way below, then that might be a problem. You might get an email from your just new book coming up.

11
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:06,720
If you're at like 500 points, maybe you like the fact that right now just.

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:16,590
Okay, so that's so that's that the other general thing I have and I think I've told most people this anecdotally, if not all together,

13
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:22,080
is if you're looking for study materials, the best to study materials are problem roulette,

14
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:25,200
which has every multiple choice question I've ever written for this class.

15
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:29,490
There are several thousand of them, and every lecture is learning objectives, right?

16
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:33,120
Which are the things I'm staring at when I write the questions for the exam price?

17
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:39,810
If you look for a study guide there, here we have a document that has all the learning objectives in one place, if you prefer that, I will post that.

18
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:44,340
Yeah, in case that's helpful. But that and probably a lot of room.

19
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:51,300
Also, the other thing about probably that for any of you who have used it or not used it or whatever is if you get a question wrong number overlap,

20
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:54,389
you can save that question to your notebook and then bring that to me.

21
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:57,390
Or if you like to be like I'm confused about this question, right.

22
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:08,669
Compared to obviously the question get right, which presumptively you are not be like, okay, that's all I have for general, everyone's worth.

23
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:13,230
Most of the class is above 200 points. I am like, you all may be concerned about how things are going, but I am not.

24
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:16,500
I am totally comfortable with how things are going. You're all you're great.

25
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:24,240
And things are not like, okay, so today we're going to talk about reactive oxygen species and the metals phosphate pathway.

26
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:32,760
This is now pathway number two of glucose metabolism. We're moving on from glycolysis and TCA cycle fuel to the pinnacle of quality control.

27
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,580
So these really briefly in the TCA cycle notes this idea of reactive oxygen species

28
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,780
and then came up in the context of oxygen is the terminal electronic sector mark

29
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,430
you can skip ahead to here are the terminal electron acceptor for the electron

30
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:51,329
transport chain every once in a while and the estimates are somewhere around 2 to 4%.

31
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:56,639
You create this thing called a reactive oxygen species, right? And so reactive oxygen species would be something like that.

32
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:09,959
So this would be oxygen. This would be oxygen, and this would be a superoxide ATP that's got one extra three this on the other side.

33
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:16,200
And so one extra electron, right? So the thought is that the extra electron that is for electron is incredibly reactive.

34
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,829
It's just seeking for other things for it to interact with and bind to.

35
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:24,780
Quite often it's going to interact and bind with things like DNA or Libyans or proteins,

36
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:29,730
and that's going to cause a whole variety of potential problems in metabolism.

37
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,970
And so there's a bunch of different drugs. I is carefully enough.

38
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:39,990
You can price the drugs that are between hydroxyl and rocks, all based on the fact that they all have an extra reactive electron.

39
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:45,150
So we call them reactive oxygen species, but really they should be called like reactive electrons.

40
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:54,180
They just happen to always be carried by oxygen because as you may not be surprised to hear, oxygen is very toxic oxidation.

41
00:03:54,930 --> 00:04:01,290
Okay. So one big place you can get these roses are from the from the termination of electron transport chain.

42
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:06,150
And one reason you might get that is if you have a buildup of a bunch of these reactive intermediates.

43
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:13,559
So any of these are also highly reactive molecules.

44
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:20,219
Any negative, if you have a buildup of those, those might also donate their free electron is going to sound a little bit confusing,

45
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:25,410
but their free electron is now in the form of a hydrogen because that's forming up along with the hydrogen.

46
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:31,799
That's what they need versus anything in this. But if you move those all those intermediates, those might also cause oxygen again, because again,

47
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:38,220
you've got these highly reactive species either burned through it or didn't get to it in class on Monday.

48
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:43,470
But one key thing about the electron transport chain is it does not run on a push mechanism.

49
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:47,450
So just because you have a buildup of these intermediates coming out of the TCA cycle at the edge,

50
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:53,550
and it does not mean that the reaction is going to go for the reaction of the TCA cycle is a whole mechanism,

51
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:56,790
which means it only goes forth when there's energy demand. Right.

52
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:59,700
And you can do this experimentally if you just take a mitochondria.

53
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:03,650
You give it an infinite amount of energy, age, and if any age, nothing will happen at all.

54
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:10,460
But if you give it a little bit of ATP suggesting that there is not enough ATP, then the reaction will go ahead.

55
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:15,770
So think of it as it's being pulled by the lack of energy. Right. So we kind of double back to what I was saying here.

56
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:21,150
If you have a lot of things going through the cycle, but you don't have an energy demand, right?

57
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:25,910
So you've got a lot of nutrients flowing through, but you don't have an ATP depletion.

58
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:33,850
These things are just going to have the feedback and they'll impair the cycle and are nitrogenous, but the reactions won't occur, right?

59
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:37,099
So that might be another case where you can have a buildup of red boxes,

60
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:41,749
because there's a theory out there that the buildup of these reactive oxygen species and

61
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:47,480
their damage of DNA and protein lipid is actually one of the major causes of aging.

62
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:53,300
And you might be surprised by and dubious of this claim because of lack of data, but it is the theory.

63
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,090
Oxidative damage can be quite problematic.

64
00:05:55,100 --> 00:06:01,290
It's probably the leading cause of progression from nonalcoholic fatty liver disease to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.

65
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:05,480
There's actually pretty good data for that. I'm just less convinced that it underlies a lot of the things.

66
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:16,150
But that being said, we have problems with it in terms of what you and your intake being too much energy expending it.

67
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,389
Is that why you see inflammation increasing? Yeah, that's a good example.

68
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,860
Say, for example, methyl. Right.

69
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:28,999
So you're eating too many calories and those extra calories are going through the electron transfer or the glycolysis in that you

70
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,600
see the cycle becoming energy and then just hanging around because your liver is not burning those colors and that can happen.

71
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:37,040
So that's a good example.

72
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:46,970
And there's lots of examples of if you say OVERFEED, a mouse over Calorically, [INAUDIBLE] be a little red box in there, you know.

73
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,750
Yeah, but you may ask, like, why we're, like, intentionally making these things, right?

74
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,020
We could just, like, have a ball to, like, not right.

75
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:00,230
Why would we just create the thing that is going to be damaging ourselves?

76
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:04,040
Wouldn't there be, like, an evolutionary advantage of, like, not creating those things?

77
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:09,140
Like, why don't we just do that, right? So in that they're actually quite useful for some things.

78
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:16,220
So we always generally, first of all, we like to box and this disease we think bad image of why eat your antioxidants, blah, blah, blah.

79
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:21,920
But I'm going to go through a couple examples to start to dispose of what are they're actually sometimes useful.

80
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:26,690
Right. And of course, if they're only not useful, we would just like if all we've got right,

81
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:30,640
these are chemicals that we make in our bodies, fight enzymes in our bodies.

82
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:38,720
They're very easy of not to do that. So are they. So they're generally but it's actually going to give you a couple examples of why they're not okay.

83
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:47,120
So the first example here is an enzyme called any MPH oxidase, which is shown right here.

84
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:55,279
It's got all these different subunits in it. But what it does is it actually intentionally will take any BPH molecules out for off today and it uses

85
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:01,760
the energy gauge to actually create reactive oxygen species in an organelle that they have themselves.

86
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:08,329
So it's basically intentionally creating a bunch of oxygen species. Now the reason it does that is because what these are our cells that engulf some

87
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:13,660
invading bacteria or virus and it's actually trying to kill that bacteria.

88
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:18,890
Right? So it's creating reactive oxygen species pretty effectively to create what's called an oxidative.

89
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:22,710
Right. And that's a major part of our any immune system is coming killing.

90
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:29,870
So you detect something, you're like this salmonella like no bueno and it goes it uses reactive oxygen species kill salmonella.

91
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:33,500
Therefore, you have an immune system. You have an immune system. Right. So that's good.

92
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:36,920
We want that to happen, right? We would not want to avoid that.

93
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:43,220
So that's one one possible benefit, that one to me reasonably straightforward.

94
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:50,600
I'm going to go through a slightly more complicated example here, and that has to do with exercise and the adaptations to physical activity.

95
00:08:51,200 --> 00:09:00,080
And so what what I'm showing you here is the activity of various enzymes, complex one, complex two and complex four, activity pre and post exercise.

96
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:04,990
The details of the exact study, which was a very elegant study from 1967,

97
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,379
which if you're interested in like science studies from before I was born, I thought I'd read.

98
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:15,140
But basically what they did was they exercised some participants lenses from the old wounds and

99
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:19,550
they took biopsies of their muscles to look at what happened to their electron transport chain.

100
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:27,440
And maybe not surprising, what you might find is as people went through a training regimen, they increased their activity.

101
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,860
So they had more mitochondria, as I talked about last week, that hierarchically complex,

102
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:36,870
more complex to complex or complex more presumably now that they were trained to do the running or cycling.

103
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:40,099
I think cycling here now the red. Right, right.

104
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:46,069
Because their mitochondria are more efficient and more able to extract energy from their fuel.

105
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:49,670
Right. So it's a good transition. Right. If you wanted to get better at running, you would do this.

106
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:53,059
Your muscles get better, you get better. That kind of time.

107
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:59,750
Back to what we've talked about, your exercise doesn't necessarily lead to weight loss, but weight management this.

108
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:06,650
It sounds like a silly question, but are the mitochondria that are being trained for running different than those that might be trained for swimming?

109
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:11,889
Because I feel like we talked about like switching up their workout routines,

110
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:15,610
would we make would be more efficient because if you just kept doing the same one,

111
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:19,060
you become efficient and aren't burning or like using as much energy.

112
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:24,890
Okay. So I'm not 100% sure I understand your question. So I'm going to kind of circle back and then we'll see if I get there in the end.

113
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:31,330
So. So you're right. Exercise is not great. So I've said that exercise as a population also does not cause weight loss.

114
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,400
Part of the reason for that is because as you exercise, you get more efficient with your fuel burning.

115
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:39,790
Right. And so efficiency, remember, is going to be the opposite of.

116
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,630
Again, look, we have said that enough times that you all hopefully are convinced.

117
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:47,950
Right. So that's one possibility, right? You exercise more. Now you're working with courage.

118
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:52,269
You may notice this if you say, I haven't gone for a run in several years and you go for a run running block,

119
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:56,340
I might be extremely tired, but then after you've been training for several months, you might be like one third.

120
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,890
And that's because you're like burning calories, which maybe sucks if your goal is to lose calories.

121
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:03,480
But if your muscles are getting better at that, then you're being trained to do okay.

122
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:07,240
So that's that swing versus running when I mean running here, I mean endurance running.

123
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:13,360
So usually when they do studies like this, it's like sort of low to medium intensity on a treadmill for what exactly?

124
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:19,150
So we're not talking about sprinting, which I think maybe is what you're alluding to in terms of differences in muscle fiber types.

125
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:24,710
More swimming and endurance things are roughly the same in terms of it's highly eroded because I guess what I'm saying,

126
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:31,330
I guess I didn't use a good comparison of exercise if it was like two different exercises, I guess, and now I'm thinking about it more.

127
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:35,980
The mitochondria probably aren't the same, but it's more like the muscles that you're using that are utilizing mitochondria.

128
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:39,860
And a lot of it was training. I mean, I obviously I love the vibrancy of my commute.

129
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:47,989
A lot of the training adaptations is actually intervention, intervention like intervention where you're accessing more contractile units, right?

130
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:51,110
To use the muscle more, you get more inner flow and that's a switch for weightlifting.

131
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:57,220
Most of the initial adaptations not to. Okay, good, good clarification.

132
00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:03,680
I'm glad I could go back to my you will hear this like efficiency is purely about a lack of the court decisions.

133
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:08,030
Okay. So I would like to hear back to Tom Lazy.

134
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:11,780
You can see all of these things increase, lots of pain.

135
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:17,270
Turns out this causes there's more mitochondria, right? So we have these training applications. These training applications are really good.

136
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:24,410
So this is another study now for much later, 2009 where basically they're doing the same things, like basically the same kind of study.

137
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:33,379
So they're taking a bunch of people, generally healthy volunteers. In this case, I know for sure it was only guys and they did some training.

138
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:38,360
And what you can see is there are some adaptations that occur, but now it's all the same things with the mitochondria.

139
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,479
So I'm just not showing you that. But there's a few other adaptations out here.

140
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:47,090
So this thing called superoxide dismutase to a look on Broadway, these are like antioxidant enzymes.

141
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:52,399
We'll talk a lot more about these in a few slides, but you can see there's these adaptations, these protein level adaptations.

142
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:57,830
These are transcriptional changes. As I talked about, last five transcriptional meetings are slow but permanent changes.

143
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:02,120
So this is what happens when you when you adapt to exercise.

144
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:07,400
Well, what they did in this study was it it's something sort of interesting, which I would have actually been maybe before they did the study.

145
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,520
Surprised by it. They said, well, what if we give these people a bunch of antioxidants?

146
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:17,000
Right. Because, you know, we all exercise creates all these oxidants because as you burn through more fuel, you're going to burn through more oxygen.

147
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:20,270
Therefore, that 2 to 4% gets to be a bigger absolute number.

148
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:25,070
You create more of that toxicity. So what do we just like? BLOCK That? Is that going to make them like way better exercises?

149
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:31,280
Because like any oxidants are good and stuff, right? And it turns out, no, that actually completely blocks the effects of the exercise.

150
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:35,480
You can see now these antibiotics and enzymes are actually not needed anymore

151
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,750
because you have all of these vitamin C and vitamin E from the supplement.

152
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:47,860
So there was less reactive oxygen stress. So you needed less of an adaptation of your endogenous antioxidant system, right?

153
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:50,920
So that adaptation that occurred in these people did not occur in those people.

154
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:55,700
That's right. You're going to remember, like, sure makes sense. You know, you're getting exogenous antioxidants.

155
00:13:55,700 --> 00:14:02,269
You don't need the energies and toxins makes perfect sense. But the problem is, if you look at their actual training adaptations and in this case,

156
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:07,009
they're looking at insulin sensitivity with insulin sensitivity increasing here you can see the

157
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:11,690
benefits that these people saw for insulin sensitivity were completely blocked by the antioxidants.

158
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:19,249
Right. And this has now been replicated in terms of training adaptations in perfect myocardial number, in forth projection, endurance, VO2 max.

159
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:23,810
All of these things are actually impaired by having dietary antioxidants.

160
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:27,650
All of these things are plot. Right. And this is sort of the summary what they have.

161
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:34,220
Is it for you to have these adaptations you need to have have oxidants come in because that's how the adaptations occur.

162
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:39,710
The muscles are sensing these these reactive oxygen species, and that is how they know to adapt, right?

163
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:44,630
That is how they are learning that, hey, there's a lot of mitochondria are a lot of reactive oxygen species coming around here.

164
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:50,870
I better adapt to make more mitochondria slash, bring in more fuel more effectively slash increase my antioxidant systems.

165
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:58,490
So if you're having an elite athlete train where you actually kind of recommend that they watch how many oxidants they're taking in,

166
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:01,700
or is it just like normal amounts? You just wouldn't want to have them increase.

167
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,089
Okay. So you said Ortiz, which I don't know,

168
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:08,569
getting into sorry what you said that was actually that was actually a really interesting

169
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:12,290
question because if I was training if I was advising somebody about nutrition,

170
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:16,069
which the world has gone to a terrible place, if I didn't, but if I was,

171
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:21,649
I would be like, yeah, there's no evidence you should be taking an antioxidant. And I bet if you just ask general people like, Hey, I'm like running,

172
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:26,060
should I like increase my energy, like vitamins, people be like, Sure, that sounds good.

173
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:30,370
So this is what you guys actually know. That's not good. That's like, not good. There's no evidence that it's good.

174
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:35,870
And in fact, there's plenty evidence that it's actually hurtful. No, I wouldn't go as far as to say, like having a horrible oxygen rich diet.

175
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:38,080
I don't think that's going to get you to the same place either. Right.

176
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:44,690
But I don't think that the idea of supplementing with vitamin C, vitamin E, which is extremely common for high performance athletes, is beneficial.

177
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:50,419
And now we've known this for over 12, 30 years. So this has been we've known this for a while now.

178
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:53,930
What you said in the Misfit, you said, which I think is also interesting question,

179
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:57,290
is, well, could I manipulate this by just feeding somebody oxidants?

180
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:00,770
There are foods that have oxidative capacity, foods that are very reactive.

181
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:05,240
So like fava beans is a very good example. Chloroquine is a drug that is a high time.

182
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:10,129
Will that help your most a lot of patients? I don't know. Maybe there's actually some evidence that that might actually help.

183
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:14,480
People have done studies where they get an athlete's core group, which is antimalarial drug, which we'll talk about in a few slides.

184
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:19,130
And that seems to maybe help with some of that. But it's like the evidence of that is like less strong than this evidence here.

185
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,360
But again, I'm not saying like tell you.

186
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:29,820
So what you're saying is, like, you don't need to supplement because the body is already like taking care of it.

187
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:33,349
Right. So I think that's probably going back to the the first part of that answer.

188
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:37,580
The question is you want these endogenous sensing of strange systems to occur.

189
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:43,100
I mean, anybody who's tried exercise or tried running or tried retrain knows that the harder the thing is, the better you adapt to it.

190
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:47,900
Right. And if you're just like, I'm going to adapt to becoming a marathon runner by like extremely slowly walking to work.

191
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:56,060
It's probably not going to work is what you need to have a strain. And part of that strain is is based on these antioxidants, isn't it?

192
00:16:56,690 --> 00:17:02,150
So if you have something as insulin's diabetic going to just insulin insensitive.

193
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:11,670
You should also avoid extra amounts of vitamin C. I wouldn't go that far because now you start to borderline.

194
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:17,849
If you're insulin resistant, then there's probably a higher risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease,

195
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:25,229
which definitely can be alleviated by dietary supplements. And there is pretty good evidence that you can have damage to the cellular

196
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:29,190
epithelium by reactive oxygen species and that can also impair Google's transport.

197
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:31,410
So for diabetes, I wouldn't say this is true.

198
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:37,590
This would maybe, you know, of the narrow subset of people with diabetes who are training to become an endurance athlete.

199
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:41,190
And what the question is like, what's more important to insulin sensitivity or the adaptation of the muscle?

200
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:46,210
For me, most people who are diabetic, probably the diabetes and the interest rate,

201
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:51,240
but you know, I mean, there's diabetes, diabetic performance out of there, all of this.

202
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:58,020
Okay. So I'm going to give you a kind of another human example here to kind of elaborate on what I'm talking about.

203
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:03,720
So people have been very interested in this question of how do we genetically identify

204
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:10,650
who would be a good if even how do we identify exactly why are some people at risk?

205
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:16,709
So one interesting study that came out of Israel was they were looking at variance

206
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:19,560
in this particular cigaret opposite is the case one of these antioxidant

207
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:29,400
enzymes and they were comparing control people who mostly had a belief in a particular location in their genome to elite power or endurance athletes.

208
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,540
And in both groups they had a lower prevalence of this particular available.

209
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:37,170
Right. So the suggestion was, well, these people became endurance athletes.

210
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:43,980
Maybe they had a better version of saw that helped them become better athletes or something.

211
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:51,140
And so this is another sort of replication study actually. I think it's just in the figures and things like where they looked at sort of top level.

212
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:54,370
So know these are Olympic level athletes versus nationals.

213
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:57,360
So still very good athletes but not quite Olympic level athletes.

214
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:02,700
And they still see this increase in the percent of the alpha gene, which is this phenotype.

215
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:08,879
Right. So it suggests that there is some self-segregation here in terms of the athletes

216
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,350
tend to have this difference in performance and superoxide distribution.

217
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,990
Now, most people this is pretty rare.

218
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:25,280
So the alanine only is, I guess a couple of things is generally more active and the it's generally not that problem, but it varies a lot.

219
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:32,090
So I mentioned a material a couple weeks ago that was like 12% across all moderate.

220
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:38,400
You see this one is like 45% in East Asian, but it's very high in Latino populations and it's roughly average in the Israeli population.

221
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:45,240
That's what they were looking at and I think outside side missing anyway.

222
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:49,079
So what they found here was there was this change, you know, of course,

223
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:56,250
what they probably expect it was it really changes in like like lytic enzymes or like fatty acid oxidation enzymes look for something like that.

224
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,850
It's a little surprising that they found an effect of such a variance.

225
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:08,580
So again, to kind of reiterate, what is missing on the slide that I've got in my head right now is that the alanine in the old is more active, right?

226
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:12,540
So these people have a higher antioxidant capacity, right?

227
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:18,560
And those people have a higher antioxidant capacity are more likely to be a high level have.

228
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:24,989
All right. So that's sort of the nub of what I'm trying to tell you here. So does anybody want to speculate about why this might be the case?

229
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:29,100
Why would having a higher antioxidant activity.

230
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:41,969
Make you a better athlete. Maybe it's sort of like if you have higher antioxidant activity,

231
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:49,050
you can control reactive oxygen species more and then you can recover faster after working out.

232
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,959
Yeah, that's that's good. I was going to say that.

233
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:58,500
And then the other thing that I was going to add was that maybe that oxygen of the oxygen is transferred into it.

234
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:03,270
I'm thinking about the cheese pizza and it's turned into H2O at the end,

235
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:06,300
which then I don't know if that would be put off in sweat or if that's anything really.

236
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:10,500
The peroxide, well, the peroxide is broken down by another enzyme called catalase, so it would be broken down.

237
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:15,569
But yeah, I think that's right. And so the reason I bring this up is what people I think thought when they started looking at genetics

238
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:19,170
of high performance athletes was that they would find a bunch of people that had like better,

239
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:24,360
more efficient metabolic rate, maybe kind of blood flow, things like that.

240
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:29,459
But what almost all of these guys have told us is the thing that dictates whether

241
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:32,550
or not somebody is an elite athlete or not are things that impair recovery.

242
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:40,799
So you is totally correct. These people have higher antioxidant ability, which means they can recover from a training bout much faster,

243
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:47,460
which means they can train much more regularly without injury. And therefore that is probably the distinction why they have this genetic advantage.

244
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:52,740
For measuring this, would you just take a blood sample and you can get you in touch with blood or spit?

245
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:57,420
There's lots of ways to do it. In fact, if you joined the Michigan Genomics Initiative, they will do it for you for free.

246
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:02,189
Are questions that they're measuring, people who are these kind of athletes?

247
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:06,629
There's that chicken and egg question is, are they this way?

248
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:14,370
Because there has been a mutation from. The training or the exercise on the question of DNA.

249
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,940
Well, this came first. And because of that, they were able to train well.

250
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:22,420
They continue to train well because they were doing well earlier in life.

251
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:25,390
Yeah. So. So these are genetic changes. We've had them their entire life.

252
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:31,870
So there are epigenetic changes that are in alignment with this in terms of also superoxide has mutated, but in this case,

253
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:33,960
they were born born of that communication,

254
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:38,650
so they were born with you can imagine they're born with an ability to recover from exercise faster in general.

255
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:42,340
And then throughout their life that has been progressed and the ability like of course,

256
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:47,560
given adequate training and things like that, that they have a higher likelihood of progressing to elite level athletics.

257
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:53,260
If you've ever read the 10000 Hours book by Liars by Malcolm Gladwell, but they didn't.

258
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:55,600
Yeah, he talks a lot about this. Right.

259
00:22:55,620 --> 00:23:01,090
And there's a lot of evidence that it's the training differences as opposed to some innate biochemical advantage,

260
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:04,480
although you could argue this is an innate. Okay.

261
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:09,380
So those are two examples of why we have Ros and why they're important. And if we didn't have those, we would never adapt.

262
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:15,250
Our training and our muscles would be weak and small and we would not get to be able to run away from the same temporary tigers that were chasing us.

263
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:16,600
But of course,

264
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:22,960
all of you probably are more familiar with the idea that there are certain molecules that are susceptible to damage by these reactive oxygen species.

265
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:30,310
Biochemically, it turns out the thing that makes you susceptible to erratic to oxygen species is the presence of a double bond.

266
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:33,730
Right? So if you have a double bond, that allows you to be more reactive.

267
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:41,320
So for example, DNA, I'm sure you all have exactly affected DNA in your mind like I do, but DNA has a bunch of bases that I'm going to do.

268
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:46,629
All right. And all of those are susceptible to to react like some proteins that that belongs.

269
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:52,840
And it turns out it's amino acids, the ones that tend to be more susceptible as well as cysteine, which is highly redox compatible.

270
00:23:53,200 --> 00:24:00,130
But then for lipids, it actually turns out that the lipids that have a lot of fatty acids or a lot of double bonds are actually healthier threads.

271
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:05,709
We usually think of pufas and those which are polyunsaturated fatty acids are the healthier fats.

272
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:08,860
And of course, for cardiovascular purposes they are definitely the healthier fats,

273
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:14,049
but they are also the fats are more likely to react with antioxidants.

274
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:18,190
So if you had a liver that was full of pufas, there is more substrate for that to happen.

275
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:21,700
Saturated fats, if you hadn't have no double bonds,

276
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:26,769
so therefore completely resistant to react to and in fact people with chronic alcoholism, they don't do this anymore.

277
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:31,870
But they used to people with chronic alcoholism that have really, really high reactants in their liver for reasons.

278
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:38,379
We'll talk about it in about 40 minutes. They used to prescribe them butter because it would actually reduce inflammation in the liver because all

279
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:41,650
of those saturated fats replace the polyunsaturated fats and there'll be no substitute for them to do it.

280
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:51,580
They don't do that any more in terms of forcing people. Butter has other not hopeful signs, but it works if those worked.

281
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:56,390
So again, not to say that I would say if somebody has got Nash, they should stop eating coupons because not lots of benefits.

282
00:24:56,390 --> 00:25:00,250
And we'll talk about in the lipid units. Okay.

283
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:06,880
So I don't mean alluding to to kind of throw we've to more or less independent systems for antioxidants.

284
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:13,570
We have an endogenous system these are enzymes that we make whose entire responsibility is to deal with reactive oxygen species.

285
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:19,510
It takes things like glucose interested in. And then there's a series of enzymes that we'll talk about that that take care of that.

286
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:26,290
Right. So that's our endogenous if we ate absolutely no vitamin C or Vitamin E or any other dietary antioxidant,

287
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:29,620
our endogenous antioxidant system will try to take up that role.

288
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:35,679
However, as you can see from the training example I gave, there are crosstalk between these systems, right?

289
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:41,140
So if you consume a lot of exogenous dietary antioxidants, you are less dependent on the first system.

290
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:44,650
So then you sort of don't have this adaptation of the system.

291
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:49,840
So these systems are related. They do similar types of things, but they kind of feedback to each other.

292
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:53,049
Now, of course, it's harder for us to manipulate our intelligence system.

293
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:57,160
Most people vary. It's because they're varying their dietary system. That's easier for you to to vary that.

294
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:04,750
But yeah, so generally as you're more dietary antioxidants, your endogenous anti systems decrease,

295
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:12,050
do they work something, do they compete or do they just need variety and intensity?

296
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:16,389
And so yeah, I really thought about it that way. But you could argue that, yeah, they do compete, right?

297
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:20,290
Because as your body goes down, right. So they certainly respond to each other.

298
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:23,650
So it makes sense. Maybe you can say that they can do one better than the other.

299
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,620
It is one that it's well, I guess it sort of depends. I don't think that's a super satisfying answer.

300
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:37,509
So there's a couple of subtleties here. So the dietary antioxidant and largest antioxidant system is not that great at getting

301
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:42,879
rid of lipids because all of these are water soluble through the mitochondria.

302
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:48,610
So the lipid peroxidation like this, then the entire system doesn't work quite as well for that.

303
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:55,090
Whereas the exogenous system because i e as talk about it is lipid cyborg works a little bit better for that.

304
00:26:56,950 --> 00:27:00,880
And of course they'll be all African-American seeing vitamin E delivered by yours truly.

305
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:10,720
You're working this even if I was still thought about the indulgence doesn't work so there's.

306
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:15,250
Enzymes here, of which I've already referred to solid and superoxide dismutase.

307
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,300
So it's out of the realm of things that make sense or are hopeful.

308
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:27,129
As I saw it, there are two forms on one, which is a copper wiring enzyme, two, which is a manganese, and you didn't require an enzyme.

309
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:37,930
So you can see if it takes free radicals and generates 200% this peroxide, which is less damaging than the free radical, but still pretty damaging.

310
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:42,160
But then that peroxide fortunately can get rid of by an enzyme called Hathaway.

311
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:45,340
Right. So the fuel system side can always kind of work in tandem.

312
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:51,290
They take the rostron peroxide and put this in the peroxides into water, which is, you know, like fun.

313
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:56,259
Right. Or good the. So that's one whole system. The other system is glutathione,

314
00:27:56,260 --> 00:28:03,040
peroxide is which is regulated and it uses a chemical cofactor called bio and

315
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:08,409
it will exchange the reduction of a good file to recover the proxy process.

316
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:15,250
Right. So they still both require side but you can get rid of these reactants with with good if I don't isn't good for oxidase and you can

317
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:23,829
recycle a good file on the oxidized version using reductase and you do that as we'll talk about in a few minutes using an advocate,

318
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:29,080
which is why this is somewhat tangentially a glucose homeostasis lecture, right.

319
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:37,870
So we have these two systems. If you go back to your you can see so that and those are the two enzymes that I was talking about.

320
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:45,790
You may hear of certain chemicals or minerals, I should say, been referred to as antioxidants.

321
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:49,930
So, for example, people quite often say selenium or manganese or copper serve as antioxidants.

322
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:55,510
That's like true but not true that they are actually things that scavenge reactive oxygen species.

323
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:57,040
They are chemical cofactors for me.

324
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:04,989
So if you were deficient insulin in magnesium, selenium, manganese or copper, the most prominent type is oxidative stress.

325
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:09,729
Because you cannot form these reaction for manganese or copper, you won't have the activity.

326
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:12,580
This enzyme, these things will build up. Same with selenium. If you're isolating,

327
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:20,020
you won't be able to recycle and ATP it here so those are they are antioxidants and you don't see it labeled

328
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:26,290
on your choice of interest that like high energy options but it turns out it's something which is like kind

329
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:34,179
of an antioxidant more like antioxidants over so let's the endogenous system this almost all occurs in the

330
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:39,040
mitochondria which is great if you're a cell that is a mitochondria but not super duper helpful for yourself.

331
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:46,870
It does not have mitochondria. The excellent system is vitamin C and E, which provides you familiar with vitamin C.

332
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:52,270
The thing that if you don't have, you get scurvy for like actually totally unrelated to optimum stress reasons,

333
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:56,320
but for many reasons that have already been called in. Synthesis outcome of the protein unit.

334
00:29:57,130 --> 00:30:01,570
These are both molecules that can be can take a peroxide radical.

335
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:08,680
This says this means a lipid perhaps proto radical vitamin E is lipid soluble so to any point works really well.

336
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:13,450
It's scavenging free radicals from hydrophobic things like lipids so it can scavenge those.

337
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:19,839
And then usually vitamin E passes its its free electron off to vitamin C, which is now aqueous,

338
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:24,999
which we can then either excrete or the vitamin C can be regenerated by by good.

339
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,750
Fine. All right. So those are the two main dyes are antioxidants.

340
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:37,870
So I'm going to start with something I mentioned c c is like important and scurvy is bad, but you're not pirates and most people are not deficient.

341
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:45,460
Vitamin C, he is a little more reasonable. So there are some phenotypes are associated with vitamin E, if I'm sorry, I don't want to.

342
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,610
Maybe you are pirates or I would be.

343
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:55,010
Actually, if you're a pirate, let me know. People are more about your work now.

344
00:30:57,290 --> 00:31:00,709
That being said, there are phenotypes associated with vitamin D deficiency.

345
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:08,390
So muscle weakness, loss of muscle mass, muscle wasting, specifically neurological problems, vision problems, blindness, sensory impairment.

346
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:15,290
So being on the field, things are somewhat like diabetes here. And then hemolytic anemia, which is the loss of the iron,

347
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:20,730
but really the loss of red blood cells due to red blood cells slowing and not having very much.

348
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:24,590
So why don't we take a break and know for like 5 minutes or so?

349
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:27,020
Because there's nothing to submit here. Talk this over.

350
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:32,209
Start from the bottom because the first one is kind of easy and try to come up with an explanation of like,

351
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:40,250
what is it about vitamin E slash free radical scattering that may affect vision, anemia and muscle weakness?

352
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:47,520
There's nothing to submit for this because I'm just going to ask for your muscle in my 500 and.

353
00:31:52,540 --> 00:32:11,530
A regulatory. You know, I do hope that you find a way to do that.

354
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:26,620
And most of the time you're standing outside of your center.

355
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:52,550
I think it should be allowed, I think, an opportunity for us to see what we all agree on it.

356
00:32:54,710 --> 00:33:07,330
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's what I was saying.

357
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:35,830
Yeah. The environment is one of the things that we want to do it right now, which is just the opposite of what I was just before.

358
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:46,390
I thought it was time we talked about it.

359
00:33:46,510 --> 00:34:07,780
I had a lot to give myself to explain things and I know people are going to have to be like parliamentary affairs philosophy.

360
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:16,990
I don't think they are gonna change that.

361
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:36,870
Know, I think actually I think that's always the best thing that's going to happen.

362
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:55,060
But it doesn't mean that he's gone. I guess I know how much it should have been.

363
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:13,860
I think you're going to be highly, much more likely to see anything similar, at least it looks like.

364
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:22,420
Yeah. So it was a kind of moment where it's fair to say you said something like mitochondrial.

365
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:30,400
So first of all, it was 100% right.

366
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:33,720
And also in terms of mitochondria, it's a long memory.

367
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:47,200
Oh, maybe as something that maybe they have.

368
00:35:47,560 --> 00:36:09,430
So you're right. I mean, this is insulting because like I said, it's only by accident.

369
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:30,370
Yes, I'm afraid so. So do you think they're like either that or do you think they have a lot of and that's why they're making these,

370
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:35,230
like, crazy ingredients that that requires?

371
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:42,550
Well, yes.

372
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:54,850
So the first £30,000.

373
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:04,520
So like I said, you know, we think of muscle because, you know, sort of, you know, the average in the brain is not great.

374
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:21,520
So I, I just think it's really interesting and I actually do want to talk, but the first two are a little more straightforward.

375
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:35,080
Whatever I go over, the third one is also really cool, but it's almost like the same.

376
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:54,670
You start to say, Like I said, I have to make sure that it's you like, right?

377
00:37:55,810 --> 00:38:04,920
And then she talks about how she had somebody who was only his assistant.

378
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:21,760
You know I think that there has always a is just bothers me.

379
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:33,280
Yes, that's right.

380
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:43,180
Yeah. No, I'm sorry.

381
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:54,390
Yeah, I yeah.

382
00:38:55,370 --> 00:39:11,460
Cause I wish you can make sure that all the parts go out of business.

383
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:20,530
Yeah, you know, so I'm not.

384
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:28,840
I mean, that usually I.

385
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:37,520
I guess that's all it is.

386
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:43,820
What if you read?

387
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:59,980
All right. So I'm happy to hear that.

388
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:16,700
It would be nice to be like this.

389
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:29,630
And then there's something missing out there, which is why these kinds of things happen.

390
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:42,950
And, you know, I talk about triangles, the old guy just said, or whatever you call yourself.

391
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:54,330
I know. Same with the endorsements. I didn't know that was something like 80% of that is like this.

392
00:40:55,980 --> 00:41:02,190
Okay, so I'm back here now. So let's get some of your guys's thoughts.

393
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:05,880
So many of you. I've got a little bit of a hand here.

394
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:12,780
So many of you came to the conclusion that the thing that ties muscle brain and what cells together is something about their mitochondria.

395
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:20,600
The mitochondria is an important part of his answer. Somebody want to maybe take a stab at the muscle weakness and loss of muscle mass or.

396
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:38,660
Well, you're saying how the free or the native systems are going to impact.

397
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:46,680
I mean, like breakdown of, you know, assets within the muscle so that it can impact recovery, just like do exercise.

398
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:51,890
And is it all like your body's immune to something or.

399
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:58,710
Yeah, that and that can cause more muscle weakness than like some responses.

400
00:41:58,830 --> 00:42:02,250
Yeah. So that's, that's great. That is that is totally correct.

401
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:10,800
That is the second half. The usually people don't actually get to the of the answer about the first half, so there's nothing more.

402
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:11,970
So I'll come back to your personally.

403
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:19,800
So there's something about sort of like mitochondrial health that is, is sort of the first cause here in terms of muscle weakness.

404
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:35,340
I know that group over there told me an excellent answer, but they can't because basically because there's less ATP,

405
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:43,200
the mitochondria are active, so they're not able to, I guess, promote muscle growth.

406
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:47,490
Yeah, exactly. So if you damage mitochondria, that's where your energy from.

407
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:52,470
Right. If you have a lot of free radicals that are generated in your mitochondria and those mitochondria damaged,

408
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:57,810
you're going to have less ATP harvesting ability to be a little more dependent on glycolysis, which is not that great.

409
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:05,309
Then the second point, which is also, like I said, both people don't get the second point is that a lot of the a novel ism for

410
00:43:05,310 --> 00:43:08,400
protein synthesis and amino acid biogenesis also occurs in the mitochondria,

411
00:43:08,610 --> 00:43:11,710
right? So the ability to make amino acids and things is also happening.

412
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:15,290
Also something sometimes as we'll talk about in the next year. Okay.

413
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:17,280
So for the for the first part, it's going to recap.

414
00:43:17,790 --> 00:43:24,140
Mitochondria are the source of the free radicals since they're the source and they're also incredibly lipids.

415
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:30,299
If you remember the structure of the mitochondria that I showed the last time, they have all of these like bending moves of a membrane, right?

416
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:32,640
So they have a ton of membrane in your mitochondria.

417
00:43:32,850 --> 00:43:39,150
So that means those membranes are very susceptible to proxy damage because you've got the react buttons and you've got the membrane,

418
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:46,919
they're like in the same place. So therefore you that's a very susceptible organelle compared to, say, the plasma membrane or the nucleus, right?

419
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:54,780
So they're very sensitive to that. And then so in the in question from like 20 minutes ago are endogenous anti-oxidant systems

420
00:43:54,780 --> 00:44:00,210
are really built for lipids lipid it right there are soluble fiber and soluble right.

421
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:06,750
So the only way that we're really good at getting rid of lipid procurements is in general vitamin E, right?

422
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:14,370
Because that's the lipid soluble antioxidant and it's because mitochondria are lipid rich organelles that also in a lot of matter.

423
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:20,020
That's the answer to the first one. To the second one, you may know those are not.

424
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:26,160
But it turns out the cell type, other than muscle and heart that has the most mitochondria in our bodies is actually our neurons.

425
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:30,690
Right? Our neurons have tons and tons and tons of mitochondria and they have that

426
00:44:30,690 --> 00:44:34,140
because they're constantly generating these ATP independent membrane potential.

427
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:40,260
Right. That's how neurons control their fire. Right. They're constantly maintaining plasma and so degrades not more as a ton of energy.

428
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:45,299
If you remember all the way back to lecture number two of like where is our energy being burned?

429
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:48,300
Remember, a lot of that is the brain, right? And that was like independent.

430
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:52,460
If you're paying attention to what I'm saying right now, your brain is always burning a lot of ATP, right?

431
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:58,830
Because it's really using a lot of energy. It's going to want to use the most efficient energy harvesting system, which is that with mitochondria.

432
00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:03,060
So it's the same argument from Iran's using what mitochondria have.

433
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:06,330
A lot of mitochondria need to have an antioxidant system.

434
00:45:07,290 --> 00:45:12,270
Mitochondria are made of lipids, therefore they're more prone to lipid prostate.

435
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:16,139
And so that's why those two seemingly distant organelles are the same.

436
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:20,370
And you'll see this a lot whenever we talk about any kind of mitochondrial damage or any kind of mitochondrial disease,

437
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:23,969
almost without fail, you notice it in the muscle in the brain, right?

438
00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:27,870
So what is the developmental challenge or it is a muscle weakness or muscle failure?

439
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:32,940
Okay. So we want to take a stab at the third one, which also has to do with mitochondria.

440
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:48,410
Red blood cells don't have mitochondria, so the only way they could get rid of oxidants would be vitamin C and E, and they are also full of oxygen.

441
00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:54,490
So not a great time, in fact. So tons of oxygen, which, you know, I'll tell you.

442
00:45:54,950 --> 00:46:02,990
And also don't even have mitochondria. So they don't have any superoxide just in case or catalase or a good how well that factors but

443
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:08,600
they don't have any of the catalase and the and the superoxide is we tried to as Jim said,

444
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:12,890
they are totally dependent on our energy and or exogenous antioxidant system.

445
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:19,520
And again, memory rich, they're basically memory blobs filled of oxygen with with memory.

446
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:21,800
Right. So they're very prone to that, too. So that's why, again,

447
00:46:21,950 --> 00:46:26,719
you notice this a lot in anemia and we'll see a lot of nutritional deficiencies are associated

448
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:31,460
with anemia because there's a lot of particular is of a cell that has survived for a long time

449
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:36,379
is in like the worst environment possible because it's got tons of oxygen down to it and also

450
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:42,500
has like none of the regular support systems like a regular cell would have like a nucleus,

451
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:50,650
lack of mitochondria, microcosms. Okay, so you make me and many people have that great, but I mean, sounds like awesome.

452
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:52,850
We should like have more of it and stuff.

453
00:46:52,970 --> 00:46:59,090
So let's just like supplement people with that and that will make everybody like where we're healthier no further.

454
00:46:59,090 --> 00:47:05,749
That does not happen. So there's been lots of sites there like trying study here that I've done various vitamin E supplementation.

455
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:13,100
Studies in this case are looking at finding supplementation in generally healthy people and they're looking at all cause mortality.

456
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:20,120
So death from like any reason and the presumption was that we think maybe people interviewed by many if we supplement them,

457
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:24,080
then they'll like live longer, healthier lives. And actually, we saw the opposite.

458
00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:30,200
So you can see where the diagram here is a small effect size, but it's only site of vitamin E is harmful side, right.

459
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:33,920
So it actually turns out supplementing vitamin E slightly decreases your lifespan.

460
00:47:35,030 --> 00:47:44,780
I could see some studies, but I don't remember specifics. Is there any ways to excessive antioxidant intake leading to being propagated?

461
00:47:45,350 --> 00:47:49,430
So there have been some suggestions. There's this like reverse oxidant theory, which I've heard.

462
00:47:51,110 --> 00:47:55,160
I currently have like a really hard time figuring out what the heck they're talking about, but I've heard that as an argument.

463
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:59,210
I'm going to kind of come around to that because I think you're right in terms of what the answer is.

464
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:05,180
So you have too much vitamin E, what is that going to do to your intelligence antioxidant system?

465
00:48:06,590 --> 00:48:11,270
It's going to shut it down. Right. And so because you're shutting down your endogenous system now,

466
00:48:11,270 --> 00:48:15,680
things that rely on your energy system want to be very, very effective for the opposite of the training example.

467
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:19,640
And so when people say that there's this reverse oxidative potential, that's what I think is probably happening,

468
00:48:19,850 --> 00:48:25,730
is that you're down regulating your endogenous system in a way that is now outside of our normal regulatory control,

469
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:30,080
and therefore that that system is needed is not very different in different cells.

470
00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:34,550
For example, red blood cells are going to rely on other systems.

471
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:41,540
So generally, and I remember for sure thinking that vitamin competition Taken was going to help people, it's like not that harmful,

472
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:47,839
but you can take it out or you can also maybe make another argument about maybe this would affect frailty and exercise out of patients.

473
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:49,190
Based on the thing I showed you before,

474
00:48:49,370 --> 00:48:55,849
potentially would be a higher risk for some pathogenic infections based on the the oxidative burst I mentioned at the beginning.

475
00:48:55,850 --> 00:49:00,860
Right. So those are all plausible explanation for why it's not beneficial overall for lifespan.

476
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:05,570
It does turn out, though, if you look at subgroup analysis to be particularly beneficial for people with fatty liver disease,

477
00:49:05,690 --> 00:49:07,580
although the diet is pretty weak, there's some effect.

478
00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:12,109
Good for people who smoke and good for people who consume a lot of alcohol and all three of those

479
00:49:12,110 --> 00:49:16,700
cases because they are consuming a diet that is effectively or a lifestyle that is effective,

480
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:19,530
very high in antioxidants because all of those are very low.

481
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:23,930
So there's good evidence that people, for example, that are smoking, that don't quit smoking.

482
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:25,400
You might be a little bit helpful for them.

483
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:36,860
What about individuals like who have anemia, like is vitamin E supplementation helpful if they have that particular type of hemolytic anemia?

484
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:43,190
You can have anemia for like so many reasons, but that particular type of oxygen based hemolytic anemia.

485
00:49:44,510 --> 00:49:49,690
Yeah. So what about things like gravity and like macular degeneration some?

486
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:55,790
So again, there was a thought that this would be helpful. Part of the problem with both interrupting and the macular degeneration is the

487
00:49:55,790 --> 00:49:58,790
damage is done sort of at a developmental level in neurons through really slowly,

488
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:05,660
right? So it theoretically might be preventative, but it's almost definitely not curative in terms of reversing the existing damage,

489
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:12,770
at least not going into like chemo or something where the high like Tamoxifen,

490
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:20,510
very high rate of like neuropathy that maybe prophylactically or taking vitamin E to protect those neurons.

491
00:50:20,870 --> 00:50:27,170
Yeah. So that's so that generally, yes. Also many chemotherapy units are very interesting anyways.

492
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:31,940
So I actually don't know the exact standard of care. Surprisingly, I ought to know the answer to it.

493
00:50:32,570 --> 00:50:36,170
So somebody knows the answer before we get to that, how often are.

494
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:41,390
So many people who were on things that we know where drugs are very highly, often with potency in those cases, that might be helpful.

495
00:50:41,410 --> 00:50:46,390
I've just never seen a state where they compared the two and showed that it had some benefit on chemo.

496
00:50:46,430 --> 00:50:50,270
You have to be very, very careful with the supplements that.

497
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:59,010
Both ways. Right. Although I feel like there's like less of an IAB problem, which is like throwing buttons and stuff.

498
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:07,090
So whereas if it was like some of the drug you were using, it would be somewhat of an important habit.

499
00:51:07,110 --> 00:51:10,770
Don't have too much control. It was like the theme of all of nutrition.

500
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:13,490
It's good to have it. Okay.

501
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:19,319
There's a bunch of other antioxidants you've probably heard of, though, that I've not mentioned here, because as you might have noticed by my,

502
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:25,320
like, pessimism in the in the notes, I'm like not 100% committed any of these actually, like do anything to a major level.

503
00:51:26,010 --> 00:51:29,380
I'm happy to be convinced. Wrong, but it's very, very hard to see that.

504
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:34,950
But so many of these are the things we might see as divergent oxidants are actually antioxidants.

505
00:51:34,950 --> 00:51:44,940
So going back to Elizabeth Talk from one day, she mentioned the irrigation was the thing.

506
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:48,690
Yeah, yeah. No, no, it wasn't like that was the other one was something else.

507
00:51:50,310 --> 00:51:56,070
Anyway, there's the one on the left that had the was an enzyme that germinated brown rice.

508
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:59,100
That's right. Yeah. And that's the antioxidant properties.

509
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:02,819
And they tested this in vitro. They had some cells and they threw peroxide on these cells.

510
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:07,570
And then they also added this thing and it was good. That's like how all of these studies are done, right?

511
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:10,770
We have some cells, we throw some peroxide on it. We also add some lutein.

512
00:52:10,950 --> 00:52:16,460
And these cells. Right. I do not want to diminish or I do want to diminish.

513
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:21,780
I don't want to say that those are not true. Those are true studies. They are correct. They're done and you're going to lose it correctly.

514
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:24,280
But they are done in cells. Right.

515
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:30,840
Where I quibble with is, are we sure this actually affects oxidant stress in vivo, given that we have a lot of antioxidant systems in our body?

516
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:35,339
And while these are antioxidants, almost all of them are way, way, way, way, way worse.

517
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:40,440
And I'm talking about like a factor of a million worse than vitamin C, which we almost all have plenty of.

518
00:52:40,770 --> 00:52:43,260
Right. And so there may be some marginal benefit for some of these.

519
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:50,280
And included posted an article on a perusal about a cohort study that showed diets that are high in antioxidants had less.

520
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:59,620
I forget what the outcome was. Every one is an exact function.

521
00:52:59,630 --> 00:53:03,170
I don't want to hold hands.

522
00:53:03,650 --> 00:53:06,710
Yeah. So that makes sense. I also don't want to put up with that. It's fine.

523
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:10,430
The problem is that the cohort study and people are consuming more vegetables are

524
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:14,000
like healthier as per like literally everything else we've ever study in nutrition.

525
00:53:14,210 --> 00:53:20,870
So so it's a little hard to say for sure. That was because the idea was actually I was surprised when I was like trying to sleep and yeah,

526
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:25,880
of course, I presume this is also very hard to find a study that's done in humans.

527
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:32,060
Yeah. And the problem with this kind of study is not that well, it's hard to find a study, but it's also it's not hard to do that study.

528
00:53:32,150 --> 00:53:37,639
Right. Like you can give people vitamin E or vitamin C or or you can give them and they have effects or not.

529
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:42,290
But you also give people blueberries or whatever. Right. And then be like, does your diabetes go away when you have liver?

530
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:49,520
And trust me, the blueberry would love for that to be true. Right. Or the BlackBerry or Lisa Rose aren't even that hard to do at an archetype level.

531
00:53:49,790 --> 00:53:54,379
I'll also give you a practical biomarker, because you can measure peroxidation of, say, blood cells or or circulating packets, right?

532
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:57,500
So you don't even need to follow them for 50 years to figure out if they don't get cancer.

533
00:53:58,370 --> 00:54:04,759
But as I said, there's not a lot of evidence outside of cohort studies that these are generally benefit, but they are taking the antioxidants.

534
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:07,430
And I'm just putting on the structures up here.

535
00:54:07,430 --> 00:54:11,060
Please do not memorize any of these structures just to show you that all of a sudden you get a lot right.

536
00:54:11,090 --> 00:54:16,790
That's what makes sandboxes about and simple. Want to compare summaries. So like, it's a good like summary here.

537
00:54:16,790 --> 00:54:19,610
Like our body is still like in a normal scenario,

538
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:27,770
like our body is pretty good at handling oxidative species and like supplementation is not necessary if we're not smoking,

539
00:54:27,770 --> 00:54:31,850
not drinking, that sort of thing. Like, is that a fair blanket statement?

540
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:36,649
Yes. Yeah, I think that's. I think the evidence of, you know, Linus Pauling,

541
00:54:36,650 --> 00:54:40,729
who was a famous chemist who won Google Prize in the fifties, was like super into like minded and was like,

542
00:54:40,730 --> 00:54:45,170
everybody should be taking tons of getting into the environment is going to cure all of disease and like, totally not.

543
00:54:45,710 --> 00:54:50,660
And so, yeah, if you're eating a diet that is generally balanced, then generally your body,

544
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:53,510
if it's working correctly, can usually handle the optimal stress it has.

545
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:59,090
And you point out a couple of really good examples of why this might not be the case, like smoking war or chronic alcoholism or disease.

546
00:54:59,090 --> 00:55:04,970
Right. Like various diseases. Also, I feel like there is having a diet that is generally balanced,

547
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:13,340
especially since I was I had submitted an article for highly processed foods and apparently 62%

548
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:21,080
of the foods in the database of commonly consumed foods qualify for hyper palatable foods.

549
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:27,710
So I guess it's my point is that it's difficult to reach that balanced diet.

550
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:32,230
Yeah, you're right. And, you know, especially as diets get processed and you know, we German, for example,

551
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:35,330
has a lot of vitamin D, but if you're not eating the of the wheat, you're not getting that.

552
00:55:35,350 --> 00:55:37,670
But it's not going to change in our diets.

553
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:45,110
The thing is, though, many of these things that are specifically focusing on C and E are pretty easy to get.

554
00:55:45,470 --> 00:55:50,210
Like there are I would argue that there's almost nobody in America that we know of that's not a pirate.

555
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:55,100
That is like. Right. Like the RDF currency is so low and not put.

556
00:55:55,350 --> 00:56:01,880
The atmosphere is so high. And even if you don't, you can get, like, a gram of it and like all of those like annoying tasting vitamin C, right?

557
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:04,999
So it's like it's got a lot of evidence that that has been helpful.

558
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:10,909
And again, it's like, wait a minute, if I told you I am better now, that life's been trying to say that, but I know that, right?

559
00:56:10,910 --> 00:56:17,570
Because most of us are getting enough vitamin C in beta. And again, my change, I was I want to be like a little bit.

560
00:56:19,990 --> 00:56:24,910
I'm trying to think of a word that is the opposite of what I usually am, a little bit sort of sympathetic to the argument that there might be certain

561
00:56:24,910 --> 00:56:31,060
conditions that are or are actually better treated by these more unique antioxidants.

562
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:38,140
So like, for example, as you can see, turmeric has a structure that kind of looks like beta carotene, which is like vitamin A, but not quite the same.

563
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:40,640
Maybe it does have a specific niche that we just don't know. Right.

564
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:45,840
Like maybe it's excellent for like look, for example, and we just not studied it in that context, right?

565
00:56:45,850 --> 00:56:48,490
Because a lot of these studies are looking at larger things like all cause mortality,

566
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:53,170
more narrow things like what is the best thing for like fingernail upsetting stress.

567
00:56:55,870 --> 00:57:00,210
I have a question about the final design because you see a ton of stuff about being like

568
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:06,170
a master antioxidant and you should take it as a supplement and see if you see a lot.

569
00:57:06,310 --> 00:57:10,360
I like health influencers so much.

570
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:17,709
Doctors. Is it more damaging to potentially take that if that is, again, one of our androgynous ones?

571
00:57:17,710 --> 00:57:23,010
And if we're taking it, then the indigenous system is not doing its job. So I would pretty well be pretty blunt about this.

572
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:28,480
There is no evidence that consuming dietary violence has any effect on anybody

573
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:33,970
because we probably break it all down and it turns out it's just an argument.

574
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:37,000
So yeah, so I would say that's also encouraging.

575
00:57:37,450 --> 00:57:43,179
Having more good advice and in general is good, but there's no link between you eating it and it getting in your body just like,

576
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:46,490
you know, you could consume lots of sucrose and hopefully you're also going to block collagen.

577
00:57:46,870 --> 00:57:49,650
Collagen. Excellent example. Another good example, Logan.

578
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:55,000
So how would you work with a firearm in a psych exercise and make your mitochondria stronger?

579
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:59,910
Yeah, I mean, if you could get better functioning to found in your muscles, that would be great.

580
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:03,520
I'm just saying the way to do that is almost certainly not by diet, right? Yeah, that's right.

581
00:58:03,910 --> 00:58:07,420
What are we doing for what we are?

582
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:11,770
Okay, so there is a sort of, you know, it's what I was telling Disney.

583
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:15,660
I was like, hey, we don't have to do that. So I can just like ramble on about stuff.

584
00:58:15,670 --> 00:58:20,230
I mean, of course I'm going to end up being behind anyways, so we're not going to do this.

585
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:21,970
If you want to do this, you can.

586
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:30,459
This is an activity where if you want to look up foods that are high in these vitamins, minerals to do so, look it up in the USDA food database.

587
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:33,890
That's the link. And then enter your data on a spreadsheet. That's the whole activity.

588
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:36,800
It's just don't look it up if you have that a food of the day or you're planning on doing it.

589
00:58:36,810 --> 00:58:44,110
But it's a good excuse to like get familiar with the USDA food database. We will be doing this again many times this semester.

590
00:58:44,470 --> 00:58:52,090
Okay, so you're gonna like almost an hour and I've not mentioned the word glucose yet, so this is hypothetically a glucose metabolism lecture.

591
00:58:52,090 --> 00:58:55,640
So let's get to the pencil specific chunks and the role of units.

592
00:58:55,690 --> 00:59:01,149
So as I've alluded to, good form or as I recall, the two good that is, like I mentioned, master antioxidant, right?

593
00:59:01,150 --> 00:59:04,900
So that's a vital factor that is easily reduced and easily be charged.

594
00:59:04,990 --> 00:59:08,860
So you can kind of think of it as our first defense against any kind of oxidant stress.

595
00:59:09,370 --> 00:59:10,400
It goes through, you know,

596
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:19,990
conversion between a reduced and oxidized for or human oxidation because if I put my bonds right there and it is made by our bodies,

597
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:29,049
by the combination of these three amino acids, by synthase, that means that the and glycine, two of which are non or sorry or dispensable amino acids.

598
00:59:29,050 --> 00:59:33,010
So we generally can make plenty of glutamine or glued down if we need it, right?

599
00:59:33,010 --> 00:59:38,650
So if we have a good amount of gases, G, we are able to burn a lot of antioxidants.

600
00:59:38,860 --> 00:59:42,570
Now, where this matter matters is we recycle that using energy, right?

601
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:52,239
So the Navy age is the thing that allows us to recycle that and hopefully it will surprise you is coming from glucose, right?

602
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:57,010
So this is the second break of our very glucose six phosphate tree which you talked about.

603
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:03,189
K one this is beautiful six phosphate drugs and the one and only regulatory enzyme in this entire pathway.

604
01:00:03,190 --> 01:00:05,950
This pathway is long and complicated and it's like a gazillion steps,

605
01:00:05,950 --> 01:00:09,999
but there's only one stands right at the beginning is a good around six phosphate

606
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:15,430
hydrogens there's a few key products the pencils phosphate pathway opportunities purposes.

607
01:00:15,430 --> 01:00:19,600
The most important one is any deep age not any age.

608
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:28,150
And ABH, this is what distinguishes it as its role as an antioxidant basically without it is important for of things like blood cells.

609
01:00:28,330 --> 01:00:34,209
It is also as we'll talk about important fatty acids biosynthesis and that is mainly occurring in the liver,

610
01:00:34,210 --> 01:00:36,700
in the fat, which are the two major slices for that.

611
01:00:37,630 --> 01:00:42,670
So that's where we're taking the energy gains from that happens like that, one of this one pathway.

612
01:00:42,790 --> 01:00:46,160
So you make your energy for for glucose toxic.

613
01:00:46,780 --> 01:00:52,000
And then depending on what goes on, you may have a demand for sugars, which means you divert the products this way.

614
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:58,720
These are very ribose sugars. These are for DNA and RNA or you may not need those and you want to use these products for glycolysis.

615
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:05,470
And so depending on how this pathway goes with the cell needs, does it need more ribose phosphate or does it need more energy?

616
01:01:05,470 --> 01:01:09,640
It'll divert the rest of the metabolism this way or that way.

617
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:13,830
And these are all equilibrium steps which mean they're generally not requisite.

618
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:17,439
Arrival sugars are particularly important for really rapidly dividing cells,

619
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:24,249
so a solid divides has to replace all 6,000,000,000 billion with a bases of DNA.

620
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:28,870
All which part in my case. So they need a lot of nucleic acid.

621
01:01:28,870 --> 01:01:36,940
Some cells that are relevant here are bone marrow cells, skin gastro intestinal epithelial cells, which we have a hot list and skin cells.

622
01:01:37,130 --> 01:01:41,650
Right. So they all turn over really, really quickly. Those cells, if you have presenti in the controls, possibly,

623
01:01:41,650 --> 01:01:46,719
perhaps you'll notice that first in those cells because they are the ones that need to make the most of the

624
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:54,820
other cells are going to generate DNA and kick the rest of the sugar back to that causes fatty acid synthesis,

625
01:01:54,820 --> 01:01:58,930
which will have a whole class on in the unit, consumes quite a lot of energy.

626
01:01:59,350 --> 01:02:05,560
So to make a single fatty acid, you need to use a whopping 14 any BPH to make one fatty acid.

627
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:10,120
So here is all that is like interested in making fatty acids. You better have a good supply of energy.

628
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:17,300
So if you imagine the metabolism of. So that cell is going to be using up a lot of their glucose just to make any BPH.

629
01:02:17,470 --> 01:02:24,370
Right. It can be diverting a lot of glucose that ran through. If you look at fat cells or depending on the conditions, liver cells or adrenal cells,

630
01:02:24,370 --> 01:02:29,020
all of which make a lot of the things they are using most of their glucose to actually make any.

631
01:02:29,770 --> 01:02:35,980
And then they're relying on other things like amino acids and fatty acids to make to make energy.

632
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:42,920
So there's a huge demand for energy. For instance, the sun, again, this will come back later.

633
01:02:43,780 --> 01:02:50,270
Okay. So regulation pretty straightforward. One enzyme G six, it is regulated by any BPH and ATP, right?

634
01:02:50,290 --> 01:02:54,819
So it's the things that makes regulate it and that's it. So it's a pretty simple system.

635
01:02:54,820 --> 01:02:59,950
If you have demand of energy, you go down this pathway. If you have an excess of that ADP, you will not.

636
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:07,240
And so that's the super complicated biochemistry of the petals phosphate pathway G6 page, as I mentioned,

637
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:16,240
PSA one and very shortly mentioned for a that this is a deficiency that has an interesting phenotype.

638
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:21,430
Now there's actually a reasonably common deficiency of G six PD H deficiency.

639
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:25,360
It's actually 4.6% worldwide, 20% in sub-Saharan Africa.

640
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:28,839
So that's what the green here is showing the prevalence of this particular mutation.

641
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:32,170
So there's some regions, the world this has a ton of other indications.

642
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:39,639
As I noted, 46 H is very susceptible to oxidant red blood cells, motifs are very susceptible to oxidant damage.

643
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:46,000
And there's a long history here. So Pythagoras, he first identified this question of, like they called it, badness.

644
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:50,170
I mean, he knows that certain people eat fava beans, had a real bad time.

645
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:51,940
Now, he didn't know what hemolytic anemia was.

646
01:03:51,940 --> 01:03:57,909
But that's what that's what it was, was that people were consuming fava beans and they were becoming very tired.

647
01:03:57,910 --> 01:03:59,830
And it was because they were becoming anemic,

648
01:03:59,830 --> 01:04:08,040
because the oxygen stress in the red blood cells was unable to be combated by the lack of activity in these these people that, it turns out,

649
01:04:08,050 --> 01:04:13,930
is because other beans contain dietary oxidants, so they contain chemicals in them that are very oxidized,

650
01:04:14,290 --> 01:04:18,250
which means you eat them and your body has to deal with these very oxidizing chemicals.

651
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:22,700
There's other foods that have oxidized and they're mostly there of inflammatory variety flags.

652
01:04:23,650 --> 01:04:31,530
A couple of fun facts about them is that it is X-linked, which means that it has important gene sex interactions, right?

653
01:04:31,540 --> 01:04:36,580
Because if you re manually have one copy of this, it's more likely to have zero copies of the mutation.

654
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:43,670
It seems the argument is that there's positive selection because you may be like, why is this gene that is like bad and meets you like not.

655
01:04:43,690 --> 01:04:46,149
You can have this other means prevalent in Africa.

656
01:04:46,150 --> 01:04:54,370
And that's because it turns out this gene also gives you some resilience against malaria, which again is very common in sub-Saharan Africa.

657
01:04:54,610 --> 01:05:00,670
But to make things like quite problematic, the number one drug for treating malaria is Paraguay, which is itself an organism.

658
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:05,650
So if you are in this region and you want to take an anti-malarial, you will probably be an American,

659
01:05:05,890 --> 01:05:09,250
which you will then not be able to tolerate because you have famine. Right.

660
01:05:09,250 --> 01:05:16,090
And so you may not be surprised to hear that genetic testing in sub-Saharan Africa is not complete or not very effective.

661
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:19,540
So usually it's based on careful monitoring of symptomology.

662
01:05:19,570 --> 01:05:22,600
Right. But it's kind of like a double burden for this particular group of people.

663
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:26,049
Right. So they are burdened with malaria, the drugs to treat malaria.

664
01:05:26,050 --> 01:05:32,160
They are also susceptible to those. Right. Because, again, Chloroquine and Cohen are very simple.

665
01:05:32,350 --> 01:05:40,960
And if you're more well, I had a nice trip on my appraisal talking about this and how it's actually treated in practice.

666
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:43,780
So it turns out it's can be a problem. Okay.

667
01:05:43,780 --> 01:05:52,270
So after you've met independent, like I said, you kick out your sugar to the rivals or to glycolysis in the form of glycerol the high three phosphate.

668
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:58,030
And you have okay so two of these three things we've now covered.

669
01:05:58,030 --> 01:06:05,379
So we talked about whether or not the decision to go through glycolysis is mediated primarily by also fructose kinase number one,

670
01:06:05,380 --> 01:06:11,230
which is regulated by all of these things. Whether you go through the pencil phosphate chunk is regulated by this.

671
01:06:12,130 --> 01:06:18,760
On Monday we'll talk the glycogen and how this is related, regulated by the synthase and those things, right?

672
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:25,569
So given this constellation of information, you should be able to kind of predict where glucose would go depending on conditions, right?

673
01:06:25,570 --> 01:06:33,160
So I told you, imagine yourself and you've got tons of any deep but also any you should be able predict that you're going to go down the pedal,

674
01:06:33,170 --> 01:06:38,290
possibly with or without glucose, you're going to meet that particular server's.

675
01:06:39,220 --> 01:06:46,820
Okay, so we are going to finish off today with alcohol metabolism, even our very brief diversion into that.

676
01:06:47,290 --> 01:06:51,340
So there really two main ways of alcohol metabolism.

677
01:06:51,940 --> 01:06:54,519
One is probably more common, one that people are more familiar with.

678
01:06:54,520 --> 01:07:01,510
There is an enzyme called 88, which is alcohol, dehydrogenase, followed by another enzyme which is called acid aldehyde dehydrogenase.

679
01:07:01,690 --> 01:07:02,560
Those are pretty effective.

680
01:07:02,570 --> 01:07:10,030
We can get the ethanol to a cell line acid and then eventually some way, some way it can be added to the cycle, just like any other sort of way.

681
01:07:10,210 --> 01:07:18,880
You also get the benefit of generating. A couple of an NDA is on the way so this is actually pretty energy useful.

682
01:07:18,890 --> 01:07:25,160
Sounds like not the right word but energy producing right. So you generate 14 atpase for every molecule of ethanol if you do the math.

683
01:07:25,430 --> 01:07:30,380
And if you go back to our friend Atwater from lecture number two,

684
01:07:31,190 --> 01:07:41,160
that is why alcohol has a much higher calorie content than generating all these effective energy containing models like energy and and a subtle way.

685
01:07:41,210 --> 01:07:46,010
Right. So theoretically, you could get your calories from, of course, being the side effects of that.

686
01:07:46,310 --> 01:07:51,830
So the other pathway and this happens when people consume a lot of alcohol and are generally chronic alcoholics.

687
01:07:51,830 --> 01:07:56,479
And the induction of this pathway, of course, varies from person to person is similar looking, but different.

688
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:59,930
And a couple of I think pretty interesting respects.

689
01:07:59,930 --> 01:08:06,319
So the main difference is at some point your idea is not able to keep up with the supply of ethanol.

690
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:14,510
So instead of using any age, use a enzyme called cytochrome p450 as form e one and it does a similar thing to generate acetaldehyde.

691
01:08:14,510 --> 01:08:18,590
And so from this Acetaldehyde site on, it's the same thing. And LDH is generally never very limiting.

692
01:08:18,860 --> 01:08:22,999
But the big difference is here is if you're using the SIP for you,

693
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:32,240
certainly one system here and so generating the somewhat useful energy containing any age, you're actually depleting your any BPH, right?

694
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:36,559
So you're using up your energy resources to get rid of this ethanol, right?

695
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:42,980
So you can do it. But it comes at a cost, right? It comes at a cost because now you are more susceptible to opposing stress for two reasons.

696
01:08:43,220 --> 01:08:48,320
One is you're using up the antioxidant here so this now can go on and regenerate on.

697
01:08:48,470 --> 01:08:52,820
But then the other reason is you're generating all this acetyl koy and anything which in it of

698
01:08:52,820 --> 01:08:57,350
itself has to go through the electron transport chain and the cycle to generate more things.

699
01:08:57,350 --> 01:08:59,440
That's going to create even more damage, right?

700
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:05,000
So your liver and all of this happens in the liver because all of the ethanol metabolism in general occurs in the liver.

701
01:09:05,390 --> 01:09:12,200
The liver is faced with, if it can keep up with this somewhat useful pathway, has convert to this much, much more problematic pathway.

702
01:09:12,380 --> 01:09:16,220
And therefore you're using up antioxidants and you're generating a lot of lipids because

703
01:09:16,220 --> 01:09:20,480
you're generating a lot of a subtle and presumably if you're consuming all alcohol,

704
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:23,810
you're not currently also burning a lot of calories at the exact same moment.

705
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:32,840
So that is the difference between nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, you know, and alcoholic beverages.

706
01:09:33,650 --> 01:09:39,500
So those is really, really similar. You normally start with the generation of fat in the liver that's coming from this way, which is coming with it.

707
01:09:40,070 --> 01:09:45,080
Over time, you're going to get some inflammation scarring that is probably due to oxidative damage due to the

708
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:50,299
induction of the CYP one system over time that condemned cells enough that they become scarred,

709
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:56,750
which is results in cirrhosis and then in some cases to acellular carcinoma, the pathology similar to exactly the same,

710
01:09:56,750 --> 01:09:58,580
the source of the fat is a little bit different here,

711
01:09:59,150 --> 01:10:03,680
but I think an underappreciated aspect of this is we spend a lot of time, especially in rodent studies,

712
01:10:03,890 --> 01:10:07,640
studying alcoholic, fatty liver disease and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease,

713
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:11,750
as if a single person can either be obese or drink alcohol but can never do both.

714
01:10:12,020 --> 01:10:16,580
And it turns out people can actually people people can't be overweight and can also consume alcohol.

715
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:23,570
So right now, even though liver disease historically when people needed a and stage liver transplant was because of alcohol,

716
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:28,790
alcoholism, now it's more common due to due to obesity.

717
01:10:28,970 --> 01:10:32,420
But alcohol is still a major contributor because the pathology is so similar.

718
01:10:32,510 --> 01:10:38,540
And in fact, there's pretty good data now going back to mice that if you are a fatty liver from diet related reasons and you add that alcohol,

719
01:10:38,540 --> 01:10:43,880
you are more synergistically likely to develop and stage fatty liver.

720
01:10:44,330 --> 01:10:48,440
So this is again a major health problem, something like 20% of people, not just obese people,

721
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:55,159
20% of people have some level of fatty liver disease is hard to diagnose and there is zero FDA approved drugs to treat this.

722
01:10:55,160 --> 01:11:01,790
So it's both hard to diagnose bad and hard to treat, which is sort of do they typically diagnose is a biopsy usually.

723
01:11:01,970 --> 01:11:04,160
So the goal center. Well most people get initial blood draw.

724
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:08,569
You're looking at their nails here at East Levels and then if that is bad enough, they get you always do biopsies.

725
01:11:08,570 --> 01:11:14,719
Now that last part is like ultrasound type extent, sometimes biopsies,

726
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:23,350
but now usually the last artificial get that most people to doctor don't get that at least at Michigan medicine hepatologist.

727
01:11:24,650 --> 01:11:30,500
Okay. So alcohol consumption is actually interesting for sort of another bias that's typewritten,

728
01:11:30,710 --> 01:11:36,140
which is that the distribution of alcohol consumption is wildly, wildly not normally distributed.

729
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:40,340
So, for example, 50% of everybody in the world consumes zero alcohol at all.

730
01:11:40,460 --> 01:11:42,800
Right. So they are all zero, right.

731
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:49,220
But then if you look at the top 10% of alcoholics sorry, top 10% of people who consume alcohol, so it's 10% of the population.

732
01:11:49,220 --> 01:11:54,200
So we're talking like 30 million Americans are consuming quite a lot of alcohol.

733
01:11:54,290 --> 01:11:59,840
Right. And so they're consuming on average, what, at the same p 74 drinks per week.

734
01:11:59,930 --> 01:12:06,230
So a little over ten drinks per day. So 30 million people on this time and drinks today.

735
01:12:06,470 --> 01:12:11,840
No, I think is kind of in jest. But I want to be honest with you, I have very rampant alcoholism and.

736
01:12:12,010 --> 01:12:17,810
My family. And I remember when I first saw this, I was caught teaching this with Liv Anderson and she was like, there is no way that this is right.

737
01:12:17,830 --> 01:12:23,140
That is crazy. I was like, You should be my dad. Like, maybe I would be like, I'm good.

738
01:12:23,380 --> 01:12:31,210
It would be like, I got to do stuff. Today would be Hendrix. And so people, I think, don't appreciate how much chronic alcoholics drink.

739
01:12:31,330 --> 01:12:36,760
Right? This is not a small amount. If you add up the 14 grams per drink times 74 drinks.

740
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:40,620
That is an astounding number of calories. Right.

741
01:12:40,630 --> 01:12:44,910
So like that is why many alcoholics also suffer from co-morbidities associated with obesity.

742
01:12:44,990 --> 01:12:51,910
Right. So you have to be very cautious about this. Another problem problem challenge with alcohol is if you're a dietitian and you're asking, say,

743
01:12:52,090 --> 01:12:57,820
chronic alcoholic how much you drink, they will probably like you, like my dad will be like, hey, no, I'm not eating it.

744
01:12:57,970 --> 01:13:03,760
Like, why are there like 20 of these? I was here yesterday. I'm like, oh, well, those that's like 20.

745
01:13:03,940 --> 01:13:09,460
So it's like you're drinking. So anyway, so you have to be very cautious about this and there aren't good biomarkers at all.

746
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:16,630
Now, for decades, people said, oh, it's not a big deal because, you know, one or two glasses of alcohol per day is actually maybe good for you.

747
01:13:16,870 --> 01:13:20,679
And they were basing that on data like this where they were looking at cardiovascular mortality.

748
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:24,370
And what they would find is that it turned out people were consuming in this case,

749
01:13:24,370 --> 01:13:28,959
as if I'd average 1 to 2 drinks per day, had it lowered cardiovascular risk.

750
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:34,450
And that led to all sorts of like garbage science about like special properties in wine or making people better.

751
01:13:34,630 --> 01:13:37,990
It just turned out they were like a little bit wealthier and had better access to health care and.

752
01:13:37,990 --> 01:13:40,990
All right. There was no special benefit of wine.

753
01:13:41,110 --> 01:13:45,910
Now, there is still this reduction. We still see this in prospective cohort studies in terms of of the reduction,

754
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:52,690
so that currently the USDA recommends the alcohol intake limit is one or two drinks per day for men and one drink for a woman,

755
01:13:53,230 --> 01:14:00,370
presumptively based on body size, not sexism. And that's based on the kinds of these kind of cohort studies here.

756
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:05,530
But to be clear, if you look at all cause mortality, it's not just cardiovascular disease, all cause mortality.

757
01:14:05,740 --> 01:14:10,570
There is no level of alcohol intake which is beneficial to you in terms of like legs.

758
01:14:10,810 --> 01:14:13,900
Right. There is no beneficial dose. I want to make that extremely clear.

759
01:14:14,050 --> 01:14:18,260
There may be doses where there's not that much of an effect, but there is no good amount of alcohol.

760
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:22,420
Alcohol is a toxic period. It is something our body has to detoxify.

761
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:25,390
There is maybe good social reasons to consume alcohol.

762
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:30,490
There is no good biological reason to consume what you are putting your body through something that it has to detoxify.

763
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:37,240
That is always not going to be. Now, once you get up to here, 200 grams per week, that's one or 200 divided by 14.

764
01:14:39,470 --> 01:14:42,770
Seven eight. Is that right?

765
01:14:42,830 --> 01:14:46,940
So that's where things start to become really problematic. And of course, it increases it increases beyond that.

766
01:14:47,810 --> 01:14:51,230
And then just for sort of reference here, you may wonder what is a drink?

767
01:14:51,380 --> 01:14:52,790
Like, what is a standard drink?

768
01:14:52,820 --> 01:15:00,100
It turns out a standard brings to mind is 14 grams of ethanol, which is sort of these sizes of your of your beverage of choice.

769
01:15:00,110 --> 01:15:05,440
Right. So the overall increase starts around seven drinks per week, which is like right around here, right?

770
01:15:05,450 --> 01:15:09,350
So that's around where we know things are starting to become problematic, etc.

771
01:15:09,770 --> 01:15:16,040
And there's again no good evidence control for socioeconomic status that any particular time of all is like better or worse than you,

772
01:15:16,100 --> 01:15:19,370
despite what people who think that red wine is some magic potion.

773
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:27,040
So like biochemically wise, drinking worse and like, like having seven drinks in a night versus seven drinks over a day.

774
01:15:27,050 --> 01:15:30,160
Like, is it the build up, the faster build up of that.

775
01:15:30,260 --> 01:15:31,100
Yeah. Right.

776
01:15:31,100 --> 01:15:39,409
So if you're a girl and say my dad plays a lot of set, do we want so he if you're consuming a lot of it once you're using mostly the system, right.

777
01:15:39,410 --> 01:15:44,479
So this system has a capacity to it. If you have, you know, a glass of wine with dinner or something, you're probably mainly using this, right?

778
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:50,959
But if you're drinking 24 of of floors and on a Saturday night, most of that is probably going to be right.

779
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:55,340
And it's that quick build up of oxidants because of the reduction of the antioxidants, that is.

780
01:15:56,180 --> 01:16:02,180
And that's why binge drinking is bad. But binge drinking is also bad for like other psychological sociological reasons as well.

781
01:16:02,180 --> 01:16:07,850
But in terms of health, that's why it's if you were to scale it and be like, is it better to drink seven drinks in one day or one drink or seven days?

782
01:16:07,850 --> 01:16:11,900
If you watch a one year course on this and some drinks on Saturday and.

783
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:17,490
