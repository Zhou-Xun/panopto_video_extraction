1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,371
Hey everyone.

2
00:00:03,371 --> 00:00:07,420
This is the bio synthesis or synthesis.

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:08,470
Quick review.

4
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:10,040
Video.

5
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:10,941
So PKU.

6
00:00:10,941 --> 00:00:15,431
We said you lose the it means that's a disease that's an inherited disease.

7
00:00:15,431 --> 00:00:19,181
Inborn error of metabolism by which you cannot make tire scene from fennel Ellen.

8
00:00:19,181 --> 00:00:23,817
And and so the babies need to be on the final l need free formula because can

9
00:00:23,817 --> 00:00:25,200
build up in the body.

10
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,151
And so on.

11
00:00:29,151 --> 00:00:36,190
There are other ways to treat it and I'm just likely skipping that for it.

12
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:37,701
And so for the TCA.

13
00:00:37,701 --> 00:00:42,540
Cycle I'm just gonna zoom in.

14
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,930
Okay so many amino acids.

15
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:47,521
They can be derived from the TCA.

16
00:00:47,521 --> 00:00:51,360
Intermediates or they can also feed into the cycle.

17
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,670
We have two types of synthesis reactions.

18
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:59,821
One that does not use energy.

19
00:00:59,821 --> 00:01:01,340
It's fast over here.

20
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,881
And it's controlled by supply and demand.

21
00:01:03,881 --> 00:01:06,954
So it just tries to maintain homeostasis and

22
00:01:06,954 --> 00:01:10,210
equilibrium of the reaction on both sides.

23
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:11,531
This should be a double arrow.

24
00:01:11,531 --> 00:01:13,260
So their action can go both sides.

25
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,421
And those are called the trans emanates reactions.

26
00:01:15,421 --> 00:01:22,691
We have a multiple step reaction that can use energy and that uses committed steps.

27
00:01:22,691 --> 00:01:27,346
And usually the end product for example, Syrian over here,

28
00:01:27,346 --> 00:01:31,819
as soon as you have sufficient Syrians and Syrian will send

29
00:01:31,819 --> 00:01:36,940
a negative feedback to the first enzyme to inhibit its activity.

30
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:41,582
By which the build up of Syrian is telling the body to stop making Syrian by

31
00:01:41,582 --> 00:01:46,940
inhibiting the very first enzyme responsible for Syrians synthesis.

32
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:51,815
So this is it for example, 16 over here is blocking the first enzyme Syrian over

33
00:01:51,815 --> 00:01:56,421
here and this is the negative feedback loop sent blocking the first enzyme.

34
00:01:56,421 --> 00:02:00,310
Also the trans emanates reactions, for example, over here.

35
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:02,551
Those are very fast.

36
00:02:02,551 --> 00:02:06,530
If you have an excess on one side, let's say you have an excess on this side.

37
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:09,110
Then the reaction would favor the other side.

38
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:11,685
Let's say you have a deficiency on this side,

39
00:02:11,685 --> 00:02:19,340
then the reaction would favor that efficient side to replenish it.

40
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:23,630
So this is what I just did supply and demand control the reaction glutamate and

41
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:24,361
glutamine.

42
00:02:24,361 --> 00:02:26,001
They buffer the nitrogen pool.

43
00:02:26,001 --> 00:02:31,789
So, glutamate is needed to make other you know assets because it partakes and

44
00:02:31,789 --> 00:02:34,381
so many trans am in its reactions.

45
00:02:34,381 --> 00:02:39,040
So it's usually a very major player and making different amino acids.

46
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,940
And we'll talk more about chloramine as well.

47
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:47,914
So this is for example, downstream of just a few examples you have probably including

48
00:02:47,914 --> 00:02:49,150
me in argentine history.

49
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:53,590
So those are things you can make from glutamate and so on and

50
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:58,401
Ellen and you can make it from fire bit and cora made expertise.

51
00:02:58,401 --> 00:03:00,701
You can make it from exile a cities and glutamate.

52
00:03:00,701 --> 00:03:04,703
So we're just trying to highlight the importance of glutamate and

53
00:03:04,703 --> 00:03:07,040
making other amino acids.

54
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,671
So glutamate dehydrogenase.

55
00:03:08,671 --> 00:03:14,937
It's so basically in our system we can make alpha ketoglutarate

56
00:03:14,937 --> 00:03:21,940
by using branch chain amino acids by using ADP, GDP, NAD and so on.

57
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:26,191
Plants are capable of making glutamate directly from

58
00:03:26,191 --> 00:03:28,850
alpha ketoglutarate by itself.

59
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:36,980
We have lost the ability to synthesize glutamate from alpha ketoglutarate alone.

60
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:39,801
So we cannot undergo this reaction.

61
00:03:39,801 --> 00:03:46,091
So those reactions to make to make from those products are only for plants.

62
00:03:46,091 --> 00:03:49,281
We cannot make them due to evolutionary reasons.

63
00:03:49,281 --> 00:03:52,020
So we can still make glutamate from other sources.

64
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:55,986
And through different reactions we just cannot directly

65
00:03:55,986 --> 00:04:00,640
synthesize it from alpha ketoglutarate.

66
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:06,340
So whereas glutamate generated from, so the trans emanates reactions over here.

67
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:06,941
And good.

68
00:04:06,941 --> 00:04:08,705
I mean just keep in mind,

69
00:04:08,705 --> 00:04:13,081
glutamine is somehow the storage form of all ammonia groups.

70
00:04:13,081 --> 00:04:17,370
And it's found in the highest levels and muscle tissue.

71
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:19,361
So in our tissue we have glued.

72
00:04:19,361 --> 00:04:22,900
I mean as somehow the storage form for the amino groups.

73
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:27,193
And what makes what makes clear, I mean a perfect candidate for

74
00:04:27,193 --> 00:04:30,290
this Is it can hold two amino groups at a time.

75
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:35,302
So it's the perfect reservoir for the nitrogen groups and

76
00:04:35,302 --> 00:04:41,141
every single time you want to make protein you will need glutamate.

77
00:04:41,141 --> 00:04:43,981
So glutamine will become glutamate.

78
00:04:43,981 --> 00:04:48,256
You change it into glutamate and then that glutamate can partake and

79
00:04:48,256 --> 00:04:51,106
trans amnesty reactions to give you the other

80
00:04:51,106 --> 00:04:56,040
amino acids that you need to synthesize at the moment.

81
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:00,415
So the good properties is that glutamine can hold up to two

82
00:05:00,415 --> 00:05:02,521
nitrogen groups at a time.

83
00:05:02,521 --> 00:05:06,640
And this is why it's a good start pool for that.

84
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:10,296
So you always rely on essential amino acids when you're

85
00:05:10,296 --> 00:05:12,251
trying to make more protein.

86
00:05:12,251 --> 00:05:14,940
So this is the barrel and an algae over here.

87
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,600
So if you're deficient in one over here at slicing,

88
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,421
then you cannot fill up the barrel.

89
00:05:19,421 --> 00:05:22,640
The water level will always be low.

90
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:26,591
Even if you have more of the other amino acids, you always need all essential.

91
00:05:26,591 --> 00:05:29,940
Amino acids to be in sufficient quantities.

92
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:34,941
So branch chain amino acids, they are they are essential amino acids.

93
00:05:34,941 --> 00:05:38,051
So they're just a subset of the essential amino acids.

94
00:05:38,051 --> 00:05:41,750
They are the live one solution i solution and valley in.

95
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,021
They are very abundant.

96
00:05:43,021 --> 00:05:45,980
And the protein the dietary protein that we eat.

97
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:51,444
But since we keep using them very rapidly every time we undergo protein synthesis

98
00:05:51,444 --> 00:05:57,940
then they are found in the lowest amounts in our body as free amino acids.

99
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:02,540
So we always need to keep consuming branch chain amino acids.

100
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:07,490
There's synthetic branch chain amino acid, the instrumented branch chain amino acids.

101
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:15,611
And we'll talk more about the CIA metabolism and metabolism.

102
00:06:15,611 --> 00:06:17,040
Lecture.

103
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:21,844
Okay, so for every peptide bonds you need to break down,

104
00:06:21,844 --> 00:06:27,640
you will have for you will be using 4 ATP equivalents over here.

105
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:33,041
So if you're sorry for every peptide bonds you make, you need 4 ATP's.

106
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:36,380
So it's very energy costly to be synthesizing protein.

107
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:39,405
And naturally whenever you're eating protein you digest them,

108
00:06:39,405 --> 00:06:41,950
you break down protein and then you synthesize again.

109
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:47,301
So protein has a very high thermic effect of food because it takes

110
00:06:47,301 --> 00:06:54,840
a lot of energy to break it down and then to build it up again in the body.

111
00:06:54,840 --> 00:07:00,060
So if you have ,actin has 374 amino acids, how many ATP's do you need?

112
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,491
How many bonds do you have?

113
00:07:02,491 --> 00:07:04,870
And this? It's 373.

114
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:07,461
So 373 times 4 ATP's.

115
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:09,840
And that would be how much ATP you need.

116
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,655
So how many glucose molecules tree depends if the glucose molecules undergoing like

117
00:07:14,655 --> 00:07:16,911
palaces, then it generates 8 80 P.

118
00:07:16,911 --> 00:07:21,100
So you divide the number of ATP by eight to get the number of glucose.

119
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:24,918
Or if it's undergoing full glycolisis from glucose,

120
00:07:24,918 --> 00:07:27,842
then that's what generates 36 ATP.

121
00:07:27,842 --> 00:07:29,221
Sorry, 32 ATP.

122
00:07:29,221 --> 00:07:31,340
Over here.

123
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:35,491
So how many glucose molecules you need to get that ATP.

124
00:07:35,491 --> 00:07:36,760
needed to make.

125
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:40,578
this protein will depend on how much ATP

126
00:07:40,578 --> 00:07:47,440
generating from full or partial like glycolysis.

127
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,117
So some mechanisms over here when nutrients are high so

128
00:07:50,117 --> 00:07:54,027
you have sufficient amounts of nutrients, you have sufficient amount of ATP.

129
00:07:54,027 --> 00:07:57,030
mTOR would be active and mTOR always promotes synthesis.

130
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:02,821
GCN2 would be inactive and and that's what promotes synthesis ribosome biogenesis and

131
00:08:02,821 --> 00:08:05,620
would inhibit breakdown on the flip side.

132
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:09,581
The opposite is true when amino acids are low mTOR is inactive.

133
00:08:09,581 --> 00:08:11,131
GCN2 is active.

134
00:08:11,131 --> 00:08:13,940
So think of it as active, not inactive.

135
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,841
They're always one is on.

136
00:08:15,841 --> 00:08:19,417
It's always the fact that GCM2 would be on and the answer would be off or

137
00:08:19,417 --> 00:08:20,561
the other way around.

138
00:08:20,561 --> 00:08:23,450
They're not both active at the same time.

139
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:26,081
So GCM2 would be active here.

140
00:08:26,081 --> 00:08:28,987
When amino acids are low and the answer would be an active and

141
00:08:28,987 --> 00:08:30,571
that would promote breakdown.

142
00:08:30,571 --> 00:08:36,799
And FGF21 signaling and actually have 21 signaling is thought to promote appetite.

143
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,861
Especially protein appetite.

144
00:08:38,861 --> 00:08:46,040
So you crave more protein in an attempt to replenish your amino acid pool.

145
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,890
So some things that activate mTOR and eventually synthesis

146
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:53,971
of protein are arginine, lysine, leucine and navy metheny.

147
00:08:53,971 --> 00:08:58,481
So some essential amino assets of mTOR senses that you have enough essential

148
00:08:58,481 --> 00:08:59,331
amino acids.

149
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:00,630
It would promote synthesis.

150
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:01,861
Also insulin.

151
00:09:01,861 --> 00:09:06,471
So and so I always think of it as being anabolic and promoting synthesis.

152
00:09:06,471 --> 00:09:09,311
So that makes sense and also energy level.

153
00:09:09,311 --> 00:09:13,001
So if you have high ATP levels low AMP.

154
00:09:13,001 --> 00:09:14,891
And low AMPK.

155
00:09:14,891 --> 00:09:19,040
Then mTOR would be active.

156
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,631
So this is just a summary of what I just mentioned.

157
00:09:21,631 --> 00:09:24,723
So insulin would promote glucocorticoids blocks

158
00:09:24,723 --> 00:09:28,781
always think of glucocorticoids as trying to break things down.

159
00:09:28,781 --> 00:09:32,840
So this is why they would block protein synthesis and promote protein degradation.

160
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:38,690
Testosterone also would promote protein synthesis and block degradation.

161
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:43,841
Insulin it promotes through mTOR so it would increase

162
00:09:43,841 --> 00:09:49,350
mTOR one activity and this is how it promotes synthesis.

163
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:53,251
Also growth hormone over here it has a dual effect.

164
00:09:53,251 --> 00:09:58,433
So growth hormone would increase protein synthesis through

165
00:09:58,433 --> 00:10:03,308
mTOR Kwan activity and it also helps produce insulin like

166
00:10:03,308 --> 00:10:08,410
growth factor one which mimics the activity of insulin.

167
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:12,871
And also insulin would promote mTOR Kwan and increase it's activity.

168
00:10:12,871 --> 00:10:17,449
So it's like growth hormone has a dual effect like a double positive

169
00:10:17,449 --> 00:10:20,271
effect on promoting protein synthesis.

170
00:10:20,271 --> 00:10:24,691
Which makes sense because you can imagine that someone who has very high levels of

171
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:26,446
growth hormone is growing up and

172
00:10:26,446 --> 00:10:32,340
they need to be making more protein instead of breaking it down.

173
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,167
Okay and that was it.
