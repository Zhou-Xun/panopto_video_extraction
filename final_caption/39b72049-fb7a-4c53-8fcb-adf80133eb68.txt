1
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:12,570
Welcome back to nutrition 590.

2
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,030
To help me convey
why the epigenome

3
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:17,520
is so important for our
health and disease,

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,355
I'm going to turn to two of
my favorite fairy friends,

5
00:00:20,355 --> 00:00:21,915
the agouti mice.

6
00:00:21,915 --> 00:00:25,065
These two mice don't look
much alike, do they?

7
00:00:25,065 --> 00:00:27,960
One's brown, one's yellow,

8
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,480
one's trim, the other looks

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,060
like it could stand to
knock off a few ounces.

10
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:34,890
Well, it might surprise you to

11
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:38,220
learn that these are
in fact sisters,

12
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:42,150
but not just sisters,
they're identical twins.

13
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:44,565
They have the same DNA.

14
00:00:44,565 --> 00:00:48,500
The yellow overweight
mouse, the agouti gene,

15
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,390
when unmethylated, it was

16
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:53,210
turned on all the time when
it should have been off.

17
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:56,570
That caused her to feel less
satisfied after eating,

18
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:58,525
so she just kept eating,

19
00:00:58,525 --> 00:01:00,245
but with the brown mouse,

20
00:01:00,245 --> 00:01:03,440
that gene is completely
methylated and shut down,

21
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,245
so she feels full
and stays slender.

22
00:01:06,245 --> 00:01:09,470
To understand what makes
them look so different,

23
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:14,150
we now have to introduce the
term metastable epialleles.

24
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,280
The first objective of

25
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,590
this module is to
describe the use of

26
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:20,810
the viable yellow agouti mouse in

27
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:24,325
advancing the field of
environmental epigenetics.

28
00:01:24,325 --> 00:01:26,609
Second, we will understand

29
00:01:26,609 --> 00:01:28,970
why metastable epialleles
are particularly

30
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:32,000
vulnerable to environmental
influences and

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,085
contribute to the
developmental origins

32
00:01:34,085 --> 00:01:35,875
of health and disease.

33
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:39,100
That term, metastable epiallele

34
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,900
may sound a bit
unfamiliar at first,

35
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,795
so let's break it down.

36
00:01:43,795 --> 00:01:47,265
Metastable refers to
the labile nature

37
00:01:47,265 --> 00:01:49,795
of the epigenetic
state of such alleles.

38
00:01:49,795 --> 00:01:53,675
That is, they can be
modified by the environment,

39
00:01:53,675 --> 00:01:56,240
especially the very early

40
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,730
environment like a mother's
toxicant or diet exposures.

41
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:05,045
Epiallele refers to the
capacity to maintain

42
00:02:05,045 --> 00:02:08,074
epigenetic states
across cell divisions

43
00:02:08,074 --> 00:02:10,375
or even across generations.

44
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:14,075
For example, in those yellow
mice on the first page,

45
00:02:14,075 --> 00:02:17,150
they are more likely to
have yellow offspring.

46
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:19,010
So the canonical definition of

47
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:22,040
metastable epiallele is an
allele that is variably

48
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,400
expressed in genetically
identical individuals

49
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,905
due to its epigenetic state.

50
00:02:27,905 --> 00:02:30,020
This results in a distribution of

51
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:33,350
phenotypes from genetically
identical cells.

52
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:36,140
Metastable epialleles
are most often,

53
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,000
but not always associated with

54
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,250
repetitive transposable elements

55
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,535
that are usually methylated.

56
00:02:42,535 --> 00:02:44,975
This is what we call a genomic

57
00:02:44,975 --> 00:02:49,055
cartoon of the viable yellow
agouti locus in mice.

58
00:02:49,055 --> 00:02:51,140
In a normal mouse that you might

59
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,044
find wandering around
your basement,

60
00:02:53,044 --> 00:02:56,420
that agouti gene is
expressed only in

61
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,220
hair follicles and only

62
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,935
during a particular
stage of development,

63
00:03:00,935 --> 00:03:02,810
and this leads to animals with

64
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:05,060
either black or brown coat colors

65
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,225
depending on their genotype,

66
00:03:07,225 --> 00:03:10,345
but in the colony of
mice in the 1960s,

67
00:03:10,345 --> 00:03:12,530
a retrotransposon, which is

68
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:15,140
a piece of repetitive
element DNA,

69
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,630
it inserted upstream of

70
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:20,270
the regulatory elements
of the agouti gene.

71
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:23,255
This repetitive piece
of DNA contains

72
00:03:23,255 --> 00:03:26,360
an ectopic promoter
that results in

73
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,960
this gene being expressed
not only in hair follicles,

74
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,180
but across all cell types,

75
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,950
and not only in development,

76
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:36,305
but across all stages of life.

77
00:03:36,305 --> 00:03:40,205
This leads to animals with
yellow coat color phenotypes.

78
00:03:40,205 --> 00:03:42,650
The cryptic promoter contains

79
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:44,780
a variable DNA methylation and

80
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:47,105
histone modifications such that

81
00:03:47,105 --> 00:03:50,330
a yellow mouse is almost
completely unmethylated,

82
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:53,180
and that leads to maximal
ectopic expression

83
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:55,955
of this gene when it
normally should be off.

84
00:03:55,955 --> 00:03:58,190
While the brown mouse contains

85
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:01,475
DNA methylation and
histone modifications

86
00:04:01,475 --> 00:04:03,230
that suppresses that gene,

87
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:06,235
which is what it
normally should be of.

88
00:04:06,235 --> 00:04:09,680
Here is what we call a
polyacrylamide gel of

89
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,955
DNA methylation in five mice
of the varying coat colors.

90
00:04:13,955 --> 00:04:15,995
Starting on the right
side of the gel,

91
00:04:15,995 --> 00:04:20,415
you can see a dark band in
the C or cytosine lane.

92
00:04:20,415 --> 00:04:23,995
This represent high
DNA methylation.

93
00:04:23,995 --> 00:04:26,415
As you move from right to left,

94
00:04:26,415 --> 00:04:29,075
or from brown to model to yellow,

95
00:04:29,075 --> 00:04:33,410
you see a decreased intensity
of cytosine methylation,

96
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:37,145
and this corresponds to the
coat color of the animals.

97
00:04:37,145 --> 00:04:39,975
Now moving the
histone modification,

98
00:04:39,975 --> 00:04:43,180
here we are looking at
histone acetylation on

99
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:46,640
histone protein three and
histone protein four.

100
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:50,170
Recall that histone
acetylation is associated with

101
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:53,765
open chromatin that can
increase gene expression.

102
00:04:53,765 --> 00:04:56,710
In the graphs of the
yellow and brown mice,

103
00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:00,369
you can see that the
yellow mouse has increased

104
00:05:00,369 --> 00:05:02,710
histone acetylation compared to

105
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:05,365
the genetically
identical brown mouse.

106
00:05:05,365 --> 00:05:07,690
This results in this gene being

107
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:10,820
turned on when it
normally should be off.

108
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:13,660
In a normal population
of agouti mice,

109
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,385
the distribution of coat colors

110
00:05:15,385 --> 00:05:17,815
are approximately
normally distributed.

111
00:05:17,815 --> 00:05:20,200
The yellow mice are unmethylated,

112
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,210
they have histone acetylation,

113
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:25,010
the gene is on when it
normally should be off,

114
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:27,725
and that results in
adult onset obesity.

115
00:05:27,725 --> 00:05:30,950
While the genetically
identical brown counterparts,

116
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,750
they have DNA methylation,

117
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,585
they have histone modifications
that are repressive,

118
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:38,800
there's little to no expression
and they remain lean.

119
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,960
We can use this viable
yellow agouti mouse as

120
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,750
what we call an
epigenetic biosensor for

121
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,310
how maternal diet or

122
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:48,080
maternal environment can affect

123
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,690
the population
distribution of mice.

124
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:53,120
So for example, in one of

125
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,535
the first viable yellow
agouti mouse studies,

126
00:05:55,535 --> 00:05:58,880
Rob Waterland gave the mouse
mothers a diet that was

127
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,975
really high in folic acid,
betaine, vitamin B12.

128
00:06:02,975 --> 00:06:05,900
Recall those are methyl donors

129
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,585
important for the one
carbon metabolism cycle.

130
00:06:08,585 --> 00:06:09,950
In this case, when

131
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:12,320
the mothers ate a lot
of methyl donors,

132
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,745
they were more likely to have

133
00:06:13,745 --> 00:06:16,115
offspring with the
brown coat color,

134
00:06:16,115 --> 00:06:18,505
so the methylated coat color.

135
00:06:18,505 --> 00:06:20,630
A second study looked at

136
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,240
the phytoestrogens
genistein which is found

137
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,090
in soy and soy products,
and in this case,

138
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:29,480
a maternal diet
supplemented with soy also

139
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:34,055
resulted in much more brown
lean methylated mice.

140
00:06:34,055 --> 00:06:36,665
So now I want to
turn to an example

141
00:06:36,665 --> 00:06:39,199
of a maternal toxic and exposure.

142
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,975
This is maternal
exposure to bisphenol A,

143
00:06:41,975 --> 00:06:44,060
or BPA for short.

144
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:46,430
BPA is the monomer that makes up

145
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:49,055
hard, clear,
polycarbonate plastic.

146
00:06:49,055 --> 00:06:50,330
It's found in many of

147
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:53,105
our commonly used
products, and in fact,

148
00:06:53,105 --> 00:06:55,880
many CDC studies have detected

149
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:00,145
bisphenol A in over 90
percent of the population.

150
00:07:00,145 --> 00:07:03,930
Bisphenol A is what we call
an endocrine active compound.

151
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:08,260
It has both thyroid hormone
and estrogen hormone effects.

152
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,190
Animal studies have revealed

153
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:12,935
negative health outcomes,
including liver damage,

154
00:07:12,935 --> 00:07:14,930
increased insulin resistance,

155
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:18,050
altered prostate mammary
gland development.

156
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:21,920
In this case, the viable
yellow agouti mouse was used

157
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:25,630
to detect whether maternal
exposure to bisphenol A,

158
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:27,950
at levels that
humans can encounter

159
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:30,755
will affect the offspring
coat color distribution.

160
00:07:30,755 --> 00:07:32,480
Here in the bar graphs you can

161
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,405
see the maternal
exposure to bisphenol A

162
00:07:35,405 --> 00:07:38,090
resulted in a shift in the
coat color distribution

163
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:40,865
towards the yellow
unmethylated mice.

164
00:07:40,865 --> 00:07:42,410
This meant that these
animals who were

165
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:44,440
exposed to bisphenol
A in the womb

166
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,040
were more likely to have

167
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,865
adult onset obesity
later in life.

168
00:07:48,865 --> 00:07:52,340
So now we want to know
what can we do about it.

169
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:56,375
So a new set of mice was
studied, and this time,

170
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:59,150
the mice were still
exposed to bisphenol A,

171
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:02,210
but they were also
supplemented with good diets.

172
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:04,910
Either a diet supplemented
with methyl donors like

173
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:06,890
folic acid or a diet

174
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:10,375
supplemented with that
phytoestrogens, genistein.

175
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:13,730
Looking first at the
methyl donor diet,

176
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:15,560
the scientists observed that

177
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,080
maternal nutritional
supplementation can

178
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,430
counteract the DNA hypomethylated
effects of bisphenol A.

179
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:24,020
There's virtually no difference

180
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,820
between animals who
were exposed to

181
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,740
a controled diet and animals

182
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,960
whose mothers were
exposed to bisphenol A,

183
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:34,075
but also given a really
good methyl donor diet.

184
00:08:34,075 --> 00:08:37,040
Interestingly, a similar effect

185
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,200
occurred with the genistein diet.

186
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,260
Mothers who were
exposed to bisphenol A,

187
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:45,305
but nutritionally supplemented
with genistein also

188
00:08:45,305 --> 00:08:48,920
resulted in counteracting
the effect of toxicants.

189
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,234
These studies are important,

190
00:08:51,234 --> 00:08:53,000
because they show
for the first time

191
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,830
that diet can protect against

192
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:55,880
the toxicant effects of

193
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:00,140
the epigenome, especially
during development.

194
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:04,040
For more information on the
viable yellow agouti mice,

I'll direct you to the
PBS audio slide show

196
00:09:06,845 --> 00:09:08,950
called a tale of two mice.

197
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:11,330
The URL for the slideshow can be

198
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:15,371
found underneath your video.
