Welcome back to Public Health 200, it's great to have you back. The title of this lecture is Health Differences and Disparities in the US.

2
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:17,140
And I would like to thank my colleagues listed here on the slide for their valuable contributions to this lecture.

3
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:28,340
So far this semester, you've learned what public health is, that it focuses on health promotion as well as injury and disease prevention.

4
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:40,270
We've discussed that public health, things of all of society as its patient and that it focuses on the health of communities and groups of people.

5
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:50,410
In a previous lesson, we talked about the concept of population health, how it may overlap with but is distinct from public health.

6
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:56,380
My colleague described key measures for assessing the health of society and spent time

7
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:01,990
showing you how the health of people living in the United States has changed over time,

8
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:14,440
according to those key metrics of population health. My colleague talked about trends in infant mortality, life expectancy and death rates over time.

9
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:24,550
And for the most part, the data provided focused on rates or averages for the entire US population.

10
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:34,950
But today, we're going to complicate the picture a little bit, dig a little deeper and look beyond those averages or general population statistics.

11
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:45,900
Because as you may know from other classes you've taken, from what you've read or watched in the news or maybe even from your own life experiences,

12
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:50,790
there are differences in health outcomes and experiences.

13
00:01:50,790 --> 00:02:01,670
Some groups of people on average tend to be sicker, lead shorter, less healthy lives than other groups of people.

14
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:09,650
If you hadn't encountered this before in other classes in the news or in your personal experiences,

15
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:17,260
you learned a little bit about this in the video you watched or will watch for discussion section this week.

16
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,760
That video,

17
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:29,440
a natural causes is inequality Making US Sick gave you a glimpse into the lives of some people living in various parts of the city of Louisville,

18
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:38,970
Kentucky. The film described the types of jobs these individuals have, the places they work or volunteer,

19
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:44,140
where they live, and the types of grocery stores where they buy food.

20
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:49,240
The video provided a window into some of the stressors in their lives,

21
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:58,360
stressors caused by what they do, where they live and shaped by their social identities.

22
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:07,070
Today's class is going to focus on some of the issues raised in the video and that you'll be talking about in discussion section this week.

23
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:13,560
Specifically today, we will talk about some key terms used in public health.

24
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:21,000
Words matter and applying terms correctly is important to begin this lesson,

25
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,850
I'll provide some definitions to some commonly used words and concepts that

26
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:33,030
you will draw on when we discuss different populations or groups of people.

27
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:41,000
These definitions may be review for some students, but may also be new for other members of our class.

28
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:50,210
These terms and the distinctions between concepts are a foundational part of your public health education.

29
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:58,880
Next, I'll describe different ways of describing health differences here to our language matters,

30
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:06,740
so pay close attention to the various ways we describe health differences among various groups.

31
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:13,920
Next, I'll provide some examples of health disparities that exist today in the United States.

32
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:20,040
And finally, we'll talk about a few factors that contribute to health disparities.

33
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:27,420
This won't be a thorough accounting or in-depth look, but we will spend some time talking about health behaviors,

34
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:33,550
the role of stress and focus on the social determinants of health.

35
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:42,760
Before I dove into the lecture content, I want to highlight that today's lecture touches on all three of our core learning goals,

36
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:53,960
but most directly relates to the third goal to gain understanding and empathy for inequities in health outcomes and experiences.
