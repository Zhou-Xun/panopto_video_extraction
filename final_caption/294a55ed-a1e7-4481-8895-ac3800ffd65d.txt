1
00:00:01,063 --> 00:00:06,560
In this session we'll talk about estimating the recombination fraction.

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:12,160
Learning objectives are to define phase known and phase unknown pedigrees.

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,899
Calculate the recombination fraction and phase known pedigrees.

4
00:00:16,899 --> 00:00:24,345
And describe the maximum likelihood method for estimating the recombination fraction.

5
00:00:24,345 --> 00:00:30,428
We're going to in this section learn about parametric linkage analysis.

6
00:00:30,428 --> 00:00:34,669
The parameter of interest is the recombination fraction.

7
00:00:34,669 --> 00:00:39,910
In this kind of study we want to collect pedigree data with many meiotic events or

8
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:44,229
many events where people are forming gametes that we can look at.

9
00:00:44,229 --> 00:00:51,028
So we're either gonna need a lot of generations and or a lot of children.

10
00:00:51,028 --> 00:00:55,418
We're also going to make some assumptions about how the disease is inherited.

11
00:00:55,418 --> 00:01:00,139
We're going to think about is that at a single locus versus multiple genes or

12
00:01:00,139 --> 00:01:02,737
multilocus that might be contributing.

13
00:01:02,737 --> 00:01:05,753
Do we assume dominant disease or recessive disease?

14
00:01:05,753 --> 00:01:08,951
And what do we assume about penetrance.

15
00:01:08,951 --> 00:01:11,973
The kind of linkage analysis that we're gonna learn

16
00:01:11,973 --> 00:01:15,689
to do by hand will only look at very simple modes of inheritance.

17
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:18,893
So a dominant disease with complete penettance for

18
00:01:18,893 --> 00:01:22,627
example or recessive disease with complete penetrances.

19
00:01:22,627 --> 00:01:28,132
But just know that you can use the technique of parametric linkage analysis.

20
00:01:28,132 --> 00:01:33,578
To analyze very complicated pedigrees with really

21
00:01:33,578 --> 00:01:40,552
complicated hypotheses about the genetic mode of inheritance.

22
00:01:40,552 --> 00:01:45,425
In parametric linkage analysis we can do it with phase known or

23
00:01:45,425 --> 00:01:47,587
phase unknown pedigrees.

24
00:01:47,587 --> 00:01:49,519
In a phase known pedigree,

25
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:54,562
you know how the alleles are distributed on the parental chromosomes.

26
00:01:54,562 --> 00:01:59,608
And in a phase unknown pedigree you know which alleles come from which parent but

27
00:01:59,608 --> 00:02:02,863
you don't know how they're distributed on the chromosomes.

28
00:02:03,611 --> 00:02:07,940
So to give an example, let's consider two

29
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:12,640
marker Loci VNTR A and VNTR B on chromosome 1.

30
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,245
Marker A has two alleles 11 and 13 and

31
00:02:17,245 --> 00:02:21,185
marker B has two alleles 5 and 6.

32
00:02:21,185 --> 00:02:25,958
So let's think about a person in the parental

33
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:30,227
generation that has a genotype of 11,

34
00:02:30,227 --> 00:02:34,381
13 at marker A and 5, 6 at marker B.

35
00:02:34,381 --> 00:02:39,240
If we know which alleles occur on each of his chromosomes, he's phase known.

36
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:44,535
So for example if we know that on one of his chromosomes he

37
00:02:44,535 --> 00:02:50,064
has the 11 allele at VNTR A and the 5 allele at the VNTR B.

38
00:02:50,064 --> 00:02:54,529
And on the other chromosome he's got a 13 VNTR A and

39
00:02:54,529 --> 00:02:59,009
a 6 at VNTR B then that person is called phase known.

40
00:02:59,009 --> 00:03:01,880
However, if he has that genotype but

41
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:05,399
we don't know how the allele from marker A and

42
00:03:05,399 --> 00:03:11,342
marker B are occurring on the chromosomes, then he would be phase unknown.

43
00:03:11,342 --> 00:03:16,439
So for example the same person with that same genotype

44
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:20,855
could be carrying a chromosome that has 11,

45
00:03:20,855 --> 00:03:24,602
5 haplotype and 13, 6 haplotype.

46
00:03:24,602 --> 00:03:28,787
That could be one way that those alleles are configured on his chromosomes.

47
00:03:28,787 --> 00:03:32,590
Or he could have a chromosome with the 11, 6 haplotype and

48
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:36,406
then the other chromosome would be the 13, 5 haplotype.

49
00:03:36,406 --> 00:03:41,256
If we don't know which of those possibilities he has then we

50
00:03:41,256 --> 00:03:43,199
don't know his phase.

51
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:46,558
The phase means we know the haplotype.

52
00:03:49,377 --> 00:03:53,575
For phase known pedigrees where we actually know the haplotype of

53
00:03:53,575 --> 00:03:54,497
the parents.

54
00:03:54,497 --> 00:04:01,277
We can estimate the recombination fraction theta using the following formula.

55
00:04:01,277 --> 00:04:06,258
We're gonna look at all of the meioses that have happened

56
00:04:06,258 --> 00:04:10,532
the by looking at the genotype of the offspring.

57
00:04:10,532 --> 00:04:16,008
In order to do that, we're gonna look at the number of recombinants haplotype or

58
00:04:16,008 --> 00:04:17,467
gametes that we see.

59
00:04:17,467 --> 00:04:21,113
And we're going to divide by the number of informative meioses.

60
00:04:21,113 --> 00:04:26,290
So an informative meioses is when parents form gannets that

61
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:32,098
provides information about the recombination between two loci.

62
00:04:32,098 --> 00:04:34,117
In phase known pedigrees,

63
00:04:34,117 --> 00:04:38,769
the probability of an offspring being recombinant is theta and

64
00:04:38,769 --> 00:04:43,473
the probability of an offspring being non-recombinant is 1-theta.

65
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:47,836
Because they're either recombinant or their non-recombinant.

66
00:04:48,157 --> 00:04:53,036
So let's look at an example of a phase known pedigree here we have again

67
00:04:53,036 --> 00:04:54,369
our two VNTR loci.

68
00:04:54,369 --> 00:04:58,651
Locus A has alleles 11 and 13 and

69
00:04:58,651 --> 00:05:02,231
locus B has alleles 5 and 6.

70
00:05:02,231 --> 00:05:04,731
Let's assume that this mom and

71
00:05:04,731 --> 00:05:10,220
dad are gonna be looking at their meioses or the kids that they have.

72
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:13,992
In order to see if we can find evidence of a combination,

73
00:05:13,992 --> 00:05:16,333
let's say that we know the phase.

74
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:21,389
So for the mom we know that she has a chromosome that has haplotype 11,

75
00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:25,610
5 and the other chromosome she has is haplotype 13, 6.

76
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:31,426
And the dad has two chromosomes that has haplotype 11, 5.

77
00:05:31,426 --> 00:05:33,138
So let's first think about the dad.

78
00:05:33,138 --> 00:05:39,021
The dad can only contribute the 11, 5 haplotype chromosome to each of his kids.

79
00:05:39,021 --> 00:05:43,505
So down here where we've drawn the kids, we've got a chromosome that's 11, 5.

80
00:05:43,505 --> 00:05:47,159
The bottom chromosome that we've drawn here is 11, 5 for each child.

81
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:53,277
Okay, if there was a recombination event here in the dad's meioses,

82
00:05:53,277 --> 00:05:55,257
we would never see it.

83
00:05:55,257 --> 00:05:59,781
Because the parental haplotype 11, 5 would be the same

84
00:05:59,781 --> 00:06:04,504
as the recombined haplotype, it would always be 11, 5.

85
00:06:04,504 --> 00:06:09,354
So the meioses from this dad are not informative.

86
00:06:09,354 --> 00:06:12,287
However, we know the haplotypes for the mom.

87
00:06:12,287 --> 00:06:18,023
And if she contributes an 11, 5 or 13, 6 haplotype to her kids,

88
00:06:18,023 --> 00:06:24,752
those are going to be parental haplotype and they are gonna be non-recombinant.

89
00:06:24,752 --> 00:06:28,481
If she contributes an 11, 6 or 13, 5,

90
00:06:28,481 --> 00:06:33,686
you know there was a recombination during that meioses that she

91
00:06:33,686 --> 00:06:38,715
had in order to generate that chromosome to give to her kids.

92
00:06:38,715 --> 00:06:46,279
So we can look at each kid and each kid represents one informative meioses.

93
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:51,392
The moms meioses are informative because we can see the crossing over.

94
00:06:51,392 --> 00:06:56,478
So in this child, the child has the haplotype 11,

95
00:06:56,478 --> 00:07:00,999
5, which is parental or non-recombinant.

96
00:07:00,999 --> 00:07:06,056
And this one from their mom they got a 13, 6 also non-recombinant.

97
00:07:06,056 --> 00:07:11,158
This child got an 11, 6, that's a recombinant haplotype and

98
00:07:11,158 --> 00:07:15,912
13, 5 in this last child is also recombinant haplotype.

99
00:07:15,912 --> 00:07:20,574
So the probability of this non-recombinant haplotype is gonna be

100
00:07:20,574 --> 00:07:25,080
1-theta because theta is the probability of recombination.

101
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:30,970
So the probability of seeing these kids are 1-theta and 1-theta and

102
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:37,072
here the probability of seeing the recombinant child is theta and theta.

103
00:07:37,072 --> 00:07:42,309
So we can estimate theta that probability by looking

104
00:07:42,309 --> 00:07:47,546
at the number of recombinant divided by the number of

105
00:07:47,546 --> 00:07:53,033
informative meioses and here it's 2/4 or 1/2.

106
00:07:53,033 --> 00:07:57,370
For phase unknown pedigree, we don't know the parental haplotype.

107
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:01,926
So there's no way that we can actually estimate theta directly because we don't

108
00:08:01,926 --> 00:08:05,474
know whether the offspring are recombination or non-recombinant.

109
00:08:05,891 --> 00:08:12,662
So here the 11, 5 would be non-recombinant if the mom was in this phase.

110
00:08:12,662 --> 00:08:18,075
If the phase of the mom was, she had been 11, 5 and a 13, 6 haplotype,

111
00:08:18,075 --> 00:08:22,829
then this kid, what they got from her would be non-recombinant.

112
00:08:22,829 --> 00:08:27,692
But if the mom was in this phase and she actually had 11, 6 and 13,

113
00:08:27,692 --> 00:08:31,815
5 haplotype then this child would have gotten an 11 5 and

114
00:08:31,815 --> 00:08:35,044
that would have signaled the recombination.

115
00:08:35,044 --> 00:08:39,877
So the child would be considered non-recombinant if mom was in

116
00:08:39,877 --> 00:08:44,177
phase one here or were competent if mom was in phase two.

117
00:08:44,177 --> 00:08:49,119
So we actually don't know the probability of of observing that kid because we

118
00:08:49,119 --> 00:08:51,636
don't know which phase the mom was in.

119
00:08:51,636 --> 00:08:58,176
So there's no way to directly estimate theta in that scenario.

120
00:08:58,176 --> 00:09:03,434
So in order to think about how to estimate theta for pedigrees we're

121
00:09:03,434 --> 00:09:08,800
gonna have to know a little bit about the maximum likelihood method.

122
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,157
So we can estimate data for any pedigree, phase known or

123
00:09:13,157 --> 00:09:17,795
phase unknown using the maximum likelihood equation which

124
00:09:17,795 --> 00:09:21,890
takes the data in the pedigree and ask the question.

125
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:26,511
What data would result in the largest likelihood given

126
00:09:26,511 --> 00:09:31,538
the number of recombinant and non-recombinant gametes?

127
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:36,488
So the likelihood is a function of theta.

128
00:09:36,488 --> 00:09:38,628
We're gonna estimate theta.

129
00:09:38,628 --> 00:09:43,084
And the formula that we would use is that there's a constant that

130
00:09:43,084 --> 00:09:48,119
represents the probability of seeing the certain number of competent or

131
00:09:48,119 --> 00:09:50,944
non-competent offspring that we saw.

132
00:09:50,944 --> 00:09:53,857
Which we're actually gonna ignore.

133
00:09:53,857 --> 00:09:56,582
And for a reason, I'll show you later.

134
00:09:56,582 --> 00:10:02,210
And then this 1-theta is the probability of seeing a non-recombinant.

135
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:10,130
We're gonna raise that to the probability of the number of non-recombinant meioses.

136
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:13,518
Here's the probability of seeing a competent offspring and

137
00:10:13,518 --> 00:10:17,050
we're gonna raise it to the number of recombination meioses.

138
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:21,700
So essentially we've got the probability of seeing a recombinant kid

139
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,312
times the number of recombinant kids.

140
00:10:24,312 --> 00:10:29,266
Times the probability of seeing a non-recombinant kid raised to the power

141
00:10:29,266 --> 00:10:31,396
of the non-recombinant kids.

142
00:10:31,396 --> 00:10:31,462
We can actually get the maximum likelihood estimate of theta or

143
00:10:36,223 --> 00:10:40,606
the best guess at theta given what we see in the pedigree.

144
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:46,423
By some tricks where we take the natural log of the likelihood and

145
00:10:46,423 --> 00:10:52,254
then we take the derivative of that and then we set it equal to 0.

146
00:10:52,254 --> 00:10:54,950
You don't need to know all the mathematical pieces.

147
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:58,974
What I want you to know is that if you have a phase known pedigree and

148
00:10:58,974 --> 00:11:03,890
you can directly look at the number of recombinant and non-recombinant kids.

149
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:07,663
This maximum likelihood estimate gives what we would expect.

150
00:11:07,663 --> 00:11:13,742
K/n the number of recombinant kids over the total number of informative meioses.

151
00:11:13,742 --> 00:11:16,504
When we have a phase unknown pedigree,

152
00:11:16,504 --> 00:11:21,287
we're gonna see later what we have to do to modify this likelihood.

153
00:11:21,287 --> 00:11:25,967
So here I wanna show you that linkage analysis uses the information in

154
00:11:25,967 --> 00:11:30,982
the pedigrees to estimate theta using the maximum likelihood equation.

155
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:35,763
And we're going to test that to indicate the probability

156
00:11:35,763 --> 00:11:38,206
that the genes or markers are link.
