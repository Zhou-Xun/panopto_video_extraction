1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:05,310
Okay. We will go ahead and get started.

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:09,750
Welcome back. Ah, I. I guess I'm the one who's back.

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:18,780
You guys have been here all along. But happy Friday and welcome to the last day of HSA 69.

4
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:34,880
I am so sorry for a few of you emailed me over this time period when I was in Israel and there was a snafu with a critic and I.

5
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:47,640
When I got back into the U.S., I was down for the count basically all this week, just not feeling well after not sleeping and whatnot for a week.

6
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:52,170
But it was an amazing trip, so well worth it.

7
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:58,290
But I just wanted to again apologize for any issues with Critic.

8
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:03,510
This was a kind of a pilot system that we wanted to test with the class.

9
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:10,590
And when I do this, especially as a relatively new instructor, there's always a risk to implement something new.

10
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:17,790
So we could have some issues and hopefully it wasn't too bad and you don't hold it against me.

11
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:25,590
But with regard to critic, how many of you got reviews on your abstract?

12
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:29,700
Like how many of you submitted and got reviews? So most of you did. A few of you did not.

13
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:35,580
I understand. So what I'm going to do is send around a Google sheet if you want,

14
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,370
if any of you want feedback on your abstract and you didn't get feedback through

15
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:45,840
critic sign that Google sheet and I'll make sure to give you some good feedback.

16
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,850
Yeah. So I did receive feedback where I was not able to get feedback.

17
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:59,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I know a couple of you and yeah, I realize that there was that issue.

18
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:04,560
And again, I apologize. I think, you know, I know that we're getting to finals week.

19
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,350
If you want to provide some feedback on a couple of abstracts, I can give you some.

20
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,350
But again, I don't want to put that on you.

21
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:19,470
I know I realized like I didn't get back to you guys and I don't want to put that on you during finals week,

22
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:29,790
so I can definitely provide feedback to anybody who doesn't get feedback, but I appreciate you all giving it a try.

23
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:34,440
How many of you have filled out course evaluations so far? Is anybody done those?

24
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,850
Couple of you if you haven't yet.

25
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:46,079
Please feel free to put in there. Like in the written portion what you thought about the critic system.

26
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:52,530
The instructional services. Kind of would love to hear more about how it's working for students.

27
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:58,500
Again, I realize like there's some kinks that we would need to iron out if we were going to move forward with this.

28
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:07,500
Like people getting shut out. If there's a like I thought that the deadlines were more of a more flexible where it will

29
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,100
actually just shut you right out of the system and you can't use it after the deadline.

30
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,900
But anyway, please feel free to provide any feedback you have on that.

31
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:23,070
And if you anybody who has already filled out the course evaluation and still wants to provide feedback, just let me know.

32
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:31,310
Is there any quote? Does anybody have any questions or any concerns, anything that came up in the last couple of weeks?

33
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,430
Oh, I am confused. Are we supposed to submit our abstract somewhere other than critic?

34
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:42,240
No. No. Yeah, everything's on there so I can check in.

35
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,610
Yeah. A couple of you submitted abstracts to me, but they didn't end up on credit.

36
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:49,740
Great. And, yeah, so I have everybody's abstracts.

37
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:54,840
Either they sent me an email or I'm critic, so yeah, we should be all set there.

38
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:58,130
And so everybody will get credit.

39
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:07,140
And if you if you, you know, we're involved in the snafu with with credit, don't worry about it hurting your grade or anything in the class.

40
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:11,220
Again, I just want to try this on a trial basis.

41
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:16,680
Um, so we have four presentations today.

42
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,640
I don't know who wants to go first. I'll go first.

43
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:29,540
All right. Yeah, I get it all the way. Lawrence.

44
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:36,500
Besides this. All right.

45
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:41,150
You two were the only ones who sent me any. Ariana, I can do that.

46
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:46,070
Oh, that's all right. What's that? I put it in the bathtub.

47
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:51,320
You put it on here. Oh, okay. As long as it's on here and you can find it, then that's totally fine.

48
00:04:51,860 --> 00:05:00,230
I'll get out of your way. You go ahead in space or the arrow to move through them like this.

49
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,710
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Let me know if you need other things.

50
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:09,040
Hi, everyone. I'm onshore.

51
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:18,890
I'm a first year MSC studying jazz and I don't have a research project yet or anything like that, but this is just potentially what I'm interested in.

52
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:27,740
So the title of my presentation is exposure to exposure to traffic density in urban populations and its impact on birthing outcomes.

53
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:35,839
So what I did was I modeled my presentation and my potential research project after a

54
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:42,799
study that was done in Madrid and just some background information as exposure to PM 2.5,

55
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:48,410
cadmium and benzene can lead to low birth weight and preterm birth.

56
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:54,889
And this study looked at traffic density near the birthing person's house and determined

57
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:59,930
if there was an association between high traffic and low birth weight in newborns.

58
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:09,500
So materials and methods, if this was to be applied to my research thesis, my study would need to be done locally in an urban setting.

59
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:14,930
And this might be a limitation, but it would have to be really specific to that population.

60
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:20,780
And I would utilize birthing data from hospitals and I would get the address of where

61
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:25,519
the birthing person lived and then use the U.S. Department of Transportation's

62
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:37,220
traffic volume report to calculate a 100 meter radius between the traffic density and like what's happening around their home and where they live.

63
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:43,670
And then this gives an accurate representation of their daily exposures because that's where they live.

64
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,570
And then some other data to consider, though, is their age, socioeconomic status,

65
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:54,980
race and other reproductive health information that I would have to test for.

66
00:06:56,330 --> 00:07:03,170
So this is a map of the national highway system during the pandemic.

67
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:13,460
And if we look and see the green line show that traffic congestion is below capacity, yellow is approaching capacity and red is exceeding capacity.

68
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:20,929
So if you look in urban populations, we see that they're all highlighted in red, especially in New York and in Detroit and in southern Florida.

69
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:27,080
And like Miami, this is important to know because even at a time when we were supposed to be in lockdown,

70
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:33,830
traffic congestion was still high, which means that birthing persons were still being impacted by air pollution.

71
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:44,600
So yeah, and this is also furthermore important because racial and ethnic minorities make up about 45% of the population in urban areas,

72
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:50,870
and nonwhite populations and black populations are more likely to be exposed to greater amounts of particulate

73
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:58,880
matter and breathing persons exposed to PM 2.5 and oh three or more likely to have a preterm birth.

74
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:08,120
So goals for my project are to once again I resume the correlation between traffic density in urban

75
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:13,310
areas and in minority populations and how that correlates with birth weight and preterm births.

76
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:21,260
And it does bring awareness to how it's impacting these populations and recognize the need for traffic policies in urban areas.

77
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,910
And based on the study that I looked at,

78
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:33,860
some predicted results are that there is a correlation between high traffic density and low birth weight in newborns.

79
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:41,120
And yes, there will be further research that's needed to be done to implement these policies and reduce congestion.

80
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:45,680
And these are my references, and that's all.

81
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,780
Question spots.

82
00:08:53,500 --> 00:09:02,710
Haley I'm just curious to know who you've reached out to or if you've identified an advisor that is in this line of research or for you or not.

83
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:09,820
I spoke to Dr. Meeker about it. He said that he got data for a project, Puerto Rico, that kind of looks at this already.

84
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:16,120
So I would potentially have to tweak what I want to look at in order to fit that data set.

85
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:23,830
So he won't be joining in. Any other questions?

86
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:32,520
So how would you if you're when you do these sort of studies of traffic pollution,

87
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:38,660
how do you account for like seasonal variability or different things about.

88
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,780
So this study listed that as a limitation.

89
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:52,260
But I think when I go into this and like actually do it myself, I would have to like take that into consideration when doing my analysis.

90
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:55,320
It would probably be one of my confounding variables.

91
00:09:55,390 --> 00:10:01,020
Yeah. Yeah. Because like in the summertime, roadwork is like really high.

92
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:10,110
Yeah. So honestly, I might have to make my study specific towards the season, you know, that would be.

93
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:15,380
That would actually be. Thank you. That would actually be a really good. Thank you.

94
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:21,360
All right. That's actually a very good record with this for improving it.

95
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,180
Anyone else going once, twice.

96
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:32,380
All right. Thank you, guys. What's up?

97
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:35,510
Do I just exit the tab? I the place that.

98
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:43,479
For instance. Somewhere on the PowerPoint.

99
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:47,460
And I kind of I don't know who wants to go next. I can go next.

100
00:10:49,720 --> 00:11:31,560
And it's about making that point first. Okay.

101
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:39,120
All right. So are we talking a little bit about what I'm proposing for my dissertation project?

102
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:45,090
I'm hoping I can do this in 5 minutes. This is harder to make than the actual prelim presentation,

103
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:53,159
but I'll be looking at the impacts of people's exposure on both epigenetic age and immunity in two different populations.

104
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:56,160
So an occupational population and then an adolescent population.

105
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:01,350
So I'll go over a little bit of background on each subtopic.

106
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:09,180
A brief intro to the cohorts, and then I'll go through very quickly my specific aims and methods and then what I expect to see.

107
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:18,090
So a lot of people have talked about past this semester already, so people start, pare and polyfluoroalkyl substances.

108
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:21,090
It's a very large chemical, a family of chemicals,

109
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:26,880
including over 9000 different chemicals that have been in use in a ton of different products since 1940,

110
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:30,730
ranging from nonstick pans to scuba wetsuits to food packaging.

111
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:41,400
And pivots don't break down very quickly. So they persist in the environment and in the body for a very long time, up to years or some.

112
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:49,470
We don't even know how long they last. There have been a lot of studies of enhanced data that look at how PE for us impacts immunity.

113
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:55,620
And some important things that have come out recently are that elevated levels of PE fast

114
00:12:55,620 --> 00:13:01,890
exposure contribute to reduced immunity in children after vaccines to tennis or diphtheria.

115
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:11,370
He was exposure has also been associated with a higher burden of various viruses, various parasitic infections like toxoplasmosis or COVID.

116
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:20,250
And it's also been associated with an increased risk of both getting COVID 19 and having severe consequences of that COVID 19 infection.

117
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:25,710
Just a very brief intro to epigenetics as well.

118
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:33,899
Epigenetics looks at modifications to DNA that don't actually modify the DNA sequence, but do change gene expression.

119
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:40,560
So modifications like methylation or histone modifications that turn a gene off or on or kind of off or kind of on.

120
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:45,810
And this can be really impacted by your environmental exposures to things like people's.

121
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:53,460
So one tool that's derived from epigenetics is epigenetic age.

122
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:58,470
And this is a novel major of biological age as opposed to your chronological age.

123
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:02,340
So if I say I'm 26 years old, that's my chronological age.

124
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:06,389
But epigenetic age accounts for all of the different exposures I've had.

125
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:10,200
And so maybe my epigenetic age kind of looks like I'm 40.

126
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,620
I feel 40, so especially to that.

127
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:20,460
But epigenetic age uses those epigenetic changes as a biomarker of aging.

128
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:24,180
And this is done according to a lot of different clocks that account for a lot of different things.

129
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:30,150
So for example, the original clock was the Horvath's clock, and this uses lots of different tissues.

130
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:38,639
It's considered a stable clock, it's commonly used and then a lot more have been developed since then that use different tissues.

131
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:43,470
So skin or blood venoms accounts a lot for environmental exposures.

132
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:57,740
So I'll be using all five of these. So we're looking at epigenetic age in one cohort and immunity in both cohorts of using a cohort of firefighters.

133
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:07,220
The Firefighter Cancer Cohort study that includes my subset includes 422 members right now but will go up to about 600.

134
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:12,139
This cohort is recruited nationally from firefighters that work at airports,

135
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:18,350
fighting wildfires or fighting structural fires in cities and will eventually include 10,000 members

136
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:23,600
as originally started in 2014 to look at cancer and other chronic disease endpoints in firefighters.

137
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:31,249
My other cohort is a cohort of 15 year olds in Chitwan, the pilot who were followed up with when they were born.

138
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:37,220
And then at six months and two years and three years to look at metal exposures and then we'll be looking at immunity in these children as well.

139
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:42,530
So he was in general is found everywhere.

140
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:48,410
But since this cohort of children is in Nepal, there have been very few studies of people's presence in Nepal,

141
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:56,810
but there have been a few that have found it in snow on Everest soil, water and dust in cities and in rural areas and in rivers, soils.

142
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:00,230
There have been a lot of studies, though, out of southern China.

143
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:06,750
China publishes the second most studies on before us after the U.S. and also a lot of studies in the Tibetan plateau.

144
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:13,550
So these are similar geographically. So it's very likely that peoples is prevalent in Nepal, even if that data isn't being published as much.

145
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:19,970
However, in Nepal, there are no national regulations on reporting, divorce or exposure or disposal at all.

146
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:28,559
So my big picture question, putting all this together is how does fast exposure in our daily environment or in

147
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:33,030
our workplace affects the ability of the immune system to respond to infections?

148
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:39,690
And this happens through epigenetic mechanisms. So we're looking at three different aims.

149
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,340
So my first two will look at that firefighter cohort,

150
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:48,550
so I'll be looking at how he files concentration and blood, affects epigenetic age in the firefighters,

151
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:57,639
and then how it affects the methylation of different genes that are about involved in the immune system at 491 different sites and then AM three,

152
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:06,430
I'll be looking at the Nepali cohort of children and looking at how PE falls in the blood affects antibody levels specifically to cytomegalovirus,

153
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:09,820
which is a very high prevalence herpes virus, and then to COVID 19.

154
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:17,120
So very, very, very brief methods. First phase is data collection.

155
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,240
So both we'll have surveys and then blood collection.

156
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:27,670
Firefighter cancer cohort study has already done this. And then the Chitwan birth cohort will be doing dried blood spot collection in February.

157
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:31,490
Next year, these samples will be tested for us.

158
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:40,860
The firefighter samples were tested at the CDC and the Nepal samples will be tested by Eurofins and then lab work.

159
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:48,580
We extract DNA from the blood samples, analyze the methylation of the DNA using an Illumina epic array.

160
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:51,440
And then for the Nepal samples,

161
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:58,130
I'll quantify the antibodies to COVID and cytomegalovirus using two different differential ELISA kits for each of those antibodies

162
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:06,950
will then determine epigenetic age using this calculator tool that has all of the different clocks for the firefighters.

163
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:11,930
And then we'll do multivariate analysis for both of us and then the various outcomes.

164
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:19,910
And then after that, we'll report back our findings to the firefighter cohort and to our collaborators at Shravan in Kathmandu.

165
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:30,750
So based on a previous study by Dr. Goodrich, we saw that three different profiles were linked with accelerated epigenetic age.

166
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:34,950
So the firefighters looked older from their exposures than they actually were.

167
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:44,670
And then three specifically long chain five isotopes were associated with methylation at CBG sites in genes that are involved in immunity.

168
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:51,450
So we hypothesize that people's exposure will be associated with accelerated epigenetic age in the firefighters.

169
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,830
Methylation at CPG sites in that set of immune genes.

170
00:18:56,010 --> 00:19:05,970
And also suppression of production of antibodies in the children and. Okay.

171
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:24,930
So for your different end points, why? Choosing to look at epigenetic age only in firefighters and antibodies only in the children

172
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:30,120
as we have the epigenetic age where the firefighters already calculate as part of the study.

173
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:39,150
But since I'm kind of starting the Nipah study as part of another study, it would be really, really expensive to do.

174
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:49,350
So they're sticking to like a more kind of cost effective and realistic to do in that environment with those resources the way how do you know?

175
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:53,090
Do you know why they chose a chip on a specific idea?

176
00:19:53,100 --> 00:20:01,079
And I don't actually know why they originally chose it, but they've been following up this study for the past 15 years,

177
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:05,459
so they've just stuck with that area and they had 50 kids in this cohort and

178
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:11,670
would like to recruit those 50 back in October and actually recruited back 74.

179
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:16,260
So I guess it's a guessing game.

180
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:20,940
What are your genes of interest? I have a set of 26.

181
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:29,070
I don't know them off the top of my head, but I will probably also expand that set to look at like more.

182
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:32,490
But the ones I've chosen right now are ones that have been reported in the literature,

183
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:37,290
specifically in human studies, to be both impacted by force and to affect immune function.

184
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:51,270
So are these like T-cell related or sort of. I just wondered, what do you have against people being 41?

185
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:56,520
Nothing. Random age. I feel super old right now.

186
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:03,300
You know, when I was in my early twenties, my late twenties felt like really old.

187
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:09,600
Yeah, I just had a lot of stress from graduates. I was having, like, sciatic nerve issues.

188
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:15,150
Okay. Apparently, they all on one leg, and it was just. I mean, how am I going to feel when I'm 50?

189
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,970
That's I keep hurting myself all the time. Like my head hurts when it's cold.

190
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:41,100
So I feel better than I did. And I'm like, it's good to them because I just emailed it to you.

191
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:45,450
Is your email up? Can you just pull it down or I can log in to mine.

192
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:55,980
Roots is twice. Okay.

193
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:04,950
Yeah, sure. Let's see what happens when I do.

194
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:08,790
From beginning. Yes.

195
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:43,130
But will it automatically? No. No. Mag.

196
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:47,300
Am I doing it right? Okay, pleasure. Okay.

197
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:53,230
This one's okay. Not sure. Once you start a slideshow, I should scream.

198
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:57,870
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. We're good. Sweet. Okay.

199
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:04,670
Hi, everyone. My name is Ariana Heydari. I'm a second year pastry student in the Do Good Spy lab.

200
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:13,139
I mostly work with Jackie Goodrich, but for this project, I'm going to be talking about my second research rotation,

201
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:22,200
which was primarily with Dr. Penny PEREIRA, who was here last week, and as it's the last day of class.

202
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:29,090
One thing I said last year is that my love language, at least my professional love language, is constructive criticism.

203
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:33,900
So I've given you all lots of picky things, so feel free to let me have it and I'm just kidding.

204
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:42,590
Okay, so I'm going to try to talk about today is to convince you that your parents you're a placenta because the placenta is an organ of the concept.

205
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:46,950
So it was yours and a switchboard are related.

206
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:54,269
So let's see if you agree with me by the end of this. So what do I mean by these things?

207
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:56,310
Your parents, your placenta, a switchboard.

208
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:07,530
Starting last winter semester, I was working with Patti PEREIRA to look at imprinted genes in placenta samples.

209
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:15,840
And when we think about imprinted genes is important to think about how they differ from most of the rest of our regular genes.

210
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:20,910
So we think about how we get our genes from our parents, right?

211
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:27,150
We get one to for our mom when I live on our dad. And that helps make sure that our inheritance goes smoothly.

212
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:32,550
But with imprinted genes, we only have one of those alleles expressed.

213
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:37,020
And so we got the parents down, we got the placenta part down.

214
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:45,750
Let's talk a little bit about the switchboard analogy. So in the in an imprinted gene,

215
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:56,219
the as I mentioned that we only have a single parental alil expressed and the other allele is completely silenced generally by DNA methylation.

216
00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:01,530
But there's a lot of complicated regulatory processes in there that we're not going to talk about today.

217
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:09,120
I still this slide from age 660. So if you take that class next year, you'll recognize it.

218
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:18,480
But just comparing how, you know how a gene is typically inherited versus an imprinted gene.

219
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:25,740
So we're all good on that. Cool. So then these are really important in development.

220
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:35,669
And they we've we've seen that a lot of developmental disorders and other sorts of problems can occur if these genes get messed up.

221
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:37,020
So let's talk about that a little bit.

222
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:44,729
So some of the reasons that we're concerned with imprinted genes is typically when we have when we see a problem,

223
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:49,500
a health problem, it's not usually associated with one gene. But in these cases, these genes are.

224
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:59,549
So, for example, there's a maternally expressed gene that if it's inheritance is is disregulated in some way becomes Angelman syndrome,

225
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:03,000
which is a very severe genetic disorder.

226
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:12,540
And you may have heard of Prader-Willi syndrome, which is where if the maternally expressed gene is dysregulated the again,

227
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:19,680
a developmental disorder, it's marked by hyper fascia. So these are very severe disorders.

228
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:28,410
So we really want to understand how this inheritance is regulated and what we can even do if there's a case of dysregulation.

229
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:35,970
So this is where this topic you might have heard of called pioneer comes in part is very complicated.

230
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:44,430
I don't really know what I'm doing when I'm talking about it. So we are going to treat Pioneer in this scenario as a switchboard operator.

231
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:51,900
And what I mean by that is that Pioneer plays a role in regulating how imprinted genes are expressed.

232
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:57,540
And specifically for this experiment, we involve the placenta.

233
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:01,950
Why? Because pioneers happen to be extremely active in the placenta.

234
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:04,770
So it looks it seems like a good tissue to start in.

235
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:15,200
So just to review where we're at so far, we want to know how they're regulated, what happens when they're disrupted, and can we intervene.

236
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:18,889
So for this project, we have two cohorts,

237
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:26,840
the Michigan Mother Infant Pairs Cohort and Dr. Courtney Townsville is an obstetrician who's working with mothers who

238
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:35,960
have been exposed to opiates in some form before or during their pregnancy and are now on opioid treatment protocol.

239
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:44,990
So we have placenta samples from both of these two cohorts that we can use to compare the differences in imprinted gene expression.

240
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:55,520
So we selected some different imprinted genes maternally expressed as the meg thing here and then did three DLP one.

241
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:59,800
Not super important for this discussion, but these are paternal. We express that we're also looking at.

242
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:05,600
So the plan is to compare exposure levels. Expression levels, pardon me by exposure group.

243
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:07,849
So exposure group would be first of all,

244
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:17,780
level like amount of exposure within the Courtney 12 cohort and also comparing them to our quote unquote, unexposed myth cohort.

245
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:26,480
So the hypothesis here is that opiate exposure is intervening there, is interfering with the pi RNA binding site because so far,

246
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:32,180
most evidence is showing that, as I mentioned, parents are involved with regulating imprinted genes.

247
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:37,370
So if we see some difference in imprinted genes, we can deduce that there is some parent activity happening.

248
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:44,749
Okay, so what are we doing? It start with RNA samples prepared from human placenta tissue.

249
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:53,540
So folks in our lab have taken the actual placenta tissue that we received delivery and extracted.

250
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:58,160
Michael's nodding his head because he probably did some of that. No, I wouldn't be surprised.

251
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:02,059
Yeah. Extracted the RNA and prepare these.

252
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:10,820
And then I get to come in with these beautiful arti prepared samples and learn how to measure the expression level with a process called PCR.

253
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:18,170
So you might be familiar with PCR, which basically measures if something's being expressed or not, if a gene is being expressed or not.

254
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:24,709
Q PCR is a little more specific in that it can show actual expression quantification.

255
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:32,090
That's the key part. And then we can look at the opiate exposed versus non exposed expression levels

256
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:38,090
and see what this tells us about imprinted placenta placental gene expression.

257
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:44,569
Okay. So so far, I've just designed the primers for this and tested the primers.

258
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:49,610
They work well so far, but we now have to do all the actual data generation.

259
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:55,730
So my next steps are to run PCR on all the samples approximately 60.

260
00:29:55,730 --> 00:30:03,170
So shouldn't be too bad. And then explore methods to measure if Pioneer is actually present.

261
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:08,630
This is probably beyond the scope of my specific work, but in the larger context of the project it would be nice to say,

262
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:14,180
okay, we've already shown that there's a difference in expression. Now can we actually measure by RNA?

263
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:19,430
And then finally, main the broader goal of this work.

264
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:29,990
If we can identify how imprinted genes are regulated, we can then figure out potentially how to intervene because we saw how catastrophic,

265
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:38,120
even just one gene being dysregulated in the one imprinted gene being dysregulated can be for development.

266
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:41,390
So if there's a way to intervene, this could really be a powerful therapeutic.

267
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:52,640
I know. That's all I get. Yeah.

268
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:58,100
So you don't already have data supporting that these genes are regulated by pirate parties

269
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:02,330
or do you have any literature out there that shows that these groups can be regulated?

270
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:12,100
So that's a good question. So the reason that we chose these, where are they sorry, these these genes is because.

271
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:18,590
Oh, sunshine, thank you. I keep going to try to use a trackpad like.

272
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:28,400
Sorry about that. So the reason that we're choosing these genes are they're because they're from a region that was

273
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:33,889
recently published on by another group not our know anything really to us but that showed a very,

274
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:39,890
very very high level of pioneer specifically in the placenta from these genes.

275
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:46,010
So the theory at least is that, okay, if we know that there's a lot of pioneers,

276
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:53,600
we know that the parties are related in regulation and they're there in the placenta, then can we deduce that that's there, that that's their role?

277
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:58,910
And the the opioid piece of opiate exposure piece is that if there's a dysregulation,

278
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:06,470
then hopefully because we're looking at a specific gene that is so linked to RNA expression or irony.

279
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:13,490
Yeah. Like function then then that, that seems like a plausible connection, but I don't think it's been established.

280
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:30,220
Yes. Is there something more specific, something that why you choose the employers that are popular with consumers while appealing?

281
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:35,860
Yeah, that's a great question. Sure. So part of it is data availability.

282
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:40,420
Dr. Townsville's already part of the lab, so those samples are already available.

283
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:44,200
You know, we could do that analysis pretty. Pretty simply.

284
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:56,330
Another useful thing about this is that since we don't really know about this mechanism, it is helpful to choose a very, very strong disrupter.

285
00:32:56,350 --> 00:33:08,200
We can assume that taking a drug is going to be more likely to have this strong effect than, for example, comparing expression levels.

286
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:09,790
Because, for example, with the mythical cohort,

287
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:17,530
we could we could define them as exposed to things like P FAS or other endocrine disruptors disruptors or, you know, whatever.

288
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:20,500
I think metals are also measured in that cohort, so we could consider those.

289
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:25,570
But the effect size with environmental contaminants is usually very, very small.

290
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:34,120
So it's a more expeditious investigation to start with, a very, very strong what we would assume would have a strong effect.

291
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:38,510
That makes sense. Thank you. Yeah, sure. Please.

292
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:50,900
And if you completed the end of your research, that really is one of the factors that it's going to affect that imprint of the genes.

293
00:33:50,930 --> 00:34:03,290
Mm hmm. Then you would be able to say, Well, then we don't have to use that opioid, because opioid is not just like in the drug.

294
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:11,390
Just the problem is it just is, for example, people who had an injury and need some something, they.

295
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:15,950
They may give you some medication.

296
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:29,000
Yeah. But at the end, you say it's not permissible to have a within any kind of of medications that is going to affect in and jails.

297
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:39,080
I don't think we could draw that conclusion from this work because prescription use of opiates is still very well supported, despite, you know,

298
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:47,270
all the contention around opiates being addictive and, you know, all these companies not, you know, being nefarious in their prescribing practices.

299
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:54,890
That's a separate conversation. But I think there's still has to be a continuum, kind of like dose makes the poison thing.

300
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:58,100
I think there's a big difference between what we're what we would be testing

301
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:02,930
with people who are opiate abusers and then receiving a methadone treatment.

302
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:11,090
So that's all very well quantified and controlled versus somebody who received a prescription opioid for a short amount of time because they had,

303
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:15,740
you know, surgery when they were 19 and then they had a child seven years later.

304
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:19,820
So I think those kinds of things we really can't draw any conclusions from.

305
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:24,670
Yeah. Anybody else?

306
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:30,700
Yeah. So you said it's opioid exposure. Like during a specific time frame?

307
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:35,410
During a specific time frame in pregnancy. I think just to clarify on that,

308
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:41,469
the all of the participants had different timelines because it's it's basically the way that

309
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:46,810
enrollment has worked is if someone presents to clinic and they need this intervention,

310
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:55,300
it could be first trimester, it could be third trimester. So there is a varying degree of of opioid exposure even within the cohort.

311
00:35:55,640 --> 00:36:06,290
Yeah. So I'm not sure like data Y or power wise whether it will make sense to discriminate between those.

312
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:10,790
But I would assume we would want to.

313
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:19,260
Like first trimester and then methadone treatment versus, you know, no care until third trimester.

314
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:22,430
I think those would have very different. Yeah. Yeah.

315
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:27,410
When I worked for Wick, we did have people who never saw an obstetrician until right before they delivered.

316
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:31,520
They just didn't want to go to the doctor. They didn't have the resources. They didn't have the education, whatever it was.

317
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:39,270
So, yeah, exactly. Cool.

318
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:44,320
Thanks, everyone. Oh, my God.

319
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:49,120
Are you. Do you want it in this mode where you can do a present with you?

320
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:56,419
I don't want anything because I can. Just because right now I can switch it back to its external display.

321
00:36:56,420 --> 00:37:00,640
Or do you want it in their display? You're sorry?

322
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:12,950
Mm hmm. She used.

323
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:19,560
I saved my file here. But you should know that.

324
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,620
Yeah. Here. Here.

325
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:33,599
You just. I can this a little brother.

326
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:47,370
This is a short memory. I saved it so I can e-mail or I can use it.

327
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:53,490
Yeah, I think it doesn't save to the hard drive. Okay.

328
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:10,760
He's. I them.

329
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:54,260
And for that, you. All those people had three or four clean sheets.

330
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:09,879
Hello there, guys. Ready to play? My name is Hyoung Park Shannon.

331
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:13,250
I'm a second year of his students M.A. Lab.

332
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:19,719
Today, I'm here to present my previous research project with the topic on gestation

333
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:25,390
exposure to evaluate in relation to neurodevelopmental delays in early childhood.

334
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,410
Let me provide you some background.

335
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:41,430
Starting from phthalates, phthalates are widely used chemicals that are added to plastics or other personal care products such as soaps,

336
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:50,489
shampoos or hair sprays. Studies have found phthalates or endocrine disrupting chemicals so they can affect product systems,

337
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:55,530
thyroid hormone system, or they can increase the oxidative stress in our body.

338
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:02,730
As many of you already know, gestation is a critical period for baby's development,

339
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:09,390
so exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals during gestation can be associated with growth,

340
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:15,060
retardation, preterm birth, thyroid disruptions and even neurological disorders.

341
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:24,060
Specifically, neuro neurodevelopmental delays related to side exposures is important because early life and your

342
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:30,120
developmental delays tend to persist through the life course and may decide the quality of life.

343
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:35,790
So I work on a research project with Dr. Watkins.

344
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:46,920
With this research questions, is prenatal exposure to delays or delay replacements associated with child new developmental delay in early childhood?

345
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:51,000
And those six specificities exist in such relationships.

346
00:40:52,530 --> 00:41:03,570
To answer these questions, we designed our study to use the data from 274 mother and child pairs from the project birth cohort in Puerto Rico.

347
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:14,340
The exposure measured were the following metabolites measured in maternal urine samples at up to three timepoints during pregnancies.

348
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:24,540
Our outcome measures was neurodevelopmental status at age six, 12 or 24 months of age using the paddles.

349
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:33,180
Our development inventory set conditions to briefly explain about BVI two assessments.

350
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:41,010
These tests covers five different domains that addresses different aspects of child new developments.

351
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:53,070
Starting from motor domain, this domain assessed the ability to control and use the large and small muscles of personal social domains,

352
00:41:53,070 --> 00:42:00,600
assess the ability to engage in meaningfully meaningful associate direct interactions with adults and peers.

353
00:42:01,410 --> 00:42:10,650
Communication domains is their immediate ability to receives and expresses information and ideas through a verbal or a non-verbal means.

354
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:19,829
Cognitive domains assess the ability of attending to perceiving and processing information and other intellectual activities,

355
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:29,730
such as remembering, thinking and knowing. Lastly, adaptive domains examine the ability to use the information and skills acquired in other domains,

356
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:37,410
as were the statistical models we use similar to variable linear regressions.

357
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:45,240
Our primary predictor was geometric mean of individual metabolite concentrations across pregnancy.

358
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:56,190
Our outcome the child with no development status measured by the I2 domain scores that were added as continuous variables in the models.

359
00:42:56,940 --> 00:43:01,830
Our covariates include maternal age, maternal education and child age.

360
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:09,629
Additionally, we as we examined the sex specificity by including sex and exposures,

361
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:14,460
interaction term in the models and in case these interaction terms are significance.

362
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:19,380
We stratify the sample by s biological sex and run stratified models.

363
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:29,360
Here are the results. I know this feature is very information heavy, so let me provide some highlighted results.

364
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:38,260
So we found a child who knew a development across five aspects adaptive prisoner, social communication model and cognitive.

365
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:46,840
We're associated with various five metabolites at different ages and we found sex specificity is is for all time points.

366
00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:52,720
So in general always we found stronger associations among boys and girls.

367
00:43:53,980 --> 00:44:01,540
Interestingly, we are also a risk of fatality replacement type also showed that specific associations.

368
00:44:04,330 --> 00:44:12,520
One of the limitation of our analysis is because we have only a small number of individuals who have been measured more than one times.

369
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:22,690
So moving forward, we want to conduct a longitudinal study to see the impact of delayed exposures on child neurodevelopment trajectories,

370
00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:30,400
the impact of phthalates on a child neurodevelopment development change over time.

371
00:44:32,890 --> 00:44:40,090
To conclude, Justin, is this gestational exposure to phthalates and replacements was associated with your

372
00:44:40,090 --> 00:44:45,370
developmental delay across multiple domains with differences by sex and child ages.

373
00:44:46,370 --> 00:44:53,380
And so first, to reduce exposure in both individual and community levels are necessary.

374
00:44:54,970 --> 00:45:02,700
Thank you. Yeah.

375
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:10,110
Awesome job. I was wondering when you said that you would like to look at more longitudinal analysis.

376
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:14,430
Do you think that there is a specific window of susceptibility with that?

377
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:21,810
I don't really know how phthalates work. Do you think it's. Would your longitudinal study just be confined to a certain window?

378
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:27,000
And would that make a difference? Or are you trying to look at like just long term exposure?

379
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:31,210
I mean, do you mean the longitude?

380
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:34,680
I mean the different time points at exposures or different time?

381
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:39,370
Both at the whole. That's a good point. I guess I was thinking of exposure.

382
00:45:39,430 --> 00:45:43,800
Like, are you thinking of specific exposure to Windows? That's a good question.

383
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:55,230
But like our in our current study, populations of mothers have been collected their samples up to three times, but it varies from 1 to 3.

384
00:45:55,530 --> 00:46:00,390
So some mothers have only one time points. Measures like others is light up to three points.

385
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:09,030
The other issue is the timing is not exactly aligned with gestational trimester, let's say.

386
00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:17,440
So it's hard to yeah. Fix like specific terms or specific window of the exposure.

387
00:46:17,470 --> 00:46:21,440
But yeah, that's another interest.

388
00:46:21,450 --> 00:46:31,440
Like if we are, if we use on other samples or if we have more data availability moving forward, can, can phthalates still impact someone?

389
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:35,790
Like if the child's are already grown? Do you think they could play a role?

390
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:44,010
Do you mean like postnatal exposure yourself? Yeah, it may affect, but like most study only, I mean,

391
00:46:44,490 --> 00:46:54,330
current study tends to focus on prenatal exposures because gestation is important period for children's like brain development.

392
00:46:54,660 --> 00:47:02,480
So yes. But other studies are trying to see if there are some confounding effects, effects of postnatal exposures.

393
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:15,640
And what's the main source of valid exposure in the context for, uh, do you mean like the source of exposures?

394
00:47:15,970 --> 00:47:20,700
So it depends on the types of knowledge that there are like two types.

395
00:47:20,830 --> 00:47:24,210
High molecular solids and low molecular weight phthalates.

396
00:47:24,490 --> 00:47:29,680
So for the high molecular solids like plastics or like food packaging,

397
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:37,299
sort of these kind of plastic products are main source for the low molecular weight products.

398
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:39,790
The personal care products are the main sources.

399
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:47,799
And so far we found similar distributions of both high, high molecular weight and low molecular phthalates.

400
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:54,280
So we thought those are plastic products and personal care products matters for the exposure.

401
00:47:56,090 --> 00:48:00,040
So I have another one. Yeah. And this is urinary value of the table, right.

402
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:05,950
Uh, if you didn't have any constraints, like if you ran the project project,

403
00:48:06,070 --> 00:48:12,870
would you measure something else to assess the exposure or is the urinary metabolite the best source?

404
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:20,440
That's, that's not biomarker to my knowledge, but it can be only detected in urine.

405
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:24,270
People do not use for power. But correct me if I'm.

406
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:31,330
No, no, I don't know. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So that's why most studies use urinary flow.

407
00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:39,160
Yeah. Is it because studies have such a sampling of the urine is the best metrics to measure?

408
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:44,420
I think that's one of the reason. Thank you, Ron.

409
00:48:49,540 --> 00:49:01,270
Thank you. And then a couple of minutes over.

410
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:09,190
Thank you all so much for a great semester. It was really a pleasure working with you all and getting to know you a little bit better.

411
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:18,040
Good luck with the exams and everything and please let me know if there's anything I can do outside of class with help,

412
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:24,880
with other classes or research ideas or whatever you need. And I will be better about.
