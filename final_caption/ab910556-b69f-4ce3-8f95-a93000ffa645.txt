1
00:00:05,507 --> 00:00:09,103
So the inverted triangle structure
that we've been talking about is

2
00:00:09,103 --> 00:00:11,390
useful when you think about paragraphs.

3
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:15,180
But it's also useful when you're thinking
about the structure of your messages

4
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:17,384
at a big level, at a macro level.

5
00:00:17,384 --> 00:00:20,920
You wanna use the inverted
triangle structure

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:25,470
whenever the overall structure
of your message absolutely,

7
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:31,140
positively has to have the most
important point come first.

8
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,160
So where is this gonna happen?

9
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,830
When are you gonna really need
to make sure that your most

10
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:38,030
important point comes first?

11
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:43,770
One example that's commonly used is press
releases, so let me give you an example.

12
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,850
So here's a press release from
the University of Michigan about

13
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:52,830
a federal program that has been shown
to reduce hospital readmissions

14
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:56,390
that may have not been as
successful as it appears.

15
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:02,070
Notice that I basically just read
the first sentence of this press release.

16
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,470
All the additional information, and
it goes on much past what I cut out here,

17
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:10,270
are points that support that statement.

18
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:13,710
If that's all you get,
we're actually doing pretty well.

19
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:15,370
Here's another example.

20
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:19,809
An after-school program that empowers
young people to be agents of change in

21
00:01:19,809 --> 00:01:24,456
their communities has helped 8th-grade
students in one Michigan area develop

22
00:01:24,456 --> 00:01:28,990
more prosocial behaviors and
avoid antisocial behaviors.

23
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:30,207
Sounds cool, right?

24
00:01:30,207 --> 00:01:32,016
I wanna know more about this program,

25
00:01:32,016 --> 00:01:35,200
and that's exactly what a press
release is supposed to do.

26
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:41,550
It's supposed to get its core idea across
in a way that makes you want to know more,

27
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:45,900
want to read more about the details,
want to learn more about the study.

28
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,950
And so the design of a press release,
almost always,

29
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:57,120
tries to make sure that its core point,
the lead, has that central message.

30
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:01,510
Now, inverted triangle structure is
not just useful for press releases.

31
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:05,035
It's also useful any time you
need to make what's often called

32
00:02:05,035 --> 00:02:06,641
an elevator pitch, right?

33
00:02:06,641 --> 00:02:11,986
You wanna get your most important
point out right up front.

34
00:02:11,986 --> 00:02:16,157
It's also something that you should be
trained to think about if you're ever

35
00:02:16,157 --> 00:02:17,510
gonna be interviewed.

36
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,600
Now, I've gone through
interview training so

37
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,610
that I can be interviewed by
journalists about my research,

38
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:27,210
about the kinds of health issues
that we are communicating about.

39
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:32,650
And the challenge is to find that
sound bite, that one sentence

40
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:37,750
central message that I wanna make
sure the journalist picks up on.

41
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:41,320
That's the thing they want to pull out
when they're writing up their story, or

42
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:45,570
even showing the interview,
if I'm being interviewed on video.

43
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:49,395
Here's a different kind of example,
medical discharge instructions.

44
00:02:49,395 --> 00:02:54,349
If I've got a patient whose leaving say
the emergency department, and they have to

45
00:02:54,349 --> 00:02:58,738
do certain behaviors in order to prevent
infection or to keep taking their

46
00:02:58,738 --> 00:03:03,900
medications, I want to make sure that
those instructions are right up front.

47
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:10,720
The details can follow, but they better
know those critical instructions.

48
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,940
Grant proposals,

49
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:15,910
I'm gonna keep talking about how
important specific aims pages are.

50
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,594
What's the specific aims page?

51
00:03:17,594 --> 00:03:23,005
The first part of maybe dozens of pages,
maybe hundreds of pages

52
00:03:23,005 --> 00:03:28,780
of a grant proposal or
a larger proposal is about the core idea.

53
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,070
The central message.

54
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:33,410
The why should I care about this.

55
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:36,650
And so thinking about that
inverted triangle structure,

56
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:39,840
helps make sure that I
get my point across.

57
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,556
And that somebody doesn't have to
read 10 or 20 pages before they

58
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:47,291
know why they might want to care
about whatever it is I'm proposing.

59
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:51,106
When the absolute clarity of
your key point is critical,

60
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:53,966
inverted triangle is
often the best bet for

61
00:03:53,966 --> 00:04:00,307
making sure that people get that one
critical point that they have to know.
