1
00:00:03,597 --> 00:00:15,357
Hi everyone and thank you for your patience as we figure out our IT for this first in-person and Zoom hybrid session of the EPID seminar series.

2
00:00:16,287 --> 00:00:18,897
It's my pleasure today to introduce Mark Reiser.

3
00:00:19,137 --> 00:00:26,517
My producer is an assistant professor in population health sciences and mathematics at Duke University and is a member of the Duke Cancer Institute.

4
00:00:27,057 --> 00:00:32,037
Marc conducts research in early cancer detection with a particular focus on breast cancer,

5
00:00:32,817 --> 00:00:36,717
overdiagnosis and overtreatment, uses, multiscale approaches,

6
00:00:37,167 --> 00:00:45,357
and his group generates and analyzes biologic, clinical and population data using a variety of mathematical, testable and conversational tools.

7
00:00:46,077 --> 00:00:51,357
I first met Marc in 2015 at an interdisciplinary conference on viruses.

8
00:00:52,107 --> 00:00:56,697
And ever since then, I've been very impressed with Marc's ability to bridge the biological clinical

9
00:00:56,697 --> 00:01:01,977
aspects and use computational modeling to develop policy relevant research.

10
00:01:02,367 --> 00:01:05,487
Please join me in welcoming Marc Reiser.

11
00:01:11,347 --> 00:01:16,617
Thank you very much. Really nice to be back in person.

12
00:01:17,127 --> 00:01:24,267
The same problems are continuous to I. So yeah, it's great to see old friends and make new ones here.

13
00:01:25,047 --> 00:01:30,537
Thanks for coming to the talk. So we're running a little behind already, so I'm going to get started.

14
00:01:31,587 --> 00:01:36,557
Okay. Today, I'm going to talk, broadly speaking, about breast cancer overdiagnosis and overtreatment.

15
00:01:36,567 --> 00:01:42,267
And I'm going to structure my topic to four parts just briefly to make sure everybody is on the same page,

16
00:01:42,267 --> 00:01:48,667
both the fine things and tragedies, the problem and expense as indicated by both.

17
00:01:49,167 --> 00:01:57,777
Most of the time, the question of how much and then even more mechanistic, biological general mechanisms there why question.

18
00:01:58,707 --> 00:02:08,877
And I'll close out of them just a few snippets of our work in how to reduce our diagnosis and in particular, overtreatment in the clinic.

19
00:02:10,887 --> 00:02:20,307
Right. So just before we get started, this will be relevant, especially in the second part of the talk,

20
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:26,367
but it's very good to know this all along is just a basic principle of the anatomy of the female breasts that we have.

21
00:02:28,397 --> 00:02:39,047
Basically this trauma, this fatty tissue, as indicated in the picture and all of the epithelial cells, they are in this manner ductal treated.

22
00:02:39,057 --> 00:02:49,167
So at the nipple all these branches converge and then they find out this binary branching tree structure at the end of the tree's activity,

23
00:02:49,187 --> 00:02:55,947
so to speak, or any sort of globules. And that's where the milk is produced during lactation and the dust themselves.

24
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,407
You see a cross-section here.

25
00:02:58,217 --> 00:03:07,097
They are in normal, healthy breast, are, are and because they are the conduits for the breast milk to reach the nipple sort of lactation.

26
00:03:07,367 --> 00:03:13,427
So that's how it looks like the normal breast. Now, let's not back to the early eighties.

27
00:03:13,907 --> 00:03:25,306
I've just given here a caricature of how people thought about breast cancer, many cancers in general, how they view race.

28
00:03:25,307 --> 00:03:28,696
And so people thought about it as you start with the little dot,

29
00:03:28,697 --> 00:03:35,957
and then it is followed by these pretty basic lesions where there are malignant cells around,

30
00:03:35,957 --> 00:03:42,617
but they grow within the dogs, they stay within the dogs. And as such, this is not a life threatening disease.

31
00:03:42,947 --> 00:03:49,967
It's only once you have progression to invasive cancer. What is these cells that breach the basement membrane and go outside of it?

32
00:03:49,967 --> 00:03:53,327
Dogs penetrate tissue and can go into the system.

33
00:03:53,597 --> 00:03:57,917
That's when it becomes potentially life threatening as metastatic, metastatic disease.

34
00:03:58,877 --> 00:04:10,786
So with this picture in mind, you know, mammography screening was introduced and is very appealing because is you have these three invasive lesions.

35
00:04:10,787 --> 00:04:18,057
So if you screen a lot, you can catch both early on and treat aggressively and early and eventually save lives.

36
00:04:18,077 --> 00:04:21,407
So that was the central tenet of screening. So it is, of course.

37
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:27,537
And so, you know, does it work?

38
00:04:27,557 --> 00:04:30,317
Mammography screening? Yes. Yes, of course it does.

39
00:04:31,257 --> 00:04:39,047
You know, there's no guideline that recommends to not do mammography screening, at least for a select group of women.

40
00:04:39,497 --> 00:04:42,706
And yet, you know, there's some interesting questions that come out of it.

41
00:04:42,707 --> 00:04:49,277
Right. Because while it does reduce mortality, breast cancer, specific mortality, sort of questions about potential downsides.

42
00:04:49,817 --> 00:04:52,997
And that's what I'm going to talk about mostly today.

43
00:04:53,027 --> 00:04:55,606
So let's let's go back to the early eighties.

44
00:04:55,607 --> 00:05:02,297
And I'm giving you just like the baseline rates there at the beginning of incidence for the disease and the invasive components.

45
00:05:02,777 --> 00:05:08,447
And here's a question for you. Before you fall asleep, what do you expect to happen here?

46
00:05:10,057 --> 00:05:14,937
What is what is the DCS compartment going to do? Yes.

47
00:05:16,337 --> 00:05:20,217
Anyway, shut it out. It's going on. It should go off.

48
00:05:20,247 --> 00:05:23,987
Right? What about the invasive compact? What would you like it to do?

49
00:05:26,057 --> 00:05:29,776
Eventually go down, right, to make you see an increase beginning.

50
00:05:29,777 --> 00:05:36,817
But once they get to the stationary stage, it should go down. Now, the good news is here for geeks, the good and the bad news is pretty easy.

51
00:05:36,977 --> 00:05:45,106
That's the case. So indeed, this is essentially a manmade and these are very, very low incidents before.

52
00:05:45,107 --> 00:05:52,727
But now it is creating and it went up by quite a magnitude after introduction of a lot of screening.

53
00:05:52,967 --> 00:05:59,717
Now, in the basic compartment, they didn't quite see what we were hoping to see.

54
00:05:59,807 --> 00:06:01,997
I mean, I didn't know of anything back then. It was a problem.

55
00:06:01,997 --> 00:06:08,727
But, you know, folks are expecting it to go up and then come hopefully down below baseline, but it's not really star.

56
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:16,887
Now, what about that, Bob? Like, what is going on? Why isn't it doing what folks would expect we're expecting it to do.

57
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:22,057
And that's a tricky question. And a lot of people thought about it a lot.

58
00:06:22,197 --> 00:06:30,207
Papers have been written about it and it's know it's hard to be pinpoint, but because there are so many confronting issues, first of all,

59
00:06:30,387 --> 00:06:35,427
the uncertain baseline trends that all of the trends have been in,

60
00:06:35,427 --> 00:06:40,946
cancer incidence had come out of the screen and not been introduced and we believe that there would have been an increase.

61
00:06:40,947 --> 00:06:45,567
But how much? Not knowing that makes it hard to disentangle everything else.

62
00:06:46,167 --> 00:06:53,697
There's the issue of hormone replacement therapy that was quite prevalent in the nineties, who discontinued what is associated with breast cancer.

63
00:06:54,987 --> 00:07:04,457
And of course, there's the question should go up and it may did it come down as we detect cancers that are true cancers?

64
00:07:04,467 --> 00:07:06,597
So we're not talking about false positives here, true cancers,

65
00:07:06,597 --> 00:07:13,627
but they were so indolent that they just would not have actually transitioned to the progressive environment.

66
00:07:14,397 --> 00:07:17,487
And that's what in a nutshell we can call overdiagnosis.

67
00:07:17,487 --> 00:07:24,537
So let's take it down from this population level curve to a specific individual person's life history.

68
00:07:24,807 --> 00:07:31,787
Let's assume a woman is diagnosed as has onset of asymptomatic disease at a time one and so she doesn't know about it.

69
00:07:31,997 --> 00:07:36,826
Just some tumor starts growing. There's a period of tumor vacancy.

70
00:07:36,827 --> 00:07:42,497
And so in the absence of a screening and the absence of death from an unrelated cause,

71
00:07:43,287 --> 00:07:48,317
there will be a time to where this tumor would become clinical and symptomatic writer.

72
00:07:49,737 --> 00:07:58,407
Now what happens if screening is introduced? Juxtapose those juxtaposed checks in position.

73
00:08:00,307 --> 00:08:05,267
Okay. It's just a position onto this. Just the position.

74
00:08:06,267 --> 00:08:13,737
Yeah. Yeah, that's right. This is now used as a net asset.

75
00:08:14,007 --> 00:08:18,777
So what happens if you have another graphic depiction of that tumor year time frame?

76
00:08:20,307 --> 00:08:26,037
What are the potential contracts? Right. Because we still are all subject to dying at some point.

77
00:08:26,307 --> 00:08:27,777
So in one scenario.

78
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:37,377
Cancer woman died from unrelated cause was struck by lightning, a time for which was before the tumor would have gone on to be present at the clinic.

79
00:08:38,387 --> 00:08:43,337
And that is exactly the case that we call overdiagnosed, because that one was detected and treated.

80
00:08:43,337 --> 00:08:50,417
But it was, you know, to no benefit because it would never have caused any issues if struck by lightning.

81
00:08:50,837 --> 00:08:58,816
You know, it was later was after time to then. That's not overdiagnosed, too, because she would have been diagnosed later than the advanced diagnosis.

82
00:08:58,817 --> 00:09:04,037
It could potentially, you know, increase her life expectancy.

83
00:09:05,857 --> 00:09:11,357
Putting it in words sober diagnosis. Here is the classic graphic infection of breast cancer that will not have cost

84
00:09:11,377 --> 00:09:16,237
symptoms or terms in the woman's remaining lifetime and the old treatment.

85
00:09:16,237 --> 00:09:21,577
Is that all corollary to this? If the treatment of an overdiagnosed cancer.

86
00:09:23,907 --> 00:09:28,377
So already you can see this is a counterfactual outcome, right?

87
00:09:28,557 --> 00:09:34,597
So what would have happened had she not undergone treatments? And so that, you know, in itself makes it a tricky thing to estimate.

88
00:09:34,627 --> 00:09:39,717
So. This picture here really nicely illustrates this trickiness.

89
00:09:39,717 --> 00:09:47,427
So this is a systematic review where folks pull together estimates from the literature of how much overdiagnosis there is.

90
00:09:47,427 --> 00:09:53,517
And you can survive a very wide range here, going from none at all to over 50%.

91
00:09:54,837 --> 00:10:01,916
And that picture here, you know, if you want to make policy in it, you need type all the evidence.

92
00:10:01,917 --> 00:10:05,757
And it's hard to to make policy with such a picture here now.

93
00:10:05,787 --> 00:10:08,067
But why do we have so much variability? Well.

94
00:10:09,227 --> 00:10:19,457
They are an issue that is supposed to be clear or transparent about what exactly they call overdiagnosis with different denominators, etc.

95
00:10:19,757 --> 00:10:25,697
That should be, you know, not an issue, but it can be an issue in practice because there is no this disparity.

96
00:10:26,237 --> 00:10:32,657
Bigger issues, of course, are different populations, different geographic regions, different settings,

97
00:10:32,657 --> 00:10:39,967
different clinical workflows like, you know, follow up diagnostic imaging and referral to biopsy practices make it different.

98
00:10:39,977 --> 00:10:44,147
And that all has an impact of the overdiagnosis, overdiagnosis rate.

99
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,317
And then, you know,

100
00:10:45,347 --> 00:10:54,617
probably the here is the point here is that the methodologies that use it are different methods and they gave quite different estimates.

101
00:10:55,337 --> 00:10:59,177
Let's quickly look at the methods here to set the stage for the work.

102
00:10:59,177 --> 00:11:00,887
I'm going to just show you in a second.

103
00:11:02,087 --> 00:11:10,366
You know, broadly speaking, it's a it's a there's two different cancer methodologies in overdiagnosis estimation.

104
00:11:10,367 --> 00:11:20,087
So there is the excess incidence camp. And then the idea there being to say while we look at basically 80 seconds of tumors in

105
00:11:20,087 --> 00:11:25,427
unscreened screen populations and we use that to to weed out how much was overdiagnosed,

106
00:11:25,427 --> 00:11:34,126
it sounds very appealing. If you dive into it, it's actually quite tricky, you know, and it was shown in work,

107
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:46,637
but it's a different philosophy and it's only that in most cases you will actually overestimate the overdiagnosis rate with this method here.

108
00:11:46,637 --> 00:11:50,697
So there's an inherent bias. The other candidates are model based.

109
00:11:51,027 --> 00:11:55,967
So here we really we acknowledge and fully acknowledge the kind of factual nature.

110
00:11:55,977 --> 00:12:01,797
So what we do is we first learn the truth of our natural history from incidents and spending patterns,

111
00:12:02,127 --> 00:12:10,327
and then we overlay the data to screening patterns in a specific population

112
00:12:10,587 --> 00:12:15,597
and predict the overdiagnosis rate and make critiques of this this approach,

113
00:12:15,597 --> 00:12:19,466
where we mostly the models can become very quickly, not transparent.

114
00:12:19,467 --> 00:12:26,247
So it's it's hard to evaluate and judge what the potential biases are of these approaches.

115
00:12:26,457 --> 00:12:32,397
And also interesting assumptions that have been criticized, such as all breast tumors will breast invasive cancer.

116
00:12:35,147 --> 00:12:41,536
And so our work really was kind of building up on these knowledge state of limitations.

117
00:12:41,537 --> 00:12:45,677
And we really tried to, to, to come up with ways to.

118
00:12:46,777 --> 00:12:54,337
To mitigate some of these issues and also to to use data to be relevant for the U.S. setting in a contemporary practice.

119
00:12:54,707 --> 00:13:01,297
And we started more with theoretical work, looking at the identify ability issues and the limitations,

120
00:13:01,687 --> 00:13:08,557
the past and how much can you actually learn from from screening data in a trial or observational cohort setting?

121
00:13:08,797 --> 00:13:15,967
And then we we translated that into practice by estimating the overdiagnosis in May in a US screening cohort,

122
00:13:16,327 --> 00:13:22,057
and that was worked on the set with Etzioni and different RJ Lange is now which as

123
00:13:22,117 --> 00:13:29,767
you and I also learned a lot in this process and got really great input from work.

124
00:14:08,437 --> 00:14:12,916
All right. So we're doing this in two steps. So in the first step, as I alluded to before,

125
00:14:12,917 --> 00:14:23,027
we learn disease dynamics and there's infants going on and then we basically predict what the diagnosis rate is based on the infant's natural history.

126
00:14:23,687 --> 00:14:28,696
For that step one, of course, the high quality data and we were fortunate to collaborate with colleagues at

127
00:14:28,697 --> 00:14:33,617
the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium talking about that in the next slide.

128
00:14:33,857 --> 00:14:41,327
So we combine that with mathematical models of disease dynamics and before Bayesian inference to come out with

129
00:14:41,777 --> 00:14:48,827
a a our best estimate of what the underlying process is so that we can then predict the overdiagnosis rate.

130
00:14:49,427 --> 00:14:56,387
And the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium is a representative, the cohort of US breast cancer screening population.

131
00:14:56,657 --> 00:15:02,747
So you can see it's here on a map. It's, it's sampling in different states and different geographic regions.

132
00:15:03,017 --> 00:15:06,076
And most importantly, it's really linked to the tumor registries, right?

133
00:15:06,077 --> 00:15:08,837
So we have cancer outcomes as well.

134
00:15:09,947 --> 00:15:22,487
In this study here, we include women 50 to 74 years, which corresponds to the, you know, the average risk screening age group from the task force.

135
00:15:22,487 --> 00:15:30,917
So that that was our motivation for this. And we included only women with deferred screening in a DCC facility between 2000 to 2018.

136
00:15:31,607 --> 00:15:33,957
Now, why do we want them to have the first screening there?

137
00:15:33,977 --> 00:15:42,287
Well, because if you don't know their previous screening history, we can't really estimate their the natural history from their life trajectories.

138
00:15:43,867 --> 00:15:48,457
I'm not going to go into details here, just letting me know. It's about 36,000 women.

139
00:15:49,327 --> 00:15:55,947
Just over 80,000 screens in total. 718 cancers detected, most of them screen detected.

140
00:15:55,957 --> 00:16:01,207
So that that was a data we work with. And the structure of the data is really at the individual level.

141
00:16:01,537 --> 00:16:11,257
So for every woman, we had essentially a trajectory that looked like either like this here where she just had a series of negative screens.

142
00:16:12,337 --> 00:16:18,867
Or she had a series of negative screens, followed by a positive screen that was confirmed as being a breast cancer.

143
00:16:19,447 --> 00:16:27,227
Or she had a series of negative screens and then a cancer diagnosis that was not associated with a positive mammogram.

144
00:16:27,247 --> 00:16:31,566
So we call that a clinical cancer. Some folks call it an intimate cancer.

145
00:16:31,567 --> 00:16:35,967
Yes, it's. No, we did not.

146
00:16:36,207 --> 00:16:39,597
No. Okay.

147
00:16:40,177 --> 00:16:46,206
So the natural history ball that we were looking at was the slight modification

148
00:16:46,207 --> 00:16:52,447
augmentation from the way in this folks model in the past and this in this space.

149
00:16:52,717 --> 00:16:54,696
So we didn't just have this upper branch,

150
00:16:54,697 --> 00:17:02,287
which is the classical branch of an onset of screen detectable disease and then symptomatic presentation at the tumor latency.

151
00:17:02,497 --> 00:17:04,626
We also allowed for this bottom branch,

152
00:17:04,627 --> 00:17:13,057
which is acknowledging the sense that we come to realize that a lot of these early stage tumors may actually be not progressing.

153
00:17:13,057 --> 00:17:16,956
So we just wanted to have this flexibility in the model and we looked at the

154
00:17:16,957 --> 00:17:23,347
identifiable properties of this and quite in some detail in this earlier paper.

155
00:17:24,547 --> 00:17:29,887
And what we did is we take those screening histories, we use basic tools.

156
00:17:30,127 --> 00:17:38,377
We were standard, if you're interested in the details and we did inference on these stochastic models to try to estimate the parameters.

157
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:45,997
And now that we had a nice parameter model and you know, the full year, so we also had uncertainty quantified in there.

158
00:17:46,297 --> 00:17:52,327
We can go to the next step and say, okay, based on what we've learned, what can we say about the rate of overdiagnosis?

159
00:17:52,927 --> 00:18:03,117
And here we need to remember that overdiagnosis has been this competition between clinical diagnosis from death versus dying.

160
00:18:03,127 --> 00:18:07,526
It's not a clinical diagnosis versus dying from an unrelated cause, whichever comes first.

161
00:18:07,527 --> 00:18:14,077
So it's this competition procedure that we can we can we can leverage to predict the overdiagnosis rate.

162
00:18:15,067 --> 00:18:23,377
We use biennial screening through the ages of 50 and 74 because again, that's the task or task force recommendation for At-risk women.

163
00:18:25,467 --> 00:18:29,277
And I'm just going to jump right to the results here for the overdiagnosis.

164
00:18:29,307 --> 00:18:37,077
So the overall rate among screened detected cancers, and that's important to emphasize because as I told you earlier, you know,

165
00:18:37,077 --> 00:18:45,537
sometimes people define it as all cancers to we look at just if a cancer screen detected, what is the probability it is overdiagnosed?

166
00:18:45,867 --> 00:18:53,247
And we found about 15%. As you can see, there is quite a bit of residual uncertainty in these estimates that goes that stems from the fact that

167
00:18:53,247 --> 00:19:00,957
we aren't we aren't able to estimate with high precision the the natural the underlying natural history.

168
00:19:02,677 --> 00:19:08,556
And the nice thing about this, this approach where we split the progressive, progressive and progressive,

169
00:19:08,557 --> 00:19:13,716
we can kind of look at where the attributable fractions of those two tumor types.

170
00:19:13,717 --> 00:19:21,097
And we found that about a third of those 56 would be coming from the intellectuals that just don't progress.

171
00:19:21,427 --> 00:19:26,917
And about 9% as an average here over his age range is due to progressive cancers.

172
00:19:26,927 --> 00:19:31,477
That just it becomes symptomatic before death from an unrelated cause.

173
00:19:34,137 --> 00:19:37,407
Good and important. Now to put this into perspective.

174
00:19:37,407 --> 00:19:45,957
Right. I picked out from that scatterplot in the beginning studies that are comparable in terms of definition and also the age range.

175
00:19:46,377 --> 00:19:55,287
And as you can see here on the left of our estimates are all the red dots which are model based estimates and they tend to be lower in general.

176
00:19:55,467 --> 00:20:03,297
And on the right are the excess incidence based estimates and especially the last one there.

177
00:20:04,287 --> 00:20:12,387
It's actually not comparable because this is a one day estimated 31% among all breast cancers, which if you translate that to screen detected,

178
00:20:12,387 --> 00:20:19,857
you get close to one in two demographically detected cancers that would be overdiagnosed, which is just seems rather unrealistic.

179
00:20:20,067 --> 00:20:27,296
But this paper, unfortunately, has dominated the the conversation around this topic over the past decade.

180
00:20:27,297 --> 00:20:37,767
And I'd say this with a strong motivational attitude to try to rectify that and come up with an estimate that is more defensible.

181
00:20:39,917 --> 00:20:44,717
We do have invitations in here. You know, we don't have family history.

182
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:50,207
We don't have a lot of things in here because as you can see, it's already hard to estimate the things we try to estimate.

183
00:20:50,527 --> 00:20:55,007
And we are definitely working on, you know, mitigating these limitations.

184
00:20:55,007 --> 00:21:00,046
So one thing is we want to do is one of the things basically and see Tunisia taken

185
00:21:00,047 --> 00:21:05,957
together at this point and we want to potentially go to molecular suspects as well,

186
00:21:06,827 --> 00:21:14,806
because that, of course, matters as well. And then the other thing is, you know, patient features, but there's breast density and definitely race.

187
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:22,487
We've seen in recent studies that mammography screening in black men and women and women of color in general and black women in particular,

188
00:21:22,997 --> 00:21:30,257
there are other benefit arm ratios that might lead to or should lead to different policy recommendations.

189
00:21:30,257 --> 00:21:35,027
And so focusing on such questions, I think, is going to be very important part of our future work.

190
00:21:35,387 --> 00:21:39,887
And because that, you know, brings methodological challenges here,

191
00:21:39,907 --> 00:21:48,437
I'm working with two statistics folks in this department, Jason Su and Rafael, his students.

192
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:55,487
And we're working on building custom samplers for these problems, to look at the models and gain more insight.

193
00:21:56,717 --> 00:22:02,867
So just kind of getting to the conclusion of this part of my talk to the more epi population level.

194
00:22:03,227 --> 00:22:13,787
So previous modeling approach that can criticize various aspects including not having non progressive to and so we try to kind of really be mindful,

195
00:22:13,827 --> 00:22:18,796
thoughtful about addressing these issues in our approach.

196
00:22:18,797 --> 00:22:27,047
And I think very importantly using a contemporary U.S. cohort where we have individual level data, not just population aggregate data.

197
00:22:27,047 --> 00:22:35,887
So I think we've made some headway there methodologically and we find that about one in seven screen effective cancers will be overdiagnosed.

198
00:22:35,897 --> 00:22:39,187
Now, of course, that's an average over population, right?

199
00:22:39,467 --> 00:22:45,107
It will be higher among older and sicker patients and it's definitely lower among younger and healthier women.

200
00:22:45,437 --> 00:22:49,546
So that's something to keep in mind. And again, as I set the course,

201
00:22:49,547 --> 00:23:00,737
definitely that is considerably lower our estimate and influential prior studies that have really dominated the conversation around this topic.

202
00:23:02,927 --> 00:23:10,487
Yeah. So now we're getting. Slowly into the second part of the talk.

203
00:23:11,477 --> 00:23:17,887
Why you know, why is that important? Right now, we know say one in seven is overdiagnosed.

204
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:21,437
And I think it's a there's two there's two parts where it's a it's very important.

205
00:23:21,437 --> 00:23:30,167
So the first one is prescreening. So healthy women to screen or not to screen both at the policy level and at the individual woman level,

206
00:23:30,647 --> 00:23:41,626
where the decisions have to be made based on the balance of fewer cancer deaths and mortality benefits and the potential harms of screening,

207
00:23:41,627 --> 00:23:49,457
which are not just false positive mammograms, but also overdiagnosis, which is.

208
00:23:51,147 --> 00:24:01,407
Okay. Right. And then once you know, somebody has undergone screening and been diagnosed with breast cancer, what what does it mean?

209
00:24:01,417 --> 00:24:08,427
Right. It means because currently, basically, all patients diagnosed with breast cancer get treatment even a very early stage.

210
00:24:08,427 --> 00:24:12,137
Once every overdiagnosed cancer will be an overtreated cancer.

211
00:24:12,147 --> 00:24:18,536
So this now trickles down to one in seven women will be subject to the harms like diagnosed women

212
00:24:18,537 --> 00:24:22,017
with diagnosed cancer will be subject to the harms of the treatment without deriving any benefit.

213
00:24:22,257 --> 00:24:29,427
So then it becomes a question of how much treatment should be administered in each case.

214
00:24:29,447 --> 00:24:39,447
So these are these are the areas where, you know, having higher quality evidence kind of starts to, you know, help people make better decisions and.

215
00:24:41,387 --> 00:24:47,207
Good, but so why not quantify how much overdiagnosis there is right at the population level?

216
00:24:47,537 --> 00:24:53,337
Now, let's drill down a little bit more, which is that what is the driver of overdiagnosis and.

217
00:24:54,747 --> 00:24:58,946
And to that end, I want to go back to the picture I've shown in the beginning.

218
00:24:58,947 --> 00:25:05,637
Right. I think looking at this picture here with Fisher shooting up very early, I think that's a good candidate.

219
00:25:06,027 --> 00:25:10,977
That's a there's high suspicion here that that will be a big driver because the increase in

220
00:25:10,977 --> 00:25:17,277
these did not really translate into the expected decrease in the invasive cancer incidence.

221
00:25:17,287 --> 00:25:24,357
So while being far from, you know, definitive proof here and so this gives you a first idea of where where to look at.

222
00:25:24,367 --> 00:25:29,937
Right. You definitely want to go look at stage four metastatic cancer cells, candidates for overdiagnosis.

223
00:25:30,927 --> 00:25:40,177
And so we've done a lot of work in in this area trying to really understand, to find evidence, looking at these, yes.

224
00:25:40,437 --> 00:25:49,627
Women diagnosed with disease, what would the risk be of invasive progression if they didn't undergo a treatment?

225
00:25:49,677 --> 00:25:57,566
And it's quite hard to find because, as I said, most women do undergo treatment, surgery or radiation treatments and therapy, whatnot.

226
00:25:57,567 --> 00:26:02,207
So it's very unusual that women not undergoing surgery.

227
00:26:02,217 --> 00:26:06,987
So nevertheless, we were able to find small subsets of that and say, see out here.

228
00:26:06,987 --> 00:26:14,217
And we're also doing other studies. But I'm just showing you this study here where we looked at about 1200 some patients

229
00:26:14,577 --> 00:26:19,797
diagnosed with these who didn't get local regional treatment upon diagnosis.

230
00:26:20,037 --> 00:26:26,967
And we we estimated the incidence of ipsilateral breast invasive cancer over time.

231
00:26:27,507 --> 00:26:31,316
And as you can see, we're going out here ten, 15, 20 years and it stays.

232
00:26:31,317 --> 00:26:39,747
It's quite limited, right. So flipping it on its head, you know, given that all of those patients generally in the population do get treatment,

233
00:26:39,747 --> 00:26:45,987
about three out of four would be over treated, would receive treatment without deriving any benefit.

234
00:26:47,067 --> 00:26:54,057
So there is a good indication that disease is the main driver of breast cancer overdiagnosis.

235
00:26:54,507 --> 00:27:02,546
Now, there is a little bit of a few hundred here, and it's quite it's it's quite a hot topic in this field.

236
00:27:02,547 --> 00:27:07,467
It's kind of, you know, how do we know if this has actually been progress?

237
00:27:07,557 --> 00:27:14,046
And the big conundrum about the latency of X is, you know, first of all, they're really similar to invasive cancers.

238
00:27:14,047 --> 00:27:22,917
Like people have looked at it from all angles, like pathology, genomics, proteomics, and they they look almost indistinguishable from breast cancer.

239
00:27:22,917 --> 00:27:26,327
So it really makes people think, you know, first of all,

240
00:27:26,347 --> 00:27:34,467
supports the notion to give treatment to everybody right away because it looks so similar and with all respect, with all the different comparisons.

241
00:27:34,737 --> 00:27:39,227
And also it gives this notion of all of these years, it's just one little step away from invasion.

242
00:27:39,237 --> 00:27:43,577
It just misses the key to get out of this ductal system and invade.

243
00:27:45,787 --> 00:27:51,937
But the evidence that we've been gathering at the more epidemiologic population level indicates

244
00:27:51,937 --> 00:27:57,907
that many of these patients would actually not develop ipsilateral invasive disease.

245
00:27:58,237 --> 00:28:06,277
So, you know, if you kind of do a rough calculation, this may lead up to 40,000 women in the U.S. each year being overdiagnosed with these tests.

246
00:28:06,667 --> 00:28:17,157
So it's quite it's quite the apparent contradiction between this proximity to invasive cancer, but it's also it's low propensity to progress.

247
00:28:17,167 --> 00:28:22,327
So we have been very interested in trying to understand this problem more.

248
00:28:22,657 --> 00:28:25,927
And that brought us more. Brings us now to the world of biology.

249
00:28:26,557 --> 00:28:31,837
I want to explore what are the mechanistic kind of dynamics that take place at the cellular level?

250
00:28:32,347 --> 00:28:39,517
Can we learn from from these growth dynamics about how to to think about this this conundrum?

251
00:28:40,617 --> 00:28:56,837
If you have questions, I will start on the ground and answer because it's always very it's.

252
00:28:58,047 --> 00:29:02,367
I didn't say that. What would you mean by role playing? Like mammograms?

253
00:29:04,947 --> 00:29:09,987
Mammograms. Is it like the radiation? Yeah, it's radiation.

254
00:29:09,987 --> 00:29:14,817
Right? Right. Yeah. No, I think the doses would not be kind of like.

255
00:29:15,957 --> 00:29:20,937
You're thinking life is getting to regular mammogram, actually increasing your breast cancer risk?

256
00:29:21,237 --> 00:29:25,247
Yeah, that's a thought. I don't think there's any evidence to support that.

257
00:29:25,527 --> 00:29:31,477
Yeah, but at the frequency of dose of radiation that women get every year or two years.

258
00:29:36,057 --> 00:29:40,217
So. Yes. So back out to biology here.

259
00:29:40,227 --> 00:29:46,097
So what happens between that first cell and the observed tumor at diagnosis?

260
00:29:46,107 --> 00:29:49,737
Right. And that's the only time where we look at it because women get treated.

261
00:29:49,737 --> 00:29:54,777
So you do not have you can't look at how a tumor will develop in a person.

262
00:29:54,807 --> 00:30:03,477
So all you get is the surgical specimen. And we wanted to use techniques, developed techniques to find out how these tumors broke,

263
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:07,347
because that could give us important clues about this conundrum of latency.

264
00:30:07,557 --> 00:30:17,607
This is work with breast surgeon Dr. Wong at Duke, pathologist Dr. Shibata at USC, and Geoffrey Marks, who is a cancer biologist.

265
00:30:17,967 --> 00:30:25,977
And also a lot of the work was done here at together with Matt Greenwald, who's a recent graduate from Duke.

266
00:30:27,647 --> 00:30:30,827
So how do we go about understanding these programs?

267
00:30:30,827 --> 00:30:37,126
And all we see is a tumor, as it was diagnosed at one time points out, in surrogate dynamics.

268
00:30:37,127 --> 00:30:45,377
And so I'd like to bring up this analogy from, you know, the way people study human migrations way back.

269
00:30:45,917 --> 00:30:56,986
And so in a nutshell, what they do is they do they find the remains of humans through some spatial sampling of remains.

270
00:30:56,987 --> 00:31:02,717
Do genomic sequencing reconstruct the satellite cities of how are they related genomically

271
00:31:03,197 --> 00:31:08,747
and then they kind of infer the migration patterns also kind of thinking about the geography,

272
00:31:08,747 --> 00:31:11,626
obviously, in which ways that could have migrated.

273
00:31:11,627 --> 00:31:19,097
So there's kind of this puzzle where you try to infer what happened just based on a few pieces of evidence that you find.

274
00:31:19,097 --> 00:31:25,277
And we so we are finding this basically here in the world of tumors as well.

275
00:31:25,397 --> 00:31:32,267
We did this before in colon colorectal cancer in more detail where, you know, on the left here,

276
00:31:32,267 --> 00:31:38,267
you see, you know, the individual regions be we sample tumors from sequencing,

277
00:31:38,537 --> 00:31:43,577
we found genetic trees and then on the very right and kind of understand which

278
00:31:43,577 --> 00:31:49,007
clones invaded first and what is what is the history of invasion in these tumors?

279
00:31:49,877 --> 00:31:52,937
But now we're not waiting for cancer for this project.

280
00:31:52,937 --> 00:31:59,386
We're working in this area. And I'm going to tell you a little bit about this specific study we did to try to infer these dynamics.

281
00:31:59,387 --> 00:32:05,887
So starting on the left, we had 18 ex tumors from women diagnosis being detected.

282
00:32:05,887 --> 00:32:09,527
TKIs So the surgeon removes that the whole tumor.

283
00:32:09,767 --> 00:32:14,267
And then what we do is we cut to two five microscope sites.

284
00:32:14,747 --> 00:32:20,567
So these microscopic tumors have different locations, so they're sometimes several centimeters apart.

285
00:32:21,737 --> 00:32:27,646
And then when you when you look at these microscope slides, because as you remember, they're depressed as a startled tree.

286
00:32:27,647 --> 00:32:29,477
Right. Antiques grows in this country.

287
00:32:29,487 --> 00:32:37,817
So if you take these slides and you talk to the tumor, you will actually actually get these cross-sections of the animal to the duct.

288
00:32:38,417 --> 00:32:46,537
And that's where the weakest humor is. And so here in the third panel from the left, the micro dissected spots is where you see these little dots.

289
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:53,197
We went and micro dissected. To really study what's going on in these little spots.

290
00:32:53,207 --> 00:32:57,717
We genotyped them, tell you in a second how we we looked at the phenotype.

291
00:32:57,717 --> 00:33:07,787
They had seen pathologists annotated each of these 460 odd spots based on whether they were benign responses to cancer or invasive cancer.

292
00:33:08,597 --> 00:33:14,867
And because we had blocked maps from them, from the server, from the from mythology,

293
00:33:15,107 --> 00:33:19,407
we could actually get 3-D coordinates for each of those spots in space.

294
00:33:19,427 --> 00:33:27,656
So we basically reconstructed the maps of these tumors. Just that one one note about the genotyping if you're interested.

295
00:33:27,657 --> 00:33:32,337
So we first made a macro dissection, whole exome sequencing.

296
00:33:32,787 --> 00:33:40,137
And so looking at the entire genome related to mutation calling and DAS, and then we identified a panel of two Mississippi panels.

297
00:33:40,137 --> 00:33:47,097
So each will have its own panel of candidate mutations, because if you go to these little spots, you know,

298
00:33:47,097 --> 00:33:54,896
the technology and sequencing of these little spots, but you can if you know what you're looking for, you can do very targeted sequencing.

299
00:33:54,897 --> 00:34:03,026
And so we have, you know, somewhere below 100 mutations or a single nucleotide variant.

300
00:34:03,027 --> 00:34:10,097
So we're looking for a huge tumor. So we take out these the DNA in these little spots and then we do targeted sequencing of them.

301
00:34:10,107 --> 00:34:16,817
So when you read out eventually, once you call the mutations, it's these kind of panels where the columns is the spots, right?

302
00:34:16,897 --> 00:34:22,437
And each of them, we know where it lives and what its phenotype is and the rose art of mutations.

303
00:34:22,437 --> 00:34:25,467
And then we can see which mutation was present in which star.

304
00:34:26,547 --> 00:34:40,437
So that would be kind of the analog to the spatial genome sampling of human history and putting it all together here in this surface plot.

305
00:34:40,587 --> 00:34:43,226
I'm just going to walk you through it briefly coming from the outside in.

306
00:34:43,227 --> 00:34:48,507
So at the very periphery you have these panels of the mutations for each tumor.

307
00:34:49,167 --> 00:34:55,827
The second line from the outside is the histology, so normal breast cancer and breast tissue, etc. So invasive cancer.

308
00:34:56,517 --> 00:35:03,146
We also did some functional testing of driver mutations and there were very few in there.

309
00:35:03,147 --> 00:35:09,357
Interestingly, and we have tumor types, so some are pure because some have adjacent invasive cancer.

310
00:35:09,717 --> 00:35:14,126
And we were, of course, interested to to look at differences between the two.

311
00:35:14,127 --> 00:35:20,696
But I'm not going to get back to this this issue of politics versus synchronous configuration,

312
00:35:20,697 --> 00:35:26,577
because we basically couldn't find any features by which shows were distinguishing themselves.

313
00:35:26,577 --> 00:35:28,647
So they looked very, very similar.

314
00:35:30,117 --> 00:35:37,767
And once you have these mutations and that's really important as you can reconstruct this three dimensional somatic mutation topographies.

315
00:35:38,877 --> 00:35:44,157
So each tumor has these maps of each of its mutations, how they are dispersed in space.

316
00:35:44,397 --> 00:35:48,927
And I'm going to you know, I'm going to I'm going to take some links here in the following slides.

317
00:35:49,287 --> 00:35:55,616
And I hope you you can just follow with me and trust me, and I'm happy to give you more detail after.

318
00:35:55,617 --> 00:35:58,407
But this in itself is a it's a one hour talk.

319
00:35:58,407 --> 00:36:04,316
So I'm going to just kind of break it down into two main observations and then kind of take it from there.

320
00:36:04,317 --> 00:36:08,126
So the first observation is the disease is multiple.

321
00:36:08,127 --> 00:36:18,687
What do I mean by that? It means if you look into individual sections, there's multiple genetic subpopulations that makes them better.

322
00:36:19,467 --> 00:36:28,167
Okay. Nicely illustrated. If you look at these like variants of the frequency spectra, if you're familiar with this type of stuff,

323
00:36:28,437 --> 00:36:34,196
if you look at, say, the here, I'm showing you the separated plots where I look at both the and support our range.

324
00:36:34,197 --> 00:36:38,187
So within that dot, what is the kind of what does the spectrum look like?

325
00:36:38,187 --> 00:36:46,286
And they're quite dispersed that I support our range and the median are mostly white below 50, which is what you would expect.

326
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:51,567
This is a global population. So given good incidence that these are really kind of subclinical admixtures.

327
00:36:52,017 --> 00:37:00,386
So we're not going to dwell on this. But just keep in mind, multi-color, second observation is, you know,

328
00:37:00,387 --> 00:37:04,227
ideally you'd like to look at the samples themselves and how they spread through space.

329
00:37:04,617 --> 00:37:10,526
But the problem is if you have a really limited panel, you can do this what we call a sample deconvolution.

330
00:37:10,527 --> 00:37:20,667
So the inference of these data, the deconvolution of these clonal mixtures is only possible if you if you have much more data, a much more low set.

331
00:37:20,667 --> 00:37:26,156
So we couldn't do that, but we still have the actual mutations that we can track in space.

332
00:37:26,157 --> 00:37:28,677
And that's really the currency that we work with.

333
00:37:28,977 --> 00:37:35,216
Now, looking at these individual mutations, we found a lot of patterns that are illustrated by this figure here,

334
00:37:35,217 --> 00:37:39,327
where in blue the mutation is not present, yellow it is present.

335
00:37:39,687 --> 00:37:44,516
And when you look at the spatial map, you basically in every single B slice,

336
00:37:44,517 --> 00:37:48,386
the mutation is present in some spots, not in others, some spots not in other.

337
00:37:48,387 --> 00:37:53,247
So it's kind of like a scattering of mutations. And that was very systematic.

338
00:37:53,247 --> 00:37:55,617
And throughout these 18 tumors, that's what we encountered.

339
00:37:56,017 --> 00:38:02,426
And there were very few and mutation patterns that very nicely kind of cluster in space where you just have mutations here,

340
00:38:02,427 --> 00:38:09,747
but it's usually scattered throughout. And to put it in a different way here, if you look, this is one example.

341
00:38:10,017 --> 00:38:13,887
We we spatially cluster just one dimensional clustering of the ducts.

342
00:38:14,397 --> 00:38:20,807
So if you look at a single mutation and kind of wander through space, you kind of go from on off or on off.

343
00:38:20,817 --> 00:38:26,517
So it's kind of like scattered throughout, right? It's not spatially segregated much.

344
00:38:27,867 --> 00:38:31,467
And we found these kind of skin lesions. So some of the tumors we looked at were pretty big.

345
00:38:31,797 --> 00:38:35,187
We thought of macroscopic scales of seven centimeters.

346
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:40,106
So you have these mutations that are reaching both ends, but they are scattered throughout.

347
00:38:40,107 --> 00:38:44,367
So they're not just like a common mutation that arose in the very first cell and just spread out.

348
00:38:44,727 --> 00:38:49,317
The things that came up later and still ended up totally scattered over several centimeters.

349
00:38:49,317 --> 00:38:54,716
So quite a fascinating fox. And we wanted to make make sense of this, of course.

350
00:38:54,717 --> 00:39:00,786
So. Here is a leap of faith for you in the interest of time, I'm just going to be diplomatic.

351
00:39:00,787 --> 00:39:05,557
So we figured out that mutations arose earlier that were not like events.

352
00:39:05,557 --> 00:39:07,717
So things happened very early on. The evolution.

353
00:39:08,827 --> 00:39:13,367
So what happens in the very beginning here in this Mueller plot that I'm showing is like you've opened a first?

354
00:39:13,387 --> 00:39:19,697
Well, I mean, very soon you have this kind of activity of mutational bursts and these kind of circles.

355
00:39:20,347 --> 00:39:24,457
They just kind of start rolling out. Right. That's very early in the tumorigenesis.

356
00:39:24,727 --> 00:39:30,307
We are not yet kind of growing throughout the breast, but we're just just at the very beginning of this.

357
00:39:30,937 --> 00:39:37,607
Now, the question is, what happens afterwards? So things happen early, but not how does it actually spread through the breast.

358
00:39:37,627 --> 00:39:42,997
So again, remember that the breast epithelium tissue is a double tree.

359
00:39:43,627 --> 00:39:50,706
So these tumors draw on trees quite literally and not just like skeletal growth, like there have been other organs.

360
00:39:50,707 --> 00:39:53,737
So that that really changes the way you think about it a little bit.

361
00:39:53,977 --> 00:39:57,397
So really, we need to think about a smaller plot that looks more like this where you start

362
00:39:57,397 --> 00:40:02,647
having potentially physical branching as well as that these samples evolve.

363
00:40:03,607 --> 00:40:06,867
Now. What do you expect?

364
00:40:08,037 --> 00:40:12,417
Going back to the kind of realization that it's very similar to invasive cancer.

365
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:18,477
You can start asking yourself a lot of what are their what are the comments that we expect if this was really the case?

366
00:40:18,947 --> 00:40:23,877
And that's a fair starting point, because for all intents and purposes, they look very similar.

367
00:40:24,177 --> 00:40:28,466
So what do we expect if it really does grow similarly to invasive cancer?

368
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:37,227
So a positive clonal evolution model like, you know, like the way we think and model solid tumor growth.

369
00:40:37,527 --> 00:40:44,187
So we have uncontrolled cellular proliferation, we have competition for space and resources and we have the potential for selection

370
00:40:44,187 --> 00:40:47,277
where some phones are more fit than the other to not compete each other.

371
00:40:47,727 --> 00:40:52,167
So if you go through with this, you know, here we're at the level of a thought experiment.

372
00:40:52,437 --> 00:40:58,676
You expect something like this. Why? It's because he's tumors basically grow and be long tubes.

373
00:40:58,677 --> 00:41:08,167
And if you have these competition processes happening in really thin tubes very quickly, one plant will just win all of the other state.

374
00:41:09,677 --> 00:41:16,366
Okay. But that's not at all what we observe. Right. Because going back to our two observations, we found these these dots are multiple levels.

375
00:41:16,367 --> 00:41:21,297
So if you cut through it, you find multiple admixtures. And also the indications are quite dispersed.

376
00:41:21,297 --> 00:41:25,997
That might be in some guts, but it might not. So the pictures really don't add up here.

377
00:41:26,627 --> 00:41:30,357
And, you know, we were very confused for for a while.

378
00:41:30,397 --> 00:41:33,647
I really tried to figure out what is going on.

379
00:41:34,787 --> 00:41:38,957
And that's, you know, that's that's that's a good moment to kind of zoom out, right?

380
00:41:38,987 --> 00:41:42,047
You're confused. You're really in the weeds. So let's zoom out.

381
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:46,517
Let's zoom out. What, what what is the Brexit? Right? What is this or how does it start?

382
00:41:46,577 --> 00:41:51,737
At the very beginning, because I've heard that there is no real directory.

383
00:41:52,037 --> 00:41:58,877
It's just this kind of a routine that there is only during puberty that a lot of growth happens and

384
00:41:58,877 --> 00:42:05,477
this tiny little root amount of the tree will grow into this very expansive binary branching structure.

385
00:42:06,397 --> 00:42:11,827
Okay. And, you know, if you think of this continuing to hear from, you know, for perpetuity,

386
00:42:12,007 --> 00:42:17,047
the deceased, which grows on the trees and then invasion folks really,

387
00:42:17,137 --> 00:42:22,497
you know, concentrate on vicious invasion is kind of things like things that are really close together.

388
00:42:22,497 --> 00:42:29,767
Right. What if you look to the left of that where we'll be look at what if you look at the processes that take place during normal development.

389
00:42:30,727 --> 00:42:41,587
In other words, what do we know about the dynamics of this memory development during the period that there's been really nice work by folks

390
00:42:41,587 --> 00:42:49,297
in the Netherlands who looked at this in urine models and the process of branching morphogenesis where a tree grows.

391
00:42:50,617 --> 00:42:55,357
Very interestingly and interestingly has a very similar skip patterns of mutations.

392
00:42:55,707 --> 00:43:00,067
Okay. Yeah, if I can just. We're behind.

393
00:43:02,647 --> 00:43:08,627
Yeah. But I need to shave off 10 minutes of my chocolate.

394
00:43:09,897 --> 00:43:18,306
That's feasible. So in a nutshell, we find very similar patterns in normal development right now.

395
00:43:18,307 --> 00:43:21,517
You know, where does this go? It's like, oh, okay, okay.

396
00:43:21,517 --> 00:43:26,077
That what we think is normal kind of invasive cancer growth doesn't fit the data at all.

397
00:43:27,097 --> 00:43:34,416
You know, we find very similar patterns. So can we try to see what happens with getting X if the growth models,

398
00:43:34,417 --> 00:43:39,777
we're kind of actually imitating mimicking the normal developmental programing

399
00:43:39,907 --> 00:43:45,087
rather than this kind of completely degenerate clonal evolution of these cancers.

400
00:43:46,357 --> 00:43:50,497
The nice thing is, you know, these folks also did a lot of quantitative, really neat paper, actually.

401
00:43:50,497 --> 00:43:52,067
I recommend reading it,

402
00:43:52,497 --> 00:44:01,927
did a lot of quantitative modeling model fitting and identified very simple stochastic rules for how this process most likely takes place.

403
00:44:02,257 --> 00:44:09,637
So long story short, we kind of build on their work now these dynamics and adapted to the DCS setting.

404
00:44:09,877 --> 00:44:20,077
So we build these ductal trees, we initiate these tumors, and we let them grow according to into dynamics reminiscent of a developmental program.

405
00:44:20,527 --> 00:44:23,707
And we call this a comment model, but I can't tell you the reason that existed.

406
00:44:25,477 --> 00:44:30,697
But what I want to show you is just compare to the observer type of patterns that we see in the data.

407
00:44:31,057 --> 00:44:32,307
We're getting much closer now.

408
00:44:32,317 --> 00:44:40,807
We have these kind of dispersed patterns because, not surprisingly, because we actually use a model that gives the same outputs in the normal breast.

409
00:44:41,407 --> 00:44:44,407
But the clonal evolution, once, if similar, does that.

410
00:44:44,407 --> 00:44:51,277
If again, not surprisingly, these very different patterns here, we've made all of this much more formal.

411
00:44:51,607 --> 00:45:02,587
So we took the actual mutation, very similar data and combined them like 50 stochastic models to our data with approximate Bayesian computation.

412
00:45:03,067 --> 00:45:06,437
And basically, you know, the nutshell of this,

413
00:45:06,437 --> 00:45:14,586
this here is it's a good fit to data and it actually fits much better based factor of more intense than the global average.

414
00:45:14,587 --> 00:45:22,197
And so giving us some good kind of quantitative evidence that this is a much more likely mechanism.

415
00:45:22,247 --> 00:45:27,937
Yes. So summing up here, you know, these details recapitulates little breast development.

416
00:45:27,937 --> 00:45:31,807
That's what our data seems to suggest with some strength.

417
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:40,027
And I think it's really fascinating because it gives you a mechanistic explanation for why DCS have a very limited progression potential.

418
00:45:40,177 --> 00:45:46,977
Despite their shared similarity like genomic and proteomic similarity.

419
00:45:47,027 --> 00:45:53,407
Basic cancer provides a biologic rationale for ongoing efforts to reduce overtreatment as well.

420
00:45:54,307 --> 00:45:59,407
Now I'm going to the how to reduce now sadly has to kind of go away.

421
00:46:00,157 --> 00:46:10,177
We work in active monitoring. I'm involved with a trial run by Dr. Wong Randomizing patients to two active monitoring to try to de-escalate treatment.

422
00:46:10,567 --> 00:46:16,177
We develop decision aids for patients to try to going to help them navigate these uncertain decisions.

423
00:46:16,597 --> 00:46:20,166
And just maybe this one here, I'm very excited.

424
00:46:20,167 --> 00:46:28,626
We just got another one together with my colleague Lars Graham is a radiologist where we're going to kind of take serial mammograms

425
00:46:28,627 --> 00:46:34,687
and multiracial tissue assays and try to develop dynamic imaging markers because a lot of these in a lot of these tests,

426
00:46:34,687 --> 00:46:44,147
they actually are calcified. So if you can start watching them on mammogram during monitoring and use the images, you know,

427
00:46:44,247 --> 00:46:54,207
as as a as a as a marker over time to predict progression risk that that's something we're really fascinated by and yeah so because that's.

428
00:47:00,387 --> 00:47:05,217
Sorry. We ran a little. Yeah, no, he started a little bit late, especially for Mark.

429
00:47:08,007 --> 00:47:17,697
I'll ask the question. How is the reception in the clinical community of this very persuasive model based on computational evidence?

430
00:47:17,937 --> 00:47:25,557
Are you getting pushed? I know it's just models or are people persuaded that this is the way to think about things?

431
00:47:27,777 --> 00:47:32,447
I can't tell you because we only just it's under review, but it's not already out there.

432
00:47:32,457 --> 00:47:38,307
So I tend to surround myself with people who get that benefit.

433
00:47:39,177 --> 00:47:43,097
But, you know, of course, that will be put back out. So this is, I think.

434
00:47:44,317 --> 00:47:52,217
But one thing is more. Thanks everyone for joining in person and answering.
