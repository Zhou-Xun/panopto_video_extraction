1
00:00:03,136 --> 00:00:11,136
Okay, so it's two minutes past 12. If any of the people come in they can just trickle and we'll go ahead and get started.

2
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:20,136
So I want to thank you all for showing up for the Google sweet teaching using Google collaboration tools.

3
00:00:20,136 --> 00:00:28,136
My name is Monica Rosen I'm one of the instructional designers for the School of Public Health, and I have with me one of my colleagues here, Marija,

4
00:00:28,136 --> 00:00:30,136
do you want to go ahead and introduce yourself.

5
00:00:30,136 --> 00:00:42,136
Hi everyone, my name is Marija, and I just started working as an instructional designer we're excited about this workshop and joining Monica on this.

6
00:00:42,136 --> 00:00:50,136
So just to lay some of the foundation of how to interact with this workshop.

7
00:00:50,136 --> 00:00:56,136
There are live transcripts that are being that are available, you just need to click the button to enable them.

8
00:00:56,136 --> 00:01:06,136
And if you have any questions throughout this workshop, feel free to throw those chat those in the chat box. One of us will try and get through those, but this is a pretty small group so.

9
00:01:06,136 --> 00:01:22,136
Also feel free to unmute yourself and just ask this your question, I think that should be pretty simple. I will ask if you could refrain from using the hand raising tool in zoom, just because I may not be able to see that showing up with the issues

10
00:01:22,136 --> 00:01:27,136
the windows of the people, and that might get missed.

11
00:01:27,136 --> 00:01:29,136
So start this.

12
00:01:29,136 --> 00:01:42,136
This lunch and learn in what better way to start then telling you guys some of our learning objectives we are instructional designers after all. So by the end of this workshop we are hoping that you'll be able to identify a variety of the Google suite

13
00:01:42,136 --> 00:01:58,136
tools in your toolbox that are available to you that fosters student engagement and collaboration. We also hope that you'll be able to assess the utility of these various Google tools, as it relates to your courses learning objectives and or competencies.

14
00:01:58,136 --> 00:02:16,136
And then lastly, be able to outline the primary function of these different Google tools and be able to list a handful of ways in which the tools, could be used to support both remote online in person hybrid however you like it kinds of courses and teaching.

15
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:24,136
So we have a little bit of an agenda that will kind of we're going to try and Mark, we did start a smidge late but I'm sure we can make up for that time.

16
00:02:24,136 --> 00:02:38,136
And we're first going to talk a little bit about alignment and collaborative learning so we'll define what collaborative learning is and what it means to align a tools functionality with your courses learning objective so you get the best tool to achieve

17
00:02:38,136 --> 00:02:53,136
that. Then I'll spend a little bit of time talking about Google suite in general, why it's different from your hard drive, types of processor what makes it different from using Word and document, and then why we're pushing kind of for more people to use

18
00:02:53,136 --> 00:03:05,136
this especially in the collaborative manner. And then we'll spend some time talking about Google Slides which is the equivalent to kind of Microsoft PowerPoint, but a little bit different so we'll play around with that we'll have a little breakout activity

19
00:03:05,136 --> 00:03:21,136
to kind of get your feet wet with how to use that tool in new and creative ways, then we'll move into Google Docs and jam board docs is similar to Word doc, with a few differences in there, and then jam board maybe one day you're not too familiar with.

20
00:03:21,136 --> 00:03:34,136
But it's a fun one as well and we have an activity plan for that as well. And then lastly we'll end with talking about Google Sheets and forms, Google Sheets and forms have been using a lot of different like business settings and with colleague and project

21
00:03:34,136 --> 00:03:46,136
working, but we don't see too often in teach in cleat in teaching in the classroom, but there is a lot of opportunity for being able to use it as well so I'll demo a couple of examples that we have for how you can use Google Sheets.

22
00:03:46,136 --> 00:03:55,136
Lastly, we'll have a small set time for some q amp a and talk about some of our other upcoming workshops.

23
00:03:55,136 --> 00:04:07,136
So, how can Google suite be used to foster engagement and collaboration. Well, it's quite simple, it's actually only two steps, it's always nice whenever you have just two things that you need to do.

24
00:04:07,136 --> 00:04:21,136
Well, step one is to identify your courses covering MCs and or learning objectives. And the question that you'll want to have when you're thinking about this is, what is it that the students should be able to do so that verb that action that Satan in

25
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:31,136
your competency or learning objective, with the content by the end of your course or module one really good way of being but assesses is to use Bloom's taxonomy.

26
00:04:31,136 --> 00:04:43,136
We will provide these slides at the end will email them out to everybody who signed up, and there is a little bit of a link in here that you can if you're not as familiar with blooms and you can check that out.

27
00:04:43,136 --> 00:04:52,136
blooms is actually a well established pedagogical approach to establishing observable measurable learning objectives and it can help you with deciding what kinds of tools work best with your course.

28
00:04:52,136 --> 00:05:04,136
So then once you have your course competencies and learning objectives in the four thought of your mind, then you can assess what tools you need in order to support the student achievement of that learning objective.

29
00:05:04,136 --> 00:05:20,136
So for instance, one example I'm thinking about is, see if competency number three. that competency asked students to be able to analyze quantitative and qualitative data using biostatistics informatics computer based programming and software as appropriate.

30
00:05:20,136 --> 00:05:36,136
So with that keyword being analyzed, you want to make sure that you're using a tool that allows students to engage in analytical actions. So for instance, you know SPSS SAS statistical software, in our case in the Google sweet toolbox, it may be the Excel

31
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:43,136
sheet equivalent Google Sheets, and I'll give you kind of an example of what that looks like.

32
00:05:43,136 --> 00:05:55,136
One thing that I will note that's very important, is it's not really suitable to just try and use a tool just for the sake of using it. So just trying to wedge a tool and because you think it's the latest and the greatest but doesn't quite match up with

33
00:05:55,136 --> 00:06:02,136
what your course is goals are, it can sometimes be a flop and some students will notice that mismatch.

34
00:06:02,136 --> 00:06:12,136
So do be sure that when you're deciding on what tool to use that is directly aligned with those competencies and learning objectives.

35
00:06:12,136 --> 00:06:18,136
And with that, I'll go ahead and pass it off to media who will talk a little bit about alignment and collaborative learning.

36
00:06:18,136 --> 00:06:25,136
Thanks, Monica. So, as Monica was saying, when we're designing a course and planning for our lesson.

37
00:06:25,136 --> 00:06:38,136
We want to start first thinking about competencies and learning objectives or if we want to think about it as proficiency. So what that student is going to be able to do at the end of this lesson or this course.

38
00:06:38,136 --> 00:06:56,136
So if we're looking at a different seat competency maybe focused on collaboration, teamwork, then we're looking at how can students demonstrate that they are engaging and teamwork and effective teamwork and one pedagogy that we can apply to that is Collaborative

39
00:06:56,136 --> 00:07:12,136
learning social learning, constructing learning together. And when we're thinking about pedagogy then we also can think about what are available tools, what can we use that will support that kind of learning those kinds of competencies.

40
00:07:12,136 --> 00:07:28,136
A lot of times when we design courses we might think about what's the content to cover, you know, and what's what's an assignment and then lastly we might think of assessments, and this backwards design something that instructional designers, talk about

41
00:07:28,136 --> 00:07:42,136
us is thinking about the competencies first, then, what's this exam going to be at the, at the end, then what the practice activities are. And then what is the content to cover.

42
00:07:42,136 --> 00:08:01,136
So in our case, we're thinking about collaborative learning, and G sweet is a perfect place for that because it has a variety of tools for different types of disciplines different types of assignments that are that are unique to that experience.

43
00:08:01,136 --> 00:08:20,136
So here's a couple things to keep in mind when you're using a collaborative tool, creating that learning community. I'm thinking about growth mindset and encouraging people to participate to interact, but to do so, we want to also think about not just

44
00:08:20,136 --> 00:08:36,136
how to use the tool, but also how do we model, the use of a tool. So if we're asking students to use the Google Slides for example, and showing them how we to interact with them, how we can do an example within the slides.

45
00:08:36,136 --> 00:08:53,136
So this modeling and collaborating within the tool also give us an opportunity to see how they are collaborating and to if if there's an opportunity, have like an intervention or show them what to think of further.

46
00:08:53,136 --> 00:09:11,136
So what I'm suggesting sometimes with these group projects or teamwork is to build in for teams milestones or check ins where the instructor GIFs feedback and in such a way, models that collaboration that will be happening in the class and hopefully that

47
00:09:11,136 --> 00:09:22,136
will be that level playing field where towards the end, they will feel like, Ah, this is a learning community, we can take this further after this class.

48
00:09:22,136 --> 00:09:33,136
So again, maybe scaffolding within that tool and showing students how to scaffold knowledge. And then when it's a tool that's being used for example, can board.

49
00:09:33,136 --> 00:09:42,136
We got to make sure that we're not all erasing each other's work, or that when we're creating something on that space that we're kind of mindful of other people's areas.

50
00:09:42,136 --> 00:09:57,136
And then, the biggest reason maybe to think about real world teamwork, because once we get out of here it's not going to be this group work but that sometimes when we do report somebody takes the environmental scan somebody takes the final summary.

51
00:09:57,136 --> 00:10:09,136
And then each person ends up working individually so how do we do collaborative work where everyone's contributing equally and we're modeling it. And within that sphere.

52
00:10:09,136 --> 00:10:18,136
It's more collaborative, it's more conducive to everybody seeing each other's contribution.

53
00:10:18,136 --> 00:10:20,136
Okay, Monica.

54
00:10:20,136 --> 00:10:29,136
So Google suite and your license with the University of Michigan has access to almost 40 different Google tools. I will not be going over all 40 of them.

55
00:10:29,136 --> 00:10:44,136
I'm going to be kind of talking about the ones that I think are most useful for teaching, which is a handful of them. This includes the drive and what the drive is, it's a cloud based shareable folder file management system.

56
00:10:44,136 --> 00:10:55,136
I'll go into it a little bit more in a bit. We're also going to talk about slides as I mentioned that is an equivalent to Microsoft PowerPoint, again a cloud based shareable and collaborative slide creator.

57
00:10:55,136 --> 00:10:57,136
We're going to talk about docs.

58
00:10:57,136 --> 00:11:09,136
It's a cloud based shareable and collaborative doc processor and as you can kind of get this as they're all very cloud based and shareable and collaborative in nature, a jam board is a virtual whiteboard.

59
00:11:09,136 --> 00:11:22,136
That one bit maybe not as familiar with but that's a fun one as well. And then also, the spreadsheet processor sheets and also forms with which is kind of like a questionnaire system that can be used and actually some creative, other interesting ways

60
00:11:22,136 --> 00:11:26,136
that all kind of highlight as well.

61
00:11:26,136 --> 00:11:40,136
So, what are the Google suite tools, one of the perks to using Google's free tools and why should you shift over to using Google suite tools when your tried and true Microsoft processor has always been nice and works well perfectly for you.

62
00:11:40,136 --> 00:11:51,136
Well the Google suite tools actually can make your life a lot easier. It is a living, working cloud based tool. So you it's a one place that you need to update instead of.

63
00:11:51,136 --> 00:12:04,136
I'm sure many of you have had this scenario where you've created a syllabus and then maybe a week into the course things started to change a little bit so you had to take it down and re upload it and you append version two and then maybe three weeks later,

64
00:12:04,136 --> 00:12:13,136
there's a snowstorm courses gets canceled, things have to change with the schedule, you have to unload it upload another one version three so on, so on, so on.

65
00:12:13,136 --> 00:12:28,136
In this case, if you just attach the link in your Coursera site and your Canvas site in your announcements every email you only have to update that one document live and all the time without having to have many different iterations of the same document.

66
00:12:28,136 --> 00:12:43,136
Google's we be tools because of its nature of being in the cloud and being collaborative, it supports both asynchronous and synchronous collaboration, so you can use these tools in person in your actual class live, or you can have them virtual or, in

67
00:12:43,136 --> 00:12:54,136
many cases, as we've noticed with Copa remote learning we might have a mix of students and so how do we get those mix of students to be working on the same types of projects in real time.

68
00:12:54,136 --> 00:13:09,136
And so these kinds of tools, facilitate that. It's not, you can use Google Street tools as an alternative to participation grade, many times participation grade is attached to whether the student has you know but in see in class, but we can also with

69
00:13:09,136 --> 00:13:15,136
a lot of the working professionals if you teach for instance in the online program you'll notice sometimes the students can't make it to those live sessions.

70
00:13:15,136 --> 00:13:27,136
And if you attach a participation grade to, and working on a collaborative google doc or a slide deck and then there may be an alternative way to assess participation.

71
00:13:27,136 --> 00:13:32,136
Another great thing about the Google Tools is it integrates across a lot of different other tools.

72
00:13:32,136 --> 00:13:42,136
Obviously, as I mentioned, there's about 40 tools in Google Google's toolbox and so they all play really nicely with each other and they play nicely with a couple of others as well.

73
00:13:42,136 --> 00:13:51,136
And, for instance, one of those ways that it plays nicely is it can convert to and from all the other major processors. This includes Microsoft products, and includes Apple products.

74
00:13:51,136 --> 00:14:01,136
If you've been around for a little while, you probably remember the open documents I think those things are still around, but sometimes I see that it can also work with open as well.

75
00:14:01,136 --> 00:14:13,136
And one of the big biggest perks, is that this is a university supported tool, we actually with our email addresses being situated in Google, we have unlimited storage.

76
00:14:13,136 --> 00:14:24,136
So if you have a private gmail account and you have a drive you'll notice that there's so there's a capping off of that. But with you with them, we have all supported with full with unlimited storage.

77
00:14:24,136 --> 00:14:39,136
This also means because it's within the university, that if we want to collaborate with our colleagues or with our students anybody who has also at UMUU Mish email address, can be mentioned and commented and worked on in the, in the same document.

78
00:14:39,136 --> 00:14:55,136
If you are interested to learn more about the Google tools, and what it means, as it attached to the University of Michigan I have this link in here. It's through it so you can learn a little bit more on that side as well.

79
00:14:55,136 --> 00:15:05,136
So, what is google drive google drive sounds very similar and works very similar to any other type of cloud drive processor. It's basically your hard drive in the cloud.

80
00:15:05,136 --> 00:15:16,136
So instead of stuff being stagnant and attached only to your desktop computer, you can access your files and your folders on any other computer as long as you can log into your email address.

81
00:15:16,136 --> 00:15:29,136
This then allows you to have private and shared folders and files so you can you can organize all of your documents within folders and those folders can be private to you, so they're your own workings.us.

82
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:42,136
You can also have, for instance, a folder devoted to your course. And you can actually share that entire course folder with your students so they have access to all of your materials and can actually interact and engage with all the course materials.

83
00:15:42,136 --> 00:15:53,136
You can also then make a permanent shareable link. So if you think about the drive as the, the highlight of it is being that you have this working link that you can attach to everything.

84
00:15:53,136 --> 00:16:02,136
Then there's also different ways on how you can share those links. So I'm going to kind of demonstrate this right now with this actual slide deck that I'm using.

85
00:16:02,136 --> 00:16:12,136
So if I want to share this link out and I only want the students to be able to view it without actually changing anything, I would go on to the share button.

86
00:16:12,136 --> 00:16:15,136
And then I would ask for it to get the link.

87
00:16:15,136 --> 00:16:28,136
So share with University of Michigan I can change that if I wanted to make it more broadly available. And then as you can see there's a drop down menu it's not very obvious but I could buy clicks that I can choose, do I want when I share this link out

88
00:16:28,136 --> 00:16:40,136
do I want to give them viewing privileges commenting privileges or full editing privileges, commenting is as it sounds, they can view it and they can leave a comment on it but they can't actually change the structure of anything that's in there.

89
00:16:40,136 --> 00:16:47,136
This can be very useful depending on what kinds of activities and assignments you want to share with the students.

90
00:16:47,136 --> 00:17:03,136
And then you can also open this up as I mentioned, if you want to be further out, besides outside of university Michigan you can actually make this anyone with the link can get it, just in case anybody doesn't have an email.

91
00:17:03,136 --> 00:17:15,136
So with that being said and kind of getting the foundations of what the drive and the folders and files all, how they work, I actually want to kind of talk a little bit now about the Google side so that's what I'm actually presenting all of my this presentation

92
00:17:15,136 --> 00:17:17,136
on his with Google Slides.

93
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:31,136
It is a collaborative cloud based slide career leader and presenter, and it features all those same great features as I mentioned before about why Google suite is great and where the DR works really well and invite students to actually participate in

94
00:17:31,136 --> 00:17:43,136
your lecture slides with built in activities. So in the past, we've had for instance PowerPoint slides and it was kind of like we created these slides and we present them to the students, and maybe there's some questions in there and they're writing down

95
00:17:43,136 --> 00:17:57,136
on the papers to fill out some questions. But this kind of allows students that if you share an editing ability, with the students, then you can actually have your activity right on the slide deck and they could all be contributing.

96
00:17:57,136 --> 00:18:08,136
At the same time, so I want to give you guys an example of this, Sharon kar diya actually uses this in her Ph by 15 course, and she has kindly allowed me to share this demonstration with you guys.

97
00:18:08,136 --> 00:18:22,136
This is her week one zoom session for the winter 2021 course, all student identification information has been erased from it so hope, hopefully none of that got left in there I think I took it all out there, but as you can, as we kind of scroll through

98
00:18:22,136 --> 00:18:34,136
we can see that she has her normal kinds of slides setup you know what are the expectations the agenda, some housekeeping roles and questions and then she kind of jumps directly into some of her materials.

99
00:18:34,136 --> 00:18:47,136
And then what she ends up happening is a little bit of a demo that's built right into this slide deck here she asked, let's start with some simple 10 minute exercise for type two diabetes, what are we trying to prevent in who what percent of us adults

100
00:18:47,136 --> 00:18:59,136
so giving them out mindset of what they're going to be doing it the questions they're going to be asking, and then she has her activities built directly into these different slides, and she assigns each everybody to a particular group with a breakout

101
00:18:59,136 --> 00:19:10,136
room, and she gives this link to the students in the, in the chat function and then everybody at the same time can actually be entering their data in here in lifetime.

102
00:19:10,136 --> 00:19:23,136
I think she has a couple of other types of activities done in there. Here's another one, it comes back to the group one a little bit of a sample for her for the students to engage with.

103
00:19:23,136 --> 00:19:29,136
And then I also want to show you guys another example of how slides have been used in a really creative way.

104
00:19:29,136 --> 00:19:34,136
This is for an online EHS course.

105
00:19:34,136 --> 00:19:48,136
This is actually a week, Lee reflections slide deck so one of the this professor had some concerns with the students were coming to cool, or to the class prepared having read the articles before the course.

106
00:19:48,136 --> 00:19:57,136
So we try to think of some creative ways in which we could actually motivate the students to read the articles before showing up for class so what we ended up doing is we have some directions in here.

107
00:19:57,136 --> 00:20:10,136
There's one slide deck for every week of the course. This course is a very condensed course with only four more weeks, and it tells me exactly what they're expected to do on there, it says on slide two you're going to reflect on how you engage with each

108
00:20:10,136 --> 00:20:21,136
of this week's article readings so here's like to. And because this is a pretty small course as a seminar style class, you might have to think a little bit creatively if you were having a large for so you could probably do this in groups as well, she

109
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:32,136
she actually has each of the students names appear on the top, and they actually just kind of give it a qualitative rating as to how they feel about those.

110
00:20:32,136 --> 00:20:39,136
This is copy and paste these dots they can grab one copy, paste and then move it around to how they felt about that article how they resonated with the article.

111
00:20:39,136 --> 00:20:51,136
This is not only great for the instructor, as they have an idea as to whether these readings are being fully implemented and enlightened how they're being consumed by the students but it's also great for the students as well, to kind of get an idea as

112
00:20:51,136 --> 00:20:54,136
to whether everybody's feeling the same way about it.

113
00:20:54,136 --> 00:21:08,136
There's also some notes in here about the directions, about what to do. And then she has. After this, students each have one slide that they're supposed to create and they're supposed to do any kind of multimedia type of reflection about the reading so

114
00:21:08,136 --> 00:21:22,136
this is just supposed to get their minds, thinking about how can I come to the zoom session and talk about the readings that I just read. It's supposed to be a little bit less of a heavily writing component and more of a visual one.

115
00:21:22,136 --> 00:21:37,136
And so far, she's only in week to but she says that she has loved us so much that the students seem completely much more prepared for it with the readings and conversation starters, then the semester before.

116
00:21:37,136 --> 00:21:51,136
So, and the last thing I want to say about Google Slides is that there's another way you can interact and this was happening with PowerPoint as well, is that there's a Poll Everywhere integration, we do have the full light, light license for university

117
00:21:51,136 --> 00:21:57,136
of Michigan School public health faculty to use Poll Everywhere. So if you are a user that likes to use Poll Everywhere.

118
00:21:57,136 --> 00:21:59,136
If you actually go.

119
00:21:59,136 --> 00:22:10,136
This is a link, I will make it blue real quick so you guys know that it's a clickable link, you can actually follow the directions for how to integrate Poll Everywhere directly into your Google sweet.

120
00:22:10,136 --> 00:22:20,136
So as you can see if you look up here I actually have this little add on full everywhere, and I can actually add a new activity directly into my slides as well.

121
00:22:20,136 --> 00:22:32,136
So, with all of that being said, we're going to kind of practice a little bit with some of this and modeling a little bit of what the, the online EHS course did.

122
00:22:32,136 --> 00:22:45,136
We're going to try to understand better understand what collaboration is through a collaborative project. The directions for this activity is ever going to send you guys out into breakout rooms to talk with your colleagues for five to 10 minutes, and

123
00:22:45,136 --> 00:22:56,136
about the concept of collaboration, we'd like you to populate your group slide with keywords and we'll see media similar to what you saw in the HEHSEHS course.

124
00:22:56,136 --> 00:23:07,136
And then one of the best ways to kind of do this is think about just going to Google Images, and then just kind of googling some synonyms for collaboration or what kinds of words jump out to you.

125
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:14,136
So I'm going to go ahead and put this link in the chat.

126
00:23:14,136 --> 00:23:38,319
So you have access to it. And then you'll notice that your, your group will actually be the breakout group activity that you're assigned to, and then I'll kind of jump around between the groups, just in case anybody else has any concerns.

127
00:23:38,983 --> 00:23:47,983
Welcome back everybody thanks for participating in our little demo. I hope that that was a little bit enlightening about some different ways that you can use Google Slides.

128
00:23:47,983 --> 00:23:57,983
So we're going to go ahead and move on and media is going to take over and talk to you guys a little bit about Google Docs.

129
00:23:57,983 --> 00:24:15,983
So a lot of you use Google Docs and research and collaboration with other faculty members and your research groups, and as Monica said, this is a great place to also involve the teams to work on Google Docs, but sometimes we need that extra nudge or to

130
00:24:15,983 --> 00:24:20,983
incorporate it into our Canvas site incorporated into the team activity.

131
00:24:20,983 --> 00:24:33,983
So as Monica said, you can have the syllabus real time updates but this can update in different Canvas sections or different years when you're moving from this fall to winter.

132
00:24:33,983 --> 00:24:48,983
So we're going to look at an interactive syllabus and as we were saying earlier in terms of modeling. This is a great place to ask students if they have questions for the syllabus to go on in and ask the questions and you can comment back.

133
00:24:48,983 --> 00:24:57,983
So, we're going to show you this.

134
00:24:57,983 --> 00:25:02,983
So Monica, if you don't mind commenting something, asking a question.

135
00:25:02,983 --> 00:25:13,983
So for instance, you could be having your syllabus in here and you maybe you only want to give them commenting privileges not necessarily messing with your syllabus, but maybe there's something in here like about the textbook and you're like you're unsure

136
00:25:13,983 --> 00:25:23,983
I can't seem to find this can have the students at comment, and they can actually directly comment to you so you'll get a little alert to your email saying that somebody's talking to you.

137
00:25:23,983 --> 00:25:35,983
I'll put it in for Marija, Marija sorry, be like, Hey, I'm not sure about where to find this reading.

138
00:25:35,983 --> 00:25:41,983
And I can assign it to her so when I assign it then she's going to get a notification that she got something.

139
00:25:41,983 --> 00:25:44,983
Then she can.

140
00:25:44,983 --> 00:25:57,983
And when she gets that email link she can immediately comment back to me. And if you leave that open for all the other students, we can kind of move away from the discussion board type of questions and have all the questions and the answers are being

141
00:25:57,983 --> 00:25:59,983
highlighted to everybody.

142
00:25:59,983 --> 00:26:08,983
You could then therefore change something in the syllabus to address the concern that the students have, or you can put a link to where you think that textbook is the best place to buy it.

143
00:26:08,983 --> 00:26:22,983
But either way, this kind of gives you a nice interactive way of making the syllabus, more engaging and welcoming of questions and concerns with the students.

144
00:26:22,983 --> 00:26:29,983
Okay, thanks Monica, we can go back to the slides.

145
00:26:29,983 --> 00:26:37,983
So as Michael said I would get that email and I can comment right right back and answer where that textbook is.

146
00:26:37,983 --> 00:26:51,983
And we can also utilize Google Docs, along with Canvas group tools and that's another workshop that we might go into. But for example if we want to build in these milestones or check ins with the teams.

147
00:26:51,983 --> 00:27:05,983
And in case we wanted to maybe have weekly check ins, they can in their Canvas groups have a discussion that's ongoing, and then within that discussion, they can have a link to their Google Doc.

148
00:27:05,983 --> 00:27:16,983
Now if we have this weekly check in, I can go in there as an instructor and provide feedback for that check in. So in that sense, I'm modeling the collaboration.

149
00:27:16,983 --> 00:27:30,983
I'm interacting with them and giving them feedback, okay you know this is a great article but maybe they look at something more recent or provide more details or something like that.

150
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:34,983
So, this can be used synchronously when you're using.

151
00:27:34,983 --> 00:27:51,983
Zoom breakout rooms so we put students that are working on the same team together, and they're working on that specific milestone, as you saw with slides, you're working on a little chunk of material, but with word we have this big Canvas we're writing

152
00:27:51,983 --> 00:28:04,983
a big piece we can be expected to do that and 15 minutes of group work time. But if we have these milestones. Okay, so today in our breakout rooms will be working on an outline.

153
00:28:04,983 --> 00:28:11,983
And this, not in a monitoring kind of way but it also gives you a visual of who contributed what.

154
00:28:11,983 --> 00:28:28,983
And that's kind of a link to the real world. When you're submitting a manuscript there are authorship guidelines. And within that however much you can tribute it to allows you to be, for example, an author on the article.

155
00:28:28,983 --> 00:28:47,983
So it's modeling that type of interaction, but it also gives you a chance to kind of see who's contributing What do we have an outlier here who's not really participating, how can we get them more involved.

156
00:28:47,983 --> 00:28:58,983
So here's some Google Doc examples and missed it. Great.

157
00:28:58,983 --> 00:29:10,983
Just any kind of collaborative writing piece essay literature review actually you can integrate Google Docs was no Taro, and there's help with the university.

158
00:29:10,983 --> 00:29:17,983
I think there are called spaces scholars spaces that they can help you how to do that.

159
00:29:17,983 --> 00:29:33,983
And there's a link here on how to integrate with Otero any kind of research paper practice based paper. Also modeling peer review or report. So in this group, we don't have, for example, I'm going to take environmental scan and the other person is going

160
00:29:33,983 --> 00:29:41,983
to take some other piece of it. We're all working on it together and we can see it all at one time.

161
00:29:41,983 --> 00:29:54,983
I'm going to transition here to jam board, you may or may have not heard about it. But the kind of functionality, it has is kind of similar to what you might be able to do in slides but it's all on one place.

162
00:29:54,983 --> 00:30:06,983
It's a collaborative cloud based multi page whiteboard. And here after the fact you can look at the chamber tutorial and it's super easy to use and we're actually going to go in there to do a little activity.

163
00:30:06,983 --> 00:30:14,983
So here's some features some of these we've already heard about but again this is one big scheme screen canvas to work on.

164
00:30:14,983 --> 00:30:27,983
Very similar to the whiteboard and zoom, but it has additional features. So again you can in this zoom like whiteboard, we can also do stylist.

165
00:30:27,983 --> 00:30:42,983
Annotations for either working through a math problem or using anatomy structures on these tools are very quick access versus going over to a toolbar and trying to open that up.

166
00:30:42,983 --> 00:30:47,983
You can save things as. jpg, and PDFs.

167
00:30:47,983 --> 00:31:01,983
And this time when you're saving it it's not going over here to some zoom Documents folder, but it's all in the Google Drive, and of course you have that version history and the record of collaboration.

168
00:31:01,983 --> 00:31:20,983
Very easy to create slides on the fly. And there's an ease of switching back from the zoom to the jam board screen. So, as we just did with slides will place it in the chat, and you will interact with the instructor going in there and placing stuff on

169
00:31:20,983 --> 00:31:22,983
the jam port.

170
00:31:22,983 --> 00:31:38,983
So it has a couple of unique tools like sticky notes. So, I'm, or an arrow, you have arrows and other places but it gives you a chance to mark up things, if you don't necessarily have that stylists.

171
00:31:38,983 --> 00:31:51,983
Also within jam board you can just within it, search for images, and you have that pointer, that you can use and it goes away as you're using it.

172
00:31:51,983 --> 00:31:56,983
So here's some Sham board examples of how you might use it.

173
00:31:56,983 --> 00:32:14,983
I'm just going to go through these super quickly. So concept mapping brainstorming, creating an evaluation where students have to fill in things, maybe a chart which is pros and cons or compare and contrast, which is what we're going to do a great big,

174
00:32:14,983 --> 00:32:33,983
large collaborative drawing where we can see how other people think and how they envision things. So in, In this example, maybe body systems how they interact with a drug or disease, or an illustration of how different systems interact in one big system

175
00:32:33,983 --> 00:32:35,983
within public health.

176
00:32:35,983 --> 00:32:51,983
Or we could be working on a collage of maybe nutrition images pictures of skin diseases, so we have that collage of all the different things that go into, You know, an illness or disease or something.

177
00:32:51,983 --> 00:33:06,983
Another way we can use it as graphing graph things we can interact on top of images. And, as, as we're talking about research papers maybe draft a visual abstract.

178
00:33:06,983 --> 00:33:15,983
Use it to draft an infographic that we might use or a poster.

179
00:33:15,983 --> 00:33:25,983
So let's go ahead and try some things in Jan Burt I'm going to walk you through it, we're going to go to slide to and Monica, if you don't mind, placing that in the chat.

180
00:33:25,983 --> 00:33:38,983
We'll just all meet in there and I'll demo some things before we do our activity.

181
00:33:38,983 --> 00:33:51,983
Okay. I'm seeing Philip says joined us Sarah has joined us. Pamela.

182
00:33:51,983 --> 00:33:55,983
Kathy.

183
00:33:55,983 --> 00:34:15,983
Can you come on in. Are you able to see it. Yeah, she just turned over, she did great. So as you can see on this practice jam board there are tools on the left hand side, which are Pen Tool eraser tool mouse tool, sticky note, shape, and then pointer

184
00:34:15,983 --> 00:34:16,983
tool.

185
00:34:16,983 --> 00:34:25,983
So what we'll be doing is just creating Sticky, sticky notes on this next frame.

186
00:34:25,983 --> 00:34:46,983
And if you can just take a few minutes to do this so when I create a sticky note, I will say, in this case I'll, I'll say, working from home is easy to be close to the fridge.

187
00:34:46,983 --> 00:35:07,983
If you don't mind just take a minute and click on this sticky tool over here with the little mountains and putting in taking notes on water benefits of working from home or on the left hand side, and then benefits of working in the office, you can create

188
00:35:07,983 --> 00:35:19,983
these sticky notes, and click on Save when you put them in there you can switch them around, you can have students pick a different color for.

189
00:35:19,983 --> 00:35:22,983
Yeah, now commute, right.

190
00:35:22,983 --> 00:35:28,263
no parking

191
00:35:32,427 --> 00:35:34,427
Okay.

192
00:35:34,427 --> 00:35:39,427
Thank you can all see how easy this is to use and

193
00:35:39,427 --> 00:35:54,427
how useful it might be kind of creating that conversation and thinking about maybe we would use it for pros and cons list. What are the pros of something, the left hand side, what are the differences between this and that.

194
00:35:54,427 --> 00:35:58,427
I'm going to move on to the next screen,

195
00:35:58,427 --> 00:36:01,427
just give you an example.

196
00:36:01,427 --> 00:36:09,427
We can use a graph. This is today's graph of covert cases. and we can mark up the graph here.

197
00:36:09,427 --> 00:36:15,427
Okay, Let's, let's look at

198
00:36:15,427 --> 00:36:20,427
today's date.

199
00:36:20,427 --> 00:36:44,427
Maybe we use other images and thinking about, okay, right now. It hurts a little bit. So, um, if we had time we could mark up some of these graphs and also show how as you're asking students to do things, you can have them create things on the fly, in

200
00:36:44,427 --> 00:36:47,427
real time, and markup graphs.

201
00:36:47,427 --> 00:36:52,427
Another example is maybe we're creating

202
00:36:52,427 --> 00:36:56,427
concept map.

203
00:36:56,427 --> 00:37:02,427
How different systems work together in public health.

204
00:37:02,427 --> 00:37:09,427
And, you know, maybe other students are interacting with that.

205
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:17,427
Or another example maybe this is an icebreaker for everybody puts in where they're from.

206
00:37:17,427 --> 00:37:22,427
And another one.

207
00:37:22,427 --> 00:37:24,427
Just a blank or.

208
00:37:24,427 --> 00:37:37,427
So, going back to you, Monica. Okay, thanks so yeah jam boards a fun one to work with as well especially in those live synchronous sessions but again if you had some pre populated things you could also have them doing that asynchronously as well.

209
00:37:37,427 --> 00:37:47,427
So the last one that we want to talk about a little bit is one that hasn't been used too much in the that I've seen in courses, and that is Google Sheets.

210
00:37:47,427 --> 00:38:00,427
And so, Google Sheets is great because it's a collaborative, you can collaborate on data analysis types projects and we have enough bio sets courses and enough statistics sites courses where this could be useful depending on you know how elaborate your

211
00:38:00,427 --> 00:38:03,427
statistical modeling that you're trying to do.

212
00:38:03,427 --> 00:38:19,427
But we can also have them for instance do individual contributions to a larger group data collection, analysis, and you can actually pre program, the sheets with formulas and crafts so that they get a real time view of the data changing and the graphs

213
00:38:19,427 --> 00:38:28,427
changing as the data are coming in. So, I also do teach a couple of courses and psychology.

214
00:38:28,427 --> 00:38:36,427
I've done one in psych with the lab and cogs like with the lab so I'm not going to actually show, I'll show you guys what this kind of looks like but I won't have you doing it for.

215
00:38:36,427 --> 00:38:52,427
Because of the time stream that we're on. So in this case, this is demonstrating this troupe effect in the strip effects simply says and cognition that we tend to read faster whenever words are printed in the same color they are listed there.

216
00:38:52,427 --> 00:39:03,427
The word is saying, so for instance when green actually is in green font we tend to be faster processing that then whenever there's an inconsistency between the meaning and the label, such as when green is printed in red font.

217
00:39:03,427 --> 00:39:18,427
So what I end up having students do is I have them go to this website, it's a strip effect tells you a little bit of about the strip effect, and they can read about that and then there's actually a ability to do a 92nd second demo of a strip task, when

218
00:39:18,427 --> 00:39:26,427
they when they complete this task, it actually gives them, you know their their data it tells them what their average time was for the concurrent tasks.

219
00:39:26,427 --> 00:39:39,427
And then what their time was for the income grunt test, and then it gives us an idea of what this truth, effect, time is so because I've already populated this with a little bit of some formulas in there and with the graph.

220
00:39:39,427 --> 00:39:54,427
When students start to do this experiment and they want to put in their data, we can see that those graphs will immediately change and they can kind of get the idea of, you know, real time, this experimental phenomena which is kind of neat.

221
00:39:54,427 --> 00:40:04,427
So you're more than welcome we'll share the slides at the end if you want to play around with that you're more than welcome to do so, this is linking up to that same lab sheet here.

222
00:40:04,427 --> 00:40:19,427
And then last thing I want to end on is the connection with Google Forms So Google Forms is basically been created as a survey administrator similar to like call tricks, or any other type of survey survey machine database.

223
00:40:19,427 --> 00:40:28,427
One of the great things about it is it's highly customizable it's a lot more customizable I think then even call tricks is, and as a variety of question types.

224
00:40:28,427 --> 00:40:42,427
You can add images and videos directly into your questions or in sections of the questions and responses can be anonymous. And then what's one of the best parts of it is that you can actually link the results that come from the Google Forms to a Google

225
00:40:42,427 --> 00:40:55,427
Sheet. And you can imagine how powerful this can be if you've also implemented for instance, your formula so it's extracting that data and then again, they can do a survey or they can do like a little quiz in there, and the responses will be populating

226
00:40:55,427 --> 00:40:56,427
in that Google Form.

227
00:40:56,427 --> 00:41:10,427
Another creative way that I've seen a Google Forms be created is through as an escape room activity, this seems kind of crazy and bizarre but I do have a link into that in case anybody's interested in seeing how somebody has created an escape room activity

228
00:41:10,427 --> 00:41:25,427
from Google Forms, these can also be used as formative assessments There's even an option in the Google Forms, to actually to get feedback, and to turn it into a quiz, which is kind of neat as well.

229
00:41:25,427 --> 00:41:38,427
So with that being said, this is the last one we want to actually show you guys how Google Forms works a little bit by providing you with a link to provide us with some feedback.

230
00:41:38,427 --> 00:41:50,427
So I'm going to copy this link, you can do that now or you can do that right after our session if you have any questions, and in the chat is the link to the actual g sweet feedback form.

231
00:41:50,427 --> 00:41:55,427
And if you're interested in seeing what the results look like from everybody which they are anonymous.

232
00:41:55,427 --> 00:42:09,427
You can see how that is linked directly into a Google Sheet as well so I'll put both of those in the chat.

233
00:42:09,427 --> 00:42:19,427
Now with that being said and ending all of that I want to talk a little bit about some of the other upcoming lunch and learns that we have going on.

234
00:42:19,427 --> 00:42:30,427
The next one coming up on November 3 at 12 is digital inclusion and accessible learning design this is going to be talking about how to be more inclusive with students with with accessibility issues.

235
00:42:30,427 --> 00:42:40,427
And then we're going to also talk about later in November, about our one of our newest tools in our toolbox and it's yellow regulating is really cool.

236
00:42:40,427 --> 00:42:55,427
It's actually a educational based social network platform. so it takes things like what you would normally do want a discussion board and makes it a little bit more hip and we're fun they have at comments they can share articles, and the students tend

237
00:42:55,427 --> 00:43:07,427
really like that. And the last one is kind of helping assist with prepping courses for the next semester and that is a Canvas course checklist that will be doing at the beginning of December, so.

238
00:43:07,427 --> 00:43:15,427
And if you're interested you can always sign up for those events at the calendar buttons for SPH.

239
00:43:15,427 --> 00:43:31,427
That gives us a couple more minutes. So I want to leave it up to you guys. Did you have any questions, anything that you'd like us to go over or any feelings about how the how the workshop when you'd like to learn more about.

240
00:43:31,427 --> 00:43:50,427
Hello, Monica. How do you, how do you link, the Google form to the Google Sheets, to the sheets yeah I can show you that Sure thing. So, let me open this form real quick.

241
00:43:50,427 --> 00:43:55,427
Well this is taking me to your side.

242
00:43:55,427 --> 00:44:03,427
You can do it in a couple of different ways I think in here, when you're actually in a sheet, there's an option of adding another piece.

243
00:44:03,427 --> 00:44:08,427
And there should be, see if I can find it.

244
00:44:08,427 --> 00:44:10,427
Here's one that says form.

245
00:44:10,427 --> 00:44:14,427
So it's going to take you over to create a form.

246
00:44:14,427 --> 00:44:24,427
And then what number I want to you know get the responses. So here's what I'm creating it the responses. You can see that there's that sheets icon right there so if I click the sheets.

247
00:44:24,427 --> 00:44:43,427
Now I know that this is linking the questionnaire, with the actual form. So here it is.

248
00:44:43,427 --> 00:44:52,427
So where do you see the response from the form they are in in a separate tab or Yes So down here on the bottom this is the form responses is showing me.

249
00:44:52,427 --> 00:44:53,427
Okay.

250
00:44:53,427 --> 00:45:05,427
Right now I don't have anything because this was an actually this is a blank one. This is a blank form that I haven't put any questions in for yet, but I can show you one that has been linked already, so this is the feedback.

251
00:45:05,427 --> 00:45:12,427
I'm with you real quick which common did you use to make the link that was in in file or.

252
00:45:12,427 --> 00:45:17,427
It's so when you're creating the form, it's this next one club responses.

253
00:45:17,427 --> 00:45:23,427
And this is where we can ask it to view the responses in the inner sheets.

254
00:45:23,427 --> 00:45:31,427
Oh, so did you do that from the, from the form itself from the form itself. Yep.

255
00:45:31,427 --> 00:45:31,630
Ok.

256
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:38,420
Any other questions.

257
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:45,420
Well, it's really nice to meet some of you I'm familiar with a few of you like Olivia.

258
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:57,420
But it's nice to meet the rest of you that I haven't seen yet in person so if you do have any comments if you have any questions about wanting to try and get any of your resources transferred into the Google suite tools or anything else feel free to reach

259
00:45:57,420 --> 00:45:59,420
out to us.

260
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:12,420
You guys have our email will send it out. The workshop slides in the video as well. And you can always, feel free to schedule an appointment with us and we'll be happy to help you.

261
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:13,420
Thank you everyone.

262
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:19,350
