1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:15,620
And. And this is lectures five and six and five and six are gram positive cocci, Gram Positive Rods and gram negative rods.

2
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:19,670
So I don't really think we're going to get too much to gram negative rods today.

3
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:25,520
I want to be able to answer any questions that you all have about Gram Positive Cocktail Gram Positive Rod and

4
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:32,810
then we'll do gram negative rods on the next class and answer any questions you have about the upcoming test.

5
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:43,480
OK. And remember, if you need to ask me anything, I'm not here, which most the time use my Gmail address, not my Umich address.

6
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:51,300
OK, let's. One more thing here. There we go.

7
00:00:51,300 --> 00:01:01,320
OK. Staphylococci side, I would say that staff causes more problems over time, over institutions,

8
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:11,370
over the public than any other organisms that I can think of because it is so he has the ability to create so many different types of infections.

9
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:19,140
So basic information nomenclature for the genus Staphylococcus if it is coagulation positive,

10
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:28,140
meaning that if you put an isolate in a tube of serum and you mix it up and you sit in at that level,

11
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,670
you wait at least half an hour, it will coagulate the serum.

12
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:42,270
If it's a staph aureus, that is, the querulous test. Staph aureus is always a pathogen.

13
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:50,850
You never say, Oh, we don't need to worry about this. No, you always consider staph aureus a pathogen and particularly if it's in a sterile site.

14
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:55,980
Now, when we talk about coagulation, negative Staphylococcus, there's a lot of them.

15
00:01:55,980 --> 00:02:03,930
And so you've probably heard about staph epidermidis and a lot of others, they may be pathogens, depending on the patient's immune response.

16
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:09,900
The site from which they were isolated. If the patient has hardware in,

17
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:19,860
there's a lot of reasons that the coagulase negative Staphylococcus that can cause disease and they can be as resistant staph aureus.

18
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:26,130
OK, so just because it's coagulation negative doesn't mean that you're not going to have problems if it's

19
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:33,250
in the spinal fluid or if it's in some other side treating it could have some resistance factors.

20
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:42,880
But typically, it is a contaminant and a non pathogen unless it gets in the wrong side in a person who has other issues going on.

21
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:51,400
So what's the epidemiology of the staphycocci? They are normal, Flora, our bodies are filled with staff, OK?

22
00:02:51,400 --> 00:03:00,610
Their normal floor of the skin and any mucosal membrane. So think your mouth, you throw your nose, your urethra.

23
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:12,620
Those are all mucosal membranes. The carrier said it is very high in the population and it is easily, easily transmitted by our hands.

24
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:17,030
So yes, we can cough on something and not cover the cost that could transmit it.

25
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:24,470
But these hands that we all watched a lot because we're into epidemiology and into microbiology.

26
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:34,670
But they are a great transmitter of staphylococci. So and and the thing to do if you really want to make your friends unhappy with you want

27
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:40,400
to watch them wash their hands and then you can tell them you didn't wash correctly.

28
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:47,150
Who are you telling me that I'm not washing my hands correctly? No, this is what you have to do if you really want to get them clean.

29
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:53,180
And so just the kids learned in kindergarten and first grade sing the Happy Birthday song twice.

30
00:03:53,180 --> 00:04:00,740
That's how long you have to wash your hands. And if they don't like that, they can sing any other song that that they want.

31
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:09,650
That's the same length, but that's how long you have to wash your hands. And it is critical to have good handwashing, not just OK, it's done.

32
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:20,620
That's not good. That is not good. OK, so let's talk about some of the diseases caused by Staphylococcus.

33
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:29,200
So the first one is that I hear localized skin infections. They can be followed calls that can be boils for uncles, uncles, you name it.

34
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:34,510
And here's an example of what we're talking about. You know what a boil looks like a franco has some.

35
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:40,150
It's raised up and it's got some red. Some red cells come into it.

36
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:47,140
It makes the tissue red around. It is inflammation, and the carbuncle looks like it's harder, almost like it's made out of cardboard.

37
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:51,280
I don't know how they came up with that name. And definitely the inflammation around it.

38
00:04:51,280 --> 00:05:05,430
OK. So when we talk about pathogenesis of Staphylococcus that we're primarily talking about staph aureus, the other stuff, of course,

39
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:15,820
that can cause disease, but they're not as important as staph aureus and staph aureus can cause toxin mediated diseases.

40
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:21,930
And so the first one is food poisoning. Have any has anybody here never had food poisoning?

41
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:29,760
One phone was it. Yeah. There's lots of different kinds of food poisoning, depending on the organism that you have ingested.

42
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:34,860
So staphylococcal food poisoning is caused by an internal toxin.

43
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:44,100
And during my 17 years of working in public health in Lansing, we investigated.

44
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:50,640
I was in the laboratory director, the laboratory. But working with the epidemiologists to investigate foodborne six outbreaks,

45
00:05:50,640 --> 00:06:03,060
Staphylococcus foodborne food poisoning shows up within about four hours of eating because due to the presence of a preformed toxin in the food,

46
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:07,770
OK, major signs vomiting no.

47
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:14,550
One Diarrhea is secondary or even third, but vomiting is the most important sign.

48
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:21,380
And with all that vomiting, if it's not controlled, the patient may need to have fluids.

49
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:27,680
OK, so that's food poisoning due to an internal toxin.

50
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:35,030
There's an exfoliating which causes scalded skin syndrome, and I'll show you a picture of that.

51
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:41,640
This is all on a second. This is.

52
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:52,230
Let's not start. This is an exo toxin that causes a blistering of the skin, and it's known as staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome,

53
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:58,380
and when you see a picture of it, you'll think, Oh my gosh, this poor child, it's usually seen as an influence on us.

54
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:03,240
As I said, I'll show a picture. And then there's two sets to one toxic shock syndrome toxin.

55
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:17,010
Does anybody in here not know about toxic shock? So it is a top toxin produced production, and it is life threatening.

56
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:22,350
OK, next slide. So here's a picture of scalded skin syndrome in a baby.

57
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:29,070
And not only does it look like the child's skin has been burned in many places, which is just horrifying to even think about it.

58
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:39,660
But you can see it the arrow that the skin is now beginning to peel because the damage has been so great.

59
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:42,960
OK. Let's talk a little bit more about staphylococcal food poisoning.

60
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:48,450
It is very common, unfortunately, sudden onset of nausea, vomiting and stomach cramps.

61
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:58,790
And most people have diarrhea, but the diary is not as it's not the same as the diarrhea from a gram negative food poisoning incident.

62
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:01,100
Symptoms develop fairly rapidly, as I said,

63
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:07,160
because it's a preform toxin that the person has ingested generally within four hours, sometimes it goes up to eight hours,

64
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:16,550
but generally the time frame is shorter after eating or drinking an item that had the staff toxin in it, and it lasted longer than one day.

65
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:19,910
So it's over rapidly and most patients get through it.

66
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:27,650
OK, except for that, oh, about twenty four hour period that they think they're going to lose their entire gastrointestinal tract.

67
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:32,390
It cannot be passed from person to person, so it's not like other food borne diseases.

68
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:36,380
We get a salmonella that could be passed. Person to person.

69
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:43,520
Generally, you don't need any antibiotics for this, but rehydration is critical, absolutely critical,

70
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:49,970
especially if it's a little kid who can't afford to lose that much fluid out of their bodies.

71
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:54,050
Absolutely need to be rehydrated.

72
00:08:54,050 --> 00:09:02,510
So the foods generally associated with StaffCop food poisoning, meats, particularly meats that are not handled correctly.

73
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:07,310
Poultry products always, always, always wash your hands.

74
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:10,660
As soon as you touch an egg shell, wash your hands.

75
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:18,290
Salads such as egg salad, tuna salad, chicken salad to salad and Macron one of all these have in common.

76
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:26,210
Mayonnaise, yeah, creamy things, bakery products such as cream filled pastries,

77
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:33,950
cream pies and chocolate éclairs again cream milk products, sandwich fillings in the milk and dairy products.

78
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:42,840
These are the most common types of foods associated with staphylococcal food poisoning.

79
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:48,090
So let's talk a little bit about toxic shock. I'm sure everybody in here has heard about toxic shock,

80
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:57,090
so it's due to a toxin that is in staph aureus and it's called Test one toxic shock syndrome toxin,

81
00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:04,160
and it's a pathogenic exo toxin biogenic, meaning it causes a fever.

82
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,190
And XO toxin means its shell.

83
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:19,070
And so the systems are the systemic effects include fever declamation, which is peeling of the skin and really very serious hypertension,

84
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:24,050
low blood pressure, low blood pressure, potentially leading to shock and death.

85
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:27,980
Yes, you have a question with this exact toxin. You again, Xingtai.

86
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:32,780
An endotoxin is in the cell wall and HEXO toxin is one that's shared by the bacteria.

87
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:37,790
OK. Any other questions?

88
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:46,890
OK. So let's talk a little bit now about pathogenesis.

89
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:51,150
We can have systemic infections, that means affecting the entire body.

90
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:57,660
Jim, we always consider the bacteria, so infection of the bloodstream is a systemic infection.

91
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:04,500
It can include any species, but certainly staph aureus is the most common.

92
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:13,920
But if someone has devices in the body, they could have a coagulation negative systemic infection.

93
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:19,140
There can be urinary tract infections, and here are particularly common in women.

94
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:27,780
I don't know how you guys escape but live in disease and the organism that most commonly causes this is Staphylococcus Zapper virulence,

95
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:36,150
coagulation, negative Staphylococcus common in the urinary tract of women.

96
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:43,200
And then central nervous system disease, and I always kind of give a side because when I think that,

97
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:50,700
uh, infections of the bloodstream are critical, CNS infections are even more critical.

98
00:11:50,700 --> 00:12:01,080
And these are associated with indwelling devices such as catheters, valves, hardware shocks, whatever they put into the body.

99
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:09,420
And most fabulous negatives staff disease is due to most serious diseases due to coagulation negative staphylococci.

100
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,310
So it's not staph aureus.

101
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:19,200
It's one of the ones that we think, Oh, they're not too bad, but if they get in the right place for them, wrong, wrong place for the person, it's bad.

102
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:30,800
And if they have hardware in there, they can colonize that hardware. And then sometimes the hardware has to come out.

103
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:36,290
So we talked about antimicrobial resistance last week, let's let's mention again,

104
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:46,670
so I'm sure everyone in here has heard of the term Mersa methicillin resistant staph aureus that's commonly known as Mersa.

105
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:53,960
We don't want to see it in the hospitals, but unfortunately it is in the hospitals and many people have it because they've had so many antibiotics.

106
00:12:53,960 --> 00:13:04,690
They've knocked out the normal flora. So there are screening programs to detect colonization in hospitalized patients.

107
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:13,240
And the screening programs work very, very well. And if a person comes up with a screen being positive for MERS-CoV,

108
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:22,480
then they will be put in isolation and they will be given appropriate therapy and the infection prevention, this will be on top of it.

109
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:29,440
So the next two, I've already mentioned a couple of times in previous lectures vancomycin, intermediate staph aureus or visa.

110
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:36,940
It's not a credit card, it's a bedbug. Why is it at the intermediate level resistance to vancomycin?

111
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:45,470
Because this organism has developed the ability to thicken its cell wall, and with that second cell wall,

112
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:52,480
the drug can't get in unless you raise the concentration of the drug in the patient.

113
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:59,170
And so the thicker cell wall is what we see with vancomycin intermediate staph aureus, the visa.

114
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:03,280
These don't grow very rapidly. We can't grow them in the laboratory.

115
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:08,410
But because of that Cipro, the vancomycin is less active.

116
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:13,180
Then we go to the worst, which is the first or vancomycin resistant staph aureus.

117
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:16,540
And this is a mersa that has acquired plasmids.

118
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:27,550
You know, plasmids are has acquired plasmids containing the BANJI vancomycin resistant gene from Enterococcus wicketless.

119
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:38,420
That is a very. Now what's unusual about this, which there are parts that are more resistant vehicles are fichier, anybody know?

120
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:49,820
Let's face him is more resistant, but this plasma that causes stuff came from our caucus chaos, which is supposed to be the more susceptible one.

121
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:57,000
It was an eye opening event when it all happened. OK.

122
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,200
Fortunately, we don't see it very often, but when you when it's reported, when you see it,

123
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:08,170
when you think of it, it's you sit up and take notice, you don't disregard it at all, ever.

124
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:13,480
So it's hard to teach microbiology without having a laboratory also.

125
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:23,830
So this is a picture of staph aureus on a sheep blood on your plate, and you can see here that the stuff is red.

126
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:31,060
Red is the red blood cells in the media, and the white colonies are staph aureus and there's a little zone of very hemolysis around it.

127
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:36,220
They don't necessarily have better hemolysis, which means slicing the red blood cells, but does.

128
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,770
And they're kind of creamy looking colonies.

129
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:44,830
Here's a close close up of some of them wolf like they have a center component to it, but it's just all the cell.

130
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:50,050
And here it is with a different kind of you with different light making it look very metallic.

131
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:55,720
But this is what it looks like on a sheep blood plate, and any tech will say this is staph aureus.

132
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:02,220
We need to do a susceptibility right away on this to make sure it's not resistant.

133
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:05,520
So how do we identify staphylococci?

134
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:13,830
This is actually one of the easiest IDs when you start looking at green IDs of gram negative, there's a lot of tests you have to do staff.

135
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:17,490
It's easy. So we look at the gram stating the morphology on a gram.

136
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:21,180
Still, gram positive cocks are in clusters.

137
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:28,770
OK, like a great cluster or anything else, it looks like that they don't have to have the shape, but just a cluster.

138
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:36,840
And then you can do a spot test for catalyzing. To do that, you have a glass slide.

139
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:42,030
You put a drop of hydrogen peroxide on it.

140
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:48,190
You mix a little bit of your organ in this organism if it bubbles. That's a positive catalyst test.

141
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:59,080
It takes less than a minute to do it. It's positive for staff, negative for Streptococcus and Enterococcus.

142
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:05,320
And then we do the coagulate test, and this stuff was really positive, and all the other stuff will be negative.

143
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:09,850
And for that, we need some serum basically from a foul or sheep.

144
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:20,080
And we have sterile so serum that we can buy from providers, science, scientific media providers, and we put somebody in a still test tube.

145
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:28,390
We mix in our organism from the blood on a plate, stick it in the incubator for at least an hour and take it out.

146
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:40,940
And if the serum is coagulated, that's positive tests positive for this test and that says staph aureus.

147
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:46,340
Now to ESPECIE Aid, the coagulate negative organisms.

148
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:55,070
We need a panel ID, it's too too bulky to do in tubes of different tubes of each when we do them in a panel of microplate.

149
00:17:55,070 --> 00:18:00,290
But the big differentiation here is catalase, which rules out strep.

150
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:11,050
And in our in our practice, the Enterococcus used to be a Streptococcus and then the Quigley's test rules out staph aureus from everything else.

151
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:19,300
Look, Streptococcus. The Streptococcus nomenclature is complex.

152
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:29,560
And it keeps changing. So it used to be based on where the colonies on sheep blood were the hemolytic or not.

153
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:37,150
Did they cause hemolysis, the red blood cells? And so if they like the red blood cells, so it was designed to pick up an office around the colony,

154
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:43,720
it was being hemolysis if there was just some grieving around the colony, so the cells were partially list.

155
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:50,310
That's alpha hemolysis. And if there's no hemolysis whatsoever, that's gamma.

156
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:59,910
So then Rebecca Lancefield, many, many, many years ago developed a means of typing the carbohydrates from baby hemolytic streptococci.

157
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:09,390
And they occur in groups ABC effigy. Now clearly the most common is Jeff.

158
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:18,750
But bistro causes urinary tract infections, causes very bad infections in newborns from moms who are positive and so on,

159
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:24,180
so they can cause some very, very bad diseases.

160
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:35,580
So some beta hemolytic streptococci produce identical carbohydrate engines in unrelated species just to make it more difficult,

161
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:40,520
and some genetically related species have saraj in this carbohydrate in,

162
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:48,600
and you can't really depend on those carbohydrate engines for identification if you want to do further identification.

163
00:19:48,600 --> 00:20:00,040
Group A, Group B, Group C and so on. You're going to have to go molecular in this day and age or a panel on a on a mobile right.

164
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:06,040
So where do you start, cos I live everywhere, almost normal flora of skin,

165
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:11,890
the mucosa of the upper respiratory tract, the genital urinary tract in the GI tract.

166
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:18,970
So they're all of our bodies, OK? And how does a person become infected?

167
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:27,100
Well, they can acquire an organism from another person. Person to person transmission or from their own strains that are in their body.

168
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:33,220
OK, maybe someone has a bad cough. It gets worse and worse is the strep throat.

169
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:43,780
They get into the chest, into the lungs and cause the moment. Maybe someone's treated a little roughly and something is transmitted.

170
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:52,780
There are a lot of ways to transmit Streptococcus I. So let's talk a little bit about pathogenesis here.

171
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:57,910
So stroke pilot tourism causes strep throat. This is the cause of strep throat.

172
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:01,090
It's Group A. And it is baby hemolytic.

173
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:09,220
So there's clearing around the colony on the blood of a plate, and it causes most common cause of acute pharyngitis is group.

174
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:22,500
Strep can cause skin infections that look like impetigo can cause very, very serious bacteremia and very serious systemic effects.

175
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:32,080
Can there can be a streptococcal toxic shock syndrome? Patient can have necrotizing fasciitis, which is flesh eating disease.

176
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:38,440
So just because they're not coming good, be strep pharyngitis, they can cause very bad things in the body.

177
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:46,150
And if they're in a place where they shouldn't be, they need to be treated. They have strep also have many enzymes.

178
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:52,450
They have many toxins. They have protein, which is a virulence factor.

179
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:58,380
So they're not our friends at all, even though they're all over our body.

180
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:02,670
And then there can be post-infection squalor also.

181
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:09,450
You all have heard of rheumatic fever, can be life threatening as a strep after a streptococcal infection.

182
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:16,620
There can be a careful marijuana Friday's, but if it's not treated, it can take out a person's kidney.

183
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:22,620
So there are, as I said, very, very serious side effects from the strep tragedies.

184
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:27,090
And so the reason for treating strep throat strep throat is not usually that bad, but it could be.

185
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:34,620
But the reason for treating strep throat is what I have here in bold prevent the sequelae.

186
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:41,370
You don't want to have further disease other than that strep throat, strep throat may give you a sore throat,

187
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:49,790
maybe you part may give you a fever, but it could get a lot worse if it's not treated.

188
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:54,680
OK. This is one of the ones that's worse necrotizing fasciitis.

189
00:22:54,680 --> 00:23:03,970
It is infection infection of the fashion overlying the muscles and can involve overlying soft tissues.

190
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:10,000
And you can lose an arm or leg, various organs and so on, and appetizing fasciitis.

191
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:19,880
There are three types that I've found listed here. Type one is probably microbial and may also involve Bacteroides or peprah Streptococcus species.

192
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:27,280
So when you think about Bacteroides and kept this trap, that would be from the intestinal area for the most part, not always, but for the most part.

193
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:36,370
Type two is mono microbial, so it's only one organism. It has Group A Strep in it, and it may be associated with staph aureus.

194
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:41,230
But I think that I've seen and heard of more common than have the other two types.

195
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:50,140
And then type three certainly occurs. Their pricing pressure is encouraged, but we don't have many marine areas around initiative.

196
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:53,120
We've got the big leagues, but there's no salt in them. The Great Lakes.

197
00:23:53,120 --> 00:24:05,990
So but there are organisms such as Eremos, hydroxyl and Vibrio species and others that can cause necrotizing fasciitis.

198
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:18,690
And acrimonious and pleasing, all of us are, even though they like sort were known to be particularly pleasing, most known to be in Michigan.

199
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:24,210
OK, now my favorite organism. Well, because I've written a lot about Strep A. Latvia.

200
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:32,460
It's not really my favorite or have a lot of publications. Group B strep generally beta hemolytic, but not always.

201
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:36,120
But if you were asked, you say yes, it's better hemolytic.

202
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:44,220
It can cause terrible neonatal infections following rupture of a mom's membranes as she's going into labor.

203
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:49,860
And so that's why pregnant women are always tested for Group B strep about midway

204
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:54,240
or towards the end of the pregnancy to make sure if if that mom is positive,

205
00:24:54,240 --> 00:25:01,500
they're going to be giving antibiotics during labor. So there's early onset neonatal disease due to Group B strep and late onset.

206
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:06,000
So early onset occurs between the time of birth and five days later,

207
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:14,110
and late onset occurs between day seven and day 90, and there are both very, very serious infections for the baby.

208
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:20,530
So once again, screening of pregnant women at 35 to 37 weeks of pregnancy has dramatically dramatically

209
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:24,970
reduce the incidence of early onset Group B strep hasn't done anything for late onset,

210
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:31,960
but it has reduced early onset. And at least if I hate to say this sounds terrible, the baby's a little bit older.

211
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:39,830
If they get it, OK, I don't want anybody to get it, but the baby would be a little bit older and a little bit easier to treat.

212
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:44,260
OK. Strep pneumonia, I.

213
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:56,150
Alpha Hemolytic looks like all the other half we people extract it can cause anything from an ear infection to pneumonia meningitis.

214
00:25:56,150 --> 00:26:02,300
And if it gets in the wrong place, it's serious. So many I see lots of good stuff.

215
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:11,670
I have a capsule and a capsule is on the outside of the cell and inhibits phagocytosis.

216
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:18,150
The white blood cells flip off a bit, it's slippery and they can't get around it to kill it.

217
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:21,750
So there are there are vaccines for adults and for kids.

218
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:28,650
Less than five years old, it's a 23 bailouts and 23 different types of probably safe rider in that vaccine.

219
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:37,120
And adults get it. And kids less than five years old can get it, and it is a very, very good vaccine.

220
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:46,000
I'm a big proponent of vaccines anyway. So now let's talk about this, as I said, Enterococcus used to be part stripped back.

221
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:55,690
OK, so there's Enterococcus comes in a few varieties that can be alpha hemolytic, beta hemolytic or gamma, no hemolysis.

222
00:26:55,690 --> 00:27:06,840
And the most commonly they have no hemolysis or a little bit of green, which is the alpha hemolytic most infections with Enterococcus or nosocomial.

223
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:11,590
And they might be a urinary tract infection after Rebiya endocarditis,

224
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:16,390
but generally it happens when something else is going on in that patient's body,

225
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:25,420
whether they're sick with some other disease, cancer, chemo, whatever it is they are, they're taking advantage of the situation.

226
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:30,220
So it's hard to think in bacteria taking advantage of anything, but they do.

227
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:34,240
So the other thing about enterococci is they can be multidrug resistant.

228
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,150
They can be terribly, terribly drug resistant.

229
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:45,580
And that contributes to the pathogenesis so they might be resistant to penicillin aminoglycosides and glycol peptides.

230
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:53,170
So the local papers would be like vancomycin and mailboxes are like doing.

231
00:27:53,170 --> 00:28:04,660
OK, so then they have some plasmids, also resistance chromosomes, so if chaos can contain bad and then be the same as Group B, still efficient,

232
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:07,780
contain DNA and then be Enterococcus,

233
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:17,770
Gallinari is shown here can contain Bansi on a chromosome and Enterococcus castle flavors can also contain Bansi on a chromosome.

234
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:21,910
So these they're not nice. They're just not nice.

235
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:32,940
And they're doing their best to stay active in people's bodies. So how do we identify?

236
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:39,570
I just gone through a lot of organisms, how do we identify them?

237
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:49,170
Well, the the micro well, we saw with the gram stain gram stated the specimen, we looked to see if there are white blood cells in it.

238
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:56,610
We look to see if those bacteria of those bacteria or other bacterial shapes that are predominant.

239
00:28:56,610 --> 00:29:00,380
So if you're looking at a sputum specimen.

240
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:10,020
You know, there's going to be squamous epithelial cells, but if you don't see polymorph or nucleus, there's probably something wrong with the patient.

241
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:14,990
Looks like they have a pneumonia, so they should be seeing probably more nuclear cells.

242
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:23,930
Now, if the patient has is on cancer chemo lab lacking white blood cells, you may not see those white blood cells,

243
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:30,950
but you will also see regular normal flora, as well as proof that whatever is predominating.

244
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:41,090
So for strep pneumo, we see gram negative side hairs, and there would be a lot of it would be predominating over everything else.

245
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:48,260
And that really the initial grams then gives the Technol Technology series the brand sense that no one is going to work on the culture.

246
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:55,670
But it's all in the computer. It's all on paper, whichever you have is using, and it gives the person who's who's looking at the specimen.

247
00:29:55,670 --> 00:30:01,050
The twenty four hours later, they don't get off of the plate. Oh yeah, but there's a lot of strep pneumonia.

248
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:08,900
What appears to be a long one after that first? Okay, so we can do direct antigen detection on specimens.

249
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:18,050
We can do a group strep throat, we can do strep pneumonia, pneumococcus from CSF, urine or blood cultures.

250
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:24,110
And why neglected to put on here? There are really very, very good molecular tests.

251
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:29,120
I suspect the patient has pneumonia or meningitis or something like that.

252
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:41,870
Many labs now have molecular tests that will identify the major pathogens that might be, say, in a bee seen causing pneumonia.

253
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:46,770
So it doesn't have it doesn't have everything in there, but it has the major pathogens.

254
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:50,370
OK, and then you can do that molecular test while you have a culture going.

255
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:55,670
And also you're not going to get initial culture results for 24 hours.

256
00:30:55,670 --> 00:31:05,870
But if you have a molecular test that says, interpret this feature in this first story specimen.

257
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:15,510
And you've got the you've got that molecular and you look at the culture that's loaded with the, you know what you're going after.

258
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:22,020
So when we do identification of bacteria or other organisms in the laboratory,

259
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:28,440
we have algorithms that we follow and then nationally standardized algorithms for how to identify organisms.

260
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:34,050
And some of the most of them are approved by the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute,

261
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:38,490
but they're also approved by American College of Pathologists and so on.

262
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:42,900
And so when we're talking about the positive side,

263
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:49,650
we would use that only blood auger and probably chocolate auger of the rest because that's when

264
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:55,740
we may or may not use a physiology mccarthy's for stool and for urine and things like that.

265
00:31:55,740 --> 00:32:01,080
But we would use the selective media, and one of the selective media is Merseyside.

266
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:04,320
The so it's an organism grows on versus select virus.

267
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:10,440
It's going to be worse off because it's got rid of antibiotics and that media to kill off everything else.

268
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:17,670
And we have differential orders that turn colors, different colors for a different organism that helps to raise this in a bit.

269
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:24,690
There's a selective strep auger for Group B strep throat and then for Group B Strep.

270
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:29,580
There's really strep brought GBS broth and Granada other in the colonies on Granada.

271
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:36,380
I will turn, I believe, the yellow yellowish OK.

272
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:43,400
So then I've already talked a little bit about the tabloid test, but I've got it in here again, so it demonstrates the presence of cameras,

273
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:49,330
which is an enzyme that catalyzes the release of oxygen from hydrogen peroxide that tells you if that's present.

274
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:57,410
Generally, three percent hydrogen peroxide is used for aerobic isolates and 15 percent hydrogen peroxide as used in animals.

275
00:32:57,410 --> 00:33:07,790
So animals take a lot more, a lot more stronger solution.

276
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:13,520
So we use a variety of different types of biochemical tests.

277
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:20,120
First one I've already talked about as a cavalry's test, this is a drop of hydrogen peroxide.

278
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:27,470
And if we see bubbling is positive, if it's positive and they gram positive, so we're going to do a quite stuff.

279
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:33,860
That's the algorithm. If the coagulation test is positive, it's separate if it's negative.

280
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:40,710
All we can report out at that point in time is coagulation negative Staphylococcus.

281
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:46,590
And sometimes we will work them up, and sometimes we won't.

282
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:50,580
If it is as it says, it is high numbers and choirboys, maybe the staff in Europe,

283
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:57,900
we will work it up and probably screen for staff or figures because that's the most common Staphylococcus causing urinary tract infections.

284
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:03,510
And the easy way that to identify separate focuses is tested against a normal bias.

285
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:08,760
And this if it's resistant staph starts physical, if it's susceptible to bias,

286
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:21,180
and it's another step you look to see if the organism is hemolytic octuplet or if it's baby hemolysis, it clears out.

287
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:34,410
The red blood cells is a clear zone around the colony Typekit with ABCDE and half you can do a camp test camp is no, it's not cyclic AMP.

288
00:34:34,410 --> 00:34:41,460
It's a test for Group B Strep when you see how it grows in the presence of other organisms.

289
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:44,550
If it's helping him, so there's greening around the colonies,

290
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:50,550
so this colony I see got overplayed in the media right at the edge of the colony looks kind of brutish.

291
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:58,950
That's alpha hemolysis. And here we would look to an aptitude test thinking that it might be a strep pneumo or aptitude or solubility.

292
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:05,610
They're almost interchangeable. If it's sensitive, like there's a zone around the opportunistic, it's going to be strep,

293
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:09,570
you know, if it's resistant, all we can say is alpha hemolytic strep.

294
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:18,540
We still can't put a name on it. And then if there's no hemolysis whatsoever, not out alpha, not beta, we can do a PCR test.

295
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:23,850
And that's just on a disk. And I can't pronounce peer Lana Del Aromatase and pronounce it.

296
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:29,130
And if it's positive, there's inhibition in the air.

297
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:30,960
It's an inappropriate.

298
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:39,480
And then if it's in their pockets, which in our pockets is a model or non-motor and that you do, have they semi-solid drive motor.

299
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:43,480
If it's muscle, it should be a castle flavius or down there.

300
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:55,080
If it's non-HDL, it's the more serious ones if you kill us or fichier and those are gram negative gram positive side, but they are gamma hemolytic.

301
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:58,230
They don't produce any hemolysis blood order.

302
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:07,140
So you can see a micro lot revolves around that growth on chiplet order and how the economies look on that she bled other.

303
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:11,370
So your staff Staphylococcus species on grabs.

304
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:15,810
What can we say, we can say gram positive cockfighting clusters, that's it.

305
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:25,270
We can't tell you anything else. OK, so here is the blood on your plate.

306
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:33,070
And we've got it's very hard to see here. Peter Hemolysis, can you see how that's kind of cleared out around here?

307
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:39,270
There is clearly if you could hold it, this one is much better if you could hold it up and why you could see the light through the plate.

308
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:45,690
OK. And then sometimes that force has gold colored colonies, sometimes they do, sometimes they don't.

309
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:50,760
It's not an identity specific ID feature, but if you see those, then that's probably self worth.

310
00:36:50,760 --> 00:37:02,760
Let's keep going. So here's coed negative staff and no hemolysis, they do the girls very well on cheap labor.

311
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:06,870
And then this is micro caucus and it used to be in what's called negative staff,

312
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:12,290
but it produces yellow columns, so it got its own genus and it's microscopic.

313
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:22,630
There are a number of different species generally not pathogenic, but in the right person, in the wrong place, it could be.

314
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:27,340
And now we have chromatin akara, and I mentioned this before, so this is Mersa criminogenic.

315
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:33,990
And it's only useful if you're trying to identify Mersa in a specimen without going through the biochemical tests and everything else.

316
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:41,210
So you strip the specimen or and isolate the plate. And if it grows and it's blue, it's mersa.

317
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:52,520
And this really helped identify organisms, this type of test before we got to know molecular using chromatin, it offers very, very useful.

318
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:56,990
So if you're using cryogenic lager, Iceland must be subculture twice from the original,

319
00:37:56,990 --> 00:38:03,150
so you're not hearing anything else along with it before performing a susceptibility test.

320
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:11,670
OK. Streptococcus, this is a gram stain on Mr. Gram positive Karzai in chains.

321
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:16,890
They are not generally as large as staph aureus or any other Staphylococcus.

322
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:29,520
And, of course, DAPA Staphylococcus. That would be a clusters, not chains. And this is an ideal gram stain that often don't look like this good.

323
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:35,790
And so now I've talked about BP strap in Group B Strep Group Strep has small colonies and a

324
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:43,890
very large stone baby hemolysis Group B Strep has larger colonies and a smaller sort of bed.

325
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:48,620
So if you look here.

326
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:59,240
If you look over here and you can see here, is the colony strap not inhibited by anything and a very large zone, a baby hemolysis.

327
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:03,560
And here the Group B strep side, the colonies are larger and the better.

328
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:13,680
Hemolysis is not nearly as clear, and there's not as much of it.

329
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:22,100
So when we talk about. Don't think hemolytic strep.

330
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:29,870
There's a lot of different streptococci that could be called out for hemolytic strep, most important one, I think.

331
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:35,180
So in the upper left hand side, we have a plate of pure alpha hemolytic strep.

332
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:39,440
The colonies look a little bit metallic. There's no hymnals and very little analysis.

333
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:45,740
Very, very little. You can see a little greening around some of them, like right here, right here, but there's very little.

334
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:48,890
OK, so how do we identify it? I've already told you this.

335
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:55,310
We used an opportunist. If we're not doing molecular or antigen and objectionable, inhibit strep pneumo.

336
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:59,330
So in the upper right hand side, the picture on the upper right hand side, you guys,

337
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:06,200
but arbeiten with the disk has opted for new low and a large sort of hemolysis.

338
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:11,630
No growth in the hip. It's inhibiting growth, not knocking acids, inhibiting growth and inhibiting.

339
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:18,620
If it inhibits growth, it's strep neuro. OK.

340
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:24,450
So on the bottom and I made this slide, I would have had a better camp test.

341
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:28,240
I don't like this one. But. It is what it is.

342
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:38,100
So we can't tell if it's a Group B strep without doing additional testing, and the test that's done is camp.

343
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:45,270
As I mentioned before, we take a streak of our staff or as we make that streets.

344
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:52,860
That's one of those top to bottom. And you can see hemolysis on both sides of it.

345
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:58,740
And then we make a streak of our suspect Group B strep perpendicular to that one.

346
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:04,770
And you look to see if the hemolysis of the staph aureus enhances the hemolysis of the Group B strep.

347
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:12,770
If that happens, it's going to be strep. And so you can see here the hemolysis has been enhanced.

348
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:20,780
OK, now there are better ways to do that than this test, but this is the type of thing that's in test questions.

349
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:26,810
Say that, but it is. And then finally, on the lower right hand side, we have a bad review,

350
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:31,820
which is generally not a pathogen unless it gets in like spinal fluid or something like that.

351
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:39,860
But an easy way to identify it is the satellite, and you can see what the statutory satellite in the growth of a by a on the sides of.

352
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:57,680
Tiny columns. So this is another way to identify Group B Strep and this is Granada other and you have Group B strep is present in its incubator.

353
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:02,980
You're not going to the other. When you look at the easy, it will be bright orange.

354
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:13,270
There's no question that's creepy strep. And you can do that either from a pure Iceland or you can do it from a vaginal swab.

355
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:18,130
OK, so one that's going to labor. Let's find this out now. You're not going to get this result for 24 hours.

356
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:25,050
So a molecular test would be more appropriate in that situation. But that's what a group.

357
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:38,200
Group B Strep Store Abakaliki Elephant dung on Granada Harbor. So we've talked a lot about different organisms, what about susceptibility testing?

358
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:42,640
What are the physicians supposed to treat the patients with?

359
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:55,070
I mentioned that some organisms have a lot of resistance factors, so well, therapy can usually start based on what's in.

360
00:42:55,070 --> 00:43:02,690
The resistance pattern commonly seen in a minute area susceptibility testing is necessary to provide

361
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:08,690
the physician and other health care providers with specific information about the patients isolate.

362
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:14,450
So for Staphylococcus species, I've already mentioned that it can have many, many resistance factors.

363
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:24,050
It can be resistant to multiple classes of antibiotics. Generally, we test all staph aureus, definitely all staph aureus from a sterile side.

364
00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:30,920
But staph aureus from a wound where there's a lot of Polley's presence and situations like that.

365
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:41,660
We would test Kohei Negative Staphylococcus if it's isolated from a sterile site such as inside of tissue or abscess,

366
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:54,300
inside tissue or from spinal fluid, etc. We can do for susceptibility testing, we can either do broad dilution, which most places do not do.

367
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:58,950
Tubes of different tools with different concentrations of drugs in them,

368
00:43:58,950 --> 00:44:06,660
but in a micro-targeted race so that you can inoculate it very rapidly and get results the next day automatically.

369
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:12,480
Or you can do this, you can still do this diffusion streak out, you know, sort of make a suspension of your organism,

370
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:19,650
streak it out on on a plate and drop your discs and then look at it the next day.

371
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:32,110
Now I should say I I probably will say this many times the organism can have resistance factors that are not showing the presence.

372
00:44:32,110 --> 00:44:40,270
Those resistance factors are not turned on. And then when they get in the presence of antibiotics, they get turned on.

373
00:44:40,270 --> 00:44:47,770
So when you first look at your new susceptibility to dust diffusion, it looks like everything's susceptible.

374
00:44:47,770 --> 00:44:54,310
OK, then you take subculture of that organism from around the disk that you're worried about.

375
00:44:54,310 --> 00:44:59,140
We're at the zone of inhibition. You take some of that organism and you do a susceptibility with that.

376
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:03,280
You grow it up. But concentration in a tube, you can.

377
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:12,170
Then if when you do your susceptibility, then you can demonstrate the resistance, so it doesn't always show up immediately.

378
00:45:12,170 --> 00:45:21,080
OK. Group based rap group Bistro Group based rap is actually easier to treat the group bistro,

379
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:27,110
so they're generally not resistant to penicillin, cephalosporins or vancomycin yet.

380
00:45:27,110 --> 00:45:30,470
Um, Group B Stroud has a lot more resistance factors than Group B.

381
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:39,740
Group Strep does. Resistance to the macrolides unless you refer my clindamycin group of antibiotics is increasing very rapidly,

382
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:44,930
so you cannot treat serious infections with macrolides.

383
00:45:44,930 --> 00:45:51,810
Serious infections with Group B, strep is maximized without doing the susceptibility to.

384
00:45:51,810 --> 00:46:00,840
Or, you know, you can. If it's from a sterile site, always do a susceptibility before starting therapy.

385
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:06,150
If it's from a pregnant mom, you're not going to treat the mom ahead of time,

386
00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:14,450
but you treat the mom when the baby's delivery is going on and you should have plenty of time to do that susceptibility.

387
00:46:14,450 --> 00:46:19,950
And you can do this diffusion, the Kirby Bower test, you can do broth dilution.

388
00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:27,330
And one thing to really look out for a Group B strep is inducible resistance for clindamycin.

389
00:46:27,330 --> 00:46:33,850
So if you can, it may not show initial resistance, but in the presence of restarting the process,

390
00:46:33,850 --> 00:46:41,990
the license could be served in the presence of clindamycin can be induced to be resistant.

391
00:46:41,990 --> 00:46:51,300
And it used to be that all pregnant moms were treated with clindamycin that's gone by the wayside.

392
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:56,200
OK, step strep pneumo can be very, very resistant.

393
00:46:56,200 --> 00:47:00,120
It's actually quite unusual now to find a susceptible stress level.

394
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:04,560
So we see resistance to penicillin, the cephalosporins in the macrolides, macrolides,

395
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:10,710
what's going on and clindamycin so you can test by whatever method you want distribution broth.

396
00:47:10,710 --> 00:47:15,540
If you have delusion, you can either way will show that you show the resistance.

397
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:24,150
We have different interpretive criteria for central nervous system versus non central nervous

398
00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:34,390
system infections for strep noodle because it depends on how much antibiotic can get to the site.

399
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:37,120
And then we have Enterococcus in there, Interfax, as I said,

400
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:41,580
used to be a Streptococcus and it can be much more resistant than the other Streptococcus,

401
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:53,020
I usually have to use cell all active agents, plus an amenable site to achieve sufficient Sitel activity.

402
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:59,320
It's not unusual to see the park sites that are resistant to all the clinically useful agents and that has been documented.

403
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:05,210
It's been written up and it happens not just in one place. It happens a lot of places.

404
00:48:05,210 --> 00:48:15,050
We test using prostitution. Yeah, we can we will see oftentimes see high level resistance to aminoglycosides, who want to say high level resistance.

405
00:48:15,050 --> 00:48:20,960
If it's low level, you know, you may be able to give the patient enough amenable eyesight to overcome that.

406
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:31,410
But if it's high level, it's not level. And then generally, do we do susceptibility testing and other stuff not listed from a sterile site?

407
00:48:31,410 --> 00:48:43,540
OK. And when you consider still site therapy, you have to make sure that the drug you're interested in using can get into that site.

408
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:51,030
So here's an exam type question, which of the following is the identification of a gram positive carcass.

409
00:48:51,030 --> 00:49:01,690
The forms, clusters, career positive and catalase, positive strep hydrogenase stuff, EPIs Enterococcus McAllister's staph aureus.

410
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:12,820
Which one is necessary? Right? Absolutely. Staph aureus, coed positive in catalase, positive.

411
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:21,550
So now we're in positive bacilli. And let me tell you why I'm only going to go through a very positive spin on the next class,

412
00:49:21,550 --> 00:49:25,170
we're going to go through the rest of this lecture and do a little review.

413
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:29,000
You can ask any questions you want before the exam next exam.

414
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:39,190
OK, so the solar species used to be considered totally non pathogenic, except, of course, for one that causes anthrax.

415
00:49:39,190 --> 00:49:47,530
But with all the immuno compromising conditions that we have now and the immunocompromised of drugs, it can be very problematic.

416
00:49:47,530 --> 00:49:52,360
It is aerobic, it is performing and it is a gram positive rod.

417
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:57,970
And generally they're fairly good sized. Not always, but fairly good size. But the epidemiology?

418
00:49:57,970 --> 00:50:02,770
Well, so listen, this is the most serious one.

419
00:50:02,770 --> 00:50:08,080
It's found in soil and it causes anthrax. Can I say anything more about that?

420
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:12,070
That's serious. It's very, very serious.

421
00:50:12,070 --> 00:50:20,710
Transmission is through inhalation of spores, and if you get stuck with a piece of wood that's been out in the yard.

422
00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:27,220
Another way to get anthrax that can be transmitted through mucous membranes of or ingested in foods.

423
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:32,440
So it has a wide variety of ways to cause infection.

424
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:40,000
But Bacillus serious is not as pathogenic as a three says it's found in nature, and it can also cause very serious infections.

425
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:45,220
How does a person become infected with it through traumatic introduction self,

426
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:54,130
a wound food or contaminated medical equipment, unfortunately, or ingestion of contaminated food?

427
00:50:54,130 --> 00:50:58,900
Bacillus serious could certainly cause food borne disease outbreaks.

428
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:04,210
So there are many other species of bacillus in the environment, but most of them are considered nonpathogenic.

429
00:51:04,210 --> 00:51:07,180
These are the two that we have to think about. And in what?

430
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:13,840
Thirty seven years of doing clinical microbiology, the self-serious has seen a lot of foodborne outbreaks due to be so serious,

431
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:19,450
but not as many as salmonella and other organisms.

432
00:51:19,450 --> 00:51:23,710
And I've only seen, I think, maybe one suspected case of anthrax.

433
00:51:23,710 --> 00:51:36,520
Fortunately, it was scary as all get out. So what's the pathogenesis of a visual sense, racist?

434
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:43,570
It has a council, and by now we all should recognize that if an organism has a capsule, it is Anti-Flag acidic.

435
00:51:43,570 --> 00:51:48,250
It's slippery, the pollies can't get around it to engulf it.

436
00:51:48,250 --> 00:51:54,100
So that's one factor. It also produces a number of different toxins.

437
00:51:54,100 --> 00:52:02,190
There's an edema toxin, so people swell up and there's a lethal toxin that destroys tissue.

438
00:52:02,190 --> 00:52:12,120
There are various diseases caused by Bacillus anthracis as cutaneous anthrax due to a cut or a wound pulmonary also called mole sorters disease,

439
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:21,770
because what used to happen was when sheep will be sheared, then the people who would take the shearings and they're kind of a mess.

440
00:52:21,770 --> 00:52:26,100
The big pile of sheared wool, they have to sort through it,

441
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:35,550
and the sheep live outside in the fields and fields could be infected with that organism or have the organism in the fields.

442
00:52:35,550 --> 00:52:41,160
And they didn't wear masks or anything, and they would get pulmonary anthrax.

443
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:49,140
Or cutaneous anthrax, if they got caught and they might get high doses of anthrax, never, ever any good.

444
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:55,320
If you ever hear if you're working as an infection prevention test or a public health

445
00:52:55,320 --> 00:53:05,340
and you hear that they suspect anthrax from the patient's job or symptoms or something.

446
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:13,020
It's always serious. This is a lethal disease.

447
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:20,280
It can spread rapidly throughout not just the patient, but other people will take care of the patient throughout rooms, in a hospital and so on.

448
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:25,450
It is very, very serious. If it's suspected.

449
00:53:25,450 --> 00:53:30,640
You call public health, you call infectious diseases. OK.

450
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:37,030
And we'd rather have you be wrong than not tell people what's going on.

451
00:53:37,030 --> 00:53:41,170
Nobody's going to point the finger at anybody to, hey, you don't want to talk to them.

452
00:53:41,170 --> 00:53:48,930
No, they will jump in and take the necessary precautions, so there's no spread to anyone else.

453
00:53:48,930 --> 00:53:52,890
OK, but so serious, we used to think that was nonpathogenic, we were wrong.

454
00:53:52,890 --> 00:53:58,270
It has internal toxins that it has pathogenic toxins, fever causing toxins.

455
00:53:58,270 --> 00:54:02,250
Oh, there's a diuretic, the diarrheal form and a medic for a minute.

456
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:07,140
Maybe you're vomiting a lot. And it causes food poisoning.

457
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:14,620
OK, so most people don't realize that this ulcers can cause food poisoning, and then it can cause post-traumatic infections.

458
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:19,860
So I've got some of the stuff in the eye, which is horrible even think about.

459
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:23,800
But they're working outside or they're chopping one piece what flies up into their eye?

460
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:30,630
They don't have the goggles on something like that. They can get an infection with the so serious there can be endocarditis, there can be bacteria.

461
00:54:30,630 --> 00:54:33,940
And yes, it's difficult to treat.

462
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:43,540
So now, through our friend, whole genome sequencing, there are over 100 genera of Bacillus, and I'm not telling you all of them.

463
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:47,740
I'll tell you the most important here what's in our nonpathogenic?

464
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:51,790
They're commonly seen in the clip. Microbe Club Microbe.

465
00:54:51,790 --> 00:54:58,540
About five percent of these are political significance and opportunistic pathogens.

466
00:54:58,540 --> 00:55:06,340
So working in the clinical lab, if we see a culture plate in its form of one, I'm is going to pull it off and identify it.

467
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:11,440
Make sure the supervisor or the director of the micro lab will call whoever,

468
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:18,340
whatever infectious disease physician is working with that patient and say, Hey, we've got something really unusual here.

469
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:25,950
I take it from there. OK, listeria monocytogenes.

470
00:55:25,950 --> 00:55:32,130
It is a small, thin gram positive rod, it's catalase, positive.

471
00:55:32,130 --> 00:55:38,250
It can be found as part of the normal GI flora can be found in the environment and found in certain animals.

472
00:55:38,250 --> 00:55:44,010
How is it transmitted through ingestion of contaminated food, both meat and dairy?

473
00:55:44,010 --> 00:55:50,010
And it could also be pet passed during labor months the baby.

474
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:57,670
So that is not nearly as common as ingestion of contaminated food that would be much more common.

475
00:55:57,670 --> 00:56:05,080
What is the genesis for this organism that has a toxin that's called a listeria license that you Mollison inside a

476
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:15,320
toxin and a promise from the permits the bacteria to remain viable within macrophages that they just can't kill off.

477
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:21,680
This organism can cause bacteria can cause meningitis, usually in neonates or the immunosuppressed.

478
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:30,620
So I think the reports used to be more much more common in neonates, though with appropriate practices and cultures and so on.

479
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:37,340
We don't hear of it nearly as often as we used to.

480
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:42,330
Without the current bacteria species, we used to think of them as all there and there's nothing wrong with them,

481
00:56:42,330 --> 00:56:50,380
they're just part of our normal flora. Right? Well, they're playing Morphic, their family's positive and they're very positive rods.

482
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:57,710
They're they are part of our normal for upper respiratory tract skin flora, nothing on the floor of animals.

483
00:56:57,710 --> 00:57:05,540
We can have transmission person to person or from the environment. So what are we no one organism to worry about what we don't see?

484
00:57:05,540 --> 00:57:11,870
Hardly at all. Unfortunately, by that term, the theory causes diphtheria.

485
00:57:11,870 --> 00:57:21,230
The organism crying about two to three has multiple toxins. It has an hexa toxin to destroy cells by inhibiting protein synthesis.

486
00:57:21,230 --> 00:57:26,510
It can cause non-healing ulcers and cutaneous lesions.

487
00:57:26,510 --> 00:57:36,020
If a patient has respiratory diphtheria, which is the most common form of form, Pseudomonas actually did so they can't swallow.

488
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:41,750
There will be respiratory compromise. They have trouble breathing. They definitely will be intubated.

489
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:48,560
And then, of course, there's the toxins in the toxins affect organs that cardiotoxicity, the neurotoxin and so on.

490
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:55,520
So fortunately, in the United States and in many, many other countries, children are vaccinated for this.

491
00:57:55,520 --> 00:58:06,780
But it is not the the that it's very unusual to hear of that, that they're causing disease nowadays.

492
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:10,050
So what do we do for laboratory diagnosis?

493
00:58:10,050 --> 00:58:22,170
So we need a specimen in a lab and we have to have it collected appropriately so and transported rapidly and do the right processing.

494
00:58:22,170 --> 00:58:26,100
There are no special requirements to get the specimen to us,

495
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:33,510
so we have various types of transport media that we use in microbiology of the specimen is collected with a swab.

496
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:39,030
No one is not always right to collect the specimen with the swab because sometimes you don't get enough specimen.

497
00:58:39,030 --> 00:58:44,850
But if you do so, say for a throat culture collected with a swab,

498
00:58:44,850 --> 00:58:52,800
the swab will be a tube that has transport media and will keep the number of organisms in the same same values.

499
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:58,720
They won't let it multiply. Woman, Diane just supports what's there without additional growth, so nothing is overgrown.

500
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:08,040
What it should do when you look at the culture, if it's a urine, it gets submitted in urine transport media,

501
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:11,700
which has the same effect that keeps everything in the same numbers and so on.

502
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:19,170
If it's a tissue. We want sent to the laboratory from the right away is still failing.

503
00:59:19,170 --> 00:59:24,720
And so we have guidelines that we make in conjunction with our infectious

504
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:32,460
diseases colleagues and try and get them instituted throughout the institution.

505
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:37,020
So and we want the specimens in the lab as soon as possible.

506
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:42,000
We can't we can't give adequate therapy to a patient without knowing what you're treating.

507
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:47,010
So the sooner we get the specimen into the lab, the sooner we can start processing and doing what we need to do.

508
00:59:47,010 --> 00:59:51,360
So if it's Bacillus serious, it would be from suspected food poisoning.

509
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:54,820
And you can treat the specimen.

510
00:59:54,820 --> 01:00:04,990
Whether it's stool or vomit with a heat shock or an alcohol shock, because both of those specimens, the vomit, this will come up through the throat.

511
01:00:04,990 --> 01:00:12,790
And so it's picking up all the bacteria in the throat, in the mouth. And if it's stool, do you know how millions of organisms in stool?

512
01:00:12,790 --> 01:00:19,540
But you can either cold shop or alcohol shock the specimen and only Bacillus serious will survive.

513
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:29,790
The spores will survive in the mouth and. If it's listeria suspect listeria from a placenta, it's very difficult to isolate,

514
01:00:29,790 --> 01:00:39,910
we might have to do a cold in Richmond at four degrees for several weeks might even take months to grow listeria from some specimens.

515
01:00:39,910 --> 01:00:47,680
And now for the direct detection, if it's Bacillus, we see large gram positive rods, the size will vary with the species.

516
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:52,150
We cannot speak from the brainstem, but we can say a large gram positive rod.

517
01:00:52,150 --> 01:00:59,470
We can do a sports deal with malachite green, and we can say whether or not there are spores present.

518
01:00:59,470 --> 01:01:06,680
If there are spores, the location of the spores helps identify whether they're terminal or whether they're in the center of the cell.

519
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:11,050
Identifying. If it's let's do another very positive, right?

520
01:01:11,050 --> 01:01:21,550
But it's much smaller than the bacillus species. They may form if it's a steer, they may form short chains of three to five bacteria together,

521
01:01:21,550 --> 01:01:27,220
and they can even be confused with Streptococcus because they're so short.

522
01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:32,890
And then if it's Proteobacteria, we always talk about power saving grandpa's arrival by Chinese leaders.

523
01:01:32,890 --> 01:01:34,850
Sometimes they do, sometimes they don't.

524
01:01:34,850 --> 01:01:45,380
Most text nowadays have not seen this, so it would be something that would be sent into public health or to a large reference lab.

525
01:01:45,380 --> 01:01:52,590
So here's the Bacillus species, grandpa's abroad with spores.

526
01:01:52,590 --> 01:02:03,300
And you can see where the there's the hand of the cell and you see where the cell ends and then there's another cell and another cell and so on.

527
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:12,510
OK, so that's gram positive. They don't, they don't usually look at it. This is a serious, short term positive rod.

528
01:02:12,510 --> 01:02:23,770
Much shorter than that Bacillus. We see the difference. And then this is something I just downloaded.

529
01:02:23,770 --> 01:02:29,740
This is a Chinese trying to demonstrate what Chinese letters look like.

530
01:02:29,740 --> 01:02:40,180
OK, so nonperforming small, slender gram, positive rods exhibiting a tendency for people more fearsome intends to remain attached to radicals,

531
01:02:40,180 --> 01:02:49,210
giving it the Palisade in a Chinese letter gram stain morphology and produces small colonies.

532
01:02:49,210 --> 01:02:57,430
OK. And this could be a listeria. This could be a kind of bacteria.

533
01:02:57,430 --> 01:03:06,890
And here's another cry that your gram stain gram positive rod little bit larger than the others.

534
01:03:06,890 --> 01:03:10,070
OK. How do we identify the how do you culture them?

535
01:03:10,070 --> 01:03:14,660
So let's talk a little bit about molecular methods, but you can't just do molecular without doing the culture.

536
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:22,730
Also, because you need the organism for that susceptibility or for molecular test to see, if see, if one patients isolate matches another.

537
01:03:22,730 --> 01:03:26,360
Is that an outbreak going on? So we really need to get that isolate out.

538
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:30,290
So Bacillus grows very well on blood sugar and chocolate.

539
01:03:30,290 --> 01:03:34,970
I have no problem growing in the various colonial morphologies.

540
01:03:34,970 --> 01:03:38,240
It could be smooth, it could be very clear and have different colors.

541
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:46,730
White, gray, green has a lot of different appearances, some basal species or even better hemolytic.

542
01:03:46,730 --> 01:03:56,600
So usually even though a gram stain colony morphology, you can call your favorite IT physician and say, Well, you let me go there and say, Hey,

543
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:59,060
this is what I think it is, but I'm going to have to send it out,

544
01:03:59,060 --> 01:04:03,150
or we're going to have to identify it and get a full identification of the susceptibility for.

545
01:04:03,150 --> 01:04:14,310
OK. It says Ford is not warranted, sometimes it is, sometimes it is, and if it's a an outbreak, yes, we need a full identification.

546
01:04:14,310 --> 01:04:22,200
Generally, we consider the source of the contaminant until it gets into a site where it shouldn't be like a sterile site.

547
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:32,550
So as we don't see the source anthracis, if there's a Bacillus anthracis, as I said, that this is a huge issue, a huge issue in the United States.

548
01:04:32,550 --> 01:04:48,320
Non-marital non hemolytic on one order. So you can't really tell them apart based on how they grew on the plate, on the left, is this all serious?

549
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:49,970
On the right is the source of crisis.

550
01:04:49,970 --> 01:04:59,720
The colonies look the same, except this all serious in this one has somebody hemolysis that we are not seeing with Bacillus anthracis.

551
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:10,960
Even a suspense suspect that traces of an anthrax is a huge emergency, public health emergency, hospital emergency and so on.

552
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:15,130
So how do we identify listeria, small gram, positive rod?

553
01:05:15,130 --> 01:05:22,930
Well, chocolates a small colonies, they might be white, they might be translucent, they should be most of my baby hemolytic.

554
01:05:22,930 --> 01:05:28,540
I shown you the picture that they're positive for camp. OK.

555
01:05:28,540 --> 01:05:34,440
And they have an umbrella type of motility. Who's doing what a colony.

556
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:40,540
You can see the utility like. Yeah, and there are countless positive.

557
01:05:40,540 --> 01:05:46,940
And this is what listeria looks like on a lot on your plate, small colonies, this one is not baby hemolytic,

558
01:05:46,940 --> 01:05:54,770
but when you come over here, you have an umbrella of growth here when you stab it into semi-solid auger.

559
01:05:54,770 --> 01:06:04,490
See how it's grown out. OK, right, a bacterium.

560
01:06:04,490 --> 01:06:09,410
Most of them grow very, very well on blood chocolate. No problem with that.

561
01:06:09,410 --> 01:06:15,650
If you suspect that you might have a diphtheria, you require a selective and differential medium.

562
01:06:15,650 --> 01:06:22,550
The differential maybe has to be freshly prepared. And I would guess that 99 percent of clinical microbes don't make media any more.

563
01:06:22,550 --> 01:06:26,960
So to get freshly prepared media is really difficult. So what do you do in this case?

564
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:30,560
You call public health, where you call mail, where you call something like that.

565
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:35,390
So I've got probably public health and say I've got a suspect case about him diphtheria.

566
01:06:35,390 --> 01:06:41,030
We're going to have a career. Bring it to you this afternoon.

567
01:06:41,030 --> 01:06:45,150
OK. In Telluride,

568
01:06:45,150 --> 01:06:55,290
the colonies will be black with dark brown halos around them in the media and exquisite that since assistant tell you either black or white colonies.

569
01:06:55,290 --> 01:07:00,000
You can see other bactrim species. They may be identified occasionally.

570
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:05,910
Usually there are contaminants, but in the right person, in the wrong place, it could be a problem.

571
01:07:05,910 --> 01:07:14,540
So those who do remember is that listeria looks very close to what kind of bacterium the Blackburn posture a small, very positive.

572
01:07:14,540 --> 01:07:18,480
So these need to be identified as rapidly as possible future growth.

573
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:27,770
If you have multiple people, which most labs have now to identify and that will differentiate the two.

574
01:07:27,770 --> 01:07:34,220
And this is of a my assist in Telluride all year, and even though this picture is in black and white, that's exactly what it looks like.

575
01:07:34,220 --> 01:07:45,940
The colonies are black. OK, susceptibility, testing and therapy.

576
01:07:45,940 --> 01:07:52,760
So. Am I see guidelines exist?

577
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:59,480
But the only test in severe disease? But.

578
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:04,160
The the the things have changed. This used to be an old guideline.

579
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:10,660
If an isolated is obtained from a sterile site, there will be susceptibility testing performed.

580
01:08:10,660 --> 01:08:19,150
But with Bacillus, most floods are not set up to do susceptible testing for Bacillus species that would go to a reference lab for public health.

581
01:08:19,150 --> 01:08:25,150
Listeria is easy. Penicillin ampicillin, it's easy to do those.

582
01:08:25,150 --> 01:08:28,930
Once again, the theory is also always resistant to such reactions. Always, always, always.

583
01:08:28,930 --> 01:08:38,770
People want to go to a third generation cephalosporin because it works better not with listeria, but about bacterium diphtheria.

584
01:08:38,770 --> 01:08:48,240
You patient needs and a toxin, which is not something with a clean microbe, can provide plus penicillin or with license.

585
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:59,340
They need the vaccine when they get well, and he talks like other species of protein that you so far are susceptible to vancomycin.

586
01:08:59,340 --> 01:09:09,550
But it should not be in theory, I. OK.

587
01:09:09,550 --> 01:09:16,960
This is as far as I'm going today, I'm going to finish the rest of their Arabic at am I see 10 numbers on the next lecture?

588
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:30,950
OK, does anybody have any questions? OK, so the next lecture will be Wednesday, and then on Monday there's a test, the first test.

589
01:09:30,950 --> 01:09:39,830
OK. And we'll try and go do a little bit of a review on Wednesday also.

590
01:09:39,830 --> 01:09:47,410
And I expect everybody to get 100 percent, 98 percent if you have to miss one or something.

591
01:09:47,410 --> 01:09:52,640
OK, OK, wonderful. I cannot stress enough.

592
01:09:52,640 --> 01:10:00,650
If you have access to the textbook, please use it to study also because there not I cannot say everything and you need the information.

593
01:10:00,650 --> 01:10:05,800
Everybody needs that information to please also study the textbook. OK.

594
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:23,969
Have a wonderful evening. Hopefully, it'll stop snowing.
