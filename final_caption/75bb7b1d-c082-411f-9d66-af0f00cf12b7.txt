1
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:10,520
20 minutes ago. I had no idea I should.

2
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:19,380
I was spending like her, like, 24 hours.

3
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:32,550
All right. Hey, good morning, everyone. So last class period, we had our guest lecture, Professor Neitzel, who came and spoke on physical exposure.

4
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:36,560
Right. And you got a nice break from having to listen to me opponents there.

5
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,210
Well, we're lucky.

6
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:49,110
Professor Neitzel will be back a little bit later in the semester to talk about occupational exposure limits and standards and regulations.

7
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:56,489
So we're kind of going to continue going through this kind of systematic, uh, classification.

8
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:03,450
So last period with um, physical exposures, this class period, we'll discuss specifically chemical exposures.

9
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:11,410
And then on Thursday we'll discuss biological exposures and we'll have another guest speaker.

10
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:18,960
Well, I'll tell you more about on Thursday, but Professor John Meeker, who again, another topical expert to come and speak about that.

11
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:29,610
Any questions before we get started, not just about physical or chemical exposure, etc., but anything about the class, about this guys raw material?

12
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:36,240
All right with that, let's go ahead and jump in.

13
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:48,690
In terms of competencies, you know, basically an introduction to the many, many, many chemicals that we are concerned about being exposed to.

14
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:55,950
Anybody remember from the the random factoid from the first day of class, how many chemicals are in U.S. commerce?

15
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:03,950
85,000. Yes. Give or take a few. That's a ballpark approximate.

16
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,610
Absolutely. Uh, so what do we do?

17
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,670
We have 85,000 chemicals that we're concerned about.

18
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:14,260
Like we can't start class with. Okay, well, number one. Right.

19
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:20,180
Number two. Uh, so there are some ways to approach it and different ways.

20
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:24,620
And we're going to kind of go through how some of those different ways might be,

21
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:29,000
where they might make sense and where other schemes might might make sense.

22
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:40,520
So we'll talk about some of these classification schemes. And then just to be aware of the numerous factors and that relate to being able to

23
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:49,610
recognize and evaluate these chemical exposures and the impact of risk to our health.

24
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:53,420
I'll give you a little bit of advance notice.

25
00:02:53,810 --> 00:03:00,590
We'll get through most of the material and then we'll have a chance to watch a short video in class together.

26
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:06,919
And then we can finish the class period with a little bit of discussion around that kind of some examples of what we're discussing,

27
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,090
a little bit of application.

28
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:15,700
And I am purposely also trying to do that, like interrupting, you know, my constant lecturing, like having some breakouts.

29
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:17,060
We have the in the news.

30
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:25,640
I will do some other interactive exercises in class over the course of the semester, but this is another one is to play like short videos as well.

31
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:30,120
This one, I think is about 15 minutes or. All right.

32
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:37,800
So how do we get a handle on, you know, how to approach these 85,000 ish chemicals that we're concerned about?

33
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:42,420
And there's a number of different classification schemes we're going to actually step through each one.

34
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:54,070
Uh, but one way to approach them is by their nature, for example, are they organic chemicals or inorganic chemicals?

35
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:56,640
Right. This might be a viable approach.

36
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:04,860
Uh, either source we've already talked a little bit about different sources of emissions in this case, specific to chemicals.

37
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:13,920
We might classify them by natural sources of chemicals submitted to the environment versus anthropogenic or those from human activities.

38
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:23,490
We might classify them by the medium that they're found in and more specifically by that route of exposure.

39
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:29,640
We might classify chemicals that are specifically a risk of inhale inhalation exposure, right?

40
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:39,300
You're breathing them. It might be chemicals that are classified through primary right of exposure, through ingestion, skin contact, etc.

41
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:44,960
We might classify chemical exposures by youth.

42
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:49,410
So certain practices, whether they're in the workplace or in the community,

43
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:56,790
certain our own personal behaviors and what commonly exposes us to maybe a certain set of chemicals,

44
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:03,000
how we might classify chemical exposures based on the mechanism of action.

45
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:11,340
Right. So chemicals that target or that are toxic to specific organs within our body, we might classify them that way.

46
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:20,220
It might be by environmental properties. Right. So those that are greenhouse gases, for example, or those that bio accumulate in the environment.

47
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:26,970
And then just various, you know, kind of physical chemical properties, whether they exist as a gas,

48
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:35,250
a liquid aerosol like in the air, they're soluble or inert, reactive, etc.

49
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:43,560
Let's go ahead and step through each of these schemes and kind of talk to you some examples one by one, where they might make them upset.

50
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,090
So we'll start with classifying chemicals by nature.

51
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:53,220
Right. So either organic or inorganic are some really basic definitions here.

52
00:05:54,630 --> 00:06:01,230
Organic chemicals that we commonly and that really bothers me, like when we talk about organic food.

53
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:09,420
Right? Like all food is meets this definition all made up of at least one carbon atom, usually at least one hydrogen atom.

54
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,470
Anyway, this is the formal definition of an organic chemical.

55
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:17,880
The simplest organic compound is methane.

56
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:22,950
ch4. So as an example, we can talk about methane.

57
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:34,590
And actually I'm going to kind of cross this scheme and maybe talk about some of these other characteristics as we step through it.

58
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:42,810
So methane in terms of its structure, it's considered an alkane hydrocarbon in terms of its sources.

59
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:50,579
It has both natural as well as anthropogenic sources in terms of the medium that

60
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:59,310
we might find it in its present day in soil air often usually has a gas its uses.

61
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:08,190
Uh, it is uh often used in fuel both for heating, generating electricity and so forth.

62
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:16,220
It's toxic mechanism to humans for the most part is as a, uh, a chemical extant, right.

63
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:21,480
So basically displacing the oxygen that we would otherwise need and have in our lives.

64
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:29,660
Uh, because of this, uh, the time course is short.

65
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:39,659
It would be an acute exposure, right? So being exposed to probably a relatively high amount of methane over a very short period of time.

66
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:45,420
Right. In order to displace enough of that oxygen in our lungs, a target organ to have some question marks in there,

67
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:49,520
because the exact mechanism might vary from one person to the other.

68
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:53,280
Um, but it could have effects, you know, just directly on the brain.

69
00:07:53,280 --> 00:08:01,859
And then downstream from there or other aspects within the body, uh, we could classify methane by its environmental properties, right?

70
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:05,580
It has some important ones. Methane itself is a greenhouse gas.

71
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,740
Uh, methane interacts with ozone two different ways.

72
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,059
Uh, it can be a contributor to forming ozone in the troposphere, right?

73
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,890
So where we breathe it and where we don't want it,

74
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:24,090
it can also contribute to destruction of ozone in the stratosphere where we do want it as a protective layer.

75
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:31,770
We'll talk more about ozone chemistry later on in the semester and then it's Physicochemical Properties, right?

76
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:38,850
I mentioned it's primarily existing as a gas. It's conscious, it's relatively inert, although it's flammable.

77
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:49,260
And this is how it's used as a fuel. And it's it's of course volatile and its existence as a gas at an atmospheric temperatures.

78
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:57,000
All right. So contrasting that that was an example of an organic chemical that was considered an inorganic chemical.

79
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:04,710
Uh, and again, by definition, these are primarily compounds that lack, uh, carbon and hydrogen.

80
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:11,820
Uh, inorganic chemicals can be individual elements, they can also be compounds.

81
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:17,239
And a classic example, of course, is. Is left here in the image.

82
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:23,690
We have a tetra ethyl lead that was used as a fuel additive.

83
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:34,580
Right. We talked about this earlier a couple of class periods ago, gasoline and then kind of going through some additional classification.

84
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,949
It can exist as elemental and it can also existence of some other forms.

85
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:47,630
Also has Nagano metallic, uh, sources, uh, or with gasoline or paint or plumbing.

86
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:52,580
Uh, it can exist in most spheres in terms of medium.

87
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:57,080
It's present in soil, water, air.

88
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:08,600
We talked about how one environmental pathway, the uses we've already discussed here, uh, toxic mechanisms.

89
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:16,250
It's primarily impacting the neurological system, both through the central nervous system with the peripheral nervous system,

90
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,709
uh, its target organ, you know, the cause of the neurological effects, right?

91
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:28,280
That would be, uh, the brain, however, uh, it accumulates in the body, right?

92
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:31,490
So, and still stored in bone area.

93
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:39,410
So even after a dose has been received and we're no longer exposed to the toxic effects,

94
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:46,580
mechanistically can continue to occur in the body as that let it slowly released from bone marrow into the blood.

95
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:53,510
Because of this, you know, in contrast to the methane, we would consider its time course to be chronic, right?

96
00:10:53,540 --> 00:11:00,070
Because of its ability to accumulate. It has, in this sense, a long pathway.

97
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:06,650
Uh, Professor Neitzel kind of introduced the concept of a half life, right, when he's talking about radioactive decay.

98
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:14,930
There's a slide coming up where we'll talk through biological heart, uh, environmental properties.

99
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:21,709
It's persistent, it's ubiquitous in the environment, uh, physical chemical properties, in contrast to methane,

100
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:32,930
which primarily is the gas lead we usually find as a solid or perhaps as a small particle in the air, it's generally insoluble in water.

101
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:39,040
Uh, it's again, not volatile as existing as a solid at room temperature.

102
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:46,100
All right, let's go ahead now and look at how we might classify chemical exposures by source.

103
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:56,390
So in this case, we're looking at natural versus synthetic, which also means in beginning of means resulting from human activity.

104
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:13,310
Uh, we would find these, uh, in food, in water, in the atmosphere, uh, in terms of natural sources of chemicals, uh, one that's emitted from trees.

105
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:17,030
Uh, there's a class of compounds called turbines.

106
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:24,350
One specifically is painting an image over here released from pine trees.

107
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:35,719
More specifically, uh, is a primary pollutant that contributes to, uh, both o is troposphere goes on formation as well as secondary aerosols.

108
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:46,310
So again, forming small particles in the air just coming from naturally emitted pollutants, naturally chemicals, uh, different types of fungi.

109
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:59,720
Uh, I have here the example of aflatoxin and looking at the image up here on the top, these are peanuts still in show with a mold growing on them.

110
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:03,560
Uh, quick to don't eat moldy peanuts.

111
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:15,020
Uh, the reason is, uh, that aflatoxin is one of the most naturally occurring, most toxic, naturally occurring compost.

112
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:30,890
And so, and this is what is present in those moldy peanuts, uh, in terms of bacteria or endotoxin we also talked about, right, uh, poison.

113
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:33,830
It's like insects, spiders, bees. Right?

114
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:42,560
They can kind of inject as part of their bite some sort of chemical, uh, farm animals could actually be a source.

115
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:46,910
I think that they have something. A cow and a cow.

116
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,490
Yeah, here they are. That's why there was a picture of the cows here.

117
00:13:49,970 --> 00:14:05,210
Uh, they are a natural source of methane as part of the digestive process about they emit large quantities of methane, uh, terrestrial processes.

118
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:14,210
We've talked already about kind of forest fires, volcanoes, dust storms that can kick up all of.

119
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:18,700
Of different chemicals definitely into the air and for these specific.

120
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:32,330
She? And then, of course, if we switch that and look at classifying by anthropogenic sources, there are so many to name, um,

121
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:44,740
so many industrial processes, consumer products that are produced purposely, processes that involve mining and smelting.

122
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:53,530
This is a huge source of much of the metal pollution that's emitted into our environment.

123
00:14:54,940 --> 00:15:00,220
There was, I think in the previous slide, there was a reference to batteries with regards to the lead.

124
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:11,290
This is actually one of the challenges that's going to need to be addressed and solved going forward with this move to electronic vehicles.

125
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:19,420
So by getting rid of the combustion engines, we're no longer going to be emitting all of the contaminants,

126
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:23,650
especially greenhouse gases that are present when gasoline is burned.

127
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:28,150
Right. The electric vehicles aren't going to have that emission associated with them.

128
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:31,330
However, they use big batteries. Right.

129
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:39,280
This is what clarifies the range of the vehicle, how big and what the capacity of that battery is.

130
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:46,930
Batteries are made up of various metals and this is how they actually serve as a source of energy.

131
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:53,380
So there is a very quickly increasing mining industry.

132
00:15:54,010 --> 00:16:00,639
And then in order to purify the metals that are mined smelting process, which is basically burning wood,

133
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:07,520
you get rid of the contaminants and are left with a more pure metal to use to make the batteries.

134
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:11,590
And so there is a huge emission related with this process.

135
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:16,200
We already talked about burning fuels. Coal is a big one.

136
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:20,650
Yeah. Question Yes. So go back to the last slide.

137
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:25,720
Sure. Why would antibiotics be considered natural like in farm animals?

138
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:29,320
Yeah, so that's a good question. And I think I skipped over that one.

139
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:37,239
As an example, I talked about the methane, which, you know, the digestive process is absolutely, um, natural.

140
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:41,080
In this case, it might be a natural source.

141
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:47,370
That's the vector. But yeah, the reason that antibiotics is in there, we can also consider like growth hormones, right?

142
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:54,850
The things that are purposely injected into domestic animals, cows, chickens, etc.

143
00:16:55,330 --> 00:17:03,820
Um, when we ingest those, right, as, as a food source, we are then able to be exposed to those,

144
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:09,700
those hormones, those antibiotics and more broadly introduced into the environment as well.

145
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:15,670
But yeah, and this is where it gets a little bit unclear.

146
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:21,010
Do you call that a natural source or do you call that, you know, a source from human activity?

147
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:28,210
Certainly, it doesn't exist in the case of the antibiotics and the hormones without, you know, human activity.

148
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:32,920
But the vector ends up being otherwise a natural farm animal.

149
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:37,240
Good question and thanks for that opportunity to clarify that.

150
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:42,130
Any other questions? I know we're moving through these pretty quickly.

151
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,520
Feel free to stop me at any point. So yeah.

152
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:53,430
So just to finish up in terms of examples here, numerous, uh,

153
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:59,500
contaminants emitted as part of the combustion of coal, primarily for electricity production,

154
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:08,080
but so many of the consumer products that contain various metals, there's a phthalates,

155
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:14,440
parabens, etc. We'll have electro later in the closet, specifically around consumer products.

156
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:23,410
If we look at by medium and really focusing in on a roots of exposure,

157
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:30,250
we might classify chemicals by those that we are primarily exposed through ingestion.

158
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:34,660
Right. So anything present in food is going to be a focus here.

159
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:40,180
We've talked a little bit about mercury. Right. Mercury, contamination, bioaccumulation.

160
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:46,180
That's one of our primary problems of exposure is through ingesting mercury that's present in fish.

161
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:56,920
We just talked about meat products that they've they've had antibiotics added and they've had growth hormones added ingestion as a result of exposure.

162
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:06,700
And then even much of the produce, uh, fruits and vegetables and so forth that have pesticides acquired during their growth.

163
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:10,640
Uh, and then there are residues of that pesticide.

164
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:15,370
So, so through our ingestion of that produce is another way that we might be exposed.

165
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:23,110
We could classify chemicals right by hey, these are the what? These are ones that are basically food borne routes of exposure.

166
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:32,980
Uh, there might be others that are specific to water right through either ingestion or the drinking water purposely,

167
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:41,140
or perhaps bathing by coming into contact. Water could be a medium air, the term air pollutants.

168
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:45,580
Absolutely right. There's this class of pollutants that are primarily a concern in the air.

169
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:52,690
We come into contact with them on our skin and might not cause so much grief, but it's the fact that we're actually inhaling them.

170
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:57,459
Right. And those pollutants, even at a very low level, are coming into contact with our lung.

171
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:05,800
The linings creates big problems. And then, yes, there are some specific to the soil house dust.

172
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:10,180
We might look at skin contact as a way to classify some of those compounds.

173
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:27,610
This is just giving additional examples here of various pesticides, herbicides, uh, processes around dyes, adhesives, various solvents, etc.

174
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:38,949
And then by use and this is an important concept, uh, that they're going to go a little bit beyond just simply chemical exposures,

175
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:42,040
but it's a good time to introduce it and begin to address it.

176
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:48,900
Is the differentiation between the terms toxicity and hazard, right.

177
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:54,160
And there are there's a clear distinction. I want to make sure that we are on the same page going forward with this.

178
00:20:55,740 --> 00:21:06,690
So something might be considered a toxic chemical may be considered toxic, and it's considered based on an intrinsic property of that chemical.

179
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:19,080
So the chemicals evaluated with respect to like an organism or a site within an organism and the timeframe over which that toxic effect,

180
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:27,600
that person that that's like this is without looking at whether we're in contact with that chemical or not,

181
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:32,400
we can classify the chemical as being toxic and having toxicity.

182
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:38,310
It's another step for that chemical to be considered a hazard.

183
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:44,999
And this is where we begin to combine the presence of it existing in an environmental

184
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:51,030
medium or present in an exposure pathway and us coming into contact with it.

185
00:21:51,960 --> 00:22:01,230
So a hazard ends up being a function of both the toxicity as well as the nature and intensity of an actual exposure.

186
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:13,080
So for example, a highly toxic material can represent a low hazard and there's little or no potential for.

187
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:20,790
Is that is that resonating? Anybody have any kind of clarifying questions around that concept?

188
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:28,330
Okay. Yeah.

189
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:35,570
So there are so many uses. Uh, a lot of these are purposeful within the occupational setting, within the workplace, right?

190
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:41,780
There are processes where people's jobs involve doing the same thing over and over again.

191
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:48,440
So the process to move the product from point A to point B follows an application of this.

192
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:53,149
And the person is like in the picture here I was spraying something.

193
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:55,850
So this would be an example of chemicals by use, right?

194
00:22:56,150 --> 00:23:05,540
And oftentimes it's anthropogenic, they're synthetic and they're part of industrial processing and manufacturing of products.

195
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:12,260
Some of these might include grinding, spraying, eating, etc.

196
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:24,490
Um. Moving on to classifying chemicals by mechanism of action.

197
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:34,360
So we might classify compounds or chemicals in a category.

198
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:37,840
We might refer to them as those that are coal and asteroids inhibitors.

199
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:49,300
For example, we talked about methane, right? That primary toxicity and hazard is as a chemical that's fixing it.

200
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:59,529
So there are a group of chemicals that are considered chemicals besides those that might be irritants, those that might be neurotoxic.

201
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:05,990
And we talked about mood mercury examples of those and those that might be carcinogens.

202
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:13,090
Right. Hundreds if not more compounds that are classified as being carcinogenic.

203
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:21,550
So that's one way that chemical exposure is another way that chemical exposures can be classified as through their mechanism of action.

204
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:27,850
And then similarly, once we start looking at target organs within the body,

205
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:37,120
there are specific compounds that are hazardous to our lungs and that our health officials place certain ones to our liver,

206
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:40,420
those reproductive organs, etc.

207
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:57,190
Talking about those that are classified by their environmental properties as well as those by their physicochemical properties.

208
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:08,960
So in terms of environmental properties, there are a number when we just look at the atmosphere.

209
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,410
Right. There's there's so much going on here.

210
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:25,010
It's basically broken down by those that are somehow emitted or formed in the atmosphere that are directly a hazard to us as people,

211
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:29,400
or that can directly impact the environment.

212
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:36,320
More broadly, there's others that are more indirect, like greenhouse gases.

213
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:40,459
There are many things emitted at the concentration.

214
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:44,900
Presence in the atmosphere aren't really posing a direct threat to our health.

215
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:55,790
It's very much a downstream impact, right, in terms of its capacity as a greenhouse gas to over time warm the earth and cause

216
00:25:55,790 --> 00:26:01,010
lots of other downstream impacts that can directly pose a threat to our health.

217
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:09,799
There's a class of chemicals referred to as persistent organic pollutants, things like DDT,

218
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:15,290
dioxins, pharmaceutical byproducts that are released into the environment.

219
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:20,420
We've talked about heavy metals, greenhouse gases.

220
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:24,620
We used methane as an example. CO2 is another big one.

221
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,010
Chemicals that produce ozone.

222
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:31,999
And again, this is there used to be a pamphlet, I don't know,

223
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:39,080
back in like the seventies or eighties or something and said, ozone, good, up high, bad, down low or something like that.

224
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:46,440
And so where we are, where we reside and where we breathe air at the surface of the earth, we're in the layer of the atmosphere called the truth.

225
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:50,480
And this is where ozone can be produced.

226
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:59,330
And that's where we don't live is a long year, which is well documented to cause numerous adverse impacts on our health.

227
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:05,210
Interestingly, and we'll talk more when we talk specifically about air pollution later in the semester.

228
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:11,690
Ozone is not one of these pollutants that is emitted directly from its source.

229
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:17,840
It doesn't come out of a traditional smokestack. It doesn't come out of a car tailpipe.

230
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:25,280
It is formed through chemical reaction in the air and other precursor emissions.

231
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:32,360
So the two primary ones are nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds.

232
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:43,730
These two are directly emitted from smokestacks and they are directly emitted from car tailpipes in reference to the piney and even a natural source.

233
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,469
Trees emit some of these volatile organic compounds that can contribute to the

234
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:53,750
atmospheric chemical reactions that take place and form ozone in the troposphere.

235
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:59,300
In contrast, we have ozone depletion.

236
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:04,580
So this is referring to ozone that is naturally present in the stratosphere.

237
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:12,080
So this is above where we even fly in an airplane in terms of heat in the atmosphere

238
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:21,080
and ozone that high up actually absorbs harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun.

239
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:24,920
It would otherwise be reaching us on the surface of the earth.

240
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:30,940
So in that way, the ozone layer that exists in the stratosphere is protecting us.

241
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:35,480
It's protecting much of the environment. And unfortunately,

242
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:46,129
there are chemicals that we have manufactured and released into the environment that end up being pretty safe at low levels at the surface,

243
00:28:46,130 --> 00:29:01,460
the relatively inert things like chlorofluorocarbons that for a long time have been used as refrigerants in cars and home cooling units and so forth.

244
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:07,160
And even if they leak out, they're not a risk to us here at the surface.

245
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:18,200
But what we've learned over decades is that those leaked chlorofluorocarbons do make their way because they're inert up into the stratosphere.

246
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:27,530
Once they hit a certain height, they're being hit by, uh, of a light at different wavelengths that don't reach the surface of the earth.

247
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:36,320
So when those chlorofluorocarbons are hit by a specific wavelength of light in the stratosphere, they're no longer inert.

248
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:45,310
They react, they break down. And the chlorine, it's part of the chlorofluorocarbons compound.

249
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:56,270
And so the chlorine is able to interact in the ozone chemistry in the stratosphere and basically converts ozone to oxygen.

250
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:02,860
So it depletes the ozone layer at the. Stratosphere. And then acid rain producers.

251
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:07,640
It's kind of another classification of atmospheric chemicals.

252
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:20,570
So sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, again, these are big emissions that come from the burning of fossil fuels that then contribute downwind.

253
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:28,730
They form nitrate and sulfate particles and acid gases that then can be easily removed through precipitation.

254
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:35,210
This is the concept of acid rain that acidify is adversely.

255
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:47,150
And then talking about classifying chemical and possible exposures by physical chemical properties.

256
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:52,240
So we might be concerned primarily with gases, great papers.

257
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:57,860
These tend to be ones that we're concerned about through an inhalation route of exposure.

258
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:08,030
Right. We have talked about aerosols already, those that are present in water, depending on their physical chemical properties,

259
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:14,390
if they're dissolved in the water versus if they're not dictates how easily it is

260
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:20,210
due to filter or kind of clean the water through a water treatment processes,

261
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:27,690
whether they're actually bioavailable or not. More in general, just solubility.

262
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:35,480
And we talked about, you know, toxicity rate, talked about radioactivity and then the matrix.

263
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:39,320
Right. What's what's the piece? What is the acid level?

264
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:41,180
What's the dynamic strength?

265
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:51,860
And then other factors that dictate how hazardous the chemical might be or things as simple as relative humidity and temperature.

266
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:59,420
So there are there are a class of chemicals that at ambient conditions are considered semi volatile,

267
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:07,580
which means that it's highly dependent on the atmospheric temperature, whether they exist as a solid or exist as a gas.

268
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:19,910
So in the winter, we may not see much of a certain chemical existing in a gaseous form versus in the summertime when that temperature is higher,

269
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:24,050
that that compound is not volatile and can exist as a gas.

270
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:35,290
Oh, no. What happened to my slide? Hopefully whatever you download, it doesn't work like that.

271
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:42,770
And the PowerPoint file is probably like a mac conversion issue or something going from Mac typically.

272
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:47,530
My apologies. I will double check it actually.

273
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:50,710
Can someone confirm whether the file is you download it?

274
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:54,670
Okay. Good. It looks like that for me. It looks like that for you.

275
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:59,000
Great. I have no idea. What can I do?

276
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:03,370
I'll convert the PowerPoint into a PDA and make sure it looks good.

277
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:07,390
And I can post that as an additional file access for today's slides.

278
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:16,299
But just to go through the concept of biological pathway and the equation is not complicated.

279
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:22,840
So to talk through here, even with the whole equation, shouldn't be too bad.

280
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:31,360
So Rick talked about this and I still talked about the concept of Half-Life with radioactivity,

281
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:39,580
radioactive decay, how long it takes, an element or half of it to decay.

282
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:49,030
Right. I can't remember what the exact numbers were, but, you know, plutonium or something was like 28,000 years or millions of years.

283
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:52,569
I don't remember. Whereas others were much shorter, right?

284
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:58,000
Like radon, for example, the half life or how long it takes for half of it to decay.

285
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:07,720
So the concept of half life or biological have the same equation, the similar concept, but a little bit different application.

286
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:13,780
So we've been exposed to a chemical. We received a dose of a chemical.

287
00:34:14,410 --> 00:34:19,930
Once, let's say away, it's it's now in our bone marrow.

288
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:29,230
It's bio accumulated. How long does it take for half of that word to be removed from our body?

289
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:34,480
And so I will try to step through with with the general equation here.

290
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:44,820
On the left side, we have X, which is the amount of material remaining at a particular time since the exposure ended.

291
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:51,340
Right. So we kind of received the dose, uh, the exposure ends, uh, and that amount.

292
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:58,180
And I can specifically to calculate the amount of time where half of it is remaining as a function

293
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:07,540
of that initial body burden and a first order of elimination rate constant with units of per hour.

294
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:15,430
So, uh, we're exposed to the lead, and in this example, uh, it accumulates in our body.

295
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:25,330
The exposure ceases, we're no longer exposed, and now our body is working to get rid of that weight, and it takes a certain amount of time.

296
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:28,840
So we refer to the biological pathway of lead.

297
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:33,520
It's the amount of time for half of that dose to be removed.

298
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:42,130
I'm going to contrast that really quickly with, uh, with ozone right where you're saying my goal was not gas in the atmosphere.

299
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:46,720
It's highly reactive. We breathe it in, we inhale it.

300
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:51,340
It's an irritant. Causes problems in our lungs over a very short timeframe.

301
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:58,150
Right. Kids with asthma, for example, it can exacerbate their asthma within minutes to hours.

302
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:06,280
Very short term considerations. But because it's reactive, even though it causes an adverse impact on our health,

303
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:11,080
it's that ozone breaks down very quickly and it no longer exists in our body.

304
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:21,600
So if we were to calculate a half halfway ozone gas, it would be very short in comparison to calculating halfway or something like that.

305
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:27,580
It would be much longer. It's also the rationale for how, uh,

306
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:37,990
air quality standards are established as having an understanding of the nature of those exposures with relation to the biological high point.

307
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:44,680
So there are ozone standards or levels of ozone that exist in the atmosphere for one hour.

308
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:50,799
The averaging time is one hour because we know that all it takes is a high level over

309
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:56,350
a very short time period to have an adverse impact on our health that is different.

310
00:36:57,610 --> 00:37:02,080
We might be exposed to lower levels of lead in the atmosphere,

311
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:07,840
but because the President is present in new and ubiquitous and we're kind of

312
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:15,280
chronically exposed all of the time that you accumulate and it has a long way.

313
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:21,000
Therefore, the averaging times that the standards are set upon tend to be longer.

314
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:26,740
So it's something like a three month average or less in the atmosphere compared to science.

315
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:34,780
Any questions? Yes. My apologies if you already stated this, but is the black box supposed to be?

316
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:43,620
The black box appears to be like, is it X equals X, not the negative?

317
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:52,440
I believe so. Can somebody who can I just have to answer?

318
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:56,400
Yes. Yeah, I understand.

319
00:37:56,870 --> 00:38:00,060
I that's my assumption. And thanks, Kate, for confirming it.

320
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:05,160
Perhaps the actor. But I will.

321
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:10,830
I'll at least of this slide, I'll put it into a PDF and have the same information.

322
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:22,230
Any other question? I think. One more slide before we jump to the video, but I'll pause and see if there are questions.

323
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,680
So yeah, I think actually the example on this slide is what I just kind of basically went through

324
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:35,009
in the comparison between examples of land versus ocean is that with chemicals,

325
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:36,690
with long pathways,

326
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:49,260
there's a tendency for that chemical write upon repeated or chronic exposure to accumulate in our bodies and that our long term average exposure is

327
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:59,880
more relevant right from an exposure assessment perspective and in terms of our ability to indicate risk of what types of adverse effects might occur.

328
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:01,210
And then, you know,

329
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:13,530
contrasting that a compound with a short half life that doesn't really accumulate in the body but has its effects adequately metabolized or otherwise

330
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:23,180
eliminated within our bodies because that it's short term changes to those concentrations that are what's relevant to the potential toxic effects.

331
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:29,910
And so short term measurements of exposure, we want to be very important to that.

332
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:37,230
Okay. So at this point, I'm going to try to pull up a bit here, but before we do that,

333
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:44,970
are there other other questions around these different approaches to classifying chemical exposures?

334
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:52,239
If we go back to that equation that we can't we can't see.

335
00:39:52,240 --> 00:40:00,790
And again, what is this? No, it's okay. I just I just want to make sure I understand the e part, like the elimination rate is dependent on,

336
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:10,170
like if your body can metabolize something or not, right? Not like it's obviously different than the rate external to the body in terms of yeah.

337
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:16,330
So this is specific to inside our body eliminating within our body.

338
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:20,380
So without looking at the equation, maybe just like doing this in words,

339
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:28,240
the half line is a function of how much we were the dose that we received through that exposure

340
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:36,160
and that first order elimination rate constant that's specific to each independent chemical.

341
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:46,150
So that's kind of the takeaway. If you conceptually understand that, I can promise you for the exam that's still a few weeks away.

342
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:56,770
I will not say calculate the biological halfway of understanding the concept of biological,

343
00:40:56,770 --> 00:41:03,760
happily knowing where the relevance of should standards be.

344
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:10,360
We do exposure assessment over long averaging times, or should we do that over short averaging times?

345
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:19,060
Right? Understanding the concept of what this means and how it applies to our ability to assess exposures or impact on health.

346
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:27,309
Yes, I know some of the stories themselves.

347
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:31,720
Insight into people tend to have issues once they lose weight.

348
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:43,079
Is is let's say in that, like many of you were exposed to it, I see a process which is going on there.

349
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:47,950
I was breaking. Everybody was getting lower. Would you then start to see.

350
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:56,640
So, uh, good question. Let me try to rephrase it to make sure I'm capturing it correctly.

351
00:41:57,540 --> 00:42:03,570
So we know that lead, uh, accumulates in our bone marrow.

352
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:16,469
Are there preexisting conditions or later developed conditions that could affect how quickly that is released systemically through our body?

353
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:25,450
That would it would result in an exposure to other organisms and also affect potentially how quickly.

354
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:29,910
Is that a fair rephrasing of your question?

355
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,430
Yeah. Yeah. So the answer is yes.

356
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:40,930
So of course, and this kind of gets back to and we'll talk a little bit more in this class, but we don't get into it too much.

357
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:45,510
This is really where we are, at least in terms of the curriculum here in environmental sciences.

358
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:53,760
That's where the hand-off occurs, uh, to the EPA testing, so to classes, which is the essentials of toxicology would talk some more about this.

359
00:42:54,360 --> 00:43:03,600
But yes, life stage is a great example of another, uh, kind of a vulnerability or susceptibility that comes into play here.

360
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:08,130
So we know if something is toxic, we can classify it, right?

361
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:16,890
We can take a step further and say it's a hazard because people are being exposed to it, they're receiving a dose.

362
00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:22,800
But yes, the actual impact on health, there is a number of different factors,

363
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:29,910
but one of which is preexisting conditions in itself is acceptability factor.

364
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:36,660
I may mention late stage, if we're talking about infants versus elderly folks versus young, healthy adults,

365
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:46,470
there are very there are differences that impact whether the actual outcome is something that doesn't answer your question.

366
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:50,250
Okay. These are great questions, by the way.

367
00:43:50,250 --> 00:44:01,740
Thank you. And I encourage you to interrupt me like you are doing now to seek clarification on the slide,

368
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:05,580
not material, especially when the equations don't look the way they're supposed to.

369
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:11,760
Any others? This.

370
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,570
So let's see another time.

371
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:21,860
I'm going to pull up TEDTalk talk here.

372
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:28,790
We haven't tested the technology in the room yet, but glad your first try.

373
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:49,980
My grandmother gave me a blanket and for a toothache I started using to cope with anxiety and depression.

374
00:44:50,730 --> 00:45:20,520
I want to give me a volume. How's that for volume?

375
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:27,640
Okay. All right. Was it? No, not at all.

376
00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:36,900
So, really quick introduction. So this is a TED Talk by Dr. Arlene Vaughn.

377
00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:50,040
And she is for decades now, one of the leading experts on a classic classification of chemicals, chemical exposures specific to flame retardants.

378
00:45:51,120 --> 00:46:03,779
Right. And so things that exist all over the place, just in this room, all of the electronic devices that we have, the carpet, furniture, the walls,

379
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:05,910
the ceiling tiles, etc.,

380
00:46:06,270 --> 00:46:19,500
are all designed to meet specific codes of construction standards and regulations all around being resistant to flame and fire.

381
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:25,590
And so I want we can talk more about the issue at the end of the video.

382
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:30,360
That's a little bit of an introduction. It's about 15 minutes long.

383
00:46:30,870 --> 00:46:36,940
I'll go ahead and play it. We can watch it and then, yeah, we'll have a few minutes to discuss things.

384
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:41,520
But anyway, kind of in an application of this, this chemical classification.

385
00:46:55,700 --> 00:47:02,120
It's also 12 years old so that I know we can update some of the things that have occurred.

386
00:47:02,450 --> 00:47:17,760
The science is still absolutely relevant. Now my client, executive director Thomas Institute in California.

387
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:22,460
And I need to be remembered for the plastic pollution pollution.

388
00:47:23,310 --> 00:47:38,490
And I want to do something that's not so well being that is toxic flame retardants

389
00:47:38,490 --> 00:47:46,620
used in plastics in our furniture and electronics and other common everyday products.

390
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:51,630
But the good news is this is a problem we can solve.

391
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:58,800
So let me ask you, how many of you pay for your shampoos?

392
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:06,930
Someone is making sure the fact that there's no cameras are causing hazardous chemicals in those products.

393
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:10,240
Somebody thinks somebody who's paying attention to me.

394
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:15,790
Not very, very knowledgeable audience. And how many things.

395
00:48:16,050 --> 00:48:24,930
There can be chemicals in everyday products that are known as serious harm, known as the ability to do anything about it.

396
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:32,470
You are very knowledgeable and you write the sad fact that we have sewage,

397
00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:40,109
drugs and pesticides unregulated before they go into products and a lot of other chemicals.

398
00:48:40,110 --> 00:48:47,820
There's no regulation. So we know that there are serious problems with the chemicals and they are consumer products.

399
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:58,710
So I'm as I said, you know, halogens, organic carbon halogens and bromine forming chlorine iodide,

400
00:48:59,370 --> 00:49:05,970
the bond between carbon and the halogens in very, very strong, very long minutes.

401
00:49:06,370 --> 00:49:13,080
So our new halogens come into our bodies and stay for weeks, months and years the rest of our lives.

402
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:30,810
And they can cause some problems. In example, other halogen it is, and I consider this DDT wallpaper, the pesticide,

403
00:49:31,050 --> 00:49:37,200
DDT, the halogen and number of pesticides like DDT that were banned in the eighties.

404
00:49:38,130 --> 00:49:45,510
This mother thinks she's doing good for her daughter and putting DDT wallpaper in the nursery, protecting her.

405
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:48,470
He knows that. Would she does it now?

406
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:58,620
Using new research herself from UC Berkeley with young girls exposed to high levels of these five times greater risk of breast cancer.

407
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:04,000
These girls were exposed in the fifties and sixties.

408
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:13,050
Decades later, we have this research result in the same chemicals and we have DDT in your garden

409
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:20,399
or halogen signs or the abandoned halogen type in terms their chemical cousins.

410
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:25,650
In some cases the same pesticides even returns are the same molecules.

411
00:50:26,430 --> 00:50:33,360
So I find interesting flame retardants that some of these we've heard about, some of which are called broken.

412
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:39,580
And it's being used in my kids pajamas in those days, 5 to 10% of weight.

413
00:50:39,610 --> 00:50:47,519
And John was was this organic halogen flame retardant which has to be found within you to change.

414
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:51,840
The living organism was likely to cause cancer.

415
00:50:51,990 --> 00:50:56,309
We found in child number one it was pajamas, which wasn't so easy.

416
00:50:56,310 --> 00:51:02,340
Put her down the next morning, would break down products in her urine.

417
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:07,110
That means the chemicals come into our bodies from our clothing.

418
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:10,470
Just that we were eating, that there was no regulations.

419
00:51:11,970 --> 00:51:16,230
So being a scientist, we wrote a paper in science article.

420
00:51:16,650 --> 00:51:22,110
We called for him to stop the use of in kids pajamas.

421
00:51:22,770 --> 00:51:26,040
And that was January 1977.

422
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:29,430
Three months later, the Consumer Product Safety Commission.

423
00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:37,259
Fancy dress. So many of you were kids in the seventies.

424
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:41,450
Maybe some of you were. You only were just getting married to some good deal.

425
00:51:42,330 --> 00:51:45,360
So when Robert ended, just got day.

426
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:52,710
And what do you think the substitute words we always like to keep are industrial processes similar to substitute recording.

427
00:51:53,970 --> 00:52:00,780
So we did more studies for an interesting thing. We originally wrote another paper that was also removed from kids pajamas.

428
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:16,180
But sad news in Saturday morning and traces back out furniture and found baby products at levels up to 10% of the way through many times.

429
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:25,980
And why is that? Because of a unique California furniture firm ability standard contract for 117.

430
00:52:26,670 --> 00:52:34,860
And I ask you to remember that when you go home under your chair, get that the center portion of your couch and you make you notice,

431
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:42,880
like the one on the slide that your couch in your chair complies with that.

432
00:52:43,590 --> 00:52:48,720
And that means it's very likely to be treated with an organic halogen flame retardant.

433
00:52:49,590 --> 00:52:52,590
So what are the health problems with these chemicals?

434
00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:56,100
Well, there's a whole industry assigned to study chemicals.

435
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:01,110
Hundreds of scientists get together in meetings, present peer reviewed papers.

436
00:53:01,710 --> 00:53:07,710
And what they studies with these chemicals are anything of substance.

437
00:53:08,490 --> 00:53:14,610
They cause scrambling brain development, hyperactivity, neurological impairments.

438
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:26,550
They're reproductive toxins in both males and females and males have lower sperm counts of more than 5000 takes longer to get pregnant.

439
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:32,730
They inject fiber and they cause cancer. This is in many, many hundreds of animal studies.

440
00:53:33,390 --> 00:53:38,400
And now, sadly, not in the last couple of years, we're finding human studies with the same result.

441
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:44,849
And it's pretty unusual to find human health results on chemicals that are industrial.

442
00:53:44,850 --> 00:53:54,989
We are exposed to so many because we move around were usually just industrial chemicals like disgust is where we can find health results because

443
00:53:54,990 --> 00:54:03,810
these flame retardants were used in our furniture since the standard was passed in the seventies and use of levels of 5% of the way to the forms,

444
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:09,500
we can have pounds of these organic halogen flame returns in our homes.

445
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:14,400
We are finding these in humans, not surprisingly, very similar results.

446
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:20,850
So in this study, UC Berkeley showed that women with higher levels think twice as as become pregnant.

447
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:29,160
Columbia University study showed that infants at birth having higher levels of 4 to 6 months IQ points at age four.

448
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:41,470
So. So how did the chemicals get into less volatile?

449
00:54:41,530 --> 00:54:45,490
They migrate out of products. They're heavy. They drop into dust.

450
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:57,760
We have dust that our hands may have French fry that go into our bodies and they stay with us so that Lovings may stay in our state investment.

451
00:54:58,630 --> 00:55:03,880
Sadly, a number of studies show that children have 3 to 4 times the level of their

452
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:07,600
mothers because they get the same level as their mother through the placenta.

453
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:09,700
They get the second dose.

454
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:21,069
American Express has record levels of same chance, and then toddlers with hand-to-mouth behavior get more sun retardants in their bodies.

455
00:55:21,070 --> 00:55:25,000
And this is the time of reproductive and brain development.

456
00:55:25,170 --> 00:55:35,530
Can you not? 100%. You have the highest levels, and that's because they're in the dust and they have levels in the year 2500.

457
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:41,800
So that's my cat. Midnight and midnight went from being a 15 to 5.

458
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:45,330
Yeah. Did that diagnose Piper thyroid disease.

459
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:48,610
That that disease never existed was never the virus.

460
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:51,730
I began to find thyroid disease and thought it was a chemical.

461
00:55:52,540 --> 00:55:56,780
And I thought, that's interesting. That flame returned.

462
00:55:56,830 --> 00:56:05,530
We have you know, we use 98% of the use was in mostly California and in North America,

463
00:56:05,530 --> 00:56:09,490
other places where furniture manufacturers followed the California standard.

464
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:15,640
Thought I wonder if we need to have because of the battery problems in mice, rats,

465
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:21,400
kestrels, frogs and tons of workers have higher incidence of moderate problems.

466
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:29,410
So we sent a sample of our house tests, midnight science and veterinary epidemiologist the other night.

467
00:56:30,010 --> 00:56:38,800
The results came on our house test and midnight people had the highest levels they ever measured in this toxic flame retardant.

468
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:47,380
And that was with an Illinois study. And we lived in California. So I checked my furniture and everything in my house was 5%.

469
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:52,180
So that's my couch. And we see things in the dumpster.

470
00:56:52,630 --> 00:57:04,210
But there is a way through studies that show cancer leaches out of our landfills and it just ends up in sewage treatment plants.

471
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:14,350
And the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration did a study looking for cancer around our host and found that everywhere there were cities,

472
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:19,690
there were high levels. And in 7 minutes and 5 hours, which is the bottom of the chain.

473
00:57:20,110 --> 00:57:23,330
So it builds up. Said 70 died down to this smallest.

474
00:57:23,470 --> 00:57:33,600
There's a large fish in bioaccumulation, so it comes to chemicals like cancer to one where there are high levels of the North Pole, to the South Pole.

475
00:57:33,790 --> 00:57:39,860
And then the furnace, when you look at the animals, you see and you have maybe an apples near the south,

476
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:47,240
polar bears you've been talking about 90% of this chemical was used in North America, primarily to be killed.

477
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:52,659
When you find you have no other way up, very high levels.

478
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:57,130
The highest ever recorded a marine mammals on the coast of California.

479
00:57:57,730 --> 00:58:06,390
A recent paper program had returned killer whales because their levels are so high killer resting on the flame retardants.

480
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:13,180
So is there a fire safety net? And the answer is no.

481
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:20,960
Can you believe that? So the graph on the left is you can hear some foam balloon out of one and the one.

482
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:25,510
Brad Right. At this point in time, it takes three more seconds.

483
00:58:25,630 --> 00:58:30,040
The flame retardant makes your foam through 3 seconds, you get three more seconds.

484
00:58:30,730 --> 00:58:35,379
But that inspired toxicity when you compare with them without flame retardants,

485
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:41,770
you get twice as much smoke, six times as much carbon monoxide, and 90 times as much.

486
00:58:41,770 --> 00:58:45,460
So what do you think kills you? Fire. You're in a hotel room.

487
00:58:46,030 --> 00:58:49,030
You open the door. The smoke, close the door.

488
00:58:50,290 --> 00:58:55,000
The carbon monoxide gets. So this is what we get for quitting punching in our furniture.

489
00:58:55,540 --> 00:59:00,369
So what? That's right. That's changed a lot. So since four years,

490
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:09,249
I have supported our group policy and supported legislation in Sacramento for a flammability standard that would provide more fires,

491
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:15,310
safety, flammability standards and fabric fabric that would not use toxic components.

492
00:59:15,940 --> 00:59:23,139
And the result was a marketing campaign, which maybe some of you remember full page ads in papers,

493
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:30,790
radio, TV, glossy mailers, all paid for by front group Californians for Fire Safety.

494
00:59:30,790 --> 00:59:34,060
Who are the three companies that manufacture materials?

495
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:41,290
Now, this might sound a little. But I don't seem discouraged because we've actually had many, many successes.

496
00:59:41,310 --> 00:59:50,130
It's only three companies that can change their business model with some policy, biometric result and other kinds of flame retardants.

497
00:59:51,030 --> 00:59:55,679
Some of our successes there is a similar flammability standard for pillows.

498
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:58,800
Nappies covers those memory foams we all love.

499
00:59:58,890 --> 01:00:01,370
All of those are going to have to. You can complain.

500
01:00:01,860 --> 01:00:11,400
But when we brought good science into the decision process at the last minute and then some a response there on stage.

501
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:23,280
Another important area is green building may not realize is the chance to make green building energy

502
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:29,070
innovation on plastic regulations that are treated with some of the most toxic flame retardants.

503
01:00:29,730 --> 01:00:33,990
And when we build, we know about this making choices.

504
01:00:35,130 --> 01:00:43,170
A friend in Berkeley, an architect who designed supposedly the greenest visitor center ever in this valley,

505
01:00:43,170 --> 01:00:49,080
and it was covered in polystyrene, which is a plastic information, one of the worst flame retardants.

506
01:00:49,590 --> 01:00:54,150
You heard about the problem and then he substituted mineral water, which is fine.

507
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:59,550
Solid ground for the plastic polystyrene that something visitor center subsidy.

508
01:01:01,110 --> 01:01:06,130
So now we're supposed to hear something new. I'm going to share with you something that nobody knows.

509
01:01:06,180 --> 01:01:14,310
It's a result of the new study we've done. We looked at 100 baby products, and the bad news is in 80 of them, you have toxic flow retardants.

510
01:01:15,090 --> 01:01:19,360
The nursing pillow with the organic cotton covers 10% for the.

511
01:01:20,310 --> 01:01:23,580
A third of these products are made in trees.

512
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:28,110
But with this information, parents can make different choices.

513
01:01:28,110 --> 01:01:31,889
On paper, it's going to be peer reviewed. It's going to come out in a few months.

514
01:01:31,890 --> 01:01:39,000
And we hope this will reach parents where the children's information rich parents, they'll demand saving products.

515
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:46,830
And I'm actually optimistic that children can be safe both in their pajamas and sitting on the couch.

516
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:53,250
So I think the toxic chemical problem is solvable with information.

517
01:01:53,250 --> 01:01:57,540
Consumers can make their own choices, builders and architects to make better choices.

518
01:01:57,900 --> 01:02:04,860
We can support new regulations that will give us more fire safety without toxicity.

519
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:12,510
And very important right now in DC we have legislation for chemical reform to give our

520
01:02:12,510 --> 01:02:17,970
government authorities to protect us not only from toxic flame retardant plastics,

521
01:02:18,390 --> 01:02:23,770
but from a whole range of toxic chemicals that are adversely impacting our health.

522
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:28,350
So I think this is a moment that we can succeed and we can have a healthier world.

523
01:02:28,530 --> 01:02:43,480
Thank you. All right.

524
01:02:44,110 --> 01:02:47,790
So let's see. So much to unpack there. Um.

525
01:02:49,050 --> 01:02:56,640
First off, I think I introduced myself on the first day of class as being interested in conducting

526
01:02:56,640 --> 01:03:03,450
research that builds into it the data collection to be able to address policy,

527
01:03:04,620 --> 01:03:10,830
improve regulations and standards and policy to reduce exposures.

528
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:16,770
And this is a perfect example of that in this situation.

529
01:03:16,770 --> 01:03:21,660
Right. Dr. Blum is conducting research that is very targeted.

530
01:03:21,810 --> 01:03:26,490
She's doing studies to directly inform an impact on policy.

531
01:03:27,450 --> 01:03:33,420
There's so much to unpack in this. One of them is that we're not going to do it in 10 minutes.

532
01:03:34,860 --> 01:03:42,030
Is that this is a shameless plug, actually. I teach a class, so I'm interested in research, but I'm also interested in teaching policy.

533
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:46,740
I teach a class in the winter semester. It's two credits. It's called Environmental Health and Policy.

534
01:03:47,430 --> 01:03:51,960
And as part of it, there are five case studies where students get to dig in.

535
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:56,010
This is actually one of them is it's flame retardants.

536
01:03:57,270 --> 01:04:03,899
And it's really interesting because, you know, from a health and safety perspective, the state of California.

537
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:07,230
And we're going to have some other examples of it later in the semester.

538
01:04:07,740 --> 01:04:09,690
It's highly progressive, right?

539
01:04:10,170 --> 01:04:18,840
Certainly a leader within the US, arguably a leader across the world in progressive policies to improve health and safety.

540
01:04:19,470 --> 01:04:24,960
And so as part of that, they can put this this flame standard, right.

541
01:04:25,290 --> 01:04:28,290
Flame resistance in consumer products.

542
01:04:29,010 --> 01:04:35,380
So the intention was good, but the ultimate impact and outcome was was not very good.

543
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:42,150
Right. Because it resulted in all of these products having these very high levels of these chemical flame retardants that

544
01:04:42,150 --> 01:04:47,940
have numerous adverse impacts on people that are easily exposed to them because they're in contact with them,

545
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:54,149
you know, every day. And in so many of the products that we use, because California is so large, right?

546
01:04:54,150 --> 01:05:01,260
It's like 40 million people. If you are a manufacturer and you're trying to streamline your processes,

547
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:09,540
it's it's not cost effective to make furniture or maybe products or whatever just to sell in California.

548
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:15,750
Right. It's more cost effective to just make all of your products that you distribute everywhere to meet that standard.

549
01:05:15,990 --> 01:05:26,410
So that's what happened. So it's not just in California, although folks in California have had the highest levels of exposure or that,

550
01:05:26,430 --> 01:05:31,680
you know, those decades of time compared to others around the world for sure.

551
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:38,940
An update to that. This was a 2010 video and I like to play it because it just hits on so many of the things that we just went

552
01:05:38,940 --> 01:05:45,870
through right in that small slide deck in terms of how we how we might classify chemicals and some of the schemes.

553
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:48,600
Since 2010,

554
01:05:48,630 --> 01:06:00,690
the state of California has modified that flame retardant technical bulletin so that there are protections in place for many products not all,

555
01:06:00,990 --> 01:06:07,500
but many. The issue is that it wasn't like a federal policy in the first place, right?

556
01:06:07,510 --> 01:06:14,370
It started with the state of California. But because of the way industry and manufacturers worked, it affected the whole country.

557
01:06:15,090 --> 01:06:20,040
And so it's being primarily managed at the state level. So California was the first to address it.

558
01:06:20,070 --> 01:06:28,220
I think Massachusetts. Massachusetts also came up with it with the new law banning flame retardants in many different products.

559
01:06:28,290 --> 01:06:36,630
Maybe just a year ago or so. There is pending legislation in other states, but also others where it's not the case.

560
01:06:36,780 --> 01:06:39,810
So from a policy perspective, it's a really interesting one to study.

561
01:06:40,260 --> 01:06:45,870
We often look at federal policies if this one is really managed at the state level.

562
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:54,810
And then, yeah, I'm just trying to recall some of the terms that we that we just talked about prior to watching the video that she just hits upon.

563
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:58,860
One of them, she talked about fat soluble chemicals.

564
01:06:59,730 --> 01:07:08,190
She talked about the class of compounds right there, these halogen compounds.

565
01:07:09,140 --> 01:07:13,770
And even though it's a it's a small class, it's present in everything.

566
01:07:13,770 --> 01:07:23,040
So the percent weight, like 5 to 10% of the weight of the product is just this chemical flame retardant.

567
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:26,460
That's ridiculous. That's a huge amount. Right.

568
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:36,000
Like with most environmental contaminants, we're talking about traces that over chronic exposure end up causing, you know, adverse impacts on health.

569
01:07:36,450 --> 01:07:41,950
These are massive amounts. Right, that are in everything that we do come into play.

570
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:46,049
We talked about life stage, right. And how this comes into it.

571
01:07:46,050 --> 01:07:49,920
So referencing events and shows. Right baby products.

572
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:57,240
So they have the lowest body mass and the highest exposure to all of the hand-to-mouth rate that was referenced.

573
01:07:59,190 --> 01:08:02,840
The story about her cat is crazy, right?

574
01:08:03,090 --> 01:08:11,100
But it makes perfect sense. So, you know, cats clean themselves by looking like almost nonstop anybody has a cat or doesn't want to get.

575
01:08:11,820 --> 01:08:17,760
So their exposure is super high. That is super high.

576
01:08:19,020 --> 01:08:24,690
I'm blanking on there are so many things I was trying to recall the dimensions that she kind of touched upon in the video,

577
01:08:25,290 --> 01:08:30,070
but with the few minutes that we have left. Reactions.

578
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:38,590
Comments. Questions. So I almost brought this for the in the news thing, but I ended up talking about the water.

579
01:08:39,550 --> 01:08:45,070
There was a there's a lawsuit in California right now that was being reported in the Los Angeles Times,

580
01:08:45,550 --> 01:08:50,890
because they're now replacing the chemicals with a layer of woven fiberglass.

581
01:08:50,890 --> 01:08:58,210
And that's and people are removing the covers and they're getting fiberglass from their mattresses and things like that.

582
01:08:58,320 --> 01:09:04,180
I just thought it was interesting that they and it said that they like California

583
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:08,350
passed like three different rounds of regulations banning the chemicals.

584
01:09:08,350 --> 01:09:13,150
So of course, manufacturers want to do something to still meet the standards, but.

585
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:19,990
Right. And that's a great, great point that Dr. Blum mentioned. Right. Is that this is the way that industry basically responds.

586
01:09:19,990 --> 01:09:27,459
Right. They're not going to go off and it's not cost effective and it's not easy to come up with

587
01:09:27,460 --> 01:09:33,130
a whole new conceptual or new approach to developing something that's returned to plant.

588
01:09:33,140 --> 01:09:37,780
So she mentioned that used to be the brominated tress that was banned.

589
01:09:37,900 --> 01:09:43,330
So industry developed a chlorinated trans right and it just kind of kicked the can further down the road.

590
01:09:43,780 --> 01:09:48,429
There's more studies. People are exposed, there are adverse. So right.

591
01:09:48,430 --> 01:09:54,309
So this is right. You're kind of relaying that that's it's interesting because it's like they've gone from like a chemical

592
01:09:54,310 --> 01:10:01,510
thing to like a physical issue because that's like a different a different form of a hazardous agent.

593
01:10:02,020 --> 01:10:15,940
Absolutely. She said that that these things will only catch on fire 3 seconds later and things that aren't treated with this.

594
01:10:16,240 --> 01:10:21,610
And that's assuming that they haven't found anything because nothing is truly flame retardant.

595
01:10:21,610 --> 01:10:28,030
Right. Like, if your house catches on fire, everything inside your house will be destroyed, regardless of what it's made of.

596
01:10:28,510 --> 01:10:35,320
So I'm just wondering if the the standard is kind of useless anyway.

597
01:10:35,710 --> 01:10:38,770
And then even if they wanted to have that standard,

598
01:10:38,770 --> 01:10:48,549
because California has a proclivity for fires and I would think that maybe you would want to pause the standard until you could pay

599
01:10:48,550 --> 01:10:59,020
people to figure out what material would significantly decrease the speed at which fires catch and aren't going to harm people.

600
01:10:59,230 --> 01:11:03,490
And it doesn't seem like this is doing that much in the first place. Think it's.

601
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:09,220
I don't. Yeah. Your house is still going to catch on fire. Yeah.

602
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:12,380
No, it's a it's a great observation. Thank you for that.

603
01:11:12,390 --> 01:11:15,400
And and Dr. Blum kind of alluded to that. Right.

604
01:11:15,420 --> 01:11:19,560
Although she was pretty sensitive, she didn't really go off on it on the concept.

605
01:11:19,950 --> 01:11:23,540
But she pointed it out briefly and she talked about the campaign right.

606
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:31,640
Against, uh, banning them that was put forth by, uh, the chemical industry that makes these products.

607
01:11:31,650 --> 01:11:37,290
Right. And so this is, this is getting a little bit off topic.

608
01:11:37,290 --> 01:11:40,980
It's really getting into the kind of the policy dynamics. So yeah. So back to your point.

609
01:11:41,370 --> 01:11:52,560
Uh, yes, it's absolutely true that the benefit of the presence of these flame retardant chemicals is minimal, if anything at all.

610
01:11:53,670 --> 01:12:00,630
Right. So it's, uh, perhaps a couple of seconds additional of resistance to flame.

611
01:12:01,260 --> 01:12:07,110
But then on the flip side, she referenced that from, from a different, uh, source.

612
01:12:07,110 --> 01:12:16,440
You might not be burning physically from the fire, but even so much more additional smoke and carbon monoxide.

613
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:20,459
It's generated by the burning flame retardant.

614
01:12:20,460 --> 01:12:26,910
Right. That's now within all of these products. Uh, is what's causing harm?

615
01:12:26,910 --> 01:12:30,540
It's not death, right? From. From the exposure perspective.

616
01:12:30,990 --> 01:12:36,270
So, yes, it's easily justifiable from a rational scientific viewpoint.

617
01:12:36,780 --> 01:12:41,780
Um, and then this is where, you know, policy is not so straightforward.

618
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:49,680
And no matter how much data, scientific data there is to inform it, there are other challenges and hurdles that are present.

619
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:58,950
And this is pretty common. Right? So the the candle resistant technical bulletin that was put into place back in the seventies that kicked off this,

620
01:12:58,950 --> 01:13:04,440
you know, this whole new industry of products being treated with flame retardants.

621
01:13:05,130 --> 01:13:13,500
It's now a big industry, right? There are big chemical companies manufacturing this stuff for the use that now are making a ton of money from

622
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:19,319
the process in response to a standard that was put into place that they probably had very little to do with it.

623
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:29,280
Now that it's in place right there, their ability to profit and make money is threatened by additional legislation that would actually,

624
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:34,680
you know, ban those chemicals in the process. And this is a pretty common challenge.

625
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:44,850
Dr. Blum also alluded to. She clarified specifically in this country, in the US, this is what happens.

626
01:13:45,510 --> 01:13:51,719
Chemicals are put into products and it's decades later that we find out there are harmful.

627
01:13:51,720 --> 01:14:01,080
This is not the way that it is all over the world. This is not the way that consumer products are regulated in the European Union, for example.

628
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:08,280
And we'll talk about that later in the semester when we talk specifically around standards and regulations.

629
01:14:09,030 --> 01:14:13,740
But it is it's a very frustrating approach, the way that things are managed here in the U.S.,

630
01:14:15,990 --> 01:14:26,010
the burden is basically placed on society to identify what's harmful right after an industry has already grown and made a ton of money.

631
01:14:26,010 --> 01:14:29,070
And now it's an uphill battle to try to walk it back.

632
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:38,030
We've got maybe one more minute. Any other any other questions or comments or just reflections on this particular case study?

633
01:14:45,990 --> 01:14:51,140
All right. Well, in addition to giving a 15 minute break and not having to listen to me, I hope that it was, you know,

634
01:14:51,150 --> 01:15:00,809
that you saw it as as kind of an example in an application for a different chemical plants to reconsider, is it not?

635
01:15:00,810 --> 01:15:03,600
Thanks so much for your attention. Have a good rest of your day.
