1
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:53,910
This is it's Nelly's teashop and we're the antonellis.

2
00:00:53,920 --> 00:01:01,270
We chose our Spark Cash Plus card from Capital One because we are an unlimited 2% cash back on every purchase and with no pre-set spending limit,

3
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:04,870
our purchasing power adapts to our business needs. What's in your wallet?

4
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:10,300
If you've never heard of a Zika virus before this year, you're not alone.

5
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:18,340
It was isolated from monkeys in 1947 in Uganda, in the Zika rainforest, and since then it really hasn't bothered humans much at all.

6
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:25,900
Until now, the Zika virus appeared in Brazil for the first time in 2015, and more than a million people have been infected since then.

7
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:33,820
Just to put that into perspective, the last largest outbreak happened in French Polynesia and it really only spread around to a couple hundred people.

8
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:40,090
80% of people with the virus don't have symptoms at all. The others have mild symptoms, including fever and a rash.

9
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:47,740
So here's why public health officials are concerned. Now we're learning when pregnant women contract Zika, they can pass it on to their fetuses.

10
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,040
And this, in turn, can cause terrible birth defects.

11
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,139
This is microcephaly. It's a birth defect that involves incomplete head and brain development.

12
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:01,360
So they look like they have very small heads. And what that means is they're basically mentally disabled.

13
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,730
They have a shorter life expectancy and it's just an absolutely devastating disease.

14
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:11,440
Microcephaly has multiple causes, but officials think it might also be linked to Zika.

15
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:16,719
That's why public health officials in Latin America and the Caribbean are cautioning women not to get pregnant.

16
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,040
Right now in the U.S.,

17
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:25,689
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention took a similar we extreme measure when they issued an unprecedented travel advisory,

18
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:35,620
telling women who are pregnant to avoid traveling to countries in Latin America where the virus is circulating that included their very own territory.

19
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:38,890
Puerto Rico Zika virus is carried by mosquitoes.

20
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:46,840
It might be transmitted through sex as well. And the type of mosquitoes that spread Zika live in warm areas all over the world, including the US.

21
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:53,320
The main vector for this disease is called the Aedes aegypti and it's mostly found along the southern U.S.

22
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:59,500
But there's some question about whether it's also carried by another mosquito called the AIDS albopictus,

23
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,590
and that has a much broader range right now.

24
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:07,959
There's no cure or treatment for Zika. They're working on vaccines, but that could take years.

25
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:14,290
So really the only way to protect yourself is to try not to get bitten by mosquitoes, which is difficult to do.

26
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:17,650
It's especially important that pregnant women are aware of the risk.

27
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:23,590
There needs to be a lot of awareness about the virus and about this potential for damage to the fetus later.

28
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:16,850
Yes. Our page. I just had a question about the jeans.

29
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,270
Oh, okay. What? What is it? I know.

30
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:25,939
Just because I've seen, like, three different, like, this time this year, like, just had my dog specifically.

31
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:28,990
So I was wondering, like, do they all belong to, like, that same genus?

32
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,270
Like, are they all. They could be potentially different.

33
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:39,229
So did I tell you all about how the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services they for their vector borne control district,

34
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:41,180
they have an app you can download.

35
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:50,209
And then if you find a check on your dog or yourself, you can see the picture of the tick and then add to their like AP database for them to analyze.

36
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:57,330
It'll also ask you like the location approximately in which the tick attach the benefit though with the dogs in particular,

37
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:07,100
the dog takes like a month. When you shine it, it it might it attaches to them, but it doesn't.

38
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:12,060
And it basically just falls off and dies. Right. But humans don't have that thing that.

39
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:18,150
Oh, yeah, I see the sound now. Yeah. Yeah. It was like I said, when I move in.

40
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:21,380
This is most of your recording. Okay, this is the mute button, so. Yeah, yeah.

41
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:26,400
Yeah, I did it when I did it just went off, so. Oh. Must have just been stuck or something.

42
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:29,940
Of course it works now that you're here, but I guess that's what you're here for.

43
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:33,420
Thank you. Okay, bye.

44
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:39,360
Alrighty. Where was I? Did he close that door for me?

45
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:52,410
Cool. All right. So in terms of the life cycle in particular, it is not as fast as mosquitoes, obviously.

46
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:54,180
So generally, you know,

47
00:17:54,180 --> 00:18:04,200
you have the eggs that are in the spring and then they become larva in the summer and then fall they become fold more like grown adult.

48
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,279
And then in the winter they still exist, but they might be more dormant.

49
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:14,970
And then it kind of goes through this whole cycle again. But again, if it's not as cold, like their ability to survive is is much better.

50
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:26,640
Lyme disease in particular, generally the symptoms is what they call this like super characteristic, expanding red rash, which is like a bull's eye.

51
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,610
I myself luckily have never been bit by a tick,

52
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:36,149
but it's more difficult to distinguish because I'm that person that gets a big reactions to even mosquito bites.

53
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:39,470
So I'll still get like a big welts and kind of a ring around it.

54
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:44,549
But most people get fever, headache and fatigue, so that is signature.

55
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:48,780
If you have a bull's eye mark and then you start to have influenza like symptoms.

56
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:55,749
But if untreated, it can lead to the loss of ability to move one or both sides of the face.

57
00:18:55,750 --> 00:19:01,229
So a kind of partial paralysis that makes it seem like you've had a stroke, but not yet.

58
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:06,810
You didn't joint pain, severe headaches with neck stiffness and then heart palpitations.

59
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:16,229
So as I mentioned, there have been many undiagnosed cases of Lyme disease in particular because the red rash doesn't stay around forever.

60
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:22,770
It's only a short period of time. And then people have this chronic like joint pain, neck stiffness, fatigue,

61
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:29,190
and then they frequently people accidentally get diagnosed instead with fibromyalgia

62
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:35,490
or like chronic fatigue syndrome and some kind of like undiagnosed characteristics.

63
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:40,080
And then they figure out, Oh, okay, I had a Lyme disease this whole time,

64
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:45,630
but the modes of transmission are only through tick bite, but it is not person to person.

65
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:53,550
So that is the benefit. So how they diagnosis essentially is if the physician is can pinpoint this,

66
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:58,140
they look at your symptoms, they ask you, have you ever been exposed to ticks?

67
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:04,470
There is a possible antibody treatment or antibody testing through the blood.

68
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:13,350
But like if you get bitten by a tick and then you try to get an antibody test like two or three days later, it may not be immediately present.

69
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:19,080
So the best way for them to diagnose it in particular is to just take a look at your symptoms,

70
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:26,730
look for any characteristic rashes, and then ask what you've been doing lately in terms of like outdoor exposures.

71
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:31,530
There is no treatment from this, though.

72
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,019
I mean, there is there is no vaccine.

73
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:43,679
I'm sorry, but you can take pain medications and there are antibiotics because it is a bacteria and you can get recurring Lyme disease.

74
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:49,499
So it's not like if you've had Lyme disease once in your life, you're immune from it forever.

75
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:54,120
It's not like once I've had chickenpox, I'll never get chickenpox again.

76
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,240
You can get Lyme disease multiple times. Yeah.

77
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:02,100
Oh, okay. So not half a degree, 2.3 degrees.

78
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:09,930
So the Great Lakes region, the average temperature has risen by 2.3 degrees since the 1950s.

79
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:15,510
And so the lengthened frost season by six days of the year.

80
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:28,080
So if you look in particular, Ohio in 2008 only had 45 cases of Lyme disease, but in 2019 had 243.

81
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:39,270
Michigan had a super sharp increase of 152 cases in 2015 to 2404 in 2019.

82
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:47,820
So this is the Lyme disease reporting in Michigan since the year 2000.

83
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:56,880
And you can see from over a 20 year period, we've gone to about, you know, two dozen cases per year to you.

84
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:05,290
Well, in the couple of hundreds. And this is again in. Wins by climate change in particular, and then changes in land use.

85
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:09,340
Although for the most part I would say Michigan compared to other states,

86
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:20,559
really values its natural resources and does go to great lengths to try to preserve like natural areas and forests and stuff like that.

87
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:25,690
But there's still a ton of development, as I said, adjacent to it.

88
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:35,350
I think there is that nature area near County Farm Park, which is off like Washtenaw Platt Avenue,

89
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:44,410
and they're thinking of like clearing the the nature area in the back of that to make this mixed income,

90
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:48,610
like with living, walking, development community.

91
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,750
If you're nodding, you've read about that. No.

92
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:54,970
Oh, listening. Oh, yeah. Okay. Yeah.

93
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:57,910
Okay. And then in northern Ann Arbor, too,

94
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:05,080
they're also planning to like the they have like town halls and meetings about this where like U.S. citizens can go to

95
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:13,389
like voiced your concerns about them clearing out like vast amounts of land to put houses or like luxury apartments,

96
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:18,130
for example. Sometimes it's effective, sometimes it's it's it's not.

97
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:25,250
Yes, it's very interesting. Then it's like, um, well, you know,

98
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:31,119
just the natural resources or we can put in like this mixed income development housing rather that

99
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:35,709
like it almost sounds like NIMBYism and like upper class and like Ann Arbor residents being like,

100
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:40,780
no, you can't put like a mixed income housing unit near us.

101
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:44,130
So you have to choose between having the income or like destroying.

102
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:49,990
Yeah, like one is necessary and another like just have.

103
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:53,260
That's the way that that either or. Yeah.

104
00:23:53,560 --> 00:24:00,129
It doesn't have to be. It doesn't have to be for sure. I don't think it's was this class in my other class I talked about zoning.

105
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:02,170
I didn't talk about zoning in this class. Right. Okay.

106
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:10,750
So in particular with zoning laws like at this, usually they happen at the local level rather than like a state level,

107
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:20,710
though depending on the how the land is zoned, there's only like so many types of different things that were permitted to be built there.

108
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:27,700
Right? So, you know, oftentimes, like you might see some like thing and they build something and there like why do they put this there?

109
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:31,059
Like there's so many of those, like they could have put something else there.

110
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:33,850
So for example, when I was living in Indiana,

111
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:40,900
I was living in this like townhome community and there was like this beautiful, like large clearing of forest.

112
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:47,830
They knocked down the forest and they put because it's another college town, they're luxury student apartments.

113
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:51,250
Okay. And the it was called the granite.

114
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:55,780
But the logo I kid you not was literally a giant banana.

115
00:24:56,110 --> 00:25:03,460
So like after these apartments were built, I would look out my kitchen window and just see, like, the granite and then like a giant banana.

116
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:11,229
And I did I did go to the town hall meetings because it's technically a democracy, right?

117
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:19,000
So they had to like let citizens come and talk about that. But they were like, well, this area is only zoned for approval for housing.

118
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:25,630
So only houses or apartments or condos can go there like a car wash or a business couldn't go there,

119
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:32,469
but this land had already been approved to be apartments like way back in the 1990s.

120
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:39,549
They just didn't start building it until now. And the developers weren't even from Bloomington.

121
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:42,370
They lived in Muncie, which was like 2 hours away.

122
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:51,160
So you'll frequently have land developers who don't even live in the city and aren't invested in the city itself, just making profits.

123
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:57,399
But I think a frustrating thing is that they they'll often like proposed things like mixed income housing,

124
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:03,760
which is a great idea, but then they'll end up just putting like luxury condos or like luxury student apartments.

125
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:11,530
And it's like, what about the people who who actually live in this city and aren't like a transient college or or grad

126
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:18,480
student population who can't afford to live in Ann Arbor because their property taxes are so high?

127
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:25,150
Right. One good example in Bloomington, they had a university, they had the the city hospital,

128
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:31,480
and they relocated to the other side of town after they rebuilt a new academic medical center.

129
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:37,240
And so the old you know, the old hospital was in the like plopped in the center of downtown Bloomington.

130
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:45,310
So the city actually bought it from IU health system and they did get it re zoned.

131
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:52,030
So they're going to like knock it down and then turn it into like more affordable apartments

132
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:56,950
just because in that part of town you had a lot of people experiencing homelessness.

133
00:26:56,950 --> 00:27:00,100
But getting zoned is like a huge.

134
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:04,850
It's such a huge issue. Yes.

135
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:09,020
But I think there are like a lot of happy mediums that people don't think about.

136
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:15,150
Like I was just out on Sunday to brunch, you know, Cloverleaf Restaurant downtown on Liberty.

137
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:21,430
It's kind of by like Ruth's roast, no U.S. anchor.

138
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:26,270
Anyway, that was a local breakfast place for many, many years.

139
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:37,790
And they're I heard that they are going to put a Dunkin Donuts in there because they need like more commercial businesses who can like reliably pay

140
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:47,509
the rent essentially for it's like catty corner to the pretzel belt building where like Avalon Cafe and like next to in a holic and stuff like that.

141
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:50,920
So. Who?

142
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:55,280
Okay. Speaking of which, as.

143
00:27:55,280 --> 00:28:01,099
As an aside, please vote. During this election, I've already turned in my absentee ballot,

144
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:06,950
but there are always measures on there regarding generally the environment, depending on where you live.

145
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:13,580
Okay. So what do vectors have to do with environmental justice?

146
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:20,090
Those who are poor or who lack resources are have been the most affected, obviously.

147
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:23,990
So these communities feel the burden of extreme weather events, drought,

148
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:33,680
flooding due to old infrastructure and limited resources for primary prevention and even response and then irrigation practices.

149
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:42,889
There have been there has been environmental racism in terms of irrigation practices where they will bring water

150
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:53,690
sources away from poor communities of color and decrease the amount of natural water availability that they have.

151
00:28:54,020 --> 00:29:01,700
But at the same time, because of land that's been neglected or not taken care of,

152
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:07,009
it will also increase vector breeding sites and then poor housing and living conditions.

153
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:15,770
Again, mold, mildew and vectors. So these disparities in these neighborhoods are due to a failure in investment in

154
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:20,780
the infrastructure and upgrades to make sure everything is up to code and livable.

155
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:28,909
So for example, if we think back to like the February of 2021 where they had that ice storm in Texas,

156
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:34,640
in particular, people who live in nicer houses or more affluent communities,

157
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:44,360
their houses are more likely to have insulation, whereas folks who live in older houses or communities with poor infrastructure,

158
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:47,990
because Texas hasn't I mean, Texas has always been warm.

159
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:52,309
Right. But it hasn't always been as cold as it has been.

160
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:56,629
So a lot of places don't actually the homes don't have insulation.

161
00:29:56,630 --> 00:30:00,260
Like I cannot imagine living in a house here without insulation.

162
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:07,370
The same thing in San Diego where a lot of my friends from college like never moved and they still live in San Diego,

163
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:11,599
which I feel like is a good move. I was just there.

164
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:17,809
But in particular, though, because San Diego historically has been gorgeous, right?

165
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:29,420
I used to wear the same outfits year round because reliably in the mornings it would be like maybe mid-sixties.

166
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:34,219
And then the afternoons are like low seventies, mid seventies.

167
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:43,880
Some days you might get eighties, but I basically wore like a rainbow flip flops and like a cardigan year round.

168
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:54,770
But as the heat due to climate change has increased, so many people's apartments and homes don't have H back central H back.

169
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:59,270
Right. Because they they never needed to build apartments or houses in San Diego.

170
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:04,340
That way you just open the window, you use like a fan, you get fresh air.

171
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:11,270
But now there have been severe issues in terms of like extreme heat in people's houses in San Diego.

172
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:19,160
Yes. And then we've had the subsequent hurricanes, more hurricanes to come.

173
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:28,460
I know this is super small, so I will read it to you or if you can look on your slides.

174
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:36,800
This is pretty old and sadly I haven't been able to find anything more updated and as comprehensive as this.

175
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:44,089
So this is from 2002 and it is the number of cases and raised by racial classification

176
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:52,669
and percentage of cases for 42 selected nationally notifiable disease is so yeah,

177
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:59,870
you have things on there like clot, like botulism and then chlamydia e coli jati.

178
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:08,270
Gonorrhea. But if you look at things like Legionella, for example, which we know are caused by waterborne diseases.

179
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:22,940
If you look at the rates there in terms of the black white ratio for Legionella, it's actually 1.3 even for blacks to whites.

180
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:30,710
And then if you look at other races in particular with Legionella and you'll see different case rates,

181
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:38,660
malaria, you have a 9.0 rate ratio of black to white.

182
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:49,310
Okay. And then if you look at tularemia, interestingly, that is generally caused by like rabbits.

183
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:54,330
And if you're more outdoors, that is a 0.3, which to me makes sense.

184
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:57,680
Does that make sense to other people? Yeah.

185
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:07,230
I see you nodding, white. What does that make sense to you, Paige? And I was really listening.

186
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:14,200
Oh, okay. Okay. All right. Sorry. I've got to stop taking nodding as like I appreciate the affirmations.

187
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:18,360
So tularemia in particular is naturally carried by rabbits and things like that.

188
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:25,440
So if you think about communities who are more likely to live in like rural areas and do farming and will

189
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:32,130
come into contact with rabbits in particular who might be dead or like roadkill and things like that,

190
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:38,310
that's less likely in urban areas in the city.

191
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:42,210
So I don't really look at it. But you said malaria is a disparity.

192
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:48,509
Yes. And let me just line this up here. The U.S. does not have any cases of malaria.

193
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:50,980
That's all like imported from travel. Yes. Yes.

194
00:33:51,020 --> 00:34:06,840
So for malaria, if you line us up, you have in 2002, 634 cases among black people and then only 321 among white people.

195
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:10,170
But they do it per 100,000 population.

196
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:19,660
So that is 1.8 per 100000 to 0.2 per 100,000, bringing a ratio of 9.0.

197
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:23,690
But those are more likely to be travelers.

198
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:24,840
Travelers, right?

199
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:34,560
I mean, not to say that white people don't go to Africa, but, you know, there are more likely black people coming from to and from Africa.

200
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:39,540
Another one in particular, if we look at Lyme disease.

201
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:54,930
Black to white ratio, interestingly, is point one 229 for blacks with a 0.72 per 100,000 versus a 7.8 per 100,000 for white people.

202
00:34:56,010 --> 00:35:05,040
Does that intuitively make sense? Same thing I just explained with the with the kind of like lifestyle thing.

203
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:12,360
So like, for example, like I grew up in Sacramento and I lived there, I don't know,

204
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:19,980
like the first eight years of my life and then another two years between undergrad and grad school.

205
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,260
I lived in like a minority low income community.

206
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:31,110
Nobody goes nobody ever went hiking or camping that I knew well.

207
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:34,709
Right. Because people just didn't. Number one, that's expensive.

208
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:40,370
Like recreation is expensive. Tennis shoes, all the equipment, blah, blah.

209
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:51,180
And if you live in an urban dense area to go hiking to a place like that, I'm not driving for hours to get to Big Sur or like Yosemite.

210
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:54,690
Right. Because who has the time for that kind of recreation?

211
00:35:54,690 --> 00:36:02,100
Those things cost money. You're busy working like your part time job or like supporting your parents and other things.

212
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:10,410
Whereas it wasn't until I went to college that I started meeting people particularly

213
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:15,360
more white and then affluent people who partake in recreational activities.

214
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:25,920
So that in turn makes them more likely to be exposed to things like Lyme disease just because of the types of activities that they partake in.

215
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:31,200
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I think this is a good passing point.

216
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:37,870
So I will introduce our guest and then I will leave.
