Hi. My name is Danielle Lee. I'm professor and associate chair of Health Management and Policy in the School of Public Health.

2
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:20,650
Welcome to the module.

3
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:33,040
In this module, we'll continue to discuss management of health organizations focusing on another critical element of organizations human resources.

4
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:39,370
That is people. Now you may say, why is this topic relevant to me?

5
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:41,980
I'm not going to be a human resource manager.

6
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:51,180
Well, it is relevant to you unless you plan to be an entrepreneur and for a one person company through all your entire career.

7
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:59,490
Otherwise, understanding and knowledge of management and human resource management is highly relevant to you.

8
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:09,920
Because we all work in organizations and because many, if not all of you will be management positions in charge of managing people.

9
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:15,030
Until robots could completely replace human beings as the workforce,

10
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:22,830
it's impossible to talk about organizations and management without thinking about people other than financial capital.

11
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:33,180
People are the most important element and constitute the largest category of expenses in organizations, including health organizations.

12
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,160
Let's take chess, a community health center in Detroit as an example.

13
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:48,970
At chess, it's personal costs, salary and benefits consume almost 60% of the total operating expenses.

14
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:54,850
And this doesn't count the costs due to turnover, recruitment and training.

15
00:01:55,420 --> 00:02:00,430
On the other hand, poor management of human resources could be very costly.

16
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:09,190
Every year, employee turnover and disengagement costs the US economy more than $500 billion.

17
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:14,630
Now we know how important human resources are to organizations.

18
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,970
What is human resource management then? What does he do?

19
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:29,300
Human Resource Management or H.R., in broadly speaking, is the management and development of employees in an organization.

20
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:39,080
Basically, human resource management involves overseeing everything related to managing an organization's human capital.

21
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:48,790
It also includes creating, managing and cultivating the relationship between the employer and the employees.

22
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:52,420
There are six basic human resource functions.

23
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:58,270
The first function is checking applicants and hiring strategically.

24
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,930
In other words, managing the hiring process.

25
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:10,270
Let me give you two quotes. First, in his bestselling book, Go to Great, author Jim Collins stressed,

26
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:18,580
I quote Leaders of company that go from good to great start now with where but with who.

27
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:24,490
They start by getting the right people on the bus. First the people, then the direction.

28
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:34,690
Unquote. Similarly, the famed former CEO, Jack Welch once said, I quote, I only have three things to do.

29
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:43,090
I have to choose the right people, allocate the right number of dollars and translate ideas from one vision to another with the speed of light.

30
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:49,300
So I'm really in the business of being the gatekeeper and the transmitter of ideas, unquote.

31
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,770
Notice that the first thing that he focused on is the right people.

32
00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:00,490
Similar to what Jim Collins said. Getting the right people on the bus.

33
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:10,480
Indeed, supplying organizations with qualified and reliable talents is a critical function of human resources management.

34
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:15,610
The second basically function is 20 managers and employees.

35
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:20,260
Once hired, talents need development.

36
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:27,639
Therefore, Human Resource Management play a critical role in training manager to be better

37
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:33,640
leaders and training people employees to have a deeper and wider skill set.

38
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:40,300
The third basic function is designing the onboarding process for new employees.

39
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:47,170
Many health organizations in particular are complex and have very distinct culture.

40
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:52,990
So it is difficult for new employees to hit the ground running right away.

41
00:04:53,890 --> 00:05:00,459
It is human resource management a responsibility to make it easy or easier for

42
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:05,740
new employees to adjust and be integrated into a new environment and culture.

43
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:12,130
The fourth basic function is managing pay, benefits and time off.

44
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:17,080
It's actually quite easy to think about the importance of this function by

45
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:23,290
asking ourselves what we stay long in an organization is it pays you poorly.

46
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:29,080
Offers limited, limited benefits, including time off. I wouldn't say so.

47
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,170
So design and management are salary time off.

48
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:44,470
Benefits can save organizations lots of money, time and effort in employee retention and reduce the loss of talents due to turnover.

49
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:56,470
The next basic function is conflict resolution, which is critically important simply because conflicts are inevitable where they are people.

50
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:07,229
Conflict resolution is particularly important in health organizations because many employees tend to have diverse professional backgrounds in,

51
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:18,930
for example, medicine, nursing, public health, social work, do tuition, pharmacy, business, psychology and other social sciences, you name it.

52
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:25,470
Because of the diverse background, they bring different values and preferences to the workplace.

53
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:30,800
If managed to, well, the differences are the source of innovation and synergy.

54
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:34,880
That's why we celebrate differences and diversity.

55
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:40,640
But managing poorly the differences may lead to conflict.

56
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:55,760
Studies have shown that 67% of people avoid coworkers because of office conflicts and 25% avoid conflicts by simply not coming to work.

57
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:01,330
So imagine the cost if conflicts are now properly managed.

58
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:09,800
Finally, human resources management may have to handle legal issues on behalf of organizations.

59
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:17,700
Human Resource Management is responsible for the compliance of labor and employment laws.

60
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:25,100
He also handles discrimination and harassment complaints in 2016 alone.

61
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:35,940
There were over 91,000 discrimination harassment charges filed with the EEOC, this US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

62
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:44,390
So having a dedicated human resources specialist handling legal issues is very important for organizations.

63
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:49,470
Don't take those six functions for granted. Let's just imagine.

64
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:59,010
What the situation may be if human resources management is completely absent or if they're doing a very poor job.

65
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:05,650
There will be poor hiring. Many getting wrong the wrong people on the bus, so to speak.

66
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:17,210
Pool pay and benefits management. As a result, the morale among employees will be low, and they have very poor commitment to the organization.

67
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:26,630
And because of dissatisfaction and conflict, the work environment could be toxic and the organization ends up with a terrible reputation.

68
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:32,720
Just imagine all this consequences. Would you want to be in that kind of organization?

69
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:43,340
I'm sure the answer is absolutely no. Finally, it's useful to think about human resources management as a piece in a puzzle.

70
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,180
As a matter of fact, human resources management is the piece that links everything together,

71
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:57,020
is critically important for organizations and will affect any organization's future development.

72
00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:03,470
Strategic planning and implementation. Productivity and performance and reputation.
