1
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:08,940
okay afternoon everyone. so

2
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:14,780
I think you probably wanna know if you got a couple of announcements in the last

3
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:21,380
forty five minutes or so. she might got an extra one.

4
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:26,500
alright. so before we start that. I wanna formally interview

5
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:36,540
someone on Credit. please have a class. alright. bye.

6
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:48,840
yeah. anyway

7
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:54,120
and since she can't say something like that. I'm gonna tell you about. you know

8
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:59,239
always and there's a GFI right at the beginning. I she

9
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:04,259
understands this material. perhaps better than I do. we just

10
00:01:04,259 --> 00:01:09,299
say she perform very well in the class. so if you have technical questions about the material that just

11
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:14,299
about mechanics of the class is actually May the first to speak with. my humble

12
00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:19,499
opinion. okay. so

13
00:01:19,499 --> 00:01:24,599
with respect to the announcement. so the first one or

14
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:30,519
if you got two versions of them but anyway the first one was about the

15
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:36,999
debates and presentations that you gonna do. I think it's all self explanatory.

16
00:01:36,999 --> 00:01:42,239
because I haven't learned how to send out an announcement

17
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:47,399
that has more in one attachment. like I can Cathy everything at single PDF. so

18
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:53,259
you have it all in one PDF pajama pages you the service sort through to see which one.

19
00:01:53,259 --> 00:01:59,253
this is a case that yours attached. so I don't that. they wanna look at that

20
00:01:59,253 --> 00:02:05,313
okay we're there. I mean whether it was or anything. we are

21
00:02:05,313 --> 00:02:12,193
pretty clear. okay. great. the second one is

22
00:02:12,193 --> 00:02:17,973
for this Thursday and I just got a couple meds before I came down.

23
00:02:17,973 --> 00:02:23,053
rather than having the main activity be at lecture. we're gonna have

24
00:02:23,053 --> 00:02:28,073
the main activity class discussion and lessons

25
00:02:28,073 --> 00:02:34,813
and the about vacation time from Oak tomorrow propane. the ECT

26
00:02:34,813 --> 00:02:39,973
which is a test side. it's been

27
00:02:39,973 --> 00:02:45,053
a mad house for for work and you have

28
00:02:45,053 --> 00:02:50,133
ask you to complete or ask for most series for reading and what

29
00:02:50,133 --> 00:02:56,193
I am asking everyone to do between now and one o'clock on Thursday.

30
00:02:56,193 --> 00:03:02,305
is to look cafeteria

31
00:03:02,305 --> 00:03:07,365
carefully and actually tried to jot down the answers to what you said to the best answers

32
00:03:07,365 --> 00:03:12,885
to those questions as you go along and it's dad. yeah and there's a chance instructions.

33
00:03:12,885 --> 00:03:18,365
what I like you to do two

34
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:23,405
you. first article article and try to answer all questions

35
00:03:23,405 --> 00:03:29,125
after that. this play. well if you can before you go on article be

36
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:34,565
as on. CD forty five fifty.

37
00:03:34,565 --> 00:03:40,085
thanks for doing that. you you'll find the exercise in a bit more lively

38
00:03:40,085 --> 00:03:45,405
because you may get some surprises as you go along it's probably better to sort of

39
00:03:45,405 --> 00:03:50,545
know how things happen. but is actually in the pot logical order but it's in order from

40
00:03:50,545 --> 00:03:56,425
which sort of things are reported by the church. so this particular

41
00:03:56,425 --> 00:04:01,925
exercise we'll talk about. it raises a_lot_of you know technical

42
00:04:01,925 --> 00:04:07,585
questions questions about pesticides and questions about

43
00:04:07,585 --> 00:04:12,725
how you should try to determine what those effectively and how you shut the standards

44
00:04:12,725 --> 00:04:18,385
but also also Raven. I think a_lot_of complicated ethical

45
00:04:18,385 --> 00:04:24,445
tomorrow. questions and questions around

46
00:04:24,445 --> 00:04:31,965
issues like environmental classes and so on. I think you'll find quite interesting

47
00:04:31,965 --> 00:04:38,005
classroom. the story. okay. good.

48
00:04:38,005 --> 00:04:43,385
it's gonna be fresh. I think. so that's that that I think of you on Thursday actually

49
00:04:43,385 --> 00:04:48,565
right after class. I will also post one additional reading on

50
00:04:48,565 --> 00:04:53,785
the ECT. again I would ask you to go to the exercise

51
00:04:53,785 --> 00:04:58,805
actually before you do the reading reading is sort of similar to what

52
00:04:58,805 --> 00:05:04,141
in section D of exercise okay. alright. and then.

53
00:05:04,141 --> 00:05:09,381
more generally. yeah the family is on board. she

54
00:05:09,381 --> 00:05:16,021
and I talked but we haven't finished talking as much as we need to.

55
00:05:16,021 --> 00:05:21,021
I'm gonna try to get everything regular lives and get it done

56
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:26,101
far ahead of time and have a look pretty and have you be able to go to a single place and see

57
00:05:26,101 --> 00:05:31,141
what everything is gonna happen the next week and so on. so we'll be working on that. alright.

58
00:05:31,141 --> 00:05:43,401
so again. any questions or comments about any of that. yeah.

59
00:05:43,401 --> 00:05:48,741
yeah. this is Tuesday. but yeah I will.

60
00:05:48,741 --> 00:05:56,561
if not you'll see when you look at that. I'll see you looking at right now it's not.

61
00:05:56,561 --> 00:06:01,641
yeah. alright. well that was the last thing I was trying to refer to. I

62
00:06:01,641 --> 00:06:11,063
wanted haven't talk to a. yes

63
00:06:11,063 --> 00:06:16,143
it's all the thing. it's all together. if you're not

64
00:06:16,143 --> 00:06:21,243
there. okay

65
00:06:21,243 --> 00:06:27,223
no problem. okay. anything else. alright.

66
00:06:27,223 --> 00:06:49,435
so

67
00:06:49,435 --> 00:06:54,435
okay so we're gonna talk about new Tony Elsie. which just means long with

68
00:06:54,435 --> 00:06:59,555
the hard file and healing. I am gonna focus

69
00:06:59,555 --> 00:07:04,635
on for the big three days. there are other conditions. but the

70
00:07:04,635 --> 00:07:10,195
ones that have had the greatest impact and continue to have a great impact

71
00:07:10,195 --> 00:07:15,255
on people in United_States but people across the world. alright that's it. so look at

72
00:07:15,255 --> 00:07:20,715
hole. let's spend time talking about that. there's a_lot_of file here.

73
00:07:20,715 --> 00:07:25,755
I'm probably going to find out. maybe highlights and some of the size but not

74
00:07:25,755 --> 00:07:30,795
talk in great detail about each one and I will try to underscore what I think

75
00:07:30,795 --> 00:07:35,795
is most important as we go along. so here's

76
00:07:35,795 --> 00:07:42,580
the town of this message which I believe is located

77
00:07:42,580 --> 00:09:21,424
I'm not doing well. very sorry. bye

78
00:09:21,424 --> 00:09:38,584
just a moment.

79
00:09:38,584 --> 00:09:44,028
this is Sharon will show up.

80
00:09:44,028 --> 00:09:53,988
may not know that

81
00:09:53,988 --> 00:10:08,348
it's working okay. great.

82
00:10:08,348 --> 00:10:13,508
do not at all. alright. so this is town it's actually named as best

83
00:10:13,508 --> 00:10:21,308
just because there's for the best of mine there I think it's in Quebec Canada. and

84
00:10:21,308 --> 00:10:26,968
and so this is the Jeffrey mind and this is. so you know the best thing to

85
00:10:26,968 --> 00:10:32,088
that material the earth is mine. either you do underground mining. you do

86
00:10:32,088 --> 00:10:37,258
a whole tunnel and you got there it's about you. are you do

87
00:10:37,258 --> 00:10:42,318
this is open face surface mining we you just remove everything on that you're

88
00:10:42,318 --> 00:10:47,778
not going to use the court. has a_lot more environmentally fax in doing underground.

89
00:10:47,778 --> 00:10:54,018
but this is just to give you a sense of this quite a large operation that's going on for quite

90
00:10:54,018 --> 00:10:59,338
a_while. my name is Beth. just this area in Quebec. alright. so

91
00:10:59,338 --> 00:11:04,418
first part about that. I wanted to start first that this is what are the key fact that I

92
00:11:04,418 --> 00:11:10,198
think you wanna know. so they're up here. someone is that

93
00:11:10,198 --> 00:11:15,298
that this is unusual because the topic property some other things are gonna stop

94
00:11:15,298 --> 00:11:20,438
in here. actually depends specifically on the tenth. if that's true.

95
00:11:20,438 --> 00:11:26,258
so for example what comes next. but in the case of bed basket.

96
00:11:26,258 --> 00:11:31,418
and that's that's that's like material. the topic property seem to be not much related to the tenth

97
00:11:31,418 --> 00:11:36,658
the first day and to what call aspect ratio. the fact

98
00:11:36,658 --> 00:11:41,778
is there very long. see you then. bye. very very long. typical

99
00:11:41,778 --> 00:11:47,598
aspect ratio. you know where it might be a hundred to one and

100
00:11:47,598 --> 00:11:52,798
that had impact on where. if they're in here.

101
00:11:52,798 --> 00:11:57,958
where in the long they can deposit. and also to apologize for this

102
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:03,278
message. something wrong. actually removed the agent. alright.

103
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:08,398
and that's it. it's Dorothy it's been used in thousands of products

104
00:12:08,398 --> 00:12:13,738
and I believe myself unfortunately it's continuing to be used

105
00:12:13,738 --> 00:12:18,798
very wisely in the world. potentially continuing continuing to be

106
00:12:18,798 --> 00:12:24,418
used very wisely and low and middle income countries. and the reason it uses

107
00:12:24,418 --> 00:12:29,798
it. there's a_lot_of available in the mind it's not too expensive and it has all the great

108
00:12:29,798 --> 00:12:34,948
property. it's very strong resistance being towards the damaged

109
00:12:34,948 --> 00:12:40,088
hey but also to this event. seating doesn't break down about

110
00:12:40,088 --> 00:12:45,088
ten on Saturday and it's got a fantastic job. insulating

111
00:12:45,088 --> 00:12:50,708
things again. so for example you at all.

112
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:55,908
the installation on height and furnaces including factory

113
00:12:55,908 --> 00:13:00,988
about something people home for the most part before for the mid nineteen

114
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:06,428
seventies. I have_to contain financial fraction.

115
00:13:06,428 --> 00:13:11,828
so this is not true like schools. the problem you're all aware of this already.

116
00:13:11,828 --> 00:13:16,842
but that's why there's continuing concern with this message

117
00:13:16,842 --> 00:13:22,602
the exposure is even here in the US where it's not being used as a finish product.

118
00:13:22,602 --> 00:13:30,242
almost at all. certainly not in construction any more. for installation and Broadway way

119
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:36,222
for installation salon. I'm at work call man eight zero five five. bye.

120
00:13:36,222 --> 00:13:41,242
and there one are five glasses there's concerns about most

121
00:13:41,242 --> 00:13:46,502
of the done thing. the same problems is best does. but they also her lungs and fibers

122
00:13:46,502 --> 00:13:51,642
yet. they have lost again.

123
00:13:51,642 --> 00:13:58,782
I did not receive all of this about this but a couple things about Tom. wanted

124
00:13:58,782 --> 00:14:04,002
bodied to pass it can break them down a little bit more easily than I can investors

125
00:14:04,002 --> 00:14:09,502
and the other thing is when is best is fractured. it tends to just increase aspect

126
00:14:09,502 --> 00:14:14,782
test the fracture on the line. which makes it more of a problem where most

127
00:14:14,782 --> 00:14:22,053
time. Monroe five fracture across

128
00:14:22,053 --> 00:14:27,133
practice. so yeah so

129
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:32,273
it's different they're different in that way. okay. so there's

130
00:14:32,273 --> 00:14:37,413
three type it in the car. there's a price of tile

131
00:14:37,413 --> 00:14:42,573
which is greater than ninety percent. even in the store. you agreed

132
00:14:42,573 --> 00:14:47,573
to ninety percent with being used currently in the world. and there's posted a light in

133
00:14:47,573 --> 00:14:52,673
the on the site and use your see in a couple of five. the physical form prior to Tyler's little

134
00:14:52,673 --> 00:14:58,433
different than the purpose of the lighting outside and you got

135
00:14:58,433 --> 00:15:03,713
mine. we just looked at it the back. actually they're still active mining

136
00:15:03,713 --> 00:15:08,913
other stuff that's going on in Canada. so for the most part. you have_to

137
00:15:08,913 --> 00:15:14,773
use this as many places and materials in Canada

138
00:15:14,773 --> 00:15:20,721
Canada export online. that other country.

139
00:15:20,721 --> 00:15:25,881
just one one case it's something that perhaps problematic for channels during

140
00:15:25,881 --> 00:15:31,541
United_States is make the exception to the rule perhaps.

141
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:38,221
so we'll talk about that. one of the big issues is

142
00:15:38,221 --> 00:15:43,561
do this whole campaign. I'm gonna be very Frank about like

143
00:15:43,561 --> 00:15:48,661
about it. I called the campaign get this information. we're just

144
00:15:48,661 --> 00:15:54,681
trying to say hi to Tyler as best as long while.

145
00:15:54,681 --> 00:15:59,861
sound safer. isn't nearly as harmful as the other type of business.

146
00:15:59,861 --> 00:16:04,901
and it's really you. I can't remember. I don't think this is number

147
00:16:04,901 --> 00:16:10,321
is five dollars but just let me tell you what the situation is. we're gonna talk about. three

148
00:16:10,321 --> 00:16:16,779
major pollen and very adverse out

149
00:16:16,779 --> 00:16:22,139
why is going to be one five. the new McCall.

150
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:27,399
this is not a late date which is. so you can hand out literally

151
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:32,779
not being able to breathe eventually from the non- malignant thanks. the second

152
00:16:32,779 --> 00:16:38,699
is clearly high hobby. most heart

153
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:43,699
long cancer. have a small something in the center.

154
00:16:43,699 --> 00:16:48,779
before. this did not have cancer that's almost half

155
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:54,079
or not. that means that if you see this cancer. there's been invested. that's

156
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:59,799
the farm type material exposure. partly no nothing else. have a chance.

157
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:05,179
I'll meet you later on. so long.

158
00:17:05,179 --> 00:17:10,559
actually probably diaphragm and also talk cancer in the abdomen the line in the afternoon

159
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:15,939
as well. so here's the thing you left it all up

160
00:17:15,939 --> 00:17:22,039
to date. that last month and we need. does look like probably

161
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:27,059
for satellite outside maybe four times. put in four times as likely

162
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:33,679
for the same dosage to do is meet with you in. then press pound or

163
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:38,819
something with it but it's not there. however if you look

164
00:17:38,819 --> 00:17:44,759
at lung cancer. Garden variety lung cancer and

165
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:50,739
process. and you actually look at the literature. there's actually no difference between

166
00:17:50,739 --> 00:17:57,639
height the tile and the other two types. they're all about. he believes he knows now.

167
00:17:57,639 --> 00:18:02,899
my time the campaign of this information. trying to push price it out.

168
00:18:02,899 --> 00:18:09,913
so it's pretty great. we can use it. alright. and

169
00:18:09,913 --> 00:18:15,013
by way another place and a_lot_of people got exposure which is still you. even

170
00:18:15,013 --> 00:18:20,313
the time that I think is allowed in the US but typically it's not used it all. but

171
00:18:20,313 --> 00:18:26,453
it used to use the light and brake line. because what a bright line for the first reception.

172
00:18:26,453 --> 00:18:31,453
stop our truck and so you want something that

173
00:18:31,453 --> 00:18:36,913
we are aware of this heat resistant because then it will last

174
00:18:36,913 --> 00:18:41,973
longer. so that's just an eighth grade great by now they're

175
00:18:41,973 --> 00:18:47,053
used very tight five or glass. alright. so

176
00:18:47,053 --> 00:18:52,073
the next key back where it says that installation exposure from

177
00:18:52,073 --> 00:18:57,373
installation building is only for five five oh returning

178
00:18:57,373 --> 00:19:03,393
falling apart breaking apart coming loose. you know wait

179
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:08,593
there for five into the air. so the reason it's good to know about

180
00:19:08,593 --> 00:19:14,017
that are important to know about this is supposed you were to have a child

181
00:19:14,017 --> 00:19:19,597
and you find out that the child is on to older school. when you find out did you

182
00:19:19,597 --> 00:19:24,657
still have a_lot_of hiking with this installation. this message contains

183
00:19:24,657 --> 00:19:29,997
installation wrapped around it. and then the question is what to do about it. so the choices

184
00:19:29,997 --> 00:19:36,097
are. nothing or close to the school or

185
00:19:36,097 --> 00:19:41,217
remove all of that or can we leave it in place and

186
00:19:41,217 --> 00:19:46,557
somehow protect teachers and children from being exposed to it.

187
00:19:46,557 --> 00:19:52,431
okay. so

188
00:19:52,431 --> 00:19:57,591
hi it's David again. standard

189
00:19:57,591 --> 00:20:02,831
standard include lot of information required about how you have_to

190
00:20:02,831 --> 00:20:08,031
remove it. that's it. if you can remove it and all the things they're trying

191
00:20:08,031 --> 00:20:13,431
to prevent the release of fibers to the general air and whatever building you're working in.

192
00:20:13,431 --> 00:20:18,831
so it includes things like before you work because that has_to be thoroughly wet with water.

193
00:20:18,831 --> 00:20:23,891
so that that makes it much less likely fibers will come apart in the air.

194
00:20:23,891 --> 00:20:28,991
and also you're required to have a local exhaust ventilation and put up

195
00:20:28,991 --> 00:20:35,271
about the plastic sheet. just clean service area you're working with that. physically separated

196
00:20:35,271 --> 00:20:40,551
from other area and your dog have or requirements about careful clean up and

197
00:20:40,551 --> 00:20:46,151
clean up that be done vacuuming out with brooms or that kind of thing. which will put more fibers in there

198
00:20:46,151 --> 00:20:51,231
and as often as the rules about what to do with the way you can just send it to a regular doctor that's got

199
00:20:51,231 --> 00:20:56,654
a special way okay so yeah you know

200
00:20:56,654 --> 00:21:02,254
who we were talking about. this is gonna be done the right way. the legal way.

201
00:21:02,254 --> 00:21:07,334
it's probably safe to do the removal and not a bad idea. however if it's

202
00:21:07,334 --> 00:21:12,374
not done the right way. which does sometimes happen even now you're it.

203
00:21:12,374 --> 00:21:17,534
you can text to make the situation worse

204
00:21:17,534 --> 00:21:22,634
more around from removing it because it wasn't done properly and so

205
00:21:22,634 --> 00:21:27,634
the other thing. the other approach is. if it's not too far but not too broken up

206
00:21:27,634 --> 00:21:32,754
or even is broken up there. it's a wrap and tape and so on and monitor

207
00:21:32,754 --> 00:21:38,014
that and basically I need only things that are more last on. that can be used

208
00:21:38,014 --> 00:21:43,074
as well. basically you can close it. so leave process. if

209
00:21:43,074 --> 00:21:48,134
there's that that fiber is actually getting in the air in your four that doesn't actually need a service anyone in

210
00:21:48,134 --> 00:21:53,140
the building. you should just be aware of these issues currently in the US

211
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:58,600
even though we're not using this message and buildings any more. alright. so we

212
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:03,840
we talked about Halifax. alright. the big three

213
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:09,020
are at the tone. the phone if I process along with that. which will come

214
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:14,420
to a couple of times. you also can get. so I'm actually in the Philly all over the

215
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:20,460
cancer of the floor right the membrane line. the longer than that and the

216
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:25,540
rapid cavity. the other thing is that this doesn't thinking possible. also

217
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:30,600
snacks are thinking. I think we have a photograph that coming up. that

218
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:36,840
usually it doesn't problem. unless it's really

219
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:42,100
very expensive which is unusual. then I can actually restrict

220
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:47,980
one with the phone just to keep along from expanding the way they should. it's more of a marker

221
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:53,020
that the person that has significant asbestos exposure. so if you see you out lapping the

222
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:59,062
also I've here four o'clock. can't really be mistaken for anything else.

223
00:22:59,062 --> 00:23:04,082
if you see that you are the person probably has special exposure and therefore it's probably a higher

224
00:23:04,082 --> 00:23:09,302
risk for developing these other problem. so that's more what it means.

225
00:23:09,302 --> 00:23:14,462
besides lung cancer miss is healing. there are no other cancers is better. so save

226
00:23:14,462 --> 00:23:20,202
it increase bit. if you had a special exposure to various gastrointestinal cancers.

227
00:23:20,202 --> 00:23:25,562
some upper respiratory like as of the last name the fax and there's something pre- chance

228
00:23:25,562 --> 00:23:31,082
kidney cancer that they will not be in your apartment. bye the

229
00:23:31,082 --> 00:23:36,702
relative risk for the lower than they are for long cancer meet with you Leona

230
00:23:36,702 --> 00:23:41,922
and Marcus is quite common and so most of the most of the day and cancer problems

231
00:23:41,922 --> 00:23:48,082
with cancer gonna come from either Missus Gilliam or the lung cancer.

232
00:23:48,082 --> 00:23:53,182
so we do have a continuing epidemic. as this is

233
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:58,954
related to the it's Brandon. multi in Kentucky.

234
00:23:58,954 --> 00:24:04,254
John's on using all middle town countries. and I told you about this discontinued

235
00:24:04,254 --> 00:24:09,354
campaign already. that's important. so for example.

236
00:24:09,354 --> 00:24:15,114
I was on sabbatical I'm gonna working on another project and help you with that.

237
00:24:15,114 --> 00:24:20,794
and I getting introduced to someone who was originally from China and they've been gone for a_while

238
00:24:20,794 --> 00:24:26,114
and he was basically he owns a construction company

239
00:24:26,114 --> 00:24:31,134
and he with you. he knew that that it was supposed

240
00:24:31,134 --> 00:24:36,594
be so good but he didn't know a_lot about it. but he was using that

241
00:24:36,594 --> 00:24:45,714
you wanted to. she wants to rent apartment

242
00:24:45,714 --> 00:24:50,774
buildings and so and I you know generally turn them

243
00:24:50,774 --> 00:24:56,480
off the chance you know really might be worth spending a little bit of extra money

244
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:02,420
two. you have for the substitute. that work rather than use it as best.

245
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:07,520
but this is like a situation that's is quite typical. actually there's a_lot_of money

246
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:13,740
in this message in China. and I need a_lot_of continued use in country. to my understanding.

247
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:18,820
building a home in other places in China using

248
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:24,060
as best. is anyone who's from China. spend a_lot_of time trying to sort of knows

249
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:32,220
what the situation is on the ground in the room. okay.

250
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:39,080
so the third. so this is a big fax to keep in mind that it's Masters.

251
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:44,380
I need a definition it's the fiber is minimal.

252
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:49,640
we are talked about. why why people like it might useful. and it has been extreme aspect

253
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:56,056
ratio. hello. hello. this is Sander

254
00:25:56,056 --> 00:26:01,316
Annie standard is actually for exposure to workers day.

255
00:26:01,316 --> 00:26:06,396
eight hour days and average of zero point one five or for CC

256
00:26:06,396 --> 00:26:12,156
for two weeks meter there and you'll see later that

257
00:26:12,156 --> 00:26:17,296
dramatically down from what was used before that's mostly the thing to really drive

258
00:26:17,296 --> 00:26:22,556
at the most of anyone cancer meet with you. so first ten to present at this time

259
00:26:22,556 --> 00:26:27,556
as well. so I think it's worth a note in here on the screen is

260
00:26:27,556 --> 00:26:32,616
that yes the final fiber.

261
00:26:32,616 --> 00:26:37,736
when you say you know that. this is the standard zero one one five is for CC.

262
00:26:37,736 --> 00:26:42,736
the formal definition the legal definition of fiber is in preparation for the three to one.

263
00:26:42,736 --> 00:26:47,836
okay. even though most of them are like a hundred to one. the

264
00:26:47,836 --> 00:26:53,236
price of tile is Kirby. I am supposed to check with Chris.

265
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:59,296
Chris is the light in outside of Arlington. we have straight five. they look different.

266
00:26:59,296 --> 00:27:04,696
and he said he's been working historically reminding

267
00:27:04,696 --> 00:27:10,016
you travel light. I was in so much. you

268
00:27:10,016 --> 00:27:15,076
have there. I talk to you know if anything bye.

269
00:27:15,076 --> 00:27:20,656
Tal. for example the part of the town. they have traveled in it and so on

270
00:27:20,656 --> 00:27:27,047
and that the last two. you don't run into too often. I

271
00:27:27,047 --> 00:27:32,647
yeah Canada. used to be the main supplier you at. we don't have in Vegas at this time.

272
00:27:32,647 --> 00:27:37,747
South Africa where got a_lot_of time with pride early

273
00:27:37,747 --> 00:27:42,807
country with a reminder and a_lot_of it's best to South Africa by the way.

274
00:27:42,807 --> 00:27:49,427
no longer mind any of that and they no longer export.

275
00:27:49,427 --> 00:27:54,607
you often. African national congress came in the power and so I saw

276
00:27:54,607 --> 00:27:59,707
a little upside down first time I've ever in South Africa was nineteen ninety two

277
00:27:59,707 --> 00:28:04,947
and I was taken to town Hall Creek. he are i.e. E K.

278
00:28:04,947 --> 00:28:11,667
we chatted that's this morning there and that issue there. which is an issue.

279
00:28:11,667 --> 00:28:16,867
bye. you have. when you get money. call us right

280
00:28:16,867 --> 00:28:22,827
away with your house or mine which is what you're looking for that. there's

281
00:28:22,827 --> 00:28:28,445
things that have some and you're not using huge giant mountain

282
00:28:28,445 --> 00:28:34,625
almost more like mini mouse tail and

283
00:28:34,625 --> 00:28:39,905
material.

284
00:28:39,905 --> 00:28:45,025
now I got like you know local children with go play on these because it was the only

285
00:28:45,025 --> 00:28:50,105
thing that wasn't flat in the area. so I like that. so there's really there's big issues with

286
00:28:50,105 --> 00:28:56,145
environmental contamination town. well and so in that. you know usually

287
00:28:56,145 --> 00:29:01,545
you see very few month lease. she's gonna see

288
00:29:01,545 --> 00:29:06,625
if you might wanna. probably

289
00:29:06,625 --> 00:29:12,645
from this matter. talking about situation. you know that

290
00:29:12,645 --> 00:29:18,165
almost all cases you see her in the people are actually worse than nine years or whatever they were doing.

291
00:29:18,165 --> 00:29:23,625
alright. bye. in this place. they had an accident. I

292
00:29:23,625 --> 00:29:28,729
need to see Leona in the whole population the town. women had actually worked in the mind

293
00:29:28,729 --> 00:29:34,089
of lots of them and we're to go out to meet with you lay on that because it was still present and it was very difficult

294
00:29:34,089 --> 00:29:39,089
to clean up in expense rush.

295
00:29:39,089 --> 00:29:44,129
also the large producer in has China. we

296
00:29:44,129 --> 00:29:49,389
talked about it. commercial products with use I won't repeat it to you just the words use a_lot_of

297
00:29:49,389 --> 00:29:55,029
places. for example I was involved in the study. back in

298
00:29:55,029 --> 00:30:00,029
late eighties. they were using it any more that was discontinued in the seventy back in

299
00:30:00,029 --> 00:30:05,409
late eighties where they were making acoustic tile

300
00:30:05,409 --> 00:30:10,469
for indoor. it contained. there had been a_lot_of exposures and

301
00:30:10,469 --> 00:30:15,509
disease among people who worked at this particular plant was in Northern

302
00:30:15,509 --> 00:30:20,709
Minnesota. there's been some unusual product that

303
00:30:20,709 --> 00:30:25,869
we're using made I guess before there is this is Fish in recognition

304
00:30:25,869 --> 00:30:31,489
of the hazards associated with it. here's it pretty interesting old at advertising

305
00:30:31,489 --> 00:30:37,069
for ten days. so Thursday we're made up for satellite.

306
00:30:37,069 --> 00:30:42,109
that's best. so you got a little extra something from and healing. over and beyond what you got

307
00:30:42,109 --> 00:30:47,209
from the tobacco. we

308
00:30:47,209 --> 00:30:52,249
to talk about this that idea that exposure happening the fire is getting to

309
00:30:52,249 --> 00:30:57,689
you long. just because it's present if it's not five oh. if it's in case.

310
00:30:57,689 --> 00:31:02,789
it's not necessarily a hazard. and it's not always the smartest move to decide to remove it. it's

311
00:31:02,789 --> 00:31:08,009
the posting case. the health risk

312
00:31:08,009 --> 00:31:13,709
is almost entirely in relation. that's it doesn't really hesitate through this again.

313
00:31:13,709 --> 00:31:18,769
it's not all that clear about. even if this message contains drinking water with

314
00:31:18,769 --> 00:31:24,379
you see much disease from in just another test

315
00:31:24,379 --> 00:31:29,579
so here's the price for tile which is Kirby at serpentine

316
00:31:29,579 --> 00:31:34,699
like a snake. and this

317
00:31:34,699 --> 00:31:40,319
is estimate numbers of exposure. number to work is exposed

318
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:45,539
you noticed that there's a huge number of workers exposed.

319
00:31:45,539 --> 00:31:51,059
there are a_lot_of people who were involved in the United_States as well as other countries

320
00:31:51,059 --> 00:32:02,819
with ship building. yet.

321
00:32:02,819 --> 00:32:08,679
it is not too big. I think I think they're having with their hand

322
00:32:08,679 --> 00:32:14,239
probably usually means that some of us also getting in the air. and my guesses

323
00:32:14,239 --> 00:32:19,239
in that situation. it's much more likely that in relation. it's more

324
00:32:19,239 --> 00:32:24,715
of a problem then just because it because you maybe talk this evening

325
00:32:24,715 --> 00:32:29,895
Jackson but it's clearly in a much lower level for whatever you wanna say you not hurt

326
00:32:29,895 --> 00:32:35,275
grandma five and it gets in the body. much less I a you in here.

327
00:32:35,275 --> 00:32:40,875
so it's probably a big problem. just quick question.

328
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:45,915
during World_War_II. the number because

329
00:32:45,915 --> 00:32:51,695
was going on there with lots of shifts are being built downstairs. so like that right. and

330
00:32:51,695 --> 00:32:56,975
there are huge numbers of people temporarily employed and ship building

331
00:32:56,975 --> 00:33:02,135
and but quite a few people even all day. they maybe only work one

332
00:33:02,135 --> 00:33:07,295
to three years in doing ship building. you can quite a few cases needs

333
00:33:07,295 --> 00:33:12,305
to be on sign up and then as well. they probably got quite high exposure as

334
00:33:12,305 --> 00:33:17,565
well or doing it. and you can reach these yourself.

335
00:33:17,565 --> 00:33:22,585
automobile industry. mostly because of the use of it right

336
00:33:22,585 --> 00:33:29,725
lining has been using some other places but that's where it comes loose.

337
00:33:29,725 --> 00:33:35,525
so I don't mess in the car and exposure. legal exposure in the US zero point one milliliter.

338
00:33:35,525 --> 00:33:40,825
you might wanna compare that with what exposures where to start in a different

339
00:33:40,825 --> 00:33:46,005
type job. so there's a study we might look at later. bye.

340
00:33:46,005 --> 00:33:52,725
and said that have lots of data about that exposure where they were making

341
00:33:52,725 --> 00:33:57,885
manufacturing textile. made it and they had a huge mix.

342
00:33:57,885 --> 00:34:03,225
and this is Sean you said is saying that the typical exposure

343
00:34:03,225 --> 00:34:08,245
that workers are working around that. we're been exposed to the further than

344
00:34:08,245 --> 00:34:13,737
one thing but before control Mike it's Ben. two hundred to three and fifty times

345
00:34:13,737 --> 00:34:18,796
now. what is considered a cut off. to prevent most cancers from a

346
00:34:18,796 --> 00:34:24,977
parent. so the story people have really massive exposure is based on what we know about

347
00:34:24,977 --> 00:34:30,096
potential that health outcomes or even higher

348
00:34:30,096 --> 00:34:35,656
as you see with mixing asbestos in that.

349
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:40,996
so if you this is talking more about what's in building fidelity

350
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:46,036
we mentioned the condition it's in. whether people can get to it it's in the basement room that

351
00:34:46,036 --> 00:34:51,076
blocked off. obviously things like patterns to verify whether it's likely to be disturbed. I think

352
00:34:51,076 --> 00:34:57,616
you would pay attention to. we talked about the health the fax already.

353
00:34:57,616 --> 00:35:03,336
so you'll notice that we you know. essentially there's been data

354
00:35:03,336 --> 00:35:08,636
saying it's Beth this is has it at your house. the fibrosis was recognized as a problem.

355
00:35:08,636 --> 00:35:13,813
even before the lung cancer was and this

356
00:35:13,813 --> 00:35:18,833
is just point out. you don't say someone has that. just

357
00:35:18,833 --> 00:35:24,093
because you can say they have fires the positive long

358
00:35:24,093 --> 00:35:29,473
parking lots cleared. you mentioned you had have some kind of disease state. something happened

359
00:35:29,473 --> 00:35:34,693
to Continental testers and so classic way matter

360
00:35:34,693 --> 00:35:39,792
from. so we'll talk on Thursday classic. it

361
00:35:39,792 --> 00:35:44,893
was only a test this is possible for this non-

362
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:49,973
malignant lung disease. you expect the restrictive on Thursday. you

363
00:35:49,973 --> 00:35:55,673
know decrease it easy. so but

364
00:35:55,673 --> 00:36:01,673
probably much for. recently you see a mixed picture. which sometimes

365
00:36:01,673 --> 00:36:07,113
may dominate and the reason that it is that the people are most likely

366
00:36:07,113 --> 00:36:12,190
is our problems and get them earlier. people have a double way people are both we're both

367
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:17,210
around. I'll figure it and the

368
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:22,510
car smoking cigarette has a tendency to call abstract as long as we talked about chronic obstructed

369
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:27,930
pulmonary disease. so the people you're most likely to see is the condition

370
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:33,370
because they're having problems. who have had lots of exposure to start. they

371
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:38,510
are not always but they're likely to be the people who don't smoke cigarettes

372
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:43,570
because they're just like to have problems with their lungs in general.

373
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:48,570
primary symptom is shortness of breath you may have dry call from

374
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:54,550
this time and if we are to mention restriction

375
00:36:54,550 --> 00:37:00,070
and we look at this last time. this is looking at decrease

376
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:05,990
fusion capacity deficit help desk asking across the basement membrane. it

377
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:11,190
is associated if you do body body box for your measuring after long as I

378
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:16,385
say with decreased total long capacity.

379
00:37:16,385 --> 00:37:21,584
okay. there is a long wait to see. usually for all the three major

380
00:37:21,584 --> 00:37:27,125
diseases. as a punk answer meet with you we and

381
00:37:27,125 --> 00:37:32,344
said some extent the pencil and Cassidy. more intense exposures the question shortly.

382
00:37:32,344 --> 00:37:37,544
but typically the late in Seaford. as this poses when someone is actually diagnosed with

383
00:37:37,544 --> 00:37:43,044
having lung diseases. again interference their breathing is more than twenty years after they commence

384
00:37:43,044 --> 00:37:49,365
to have an exposure. it's not really treatable.

385
00:37:49,365 --> 00:37:54,604
and even if you remove the part of exposure. it is nine three five four

386
00:37:54,604 --> 00:37:59,664
to progress to get work. as I mentioned a couple times now.

387
00:37:59,664 --> 00:38:04,664
they just call through to for the body system to clear up

388
00:38:04,664 --> 00:38:10,324
this month and deposit in the lungs and so it's probably continues to have

389
00:38:10,324 --> 00:38:15,489
future problems. so you. the clinical management includes things like

390
00:38:15,489 --> 00:38:21,428
that. so if you have somebody had exposure and also

391
00:38:21,428 --> 00:38:26,469
high. they got smoker. they're great

392
00:38:26,469 --> 00:38:31,729
candidate for trying to monitor them to cats. lung cancer malignancy very

393
00:38:31,729 --> 00:38:36,768
early. which you can do it. I'll talk to you little CT scan just now

394
00:38:36,768 --> 00:38:42,068
proving it in the harvest population. they were doing because you like to catch the cancer.

395
00:38:42,068 --> 00:38:47,148
much earlier and therefore have

396
00:38:47,148 --> 00:38:53,508
a greater potential for cheering the lung cancer.

397
00:38:53,508 --> 00:38:58,588
I mentioned the fact of floral thinking. this is description what they typically look

398
00:38:58,588 --> 00:39:04,388
like. unless you finish and you probably don't need to know all of this.

399
00:39:04,388 --> 00:39:09,648
it's Friday now most of it arrive at all. which means the lining up the chest

400
00:39:09,648 --> 00:39:15,074
cavity as opposed to

401
00:39:15,074 --> 00:39:20,234
is a code. looking about this real floor as well. remember it is five

402
00:39:20,234 --> 00:39:25,435
past each other engine in here on Excel.

403
00:39:25,435 --> 00:39:30,455
it's common. we are talk about the fact that it is's

404
00:39:30,455 --> 00:39:35,554
signal exposure goes and maybe last time sense to go started.

405
00:39:35,554 --> 00:39:44,274
but usually itself doesn't cause problems.

406
00:39:44,274 --> 00:39:49,697
okay. bye this is Bonnie this is Martha to point out the fact

407
00:39:49,697 --> 00:39:54,816
what happens is it. in case but after five or stay on the line

408
00:39:54,816 --> 00:39:59,876
for they can stay there for a long time. this

409
00:39:59,876 --> 00:40:06,116
is just a photograph of that. and this is showing you because

410
00:40:06,116 --> 00:40:12,016
you are still around a little bit. if you wanna look in people as long as that autopsy

411
00:40:12,016 --> 00:40:17,417
in the general population you could find a few best fibers. but that's about it.

412
00:40:17,417 --> 00:40:22,476
in case fibers but probably not enough to cause any measurable disease.

413
00:40:22,476 --> 00:40:27,476
but as you can see. they can be astronomical a

414
00:40:27,476 --> 00:40:33,476
higher than the general population. so as a matter that

415
00:40:33,476 --> 00:40:38,616
has lung cancer. going back to nineteen

416
00:40:38,616 --> 00:40:43,756
thirty. and it doesn't come to Clarendon. I'm

417
00:40:43,756 --> 00:40:48,842
from it. that this might meet the viewing on that that can be different time

418
00:40:48,842 --> 00:40:53,902
lung cancer that you get from other cousins as well like cigarettes and

419
00:40:53,902 --> 00:40:59,001
it's not really very surprising. the bottom paragraph there I think you all know that. quarter

420
00:40:59,001 --> 00:41:04,021
to twelve on the tenth date and duration exposure. I'll wait to see how long the

421
00:41:04,021 --> 00:41:09,062
exposure start. peaks at thirty

422
00:41:09,062 --> 00:41:14,342
thirty five years. pretty long wait and see. we don't think we think exposure

423
00:41:14,342 --> 00:41:19,842
is zero let's say. although it's hard to prove that but we

424
00:41:19,842 --> 00:41:25,281
you know probably any exposure increases your risk slightly.

425
00:41:25,281 --> 00:41:30,462
and I mentioned that. even it's free for one month to have exposure like some of the people

426
00:41:30,462 --> 00:41:36,102
work during over to complete your increase risk for lung cancer. so this is just a diagram

427
00:41:36,102 --> 00:41:41,622
showing you that about late and see a fax of this is number of years and subsequent

428
00:41:41,622 --> 00:41:47,122
onset of exposure. so this will be the number of years blatantly. this is for thousand

429
00:41:47,122 --> 00:41:52,958
person years and this is what you would expect for a lung cancer death in the general population

430
00:41:52,958 --> 00:41:58,198
compared to what you might observe in a population it's been very heavily exposed to as best

431
00:41:58,198 --> 00:42:03,558
as you notice it doesn't really take off to medically to your more than twenty years.

432
00:42:03,558 --> 00:42:10,078
so sponsored exposure. so again it's latency

433
00:42:10,078 --> 00:42:16,877
there tomorrow thinking of a pack of cigarette smoke and I believe the diagram coming up regarding talked about that

434
00:42:16,877 --> 00:42:21,897
treatment is in any different and improving. especially if

435
00:42:21,897 --> 00:42:27,097
you catch a very early like I talked about before. but in general. I'd

436
00:42:27,097 --> 00:42:33,058
love to answer. tenth have a bad five year fatality great.

437
00:42:33,058 --> 00:42:38,198
so this is from. this is data from you several times like this I talked about

438
00:42:38,198 --> 00:42:43,978
a different one but this is Dana from Scotty. that was looking at.

439
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:49,976
have exposed like installation workers and this message is being used and comparing.

440
00:42:49,976 --> 00:42:55,976
never smokers the people also smoked to have a great. and this is about what we talked about last time

441
00:42:55,976 --> 00:43:01,375
you said failed to take the increase minutes. this is roughly five fold

442
00:43:01,375 --> 00:43:06,375
an increase risk and figure out which is roughly ten or eleven folks and you more_or_less have_to

443
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:14,615
modify them together. if you got the rest is gonna be for someone attend both exposures.

444
00:43:14,615 --> 00:43:19,815
I'm giving example was actually more than all. this is a tiny bit less. it's in that ball park.

445
00:43:19,815 --> 00:43:26,375
alright. and remember the arguments that first thing. well

446
00:43:26,375 --> 00:43:32,115
just because the person spoke to. you should you should not say I'm not gonna work you compensation

447
00:43:32,115 --> 00:43:38,996
because I think your lung cancer is because my work and saying that in fact

448
00:43:38,996 --> 00:43:44,095
because you have a background smoking. it's much more likely that

449
00:43:44,095 --> 00:43:49,978
have exposure. what to chew over tend up having on cancer.

450
00:43:49,978 --> 00:43:54,978
you know the difference. this is rate fifty three to about eleven. compare the

451
00:43:54,978 --> 00:44:00,337
difference is only five to one. in terms absolute rest. having both. make this message

452
00:44:00,337 --> 00:44:05,377
much more. still need to see

453
00:44:05,377 --> 00:44:10,577
you all actually got back about the nineteen sixties. we talked about it. where where

454
00:44:10,577 --> 00:44:15,637
it is. you need with this masters.

455
00:44:15,637 --> 00:44:21,438
all forms involved the project tiles lower risk.

456
00:44:21,438 --> 00:44:27,018
alright. first Rado Services.

457
00:44:27,018 --> 00:44:32,038
this is the same kind of diagram. looking at latency years and on site exposure.

458
00:44:32,038 --> 00:44:37,938
and this is looking Missus cereal. it was interesting. it's lots of prizes of sorrow

459
00:44:37,938 --> 00:44:43,797
chest cavity. live chest cavity. parents Neil is lying in the afternoon.

460
00:44:43,797 --> 00:44:49,875
so and what's believe. well I got it in for

461
00:44:49,875 --> 00:44:55,115
five hours or actually to be able to penetrate and go right through the diaphragm and

462
00:44:55,115 --> 00:45:00,115
up and you are Donald E and so there's actually quite. turns out

463
00:45:00,115 --> 00:45:05,236
it's actually quite substantial risk parents and he'll meet

464
00:45:05,236 --> 00:45:11,595
with you later on. if you see it not just for. okay. and that seventy from Jeff.

465
00:45:11,595 --> 00:45:17,115
Jeff said it never would never see the actual hurting

466
00:45:17,115 --> 00:45:22,256
it hurts me. it's because it's contained within the TI track.

467
00:45:22,256 --> 00:45:27,496
usually doesn't penetrate as easily. so that we believe this is from innovation.

468
00:45:27,496 --> 00:45:32,676
not from in just as we mentioned it some other

469
00:45:32,676 --> 00:45:42,476
malignancy is in my car. and that's it. so any questions or comments about that

470
00:45:42,476 --> 00:45:47,885
thing I've been home that was built before nineteen seventy

471
00:45:47,885 --> 00:45:52,946
they might know what their personal situation is in that home. is there is that

472
00:45:52,946 --> 00:46:05,486
still present. it's in case. can you tell tell us anything about it.

473
00:46:05,486 --> 00:46:11,865
yeah I guess maybe not everything.

474
00:46:11,865 --> 00:46:17,426
anyway no comments on that. anyway thing on Wednesday.

475
00:46:17,426 --> 00:46:22,426
if you don't know you got Heidi my hot water pipe installation

476
00:46:22,426 --> 00:46:30,146
on you don't know that installation for you. really good idea

477
00:46:30,146 --> 00:46:39,426
and might be a good idea in case it is it's not case. yet.

478
00:46:39,426 --> 00:46:47,946
alright.

479
00:46:47,946 --> 00:46:53,286
see you. so he's sending up all. thanks. bye.

480
00:46:53,286 --> 00:46:58,666
alright. check it out. okay so now I got part about silica related

481
00:46:58,666 --> 00:47:03,825
disease and so

482
00:47:03,825 --> 00:47:09,006
we say to look. we mean free dioxide child

483
00:47:09,006 --> 00:47:14,506
to not okay. they don't call. the problem

484
00:47:14,506 --> 00:47:19,546
gonna talk about. but we have a_lot_of things I guess

485
00:47:19,546 --> 00:47:24,824
I will too and there's two categories. there's any more. so I last

486
00:47:24,824 --> 00:47:29,865
Wednesday. that is not really in a Chrisman form. that doesn't cost. so

487
00:47:29,865 --> 00:47:36,924
because it's another silver related problems. Kristen Farms. there's a problem.

488
00:47:36,924 --> 00:47:42,024
there's three forms to print and fill at court. bye. part

489
00:47:42,024 --> 00:47:47,084
of our comment but there's a substantial amount of crystals light tree tonight.

490
00:47:47,084 --> 00:47:52,084
so the temperature is Crystal Clark. I can't remember if we contacted. but if

491
00:47:52,084 --> 00:47:59,644
you still up to about a little bit more positive in your abilities in dues problems like on the

492
00:47:59,644 --> 00:48:05,084
road. then the course is you know for now and he'll

493
00:48:05,084 --> 00:48:10,304
put all of them can because the problem.

494
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:16,824
it's hard to get away from that file too. it's everywhere in there.

495
00:48:16,824 --> 00:48:21,984
where I talked I talked about you know Sandy beaches. we plan on off Mosley

496
00:48:21,984 --> 00:48:27,982
Court. but most people gets a little closer from part two. for ticket two.

497
00:48:27,982 --> 00:48:33,802
to decline the problem.

498
00:48:33,802 --> 00:48:38,942
it's often with other man. so that they don't die. what's

499
00:48:38,942 --> 00:48:44,063
bad about that the court people online to get things like gold and

500
00:48:44,063 --> 00:48:49,542
copper platinum. so there are issues with this to look at it. present

501
00:48:49,542 --> 00:48:54,782
my is done. people working over time it's not online. depending on exactly

502
00:48:54,782 --> 00:48:59,982
what the constitution or how done. very substantial risk for developing silk related disease

503
00:48:59,982 --> 00:49:05,162
like sewer coasters. I mentioned already

504
00:49:05,162 --> 00:49:10,682
that disaster that's early in the US and some of the first application

505
00:49:10,682 --> 00:49:15,722
how. we're you had enormous numbers of people dying

506
00:49:15,722 --> 00:49:21,002
quickly to fill it out. this study is

507
00:49:21,002 --> 00:49:26,015
addressing the relationship between Philip exposure and add her outcome from

508
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:31,535
from from Granite Quarry in workers and many people making Greystone.

509
00:49:31,535 --> 00:49:36,535
because they're pretty much exposed to it and not much else. not a big problem. praise

510
00:49:36,535 --> 00:49:43,435
the blast. love you. this is

511
00:49:43,435 --> 00:49:48,495
not something. send it out for.

512
00:49:48,495 --> 00:49:53,655
so suppose you have like any. you can get it. you can get lead poisoning until

513
00:49:53,655 --> 00:49:59,375
potential exposure all the same time. doing both. so like a_lot_of bridges

514
00:49:59,375 --> 00:50:04,495
still have highlighted content hang around because it's very weather resistance and it's

515
00:50:04,495 --> 00:50:09,615
only wanna repaint the bridge. you know the way that you typically wanna remove that. doing

516
00:50:09,615 --> 00:50:14,735
sand blasting it's way faster than doing something like

517
00:50:14,735 --> 00:50:19,838
that many times chemical Richie what are you doing

518
00:50:19,838 --> 00:50:25,219
Sandra. you said because it's high energy. you gonna break

519
00:50:25,219 --> 00:50:30,918
up the particles. they there about nothing critical strike. I need.

520
00:50:30,918 --> 00:50:35,918
and you get end up with the sizes and then hang on to the phone right. but the

521
00:50:35,918 --> 00:50:41,298
issue which. and there are other things people use these days

522
00:50:41,298 --> 00:50:46,658
like I was in a bunch other. but there are a little bit more expensive than I

523
00:50:46,658 --> 00:50:51,918
thought to using glass manufacturing and a number

524
00:50:51,918 --> 00:50:59,979
of other things actually to be familiar with the second one on the list because

525
00:50:59,979 --> 00:51:05,338
we're having communication people on right

526
00:51:05,338 --> 00:51:10,999
when you came out. yeah Reginald eight eighty.

527
00:51:10,999 --> 00:51:16,298
I actually was one of the people working with Joy with United automobile workers

528
00:51:16,298 --> 00:51:21,318
in Ford_Motor_Company. to help him put together

529
00:51:21,318 --> 00:51:27,018
information about potential happens and how the boys and your court.

530
00:51:27,018 --> 00:51:32,338
it's very very broad. there's like a_lot_of different exposures and one of the biggest

531
00:51:32,338 --> 00:51:37,458
problems I had was with making things like engines. would

532
00:51:37,458 --> 00:51:43,178
you do by pouring multi metal and to send them all

533
00:51:43,178 --> 00:51:48,338
together with and then getting the engine and saying well it's a little

534
00:51:48,338 --> 00:51:53,538
better than that it is. so we're gonna take the power tool and grind it out

535
00:51:53,538 --> 00:52:00,058
and that creates very fine for taking it to be healthy please

536
00:52:00,058 --> 00:52:06,759
start me in the US is a big issue in.

537
00:52:06,759 --> 00:52:12,198
Brian Sam blast you get your jeans look the way you want them to look.

538
00:52:12,198 --> 00:52:17,979
so currently we have not a big issue going on

539
00:52:17,979 --> 00:52:23,650
hydraulic fracture in operations are from asking wait to release

540
00:52:23,650 --> 00:52:28,811
natural gas from things like shield deposit and so on.

541
00:52:28,811 --> 00:52:34,210
that's like one of the reasons the US is that much more self sufficient

542
00:52:34,210 --> 00:52:39,351
date it was in the past with respect to the oil and gas and this

543
00:52:39,351 --> 00:52:44,611
is pointing out that in part of the process

544
00:52:44,611 --> 00:52:49,750
for you. lots of sand and they again use high energy

545
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:54,950
on it. and so here's here's an area where people are actually working. you can see this cloud

546
00:52:54,950 --> 00:53:00,272
of gas lot. actually Crystal Court probably

547
00:53:00,272 --> 00:53:05,412
and here someone is that we measured twenty seven times. the permits

548
00:53:05,412 --> 00:53:10,692
both but if you limit the legal limit. in is relatively new

549
00:53:10,692 --> 00:53:15,813
enterprise.

550
00:53:15,813 --> 00:53:21,032
so it's. people cancel because it's a long time. going way back. I

551
00:53:21,032 --> 00:53:26,032
had mention it's the mechanical tools and processes that greatly increased exposure

552
00:53:26,032 --> 00:53:31,232
and all kinds of dust control measures. you want things where.

553
00:53:31,232 --> 00:53:37,332
if you can substituting things like steel shot and blasting instead of using the sand

554
00:53:37,332 --> 00:53:42,452
and engineering controls personal protective equipment. so you several kinds

555
00:53:42,452 --> 00:53:49,172
of diseases related to Philip. Philip process this there's sort of

556
00:53:49,172 --> 00:53:54,252
classical solo process and then what's called complicated. so call whether still

557
00:53:54,252 --> 00:53:59,352
process is progressing gotten much worse. another thing it's very important to know about

558
00:53:59,352 --> 00:54:06,114
to two important if you working on a middle income country. is that

559
00:54:06,114 --> 00:54:11,134
happened. so. but there's pretty good evidence and just having an hell of a_lot. so

560
00:54:11,134 --> 00:54:16,213
look at your work. even though you don't have the fibrosis. put you at

561
00:54:16,213 --> 00:54:23,493
increase risk for having questions and be able to

562
00:54:23,493 --> 00:54:29,453
substantially increase risk. so for example

563
00:54:29,453 --> 00:54:35,394
I was involved in time. Howard Myers.

564
00:54:35,394 --> 00:54:40,553
five five four and they have

565
00:54:40,553 --> 00:54:45,594
been doing mine for decades and decades and as matter fact

566
00:54:45,594 --> 00:54:50,773
it was a set up with the company there's actually a couple now Institute.

567
00:54:50,773 --> 00:54:57,473
responsible for screen. we're getting

568
00:54:57,473 --> 00:55:04,916
ready to happen. so business.

569
00:55:04,916 --> 00:55:11,515
you can work with people that have CE or call.

570
00:55:11,515 --> 00:55:16,615
see answer the phone please. Sandy

571
00:55:16,615 --> 00:55:21,615
un- here to Burger losses.

572
00:55:21,615 --> 00:55:26,676
you know well we we

573
00:55:26,676 --> 00:55:31,775
found the phone quite well they're interest. which

574
00:55:31,775 --> 00:55:39,196
is. if you Suzanne. I don't know. everyone knows about HR.

575
00:55:39,196 --> 00:55:44,396
Department here I got my charger in another country and

576
00:55:44,396 --> 00:55:49,855
HIV. so and you know

577
00:55:49,855 --> 00:55:54,896
eight H Group. say twenty thirty in

578
00:55:54,896 --> 00:56:00,547
the mail. you probably had it high. they have e-mail at fifteen

579
00:56:00,547 --> 00:56:06,967
sometime. anyway we're twenty percent of core

580
00:56:06,967 --> 00:56:12,948
regarding her for being HIV positive which is substantial restaurant having

581
00:56:12,948 --> 00:56:18,907
breakfast or function issue with

582
00:56:18,907 --> 00:56:24,367
the main reason that is associated with expert. this is

583
00:56:24,367 --> 00:56:30,208
Victor potter with important part of defense against America. it actually

584
00:56:30,208 --> 00:56:35,367
the next five to pull those which is that are supposed to break things

585
00:56:35,367 --> 00:56:40,927
down. they can't break it down in the end of time. so what we're seeing

586
00:56:40,927 --> 00:56:46,987
if you went through from May

587
00:56:46,987 --> 00:56:52,427
early two thousand eight Chevy directly

588
00:56:52,427 --> 00:56:58,127
to a conference area. went from very long quite substantial. the

589
00:56:58,127 --> 00:57:03,290
risk of developing the risk of developing bill process your cell because this

590
00:57:03,290 --> 00:57:08,849
is unchanged at that time. it was too high. not much is been done about it but it was unchanged.

591
00:57:08,849 --> 00:57:14,030
but the market went up

592
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:20,149
ten small little bit more than that. which

593
00:57:20,149 --> 00:57:25,429
you know whether you had double laminate

594
00:57:25,429 --> 00:57:31,449
and that they were being exposed to the Celica which is defeating in your system and reserve your spot.

595
00:57:31,449 --> 00:57:37,929
this is really a substantial restrictive

596
00:57:37,929 --> 00:57:44,169
lung cancer I think this work bye. talk a little later.

597
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:50,709
the reason for cancer. you know friend.

598
00:57:50,709 --> 00:57:57,268
now says that it's approved. you

599
00:57:57,268 --> 00:58:02,887
so just be aware that I'm gonna process for the fall.

600
00:58:02,887 --> 00:58:10,167
so if it falls in a five thousand cable. monkey.

601
00:58:10,167 --> 00:58:15,708
how are you. where you're talking about. even

602
00:58:15,708 --> 00:58:20,808
with very high exposure. most might be in order one and a half two fold

603
00:58:20,808 --> 00:58:26,268
increases. where. you can have easily five

604
00:58:26,268 --> 00:58:31,328
or more increases. so certainly true. I I believe

605
00:58:31,328 --> 00:58:37,068
it. so the focus can do phone cancer and him not

606
00:58:37,068 --> 00:58:42,228
time the actual exposure occurred her. as it

607
00:58:42,228 --> 00:58:47,688
is is that Saturday instead of another weird thing in common.

608
00:58:47,688 --> 00:58:53,308
you need this is the King concert Saturday. really tired on Friday. bye.

609
00:58:53,308 --> 00:58:58,868
call you back in just couple other one so I had done

610
00:58:58,868 --> 00:59:04,808
in packs that are outside the respiratory track system itself. so

611
00:59:04,808 --> 00:59:13,108
about this. this is. I'm not gonna quiz you on this

612
00:59:13,108 --> 00:59:20,408
data. I was up there with the chest x-ray looks like I don't think you know that.

613
00:59:20,408 --> 00:59:25,427
what you should know is that you can. if it gets

614
00:59:25,427 --> 00:59:31,468
worse. you can start forming. large still kind of nodules. so this is

615
00:59:31,468 --> 00:59:36,916
Michael Graff you know one of these in the long and

616
00:59:36,916 --> 00:59:42,510
when you reach that stage when you get to what's called early Eva this is early but when you get to complicated

617
00:59:42,510 --> 00:59:47,590
soon because then you have much more. anyway.

618
00:59:47,590 --> 00:59:52,670
health problems. so if that settles on top. you don't have them done yet.

619
00:59:52,670 --> 01:00:00,170
he's in lease early to if might be normal on a chest x-ray CDs or capacity.

620
01:00:00,170 --> 01:00:06,490
if it's not complicated and it's just my father. call me.

621
01:00:06,490 --> 01:00:11,490
just calling about the shortness of Brad. the complaint. but I

622
01:00:11,490 --> 01:00:16,730
dropped off and if it's if you or Mike's e-mail restriction that you and surprise

623
01:00:16,730 --> 01:00:21,910
at this point. but if if you stayed at the hotel because it may not affect

624
01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:26,990
your life expectancy or art function. here's more descriptions

625
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:32,370
or at radio graphic for teachers. so the thing that

626
01:00:32,370 --> 01:00:38,807
highlight the importance of the situation that

627
01:00:38,807 --> 01:00:44,027
human body have a_lot_of trouble hearing Christmas from the law.

628
01:00:44,027 --> 01:00:49,227
in this case doesn't matter. I just can't do this post to. those quite people. even ask you remove

629
01:00:49,227 --> 01:00:54,247
someone from exposure. you maybe to see that they have till the close is based on the chest x-ray but they're not

630
01:00:54,247 --> 01:01:00,707
something that I can have a normal function. you remove the number. bye. bye-bye.

631
01:01:00,707 --> 01:01:06,427
be here tonight. this is

632
01:01:06,427 --> 01:01:12,787
sorry typical chest x-ray and all these little dogs everywhere. examples.

633
01:01:12,787 --> 01:01:17,907
this is pass I need to tend to see what's to look. also

634
01:01:17,907 --> 01:01:23,087
the highlight no rain along the chest. to come in large

635
01:01:23,087 --> 01:01:28,667
because they've reactions of the silica. so it's complicated you get a call.

636
01:01:28,667 --> 01:01:34,427
the last I saw the little nozzle start coming together and you end up with these great big and cooperation.

637
01:01:34,427 --> 01:01:40,473
and you actually have a_lot_of distractions long tissue at that point usually for donnelly in upper loads

638
01:01:40,473 --> 01:01:45,593
and we got kinda distortion the long architecture then you can tend to become very

639
01:01:45,593 --> 01:01:51,893
symptomatic. shortness of breath. talk to companies next plan.

640
01:01:51,893 --> 01:01:57,913
you may have lots of impairment of your lung function. but it could be instructional restriction.

641
01:01:57,913 --> 01:02:03,173
and you actually all night. this is Paul Ryan

642
01:02:03,173 --> 01:02:08,233
Hart. through long because they need

643
01:02:08,233 --> 01:02:13,693
a_lot_of resistance the blood vessels as well. Paul Dorson.

644
01:02:13,693 --> 01:02:19,253
and so if you can get with Paul Clark. analysis this is not the left side.

645
01:02:19,253 --> 01:02:24,253
the rest your body right side of your heart. just pop in to the lawn. actually start to fail.

646
01:02:24,253 --> 01:02:33,033
because trying to high pressure because it

647
01:02:33,033 --> 01:02:38,425
right. so we are talked about this I think in details

648
01:02:38,425 --> 01:02:44,005
.com and this is Jay we talked about the map the five. that they just did but they

649
01:02:44,005 --> 01:02:49,265
destroyed. so I got to get to the.

650
01:02:49,265 --> 01:02:55,845
okay. so this is like the College Bridge Town disaster.

651
01:02:55,845 --> 01:03:01,485
you get a different picture. massive control exposure for slate.

652
01:03:01,485 --> 01:03:07,245
maybe worldwide. you should really speak with see there's any more.

653
01:03:07,245 --> 01:03:12,525
please tell her to I even left quite quickly

654
01:03:12,525 --> 01:03:17,785
and here you got all extra proteins along the air sack they're supposed

655
01:03:17,785 --> 01:03:22,825
be are filled with fluid and so on and you may not have anything else

656
01:03:22,825 --> 01:03:28,045
it looks like it. and so

657
01:03:28,045 --> 01:03:33,185
I told you that. so guys not now considered direct to the class one

658
01:03:33,185 --> 01:03:38,311
given her surgeon since nineteen ninety seven alright. any questions or comments

659
01:03:38,311 --> 01:03:43,511
about this. so even

660
01:03:43,511 --> 01:03:48,591
here in Michigan. they're still quite a few workers than

661
01:03:48,591 --> 01:03:53,631
enough time.

662
01:03:53,631 --> 01:04:01,571
you know there are jobs job. Sam blasting. made not the other control we're still getting.

663
01:04:01,571 --> 01:04:08,071
alright so coworkers name Connie else is

664
01:04:08,071 --> 01:04:15,451
Paul Minard. this is a character six five three five product line disease.

665
01:04:15,451 --> 01:04:20,691
yes large Airways. so here were gonna have a disease that has

666
01:04:20,691 --> 01:04:26,211
it extracted. part two and apparently online still processing at this process

667
01:04:26,211 --> 01:04:33,251
which we normally don't have an extra component to

668
01:04:33,251 --> 01:04:38,717
test related to see so this is definition.

669
01:04:38,717 --> 01:04:45,357
legal definition for the black one with the this is actually because of the United

670
01:04:45,357 --> 01:04:50,897
mine work as many of mine going back to

671
01:04:50,897 --> 01:04:56,177
their family. I've did a_lot_of organizing around it trying to get

672
01:04:56,177 --> 01:05:01,677
benefit for minors that we're getting you know and soon as you can see the interview. that is

673
01:05:01,677 --> 01:05:06,697
past nineteen seventy seven. so if you have you should black lung disease

674
01:05:06,697 --> 01:05:11,697
is a chronic disease along the rising of employment and underground line. that's gonna be

675
01:05:11,697 --> 01:05:16,877
coming apart in a moment. we gonna tell you about how it's now recognize.

676
01:05:16,877 --> 01:05:22,797
you would notice if you were. if you read this article that came with a coworker his name.

677
01:05:22,797 --> 01:05:28,257
now recognize that there's a variety lime disease associated with

678
01:05:28,257 --> 01:05:33,277
exposure to calls us working your call. not just classical

679
01:05:33,277 --> 01:05:38,315
coworkers named Connie hello cover that and the second.

680
01:05:38,315 --> 01:05:43,955
so but. so that definition can capture

681
01:05:43,955 --> 01:05:48,995
things that weren't recognize. originally

682
01:05:48,995 --> 01:05:54,675
I call right. makes a difference. maybe

683
01:05:54,675 --> 01:05:59,835
not worth knowing that it does it then just if you have part of it call

684
01:05:59,835 --> 01:06:04,915
higher right. call burns more effectively. if this thing does your higher risk

685
01:06:04,915 --> 01:06:09,995
for developing the name of Connie houses and this is showing you different names of different types.

686
01:06:09,995 --> 01:06:15,933
call them or I'll just either going from the lowest rank to the highest bank

687
01:06:15,933 --> 01:06:21,073
and this is Shane with a major call deposit from United_States. Lost

688
01:06:21,073 --> 01:06:26,113
in Appalachia. but other than quite a bit out west but also there's. I

689
01:06:26,113 --> 01:06:31,513
was in very Illinois part of Indiana.

690
01:06:31,513 --> 01:06:36,533
alright. so these days with the Jeff. he

691
01:06:36,533 --> 01:06:41,733
talked about. call nine one busy Z C

692
01:06:41,733 --> 01:06:46,933
N D L D. because as I mentioned it's now again it's not recognizing.

693
01:06:46,933 --> 01:06:52,073
there's more different kinds of lung disease that can occur. so simple classical color

694
01:06:52,073 --> 01:06:57,213
is not Connie Nelson. there's a complicated forward. calling

695
01:06:57,213 --> 01:07:02,413
out this out. you that process. they shared a_lot. just

696
01:07:02,413 --> 01:07:07,613
like the simple thought process and complicated hotel. so another semi sort

697
01:07:07,613 --> 01:07:12,613
of issue here that you can get a very significant distortion of

698
01:07:12,613 --> 01:07:17,664
the lung tissue lots of long tissue C W P Progressive

699
01:07:17,664 --> 01:07:22,804
Master fibrosis. but in addition this. it's recognize that you have something

700
01:07:22,804 --> 01:07:28,344
this call. test related to few side brothers that I have any great big bottles

701
01:07:28,344 --> 01:07:33,804
and Darshan. you may have just general fibrosis

702
01:07:33,804 --> 01:07:38,884
is pregnant. there's different shades of a pass to the classic the

703
01:07:38,884 --> 01:07:43,924
people used to say that call. related to El_Paso knees and chest x-rays. have

704
01:07:43,924 --> 01:07:49,584
a rounded up area and are mostly in the middle and upper. love you.

705
01:07:49,584 --> 01:07:54,644
bye. if you just wan it often looks more like many

706
01:07:54,644 --> 01:07:59,664
years. okay. the reason it may affect the entire long and you. you

707
01:07:59,664 --> 01:08:06,344
can also get larger pass to be present in the long

708
01:08:06,344 --> 01:08:11,344
form. it's related to run entire arthritis it's a form it's called many times long it's actually

709
01:08:11,344 --> 01:08:17,032
partly an auto community. in relation to what's been and hail.

710
01:08:17,032 --> 01:08:22,152
so simple carpeting coming up this year. bye.

711
01:08:22,152 --> 01:08:29,212
Nigel Mac you know small ones and Nigel. I

712
01:08:29,212 --> 01:08:34,212
usually don't have a_lot_of symptoms of fifty Avenue Alice is. all you have unless you

713
01:08:34,212 --> 01:08:39,352
smoke or as well. so I made progress

714
01:08:39,352 --> 01:08:44,452
but he tells he need to monitor more carefully. we can't treat nine. Connie six can

715
01:08:44,452 --> 01:08:49,552
we actually treat well. but again complicated.

716
01:08:49,552 --> 01:08:55,392
this is when you get these larger nozzles call that thing rolling and and you can

717
01:08:55,392 --> 01:09:00,572
get involved everywhere and you get a distraction of air ways to structure

718
01:09:00,572 --> 01:09:06,272
the blood vessels. when you have much more serious diseases.

719
01:09:06,272 --> 01:09:11,312
you can have very substantial. no longer function. and usually want

720
01:09:11,312 --> 01:09:16,526
to get this bad it's gonna continue to progress and frequently this is get

721
01:09:16,526 --> 01:09:21,746
disabled people. again. to continue working with minor even. anyway I'll be at five

722
01:09:21,746 --> 01:09:26,806
two. Austin can't do so the easiest you need to tell you where clean up around

723
01:09:26,806 --> 01:09:32,626
the house that kinda thing taking a short walk on level ground and Jordan's her life expectancy.

724
01:09:32,626 --> 01:09:38,726
we don't have a specific therapy. so this this file talking about.

725
01:09:38,726 --> 01:09:44,026
call Chris Newman Kania. this is in cigarettes and bronchitis. so this Stacy.

726
01:09:44,026 --> 01:09:49,746
so that definition that's up there.

727
01:09:49,746 --> 01:09:55,226
you got any questions you about the report.

728
01:09:55,226 --> 01:10:00,746
having problems close together three or more months year or two years or more. you say.

729
01:10:00,746 --> 01:10:06,346
okay they have the five crime press five. and

730
01:10:06,346 --> 01:10:11,526
if you have that you often have good player who is shortness of breath and you also have

731
01:10:11,526 --> 01:10:16,754
abnormal fifties very frequently and it's one of the two entities

732
01:10:16,754 --> 01:10:21,874
are together. make chronic instructor pulmonary disease and record the other one is let's refer to

733
01:10:21,874 --> 01:10:28,814
enough. that's really a diagnosis of the autopsy. so and you can only make calls. bye.

734
01:10:28,814 --> 01:10:33,994
okay. so you know it's tidy most common cause of chronic

735
01:10:33,994 --> 01:10:39,714
bronchitis a cigarette smoking. cold up exposure is quite clearly rate factor.

736
01:10:39,714 --> 01:10:44,714
the significant rate factor and it's an C W P.

737
01:10:44,714 --> 01:10:50,034
full blown is not chronic bronchitis. has always changes. have_to change

738
01:10:50,034 --> 01:10:55,194
it. so it be hard to separate the reason reason.

739
01:10:55,194 --> 01:11:00,354
please five years. which again. I just wanna give you a prayer that this is gonna be quite

740
01:11:00,354 --> 01:11:05,594
contentious. right what happens. I got a testing from

741
01:11:05,594 --> 01:11:13,934
product from Highland. gimme a call nine twenty five years. know.

742
01:11:13,934 --> 01:11:19,154
this is grandma Pat. I have_to tell you something. and so that sort of legal

743
01:11:19,154 --> 01:11:24,394
issues that come up. like the case is you gonna be looking at the account.

744
01:11:24,394 --> 01:11:29,854
well you diagnosed probably bronchitis. so we expect that from

745
01:11:29,854 --> 01:11:35,714
coworkers need to call me up. second call is it really just calling to figure out. so your

746
01:11:35,714 --> 01:11:41,634
employer is doesn't have responsibility. okay.

747
01:11:41,634 --> 01:11:46,794
and this is saying that even among people that aren't cigarette smokers it's actually

748
01:11:46,794 --> 01:11:52,214
not uncommon to see. thanks. what would be diagnosis chronic bronchitis a rising.

749
01:11:52,214 --> 01:11:57,914
just because of the cold exposure. I called up classified

750
01:11:57,914 --> 01:12:03,634
with in terms of cars with University human. okay.

751
01:12:03,634 --> 01:12:08,774
so you might wanna read what it says out there. so as

752
01:12:08,774 --> 01:12:14,096
you can see it you start reading. this is quite

753
01:12:14,096 --> 01:12:20,136
see you. alright. so I was actually Bob was doing study.

754
01:12:20,136 --> 01:12:25,516
you all updated and collected by the National. talk to you soon.

755
01:12:25,516 --> 01:12:30,576
nine fifty. Union. trying to look at. you asked about

756
01:12:30,576 --> 01:12:35,756
the relationship between especially early exposure and advertisement.

757
01:12:35,756 --> 01:12:40,856
it's very healthy. so we had all the update and I have_to explain

758
01:12:40,856 --> 01:12:46,076
you how this works. so the way things used to work for. because didn't know

759
01:12:46,076 --> 01:12:51,156
that this is an issue.. if this is

760
01:12:51,156 --> 01:12:56,714
the first. like you know some of my filter battery that seven

761
01:12:56,714 --> 01:13:02,354
two seven eight here all of our goals. you can calculate how much

762
01:13:02,354 --> 01:13:08,394
rent and help her to meet her there. alright.

763
01:13:08,394 --> 01:13:13,554
so we have the data and

764
01:13:13,554 --> 01:13:18,694
we start you know. would you like to expose you later.

765
01:13:18,694 --> 01:13:25,114
typically if you have a care mind

766
01:13:25,114 --> 01:13:30,214
mind. you can call. bye.

767
01:13:30,214 --> 01:13:35,834
you know most likely answer. alright.

768
01:13:35,834 --> 01:13:41,434
it's Stacy Allen. five zero one. bye. on the other.

769
01:13:41,434 --> 01:13:46,934
and that you think it's not normal distribution but if you

770
01:13:46,934 --> 01:13:52,134
just take longer than normal distribution. okay.

771
01:13:52,134 --> 01:13:57,393
so we. so we love you and what we found was if you left.

772
01:13:57,393 --> 01:14:02,473
so little bit of the data collected by the enforcement officers.

773
01:14:02,473 --> 01:14:08,813
people representing and ship from the government. all of those samples.

774
01:14:08,813 --> 01:14:13,973
sorry for now. so you got like ten percent collected by the inspectors and ninety

775
01:14:13,973 --> 01:14:19,053
percent collected by the owners company. they tell someone to go do it and

776
01:14:19,053 --> 01:14:24,053
all but all the samples are and I live back in action. so if you want

777
01:14:24,053 --> 01:14:29,733
the inspector.

778
01:14:29,733 --> 01:14:34,733
he said that this is exactly what you can expect

779
01:14:34,733 --> 01:14:40,653
right tomorrow. you left by the company.

780
01:14:40,653 --> 01:14:45,813
it looks more like that me. if this is all have a great day.

781
01:14:45,813 --> 01:14:50,833
came down a little later. normal. and would you see

782
01:14:50,833 --> 01:14:56,013
a phone screen. basically what appeared to be going on because

783
01:14:56,013 --> 01:15:01,955
they could be signed and fine they were tracking. they doing great.

784
01:15:01,955 --> 01:15:07,915
just trying to make sure the exposure is lower and that and that included

785
01:15:07,915 --> 01:15:13,115
things like mine.

786
01:15:13,115 --> 01:15:20,255
go out there. bye. you need to call.

787
01:15:20,255 --> 01:15:26,055
so if you opened up the canister filter. leave

788
01:15:26,055 --> 01:15:32,995
one spot in the center the filter. it's very hard to explain. I'll talk to you soon. bye.

789
01:15:32,995 --> 01:15:38,195
this is Paul. bye. holler. because

790
01:15:38,195 --> 01:15:43,195
like companies are talking to each other about how to get all levels. so it was

791
01:15:43,195 --> 01:15:50,935
quite contentious. alright. so

792
01:15:50,935 --> 01:15:55,955
we actually have a study. anyway actually you know it enough inspector

793
01:15:55,955 --> 01:16:01,215
data that we could do at the matches and inspect the data at least compared to the

794
01:16:01,215 --> 01:16:06,595
company but the date it. thanks for much left didn't the legal course. alright.

795
01:16:06,595 --> 01:16:11,995
I saw the take away from that. she should be able to describe

796
01:16:11,995 --> 01:16:16,995
receipt five five. so I can call you know I should know

797
01:16:16,995 --> 01:16:22,075
but what I thought about you. using the keys and see what we know you should be aware of that.

798
01:16:22,075 --> 01:16:27,115
it's important to understand. you should know how explosion is likely to occur

799
01:16:27,115 --> 01:16:32,115
but on the nine way and which exposures cost problems and how that causes

800
01:16:32,115 --> 01:16:37,115
problems. you should understand if we should wait and see which comes up for

801
01:16:37,115 --> 01:16:42,275
all three of these and the issue of synergy with

802
01:16:42,275 --> 01:16:47,575
cigarettes. and if this is related diseases. and again that

803
01:16:47,575 --> 01:17:02,857
is. yeah

804
01:17:02,857 --> 01:17:07,857
well they could be considered for a_lot_of reasons might be a percentage and including song

805
01:17:07,857 --> 01:17:14,537
called I. I have. so look at it. okay. bye.

806
01:17:14,537 --> 01:17:19,917

808
01:17:25,117 --> 01:17:31,057
that. with this is at least a probable human person agent.

809
01:17:31,057 --> 01:17:36,077
the data for those other non- malignant diseases. simple topic to coworkers

810
01:17:36,077 --> 01:17:41,197
and I'm calling you as well. if you doubt this is about the fact that

811
01:17:41,197 --> 01:17:46,457
you can only from working at Home Line. crime classic

812
01:17:46,457 --> 01:17:51,737
chronic bronchitis. including reductions in Palmer's function testing even if you don't have_to you don't have_to

813
01:17:51,737 --> 01:17:57,157
be showing up in Chester. although this incident. well now this is

814
01:17:57,157 --> 01:18:02,297
