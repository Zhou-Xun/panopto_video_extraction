1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:05,650
I guess I just. I like it slightly.

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:10,730
It's on everyone else, especially now. You're going to be special.

3
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:19,060
So we're going to actually make it. We're going to go on the way on the rap sheet.

4
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:23,110
Okay. But okay, you know what? So whatever.

5
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,610
You can just go on Saturday by all of this.

6
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:31,920
Yeah, I think so.

7
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,290
And I work on being strong practice as possible.

8
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,050
Thank you. Yeah. Change.

9
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:55,500
Other than that, I was like, I decided I was like, you know, like, right now we're doing the trails or.

10
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:01,450
Or, like, Puerto Rico to be realistic. And I help.

11
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:05,520
Yeah, yeah, I know. I don't. I don't mean to laugh. I like,

12
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:10,139
but I think that really nice because it's like a and then there are like smallpox where people

13
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:21,540
can always remind you that you want to bring like two terms of business fitness going.

14
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:31,110
I think that'll be a deal. You find out later or something.

15
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:44,820
How are you? Great. Now, so our mental lexicon, that one is actually engineering this video, which I always figured out yesterday.

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,680
My concern for what? You know, she's going to smoke.

17
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:58,140
Yeah, I didn't really have I don't look at any. But it's like, you know, it's like I heard that.

18
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:09,990
Yeah, it's like like there was a time when she said, oh, I lost my appetite.

19
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:23,340
So I was like, I don't know, because, you know, not like she told, you know, I'm telling you.

20
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:33,060
But it was okay. Yeah, this one.

21
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:50,550
So I, I, I lost my business. So I went to work cause I just.

22
00:02:50,960 --> 00:03:00,330
I tried to look out of my mind, at least, like I had my doubts.

23
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:16,890
I was like, you know, not like I need time to talk to my professor.

24
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:23,460
Like, she's still struggling with this, I guess.

25
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,150
I don't know. She's really a textbook girl.

26
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:39,920
I don't think I feel like I can't even like because when I leave this conference and I'm like, no, I'm doing these things like,

27
00:03:41,070 --> 00:04:12,000
you know, just like me when I'm sitting here and I feel like I don't know why I started recording in progress.

28
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:49,500
Yeah. I feel like it's like extensions because I'm of up because I was literally, she said, which covers an enormous amount of allowances.

29
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,570
I don't probably need to ask that and we probably don't get it today.

30
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:04,330
Okay. Good morning, everybody. Good morning.

31
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:17,919
Let's continue our discussion about this issue of analysis and say as they go, this is going to be the last one on the last discussion papers.

32
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,040
And then we will start with precision trees.

33
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:32,610
On Thursday and until Thursday, you're going to get your weekend by midnight and you have a week to do so.

34
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:49,090
The families are going to be up in the morning and you can use all the time that you need from classmates or anybody, and you have to do it.

35
00:05:51,880 --> 00:06:09,660
So I'm going to. And so the honor code statement, he did sound so that he was signing a loan going to be very well received.

36
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,780
Any of them anyway. So that's under.

37
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:19,500
Okay. So now. Let's.

38
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,809
And what I'm going to do is we're going to talk to the women.

39
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:41,940
I talk to them about utility theory. And if you go to last week's session that had already been peer to.

40
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,760
So here we go. If you go to.

41
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:15,370
October six, session one. And then in October six session, you'll see a few files that we were going to be working with.

42
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,910
And this is we already finish homework four.

43
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:26,190
And this is the handouts that we use for the young people.

44
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:30,340
And this is what we're going to get some knowledge about utility theory.

45
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:39,760
And then we started I actually would finish homework five because I got two problems or one problem that is today.

46
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:48,970
So the home really is my biggest problem and I knew that and we did that.

47
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,530
We did. And that is that it's problem.

48
00:07:53,650 --> 00:08:08,740
And then all you need to do is to leave the management team and we did we guys the table so and that's the last night and then here

49
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:23,860
this is going to be downloading or installing and using position three and everything efficient tool suite that you already installed.

50
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:31,140
Those of you with with PCs and those working with mine then you will use the

51
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:37,500
group of rose business will very do a lot that they have to do so for you.

52
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:46,300
So now let's start it. Let's take a look at the utility theory.

53
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,740
So I'm going to start with an example.

54
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,130
So we get an idea of.

55
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:17,510
What we are doing when I open it is a spreadsheet and I am going to, let's say, do a state of make your two decisions as state of nature.

56
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:21,290
One, and this is going to be a cost table.

57
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:26,060
So what I would put in there on the table is just calls the whole thing.

58
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:34,580
So we want if we if we do the expected cost and I try to minimize the spectrum clause and so on and so forth.

59
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:42,980
So this is this issue of line releases decision to.

60
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:53,460
And then this is a state of nature one. And this is a state of attention to.

61
00:09:56,020 --> 00:10:02,080
Right. And your job is to decide which decision you're going to make now.

62
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:09,050
So because you have an uncertain future in this case, you know, they're probably right.

63
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:21,230
So they need to. Zoom in on this at this table and.

64
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:32,480
I am going to say that in this session, one, you have two, two chances.

65
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:39,580
You can either lose $50,000 or $80,000.

66
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:56,180
This is cost. All these costs, right? In the view of the view of the state of nature, one happened and you can just lose and say $500.

67
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:06,470
It is a state of the nature of the two parties. So those are those are the two possibilities.

68
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:16,070
Let's say that the possibility of you losing $50,000 is about 1%.

69
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:20,000
So this is 1% probability.

70
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:34,610
And then, of course, the 500 is simply 99% correct.

71
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:46,430
Okay. So now what would be the expected cost?

72
00:11:46,460 --> 00:12:00,630
So let me let me get this cost. You're going to hear them all.

73
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:08,530
There's been calls for the first one to be equal to the there's problem.

74
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:27,860
Oh, it. What we did is we the state of nature that was available in the right.

75
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:33,200
So we gather these pictures of these 995.

76
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:47,030
You know, you can either have that or position to do that.

77
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:53,810
Know, it doesn't matter what.

78
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:59,920
When? So those are those are the possibilities.

79
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:07,420
So you can and of course, think that closely is 1000 points.

80
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:18,500
Now the question really is you have to make a decision you make.

81
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:28,010
If you go for this course or spent in my study, my decision or your decision one or decision to.

82
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:44,760
Which one has a lower spectrum cost? One one having the lower two.

83
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:50,520
So if you go for expected cost, you'll go for this one, right?

84
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,640
So how many of you would go for decision in this case?

85
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,900
Not very many. Right. Because why?

86
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:04,440
Because you don't want the possibility of losing 5000 and $50,000.

87
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:10,080
So you better know $1,000, right?

88
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:18,810
Every year or whatever. Play with $40,000 rather than, you know, go to a game of channels.

89
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:29,000
Now you can get 500, you know, 500 with 99% chance or 50,000%.

90
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:39,380
So a lot of us would prefer to go to 40,000 just to avoid this major catastrophe.

91
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:45,240
And when you go for the thousands, what is that you are doing? How is that?

92
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:49,650
How is that, Cole? You know, what does that remind you?

93
00:14:49,830 --> 00:15:02,880
That table. This table is insurance, right?

94
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:06,390
So is insurance. That's how insurance is computed.

95
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:13,350
So you are willing to pay a little bit more of this vented cost to avoid big losses?

96
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:18,720
So when when?

97
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:26,670
So you have two areas that say, okay, you know, these are the state of nature that can happen.

98
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:39,750
It can happen to you. So our catastrophic so going on and then the expectation out of your risk group, your expectation is going to be 995 to it.

99
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:46,049
So what we're going to do is spread out the risk among everybody.

100
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:52,230
And instead of joining you, $985, which is the expected value.

101
00:15:52,980 --> 00:16:00,060
So it's so a very great saving. We're going to charge $5 more and that's our profit, right?

102
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:04,800
So in the insurance company, have to get some money out of them.

103
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:09,450
So that is the principle of insurance.

104
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:16,560
You are forgoing a little bit of cost.

105
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:27,210
I mean, you are following a little bit of benefit to remain to to get some assurance that you're not going to get any catastrophe.

106
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:33,689
You know, right now, run it.

107
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:45,150
You see that. If you see that, if you take the way that decision decision is, if you think decision to,

108
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:52,920
then you are not, you know, using the spent in monetary value respect that cause as your goal.

109
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:59,430
Right. So we already doing something else. So you are not you're saying, okay,

110
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:09,880
I want to minimize my aspect that then I will go for the one that's very risky so I will get a little bit more expectation.

111
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,770
Of course, has been patient and I'll pay a little bit more on average,

112
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:22,320
but I am never going to be I don't ever have to pay the if I do 50, something like that.

113
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:29,070
So health insurance or any kind of insurance. No.

114
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:46,010
No, it is not. This is why in the end, you are, you know, all the time make this issue of using blame, because I believe they use laws.

115
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:52,700
You know, they they have the is bent. They want to carry value in the cause.

116
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:57,760
They they they want to maximize the speculation in can.

117
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:04,580
But they also have to consider the risk associated with the decision that they make.

118
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:13,640
And when you me, when you make decisions and the risk, then you are, you know,

119
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:24,050
using the concept goal that we called in the decision making is, you see, what you were trying to do is maximize your utility.

120
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:28,920
It is your satisfaction about making a decision, right?

121
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:38,720
So people are going to be in their satisfaction increases proportionally as then, you know, to the money they make.

122
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:43,490
And they will be making decisions on their decision for the monetary value.

123
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:51,860
And so individuals will make decisions that will hedge against big losses.

124
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:57,340
And those what we call that we call risk categories, individuals.

125
00:18:57,350 --> 00:19:02,350
And we can actually measure the degree of risk of virtue of activity.

126
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:09,140
And there's another group of individuals that we call thinking individual.

127
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:18,560
And they will be they will be trying to meet the right time to.

128
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:31,909
Four go. A little bit of a spend that monetary value for respect for holding the

129
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:38,910
monetary value forward in chances to win a you know a bigger and bigger amount.

130
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:43,070
For example I'm going to give you. So this is insurance, right?

131
00:19:55,700 --> 00:20:05,870
And the Mickey Mouse, you know, example of why you should work on this one and you need to.

132
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:14,140
We have a copy there. The structure here.

133
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:24,010
These are cost right in cost tables.

134
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:50,760
And this is going to be a of table. And they let me change these numbers so you you can go for this one.

135
00:20:55,220 --> 00:21:03,890
And for the second one, you can either make a $100,000.

136
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:13,930
With probability 1% or lose $10.

137
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:22,440
We probably need 99%. So what is this temptation here?

138
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:34,230
We have to do this a little bit.

139
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:41,460
Feel a little more. We review.

140
00:21:47,320 --> 00:22:10,170
You didn't give these $800,000, but we probably need one in 2099 when things will be equal to.

141
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:27,470
It was out of the. You will going to be.

142
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:38,820
You can go to one minus this number here.

143
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:45,970
So. Right. So you have it.

144
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:55,520
You have a probability of. And let me make. He will need a bit more.

145
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:05,890
Whereas the decimal is right.

146
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:18,300
So you you have the probability of you can make $100,000 with probability of going zero zero 1%.

147
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:29,340
Right. Or to lose $10 with probability 90 999999 something.

148
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:37,650
Right. So this is still being.

149
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:47,580
You. Or you can.

150
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:55,970
Do not do. And then you respect them cause you respect them monitoring each other.

151
00:23:56,060 --> 00:24:00,560
This is the moment that you are living in your respective monetary value.

152
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,630
He's going to be. Either -$9.

153
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,849
If you go for the C show,

154
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:26,210
the one that means that you you you either win $100,000 or lose $10 with 99.99 9% probability or you don't do anything right.

155
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:30,860
And then then you get zero. So in expect the monetary value.

156
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:35,930
If you have to make the decision based on the aspect of monetary value, what would you do?

157
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:46,960
Just based on the street perspective, monetary value. What is the highest aspect of monetary value?

158
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:52,460
This is your one of decision to. Two.

159
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:57,610
Two. Right. So zero is greater than negative nine.

160
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:07,990
So you'll go for decision two. But if you go for this issue two all the time, nobody will play lottery, right?

161
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:12,510
Nobody will go to Las Vegas. So this is gambling.

162
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:21,959
So you are willing to make a decision to go and play a game with guns that, you know,

163
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:27,330
that are an expectation you are going to on expectation you're going to lose money.

164
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:34,500
But, you know, you have the chance of making $100,000, not the poor, that chance.

165
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:39,870
You know, you'll be able it will be you'll be willing to to play that money.

166
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:49,560
So. And that's why the casinos make money, right? Because every time you play, you know, they they will be making $9 out of you.

167
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:55,050
In general, they'll be making $9 out of you.

168
00:25:55,800 --> 00:26:04,500
So people will make a hundred thousand. But most of them, you know, will, you know, put $10 in the machine and will lose.

169
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:14,960
But you just put a lot of dollar making and thinking that maybe at two questions.

170
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:23,520
So for the payoff table in the cost table in column G there, we could call both of that.

171
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:28,890
Like both of those expected monetary value. But we just called the top one and expected costs.

172
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:34,680
I just didn't want to put all the negative numbers and put the cost positive.

173
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:41,700
We can do this based on monetary value. And then everything here will be negative.

174
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:49,979
Okay. Yeah, that was kind of my second question of like, if we wanted to match all of the rules that we made for,

175
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:54,840
like, Max you Max maximum where you select the highest possible payoff.

176
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:59,190
Wouldn't we want these to be negative? All of them should be negative.

177
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:03,660
Okay. So. And it causes us a negative payoff.

178
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:06,900
Yeah. And then these two separate the same thing. Okay.

179
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:11,060
So that's how we should. Right.

180
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:19,130
So now you have an idea of these are two different kind of decision makers.

181
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:26,570
These, you know, these individual is trying to hedge against big losses.

182
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,320
So that person is the risk averse individual. Right.

183
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:36,560
I am foregoing a little bit of aspect of monetary value because I want security.

184
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,480
These one is a risk seeking individual.

185
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:52,670
I am for going a little bit of expecting monetary value because I want to have the opportunity to win the money.

186
00:27:53,480 --> 00:28:08,300
And then I know the same person, the same individual who, you know, plays lottery and has health insurance and is being risk averse and risk sinking.

187
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:11,720
At the same time for four different problems.

188
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:17,780
So now, of course, there is the theory of insurance.

189
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:26,809
You know, this is what what I what I was doing was a lot of those probabilities and statistics can just probabilities right then for,

190
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:32,720
you know, what is being paid your needs and figured out how much the premiums actually and so on and so forth.

191
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:36,770
Right. In this case, for example.

192
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:40,200
So this is these is going to be the premium.

193
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:45,920
So we are charging for that insurance, that thousand dollars per year.

194
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:51,169
And your cost, you know, is $9.

195
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:55,190
But if you want to go without insurance, this is what you face.

196
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:20,580
But so you so know you have an idea about the what you know that sometimes individuals do not make decisions based on playing.

197
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:27,720
Thank you. Firms usually do.

198
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:37,350
We use this the monetary value because is sometimes is is difficult to to gauge what is the.

199
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:44,120
You know how race covers they are about the utility.

200
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:47,150
So they feel it is a risk operational risk seeking.

201
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,580
It is very subjective.

202
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:59,100
You know, it changes or I asked the same question to each one of you and you have different perceptions about what is going to be done.

203
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:11,629
So one of you might be saying, oh, I don't mind losing 50 bucks if I can make this amount of money and someone you might say, oh, 50 bucks.

204
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:16,400
Is that only questionable? And then you make a decision.

205
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:25,850
Right. So what we know for sure is that everybody will take the same decision based on respect the monetary value.

206
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:38,390
So if we do say, okay, we are going to make the decision that we maximize and they speak their mind that you value or minimizes the cost,

207
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:44,900
which is the same, then everybody, all of us will take the same decision.

208
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:53,390
So if I give you the chance to put your own your own feelings about reasonable return,

209
00:30:53,660 --> 00:31:03,740
then we may have a different thing and we may have different result.

210
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:08,840
Right. So. So how do we.

211
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:15,550
Quantify that difference between us?

212
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:25,070
Well, we are. We are going to divide.

213
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:41,560
We're going to separate. And we're going to classify individuals by their of how others they are our how how we see can they are.

214
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:46,180
And as sweetie have been for a year.

215
00:31:52,040 --> 00:32:02,689
We are not. Instead of measuring the spec their monetary values, we are going to measure utility and utility.

216
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:10,760
So instead of the monetary value. So we are going to make sure this present utility of this issue.

217
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:20,300
Therefore what the first thing we need to do is translate in your table.

218
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:31,340
So it made it so in pay of table that you get it in terms of how, how much satisfaction I get from that.

219
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:36,860
And that satisfaction is going to be different from you and for me.

220
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:44,190
So let's start, by the way.

221
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:04,350
What's going to be.

222
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:27,710
You look. And we stopped it with.

223
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:37,000
All. So let's see.

224
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:47,740
You know, let's say that we want to translate it feel stable in.

225
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:55,030
So the first thing we need to do is confuse what we call the utility function.

226
00:33:55,570 --> 00:34:26,240
So a utility function for each of. Really?

227
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:33,470
In the utility function overview of NGS.

228
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:49,230
Is a and a map. There's a function that maps your pay of x is your opinion.

229
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,800
Two goals on goal utility.

230
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:11,220
And in this case, first, we are going to map into something that we call utility that come if that's a number between we are.

231
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:18,420
And for these case, first, we are going to map into something that is between zero and one.

232
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:27,420
No zero is no satisfaction at all or meaningful satisfaction and one is maximum satisfaction.

233
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:38,490
Right? So we have a payoff table and we have to pay, you know, three, 20, five -50, whatever.

234
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:55,020
And then we are going to say, oh, this -50 is maps two in a utility of one and these 500 I'm sorry,

235
00:35:55,350 --> 00:36:00,899
18.5, but these 500 maps, we didn't do one or something like that.

236
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:07,110
Right. But it is not a linear and is not proportional because if you were proportional,

237
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:19,800
then we would be making decisions with to the monitoring value, which is that would be what we've been doing so far.

238
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:23,340
So when we do that.

239
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:49,820
So when we do that, we are going to be on the road.

240
00:36:56,060 --> 00:37:01,400
We are going to mob and this is the time to act.

241
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:09,560
Is it the exact things are going to be the pale and then.

242
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:17,510
So the insects, the x axis are going to be that.

243
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:23,150
This is the x ray. This is how much money you're going to be making.

244
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:29,270
And the y axis is going to be the utility that you are getting out of that.

245
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:43,900
I do not pay. Like if we make decisions based on this monetary value, then we go zero here one year.

246
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:50,840
If we make this issue based on expected monetary value, we have a straight line, right?

247
00:37:51,290 --> 00:38:05,540
So in line. So they doubled the payments to double their satisfaction.

248
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:15,530
Half the payment have their satisfaction. So for every dollar increase or decrease, you get the same amount of satisfaction.

249
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:26,389
Increase or decrease, i. Now most of us are not like that to make this easier, being that most of those individually make decisions.

250
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:38,330
Something like following a curve like. And this is going to work.

251
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:44,749
And, you know, this is zero utility, one utility.

252
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:49,850
And the concern is that this is designed to.

253
00:38:52,610 --> 00:39:00,450
These are the people in over here on the these curves.

254
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:10,639
This curve represents the seashore in what we call a risk averse decision.

255
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:22,790
Make Z person who move forward go a little bit about of its monetary value for security to trade for security.

256
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:29,180
Now what what are the implications of the if.

257
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:41,450
In the decision maker Danny Rees covers. Well they have these curved cocaine and what, what what is important is that, you know,

258
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:50,569
the big curve represents decreasing mind you know utility like so is every for

259
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:59,300
increase or every extra dollar you get less and less increase in satisfaction.

260
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:16,070
You're saturated. So and you know, if you if you have $500,000 and someone give you $100,000 more, you get that big jump in your utility.

261
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:20,200
But it's another now you get to 600,000.

262
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:26,750
If someone give you a hundred thousand more, you get a a lower jump.

263
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:31,570
So a smaller in jump that you go from 503.6 million.

264
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:38,270
Right. The more you get, the less total satisfaction you are receiving.

265
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:53,510
You are staggering, right? So it's also you can actually sit down, consider that this is an individual if you are here, that is worry.

266
00:40:53,520 --> 00:41:06,110
If if you take these amount of money from that person, you get the same amount of you in is jumping.

267
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:13,270
You get down. So it's going to be colder here.

268
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:28,330
But if you give the same amount of payoff, the jump of utility is going to be so facilitating is going to be here.

269
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:32,190
So the jumping utility is going to be much smaller. Right.

270
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:38,800
So these number here, this delta is much smaller than these Delta here.

271
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:55,870
Right. So that what it means is these individual gets more dissatisfaction about losing $1 than the satisfaction of gaining one.

272
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:05,870
So these are some of these more free or world happy when that person loses money versus that person mates.

273
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:12,280
And that is the hallmark of a risk averse individual.

274
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:17,470
You know, you don't want you want to prevent to prevent loss.

275
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:28,530
These are shown here. And there are many degrees of freedom.

276
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:36,070
Another version is, for example, this is a very recent, very, very rich coverage.

277
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:43,590
This is new discoveries in 1981.

278
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:54,540
This person is what we call a race neutral person.

279
00:43:07,450 --> 00:43:18,909
Means neutral means that that person is indifferent about making the same amount of money or losing the same amount of money you give.

280
00:43:18,910 --> 00:43:26,559
That is is is neutral with regard about losing or making money.

281
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:36,430
So bails. So that person is is makes decision is strictly based on money.

282
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:41,680
It's doubled the money doubled in satisfaction. Have the money happiness of this fact.

283
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:51,850
And then the third one. The third type of decision maker that we don't have very many of those but any curve we know

284
00:43:51,850 --> 00:44:01,870
the reasons a personality and you get something like these is a risk seeking individual.

285
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:18,860
We think you. We think an individual.

286
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:37,270
And reaching an individual. It just means that these person gets more and increasing satisfaction for an extra payment,

287
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:44,390
which is higher than their increasing satisfaction, for they're using the same amount of money.

288
00:44:44,410 --> 00:44:51,940
So if you gave that person a hundred more dollars, then that person is very happy, right?

289
00:44:52,390 --> 00:45:06,530
Well, if you think that, you think $100 from that person, that person is not as is not as unhappy as it was happy for to get them there.

290
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:14,000
The extra one one so is okay so that person say, oh, you took $100 from me, that's fine.

291
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:25,540
Again, I can you know, you can allow that, but you give that person $100 as a yes, it gives you high.

292
00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:37,780
And those are gamblers. Right. People who make, you know, decisions to you know, to in order to even make do with them.

293
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:41,890
When are we being. That's the simple.

294
00:45:45,370 --> 00:45:52,520
Those people take a little risk and. Sometimes you don't think it could be.

295
00:45:54,230 --> 00:46:07,850
Oh, so now. But most of us, most of us are in this range in the race, car, race, color and some degree of risk aversion.

296
00:46:08,910 --> 00:46:16,670
And now let's say let's let's build a table for and in one.

297
00:46:17,810 --> 00:46:22,430
There's been a table. And we do.

298
00:46:22,790 --> 00:46:28,530
I'm going to. To ask for your help.

299
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:33,840
I'm going to get in. Pay off the table. I.

300
00:46:37,060 --> 00:47:01,780
Young. So I'm going to have a.

301
00:47:27,450 --> 00:47:40,140
Okay. So now I'm going to get three decisions and three state of nature, three decisions of the decision.

302
00:47:40,710 --> 00:47:49,530
One decision to be completed for the new year.

303
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:55,890
One is dealing with the.

304
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:12,420
And the state of emergency. And then I'm going to get your reminders.

305
00:48:13,350 --> 00:48:20,160
100, 1000, 2000.

306
00:48:23,230 --> 00:48:29,650
And in the second one, the. Zero.

307
00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:48,870
Nobody knows. 25. And the 531 went to good.

308
00:48:55,100 --> 00:49:00,130
Can you get me and get rid of negative numbers for.

309
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:06,330
To make it easier.

310
00:49:06,690 --> 00:49:12,990
So we get the scoop on the.

311
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:36,140
On the. Those are the ones that we want to change.

312
00:49:36,690 --> 00:49:38,069
So we are going to do that.

313
00:49:38,070 --> 00:49:46,710
First thing we're going to do is figured out what a risk neutral individual, what would the reasonable probability we will do?

314
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:50,130
So I'm going to get this patent monetary value.

315
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:07,770
And then problem.

316
00:50:10,370 --> 00:50:28,259
It's just. Well. If you're willing to pay for this one in the pocket and the decision to take the money for this,

317
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:35,870
you should once you step in the decision to is one of 7.5 decision three is fine.

318
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:45,360
Great. So it looks like decision one is the one with the highest has been given a large.

319
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:55,070
No. Let's now create it.

320
00:50:55,520 --> 00:51:00,560
So right now, we this is the utility.

321
00:51:01,190 --> 00:51:09,650
This is the spent the monetary value, which is proportional to the utility that a risk and neutral individuals will get.

322
00:51:10,430 --> 00:51:18,650
Now, what I'm going to do is I'm going to change all these numbers into utility bills.

323
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:24,050
So we need to go into saving.

324
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:37,900
And that I mean, they feel and this is what you're going to do.

325
00:51:38,350 --> 00:51:49,690
So look for the wars pay you for the loan would pay you the value of table and that low pay over pay you can be positive can be negative.

326
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:55,180
Right below is bail. You assign a utility of zero.

327
00:51:55,720 --> 00:52:00,640
So what is it always payable? But you've got a three.

328
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:07,850
So that's going to be here. Is zero.

329
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:16,000
Now we look for the highest bail.

330
00:52:16,450 --> 00:52:22,029
And the highest bail is either 2000 a year or 2000.

331
00:52:22,030 --> 00:52:28,690
He had both 2008 high his bail. That video has utility of one.

332
00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:32,600
So we're going to get one. One.

333
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:40,230
No. Okay. Those are two extremes. Now, let's.

334
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:45,230
You know, let's see. You know how we can compute.

335
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:48,540
The older they are, the older.

336
00:52:51,170 --> 00:53:05,240
For example, I am going to find what is the utility that we assign or one of you assigns to the value of of 100.

337
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:21,830
And this is what you are going to do. Suppose that you can play a game of channels in either you get $100, no questions for sure,

338
00:53:23,270 --> 00:53:34,580
or decide to play this game of chance in which you have a probability p of making the highest

339
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:44,200
to the $2,000 and a probability one minus P of getting the worst because you alone win.

340
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:50,620
So you have to chance. You have to go over to the side.

341
00:53:50,900 --> 00:54:08,600
So you have either. Get the funding going for sure.

342
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:24,540
We'll leave everything.

343
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:55,730
We had the opportunity. $2,003,000 liability.

344
00:55:03,070 --> 00:55:23,150
Or zero. When probability.

345
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:35,680
One name has been. So those are your two options.

346
00:55:36,490 --> 00:55:41,380
No. One to play the game.

347
00:55:48,350 --> 00:56:03,950
Do you hear me? So how about if I tell you that the probability of winning that $2,000 is 50%?

348
00:56:04,810 --> 00:56:12,040
So you have 50% chance of making 2,053% chance of making it zero.

349
00:56:12,910 --> 00:56:16,540
Or you can, you know, get out with for sure.

350
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:23,520
800. Would you take it? What would you do? Would do you think $200 or would you play?

351
00:56:27,130 --> 00:56:33,460
Amy. You played him the game with nice people.

352
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:38,140
Okay. So at that point then and then you play the game.

353
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:51,910
What about if I tell you that he is 30%, you think $100 or you play the game?

354
00:56:54,940 --> 00:57:01,150
And if I tell you that baby is 1001.

355
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:10,500
Do you want to play with me? So we are going to go into business.

356
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:15,030
We find that the highest fee for which you are is different.

357
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:29,010
The highest fee for which you are indifferent between playing the game or working out with it is for sure.

358
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:43,020
I'm not paying the highest be that makes you different is the utility that you want sign to that hundred dollars that high?

359
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:48,270
Is that the highest fees that utility that you assign to one another in your life?

360
00:57:48,690 --> 00:57:59,610
And the reason is right. So we want to figure out what the utility of $100 is.

361
00:58:03,210 --> 00:58:06,780
And then the utility of the.

362
00:58:06,810 --> 00:58:12,070
Be the utility of.

363
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:18,190
Because they're because they're the same. Right.

364
00:58:18,490 --> 00:58:33,160
So we are looking at the P that makes the same. So it's going to be the utility of 2000 times p the the the zero.

365
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:45,310
We got one way. So.

366
00:58:45,310 --> 00:58:53,690
But that means that you're cleaning the. Of 100.

367
00:58:59,770 --> 00:59:03,040
To be willing to let the utility of themselves.

368
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:15,010
So one, he is right. So does the utility of zero.

369
00:59:15,090 --> 00:59:25,230
And one of the individual 000 right is the worst you of utility of zero.

370
00:59:25,350 --> 00:59:31,530
In this case, they gave him zero zero. So that means that he knows the utility of one.

371
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:38,160
Because here you have the utility of zero in zero times.

372
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:49,080
Am I not busy? So that's why we can calculate the utility of the payoff in that.

373
00:59:49,950 --> 00:59:58,830
And then you just go for each entry and then you ask yourself, what is the highest B for which you are indifferent?

374
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:09,510
And keep going, keep going, keep going. And that is going to be different for each one of you, you know, on.

375
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:21,720
So no, no two individuals are going to have this same.

376
01:00:24,570 --> 01:00:28,390
You think the utility. Utility.

377
01:00:28,410 --> 01:00:34,910
Yeah. Utility made it for example for me would be you know,

378
01:00:35,910 --> 01:00:42,360
it's either get $200 for sure I'm playing a game of chance to have the opportunity

379
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:50,490
to win 2000 would probably be the P or zero with probability one minus P.

380
01:00:51,060 --> 01:00:56,110
I think the high highest for me would be based on five and probably five.

381
01:00:58,770 --> 01:01:12,580
Now a lot of. Here we go.

382
01:01:12,610 --> 01:01:16,090
Zero 204. Really? I really do.

383
01:01:17,020 --> 01:01:24,630
How much would I be? I need to be sure about 26.

384
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:37,550
Right. So 60%. So the probability one thinks that that I am going to get the tools out of the order that we've made that game.

385
01:01:37,570 --> 01:01:49,120
And I want them doing it. So I need to be more sure that I'm going to win the $2,000 to Orlando and $200 for sure.

386
01:01:50,350 --> 01:02:00,670
And then these numbers just sounds and I think we would be paying five.

387
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:14,920
So I need to be about 90% sure in every war we met.

388
01:02:14,950 --> 01:02:27,179
So, see, I. I can walk out with $1,000 for sure, or, you know, going to this game of chance.

389
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:30,680
And how sure should I be there?

390
01:02:30,690 --> 01:02:35,910
I'm going to be making 2000, $12,000 for sure.

391
01:02:37,180 --> 01:02:45,810
You know, when I. If I were, you do things and then.

392
01:02:47,620 --> 01:02:52,270
25 in that.

393
01:02:53,900 --> 01:03:02,600
When you find those abandoned, you get $25 for sure.

394
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:07,460
Of viruses playing the game of chance.

395
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:11,840
I would say that one.

396
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:20,590
That's when we leave.

397
01:03:21,140 --> 01:03:35,180
And then we get to 502 hundred, 220 these things because we already determined that for me and 500.

398
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:42,480
500 would be for me that same me.

399
01:03:45,980 --> 01:03:53,000
And it took me a while to 80% sure that I'm going to be making 2000 in order to work out of my home.

400
01:03:53,300 --> 01:04:02,210
So that was my that's my car, right? That is the utilities that I assigned to these bales.

401
01:04:03,470 --> 01:04:06,590
You will be assigning something different.

402
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:17,270
But this is what I would assign. And then what I would do in this case is simply taking this vector monetary value of the utilities.

403
01:04:17,810 --> 01:04:20,930
So this is going to be equal to this.

404
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:32,350
It is. Times.

405
01:04:33,980 --> 01:04:48,700
In that they didn't. So this is my expected utility for the 1.75 four decision two is 119 and four decision 3.68.

406
01:04:48,710 --> 01:04:51,950
So, you know, steel wings is one.

407
01:04:52,280 --> 01:05:01,320
But what? Yeah. And it's pretty much in the same order that we have this victim monetary value put in

408
01:05:01,510 --> 01:05:06,669
with different proportions because I am a risk averse in the EU and in this case.

409
01:05:06,670 --> 01:05:12,250
So it's not as, you know, proportional to the payoff as we had before.

410
01:05:13,390 --> 01:05:24,700
But this is my curve. And then based on that, I would, you know, I would do a decision, one that maximizes my utility.

411
01:05:24,970 --> 01:05:32,320
It's easy. For example, let's see if.

412
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:39,160
If something something changed with the.

413
01:05:46,890 --> 01:05:51,750
So it's a good thing that you're 49.

414
01:05:55,610 --> 01:06:01,140
105. He was your.

415
01:06:05,490 --> 01:06:12,810
So in this case, you see they spend their monetary value.

416
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:20,759
In this case, they spent their monetary value. Decision 3 to 3 has the highest respect.

417
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:27,130
The monetary value. Right. But. The highest utility.

418
01:06:27,730 --> 01:06:34,629
We get to have insurance and they haven't changed that.

419
01:06:34,630 --> 01:06:45,220
It would be something. Yeah.

420
01:06:46,020 --> 01:06:53,460
It's. You shouldn't worry. And [INAUDIBLE] be as big as you need him to.

421
01:06:55,140 --> 01:07:03,030
Just not probably cut as as we had before, but that.

422
01:07:05,780 --> 01:07:14,460
But yeah we could we would make, you know, exercises will make the problems in which, you know,

423
01:07:14,510 --> 01:07:22,930
you can make a decision which is different from what you make in this respect and wouldn't tell you, I think.

424
01:07:23,870 --> 01:07:33,100
Why wouldn't you just set up the probability P to 5% for 100?

425
01:07:33,110 --> 01:07:37,750
So like. 5% of 2000 is 100.

426
01:07:38,140 --> 01:07:51,280
So you would be indifferent about earning 100 with 100% likelihood or earning 2000 with 5% likelihood because your expected value at 25% is 100.

427
01:07:52,430 --> 01:07:57,750
But because in that case, I would be no drop in value.

428
01:07:58,730 --> 01:08:03,400
Oh, and you're just not. Okay. You know, that's why.

429
01:08:03,690 --> 01:08:11,500
You know. Yeah. We can do this completely proportional calculations with neutral, and we'll give you a straight line.

430
01:08:11,530 --> 01:08:19,299
Right. But the thing is that we are mapping a totally different curve and it curves.

431
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:21,850
That is very subjective. That is different for you.

432
01:08:23,710 --> 01:08:36,700
And so that and so in your example of being risk averse, you wouldn't just say, like, okay, your probability for 100 is 5%.

433
01:08:36,850 --> 01:08:41,560
So then wouldn't your probability of 25 be one quarter of that?

434
01:08:42,190 --> 01:08:47,070
That's just not how it is going to be.

435
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:50,880
My utility is not shock value.

436
01:08:52,490 --> 01:08:58,190
Yeah. Well.

437
01:09:01,070 --> 01:09:05,590
Now. There is.

438
01:09:15,340 --> 01:09:24,130
Instead of just going into each one of those entries of see you around this game.

439
01:09:24,430 --> 01:09:29,290
Right. You know, it will be very tedious and very subjective.

440
01:09:29,710 --> 01:09:45,010
So this is you know, this is you know, analysts have come up with some approximation of a risk, gathers individual functions for operations in the EU.

441
01:09:45,460 --> 01:09:51,790
And one of them is what you building the exponential utility function.

442
01:09:52,540 --> 01:09:56,470
The exponential utility function because something like this.

443
01:10:06,710 --> 01:10:14,230
Don't have to worry too much about the one might be worth the exponential.

444
01:10:14,230 --> 01:10:29,060
You think information comes. In this case, individuals have the individual have the chance to have negative utility.

445
01:10:35,700 --> 01:10:37,919
But the maximal utility.

446
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:48,750
So there's a possibility of having this negative utility over here or negative fails give you a negative utility positive for you.

447
01:10:49,390 --> 01:10:52,680
Giving positive utility, they might see one.

448
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:53,700
It's going to be one.

449
01:10:54,420 --> 01:11:07,560
And the only thing is that the minimal is not going to be here and the formula for the exponential function is going to be the utility of x.

450
01:11:11,050 --> 01:11:14,620
It's important to learn my news.

451
01:11:18,790 --> 01:11:38,180
This is the exponential function. Minus X, which is the payload divided by R, which is a constant for that measure how recent coverage in person is.

452
01:11:38,830 --> 01:11:40,780
So this is a.

453
01:11:45,460 --> 01:11:57,790
This is an attempt to make it stronger, an operational curb, without having to ask people, you know, whether they feel about risk of return.

454
01:11:58,060 --> 01:12:08,889
And this is what, you know, companies will use if they have to if they have to use a utility is they want

455
01:12:08,890 --> 01:12:22,900
to incorporate the risk in getting them to the risk in their decision making.

456
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:26,980
This is the one of the formulas we all use.

457
01:12:27,250 --> 01:12:32,500
So you you know, everything here. This is the utility of x.

458
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:38,500
X is the pain, right? And this is the exponential function.

459
01:12:39,220 --> 01:12:47,740
E to the power of something is to send it into the base of the natural law.

460
01:12:48,580 --> 01:12:55,300
And this is then a and these are now how we raise your arm.

461
01:12:56,470 --> 01:13:06,400
So the only thing that that we need to make sure that is that is different for each decision maker is this constant r.

462
01:13:09,410 --> 01:13:29,690
And the big, big concern are is the maximum payoff, the maximum amount of money for which you would be willing to pay to play this game.

463
01:13:30,470 --> 01:13:33,890
You can win.

464
01:13:36,230 --> 01:13:40,160
You can win an X or, you know, a video.

465
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:51,810
With probability going five.

466
01:13:54,750 --> 01:14:02,740
Or lose. Half with probability point five.

467
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:09,070
That's, you know, that that that is that is Your Honor.

468
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:19,130
I so you either win this amount of money with 2.5 or lose half of the money you throw away.

469
01:14:20,870 --> 01:14:21,860
And the maximum,

470
01:14:22,070 --> 01:14:40,700
the maximum amount of the maximum P that you're willing to consider within a game of in these terms that is going to be your r so they say that you.

471
01:14:42,040 --> 01:14:45,910
What what would be a R for me?

472
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:55,360
I would be willing to make. I was willing to bet to make $10,000.

473
01:14:57,440 --> 01:15:11,680
You know, if if I have bona fide probability of making this $10,000, but I need to have bona fide probability of losing a half of that.

474
01:15:12,460 --> 01:15:24,040
Fine. So, you know, I say, okay, I can lose $5,000 because I want to win the $10,000 so I can play the game.

475
01:15:25,180 --> 01:15:34,510
But let's say that I go into 20,000 and they say, you can I can win $20,000.

476
01:15:35,020 --> 01:15:42,220
We really win five or lose 10,000 with a block of 45 points.

477
01:15:42,340 --> 01:15:49,630
I don't have money to lose $10,000. 50% probability of life makes it then 20,000.

478
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:56,080
You know, I don't really want to. I cannot afford to meet anyone.

479
01:15:56,090 --> 01:16:05,470
So that maximum number, that maximum value, which is, in my case, 20,000.

480
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:12,430
That's of you are on your organizations.

481
01:16:12,700 --> 01:16:18,340
Get them out. You get a body of our individuals can get their value far and so on and so forth.

482
01:16:18,850 --> 01:16:35,660
And then what you do with that is it is if we know that I for me is 20,000, when you have a pay on the table, then you simply use it.

483
01:16:35,790 --> 01:16:39,210
It's I can do that. This is my pay, right?

484
01:16:39,940 --> 01:16:45,550
My RS 20,000. So what, what I'm going to do is,

485
01:16:45,790 --> 01:16:56,980
is you would trade that into utilities and the utilities is going to be you want to be watching one

486
01:16:57,980 --> 01:17:15,690
use the exponential function the little reminders in the field divided by 20,000 that's that becomes.

487
01:17:17,650 --> 01:17:22,180
So once I have that, then I have my contingent.

488
01:17:30,430 --> 01:17:40,540
And those are those are made in men. In this case, which one maximizes my individual risk aversion avenue?

489
01:17:40,900 --> 01:17:47,260
And in this case, maintaining 1010111014.

490
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:58,630
So these three, given my level of risk aversion, the three is there is is the decision that I will make.

491
01:18:01,990 --> 01:18:14,710
No, I'm going to. So all you need to do is apply exactly the order of the homework that you do this week is just apply that formula.

492
01:18:16,240 --> 01:18:22,140
There are going to be two problems, one in which you have the your p of table.

493
01:18:22,150 --> 01:18:30,880
And once you have that the table, you do maximize maximizing an expected monetary value.

494
01:18:32,050 --> 01:18:41,530
And so and then the second question, so they asked you to look at utilities.

495
01:18:42,310 --> 01:18:50,090
So if you had to make decisions with the individual using the data for the entire function, then how are you?

496
01:18:51,370 --> 01:18:54,610
That's it. I'm sorry, I'm.

497
01:18:56,990 --> 01:19:06,010
And I'm a little slow. They say my vaccine is the vaccine that put you to sleep.

498
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:12,510
I mean, who knows?

499
01:19:13,820 --> 01:19:17,950
All right. But I'll be more awake on Thursday.

500
01:19:18,220 --> 01:19:21,490
So Thursday we are going to decide decision three.

501
01:19:22,390 --> 01:19:27,250
I mean, can you do it by the end of the week?

502
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:38,460
By the end of the week or next week on Tuesday morning?

503
01:19:38,660 --> 01:19:53,470
Well, that was a last minute trip to D.C. for the actual meeting that people are putting together.

504
01:19:54,640 --> 01:20:00,220
I'm sorry. I think to Tuesday or Thursday.

505
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:08,560
Next Tuesday. All right. We don't have them organized.

506
01:20:15,310 --> 01:20:20,080
So, you know, so tonight, sit down.

507
01:20:20,110 --> 01:20:39,850
Tomorrow's interview, that thing that comes on Thursday in France where there is a collective attempt to literally fight their way out.

508
01:20:39,970 --> 01:20:55,900
The name of that part of who are willing to work with you right now in the United States to some degree, but it will be a lot.

509
01:21:06,170 --> 01:21:10,040
I'm not sure you're supposed to hear them.

510
01:21:10,060 --> 01:21:15,490
I'm not even going to have time.

511
01:21:16,130 --> 01:21:35,270
I'm going to be at Salt Lake. You know, so, you know, I like I just I'm just going to ignore it right now.

512
01:21:37,530 --> 01:21:41,090
Yeah, but it's just like.

513
01:21:41,850 --> 01:21:44,870
I know. I know. I don't care.

514
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:49,720
Yeah. Hey, how are you? Are you okay?

515
01:21:50,270 --> 01:21:56,560
I don't mind. Okay. Whenever we decide to meet, you know.

516
01:21:57,290 --> 01:22:08,360
Yeah, I hold as the clock will go out.

517
01:22:08,750 --> 01:22:17,380
Yeah. There's someone studying at some hospital next week.

518
01:22:17,870 --> 01:22:23,170
Do we have, you know, how we are going to get a second chance?

519
01:22:23,210 --> 01:22:35,340
Because I'm going to be imprisoned, so to speak, next week on Tuesdays and Wednesdays to make the classic.

520
01:22:36,890 --> 01:22:45,500
So these numbers are all these people have been for years, you know.

521
01:22:46,940 --> 01:22:54,670
So you go to. Oh, yeah.

522
01:22:56,770 --> 01:23:06,120
So you think you want to keep the cameras? There is no reason to do that.

523
01:23:06,830 --> 01:23:09,879
That's where he says it's okay. Okay. Thank you.

524
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:27,090
Thank you. I think there are two things. Okay, this is what I do.

525
01:23:27,100 --> 01:23:32,470
All right? Oh, yes.

526
01:23:32,670 --> 01:23:37,420
That's great.

527
01:23:37,420 --> 01:23:41,380
Why do you keep making this news?

528
01:23:42,580 --> 01:24:08,780
I do not want to be accused of killing them today than it was in 1993.

529
01:24:10,240 --> 01:24:18,650
Oh, I didn't know that.

530
01:24:20,530 --> 01:24:26,710
Okay. Because it gives him the ability.

531
01:24:28,570 --> 01:24:33,100
I really, really do think, you know.

532
01:24:33,990 --> 01:24:39,520
I don't know how you do that.

533
01:24:41,860 --> 01:24:45,570
Yes, I will.

534
01:24:45,730 --> 01:24:51,080
But like 1934, I went to the that.

535
01:24:53,380 --> 01:24:55,930
Oh, right, right, right, right. I know my face.
