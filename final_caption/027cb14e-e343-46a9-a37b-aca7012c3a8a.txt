1
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:11,445
After watching this video,

2
00:00:11,445 --> 00:00:13,950
you will be able to
use PROC SURVEYFREQ to

3
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,430
get frequencies and 2 by 2
tables with survey data.

4
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,880
So SAS has a family of
survey procedures that you

5
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,620
can use to analyze
your survey data

6
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,060
from complex sampling.

7
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,240
They are PROC SURVEYSELECT,
PROC SURVEYFREQ,

8
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,535
PROC SURVEYMEANS, PROC SURVEYREG,

9
00:00:29,535 --> 00:00:32,430
PROC SURVEYLOGISTIC,
and PROC SURVEYPHREG.

10
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:36,795
We won't cover PROC SURVEYSELECT
or PROC SURVEYPHREG.

11
00:00:36,795 --> 00:00:40,990
You will see that PROC SURVEYFREQ
means REG and LOGISTIC

12
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:43,340
share many characteristics with

13
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,920
their corresponding
non-survey PROCs.

14
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,330
But, of course, they have
their own particularities.

15
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:51,945
Let's go back to our sample.

16
00:00:51,945 --> 00:00:53,555
Remember our design is

17
00:00:53,555 --> 00:00:56,885
a complex design that
uses cluster sampling.

18
00:00:56,885 --> 00:00:59,240
We will need to use a
clustering variable

19
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,725
to take that into account.

20
00:01:00,725 --> 00:01:03,470
Another sign is not
equi-probabilistic.

21
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:05,000
That is, every child has

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,070
not the same probability

23
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:09,120
of being selected into the study.

24
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,160
Therefore, we will need
to use sampling weights.

25
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,365
Our outcome is a binary
variable, overweight,

26
00:01:15,365 --> 00:01:19,204
defined with a cutoff on their
weight to height Z-score,

27
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:22,270
and is coded as 0,
no, and 1, yes.

28
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:24,429
We will use PROC SURVEYFREQ

29
00:01:24,429 --> 00:01:26,435
to answer those two questions.

30
00:01:26,435 --> 00:01:29,014
First, what is the prevalence

31
00:01:29,014 --> 00:01:30,875
of overweight in the population?

32
00:01:30,875 --> 00:01:35,570
Second, is being bottled-fed
associated with overweight?

33
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:38,615
Let's start with the
prevalence of overweight.

34
00:01:38,615 --> 00:01:40,655
With simple random sampling,

35
00:01:40,655 --> 00:01:42,320
you would use PROC FREQ on

36
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,870
the overweight
variable, easy peasy.

37
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,610
Now, we are not selecting

38
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:49,085
our children with simple
random sampling here.

39
00:01:49,085 --> 00:01:51,020
Note two things that

40
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:53,360
PROC FREQ will not
take into account.

41
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,820
First, the weights, therefore,

42
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,965
you will get an
incorrect prevalence.

43
00:01:57,965 --> 00:02:01,010
Weights are used to
balance the fact

44
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:02,390
that children were not

45
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:04,645
selected with the
same probability.

46
00:02:04,645 --> 00:02:06,530
Children who were selected with

47
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:10,250
a smaller probability should
weight more in the analysis

48
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,320
and the other way around to get

49
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,395
a correct and
representative estimate

50
00:02:15,395 --> 00:02:17,120
of the general population.

51
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,670
Second, clustering, the data was

52
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:22,055
collected with a cluster
sampling design.

53
00:02:22,055 --> 00:02:24,845
Clusters are more similar
within each other.

54
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:28,120
That means the observations
are somewhat correlated.

55
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,870
Therefore, you didn't take
into account the clustering,

56
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:33,710
your standard errors will
be incorrect and you

57
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:37,790
will get an incorrect 95
percent confidence interval.

58
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:42,830
That's why PROC SURVEYFREQ
now has two new statements,

59
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:45,955
one for the clustering
and one for the weight.

60
00:02:45,955 --> 00:02:47,955
The rest is the same,

61
00:02:47,955 --> 00:02:49,620
as in the normal PROC FREQ.

62
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,495
Note that the statements are

63
00:02:51,495 --> 00:02:54,350
cluster and weight
statements and I

64
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:56,480
happen to name the
variables that represent

65
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,045
the clusters and the weights
as cluster and weights too.

66
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:02,545
Don't get confused, they
could have other mix.

67
00:03:02,545 --> 00:03:05,235
Now let's look at the output.

68
00:03:05,235 --> 00:03:06,650
SAS always gives you

69
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:09,320
some type of information
at the beginning.

70
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,820
Here in the Data Summary,

71
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,770
it's telling you that
you have 30 clusters,

72
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:16,745
which is correct and 400
observations, which is correct.

73
00:03:16,745 --> 00:03:19,370
It gives you also
the sum of weights,

74
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:21,095
but you can ignore that.

75
00:03:21,095 --> 00:03:22,850
Now let's look at the table.

76
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:24,825
You have the
overweight variable 0,

77
00:03:24,825 --> 00:03:26,190
no, and yes, 1.

78
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:28,575
First, you have
the row frequency,

79
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:33,060
89 children are overweight
and 311 are not.

80
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,795
Know that if this was
simple random sampling,

81
00:03:35,795 --> 00:03:37,834
you could get an
unweighted prevalence

82
00:03:37,834 --> 00:03:40,504
just dividing 89 over 400,

83
00:03:40,504 --> 00:03:43,175
and that would give
you 22.3 percent.

84
00:03:43,175 --> 00:03:46,110
But that prevalence is incorrect.

85
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:48,630
The one that is
correct is the one in

86
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:51,165
the percent column, 20.6 percent.

87
00:03:51,165 --> 00:03:53,460
That's the weighted prevalence.

88
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:56,570
Note that the standard errors
of those percentages are

89
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,010
also correct because they

90
00:03:58,010 --> 00:03:59,810
take into account the clustering.

91
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:03,020
You could build a correct 95
percent confidence interval

92
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:05,800
for your prevalence
if you will want.

93
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,360
What if you also have is a
strata in your sampling?

94
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,870
Well, we didn't. But if
you work with data that

95
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:14,795
was collected also using
the strata sampling,

96
00:04:14,795 --> 00:04:17,010
then you can add a
strata statement,

97
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:20,010
or you could put the name
of your strata variable.

98
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:23,270
Also, an important note
on cluster variables.

99
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,130
By default, SAS uses

100
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:27,370
Taylor series to
estimate the variance

101
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,720
and will only take into

102
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,255
account the primary
sampling unit,

103
00:04:32,255 --> 00:04:34,520
that is, the first cluster.

104
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,320
That means that even if you have

105
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,135
more than one cluster
in this stage,

106
00:04:38,135 --> 00:04:40,415
you only need to
specify the first one,

107
00:04:40,415 --> 00:04:43,130
the first cluster or
primary sampling unit.

108
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:46,115
We actually had another
clustering, remember?

109
00:04:46,115 --> 00:04:48,365
Within villages we
selected households,

110
00:04:48,365 --> 00:04:49,850
but we only need to specify

111
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:53,120
the first cluster that
corresponds to the villages.

112
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,595
Same as with PROC SURVEYFREQ,

113
00:04:56,595 --> 00:04:58,670
you can also do 2 by 2 tables and

114
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:01,355
calculate the corresponding
statistical tests.

115
00:05:01,355 --> 00:05:03,500
The equivalent of
the chi-square test

116
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,895
for correlated data is

117
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:08,570
still a chi-square but is
called Rao Scott chi-square,

118
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:11,305
and takes into account
the complex design.

119
00:05:11,305 --> 00:05:13,790
Let's see if there
is any association

120
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:17,105
between being bottle-fed
and being overweight.

121
00:05:17,105 --> 00:05:18,875
What is your hypothesis?

122
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:21,590
Well, in theory, in
high-income countries,

123
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:23,480
being bottle-fed
is associated with

124
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,640
a higher prevalence
of overweight.

125
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,225
But let's see what we find here.

126
00:05:28,225 --> 00:05:31,025
The syntax is the same as before.

127
00:05:31,025 --> 00:05:33,920
Don't forget your cluster
and weight statements.

128
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,010
Now in the tables just
close the two variables,

129
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:38,900
the overweight and
the bottle-fed.

130
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,000
Note that after the slash I

131
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,085
also added a chi-square option,

132
00:05:43,085 --> 00:05:44,495
same as with PROC FREQ.

133
00:05:44,495 --> 00:05:47,689
But this one will give me
the Rao-Scott chi-square,

134
00:05:47,689 --> 00:05:50,255
which takes into account
the complex design.

135
00:05:50,255 --> 00:05:53,330
Also note that I added
the row option to

136
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:56,465
get row percentages because
in PROC SURVEYFREQ,

137
00:05:56,465 --> 00:05:59,300
SAS only gives you the
cell percentages by

138
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:03,650
default and we know those
are not that useful.

139
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:06,360
Even though this does not look

140
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,280
as your usual 2 by 2 table,

141
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,200
it is a 2 by 2 table.

142
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,095
You have the outcome
overweight, no, yes,

143
00:06:13,095 --> 00:06:15,180
and within each, you have

144
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,985
this portion bottle-fed, no, yes.

145
00:06:17,985 --> 00:06:19,970
Know that the percentage that you

146
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:21,650
want to use to describe
the results is

147
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:23,840
the row percentage
because you can see

148
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,600
that almost 33
percent of children

149
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,735
were bottle-fed among
non-overweight children,

150
00:06:29,735 --> 00:06:31,820
while only 40 percent were

151
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,360
bottle-fed among
overweight children.

152
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,650
This association is statistically

153
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:40,220
significant if you look
at the Rao-Scott p-value.

154
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:43,040
But know that the
association goes actually

155
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,875
in the opposite direction
of our hypothesis.

156
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:47,500
Why is that the case?

157
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,040
Well, we don't really know.

158
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,240
But we speculated that
in low-income countries

159
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,495
maybe being bottle-fed is
associated with malnutrition.

160
00:06:56,495 --> 00:06:59,060
Because water used to
prepare bottles may be

161
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,910
contaminated and those kids
may have more infections.

162
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:04,615
But, of course, that's
only a speculation.

163
00:07:04,615 --> 00:07:07,995
In summary, in this video
we use PROC SURVEYFREQ

164
00:07:07,995 --> 00:07:10,935
to get frequencies and 2 by
2 tables with survey data.

165
00:07:10,935 --> 00:07:12,510
In the next one, we will use

166
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:15,584
PROC SURVEYMEANS to get means.
