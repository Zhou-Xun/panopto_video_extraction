1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,070
Record today. I know there are a few people sitting be here that want to hear this.

2
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,060
Did anybody do anything fun over the break? No.

3
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:26,610
Relax. Hopefully. No, thanks.

4
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:30,550
You were in the field over there.

5
00:00:31,310 --> 00:01:00,610
I started in. So I'll give you a preview of this semester for professional development.

6
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,610
Today, we're talking about applying to Ph.D. programs.

7
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:10,600
I'm going to focus I'm going to be broad, but then I'm also going to talk specifically about the Michigan State program.

8
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:17,340
And then there will be more about internship and career readiness.

9
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:22,140
So talking about interview skills, both technical and non-technical,

10
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:27,040
and I think we're going to have some people on stage for resources and alumni come to give those talks.

11
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:32,530
We'll have another alumni panel that's talking about career choices and day to day life.

12
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:43,000
We're going to have two more sessions on writing explicitly about how to make sure that your writing structure is good,

13
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:50,830
that you're writing to the right audience, thinking more about writing papers versus previously, we talked more about race emails, memos.

14
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:56,110
We'll talk a lot about our online presence in online networking and how we can

15
00:01:56,110 --> 00:02:00,879
make sure that we're setting up those networks to really help us in our career.

16
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:09,220
Search or internships, internship search. So we're going to have a few about presentation skills, both about the visual and the oral.

17
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:17,140
And this is really, really, really important for your classes and for when you go into the professional world and especially,

18
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:24,700
I think your 699 professors will be happy that you've gone through these classes for next year when you take that if you're a first year students.

19
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:32,180
And then we'll end with some more about leadership skills and even workplace and or occasion.

20
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:39,160
So I hope that you continue to call and we'll continue to have lunch every Friday.

21
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,439
It's mostly in this room. It's up there. There are a few weeks where we couldn't get this room.

22
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:48,280
So just look at the campus to make sure that you're going to the right spots.

23
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:57,160
We'll also send out those weekly reminders of while you saw a lot of me last semester, I'm going to be reading less of these this semester.

24
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:06,430
And we will be leading many of these weeks with Sebastian and or Brett coming in his wife to talk about writing.

25
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:15,120
Any questions before we get into today's topic? All right.

26
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:18,870
So today we're talking about a space programs.

27
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:23,490
I'm talking about this as I am now, our admissions chair.

28
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:30,360
I've been this is my second year as admissions chair. I four or so maybe a year on the admissions committee.

29
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,990
And so I've also talked with admissions chairs across other biostatistics departments.

30
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:41,370
So I have a lot of knowledge about bio statistics, admissions.

31
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:44,549
I don't have a ton of knowledge about other department admissions.

32
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:53,190
However, I do want to let you know some of the other departments that might be applicable for you if you're thinking about moving on to a Ph.D.,

33
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:59,790
but not necessarily bio stuff. So we're going to discuss our degree options.

34
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,409
I want to take a little bit of a reflection and pause and discussions.

35
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:10,620
Think about, you know, why is it that you might want to pursue a Ph.D. to think about the reasons behind that motivation?

36
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:19,740
Think about pros and cons. If this is something that you're trying to decide right now and then if you want to consider moving forward,

37
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:26,640
then we'll talk about the application requirements. And I have several tips for the application process.

38
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:36,869
So and actually this is not Non-exhaustive list for sure, but these are programs that you might be considering.

39
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:41,580
You're all getting a masters of biostatistics, however, you might decide that, well, I like bias.

40
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:47,180
I want to continue that or I like biased out, but I really like to go into a different discipline.

41
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:52,350
So you might be thinking about moving some of those things together in statistics.

42
00:04:53,010 --> 00:05:00,840
Many, most of our students stay in bio. They continue on to Ph.D., but other students sometimes go into computer science or bioinformatics.

43
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:05,129
I don't know of a ton of data science Ph.D. programs.

44
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:09,180
However, they probably are popping up these days. Also,

45
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:14,249
several of our students move into an epidemiology Ph.D. So these are all sort of like the

46
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:20,309
closest degrees for which you might be considering if you're considering a PhD degree.

47
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:24,240
And this list some maybe differences and overlap.

48
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,110
There's a lot of overlap, but obviously some differences.

49
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:36,989
Well, between degrees and programs, all of you are getting an amazing degree with your master's in biostatistics.

50
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:42,480
So I want to make it clear that it's not that you I'm not telling you, you need to get a PhD.

51
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,280
You shouldn't feel like you have to get a Ph.D., right. This is just an option.

52
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:54,179
You can see that actually in the list of best graduate degrees from Fortune magazine and PayScale, they list a master's and bios.

53
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:57,299
That is the number to best degrees you get.

54
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:01,440
So you're all getting a very great foundation, a wonderful degree as it is.

55
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:05,310
And they actually listed a Ph.D. in statistics as number one.

56
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:10,290
Interestingly, masters in applied math is number eight and master's is this is number nine.

57
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:19,890
And so they are one of these that a doctorate in statistics leads to a career with lower stress.

58
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:22,980
I'm not really sure what they're comparing that to, to be honest.

59
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:29,640
I don't know where that comes from. But I think that's why they they they're trying to say that's why it was number one.

60
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:34,829
And then just a little bit about, you know,

61
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:42,630
there's a lot of job opportunities if you decide to move your visa or if you decide to have your master's and go out into the job world.

62
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:51,749
According to Glassdoor 2020, these careers had some of the highest ratings,

63
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:56,970
which were based on the number of openings, salary and overall satisfaction ratings.

64
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,680
So a data scientist, a machine learning engineer, a data engineer or a data analyst,

65
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:07,500
all of which you'd be able to go into a career with that title with your Masters Degree help.

66
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:13,980
U.S. News reported the number six the number eight jobs were data scientists and statisticians,

67
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:21,930
and the Bureau of Labor Statistics anticipated data related occupations will grow more than 31%.

68
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:34,050
And 81% of all data science and analytic job postings feature uber years of higher experience, and the higher paying ones require a masters degree.

69
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:42,840
So again, master's degree, phenomenal degree, and so many opportunities and amazing degrees that lead to a fantastic job.

70
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:56,219
This is also also Wilder says hopefully some of you came last semester to the lecture services were very often job postings will say like one

71
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:05,220
year prior experience or three years prior experiences you should apply anyway and they can decide whether they want to interview you or not.

72
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:14,250
This is sort of something that is often put in job postings but not necessarily stuck to you also when you're looking.

73
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:23,690
Career. If you decide to look into careers, make sure that you're looking into broad strokes, not just like biostatistician.

74
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:30,180
So I really like that. I love a lot of this term data athletes, right?

75
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,629
Not just data scientists, but we're data athletes.

76
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:42,380
And so having a degree in biostatistics really kind of combines analytics with the translational component.

77
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:45,830
And if you also have computing and potentially some business skills or some of

78
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:50,660
these professional development skills that we're trying to build in this series,

79
00:08:50,960 --> 00:09:00,700
you know, you're really becoming this amazing data athlete where you can have both sort of like the the methods, right?

80
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:06,650
The skills, math skills, but then also the ability to work with people at work in business.

81
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:17,450
A little bit about where our students have gone. So some of you may have seen this before I presented it previously, but I just wanted to remind you,

82
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:26,179
this is from all of our graduating master's students from 2015 to 2020 and where they went.

83
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:37,070
And so 34% of our Masters students went direct to industry, 25% of them went out, 23% of them went to a Ph.D. at Michigan bio stat.

84
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,480
12% decided to pursue a Ph.D. in another discipline or at another department.

85
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:49,520
So either they went on to biotech at another school or they went into Michigan or somewhere else.

86
00:09:50,030 --> 00:10:00,830
Bioinformatics, computer science or epidemiology being the three most usual Ph.D. degrees sought by our students not going to match by the stat,

87
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,860
20% went into government. We don't know about 7%.

88
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:11,080
They didn't answer our survey and 4%. Oh, sorry.

89
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:16,610
This 20% want to do research universities or hospitals. 4% went into government jobs.

90
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:26,550
So like census or. There other types of snakes and things like that.

91
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:35,370
These are some of the companies and or research institutions for which our our students went with a master's degree.

92
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:40,649
If you're interested, you're thinking about, okay, well, that's great of the Masters, I can do that.

93
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:45,270
Well, what are what can I do with a Ph.D.? So here's where our Ph.D. students have gone.

94
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:52,080
This is a little bit maybe one more year of data sets based on 67 graduating students.

95
00:10:52,470 --> 00:11:04,800
57% of our students went into industries, primarily pharmaceutical companies, some tech companies, 30% went into academia and 7% went into government.

96
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:12,450
So you can see that a lot of our students actually go into industry or government as opposed to academia.

97
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:21,540
We often think that if you're getting a Ph.D., we're sort of craving you to be someone who goes into academia.

98
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:29,930
But that's not really the case anymore. But you can see there's overlap in terms of where our students end up, whether they have a Ph.D. or a masters.

99
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:39,420
I pulled this off of some website. I forget now, and honestly, I think these values are quite inflated.

100
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:45,750
But it's interesting. Maybe we can at least respect the proportions that they have here.

101
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:50,910
They try to show a biostatistician average salary difference by education level in the US.

102
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:55,910
So they say if that you have a bachelors in bio stat, which is very uncommon,

103
00:11:56,010 --> 00:12:02,830
I think only it offers that maybe one or two other places you could start at almost 100 K per

104
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:09,290
year or salary if you have a master's start at 135 and if you have a Ph.D. start at 177.

105
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:13,950
Now, I can tell you that's not where you start as an assistant professor.

106
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:18,360
I'm not even there yet. Okay. So like this is this is highly inflated, I believe.

107
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:26,790
I mean, I guess it depends whether you think about nine or 12 on salaries. So I think these these values are a bit inflated views I took from the ACA.

108
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:35,040
The American Statistical Association has a yearly or I don't know, maybe every other year survey of salaries.

109
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:45,120
And so you can see here, this is for master's degrees, individuals with masters degrees from 2018 and 2020 and they're beginning salaries.

110
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:54,780
So instead of being like 135, you know, they're more in the 70 to 113 range depending upon titles.

111
00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:02,790
And you can see here write general statistics, applied statistics, biostatistics, apparently data science.

112
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:09,870
Maybe it's because there's not as many people but higher salaries for that data science term.

113
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:15,600
So you might really want to be searching for a data scientist as opposed to biostatistician.

114
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,550
You might see a salary difference there when you go out into the workforce.

115
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:30,330
Okay. So I sort of wanted to set that up to say, you know, there's a lot of opportunities whether you get a master's or a PhD.

116
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,750
And we're going to talk a lot more specifics about PGD.

117
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:42,810
But what I found in terms of advising students is that there is often a lot of pressure for a Ph.D. and it's not really clear why.

118
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:52,169
So I want to spend a little bit of time being introspective and thinking about, you know, if I'm why would you be interested in a Ph.D.?

119
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:58,110
So thinking specifically about your motivation or your motive for a Ph.D., you know, what is it that you want to do?

120
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:01,379
Is it that you want to be a professor?

121
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:04,760
And so that's why you need a Ph.D.? Or is it that you want to work in industry?

122
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:09,450
You don't necessarily think it's important to think about the finances.

123
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:16,529
So you do get paid and your program will be paid for graduate school funding for you.

124
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:18,540
But it's not a lot of money. Right?

125
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:32,040
So you're you have to be able to make sure that you can afford that kind of salary for, you know, five, six years and be able to to live with that.

126
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:36,240
And then, of course, there's thinking about pressure and stress, which you have,

127
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,980
I'm sure, now as a master's student, continue to have as a new student.

128
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:48,540
So I, I have index cards and pencils if anyone needs a writing utensil.

129
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:56,860
Alternatively, you can use your computer. But I want you to write down specifically like if, if you're thinking about a Ph.D.,

130
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:08,340
why you might want to pursue the Ph.D. and to also start making like a list of what are the pros of going for a Ph.D. versus what our cons for Ph.D.

131
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:17,430
And I, I ask you to think of at least two pros and two kinds of and continue to populate which other side you're coming up with ideas.

132
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:22,290
And we're going to have a little discussion without. Getting too specific or putting too much on the spot.

133
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:28,110
So I'll just pass these out in case you you want them.

134
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:39,300
Saddam has pencils out, and he has these in these euro on paper pens, if you want to.

135
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:46,750
But I'll give us all, like, I don't know, 5 minutes at least think about this and then we'll talk about it and see.

136
00:15:52,380 --> 00:16:02,260
But. Open.

137
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:20,470
I. Basically.

138
00:16:53,890 --> 00:17:07,020
A little exercise. You.

139
00:18:25,130 --> 00:19:34,170
Yeah, it's. Anyone want to share their motives or reasons for why they want to pursue a Ph.D.?

140
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:39,260
Yeah.

141
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:48,210
So I've been told peace is a way to be the best at something like you might be the only person finding a certain look in a certain area of research.

142
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,710
So, like to be an expert at something and in particular.

143
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:56,850
Yeah. And I guess you could do also do that in industry, but it's not as clear.

144
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:04,610
Yeah. Any other reasons or motives behind you see that?

145
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:12,630
Because I feel like that is because I'm, you know, having so much upper hand on the job market.

146
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:25,270
What else? Other reasons. Yeah.

147
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:29,630
I think for me too. In creative work.

148
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:43,620
Doing creative work. Anything else?

149
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:50,340
Yeah, I think it would be giving them more job security because once you become the expert in some fields

150
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:57,270
and then you would be hired for the first time for any organization to fire you or like they offered.

151
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:04,290
Oh, they could still fire you. I mean, right there in academia, tenure is supposed to be so they can't.

152
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:08,520
But in an industry, they can fire you for whatever they want. I think any time.

153
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:15,060
Yeah. I can spend more time working alone on my research and fitness.

154
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:29,430
Any other reasons why you might be considering a Ph.D.? I know, and I was thinking about it.

155
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:33,840
Part of my reasoning was like, Well, I really like school and I don't know what else I want to do.

156
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:38,360
And so why not just continue in school? Right. And that's also part of the reason why I became a professor.

157
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:41,550
Well, I really like school, so I just get to keep doing it.

158
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:45,180
What about what are some pros?

159
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:54,750
I mean, the motives seem also like pros, but are there any other pros of having your Ph.D. or going to school for a Ph.D.?

160
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:01,410
So if you're into that industry, there's higher starting salaries.

161
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:21,490
Other pros. During the period during during the period, we can accept the more professional guidance from providers.

162
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:41,540
You know, they're pros. Anybody thought of? Yeah, it would be challenging intellectually.

163
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:46,740
Instead of doing a simple look. Challenged you.

164
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:52,930
That's a really good one. Ibeacons.

165
00:22:52,930 --> 00:23:04,060
What are the cons of? How do you think about this sometimes long time time commitment?

166
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:13,270
What else? You know, if you're going to find something interesting in research.

167
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:34,130
Yeah. What else?

168
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:42,340
Yeah. Maybe peer pressure. Like your friends get a lot of money, but you've got to pay a little.

169
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:48,850
Yeah. You become anxious. Yeah, that's the other cons.

170
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:53,860
Yeah, I was a supervisor and did.

171
00:23:55,110 --> 00:24:02,820
We sometimes. Yeah.

172
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:13,240
High stress environment. And Suncoast.

173
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:21,790
What does that Suncoast. I mean, you'll spend more time dividing yourself and we'll go back to drop boxes.

174
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:28,150
If you cannot reach that high level, you may feel those years of old sense.

175
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:39,990
Suncoast Nonprofits. At time, trade off with the job or something.

176
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:49,520
Yeah. You're not going to be paid very well. No, you're not.

177
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:53,590
Yeah, not. Not during the time in school.

178
00:24:53,600 --> 00:25:07,690
Right. You. Any other.

179
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:17,590
We've had some good ones I actually posted, so I didn't.

180
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:24,280
So I don't seem I think what happens a lot is that when you talk to professors, all we know is getting a PhD.

181
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:30,220
And so a lot of what we say seems like it's really trying to get you to get a Ph.D., because that's what we did.

182
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:38,979
And so we think it's great. So I posted on today's In Canvas in the week, there are some readings which really try to show both sides.

183
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:42,220
One of them, in fact, is like why a Ph.D. is not worth your time.

184
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:51,670
And the other one is a survey that nature put out of all early career scientists, asking them about their Ph.D. in their environment and beliefs,

185
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:57,910
and kind of shows both the positives and negatives for what you all sort of nicely laid out here.

186
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:05,850
I think it's just a really good idea to instead of just thinking about what are your peers doing and or what are your parents pressuring you to do,

187
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:09,190
what is it actually that you want to do and why do you want to do it?

188
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:15,240
And so thinking about write a PhD is a really great thing to continue with.

189
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:20,559
If you're really intellectually curious, if you want to continue to be challenged,

190
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:26,560
if you know that there's some research topic that you want to continue and you feel like it's worth,

191
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:35,950
you know, the stress and the low financial support, etc., versus just like, well, everybody else seems to be doing it.

192
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:43,840
I think I might get paid more, right? I think there is a difference in starting salaries, but it doesn't mean that your salary is different.

193
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:50,630
Often people with master's degrees in the workforce can earn as much, if not more, than others who have their Ph.D.

194
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:57,520
This is the this is the nature survey. This is a little bit of what's in it I just wanted to share.

195
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:07,930
So they surveyed over 6300 early career researchers and they asked, how satisfied are you with your decision to pursue a Ph.D.?

196
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:16,860
6% were very satisfied, very dissatisfied, 10% somewhat dissatisfied, 10% neutral, 37% somewhat satisfied.

197
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:20,740
38% very satisfied. So overall satisfied, right?

198
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:27,640
Like the majority is in blue here, but a fair amount of people who wish they hadn't.

199
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:34,719
It seems like and then has your since the start of your graduate school or Ph.D. experience,

200
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:39,040
has your level of level of satisfaction increase worsened or remain the same?

201
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:42,510
This is sort of scary, right?

202
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:50,440
The satisfaction has worsened for almost half the individuals, which is pretty sad, but probably due to the fact that they're like in the thick of it.

203
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:54,129
Right. And maybe experiencing a lot of stress at that point in the survey,

204
00:27:54,130 --> 00:28:02,590
not feeling maybe maybe they're in the thick of it or maybe looking back, they thought, oh, I don't know if I if I knew that.

205
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:06,909
But what I do like over here is what do you enjoy most about life as a Ph.D. student?

206
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:13,450
The intellectual challenge. And I think that should really be a primary motivational factor in whether to pursue a Ph.D. or not,

207
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:15,969
because that's what you're going to be doing day in and day out.

208
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:24,970
Is that that intellectual challenge, the research that takes a lot, that has a lot of ups and downs, but then, of course,

209
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:32,680
working with interesting and bright people, the environment, creativity to consider other professional ideas,

210
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:39,219
etc., that a lot of people have social life, or at least not that they didn't have a social life,

211
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:44,050
but they didn't think of that as like the the best part of their Ph.D. Hopefully they did have a social life.

212
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:48,940
This talks about skills and teaching during a Ph.D. This is not just bio statistics.

213
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:55,000
So this is like over a lots of ideas. But you can see that most people are saying that they during a period,

214
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:02,170
you really understand how to analyze clock data, design experiments, how to present and write submit papers.

215
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:06,250
There's a lot less that you learn in a Ph.D. having to do with business.

216
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:12,760
So, like, you don't really learn how to manage people or manage budgets or create business plans.

217
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:17,260
And that sounds like, well, you don't need to know that a statistician actually, usually you do.

218
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:24,610
Whether you go into industry or academia, you end up having to manage people and manage money and resources.

219
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:30,159
And so those are things that, you know, hopefully we're trying to help a little bit with this professional development course.

220
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:39,310
But also if you continue for a Ph.D. that you try to sort of apprentice your mentor to figure those things out a little bit before you're on the job.

221
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:47,350
Okay. So I'm going to switch gears a little bit. Any questions or thoughts or feelings about what we've gone through so far?

222
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:52,090
I'm going to be more specific from now on really talking about a PhD.

223
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:59,560
So giving you more information about, okay, if you are going to pursue a Ph.D., what should you be thinking about now?

224
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:09,040
This is, again, a non-exhaustive list of schools where. A biostatistics Ph.D. Is University of Michigan being bolded in first?

225
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:12,150
There are lots of grade schools looking to use.

226
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:20,020
This is the first year that the U.S. News World Reports and rankings separated by biostatistics from statistics.

227
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:28,200
And so that is a great place to go. This is a lot of link on the bottom to find the biostatistics tools all by their rankings.

228
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:32,919
Now I will say that ranking is very interesting how they do those ranks.

229
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:36,220
So you probably think it's this very rigorous process. It's not.

230
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:43,150
They send a survey of a list of all these schools to administrative people at the departments

231
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:48,100
of these schools and ask them to rank them and then they compile them and summarize them.

232
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:55,629
So, for example, I filled it out for our department. So you can imagine, right, my bias of all these schools, right.

233
00:30:55,630 --> 00:31:01,660
Was put into the ranking and that happened to every other school, an independent, you know, who knows it out.

234
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:05,229
So I take the rankings with a little bit of a grain of salt, right?

235
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:11,680
Like don't think that you can only apply you should only be applied to the first five or six like, you know, in the top 40.

236
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:17,050
They're all phenomenal schools. It just depends on who filled out this survey.

237
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:22,389
So a lot of really great other schools that you should consider.

238
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:26,920
If you want to go on to a Ph.D., I'll talk about it a little bit more later.

239
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:35,650
But as you all know, we have much larger masters cohorts, but our PhD program has stayed the same in terms of number here at Michigan.

240
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:41,160
And so it's no longer that if you come here for your master's, you'll automatically get into the Ph.D.

241
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:47,130
And so it's really important to be thinking about other schools for which you can apply to if you want to go on to the Ph.D.

242
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:54,160
And then I just have some links here that I'm sure you could get, maybe even better links by Googling.

243
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:57,370
But if you're interested in thinking about statistics, data science,

244
00:31:57,370 --> 00:32:02,770
computer science or bioinformatics programs where you can find some some lists for those as well.

245
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:08,530
I think you all know what we're doing at University of Michigan, but.

246
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:13,850
If you're going to pursue your Ph.D., you're going to be pursuing some topic of research.

247
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:19,600
You're going to be really creating statistical methodology, right? That's what your dissertation is, the statistical methods.

248
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:24,470
But they'll most likely be applied to some medical public health area.

249
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:36,350
And so this list over here is a lot of the areas of research that kind of is both methods areas, but also application areas.

250
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:44,960
And we have some of the world renowned experts in these areas here working on these these problems.

251
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:51,590
One of the amazing things about University of Michigan and what makes our department so strong are our PS2 program so wonderful,

252
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:55,700
is that you don't really need to know what you want to do when you come in.

253
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,410
And once you decide what it is you want to work on, you have somebody who does that.

254
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:05,890
And so it's a great place to be if you kind of want to explore different topics and then figure out.

255
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:16,610
Primarily, I'm talking about Ph.D.s, but I do want you to know that there's this other degree that's called a doctorate in public health.

256
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:20,720
It's a d, r, p, h. There are only a few of these programs.

257
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:25,660
But if you think, you know, I really like biostatistics, I want to get a doctorate.

258
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:31,219
However, I really want it to be very much more applied. I don't really want to be developing a methodology.

259
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:35,370
I want to be applying methodology, but I want to be in a more challenging space.

260
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:42,620
That's what a DARPA degree is. It's a more applied bio statistics doctorate degree.

261
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:51,500
Like I said, there's only a few of those. If you put it into Google, you can find them, I think, if you want to, at Columbia or Yale.

262
00:33:53,060 --> 00:34:00,560
But there is this sort of other option of primarily degrees or doctorates or funded.

263
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:06,500
However, it really depends on the program as to how much work you have to do to get that funding.

264
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:10,120
So in our department, we offer you funding. We do that work.

265
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:17,000
You make that match for you and you make sure that you have that funding match throughout your entire time in the degree.

266
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:23,000
However, there are some programs that say you'll be funded, but when you get here, you have to figure out what that is.

267
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:28,700
And so if you're going to apply to other places, you should, but you should understand their funding model.

268
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:35,060
There's also a lot of different ways in which the funding can come, which I think I'll talk about next year.

269
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:36,769
So, right, funding sources.

270
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:45,480
There are three primary sources here at Michigan and also across biostatistics doctorates and statistics, doctorate degrees.

271
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:50,600
So either you're a teaching assistant or what we call a GSI graduate student instructor.

272
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:55,790
If you go and get a Ph.D. in statistics, this will be your primary funding.

273
00:34:56,270 --> 00:35:02,719
Almost, almost all statistics PhDs are funded via teaching assistant chops because they have

274
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:11,510
large statistics undergrads who need teaching assistants for their courses in Michigan,

275
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:16,520
biostatistics. We primarily fund our PhDs through graduate student research assistant ships.

276
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:23,120
If you go into other departments like there are some GSR issues and statistics as well, but it's less so.

277
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:31,070
Yes, I'm sure you'll work with the faculty member and work on research projects which may or may not be your dissertation.

278
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:35,929
So some GSR issues are for you to work on your dissertation work and some GSR

279
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:42,980
res are along with your dissertation or you'll be doing collaborative projects.

280
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:49,820
And then we also have a few fellowships or training grants and other departments do as well, or other schools.

281
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:54,130
We in particular have two fellowships are training grants.

282
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:58,640
We have a cancer center training grant and we have a genetics and genomics training grant.

283
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:08,390
However, those training grants are only available to domestic students, and that's also usually the same across any school or department.

284
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:14,720
Those training grants are usually funded by the government, which has these stipulations only for domestic students.

285
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:19,980
And I think you all know this as well, but. Right.

286
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:25,710
If you're going to continue on into your PhD, you will expect to do at least another year worth of coursework.

287
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:31,290
If you came right from undergrad, you would essentially do all of the master's work that you all are doing.

288
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:37,379
And then this additional year or two year and a half of coursework coming from our master's program,

289
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:43,470
you'd have at least a year to finish up your credits and then you'd start working on your dissertation.

290
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:52,860
If you go to another program, they may or may not accept your Michigan courses toward your Ph.D. degree,

291
00:36:53,340 --> 00:37:00,330
but you should expect that you'd have to take more courses at another school than necessarily what if you stayed here?

292
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:06,820
No other school or department thinks that the other person's courses were as good as their own.

293
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:10,509
Right. So that's what happens is you say, well, I took all of these at Michigan. It's a great department.

294
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:15,340
They'll say, Well, it's not our probability series, so you better take it again.

295
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:22,540
So that often happens, of course, that your Ph.D. is primarily focused on your dissertation,

296
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:29,980
write your thesis, and this is where you work with at least one, if not a set of faculty mentors.

297
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:32,620
I personally really like the co advising model.

298
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:45,310
So for all of my students, I have I have myself and one other faculty mentor, but some faculty just work directly with one on one on the dissertation.

299
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,899
Here's where you're making creative and significant original contribution to

300
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:53,800
the field of biostatistics statistics and or statistics or computer science.

301
00:37:54,790 --> 00:38:00,040
For biostatistics, you're developing and evaluating bio statistical methodology,

302
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:06,550
and you have to have some sort of like public health motivation or application with those methods.

303
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:15,300
For us and at Michigan, we primarily think of this as a chapter dissertation plus an intro and conclusion are

304
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:19,660
your three chapters are three separate papers that may or may not be on the same topic.

305
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:23,290
So it might all come together under some specific topic.

306
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:28,030
Or it might be that you worked on three very different projects,

307
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:36,639
but they're all three methods projects and you can put that together under one dissertation while you have one main advisor or two co advisors.

308
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:42,850
Potentially you have to form a dissertation committee and that occurs after you've passed her

309
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:47,950
qualifying exams and you're really working on the dissertation and you form this committee.

310
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:50,860
It has to have at least three,

311
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:59,709
I think it's usually three Bialystok faculty and then one non-biased faculty at Michigan has to be a Rackham appointed faculty,

312
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:03,280
meaning it can't be someone from the med school unless they have a joint appointment.

313
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:13,269
It's usually someone in another speech department from statistics or potentially someone from med school,

314
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:22,300
pharmacy, school or ESR if they have a joint appointment with like a faculty as part of you.

315
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:31,419
Once you've passed your qualifying exams and you've finished your courses, you pass your qualifying exam.

316
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:36,670
So you become what's called a PhD candidate and you have to propose your decision

317
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:40,450
or you're supposed to propose your dissertation within two years of that,

318
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:46,450
and actually you should really do it sooner. Proposing your dissertation is supposed to say, Hey, these are the projects I'm working on.

319
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:49,780
Maybe one of them's done, and here are the other two ideas. Let me get feedback.

320
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:55,150
This is supposed to be like a somewhat formal but also informal discussion with your

321
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:58,450
committee to make sure that you're on the right track and you can get feedback.

322
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:05,860
Unfortunately, what's happened in the last decade here is that students are almost complete with everything they propose,

323
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:09,490
and then a few months later, they defense. That's not supposed to be what happens.

324
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:15,730
The proposal is really supposed to be much more soon and a chance for your committee to have input.

325
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:22,219
And so then you would defend that would be your ultimate end of the Ph.D., right?

326
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:26,860
You do these three chapters. That doesn't mean that those three chapters are published.

327
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:36,159
It just means that those chapters are complete tension and you have an open to the public defense where you orally,

328
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:40,840
visually present your dissertation to your committee and to any others who come.

329
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:48,040
All right. So that's a bit about what a PhD entails.

330
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:57,790
Any questions? I want to come back to that a little bit, but I now want to talk about specifics for the admissions process.

331
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:01,389
So all of you went through the admissions process to the Masters.

332
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:05,410
Some of you may have even applied to the Ph.D. and we said, Oh, you can come to our masters.

333
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:15,390
The admissions process is essentially exactly the same as when you applied to the Masters, but you'd be filling it out that you'd want to get a Ph.D.

334
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:23,470
So what we're really interested in are your math backgrounds, your grades, specifically your masters coursework and grades, your GPA.

335
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:29,890
You still need three recommendation letters. I'll talk more specifically about about each of these as we go through.

336
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:37,990
You have a statement of purpose, also a personal statement. You know, we have clearance for our degrees.

337
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:41,709
You order that you already did had those programs to get into the Masters.

338
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:52,110
So there's nothing else that you necessarily need. Technically, we say we require advanced calculus, but you can take that when you start the page.

339
00:41:52,120 --> 00:42:00,780
Do you like math? 451 You don't have to have it in order to apply and then we no longer require and or get.

340
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:09,850
Look at the Greens. Most schools that I'm aware of are also not requiring or looking at the Greens however you want to.

341
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:14,110
If you're going to apply to a program, you want to make sure that you know what that school is.

342
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:20,140
Because I think there are some schools who say it's optional. So you could decide whether you want to take it or not.

343
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:24,880
Even if you take it, we can't see the scores. So they're not in our decision at all.

344
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:38,660
Obviously these are all online. The sooner you can start to look at different schools and what their requirements are, the better for you all.

345
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:42,130
If you're interested in applying to the Ph.D., right, you'd be doing that.

346
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:46,329
So winter fall, right?

347
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:50,470
The fall semester of 2023. So this fall is when you'd really be getting into it.

348
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:58,420
I would suggest that if you're really thinking about a Ph.D., you start looking this summer, late summer at the programs and their requirements.

349
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:04,270
They're probably pretty much all the same. But you just want to make sure that you don't need anything else.

350
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,489
You have all of your materials from your masters. Don't just use those, okay?

351
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:15,130
Update them so you can use some of that information. But you want to actually go through and update your statement on purpose,

352
00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:19,389
make sure you have updated letters of recommendation and updated personal statement.

353
00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:27,220
That's all going to now include your you know, what you have to say after a year and a half of your Masters program.

354
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:34,080
If possible, I suggest that you apply to as many schools as possible.

355
00:43:34,290 --> 00:43:38,909
Now, every school, every application costs money. There's application fee involved there.

356
00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:43,920
So it's not the most financially feasible thing to do.

357
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:50,280
But if you really want to get a PhD, you cast a wide net and and see what happens.

358
00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:52,680
I also recommend that if you have any questions,

359
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:59,630
you contact the administration or professors or current students and ask those that you make sure that you go to their open house,

360
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:03,610
like fall open house, things that any departments will have.

361
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:08,670
We always have ours and like, I don't know, September, October, a lot of them are virtual now,

362
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:17,730
so they're very easy to to go to and that you listen to their admissions individual giving you their tips and their process.

363
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:27,540
All right. So I'm going to go through all these requirements a little bit more detail. Excuse me, but not too much notice for already late on time.

364
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:29,780
So classes and grades are important.

365
00:44:29,790 --> 00:44:35,010
We care less about your undergrad now that you've had a masters, so we're more interested in your master's grades.

366
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:38,680
We're much more interested in the obviously, like,

367
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:45,930
core courses and related statistics courses that if you took like and you did really poorly in some bioinformatics class,

368
00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:52,979
but you're applying to bio stat, it won't matter as much if there is any class in which you've got a low grade.

369
00:44:52,980 --> 00:45:01,080
Like, for example, I know that a lot of times in like 651 or 650, there is a lot there are some low grades because of X, Y or Z.

370
00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:07,050
You want to address that directly in your statement of purpose or personal statement or cover,

371
00:45:07,170 --> 00:45:11,430
you know, anywhere on the application and just say like, this didn't go so well for me.

372
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:16,440
I was acclimating to graduate school or they gave out a lot of low grades or whatever.

373
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:25,350
You know, you just want to address it and say why that happened. Your GPA is important, however, is not the only thing.

374
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:30,420
What's considered a low grade? Oh, that's a good question.

375
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:34,440
I would I would say that like A, B and below should be explained.

376
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:44,050
But GPA is really important. But that's not the only thing we're looking at, especially University of Michigan.

377
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:49,889
If you spent your master's time here, we're also interested in your general departmental citizenship.

378
00:45:49,890 --> 00:45:54,360
Like how have you added to our department outside of just coming to the classroom and showing up?

379
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:59,010
Are you involved in departmental committees?

380
00:45:59,010 --> 00:46:02,190
Are you going to departmental events?

381
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:08,400
Are you helping out with like prospective student day or admitted students day, etc., etc.?

382
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:11,879
And then also, you know, research experience is a plus,

383
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:18,930
but we know that you can't all get it because we have such large cohorts and most students are not funded.

384
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:23,430
However, you know, we don't you don't have to have a GSA to get in.

385
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:29,880
It's helpful. You've had sort of like hourly job or if you get a summer internship between your first and second year,

386
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:39,060
if you have any opportunity to work with STRATCOM or some other department in terms of some collaborative research or methods research, that's all.

387
00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:42,420
That's all plus, but it's not required.

388
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:49,980
Your letters of recommendation, I would suggest that at least two of these come from Michigan professors.

389
00:46:50,190 --> 00:46:57,030
So it's fine if you had some undergrad professor that you wrote you this amazing letter and you want to continue that, that's fine.

390
00:46:57,270 --> 00:47:01,690
But definitely ask for at least two updated letters that deal with, like,

391
00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:07,800
what you've done here to make sure that we have this like current updated version of of how you died.

392
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:14,100
You might want to have a letter from a summer internship or from a research experience if you had that.

393
00:47:14,430 --> 00:47:17,670
Otherwise, you could have, you know, one from somebody in the past.

394
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:24,989
It's also really helpful, I think, to to meet with professors and to talk about your interest in the Ph.D. and to say,

395
00:47:24,990 --> 00:47:31,620
you know, like to think I'm suited for this. Where do you think? Do you know programs that would be particularly good for me.

396
00:47:32,130 --> 00:47:39,000
And just get some direction and can a conversation about, you know, the opportunities that exist.

397
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:42,870
The more you can provide your professors writing letters, the better.

398
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:49,320
So if you've had time to write your statement of purpose and you can get that that in your transcripts,

399
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:52,690
they can just write a little bit more about you than necessarily, you know,

400
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:57,510
you are in my class and you got a you want to try to choose the letter writers for those

401
00:47:57,630 --> 00:48:02,640
that you like did more write them a little bit more than just you've showed up to class,

402
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:08,219
maybe you went to office hours or you worked with them on something.

403
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:12,450
Or, you know, the more the professor knows you, the better that letter will be.

404
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:15,060
So if you can't think of anybody right now,

405
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:22,080
your work for the next year is to make those relationships with our professors that you can get good, good letters.

406
00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:25,270
Your statement of purpose.

407
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:31,410
This is technically I think the description was concise, well written statement of all your academic and research background,

408
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:36,309
your career goals, and how this graduate program will help you again.

409
00:48:36,310 --> 00:48:39,880
Update this from your master's and include experiences from your master's degree.

410
00:48:39,890 --> 00:48:47,290
So what is it in the last year, year and a half that you've been doing that makes you want to continue on with the PhD?

411
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:53,140
Is there somebody you've worked with or some class you've had that has made some impression on you that you want to move forward?

412
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:59,290
Always you'll have at least one paragraph that's specific to the program to which you're applying.

413
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:04,420
If you just have one generic statement of purpose that you tag on to everything and never say,

414
00:49:04,690 --> 00:49:08,440
I'm applying to Michigan because X, Y and Z, I want to work with X, Y and Z.

415
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:12,550
It's not as meaningful to us. So it's much better, right?

416
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:17,920
If you for every single every single application, you tailor that statement of purpose just a little bit.

417
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:25,420
At least one paragraph. I see so many applications that are just like, I've always loved math, I've always liked numbers.

418
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:28,480
You know, I think I wrote that in mine, but don't just write that.

419
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:32,410
Make it more personal, more unique, you know, what about you is unique.

420
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:37,450
If you can do something in your statement of purpose or personal statement that is like unique or interesting,

421
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:46,240
it will you will be astounded by how much somebody on the committee is like, oh, yeah, that's the person that wrote X, Y and Z, right?

422
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:50,020
So like, if you can say anything that's a little bit unique about you,

423
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:54,400
the more memorable you be, the easier it is to have the committee members think about you.

424
00:49:56,410 --> 00:50:00,399
It's also really helpful to think about when you're writing this, like, well, where is it that you want to go?

425
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:01,660
What is it that you want to be,

426
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:08,080
and how is it that the program is going to help you get there and so that can help you in tailoring your your statement.

427
00:50:09,850 --> 00:50:13,360
So just sort of like general tips, avoid these generic sentences.

428
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:21,130
I love statistics, I love research. You know, make it very specific about you and how that will help you get to where you want to go.

429
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:28,000
If there are multiple tracks to delineate your interests, you don't have to know exactly what you want to study.

430
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:34,150
That's okay. But if you do have an idea or you have an idea of like three or four topics, write that down.

431
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:38,410
Write down the faculty members who study that and say, I might be interested in working with,

432
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:42,730
you know, ABC or not, none of these are going to be a contract.

433
00:50:42,730 --> 00:50:43,180
Right?

434
00:50:43,450 --> 00:50:50,200
But the more specific you can make it, the better in terms of we can see that you're really interested in this sort of research on our departments.

435
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:56,889
And then, you know, if you do this early and then ask people to read it so you can ask me to read it,

436
00:50:56,890 --> 00:50:59,110
you can ask the admissions committee members to read it,

437
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:07,870
but potentially your advisor or professor, if you really like to go to the writing center a page, ask your friends to look at it.

438
00:51:07,870 --> 00:51:15,099
Your family, you know, just ask people to look at it to help you with like the grammar and and editing.

439
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:18,639
But then also to think about like, oh, is this unique? Could this stand out?

440
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:26,920
Or how could that be a little bit better? Your personal statement is also sort of thought of as some and some other places.

441
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:31,380
It's specifically a diversity, equity and inclusion statement. This is a personal story.

442
00:51:31,390 --> 00:51:34,480
It's meant to be shorter. It's not meant to be. Don't copy and paste.

443
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:41,410
Your statement of purpose is intended to focus more on perseverance, overcoming obstacles or challenges.

444
00:51:42,130 --> 00:51:46,810
If you have any interest or experience with diversity, equity and inclusion to include that,

445
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:54,640
it's a great place here to to showcase any departmental citizenship or other volunteer or citizenship type things that you've done.

446
00:51:55,990 --> 00:51:59,500
And it's not really meant to be academic or research based.

447
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:03,280
It's really supposed to be more personal for us to get to know and remember you.

448
00:52:08,070 --> 00:52:12,220
So the more research you can do and the more specific you can tailor the application, the better.

449
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:19,290
Although I know that takes time and the more information you can get, the better you can figure out if that's a good match for you.

450
00:52:20,430 --> 00:52:23,880
And again, to make sure that you visit these these open houses.

451
00:52:25,950 --> 00:52:32,939
So my tips for you all to get ready to apply at this stage if you're thinking about applying,

452
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:37,229
is to do well in your courses and to be active in those courses.

453
00:52:37,230 --> 00:52:43,680
So get to know your faculty. Don't make it just this transaction of I come to class or I watch class online.

454
00:52:44,550 --> 00:52:49,650
You know, really actually talk to your faculty, go to office hours, ask them questions.

455
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:55,500
The more that people know your name, the better. Although maybe I should rephrase that.

456
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:58,980
So the more we know your name in a positive way, the better, right?

457
00:52:59,010 --> 00:53:05,310
Don't just annoy faculty, because that will be good. So don't just try to, like, ping them all the time or show up unannounced, right?

458
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:18,720
Like, make sure that you're doing this in a professional manner in which you're not over, over energetic or overdoing the communication.

459
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:21,630
Also, be active in our department again.

460
00:53:21,630 --> 00:53:27,630
The more that we know that you're helping the department, that you're in a committee or you're, you know, helping us with events,

461
00:53:28,470 --> 00:53:34,500
the more we can tell that you're really sure you're engaged, you're interested in the environment and making it a better place.

462
00:53:37,670 --> 00:53:42,080
Specifically making it clear about why you want that program at that school.

463
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:48,530
Describing any background, current and future goals and specific interests or faculty is helpful.

464
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:52,370
Getting people to read it to make sure that you're writing clearly and well,

465
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:59,479
and then choosing your faculty writers based on those who can write more than just like they were in my class.

466
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:07,460
They got an A break. You want to have at least, you know, one, if not two of your letters have more substance than that.

467
00:54:08,570 --> 00:54:13,430
And then, you know, people say, okay, well, is GPA the most important is your letter is most important?

468
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:17,900
I can't answer that question. It's all really important. This is a holistic review.

469
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:20,930
We look at your entire application. It's all taken together.

470
00:54:22,310 --> 00:54:26,629
And so it's there's no one thing that I can say.

471
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:34,910
This is exactly what you need to focus on, right? You need to do the best that you can, you know, and all the aspects.

472
00:54:34,910 --> 00:54:39,890
But don't worry, if all the aspects aren't perfect, right? They're going to one's going to they're going to balance each other.

473
00:54:42,410 --> 00:54:45,550
Specifically, there are all these myths about our admission.

474
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:51,050
You have to do research. You have to have a chance or a job to become you have to have all pluses.

475
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:56,230
There's a lower threshold for domestic students. We have a specific international student quota.

476
00:54:56,240 --> 00:55:00,820
These are all false. These are all myths. Urban legends don't listen to your classmates.

477
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:06,020
Every year I find out new urban legends and this that go around that I just don't know how they talk to me.

478
00:55:06,710 --> 00:55:07,700
These are all false.

479
00:55:08,030 --> 00:55:19,310
So we're looking for for people who are really interested in being challenged and intellectually curious, who are good departmental citizens.

480
00:55:19,670 --> 00:55:27,319
You know, it's not that we have quotas or that we have specific different criteria for different people.

481
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:29,840
That's not what it is. It's just really holistic review.

482
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:38,240
And we consider everyone I know we're getting over time, but I just want to show most people are interested in these numbers.

483
00:55:39,950 --> 00:55:44,870
In the past, a lot of students who applied master's students who applied to get into our party because

484
00:55:44,870 --> 00:55:51,829
we had smaller master's cohorts and not everyone would apply in the last few years,

485
00:55:51,830 --> 00:55:57,920
that's not the case. So in 2020, 21 of the 36 that applied were accepted.

486
00:55:58,250 --> 00:56:02,690
In 2021, 1813 of the 18 were accepted.

487
00:56:02,690 --> 00:56:11,659
But this was a really small class. This year we have 46 of the 92 of our six year master's students who applied to our program.

488
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:16,070
And I can tell you that less than half of those individuals will get into our PhD.

489
00:56:16,730 --> 00:56:20,780
So it's not the case anymore that if you are in a master's program,

490
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:24,799
you will get into our Ph.D. because our master's program is so large and our program

491
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:29,090
stays the same because the funding depends on the number of graduate students,

492
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:38,750
the faculty, the grants, etc. And so every year we have on average about 20 slots and that doesn't change based on the master's students.

493
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:44,240
And so we're not only interested in our internal students for we're also interested in external students.

494
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:52,639
So not saying any of this to scare you, but what I'm saying is for reality and also for you to know that don't just focus on Michigan bias said,

495
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:59,270
okay, make sure that you have your options open, that you can cast a wider net if possible.

496
00:56:59,270 --> 00:57:01,130
If you're worried about application fees,

497
00:57:01,790 --> 00:57:07,760
ask the programs if they can be waived and or come to me and or someone else in the department and we can try to help with that.

498
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:12,950
But if you really want to pursue a Ph.D., I think you can just might not be at Michigan.

499
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:21,930
Okay. So then if you do a few points, if you do get a Ph.D., how do you choose an advisor?

500
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:26,610
There are two techniques either based on the topic area or based on wanting to work with the person.

501
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:33,930
So either, you know, you want to do like genetics and you find that person or you know you want to do clinical trials or you're like,

502
00:57:33,930 --> 00:57:38,460
Oh, I don't really know what I want to do and I really want that class with Professor X, right?

503
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:42,390
I luckily had I chose an advisor based on both.

504
00:57:42,870 --> 00:57:46,080
It was a topic that I liked. I really liked him as an advisor.

505
00:57:46,290 --> 00:57:51,310
This is my advisor. Will head. You can see I'm towering over him. I also worked with his wife.

506
00:57:51,330 --> 00:57:54,690
They came to my wedding. She's like, constantly keep in contact with them.

507
00:57:55,030 --> 00:57:58,410
This is the relationship that you have for five years is pretty important.

508
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:04,260
So it's really it's really important thing to try to figure out how you're going to choose your advisor.

509
00:58:04,290 --> 00:58:08,970
Remember, your research advisor. Just advisor doesn't have to be your dissertation advisor.

510
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:17,300
And so you want to think critically about that. That's really probably overkill.

511
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:20,950
I just want to make sure that you know that like, you know,

512
00:58:20,950 --> 00:58:26,870
you need to think about your life outside of school because there will always be these pressures.

513
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:31,810
Make sure you have other interests. So, for example, in graduate school, I found I really loved yoga.

514
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:36,040
I went to hot yoga. I did that as my escape. I met my husband there.

515
00:58:36,850 --> 00:58:40,110
He had a cat. We got a dog and we had kids. Right.

516
00:58:40,130 --> 00:58:43,420
So it set up my life of this other thing outside of school.

517
00:58:44,710 --> 00:58:48,340
So just make sure that you always have something to balance your school. This is the last thing.

518
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:53,559
What should you do? Don't start stressing about the future now, please.

519
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:58,690
There's too much pressure. Your first year still of the master's program.

520
00:58:58,990 --> 00:59:02,260
Please focus on your masters and really focus on learning.

521
00:59:02,410 --> 00:59:06,190
You're not just trying to get a pluses. Focus on setting up that foundation.

522
00:59:06,190 --> 00:59:13,900
Because regardless of you get a Ph.D. or if you go into the job, you're actually trying right now to gain all those skills to use in the workforce.

523
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:17,260
It's not just trying to get into the next thing or do the next thing.

524
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:21,490
You're actually trying to use to find the skills that you're going to use the rest of your life.

525
00:59:21,970 --> 00:59:26,710
So please focus on the learning. Don't focus on just getting that grade and going to the next step.

526
00:59:28,270 --> 00:59:33,780
Apply here if you're interested, but also apply elsewhere. Just because you don't get in here, that doesn't mean you're not smart or talented.

527
00:59:33,790 --> 00:59:36,100
We just the numbers just aren't there too small.

528
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:45,759
And then if you don't get into the Ph.D. program next year, you know, in the spring, you're plenty of time to look for a job.

529
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:51,219
And like, we saw so many opportunities with with great career choices and salaries as well.

530
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:56,590
So do not think that the Ph.D. is like the be all end all of of what needs to happen.

531
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:02,620
All right. So focus on the now. Be curious. Seek to learn and understand.

532
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:08,709
And please don't focus on competition. You're not competing with your classmates for the Ph.D. You really want to focus

533
01:00:08,710 --> 01:00:12,100
on collaboration because ultimately these are going to be your colleagues,

534
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:18,429
whether you got a Ph.D. or whether you go on to the workforce. And so you want to think about building those skills now that you're going to use

535
01:00:18,430 --> 01:00:23,140
later and making those friendships which you can call upon at any point in the future.

536
01:00:23,770 --> 01:00:32,620
So it's really about collaboration, not competition. And these are two articles about how we really need to think about now.

537
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:36,460
Not like, Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, think about now, right?

538
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:40,870
Like negativity, the stress that comes along with the future. And I remind myself of this all the time.

539
01:00:42,220 --> 01:00:46,360
It's just really important to not get too caught up in that.

540
01:00:47,170 --> 01:00:50,290
Thank you so much for coming to this first professional development.

541
01:00:50,290 --> 01:00:58,640
I hope you come every Friday checking on this. Take more food if you'd like, and I will continue to see you throughout the semester.

542
01:00:58,660 --> 01:00:59,380
Welcome back.
