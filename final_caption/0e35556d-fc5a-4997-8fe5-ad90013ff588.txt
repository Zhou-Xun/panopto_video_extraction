00:00:48,290 --> 00:01:00,560
such as your instructors and contact information, the course structure, the grading policy.

10
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:11,070
Of course, policies. And the course schedule.

00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:20,020

17
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:06,780

18
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:14,010
as well as the individual unit pages, which will review in a moment.

22
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:45,830

25
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,890
so be sure to read through each week carefully and thoroughly.

26
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:19,080
The basic structure of each week's unit includes some online lesson quizzes, some readings.

27
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:25,040
And the discussion informs some topics with the direct link to access them.

28
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:36,720
When assignments are due, such as quizzes, exams or writing assignments, they can be accessed from here or the left side panel that reads assignments.

29
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,860
You can check out your grades right below that, under the grades link.

32
00:03:56,090 --> 00:04:05,320
Well, that concludes our campus course tour. If you have any questions and I advise you, take a look at the syllabus first.

33
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,970
If your questions cannot be answered.

34
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:14,470
They're both free, though, to contact one of your instructors Anglicize either through email or by taking advantage of their office hours.

35
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:21,640
We also where the GSA is, we'll use our campus site to post announcements and relevant materials to their specific section.

36
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:27,467
So be sure to check our campus often and regularly. Happy learning and go blue.
