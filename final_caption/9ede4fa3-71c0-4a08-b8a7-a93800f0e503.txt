00:00:05,765 --> 00:00:06,460
Hello.

2
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:10,500
This lecture will cover inference for
binary and categorical outcomes.

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,400
This topic will discuss
a two-sample test of proportions.

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,110
In this example, we have two populations
that we want to compare to each other.

5
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:20,685
We have an intervention population,

6
00:00:20,685 --> 00:00:24,590
a population of infants who have been
exposed to an intervention that hopefully

7
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:28,050
will impact their risk
of developing cavities.

8
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:29,930
And we have a control
population of infants,

9
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:33,400
infants who have not been
exposed to the intervention.

10
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,350
We follow the infants for
two years, and our interest is in

11
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:41,190
how many of the infants in each population
will develop caries or cavities.

12
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,630
So like with the two sample t-test,

13
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:47,020
we get samples of data from
each of the populations.

14
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:51,910
From the control population,
I gather data on n1 infants.

15
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:55,810
In this population, we assume that
there is a value p1 that denotes

16
00:00:55,810 --> 00:01:01,020
the actual proportion of infants who
will develop carriers within two years.

17
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,640
We also collect a sample of data
from the intervention population,

18
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,430
a total of n2 infants.

19
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:08,860
Again, n1 does not have to
be the same number as n2.

20
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:13,795
And in this population, we assume there
is a value p2 that denotes the proportion

21
00:01:13,795 --> 00:01:19,461
of infants in this group who will
develop caries within two years.

22
00:01:19,461 --> 00:01:21,860
We have a null and alternative hypotheses.

23
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:25,260
The null hypothesis is that
the two populations are same

24
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:29,740
with respect to risk of caries,
or that p1 is equal to p2.

25
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:33,232
Equivalently, we can say that
their difference is equal to zero.

26
00:01:33,232 --> 00:01:37,242
The alternative says that the two
populations are different with respect to

27
00:01:37,242 --> 00:01:43,714
risk of caries, or that p1 is not equal to
p2, and that their difference is not zero.

28
00:01:43,714 --> 00:01:46,997
In the sample of control infants,
I have 36 infants, and

29
00:01:46,997 --> 00:01:50,570
ten of them were observed
with caries after two years.

30
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:54,380
And in my sample of 68 infants
from the intervention population,

31
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:58,050
I observed six of them to develop caries.

32
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:02,100
To do a hypothesis test,
I need estimates of p1and p2.

33
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:06,420
My best estimates are what I observe
in my data, so that an estimate of p1,

34
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:11,410
that we denote as p1 hat,
is the ratio of 10 to 36,

35
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:15,550
which is 28% of my sample.

36
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:19,040
I also have an estimate for
p2, which I denote p2 hat.

37
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,740
This is the observed rate of caries and
the intervention sample.

38
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:27,560
That rate was 6 over 68, or about 9%.

39
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,221
I will also have to use a value shortly,

40
00:02:30,221 --> 00:02:34,344
that denotes the overall
incidence of caries in the sample.

41
00:02:34,344 --> 00:02:38,634
If the two populations are truly equal
when the null hypothesis is true, then I

42
00:02:38,634 --> 00:02:43,460
can combine all of the area into one
group to get an overall rate of caries.

43
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:47,520
Our signal is the observed difference
in proportions, which is 0.19,

44
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:52,430
a rather large difference in the rate
of caries between these two samples.

45
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:55,445
However, this difference will
vary from sample to sample.

46
00:02:55,445 --> 00:02:59,446
So I need an estimate of noise that
quantifies how much variability I might

47
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:03,140
see in this value from sample to sample.

48
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:06,860
The formula you see in front of you
is the computation of the noise.

49
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:10,920
It looks similar to the estimate of
the noise in a two sample t-test.

50
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,340
It is a sum of two numbers,
one from the control group and

51
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,240
one from the intervention group.

52
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:21,847
Again, this computation uses the overall
observed rate of carries in the sample,

53
00:03:21,847 --> 00:03:25,225
which was 16 infants out of 104, or 15%.

54
00:03:25,225 --> 00:03:30,839
Plugging in the values into this formula,
I get an estimate for the noise of 0.07.

55
00:03:30,839 --> 00:03:34,799
So therefore, my signal to noise ratio,
my test statistic,

56
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,950
is 0.19 divided by 0.07, or 2.71.

57
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:41,270
In other words, the difference
between these two proportions and

58
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:45,870
my sample is almost three standard
deviations away from zero.

59
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:50,120
Like the two sample t-test,
I need a reference distribution for

60
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,850
my observed test statistic.

61
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:54,510
For this test,
we again use a normal distribution.

62
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:59,220
And therefore, I take my test statistic
of 2.71 and I see how much area is to

63
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:03,390
the right of that number and how much
area is to the left of negative 2.71,

64
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:08,210
in a normal distribution with mean zero,
and standard deviation of 1.

65
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:14,620
The yellow area is a total of 0.007 of the
entire area of the normal distribution.

66
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,620
And this is my p value.

67
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:20,000
Because this p value is quite small and
less than 0.05,

68
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,560
we have strong evidence that the rate of
caries differs between the control and

69
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,470
the intervention populations.

70
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:32,760
Now, instead of doing a p-value, I could
also compute a 95% confidence interval for

71
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:36,430
the actual population difference
in the risk of caries.

72
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:40,362
And that confidence interval,
again, is the signal plus or

73
00:04:40,362 --> 00:04:45,221
minus 2 times the noise,
which is 0 .19 plus or minus 2 times .07,

74
00:04:45,221 --> 00:04:49,637
giving me a 95% of confidence
interval of 0.05 to 0.33.

75
00:04:49,637 --> 00:04:53,830
Again, this confidence interval does
not contain the null value of zero.

76
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:57,240
And therefore, we conclude that we
have enough evidence that, in fact,

77
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,320
there is a difference in the risk of
caries between these two populations.

78
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,250
Hopefully through this example you
have seen how the two sample test of

79
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:08,470
proportions looks very similar
to the two sample t-test.

80
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:11,260
This is an example of how the central
limit theorem allows us to

81
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:15,650
use the normal distribution for inference
even when the outcomes are not normal or

82
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:17,950
are, in fact, binary.

83
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:21,551
However, there is a more commonly
used test with binary data known as

84
00:05:21,551 --> 00:05:26,426
the Chi Square Test of Association,
which we will cover in another segment.
