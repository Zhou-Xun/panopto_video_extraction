1
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:14,890
All right, good morning, everyone. It's getting dark and windy and the storms are upon us, right?

2
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:20,700
And then it looks to me like in the 50s starting tomorrow, right? Yeah, it's going to be very cold.

3
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:31,750
All right. So without further ado, we have a tropical expert with us today, one of my colleagues in environmental health sciences, Professor Auroral.

4
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:37,540
She helps lead the occupational health program with her department.

5
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:44,410
And she has a lot of really cool background around occupational health, occupational exposures.

6
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:50,420
And I'm not going to go into great detail on that. I'm going to let her talk a little bit more about herself as part of the lecture.

7
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:54,220
But thank you so much, Dr. Fleischman. Hello.

8
00:00:54,220 --> 00:01:00,790
Good morning, everybody. I see one familiar face, but it's hard to tell with the masks.

9
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:04,330
So, you know, before I introduce myself, just carries a show of hands.

10
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:18,100
How many of you are in your first year of your masters? OK, so this whole class, basically just general AHP is kimmich.

11
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:22,340
And that's what I'm missing.

12
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:32,720
We have students and, oh, OK, OK, we have several students that are in occupational health nursing program are mostly the ones that are joining.

13
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:38,020
OK, asynchronously. OK, well, hello everybody.

14
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:47,140
This is I'm kind of new as well. So like Dr. Darvon said, my name is Aurelie and I started here in the fall of 2020.

15
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:53,650
So this last year has been like entirely remote for me. So this is my actually my first time being in this classroom in particular.

16
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:58,420
It's a neat setup, but, you know, you know, in a normal world, it would be full of people.

17
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:03,730
But we are so a little bit about me.

18
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:08,470
I am a certified safety professional and certified in public health.

19
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:15,640
I got my mph at the University of Nebraska Medical Center and community oriented primary care.

20
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:25,300
And while I was there, I happened to be a grad assistant for the Nebraska biocontainment units, which you might fall through a half full rescue.

21
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:31,420
And that's kind of how I got catapulted into the world of infectious diseases and highly infectious

22
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:36,490
diseases because I had an opportunity to become a research assistant while I was there.

23
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:41,890
And I was really focused on health inequities and health inequalities.

24
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:49,780
And then I started doing this very like industrial hygiene, occupational health role, which I was like, yeah,

25
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:54,520
that's great, because it's a great assistantship and it's paying for my tuition and I'm getting a stipend and all that.

26
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,840
And of course I'm going to do it.

27
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:05,140
But I felt so torn because, you know, even though public health in the last, you know, five to 10 years is trying to be more interdisciplinary,

28
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:12,070
sometimes it's still really siloed in terms of like, you know, the nutrition folks, the nutrition folks and so on.

29
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:17,920
So I kind of felt like the train my my roots because I'm drifting away from community health.

30
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:25,480
But then I started to realize that there's a lot of disparities in occupational health as well and communities that are overlooked.

31
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:32,890
So I wasn't like totally abandoning that. And so that's how I kind of got catapulted into the world of infectious diseases.

32
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:43,720
And then I went off to work at Indiana University to manage this grant and got my PhD part time, which I don't recommend you doing that.

33
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:48,880
I think both Dr. NEITZEL and I did that and both of us would not recommend that.

34
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:53,170
But my doctor was actually in health behavior with a minor in environmental science.

35
00:03:53,170 --> 00:04:01,750
So kind of focused more on, you know, the aspects like psycho social aspects and occupational health psychology.

36
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:13,000
But today, I'm here to talk to you about occupational exposure, limits and issues in agencies, which is admittedly a little bit more of a dry topic.

37
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,300
But I know it's early in the morning, so we'll try to keep it as entertaining as possible.

38
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:25,600
But feel free to just raise your hand or comment or anything at any given time.

39
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:35,590
OK, so let's get started and I'll try to keep keep keep an eye on the clock because sometimes I talk the whole time.

40
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:42,230
OK, so we're going to describe the scope, dimensions and trends of occupational exposures and diseases,

41
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:48,850
understand the agencies and organizations here in the United States that and internationally that establish

42
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:57,670
occupational exposure limits and then understand why Odell's for short differ between agencies and organizations.

43
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:02,650
So I updated this meme from what Rick had, but I realized that, like,

44
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:08,500
I'm probably dating myself because how many of you actually know who this is OK with?

45
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,370
Most of you, OK? That's Dr. Evil. So from Austin Powers.

46
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:20,410
So it's it's really a common opinion about occupational safety, where people say safety first in theory,

47
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:24,280
but in practice and a lot of businesses and organizations,

48
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:30,160
usually they're kind of thinking about the day to day functioning or the bottom line before safety.

49
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:38,170
I think an interesting part, potentially positive aspect that has come out of the covid-19 pandemic is now there

50
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:46,450
is so much emphasis and focus on worker health that really wasn't there previously.

51
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:50,950
So why do we care so much about occupational exposures?

52
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:59,590
So this is some updated data. And of course, we're talking about the known direct cost right now of things like covid-19.

53
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:04,810
But this is likely a gross underestimation. So in the last year,

54
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:12,510
about six hundred and ninety thousand people died from heart disease and that cost about four hundred and forty four billion dollars.

55
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:17,690
That's chronic. Right. And then cancer was about five hundred and ninety eight thousand.

56
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:27,410
And that was about a hundred and four billion dollars, so the number of people from last year that they can attribute to getting covid

57
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:32,060
directly from the workplace is about three hundred and seventy five thousand.

58
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:38,750
Although at this point today where we are, there's about almost 700000 deaths in the US from covid.

59
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:47,750
And it's estimated that the direct and indirect costs in the last year of covid was 16 trillion dollars.

60
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:54,080
So what I mean by direct and indirect costs, direct costs are things like medical care,

61
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:59,930
medications, you know, potentially like monoclonal antibodies and things like that.

62
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:05,330
But the indirect costs are like lost productivity, time off of work,

63
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:13,130
potentially like short term or long term disability for people who have long haul covid and all these additional factors,

64
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:19,130
how covid has affected the economy more or less that go into this.

65
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:25,040
And then the annual occupational fatalities that we had, again, pre covid,

66
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:35,030
we've had about four to six thousand injuries a year in the workplace and about forty nine to sixty thousand illnesses.

67
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:42,260
And globally, you know, in places outside of the United States where occupational health protections might be less,

68
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:45,930
about two million people die annually due to their workplace.

69
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:58,430
So it's still a very much a pervasive issue. And then you can see in the fatalities in the workplace, in the U.S., it took a slight dip after 2008.

70
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:05,240
But as we get into the graph for 20, 20, once they collect that data, I'm sure that will increase sharply.

71
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:12,230
And then we see a growth in fatalities as well. And a lot of these trades like construction, but I'm sure as, again,

72
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:18,050
they update this data, a lot of front line occupations will be right along with that.

73
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:24,080
Yes. That figure for how much it cost. Is that so?

74
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:31,850
Is that the cost per year for only the people who died or for everyone forever?

75
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:42,020
For everyone regardless. Yes, yes or no.

76
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:46,280
That's that's more acute. So if it is chronic, for example,

77
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:55,730
like just say you're a construction worker and you've been chronically exposed to asbestos over time and you've reported that to your employer,

78
00:08:55,730 --> 00:09:00,470
that would be counted in with the data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

79
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:05,120
But where the ball gets their data from is directly from the employers.

80
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:11,360
And what they have these they're called OSHA 300 logs where you have to document illnesses and injuries.

81
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:19,160
And then if a worker, for example, poses like I think this chemical is potentially like causing my cancer,

82
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:28,250
they actually have to keep those documents and records for up to 30 years because those exposures take so long to manifest.

83
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:37,060
But just say, for example, you know, like you're a bus driver and you have heart disease, you may not necessarily report that to your workers.

84
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:42,620
So this is based on just the data that the PLO has. Great question.

85
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:54,740
Others, yes, we come fired and they're like, oh, yes, yes.

86
00:09:54,740 --> 00:10:05,630
So you can't discriminate against a worker based on their, like, disability status, mental health, chronic diseases or anything like that in theory.

87
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:08,870
Right. So we'll get some more of that in a little bit.

88
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:16,220
But if we if I if we don't cover it in a satisfactory way when we get to and bring that up again.

89
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:23,990
Thank you. So many diseases. When they first started out, they were named for what they were first noticed in.

90
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:32,000
So usually we don't use these kinds of terms anymore because according to the World Health Organization for Best Practices,

91
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,480
for diseases, we try to avoid, like calling it specific occupations,

92
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:45,410
specific geographic regions or specific like racial or ethnicity groups, like, for example,

93
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:54,560
we wouldn't necessarily call this minor's asthma today, like we wouldn't call covid China virus for socio cultural implications.

94
00:10:54,560 --> 00:11:05,480
But at the beginning, when occupational health was starting to become like a more persistently studied or researched or documented field,

95
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,570
they would call it that.

96
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:14,390
So they have something called bagas itch as well, which is an eczema that you get when you come into contact with baked goods.

97
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:18,210
They have things like popcorn, lung. Actually,

98
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:28,710
so so workers who work in factories that are like Orville Redenbacher and they manufacture those popcorn bags that you pop in your microwave at home,

99
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:37,040
the synthetic butter that they use in it, there's a component of it that's known to cause bronchial constriction in workers.

100
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:43,500
So they started calling that popcorn lung. So this is just an example of a few.

101
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:55,080
And so occupational health by the numbers, there were approximately a hundred and fifty seven million workers in the workforce in 2013.

102
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:59,880
So the population of the United States is like three hundred fifty million ish.

103
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:07,680
But you have to take into account how many of those are like children, for example, that aren't the legal age that are able to work.

104
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:16,740
How many of those are people who are retired, for example, or how many of those people are not participating in the workforce for various reasons?

105
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:22,560
Perhaps they are taking care of children or doing some other type of thing.

106
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:30,160
But in 2008, we had about 2.8 million work related injuries and illnesses here in the United States.

107
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:35,370
So that's about one hundred workers a week dying from acute injuries.

108
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:42,720
So acute injuries. There's like I fell off the sixth floor of a building when I was working on something on there

109
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:48,930
or like I got electrocuted while trying to restore power to this neighborhood after a storm.

110
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:58,770
So those are considered like acute injuries. So that breaks down to about 14 deaths per day, which kind of still definitely seems like a lot.

111
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:05,850
Or like construction workers on the highway getting killed by motorists who are speeding.

112
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:09,750
So in recent times,

113
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:19,560
they are now classifying covid-19 as an occupational illness or something that the employer would be able to record on what I was referencing earlier,

114
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:28,230
which is this OSHA 300 law. So the OSHA 300 log every year between the month of February and April.

115
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:35,700
Employers have to submit this data to OSHA and then they keep track of everything and then you could potentially get audited.

116
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:48,390
But with how pervasive covid has been throughout our country and how even like some localities and states now have given up on contact tracing,

117
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:57,330
the number of employers keeping up with covid illnesses or suspected infections in their workplace is likely to drop as well.

118
00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:07,560
But, you know, it's definitely for sure a huge problem in the workplace because this article that came out from the CDC between April and May of 2020,

119
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:14,430
about 16000 thousand workers in meat and poultry processing facilities were, in fact, in covid-19.

120
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:21,870
And having still, like a lot of colleagues who work at Nebraska Med Center and they do a lot of work in Nebraska and Iowa,

121
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:27,600
there are a heavy concentration of meat and poultry processing plants there,

122
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:35,010
and they employ a large number of refugees and immigrants because interestingly, in Omaha,

123
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:40,710
Nebraska, they're one of the top cities that resettles refugees here in the United States.

124
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:46,440
So a lot of them, as their first job, end up going to meat and poultry processing plants.

125
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,660
So they were trying to keep up with production.

126
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:57,870
But in these poultry processing plants, you have anywhere between several hundred to a thousand workers in a really confined space.

127
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:00,420
And they weren't being given adequate PPE.

128
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:09,450
And because, you know, turnover is so high, if someone is not able to work, they easily replace something like that.

129
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:14,250
So there are a lot of investigations that were done last summer in these particular facilities

130
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:21,240
just because of the egregious lack of occupational safety and health protection for their workers.

131
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:29,910
That's not only like a worker health issue, but also a social justice issue as well.

132
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:38,550
So just taking a look all the way back 20 years ago, I believe, 20 years ago in 2001.

133
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:47,190
So there used to be like about, you know, 94 percent of the injuries were from private industry.

134
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:55,920
And then you had a good chunk of illnesses and then you had some like other stuff going on, like disorders associated with repeated trauma.

135
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,850
That's not psychological trauma. That means like bodily trauma.

136
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:07,320
So if you think about repetitive motion, carpal tunnel, musculoskeletal disorders, lower back pain,

137
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:17,630
those kinds of things, skin disorders and diseases and then all kinds of other illnesses were lumped into there and.

138
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:22,220
Here's the number of illnesses in private industry by the type of illnesses.

139
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:27,740
So it's basically like another way to represent what we've seen before.

140
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:39,410
And you'll notice that the greatest chunk is disorders associate associated with repeated trauma between 1972 to 2001.

141
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:46,010
And since that 20 years has passed, musculoskeletal disorders are still a huge,

142
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:52,460
huge issue here in the United States, and largely because we haven't addressed that.

143
00:16:52,460 --> 00:17:02,690
It's contributed to feeling the opioid epidemic as well, because a lot of workers who work in like construction or these very physical jobs,

144
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:11,960
for example, because of the work culture here in the United States, you don't necessarily get a lot of PTO or you don't take a lot of time off.

145
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,370
So when you go to the doctor,

146
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:22,190
you want a quick fix and you want to get back on the job to make money so you don't lose your job or you don't lose that job security.

147
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:27,410
So during this time, there was a rampant overprescription of opioids,

148
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:36,320
things like Vicodin, OxyContin, Percocet, essentially like very addictive painkillers.

149
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:41,270
And so since we've known that the opioid epidemic has exploded,

150
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:46,730
they've really tried to curb pharmacists or physicians from prescribing these medications.

151
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:53,570
But nowadays, because people can't get their prescription opioids, which they become addicted to,

152
00:17:53,570 --> 00:18:03,590
and it can take as little as like two weeks, depending on factors like your biology, your environment, etc., Some people are just skipping.

153
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:12,560
My partner works in addictions counseling, so some people now are just skipping the opioid prescription when they get at work and just going right to

154
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:21,500
heroin because it's more it's cheaper and more readily available because heroin is very similar in composition,

155
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:31,520
as an aside. But for these meds, interestingly, when we talk about Occupational Safety and Health Administration or OSHA standards,

156
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:43,010
there is no standard for ergonomics. So they try to get a standard for ergonomics back in 1999 and 2000, basically,

157
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:50,510
that would require work employers essentially to assess the ergonomics of their workplace,

158
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:55,910
make sure that the workers had the right tools or like physical capacity or

159
00:18:55,910 --> 00:19:00,920
even like stretching and therapies to make sure they perform their job safely.

160
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:05,780
And unfortunately, that was shot down by Congress in 2000.

161
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:12,380
So we still don't have an ergonomics standard today as a sneak preview of our standards.

162
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:21,710
But we'll talk about that in a little bit. So the 10 most deadly occupations in the U.S. in twenty twenty.

163
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:26,390
Any guesses for what they might be? Lumberjack.

164
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:32,740
OK, yes. Electrician. OK.

165
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:43,000
Other thoughts. Yes, a truck driver like a like a semi or a CDL, OK?

166
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:51,490
Yes. Health care workers, that's. Yeah. Fisherman.

167
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:56,230
TV, yeah, the deadliest catch. Yeah, I don't watch those, but I know of it.

168
00:19:56,230 --> 00:20:01,360
Yeah, thank you. Yes. So we're going to go down the top 10.

169
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:06,970
So this is, again, direct from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, number one, logging.

170
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:16,030
So we got it right, Josh. So they fatality rate for this in 2020 was ninety seven point six per 100000 workers.

171
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:23,790
So there is 56 deaths last year. Number two, phishers and related fishing workers.

172
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:32,620
So that fatality rate was seventy seven point four per 100000 workers with 30 deaths in 2020.

173
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:42,070
Then we have aircraft pilot and engineers at fifty eight point nine deaths per 100000 workers with 70 in 2020.

174
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:49,360
Number four is roofers with fifty one point five per hundred thousand ninety six deaths.

175
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:56,710
Number five, actually, interestingly, is like refuse and recyclable material collectors are garbage collectors.

176
00:20:56,710 --> 00:21:06,040
In other words, at forty four point three per 100000 workers, truck drivers and other drivers,

177
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:15,220
we have a fatality rate of twenty six out of a hundred thousand workers and nine hundred sixty six deaths in twenty twenty.

178
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:20,320
So they did have the highest number of fatalities in any job.

179
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:29,410
But because there are so many more workers who work in truck driving, for example, compared to logging or compared to fishing,

180
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:36,220
when he standardize that per one hundred thousand workers, that's why they fall at number six and not number one.

181
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:41,800
But if we're looking at the actual number of deaths, they are the highest.

182
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:49,060
Then we have farmers, ranchers and agriculture. So this is about twenty four point seven per 100000 worker.

183
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:59,470
And nowadays we're moving toward a lot more commercial farming rather than like, you know, small farming or what they call like hobby farms,

184
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:05,110
which are ones that you're not necessarily producing acres and acres and acres of soybeans.

185
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:09,490
But tractor rollovers are still really dangerous today.

186
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:18,250
And unfortunately, a lot of people still suffocate in corn or grain silos because when you're in a corner grain silo,

187
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:23,140
you're supposed to wear a harness attached to you as you go towards the center,

188
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:29,740
because once you go into the center of the silo, it kind of has like a quicksand effect where you can sink in.

189
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:37,360
And there's always a couple of people every year in Nebraska who die from suffocation in a silo.

190
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:48,460
Then number eight, we have iron and steel workers at twenty three point six per hundred thousand fifteen deaths and twenty twenty first construction

191
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:57,310
or extraction or anybody who works in that trade at twenty one per one hundred thousand one hundred forty four deaths last year.

192
00:22:57,310 --> 00:23:03,670
And then lastly, ground maintenance workers at twenty point two per hundred thousand.

193
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:10,450
This one is kind of interesting because you think, OK, someone's who's mowing the lawn in the neighborhood is obviously not at risk.

194
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:18,790
But talking to some of my colleagues who used to work in risk management and safety insurance,

195
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:25,690
one of the top companies that's really, really nobody wants to insure is No.

196
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:31,090
One ziplining companies because so many accidents happen all the time.

197
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:43,990
But No. Two are actually the contractors who mow the medians on interstates and highways because they keep getting killed.

198
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:52,300
So it's a really high risk industry, especially when you're working in that kind of like commercial or interstate setting.

199
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:57,500
But again, these fatalities are like directly attributable work.

200
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:09,940
Right. So, like, you know, so-and-so was mowing on ninety four and a person was like, you know, texting and then like killed them.

201
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:16,510
But they're not taking into account things like covid because as we can imagine,

202
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:23,800
if we looked at health care workers, for example, they would be like way up there after this year.

203
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:38,240
Yeah. So this is just showing this is from 2016, the number of and rate of fatal work injuries by industry sector.

204
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:47,180
And so based on what we know about all these fatalities, right, obviously nobody wants these workers to die.

205
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:52,640
They all have family, friends, loved ones that also don't want them to die.

206
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:58,280
So why don't we improve our occupational health policies and regulations?

207
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:01,770
So it's a difference of science versus policy.

208
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:08,870
So science, we're really interested in understanding cause and effect and policy is dealing with reality.

209
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:15,590
So as you being, I'm sure, active citizens here in the United States and people in public health,

210
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:22,430
you know, that policy is so difficult to change and it takes a really long time.

211
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:25,370
So we have this problem, right? Just say, for example,

212
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:35,840
high fatality rate among construction workers and we know what we know from the sciences and then we know what we know from the reality.

213
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:43,520
But how do we marry the two to create a standard that kind of Panopto appeases both?

214
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:51,920
That's the tricky part. So occupational exposure limits, how do we decide how they're set?

215
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:56,250
So with that, we take into like risk, policy and risk.

216
00:25:56,250 --> 00:26:00,500
So we're trying to find factors that influence decision making.

217
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:10,160
So how much of it is a controversy? For example, how much of it do we have like significant evidence for?

218
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:15,110
Do people accept the risk for this population or not?

219
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:19,850
And is it feasible really to implement this kind of standard?

220
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:24,740
So. Let me think, for example.

221
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:32,120
So Josh is in my seminar where I talk about nail salon workers, you know, like, for example,

222
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:38,660
I would love for nail salon workers to be mandated to have a bloodborne pathogens standard

223
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:45,140
because sometimes they deal with cutting like skin or biological agents like fungi,

224
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:51,110
or sometimes when they're performing a manicure, pedicure, somebody actually does start bleeding.

225
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:55,820
But there's no bloodborne pathogens standard applied to that industry.

226
00:26:55,820 --> 00:27:05,540
It's usually in health care workers. So how feasible would it be economically and technically to apply that standard to that industry?

227
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:11,240
This is where it gets all kinds of complicated and very muddy.

228
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:17,000
So within the United States, we have governmental policies essentially.

229
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,910
So we all know laws. You have to follow the law. So this is created by like legislature,

230
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:29,430
funded by the executive office and interpreted by judiciary or the Supreme Court, if you happen to get to that point.

231
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:34,700
And regulations are detailed policies on implementation of law.

232
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:44,270
So this one can be regulated in similar ways to a law where there are like tangible consequences if you don't follow the regulation.

233
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:51,950
And then we have all kinds of things like guidelines or directives where like you should do this, it would be nice if you did this,

234
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:58,760
but if you don't do this, no one's going to come and, you know, slap you on the hand for not doing it.

235
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:03,920
And then kind of like in this middle area are our mandates.

236
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:12,910
Ideally, mandates should be with regulations and laws, but it totally depends on the enforcement of it.

237
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:21,010
So U.S. regulatory agencies, so for occupational safety and health, we have No.

238
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:32,620
One, OSHA, which was developed in 1971, and they are like the premier only regulatory body in the United States for occupational health.

239
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:40,690
And they primarily focus on non-governmental workers, meaning those who work in the private sector.

240
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:47,770
Then we have the Department of Labor, which they focus more on miner safety, health and administration.

241
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:56,740
Just because of the occupational needs and demands of miners are a little bit different than the general, what we call general industry.

242
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:59,290
And then we also have the Department of Transportation.

243
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:07,420
So they're in charge of the transportation of hazardous materials and then the Federal Aviation Administration and Railway Administration.

244
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:17,230
So they cover any worker safety that happens essentially more or less in the air or by rail and then and then also on the road.

245
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:27,000
And then you have the Department of Defense and they are responsible for the occupational safety and health of those in all branches of the military.

246
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:37,530
So then we have this other one, so the Oche Act was created or passed in 1970 at the end of 1970,

247
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:42,750
interestingly, by President Nixon, who people don't think fondly of.

248
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:46,890
But this was like a good kudos to him for something nice that he did.

249
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:57,570
So the Asharq created OSHA, but it also created the National Institute of Occupational, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.

250
00:29:57,570 --> 00:30:05,940
So OSHA is seated within the Department of Labor, whereas Naish is under the National Institutes of Health,

251
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:15,850
under the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. So they are part of the CDC and they don't have any regulatory power at all.

252
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:21,120
They're primarily thought of as like the research branch of occupational safety and health.

253
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:27,630
So diving further into specific worker industries and what their issues are,

254
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:36,540
they also have a personal protective equipment technology lab where I don't see anybody in this room wearing and ninety five.

255
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:43,740
But usually if you have personal protective equipment, all of it is certified and tested by Nawash.

256
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:47,790
And given that nine hour seal that's like literally on your and ninety five and

257
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:52,320
they do all kinds of fun stuff there where they like stretch out the material

258
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:57,990
and expose it to different environments in a lab setting and test it with oils

259
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:05,460
and different exposures to see how efficacious essentially all this PPE is.

260
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:13,790
They're usually more on the cutting edge than OSHA because they are so devoted to research and keeping practices up to date.

261
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:23,460
Back in that in a minute. And there's also the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry that's also within there as well.

262
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:30,420
So like I was saying earlier, the ASH Act of 1970 established by OSHA Naish,

263
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:39,450
they also established this other agency called Oche RCU, which is the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission or council.

264
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:50,160
But basically what they do is they're more like the legal bodies. So if an employer gets cited, for example, or if they want to dispute that citation,

265
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:57,480
they can go to the ICRC for like a legal review and then they can dispute it in court that way.

266
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:04,560
But what OSHA really what they were trying to do was create a statutory general duties

267
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:11,880
to provide safe and helpful workplaces and employer adherence to specific standards.

268
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,550
So isn't a while to think that, you know,

269
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:23,640
maybe not see wild like we went all through the Industrial Revolution and all the way until 1970 here in the United States,

270
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:28,290
and we didn't have anybody regulating worker health.

271
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:41,620
So like any thoughts about why this did happen in 1970, then, like why that Josh was.

272
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:46,920
Yeah, yeah. That's a part of it. It was linked to the landmark environmental laws that came out.

273
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:54,490
Other thoughts? Yes or no?

274
00:32:54,490 --> 00:33:01,540
You don't trust the government. Yeah, so after some more efforts, we don't trust the government as much as we thought we did.

275
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:06,460
Those are definitely actually huge, the huge two parts of it. So it's like, oh, you nailed it on the head.

276
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:10,810
So this was after. Well, not after is still going on a little bit.

277
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:23,620
But the Vietnam War, there was a lot more advocacy here in the United States and conversations about policies and politics in general.

278
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:32,500
And so, yes, a lot of the environmental movement and the EPA stuff was happening at this time, which certainly helped fuel this alarm.

279
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:39,980
And then, you know, Vietnam as well. And people starting to ask, like, why isn't the government looking out for us on this thing?

280
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,800
So we definitely need it.

281
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:51,730
And another thing was that during the civil rights movement, mostly, you know, reaching its peak in the nineteen sixties and then still ongoing today,

282
00:33:51,730 --> 00:34:00,610
though, of course, like that, stimulated a lot of conversation about basic protections and rights for people in all facets of their lives.

283
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:04,240
So the workplace also happens to be one of it.

284
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:13,120
So we do have regulations for various industries and generally, if you see them labeled at any given time,

285
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:19,270
they have a twenty nine in the front of it for twenty nine code of federal regulations CFR.

286
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:27,220
And then anything that starts with a 1910 means that its general industry, anything that starts with a 19, 15 to 19,

287
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:34,390
18 means it's for maritime or longshoremen because they don't follow necessarily the same same standards.

288
00:34:34,390 --> 00:34:41,950
Nineteen twenty six is construction and then nineteen twenty eight is agriculture.

289
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:53,140
So there's also something called the General Duty Clause in OSHA, which is basically that employers must furnish his employment,

290
00:34:53,140 --> 00:35:00,280
essentially a place free of recognized hazards that are likely to cause death or serious physical harm.

291
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:05,620
So basically, like non malfeasance from the employer is what they're trying to get at.

292
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:13,450
So if you're the employer and you know, like these certain things, are these certain processes can harm or kill your workers.

293
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:25,450
You're trying to minimize that as much as possible. And when there's a hazard and that's recognized, for example, there's either two options.

294
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:32,080
There is an OSHA standard or there isn't an ocean standard, which is very binary.

295
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:40,070
So we have tons of standards for various chemicals or known physical hazards.

296
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:46,000
So we have a standard for asbestos, land, chromium, cadmium.

297
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:53,750
Those are all heavy metals, benzene, which is a known human carcinogen pattern dust.

298
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:58,690
Don't worry about the numbers for these, you know, asbestos and shipbuilding.

299
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:06,130
So because that's happening on Maritime Longshore, that's 19 1915 rather than 1910 as the prefix.

300
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:14,920
And then you have asbestos in construction, heavy metals in construction, and then you have things like ventilation, for example,

301
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:18,820
or if a worker is in a spray booth doing some spray,

302
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:25,660
finishing with flammable or combustible materials, we have some regulations or standards for that.

303
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:34,840
So usually within that regulation or standard, they might talk about the hazards, but also what kind of processes are record keeping.

304
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:41,740
The employer has to have the type of personal protective equipment that needs to be given to that worker in order to

305
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:51,880
do that process safely or equipment if it's not PPE training that they must receive in order to do this process.

306
00:36:51,880 --> 00:37:02,320
So if you Google right now, like nineteen ten ninety four and you curious, you'll probably reach the OSHA website.

307
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:10,840
And it's like this law, a very long essay, more or less, that people have to sort through.

308
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:16,120
And in any given workplace, like multiple regulations can apply.

309
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:23,020
So you can imagine that. How how in-depth are employers realistically looking at this?

310
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:27,100
They they know the basics, right, because they don't want to get in trouble.

311
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:34,540
But a lot of the regulations for things that are more nuanced aren't necessarily adhered to.

312
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:44,750
Like a hundred percent of that make sense. And then we do have some regulations on personal protective equipment, general requirements.

313
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:51,440
I emphasize protection, respiratory protection, footwear and gloves.

314
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:56,870
So an example for this, like if you worked in a hospital or health care setting,

315
00:37:56,870 --> 00:38:08,570
you might have all of these PPE regulations applying to your health care facility and the employer has to give you the PPE at no cost.

316
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:14,660
So I'm originally from California and my mom still works at a nursing home.

317
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:25,640
So during the covid pandemic, we found out that her nursing home facility was not only charged not only providing their workers any PPE,

318
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:32,540
they were also charging them for PPE, which is not it's not right.

319
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:40,370
I wouldn't say it's illegal, but it's not right. And the argument is and was at the beginning of the covid-19 pandemic,

320
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:48,800
is that long term residential facilities and like nursing homes don't actually count as health care facilities, which is wild.

321
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:56,030
Right, because they did provide some health care services. But that's kind of how some of them get away with these kinds of things.

322
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:59,930
So because I do what I do and my sister is a lawyer,

323
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:08,300
we filed a complaint with Cal OSHA and her workplace had a surprise inspection from the Department of Health.

324
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:14,960
And so after that, originally they were you know, they had cloth masks and surgical masks,

325
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:23,270
but they were charging 15 dollars if the worker wanted to buy it, a kit that had a ninety five and cloth coveralls.

326
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:27,620
And my mom's like, I'd rather just pay the fifteen dollars and feel a little bit safer.

327
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:31,950
And I was like, no, no, no. Like, you're not paying for this. And also like you're unionized.

328
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:38,840
So we're calling your union. And so after that whole snafu and it wasn't just us whistle blowing, there are a lot of her colleagues.

329
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:49,370
Whistle blowing They gave them all T-shirts that said they were heroes and then they gave them cloth reuseable masks.

330
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:55,590
But a lot of these industries, for example, where do you think these regulations would apply?

331
00:39:55,590 --> 00:40:06,260
They don't always necessarily you know, so like let's think of like another high exposure front line industry here throughout the pandemic,

332
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:12,440
like grocery store workers, for example, none of these regulations actually apply.

333
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:20,030
So they're having to follow what they're like city or county mandates are in regard to masking.

334
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:27,230
Same with like people who work in restaurants or a food service and things like that.

335
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:39,170
They also have regulations about record keeping. So surprisingly, there are standards about sanitation and what the quality of lunchrooms can be like.

336
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:47,750
But I'm sure we've all worked in places where the lunchroom was kind of sketchy but also or nonexistent.

337
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:53,870
For example, like I said, back to my thing with nail salon workers, when they al-Salam workers,

338
00:40:53,870 --> 00:41:00,440
a lot of their lunch rooms are the stock room where the chemicals are capped and they have an autoclave in there,

339
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:12,230
but they also have a microwave and a fridge for employees to keep their food, if even and those don't necessarily follow the standards for lunchrooms.

340
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:14,630
But again, it's not really regulated there. Right.

341
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:23,930
And then they have standards for record keeping and reporting and then access and monitoring medical data like we were mentioning earlier.

342
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:36,170
So just say, like, I'm working in, like tech and Silicon Valley and they're just say I'm looking like Tesla or something like that.

343
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:46,370
And they're trying out this new spray paint on the car surface that's been specially formulated for like these new Tesla cars.

344
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:54,320
And five or ten years from now, I like to start to get negative health symptoms.

345
00:41:54,320 --> 00:42:05,420
And I say to my employer, like, hey, I think Chemical X that we've been using to spray these Teslas is potentially giving me cancer.

346
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:10,940
So based on nineteen, ten, ten, twenty, they because they've reported that to their employer,

347
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:15,200
the employer now has to keep a record of it and essentially monitor data.

348
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:23,730
And the nice thing about this is that you don't have to have any previous scientific evidence that this chemical causes

349
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:29,480
some this health effect because sometimes they are so novel that this might be the first time it's being brought up.

350
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:36,950
And then they do have to monitor that data for at least three decades just because how long things to manifest.

351
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:43,130
So they also have non chemical hazard regulations as well.

352
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:47,540
So a big area that Dr. NEITZEL does is focused on physical hazards.

353
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:51,340
So there's standards on how much noise you can be exposed.

354
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:59,930
You know, work day as an employee and how much ionizing and non-ionizing radiation as well.

355
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:11,600
And it gets even more complicated. So OSHA, essentially their job is to overlook the 50 states, but the states,

356
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:18,950
because of federalism here in the US, can opt to have their own state approved OSHA plans.

357
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:22,730
So what does that mean? It means that states have two options.

358
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:30,680
I follow what the OSHA regulations are and we're just going to stick with federal OSHA or OSHA.

359
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:37,640
Fine. But I would like certain regulations to be stricter than what they have because I don't think there's sufficient.

360
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:44,630
And if they're stricter than federal OSHA, they are allowed to have their own state approved plan.

361
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:52,400
So the ones in the dark blue dark were the ones that are like medium to dark blue.

362
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:56,360
Those are state approved things, but they all have state approved plans.

363
00:43:56,360 --> 00:44:03,560
But the very light blue, they don't have state approved plants. So California, for example, in California,

364
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:13,580
very strict regulations most of the time above federal OSHA and on par with what Naish actually recommends here in Michigan.

365
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:21,050
We have Mioshi as well. So they are a bit stricter on certain regulations and standards than federal OSHA.

366
00:44:21,050 --> 00:44:27,590
But, you know, when I was living in the Nebraska, for example, they did not have their own state approved plan.

367
00:44:27,590 --> 00:44:33,460
So they just kind of went with what feds said. Yes.

368
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:48,920
So you see this in action because you don't know where you live.

369
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:55,550
So if you have a state approved plan, that means they are monitoring the occupational safety and health of the workers.

370
00:44:55,550 --> 00:45:02,630
They are more strictly because they have a specific workforce that does do inspections and audits, all these kinds of things.

371
00:45:02,630 --> 00:45:06,080
So, Josh, don't answer this next question, because we talked about in a seminar,

372
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:11,540
but so we have about one hundred and fifty seven million workers here in the US.

373
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:17,720
How many OSHA inspectors do you think we have in this country?

374
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:27,040
Just a guess. Just start some guesses.

375
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:40,120
Five hundred others, other guesses, a thousand, a thousand similar to another guess what the price is right here.

376
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:45,710
OK, you guys are actually like a little bit more pessimistic.

377
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:56,950
Usually people are more optimistic. It's about like two thousand. So we have about like 2000 OSHA inspectors for like millions and millions of people.

378
00:45:56,950 --> 00:46:03,730
And as you imagine, over the years, OSHA has been continuously defunded,

379
00:46:03,730 --> 00:46:09,880
although depending on the administration like the fist, their fiscal year budget can change.

380
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:16,030
But for the most part, OSHA really only has their eyes on those like high risk industries.

381
00:46:16,030 --> 00:46:22,930
So we're talking oil, mining and gas, for example, where there's always some kind of accident or explosion,

382
00:46:22,930 --> 00:46:28,120
construction as well, since they go across the industries.

383
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:37,720
So really, the only time OCE is going to, like, pop up and surprise you and inspect you is if you have a whistle blower complaint.

384
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:41,020
And usually that has to be initiated by the worker.

385
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:50,290
But so many people, you know, don't believe OSHA is effective and can actually do something or they're worried about retaliation,

386
00:46:50,290 --> 00:46:57,430
for example, so they don't file a complaint or multiple people have to file complaints.

387
00:46:57,430 --> 00:47:04,390
But then usually those things more end up on like a class action lawsuit sides rather than the OSHA side.

388
00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:13,030
So their resources are spread super thin. But here in Michigan, we have our own inspectors.

389
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:19,720
But the interesting the interesting thing is that when someone comes up and they're like,

390
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:26,710
I'm with my OSHA, I'm here to inspect our facility, the employer can actually decline there.

391
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:30,280
But that with the caveat there, like, I'm not ready today.

392
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:38,860
Right. But then they have to pick a date to reschedule. But obviously, you know, when they reschedule, everybody's on their best behavior, like, oh,

393
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:44,940
let's just kick these, like, knives on the ground, you know, under the table or whatever.

394
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:52,850
Yes, no doubt about that.

395
00:47:52,850 --> 00:47:56,750
She's for the last three.

396
00:47:56,750 --> 00:48:03,970
It was for safety. Yeah, I would say those businesses, that is a factor for it.

397
00:48:03,970 --> 00:48:08,380
But a lot of the reasons where they pick their locations are for tax purposes.

398
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:17,260
So a lot of businesses are go to Texas because they don't like charge a lot and property tax and other taxes.

399
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:22,540
But now for various reasons, you know, we won't necessarily discuss here today.

400
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:26,380
A lot of companies are deciding not to set up in Texas anymore.

401
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:34,180
They're moving out of Texas. So a lot of it is mostly big tax tax reasons, worker safety and health.

402
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:41,110
You know, you know, it's not like the priority. But, yes, you do see a lot of these.

403
00:48:41,110 --> 00:48:53,130
Part of it is also where the natural resources are located. So like Texas and Oklahoma obviously have a lot more oil and natural gas than like.

404
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:59,880
New Hampshire, right, that that's potentially something that factors into it as well,

405
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:08,610
and not to like poo poo the Odell's and say that it has been effective at all, because if we look here like,

406
00:49:08,610 --> 00:49:17,520
yes, they are a small agency and essentially it boils down to one inspector per 60000 thousand workers covering nine million workplaces,

407
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:21,030
because, again, we primarily focus on the private industry.

408
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:30,750
So if you break it down, statistically, the odds of getting an inspection is once every 57 years.

409
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:42,480
But if you look between 1970 to 2004, the number of fatalities in the workplace has reduced significantly.

410
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:49,080
So it's like, OK, it's good that we do have this because think about could you think about what

411
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:54,300
like society would be today if OSHA didn't exist and we're in a global pandemic?

412
00:49:54,300 --> 00:50:04,320
Chaos, absolute chaos. So, yes, they have helped reduce exposures not only physical, but also chemical as well.

413
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:07,650
These are just four graphs to show you the trend line.

414
00:50:07,650 --> 00:50:17,950
These these ones here, the circles are coal miners and then the squares are metal and nonmetal miners.

415
00:50:17,950 --> 00:50:28,750
But have you talked about your other causes, how many chemicals are in like in consumer products?

416
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:32,380
Throw a number out there? Eighty thousand.

417
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:40,360
OK, yeah, that's that's about right. You know, it's only a week for you've already learned everything you needed to know.

418
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:53,380
I guess so, yeah. OSHA only has limits for about 500 of those chemicals and they haven't been updated since the 1970s.

419
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:56,920
Only about 30 of them have. Isn't that wild?

420
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:06,880
So despite all the research we've done, all the toxicological testing, all the longitudinal data, all the known chronic health effects of,

421
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:17,830
say, lead, for example, they're still using the scientific knowledge that they had in the 1970s to set these standards.

422
00:51:17,830 --> 00:51:25,870
So oftentimes how they set these standards are either about, look, it's a chemical.

423
00:51:25,870 --> 00:51:33,490
You're looking at that air concentration of it, and that can be either in milligrams per meter cubed or parts per million,

424
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:38,830
depending on the chemical itself, or it's a physical agent exposure.

425
00:51:38,830 --> 00:51:48,580
But when you're looking at an occupational exposure limit, when it comes from OSHA, it's called a permissible exposure limit or a.

426
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:54,400
So if someone throws at the word pal for you, it's from OSHA.

427
00:51:54,400 --> 00:52:01,240
And usually when you look at the P&L, they take that and they do what they call a time weighted average.

428
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:14,840
So on an average eight hour work day, assuming that you work eight hours a day, 40 hours a week for 50 of the 52 weeks out of the year.

429
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:20,020
So you only get two weeks off out of the year. They set up these eells, essentially.

430
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:33,040
So that says basically over an eight hour work day, you may only be exposed to an average of 90 decibels of noise, essentially.

431
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:42,490
Or tall, you mean, for example, which is a chemical found and various products and in nail salons and thinners in a workday,

432
00:52:42,490 --> 00:52:49,300
you can only be exposed to an average of 200 and parts two hundred parts per million of.

433
00:52:49,300 --> 00:53:02,620
So they did use studies and data. But again, this is only from the 70s and President Obama did try to push an act to update these pills.

434
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:12,160
But unfortunately, because of the bipartisan nature of everything that we tried to do these days, that was not successful at being passed.

435
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:21,100
So these spells are horribly, horribly outdated, like 50 years, half a century now.

436
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:26,650
And industrial experience and science and scientific data clearly indicate that

437
00:53:26,650 --> 00:53:31,840
a lot of these pills that were established in the 70s are now insufficient.

438
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:43,810
But they're the only ones that you can use to enforce a business and cite that you can't use anything else, which is so frustrating.

439
00:53:43,810 --> 00:53:51,370
So how do we regulate the environment versus how do we regulate to protect workers?

440
00:53:51,370 --> 00:53:57,910
So the EPA monitors basically everything outside of us.

441
00:53:57,910 --> 00:54:03,800
I did go to the trouble of obtaining these numbers, so it's not like they're super old.

442
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:11,740
So last year, the EPA had about 14000 employees and about a ten billion dollar budget.

443
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:20,560
And the max civil penalty you can get is thirty two thousand dollars per incident per day.

444
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:31,780
I decided, you know, I'm going to have a gender reveal party in a really dry part of Oregon and catch a lot of it on fire.

445
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:36,040
So which is just recently happens like every three months, I feel like.

446
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:41,410
Do people not learn? But you can get up to 15 years in jail.

447
00:54:41,410 --> 00:54:48,640
But the acceptable risk on health effects is usually one in ten to the negative six.

448
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:54,550
So like, really, really, really small, like really, really small.

449
00:54:54,550 --> 00:55:01,120
Whereas OSHA, for example, in comparison only has about twenty three hundred employees.

450
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:05,650
So those are like the inspectors and all the people who do all the administrative

451
00:55:05,650 --> 00:55:11,950
stuff and they only have a budget last year of five hundred and eighty million.

452
00:55:11,950 --> 00:55:16,920
The maximum penalty for this is seventy thousand dollars per.

453
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:27,360
But only six months in jail and the acceptable risk in health effects is I don't want to be one in 10 to the negative third.

454
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:34,770
So an example of this that I like to use is, you know, when we think of Canada,

455
00:55:34,770 --> 00:55:40,530
when we think of our upstairs neighbor, like we usually think they're on the cutting edge of things compared to us.

456
00:55:40,530 --> 00:55:40,710
Right.

457
00:55:40,710 --> 00:55:54,810
Like socialized medicine, you know, poutine, whatever, they actually have a poor occupational safety and health regulation standards than we do.

458
00:55:54,810 --> 00:56:04,050
And interestingly, one company in particular, you're probably too all too young to know what a front line PBS documentary is.

459
00:56:04,050 --> 00:56:12,280
But there was this Frontline PBS documentary about this steel pipe manufacturer,

460
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:19,960
a company called McWane, and they not only owned facilities in Canada, but here in the United States.

461
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:21,420
So in Tyler, Texas,

462
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:28,990
and a lot of areas in the south where essentially they make these like huge steel pipes that are used for irrigation and things like that.

463
00:56:28,990 --> 00:56:31,650
So it's like a really hazardous industry.

464
00:56:31,650 --> 00:56:39,840
But this company, McWane, was under investigation by OSHA because despite where the site was in the United States,

465
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:43,230
like people were dying left and right,

466
00:56:43,230 --> 00:56:50,490
like one worker rather than, you know, when you have issues on the line with machinery, you're supposed to stop production.

467
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:58,050
They don't do that. So one worker got his arm pad in there hot in there and his arm had to be amputated.

468
00:56:58,050 --> 00:57:08,370
Another worker had a back injury and he went to the onsite clinic, which was run by a physician that was kind of in cahoots with the company.

469
00:57:08,370 --> 00:57:13,920
And they told him that he just needed to, like, sleep off his back pain.

470
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:17,820
And then he went like several weeks without any care.

471
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:24,210
And they found out it was so severe that he had to get back surgery and metal plates put in his back.

472
00:57:24,210 --> 00:57:34,170
And he's now, like, permanently disabled. And another worker at one facility was working at night and didn't have anyone else

473
00:57:34,170 --> 00:57:39,070
spotting him when he fixed the machinery and they found him dead the next morning,

474
00:57:39,070 --> 00:57:50,280
caught in it. But a lot of these worker regulations or violations can be argued down from a felony to a misdemeanor.

475
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:55,740
And the company argued that they are the main economic life in this town.

476
00:57:55,740 --> 00:57:59,790
So if you shut us down, you're ruining the economy.

477
00:57:59,790 --> 00:58:10,350
So even though this worker died, they were they were able to argue they're fine, down to eight thousand dollars and no jail time.

478
00:58:10,350 --> 00:58:17,520
So it's really, like, depressing when you think about it for is like what is a human life worth worth?

479
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:27,550
Because in the workplace, sometimes it's worth a lot less than if I, like, went to Montana and killed a buffalo.

480
00:58:27,550 --> 00:58:36,540
So, yeah. So we have a couple of types of Oglalas, but you don't have to concern yourself with too much extensively.

481
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:40,110
No detail about this, but the daily limit, which I mentioned earlier,

482
00:58:40,110 --> 00:58:47,700
is a twenty eight hour shift, 40 hour work week, 50 week work year, 40 year career.

483
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:55,170
A short term limit is usually considered a time weighted average over a 15 minute period.

484
00:58:55,170 --> 00:58:59,160
This is designed to protect you against health effects that occur really quickly.

485
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:04,650
So you're working in a spray booth, for example, and have like a giant burst of a particular chemical.

486
00:59:04,650 --> 00:59:09,360
If we sample in that 15 minute period, you can't exceed it.

487
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:19,170
Ceiling limit is something that should never be exceeded. So these are potentially things like hydrogen sulfide, for example, or carbon monoxide.

488
00:59:19,170 --> 00:59:27,150
And then there are emergency chemical limits as well. So usually where's the rubber?

489
00:59:27,150 --> 00:59:38,760
OK, it's not there. But usually if we took an air sample, for example, of somebody just say, what is this 200 mg committed to?

490
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:44,250
OK, just say this is like particulate dust that a worker is allowed to be able to exposed to.

491
00:59:44,250 --> 00:59:49,020
So from our zero to our eight, the graph might look like this.

492
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:57,450
The eight hour time weighted average is about like a little less than 50 milligrams per meters.

493
00:59:57,450 --> 01:00:05,550
Cute. And the short term limit in 15 minutes, you can't exceed more than one hundred and twenty five.

494
01:00:05,550 --> 01:00:12,110
And at no point in the day can you exceed more than one hundred and seventy five.

495
01:00:12,110 --> 01:00:23,760
Does that make sense? So, you know, there's a couple ways to quantify occupational exposure limits, right?

496
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:29,190
We have our traditional Odell's which kind of fall at the top of the pyramid there.

497
01:00:29,190 --> 01:00:33,120
And then we have working provisional L's. Right.

498
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:39,870
That might be based on what a trade association recommends, like a carpenters union, for example.

499
01:00:39,870 --> 01:00:48,690
And then we start to get into things which a lot of people don't like to do because it's not as clear cut is something called hazard banding.

500
01:00:48,690 --> 01:00:55,830
So hazard banding is being used more commonly today, or it's also called control banding.

501
01:00:55,830 --> 01:01:03,090
And it's mostly used previously in pharmaceutical companies because they're working with a

502
01:01:03,090 --> 01:01:09,180
number of different chemicals that might be working synergistically or antagonistically,

503
01:01:09,180 --> 01:01:18,210
we don't know. So we're taking the information known about like these groups or classes of exposures and then kind of trying to determine,

504
01:01:18,210 --> 01:01:22,650
like, how they interact with each other and then how people control this one.

505
01:01:22,650 --> 01:01:28,620
That control banding has been used for actually quite frequently is actually covid-19 we

506
01:01:28,620 --> 01:01:35,970
consider biological hazards like the most insidious hazard because unlike other hazards,

507
01:01:35,970 --> 01:01:42,270
I can't see it with my naked eye. I can't smell it or detected it in any way.

508
01:01:42,270 --> 01:01:50,730
But I also don't have the technology like an immediate direct reading instrument where I could know, oh, OK.

509
01:01:50,730 --> 01:01:58,980
Right now, the level of carbon dioxide in this room is this much like there's no way for us to quantify a virus or a bacteria.

510
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:03,240
That's what makes it really complicated to try to control covid.

511
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:13,350
So based on what we know about the virus and based on what we know about the hierarchy of controls and how we can stack essentially protections,

512
01:02:13,350 --> 01:02:20,810
we do control banding to try to mitigate or manage the risk to the work of.

513
01:02:20,810 --> 01:02:31,520
Oh, and the formula's at the bottom like hazard bans, risk assessment, plus exposure management, so there's differences in acceptable risk.

514
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:44,060
So, you know, like I said, people people are have a much higher tolerance for what workers can be exposed to than the environment.

515
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:55,520
But also when companies aren't necessarily part fall under OSHA regulations, there's a higher tolerance for what's acceptable as well.

516
01:02:55,520 --> 01:03:06,180
So I had the opportunity to visit this manufacturing facility in the middle of nowhere, Indiana, but they make t stands for basketball.

517
01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:15,800
So like, if you want the hoop and the backing to go up, it's like that metal thing that makes it do that or like padding on gymnasium walls.

518
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:20,900
So when you run into a wall, you don't hurt yourself or like wrestling mats.

519
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:31,730
So they mostly did those and they didn't necessarily fall under any like strict OSHA regulations, but they were part of what they call a VP,

520
01:03:31,730 --> 01:03:40,850
which is a voluntary protection program, because this worksite in particular already had a number of fatalities.

521
01:03:40,850 --> 01:03:44,810
But obviously, like OSHA is not coming in and saying you need to fix this, this and that.

522
01:03:44,810 --> 01:03:53,210
So at least the company made this commitment by going into the BPP to try to better the situation for workers.

523
01:03:53,210 --> 01:04:01,640
But just walking through, like some of the things you saw there, definitely had a higher level of acceptable risk.

524
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:06,350
So workers who were stapling the material to the padding,

525
01:04:06,350 --> 01:04:12,590
they had visible like bandaids all over their hands because they clearly were like

526
01:04:12,590 --> 01:04:18,680
stapling themselves because they weren't wearing proof gloves or no regulations on PPE.

527
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:24,740
People in the spray booth weren't wearing sufficient respiratory protection.

528
01:04:24,740 --> 01:04:30,470
People doing welding and welding weren't wearing appropriate masks to shield your eyes.

529
01:04:30,470 --> 01:04:38,630
You don't like flying yourself over time. So it's very different, depending if it's voluntary or involuntary.

530
01:04:38,630 --> 01:04:43,400
And then, like, how unpleasant are the outcomes?

531
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:54,260
Obviously, you don't want to go to work and just like see like a metal rods sticking out of your coworkers head.

532
01:04:54,260 --> 01:05:03,500
So that's very unpleasant outcomes. But like, you know, precleared, like my coworker has a cough, like, you know, those are kind of easier to ignore.

533
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:05,720
And there's also cultural differences as well.

534
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:12,860
So even even going throughout the United States state to state where when you go to like there's you can

535
01:05:12,860 --> 01:05:19,490
tell there's a visible difference in the level of importance placed on occupational safety and health.

536
01:05:19,490 --> 01:05:30,770
So they're Bourdin is that, you know, they have to protect all employees essentially from known hazards and be have the old limits.

537
01:05:30,770 --> 01:05:36,320
And if we proposed new limits, of course, that will significantly reduce those risks.

538
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:41,840
And if we do new limits because we've had new technology in the last 50 years,

539
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:49,100
more economic data about the negative implications about some of these things, it might be feasible.

540
01:05:49,100 --> 01:05:55,820
But again, the result is that when you try to change a standard, like a lot of things,

541
01:05:55,820 --> 01:06:02,180
it's just so complex and time consuming in order to get it legally enforceable.

542
01:06:02,180 --> 01:06:16,760
So just say, for example, for ammonia, I decide to change the P&L from a thousand parts per million to five hundred parts per million.

543
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:25,880
So usually OSHA has their P&L and then Nawash comes along and they have their own thing called recommended exposure limits or RELS.

544
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:30,950
But Nawash updates there's every one to two years based on the research they're doing.

545
01:06:30,950 --> 01:06:41,810
So if you look at most Odell's, you'll notice that Nyasha is usually like half of what Oceanus is because they're willing to tolerate a lot less.

546
01:06:41,810 --> 01:06:44,840
But who's actually going around and actually enforcing that?

547
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:51,920
Like, you can go to every work site that uses ammonia and then set up time weighted average monitoring,

548
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:57,890
you know, for an eight hour a day and be like you're still at seven hundred and fifty.

549
01:06:57,890 --> 01:07:08,120
We need to get you down to like five hundred. So in theory, in practicality, we would love to set new limits.

550
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:19,850
But in enforcing it actually and rolling it out, that would require, frankly, a lot more money and a lot more of the workforce to be able to handle.

551
01:07:19,850 --> 01:07:32,910
So Jake Jayco, so that the joint commission is only focused on hospital accreditation, so Jayco,

552
01:07:32,910 --> 01:07:40,340
make sure that the hospitals are up to standards in terms of like the stability, staffing procedures,

553
01:07:40,340 --> 01:07:45,290
all that jazz in order for a hospital to essentially say like, yes,

554
01:07:45,290 --> 01:07:55,610
we are a functioning accredited hospital and we can we are still designated a level one trauma center or like a level two trauma center.

555
01:07:55,610 --> 01:08:03,800
And OSHA does come in there as well. But they don't do anything with the hospital accreditation like the hospital existing.

556
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:07,650
They're only concerned with the workers who are in there.

557
01:08:07,650 --> 01:08:14,840
Yeah, great question. Yeah. And then, like nursing homes and long term care have their own accrediting facilities as well.

558
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:26,880
And then schools of public health. Yes, I there's a lot of.

559
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:33,840
How does that happen for the first? And that's a great question.

560
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:37,860
It depends. That's that's the answer to everything.

561
01:08:37,860 --> 01:08:42,030
It depends like, for example, this OSHA standard that I was talking about,

562
01:08:42,030 --> 01:08:48,120
that they wanted to push for ergonomics that would require ergonomic assessment in

563
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:52,210
more or less like every workplace that had high musculoskeletal disorder risk.

564
01:08:52,210 --> 01:08:58,980
A lot of employers don't know how to do ergonomic assessment. And then when we come to occupational safety and health professionals, I mean,

565
01:08:58,980 --> 01:09:06,570
most of us are trained in basic ergonomics, but not a lot of people who are specialized for guardedness.

566
01:09:06,570 --> 01:09:12,390
Right. So even though we have technology, we know it saves money.

567
01:09:12,390 --> 01:09:18,970
The practicality of like going in there to actually get it set up is a whole other thing.

568
01:09:18,970 --> 01:09:24,400
Sorry, that's unsatisfying. So, you know, this is just, again,

569
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:30,310
showing how they set up the panel based on it's like a visual representation of what we had earlier

570
01:09:30,310 --> 01:09:36,280
and they used data from AP and toxicology to essentially create this exposure response curve,

571
01:09:36,280 --> 01:09:43,690
knowing, you know, at what point do we have significant risk or deleterious health effects?

572
01:09:43,690 --> 01:09:49,540
So a lot of us who work in the field, we know that Pells are great.

573
01:09:49,540 --> 01:09:58,450
So, Nilesh, like I said, they have their own called recommended exposure limits or rels rules are only really acknowledged here in the United States.

574
01:09:58,450 --> 01:10:06,250
And like I said, they're not legally enforceable. So if a workplace, for example, is like, you know, most if you think about it,

575
01:10:06,250 --> 01:10:17,290
most workplaces honest and a grading scale of A to F everybody is just trying to hit a C, everybody just wants to do the average to just get by.

576
01:10:17,290 --> 01:10:24,040
But you do have some companies that do like generally care a little bit more about the health and safety of their workers.

577
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:31,120
One, for example, that's really great is L.L. Bean, the one that makes like outdoors apparel and shoes.

578
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:36,370
So they might say, I want to shoot for that. A, I don't want to just be a C company.

579
01:10:36,370 --> 01:10:42,490
Then if they come in with their occupational safety and health person that's either in-house or a consultant,

580
01:10:42,490 --> 01:10:47,950
they say, OK, I don't want to just meet the Pells. I want to go for what the rules are.

581
01:10:47,950 --> 01:10:56,980
So how can we change some of our work practices or processes to lower the exposure to the workers?

582
01:10:56,980 --> 01:11:06,100
Another one that industrial hygienist mainly used is from the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist, or AC Gage.

583
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:15,310
And we have what we call a threshold limit values or these till these existed two years before OSHA even existed.

584
01:11:15,310 --> 01:11:19,810
So OSHA modeled a lot of their Pells based on the Telvin.

585
01:11:19,810 --> 01:11:25,420
So but themselves also update more or less every year or two.

586
01:11:25,420 --> 01:11:34,810
And they also take into account biological exposure indexes or be eyes for biomarkers like they collect data from

587
01:11:34,810 --> 01:11:44,080
workers on things like blood and urine and hair to determine what their potential chronic exposures might be.

588
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:53,590
And they make recommendations that way. So these are distinctive because the nice thing, if you ever decide to get a CIA,

589
01:11:53,590 --> 01:12:01,240
which is a certified industrial hygienist, it's not only recognized here in the United States, but it's worldwide a.l.

590
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:05,980
These are derived. They don't care what the regulations are in the US.

591
01:12:05,980 --> 01:12:14,690
They don't care what the regulations are in Japan. They're giving themselves based on what they know from existing data that we have.

592
01:12:14,690 --> 01:12:21,130
They also don't take into account the like the feasibility or socioeconomic socioeconomic considerations.

593
01:12:21,130 --> 01:12:25,840
So it's strictly scientific. So it's like, you know, this is what we want.

594
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:29,800
How difficult is it to implement? Like, that's your problem.

595
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:34,420
But this is just like what we're saying, what it is. So in their application,

596
01:12:34,420 --> 01:12:43,390
it's mostly very much specialized people who work in the field that are sufficiently trained in order to

597
01:12:43,390 --> 01:12:52,620
make the necessary judgments of do I want to try to aim for the TV or am I just kind of like going for the.

598
01:12:52,620 --> 01:13:03,330
OK, I got a little ahead of myself, but I'm also trying to be mindful of the time basically just said that,

599
01:13:03,330 --> 01:13:14,970
OK, so if you see the variability here, the first column is HGH and then the last column is OSHA.

600
01:13:14,970 --> 01:13:20,820
And if you look at the recommended exposure limits, like, for example, DI Chloro Fluoro Methane,

601
01:13:20,820 --> 01:13:26,130
ACG is saying that a worker can't be exposed to more than 10 parts per million and an eight

602
01:13:26,130 --> 01:13:34,200
hour workday and also says you can be exposed to up to a thousand or for something like,

603
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:38,700
let's see what else to hexogen.

604
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:45,630
You can only be exposed to five parts per million, according to the TV. But according to OSHA, you can be exposed to up to 100.

605
01:13:45,630 --> 01:13:52,860
So you can see the drastic difference there. And that in terms of trends for E-L.

606
01:13:52,860 --> 01:14:03,900
So the diamond is that'll be the square is Sweden and the triangles are the European Union.

607
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:14,670
So generally in terms of like worker safety and health, like the Western Europeans and the Scandinavians are pretty on the ball with that.

608
01:14:14,670 --> 01:14:26,550
So they try to stay on par with each other. But some of these countries now have moved way ahead of us in terms of where they are with their OIOS.

609
01:14:26,550 --> 01:14:32,670
And you think they should be consistent with tax data on carcinogenicity?

610
01:14:32,670 --> 01:14:46,410
No, it's not. So for things that we know are are cancer causing, it is one factor in determining the Oyl, but not the sole factor.

611
01:14:46,410 --> 01:14:56,490
So the car Cicconetti classification there one is like we know it causes cancer in humans too, is it probably causes cancer in humans.

612
01:14:56,490 --> 01:14:59,340
Three is it definitely causes cancer in animals.

613
01:14:59,340 --> 01:15:08,280
But we don't have enough data to figure out if it is causing cancer in humans and then like four and five or like inconclusive.

614
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:17,010
So you see the Swedish Work Environment Authority has come down pretty hard on applying their wheels to this carcinogen data.

615
01:15:17,010 --> 01:15:27,770
But for the European Commission and even HGH, they don't they still aren't necessarily quite there yet.

616
01:15:27,770 --> 01:15:34,880
Oh, we were going to do this habitat allocation exercise, but like again, I always this thing was like, I always talk too much.

617
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:38,150
So, OK, we'll just get to them and then get some questions.

618
01:15:38,150 --> 01:15:43,800
So we do have some international organizations who also care about worker safety and health.

619
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:50,900
So the w h o again, they don't really have any regulatory power, but they do a lot of guidelines.

620
01:15:50,900 --> 01:15:58,160
The International Labor Organization as well puts out standards on there.

621
01:15:58,160 --> 01:16:08,480
We try to keep in mind special working populations like women, children, the elderly, and then those who are socioeconomically disadvantaged.

622
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:14,720
But again, theory versus actual just are always two very different things.

623
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:23,540
And then there's like a number of resources, like after this lecture, if I've inspired you to get curious about, you know,

624
01:16:23,540 --> 01:16:30,950
OIOS and all that kind of stuff, there is data where you can find like work-Related Lung Disease Surveillance Systems.

625
01:16:30,950 --> 01:16:34,260
The Bureau of Labor Statistics is always interesting to poke around.

626
01:16:34,260 --> 01:16:39,030
And because they're a federal agency, they have to publish like almost all of their data.

627
01:16:39,030 --> 01:16:43,490
So they have plenty of CEV and Excel files.

628
01:16:43,490 --> 01:16:54,440
If you're thinking about like a master's thesis and wanting to do a secondary data analysis, we have onat for hazard information for jobs.

629
01:16:54,440 --> 01:17:03,980
This is chemical limits. This is a guy gets his database on hazardous substances.

630
01:17:03,980 --> 01:17:09,710
The EPA also has one as well. And that's it.

631
01:17:09,710 --> 01:17:15,680
OK, so that was like sixty three slides. So we have like two, one minute left.

632
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:22,470
Any, any last questions or comments or thoughts.

633
01:17:22,470 --> 01:17:30,470
Yes, I you said that. Deregulation's.

634
01:17:30,470 --> 01:17:36,140
Oh, no. So so OSHA, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration,

635
01:17:36,140 --> 01:17:45,650
was established because a lot of people were protesting the Vietnam War and more like the what is the government actually doing for us?

636
01:17:45,650 --> 01:17:50,990
So because that kind of mentality became more popular, they were like, oh, what is the work?

637
01:17:50,990 --> 01:17:55,340
What does the government actually doing for us to help protect us in the workplace?

638
01:17:55,340 --> 01:18:04,790
And then that's how they decided to form OSHA, because they put a lot of pressure on, like the Nixon administration to do that.

639
01:18:04,790 --> 01:18:08,180
That's a great question about Agent Orange.

640
01:18:08,180 --> 01:18:15,560
I don't to my knowledge, I think there was any connection with these occupational exposure limits in Agent Orange.

641
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:26,030
And part of that was because at that time, they didn't know how dangerous that was to human health and how much it would deform people.

642
01:18:26,030 --> 01:18:35,410
So it's a great question. Yes, so. Facilities like the Jayco for accreditation, is there anything for that like?

643
01:18:35,410 --> 01:18:41,670
Industry research suggests it depends on what industry that you look at.

644
01:18:41,670 --> 01:18:48,450
So for like nursing homes, I mentioned, they have their own accrediting boards, a lot of schools, public schools,

645
01:18:48,450 --> 01:18:54,660
but also universities have their own accrediting board where there's certain standards that have to be kept up.

646
01:18:54,660 --> 01:19:02,730
And then like engineering as well, they have their own accrediting boards or how specific like buildings should be structured.

647
01:19:02,730 --> 01:19:09,420
But again, all that has to do with itself is like what is in this building?

648
01:19:09,420 --> 01:19:16,290
Does it have X, Y and Z? And if not, like, that's what the accreditation is for.

649
01:19:16,290 --> 01:19:21,540
But when it comes to, like, the bodies in that work place and are they protected,

650
01:19:21,540 --> 01:19:30,570
that's when OSHA steps in and I see students clamoring outside and they're like raring to like, get in.

651
01:19:30,570 --> 01:19:37,170
So thank you so much. Thanks a lot and Tim for inviting me here.

652
01:19:37,170 --> 01:19:43,925
Thank you so much, Professor Lee.
