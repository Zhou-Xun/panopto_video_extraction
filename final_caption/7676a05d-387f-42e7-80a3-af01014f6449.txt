1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,290
Okay. Let's get started. So last time we introduced the definition of variable.

2
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:21,320
Continue. Toward the end of last lecture, we also introduced a definition for cumulative distribution of function of historic.

3
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:29,530
I'm sorry. I see the out argument that was distributed and the process actually characterized everything we need to know about it right now.

4
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:37,710
So it tells us all about the distribution, about all the properties of a right, about how the probability is defined.

5
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:47,120
You cannot run a variable. So let's start today with another example, just to winterize ourselves with that.

6
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:52,530
Figure out how sirup is derived and how it's related to probability.

7
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:56,550
So this is an example from the sell out Burgers book.

8
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:05,190
The set up is as follows We cost a coin multiple times until we have a had.

9
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:16,020
Okay, so that's the set. And we did note the random variable asked to be the number of houses.

10
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:31,220
This random variable args is denoted to be the number of causes from pal we have a have.

11
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:37,870
So that's how we define this run a variable. Recall that right about this assignment means a function.

12
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:43,570
Right. It maps the original event to a to the real space in this case.

13
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:49,059
Well, the event that we care about, the number of causes, is essentially in the real space.

14
00:01:49,060 --> 00:02:00,340
So this run of our by self HSA identity mapping or a diameter identity function and mapping representing the number of causes.

15
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:03,820
Tell me how I define the roundabout in this way.

16
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:08,920
First of all, what is the sample space? What is the possible value of this is running variable?

17
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:21,120
Any thoughts? If we define as to be the number of forces we have ahead, then what?

18
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:24,720
What are the values that this renovation will contain?

19
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:32,160
Yeah. Yes. And non-negative integers are good non-active integers.

20
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,240
All right. We can toss that one time and got to have directly.

21
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:40,650
Or I can toss it two times for a tail that had and so on, so forth.

22
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:50,160
So theoretically speaking, you can toss it infinite times and you going to fail conceptually.

23
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:57,300
That's a possibility. Also, if you practice this, almost the probability is going to be extremely small.

24
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:08,790
But I think this act is would take value from 1 to 3 all the way to the infinite end.

25
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:16,360
And the way that we define it, we cannot take that as zero, because we cannot I call it zero times.

26
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:19,950
I've got to have this. Not impossible.

27
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:30,600
Okay. So this is the sample space for this random run available in order to calculate the PDR.

28
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:36,360
First, we need to know the probability for this running variable.

29
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:44,130
Taking each value says it only has countable, infinite amount of values that we can calculate the probability.

30
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:55,840
Of this random variable taking any particular value or this tax is a value in this positive manager asset equity.

31
00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:02,280
The small acts to be a number in this positive positive integer.

32
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:07,980
What is the probability of this random variable x taking value and small?

33
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:21,090
How do we calculate this probability as the right amount of x?

34
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:26,880
Taking a value by small x that is a positive integer.

35
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:35,540
How the example in the probability. I don't want to guess.

36
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:44,610
I'll have to say that I have to the power of x y to the power of x.

37
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,680
And could you explain why this is?

38
00:04:50,820 --> 00:05:03,870
Because we need to ensure that the first x minus one doesn't just tell and the ax and x also have so its own probabilities.

39
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:11,820
What happened to the politics? Very good. So we essentially divide it into a sequential procedure.

40
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,870
Right. So first, we need to it X minus one times.

41
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:25,410
And each time we need to make sure it's a table. Otherwise, it doesn't it doesn't satisfy this event at this time as a cause of the talks.

42
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:35,850
And for that, that's minus one. That tells us if we need it to be all tails, then the probability is going to be a one half to the power as minus one.

43
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:44,180
Right. And the last, last cause, we need it to be a hat that also has a property on top.

44
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,760
So if you multiply everything together, it's going to be a one over two.

45
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,110
The moral or more generally. If I assume.

46
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:13,480
Because the probability of of of carrying a hat is P and the probability of got out teo is one minus field.

47
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,380
And then these can be.

48
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:27,100
Polar Express as one minus P to the power of x minus one times p.

49
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:38,830
If this is not a fair coin, this summit has a higher probability of going to have lower power for that kind of tail or whatever.

50
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:42,260
You can always express the probability in use in this photograph.

51
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:51,050
At the same logic that we just said, and these hold for any ax in this integer.

52
00:06:51,180 --> 00:07:03,580
So right now we have the probability of our individual event or individual outcome, and now we can follow the definition to derive a CDF.

53
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:10,600
And for this run of our blocks, in particular this city of.

54
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,490
So you probably have some notations like this.

55
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:27,359
When we use this capital app to represent the CDP City, our function and use a capital X to put it in the subscript two,

56
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,900
indicating that this is a CDP for this run of our blocks.

57
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:40,440
And the smart is the the arguments are the values that are we want to evaluate this city our function that

58
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:47,950
and so this by definition is the probability of this random variable last are equal to this small ax.

59
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:53,640
And since we already know about each small acts taking this value,

60
00:07:53,820 --> 00:08:00,600
what is probability is that this is just going to be the summation I go from one to.

61
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,960
That's the the largest integer that is.

62
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:16,210
Last article two of a small x. So they asked the court to object.

63
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:24,340
And that is. I got someone to ask me.

64
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,920
I might want to. But.

65
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:37,680
And they are for any acts or any acts in the real space.

66
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:44,400
We why I'm using this notation, we can't fight any acts in the real space.

67
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:52,310
So now you are to write out the explicit formula for the city of.

68
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:56,950
We just need to simplify these summations.

69
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:33,280
And we need to use the. And we need to use this relation, this formula that tells us how this summation of this power turns.

70
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:39,850
What is the explicit process for the summation of the power terms?

71
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:59,140
And so I'll give you 2 minutes to use this equation to simplify this function and see whether you can get the final results by applying this equation.

72
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:19,550
She? Hey, you got it.

73
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:27,380
So what is the final solution? The final answer to this question.

74
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:34,740
What is the expression of this city function? Yes.

75
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:42,200
He times. Uh, one minus the quantity.

76
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:50,160
One minus p to the lower to the power of like the lower back that.

77
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:58,910
Yes. There should be one minus, one minus, one minus.

78
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:03,860
Yeah, he should be on the outside and it's a one minus that one.

79
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:16,990
It's Yeah. And over, over t oh wait a minute now and then you multiply by Pete's and I'm still have a time.

80
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,120
Pete so. That's right. So are you good?

81
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,160
This actually is the final result. All right?

82
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:35,290
This is what you get up to simplify this summation by applying this summation to this formula

83
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:46,370
and you got this final CTF expression and this is for any act of almost it should be for any I.

84
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:50,200
I've got a zero you can always apply this faster.

85
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:55,220
And for any acts less than zero, it's always equal to zero.

86
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:10,970
And you say since we have this this special location indicating that's the largest integer that is below the act's value.

87
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:21,450
So this is actually a stop function. Think you draw this function states in numbers.

88
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:02,280
The draw the function. Actually, you can see it only jobs at this integer point.

89
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:08,100
Okay. And that's not a zero as we can see here.

90
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:23,730
They see the function always starts zero and the first job comes out at one right continuous point to be a solid point of favor.

91
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:30,870
And the value point actually for one, the city, our function is one minus, one minus P.

92
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:35,110
So that's going to be okay.

93
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:44,130
This height is key and then it stay there until you reach the next integer, which is two.

94
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:49,770
So it has another job. And what is the height of this job?

95
00:14:55,090 --> 00:15:08,840
What is the height of the second? How do we calculate this drop?

96
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:21,840
Yes. Increases by one fourth. I want what we use this p to represent the probability of.

97
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:39,110
So. Where was that speech where he squares one liners that say the way the calculated as far as you can calculate what is able

98
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:53,640
to is right and from this formula we know of two as one minus one minus p square and minus this height which is p right.

99
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:58,470
Which is one which is one minus one minus p e quantity.

100
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:08,940
So the difference between these two are going to be the height of the job, which is going to be one minus one, minus three squared minus two.

101
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:17,200
Right. So if you calculate it, it's going to be what P bias is.

102
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:22,820
What? All right. Right.

103
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:28,730
Right. That's the height of this company, minus p-square.

104
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:35,420
So there's not going to be two P minus P-SQUARE.

105
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:50,290
And similarly, you can calculate the jump for the third when when acts equal to three.

106
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:58,590
Right. You can also calculate the jump in a similar way and the next jump happens at actually point of four and so on.

107
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:06,260
So of course. So each time the jump, the height of the jump, it's going to be different.

108
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:15,680
And you can always calculate the jump by taking the difference between two adjacent between the city of valley,

109
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:24,860
evaluated at two adjacent time X mountains and these city I found.

110
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:30,530
So I'm going to be a step function and it's always going to go up as when I'm going to be for city of function.

111
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:36,319
It's always non de crazy and it cannot go to infinity in the end.

112
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:42,650
As you can say, the jump is just getting smaller and smaller and they do not have equal height.

113
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:49,520
So in the end they won't go to infinity, but rather reaching a limiting.

114
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:59,440
Malibu, which is one mile away.

115
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:05,630
This function, this stepwise function. Well, which one?

116
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:15,589
If I approach infinity, this is what the city our function for this run of our stop points function right.

117
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:20,030
Continuous non decreasing but approaching one.

118
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:31,970
Any question. Yes.

119
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,020
You do efforts to find one at this point.

120
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:45,170
Yeah. So if we want to complete the task at this point.

121
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:58,720
Practically what the jump is in the height of this thud and the height of the difference between the height of this dot and the height of this circle.

122
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:08,590
Height and the height of this thought is essentially the city of value evaluated at two and the height of this circle.

123
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:11,740
Recall that this is a step function, so remain constant.

124
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:17,350
So the height on this search is always equal to the height of the of the dot in front of it.

125
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:26,110
So that's why you can take you can grab this value by evaluating this in our function and actually part one.

126
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:31,330
And now you got the difference between the two and conceptually what that means.

127
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:37,630
The height of this jump is essentially the probability of this random variable taking value equal to two.

128
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:45,820
In other words, this quantity is the probability of X equal to two.

129
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:55,350
So that is a jump at this x equals two to position.

130
00:19:55,820 --> 00:20:01,149
Okay. Yes. So the jump the difference is probably x equals two.

131
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:06,400
But then the effort two is the probability of x equals two and anything below that.

132
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:14,979
Right. Exactly. So this the height of this thought is at X actually quite accurate,

133
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:24,850
which means the probability of the amount of parallel amounts that the relation between the probability and the CDF.

134
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:37,330
Yes, I'm not sure. But I'm wondering, should the power of one minus p the ceiling of four because so it's an active term is the

135
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:46,330
possibility that is the sum of the probability that ax is larger than the given small x.

136
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:57,820
So what's my question? I'm wondering if the power of one minus distribution function see the ceiling of X instead of the floor.

137
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:04,450
So it depends on which which acts value you are talking about.

138
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:07,930
For example, a power of this actually Quanta two, right?

139
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:17,650
So the Apple two is here because I recall that Apple two is defined as the probability of at last article two two, right?

140
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:21,430
The quantity is in this evaluation.

141
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:29,290
So it has to be a solid point. It has to step up and is actually equal to two.

142
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:35,880
So that's why you always have this ry continuous function of.

143
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:40,270
I see. That's also a question.

144
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,440
For example, if X equals 2.5. Huh.

145
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:57,180
So the distribution function should be one minus the probability of x larger than our.

146
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:00,780
No question. So if acts equal to 2.5.

147
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:08,370
What is this out of 2.5? Well, you can always refer to the formula that we just got, right.

148
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:16,230
So first of all, we need to know what is the largest integer that is the last the last or equal to 2.5?

149
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:25,860
That's two. Right. So that tells us this idea is one minus one minus P to the power to.

150
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:41,700
And now the question. All right. Another example, we want to show that the continuous setting up a continuous function.

151
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:48,840
Actually, it is a CTA if it satisfies all of the properties that we have talked about before.

152
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:58,170
So assume that these are aspects function as the expression of one over one plus B to the active x.

153
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:08,470
20 acts in the real space. The question is, we want to show that this app itself is a city function.

154
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:16,030
So the show that this app itself acts is a city function. We need to refer to the theorem that we talked about last time.

155
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:26,050
We specifically say that if a function satisfied property to 3.5, then we can argue it's a city function.

156
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:29,920
The proof was automated, but the conclusion always holds.

157
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:39,070
We are to show that this app for ourselves as being a city, our function, we just need clarify those four conditions.

158
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:47,800
So the first condition that we need to verify is that if we take the limit, x goes to negative infinity.

159
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:57,790
This app acts up. X needs to be zero. And, and the second condition is x goes to positive infinity.

160
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:02,770
This app has to be one third.

161
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:11,720
If now increasing.

162
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:17,550
And finally, it has to be right.

163
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:30,430
And it's. As long as these four conditions are satisfied, we can we can conclude this acts of acts is a serious function.

164
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:35,380
And so let's take a look at each of these conditions first.

165
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:42,549
If you take the limit of acts both to enacting the affinity of what you have call in this case,

166
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:52,530
as we have this place in expression for this function, that is a pretty straightforward calculation, right?

167
00:24:52,550 --> 00:25:03,730
If you take acts as an active affinity, one over one plus E to the next, as we know, that is not it's going to be a conversion to infinity.

168
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:11,440
And if you take the exponential, it also goes to infinity and denominator goes to infinity, then this matter goes to zero.

169
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:17,709
So that apparently go at similarly the cycle one that acts as an infinity.

170
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:25,020
By the same argument, we can conclude that these acts of acts will converge to one right?

171
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:29,260
And for now the phrasing on the right continuous.

172
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:35,590
We observe that this function defined in this way is essentially a continuous function.

173
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:38,830
We can take the derivative of this function. All right.

174
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:48,880
If I take the derivative of this fact, self acts with respect to acts, by the way, now we start to use calculus.

175
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:54,790
So I'll give you 30 seconds. Write down this derivative.

176
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:36,930
I hope you all get this. So the final answer should be one.

177
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:42,420
The denominator is one plus each of the active acts square and the numerator is

178
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:46,379
E to the negative x actually got to negative sign something that cancels out.

179
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:54,540
So that's going to be equal to negative attacks over one plus E to the negative X squared.

180
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:57,840
And so that's the derivative of this function.

181
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:08,910
And what do we know if the derivative is positive from calculus, we know that the derivative of function is positive.

182
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:16,500
It has to be an increasing function. So the third and fourth are both correct.

183
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:24,030
With those four conditions satisfied, we know this city, our function, this function F X is essentially a city.

184
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:34,530
And by using the theorem that was introduced last time, in fact, this acts of acts is not just any arbitrary city,

185
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:43,080
our function, it actually has a name and it corresponds to the logistic distribution and which we'll learn more about later.

186
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:50,640
Is this a city, a function for the just distribution?

187
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:56,930
In other words, if I if I run a marathon and follow them,

188
00:27:56,930 --> 00:28:12,790
let's just take a distribution the city out of the run of I'll always have this tournament that is sort of related to the logistical question how.

189
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:23,580
But the last example that I want to show is to see out with time.

190
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:29,940
So now the city, our function doesn't have to be a continuous function or a stepwise function.

191
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:44,040
It can be a combination of both. For example, we can consider a function of X taking the expression of one minus epsilon,

192
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:59,940
one plus E two that's less than zero and perhaps one plus one -14, because as far as we know, a zero.

193
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:09,090
We can define a function this way. All right. For any for any absolute zero.

194
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:18,510
And that's not what this is. Cause that we fix a constant epsilon that is between zero and one and define this function in this way.

195
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:22,710
If you actually draw this function, this affects functions.

196
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:37,030
It is. You can see that it's below zero and we are increasing function all the way up to what?

197
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:49,030
What is the value of that image at zero? But what is this value?

198
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:55,330
This is your app function. Right.

199
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:01,930
And so that's how I got a zero. When it's approaching zero from the left hand side.

200
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:10,170
What is the value of the last point? Five assassination.

201
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:21,950
What's the matter here? This is calculus.

202
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:29,240
Yes. Well, you've said. Are you good?

203
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:38,870
Y minus epsilon over two. And why is that? Well, that's taking the limit of this part.

204
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:46,160
Of this part. And let the construct a sequence that approach zero from the left hand side.

205
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,810
And as you approach in zero sense, it's a continuous function.

206
00:30:53,700 --> 00:31:01,589
You can actually take zero to calculate the hour limit. If you take an x equals zero, then you got two in the denominator at a y minus.

207
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:06,120
Have something in the numerator. So that gave us the value of y minus x over two.

208
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:12,810
And similarly, you can draw the the function on the right hand side of this axis.

209
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:20,460
So start somewhere here and it go all the way up until it reached the limit.

210
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:24,720
Should be why the y is the value here.

211
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:37,180
Yeah. All right. You take the limit. That acts across there from the right hand side.

212
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:45,280
And that gave us epsilon plus one minus epsilon over two, which is one.

213
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:54,210
Plus Epsilon over two months. So this is what the city functions look like.

214
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:58,890
Apparently it's not a continuous function, but it all has one jump points.

215
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:06,180
That is, that x equals zero. Now, the question is, is this X function still a city of.

216
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,320
Is the question clear how the function is defined.

217
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:21,750
And the question is, is it a city, a well-defined city, a function or some roundabout?

218
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:28,750
To answer that question, we need to go back to that theorem to verify those four conditions.

219
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:39,010
First, if you take the limit. So again, I think the limit go to negative infinity.

220
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:45,490
So that should be zero, sir. Now, keep pressing.

221
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:59,530
And I remind you that for the first one, the second one is going to be exactly the same argument as before.

222
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:06,630
You just calculated this limit and the five these are true and four now decreasing,

223
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:17,320
while for the left hand side on the negative card is not decreasing for the positive part is not decreasing and a zero it is also non decrease.

224
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:24,180
So globally is also non decreasing. Right. You can you can see that a way to draw the figure.

225
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:33,310
Okay. And finally the right containing the two paths on the on the nothing part and the positive part is always continuous.

226
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:36,820
The only one that is not continuous is actually kind of zero.

227
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:44,910
So what we need to show is that for acts equal to zero, this function is a right continuous.

228
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:53,620
That's all that's left to show.

229
00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:05,870
And in order to show that, you just follow the definition of right continuous and you can say that that actually holds out or of horrible conditions.

230
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:17,110
Now we can confirm that this function is also a pseudo EVA and it has a chunk, even if it's a combination of continuous function.

231
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:22,150
And at this point, it's still severe.

232
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:27,490
So then of the order to show some function is sitting up.

233
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:37,180
All we need to do is to follow this four conditions, check them one by one, and all of that all are satisfied.

234
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:41,890
Then we can conclude it's a clear function. Any question?

235
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:46,459
Yes. Or just to your x or to check for?

236
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:50,930
Right. Continues. Is it always from x equals zero? Can it be on the x on?

237
00:34:50,980 --> 00:35:01,700
No. Just in this particular case, since we know that this function is continuous for X plus last x less than zero and a far greater than zero.

238
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:04,880
So for those parts, we don't even need to check. To check.

239
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:08,410
Right. They are continuous. Of course they're going to be right. Continuous.

240
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:16,300
So the only point that we need to manually check is this activity for the zero point because it's not continuous.

241
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:21,010
Now we need to see whether it's a right continuous at that particular point.

242
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:38,230
And now the question is, can you just graphically draw an example of what it would be look like to be non continuous,

243
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:42,880
a function that is not continuous, continuous.

244
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:52,450
That's easy. So if you slightly modify this function, the definition of this function to be.

245
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:58,190
Right? That's right. Or any ads.

246
00:35:58,310 --> 00:36:01,880
Well, that's always one zero. It's always taken this formula fine.

247
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:04,190
As greater than zero. Always taking this formula.

248
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:14,360
Then what's going to change is that instead of having this to be a hollow point, this to be a solid point, it's going to be switched, right?

249
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:26,360
You're going to have. There's going to be a satellite phone and that's going to be powerful.

250
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:33,130
And if that's the case, if that's how we define the function is not continuous and actually quite a zero,

251
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:37,450
because if you approaching zero from the right hand side,

252
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:47,710
if you construct a sequence of X approaching zero from the right hand side, it's not going to be equal to the actual value of this function at zero.

253
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:59,740
So it's not right at. Any other questions?

254
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:14,660
All right. Okay. So a short summary of this of this part.

255
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:21,590
We introduced this random variable so that we can now discuss everything on the real space.

256
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:26,150
Essentially, this is called induced probability space.

257
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:33,950
It induced a probability space on the real space by mapping this original triplet,

258
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:41,530
the sample space as the sigma found a and the probability function key to this new trapezoid.

259
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:49,280
The real space are these barrels. So be on the real space and the CDF function.

260
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:55,310
And the reason why we put our city after city, our function instead of a original probability,

261
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:59,330
recall that our original probability is defined on our original sample space.

262
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:03,950
Right. And the city app is really specific to the random barrel.

263
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:10,280
So this city, our function tells us everything we need to know about the original probability.

264
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:14,630
So this new trouble is called the induced probability space.

265
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:23,210
Again, if you if you want to describe a event, the probability of the event equivalent,

266
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:27,830
describe that using the random variable and this three components.

267
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:33,980
And in particular, this is a real, real, real space is just a generic.

268
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:39,950
Right. What really matters in this city, our function, the real space and the present are pretty generic.

269
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:45,550
So the city app is really the key for defining these use probabilities.

270
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:58,130
And as you can say now, for any problem, all we need to do is to define a random variable and calculate this probable city our function.

271
00:38:58,610 --> 00:39:04,340
Once we have those two, pretty much we can describe any events that that is of interest.

272
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,440
So it's much more convenient than the original notation.

273
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:14,060
And that's why people use rhinovirus a lot.

274
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:20,360
And we sometimes referred to the sample space of a random variable,

275
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:30,260
sometimes referred to as the sum of space of a random variable which will be taken to be the value of these are not a random variable takes off.

276
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:34,370
So that's just a slight abuse of the notation.

277
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:42,230
Instead of calling the real space a symbol space, we just call what this rhinovirus actually takes value to be the sample space.

278
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:45,770
And a random variable can be of different types.

279
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:55,730
It can be disparate and be continuous, and it can be a hybrid of two because it only takes these different values,

280
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:59,750
finite or to contemplate infinite values. Then it's discrete.

281
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:05,480
And and if it takes uncountable, infinite, different values,

282
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:12,170
the more specific by the CDF function is continuous, then the random variable is also continuous.

283
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:21,200
Well, I'll talk a little bit more about that in a second. And finally, there could be scenarios like the one that we just saw where you have a jump.

284
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:30,880
Otherwise it's all continuous, nice and mixed. So we do have probability, mass probability, one point and something other points.

285
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:36,950
They all have their zero probability. But that doesn't mean that they cannot take value.

286
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:48,650
Sometimes that alternative points may well definitely see different rhinovirus, also different types.

287
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:58,340
They are all examples. But any question before I move on to talk about density and DNA.

288
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:06,379
All right. So now let's introduce another definition.

289
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:09,470
It's the identical or distributed random variable.

290
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:15,799
So we call we have now clearly defined what a random variable is and we can have definitely

291
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:22,160
have more than one right about if two run of our was decided by the following causation.

292
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:37,460
Then they are called identically distributing the condition is every set a in this moral said, the probability of x belongs to this.

293
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:41,810
A equal to y belongs to this set.

294
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:46,070
Then we call them to be identical. They distribute.

295
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:53,340
Here. The tea is ready for every step, every possible browser.

296
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:59,400
We always have this equality. Then we define the two to be identically distributed.

297
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:07,290
So a natural question is is identical way distributed?

298
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:19,500
Random variables imply they are equal when out of words does identical distribution means the two random variables are the same.

299
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:43,750
I do think. Well, let's first look at the other direction.

300
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:50,530
If two variables are equal to one another, are they identical or distributed?

301
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:55,140
It's a travel question, right? Of course they should be right.

302
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:59,560
The if they are equal, it means they are defined exactly in the same way.

303
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:06,190
So of course, they should satisfy all of this equation for any set in this far outside.

304
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:11,950
So these they're at point. What about the other direction?

305
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:15,430
If you're running marbles, they are identical, distributed.

306
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:19,810
How we conclude that they equal to one another. The either.

307
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:23,350
Can we conclude the two random variables are the same? Yes.

308
00:43:24,290 --> 00:43:37,520
Now. I mean, like, if you think about like weight and height, for example, they're different things, but they might be distributed very good.

309
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:43,850
So I like that argument. So the the answer is they are not.

310
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:52,670
Okay. Let's say an example that is given in the boat tossing three coins.

311
00:43:53,270 --> 00:43:56,990
If I toss three coins, then we got three outcomes.

312
00:43:57,450 --> 00:44:12,800
I had as a Tail Tell-Tale Heart, etc. If I didn't know how to run, a variable has to be the number of hat and a y to be the number of tails.

313
00:44:18,810 --> 00:44:28,380
Or the three for the three tosses. We can say that these two runner variables, actually, they have identical distribution.

314
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:33,000
They are identical in distributing, but they are not equal to one another.

315
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:37,140
All right. So first, let's say why they are equal.

316
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:43,590
Both are antiviral defined in this way. How about a sample space of one?

317
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:49,260
Zero one, two and three.

318
00:44:50,510 --> 00:44:57,000
Right, because that's the number that they can possibly take any order to show that they are identical or distributed.

319
00:44:57,210 --> 00:45:05,580
We just need to show that for every single number, the probability of us taking that number and by taking that number is equal.

320
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:13,860
If the probability if the probabilities are equal, every sample point in the sample space,

321
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:20,520
then of course, if we take any any subset of the sample space,

322
00:45:21,090 --> 00:45:26,970
the problem is that the probability that this to run a variable is going to be is always going to be the same.

323
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:33,120
All right. So let's take a look at the probability of an equal to zero.

324
00:45:35,590 --> 00:45:44,530
His wife. What's the probability of having zero has out of three courses one over eight.

325
00:45:44,890 --> 00:45:50,410
Right. And not is the same as the probability of having three tails.

326
00:45:55,150 --> 00:46:00,100
And the same as having the probability of having zero tails.

327
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:09,880
Similarly, you can right the probability of having.

328
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:23,030
I think one is equal to the probability of life or to two is equal to what?

329
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:28,590
To have one out three houses?

330
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:34,320
What is the probability of that? You.

331
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:46,880
All right. That's great.

332
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:55,430
And that is also the probability of us equal to two and probability of 1 to 1.

333
00:46:56,580 --> 00:47:08,460
So we can see that indeed, for every value in the sample space, the probability of X and Y taking the same value is always equal.

334
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:13,050
So that way we can conclude that at an a y.

335
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:28,350
All right. Then they call it distributing, but apparently they are not equal.

336
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:34,200
In fact, tax is always equal to one three miles away.

337
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:45,830
Right. In this case, they are perfectly clean here, which is a definition that we'll introduce later.

338
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:51,180
But they are not equal. They are identical distributed.

339
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:54,350
But they are definitely not equal. They're all the same.

340
00:47:55,400 --> 00:48:00,440
So this example I just announced is a clear example of the previous argument.

341
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:06,530
Identical. Distributed does not necessarily mean the two running marbles are the same.

342
00:48:12,570 --> 00:48:18,780
Both parents want an identical weight distribution around about the following two hour equivalent hours.

343
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:27,480
Another way to say identically distributed random variables is that they have the same CDF by X.

344
00:48:29,330 --> 00:48:35,360
And conceptually, they think this is this is true because as we argued before, our city,

345
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:41,599
our function tells us everything about a distribution of around about a third of our wealth.

346
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:46,729
There are identical distributed. That should mean the same thing as to Sydney.

347
00:48:46,730 --> 00:48:50,540
Our publishers are equivalent to one another or two of city.

348
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:55,270
Our functions are equal to one another on average in the real space.

349
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:08,600
So this is based. She is a theorem that you can use to show some random variables they are going to distribute.

350
00:49:09,130 --> 00:49:13,590
You can so that they are sitting out functions are equal to one another.

351
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:26,839
Then they must have identical distribution. So as a quick proof, if you want to show to or anybody else identically distributed,

352
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:33,860
if you want to show that they have equal sitting out for every acts, then by definition.

353
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:49,060
And he said, Hey, we know the probability of had you called to us today is always equal to a Y along to it.

354
00:49:49,700 --> 00:50:02,290
That's the definition. If we're like there's a to be a locked open, right closed set from infinity to answer.

355
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:11,320
Then we have the probability of at last how it acts equal to the probability of y last are equal throughout.

356
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:18,960
And what is this? This is the city. All right?

357
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:24,720
It's just the city out of your value add is smart, and this is just the city.

358
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:29,350
Why evaluate spots?

359
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:35,250
So that concludes if two round of our walls are identical distributed,

360
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:45,450
we definitely going to have the city our function to be equal at our reax and to prove the other way.

361
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:53,560
We need to show that for having said again, we need to go with the definition, right?

362
00:50:53,980 --> 00:51:03,300
It acts as equal. We need to show that for every set, a place to run a variable always have the same probability.

363
00:51:04,350 --> 00:51:09,990
So it's a little bit tedious, so made in the class, but you can find the proof in the textbooks.

364
00:51:10,590 --> 00:51:16,880
And so it's the rely heavily on the on the construction of a second opinion.

365
00:51:17,130 --> 00:51:28,470
So it's a priority. It is not the focus of this course, but the idea is you need to follow the definition to show that for every single set,

366
00:51:28,770 --> 00:51:37,140
the two probability is always equal. But what I want to emphasize is that identically distributed random variables

367
00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:42,540
is essentially equivalent to say the CDF functions are equal at every point.

368
00:51:46,350 --> 00:52:54,690
All right. So let's take a break and come back to talk with you in just a little bit.

369
00:53:02,250 --> 00:53:09,000
Actually, that's true. That there are enzymes in the samples.

370
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:38,450
Yes. You know, when I look at the and I just looked at our results as well, I want you to know exactly what they did.

371
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:43,120
It's not the only person know.

372
00:53:47,380 --> 00:54:18,270
I mean, I understand you would be eligible for vaccination or something like that.

373
00:54:21,270 --> 00:54:25,860
All right.

374
00:54:26,490 --> 00:55:37,620
Let's talk a little bit more about I mean, I think I was on the phone to ensure that we couldn't with and even with the tax burden,

375
00:55:39,610 --> 00:56:14,190
I feel like a long way to go here because I think we're on the verge of a lot

376
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:42,290
of money from people who don't like what happens when you look at your chart.

377
00:56:49,290 --> 00:56:54,690
What used. Yeah.

378
00:56:56,350 --> 00:58:40,030
Yeah. But, you know, it's think it's a huge part of the population, which means that it's what is happening all over the world on television.

379
00:58:42,060 --> 00:59:04,380
It's just like recently about 127% closures.

380
00:59:04,650 --> 00:59:20,970
That's not a problem for me.

381
00:59:30,060 --> 01:00:01,230
I just wanted to make sure that every single one of us.

382
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:13,780
So, you know, so I mentioned that there are different types of running marathons,

383
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:18,060
discrete amount of running variables, continuous running variables that makes type.

384
01:00:18,810 --> 01:00:26,640
Now take a look at for this great on specifically we can also define additional functions

385
01:00:26,730 --> 01:00:32,150
that comprise a distribution for the roundabout for a start on the display right now,

386
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:42,060
which is sort of important since we are dealing with the run of animal that only take five months or infinite by the carnival.

387
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:52,670
So and that is essentially that's actually what we can do is to define probability for each central point for each caused by all of them.

388
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:59,310
And then the general distribution, the overall distribution of the run model and be totally categorized.

389
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:08,430
All I need to know is the probability at each sample point that actually is idea for probability mass function.

390
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:17,400
Let's take a look. If we're running out of a line, takes only a finite or accountable number of values, then the city of I mean,

391
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:31,510
as a summation of the last article to this argument acts the summation of the probability random acts equal to each balance.

392
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:39,270
And the reason why I'm writing to this finite hour, Carnival is summation of Carnival.

393
01:01:39,270 --> 01:01:45,530
Summation is because really there's only a finite carnival possible that is this amount of viral content.

394
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:56,480
All the other values basically have a zero probability. So this KDR function essentially says pre-sell into this finite or carnival summation,

395
01:01:57,380 --> 01:02:05,780
and that motivates us to define these individual probabilities as a function, to characterize the distribution itself.

396
01:02:07,610 --> 01:02:15,590
And more specifically, if the sample space is denied, as this has x1x2 all the way to infinity,

397
01:02:15,830 --> 01:02:24,110
then act can be written as a summation of all of the outside class or equal to have the summation of individual probabilities.

398
01:02:26,450 --> 01:02:30,709
And we define the property that when describing a random variable,

399
01:02:30,710 --> 01:02:38,390
we define the probability mass function or Tiamat as the probability of the random variable

400
01:02:38,390 --> 01:02:47,840
taking a particular value ax now towards the probability of a specific sample point.

401
01:02:51,980 --> 01:02:56,690
So by definition this is a function for any ax in the real space.

402
01:02:57,830 --> 01:03:07,580
And as you can say, it only takes known non-zero values if X falls into in our sample space, if it's somewhere else,

403
01:03:07,580 --> 01:03:15,780
if it's not belongs to the sample space, then this probability or this amount is always going to be zero, which is now the worst and only.

404
01:03:15,830 --> 01:03:19,970
This PMF function only takes non-zero values and finite.

405
01:03:20,270 --> 01:03:30,870
On Kondabolu infinite point by the example this is our x123 all the way to events and example.

406
01:03:31,850 --> 01:03:42,350
These are the values of our PMT function that only takes num zero values at this point and zero otherwise.

407
01:03:49,380 --> 01:03:54,690
And we do know the PM function using this small act as a prevention.

408
01:03:55,170 --> 01:04:00,690
Shall we use the subsequent ash to indicate this is a PM for the rest of our lives?

409
01:04:07,780 --> 01:04:17,860
With this notation, we can write that the relation between a Syria and the piano as a summation of.

410
01:04:34,650 --> 01:04:36,190
That's the radiation bit on the piano.

411
01:04:37,380 --> 01:04:49,360
Essentially, Cydia is just a summation of the qualified piano, as I mentioned, of the probability value at a certain point.

412
01:04:52,350 --> 01:04:58,570
So that piano that we can talk about, PDF probability,

413
01:04:58,620 --> 01:05:04,049
that's a function of continuous write about continuous right about what they purchase from a

414
01:05:04,050 --> 01:05:09,450
discrete random animal in that it takes uncountable the infinite number of possible outcomes.

415
01:05:10,350 --> 01:05:21,480
So most likely we cannot define the probability of having the probability of the random animal taking each individual value,

416
01:05:22,830 --> 01:05:26,200
because in some other definition,

417
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:30,210
the continuous random variable basically means if your function is continuous,

418
01:05:30,690 --> 01:05:38,219
if you are setting our function as continuous, we can see that on any value.

419
01:05:38,220 --> 01:05:49,320
X The probability of this random variable as taking my remarks by definition is a probability of at last time for that minus the probability of x.

420
01:05:51,090 --> 01:05:59,730
LARSON That's right. And the first one is if they use the city app notation, that's the app acts of acts.

421
01:06:00,510 --> 01:06:09,070
And the second one is essentially take an element of X and those two X factor.

422
01:06:09,660 --> 01:06:14,280
In other words, approaching X from the left hand side, the x.

423
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:23,520
Of Acts in five acts of acts as a continuous window approaching acts from both sides.

424
01:06:23,970 --> 01:06:28,720
Then I gave you the same bait, which is not an act, and it's going to be zero.

425
01:06:29,230 --> 01:06:36,400
In other words, if it's a continuous random variable, the probability of the event variable taking at any particular value is always zero.

426
01:06:36,970 --> 01:06:44,830
So it doesn't really make sense to define the probability in for every single possible outcome.

427
01:06:46,180 --> 01:06:53,079
Is that what we do is we take the derivative of the city and define it using

428
01:06:53,080 --> 01:07:00,610
this integration and the differentiation or a continuous random variable acts.

429
01:07:01,180 --> 01:07:15,280
PDA is a non active function and has to be now active which satisfy this relation to the left hand side is the city for this random variable.

430
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:24,940
On the right hand side is the integration from back to infinity to this value out of another function of to

431
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:35,530
80 x and this apart if this small aspects satisfy this relation with the city of every x in the real space,

432
01:07:35,860 --> 01:07:38,860
then we call this small effects the PDA function.

433
01:07:42,250 --> 01:07:48,070
In other words, you can consider this aspects as a direct derivative of the CTA function.

434
01:07:54,220 --> 01:08:05,330
So graphically. What that means is if you have a say, this is your small expulsion.

435
01:08:08,090 --> 01:08:20,720
What this violation means is that you can take the integration from that affinity to this particular value and the area under the curve as you are.

436
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:25,220
Acts of acts is our city idea.

437
01:08:25,820 --> 01:08:30,800
In other words, the probability of a run of our last are equal to X.

438
01:08:34,390 --> 01:08:46,030
So that's how this PDA probability density function is related to the probability or is it related to that as the function?

439
01:08:47,140 --> 01:08:53,230
Just the area and of the curve that is the corresponding CDF is corresponding probability.

440
01:08:56,730 --> 01:09:05,730
And similarly, you can define the area for any interval.

441
01:09:06,180 --> 01:09:13,740
For example, if you have a interval A to B, what is the area between this and B?

442
01:09:14,610 --> 01:09:23,840
Take this region. That's going to be acts of B minus itself.

443
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:33,160
In other words, that's going to be the probability of the random animal acts greater than a last article to be.

444
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:43,720
And sometimes you can also write it as a proper video answer where I am putting a blast on a beat,

445
01:09:44,350 --> 01:09:48,130
or the probability that sweeter than a less than beat.

446
01:09:50,210 --> 01:09:58,490
These are all equivalent because potatoes right of arable, the probability of the run of our taking out in particular value is zero.

447
01:09:58,910 --> 01:10:03,560
So it doesn't really matter whether you use it all or equal to are just equations.

448
01:10:06,650 --> 01:10:13,250
And strictly speaking, this is the most rigorous way to arrive this probability.

449
01:10:14,270 --> 01:10:17,720
These are all important ones. Any question?

450
01:10:26,710 --> 01:10:35,350
So in this course. Oh, well, just focus on this present tense where the seeds of.

451
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:46,150
When we talk about a continuous run of variables, the CTA is always smooth and differentiable so that you can go to the PDF by taking the derivative.

452
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:49,480
And when we talk about the note the.

453
01:10:52,480 --> 01:11:01,290
When we talk about the the continuous random variables, we always assume this differential differential ability of the city our function.

454
01:11:02,250 --> 01:11:03,600
But that's not always the case.

455
01:11:03,930 --> 01:11:12,600
You may encounter more complicated scenarios where it's a continuous random variable, but the CDF is not differentiable, not directly differentiable.

456
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:24,450
Now you have to to be careful how this PDA is can be calculated or can be derived from that that particular CDF.

457
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:34,950
So the bottom line is you always go back to this definition as far as the function, you can find a function that is satisfy all this constraint,

458
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:43,980
non-active and then integration for every point x nothing x is always equal to the city of function.

459
01:11:44,430 --> 01:11:48,360
Is a valid period for the corresponding city. Okay.

460
01:11:50,110 --> 01:11:56,820
In this class, we just focus on that basic case where you can't do irrigation correctly.

461
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:03,370
All right. A couple of conditions for a function to be a PDF or a piano.

462
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:10,000
Previously we have talk about the conditions for a function to be a severe write, basically about small conditions.

463
01:12:10,990 --> 01:12:15,460
Now let's take a look at the conditions for a function to be a PDF or piano.

464
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:25,330
It functions small acts of acts is a PDF or piano or around a variable if and only if is satisfied.

465
01:12:25,330 --> 01:12:38,620
The following two nations first is non-active for every on acts, and second in either sum to one or it integrate to one.

466
01:12:40,250 --> 01:12:45,170
If it comes to one on all values, then it's a piano.

467
01:12:45,770 --> 01:12:48,260
If it were to one night in Siberia.

468
01:12:51,860 --> 01:13:00,860
So that's the two conditions that you can check in order to verify that some function is a valid PDF or PMT function.

469
01:13:05,620 --> 01:13:15,700
So the proof is sort of trivial if you want to go from the left hand side to the right hand side flat.

470
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:25,900
So from a India-Pakistan function to show they have this two conditions that's dramatically different from the definition.

471
01:13:26,230 --> 01:13:28,960
Just by definition, you've got these two conditions.

472
01:13:31,270 --> 01:13:38,560
And if you want to show that any function that satisfies these two conditions is a PDF or a piano, we just need to notice.

473
01:13:40,270 --> 01:13:45,280
We just need to construct a another function that is.

474
01:14:11,700 --> 01:14:21,990
The idea for the proof from his connections to that small function is a pdf Akiyama is to construct another function.

475
01:14:22,380 --> 01:14:35,430
How to function. As long as we can show that this function constructed this way is a CDO, then by definition it is a this small is a PDF or a canvas.

476
01:14:36,240 --> 01:14:40,320
So that's the idea and the construction is is no greater.

477
01:14:40,470 --> 01:14:49,860
So this is exactly following the definition or PMI we just construct this acts to be the summation of all the acts.

478
01:14:49,860 --> 01:15:00,180
I's last article two acts a summation of this small attacks on one side and for PDF is just the operation of all the x,

479
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:04,630
all the all the values between nothing infinity and slogans.

480
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:13,559
Then use this to verify the four conditions by taking the limit to the infinity.

481
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:18,990
Whether this function is equal to one picture limit in the next name infinity,

482
01:15:18,990 --> 01:15:25,350
whether it's equal to zero, but it's not decreasing but is a right containing all three.

483
01:15:25,350 --> 01:15:33,540
Our four conditions are satisfied. Then you can conclude please an x x is positive.

484
01:15:34,140 --> 01:15:39,510
Then correspondingly this small function is a PDF argument.

485
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:49,690
That's the way to to prove it. Right.

486
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:54,400
So I'll amend the details here about that. You can idea at.

487
01:15:55,980 --> 01:16:02,160
Any question. All right.

488
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:14,960
This year we can directly get a candidate directly got this proposition that handing down an to

489
01:16:15,010 --> 01:16:23,970
function with a positive finance positive in integral or some can be turned into a PDF or PMA.

490
01:16:27,940 --> 01:16:35,090
Any that they function with a finite integral or some can be turned into a PDF for piano.

491
01:16:39,540 --> 01:16:48,480
So let's say. Each act is such a function that we don't want a zero.

492
01:16:53,330 --> 01:16:58,580
And it's going down to greater than zero on this set a an equal to zero.

493
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:07,060
Elsewhere. Then we can integrate.

494
01:17:10,990 --> 01:17:25,230
This function of a and we denote this integration as this number that at this value, okay.

495
01:17:25,930 --> 01:17:32,920
By definition, by the by the argument of this that a proposition I know K is a finite number.

496
01:17:33,340 --> 01:17:48,460
And then all we need to do is to divide this original function by K and define a new function that is the original house divided by K.

497
01:17:49,270 --> 01:17:54,700
Then you can verify that this new function essentially is a prime.

498
01:17:55,840 --> 01:18:00,190
Similarly, for our partner, you replace this integration by a summation.

499
01:18:02,470 --> 01:18:10,690
So the idea is really just to divide the original function by this finite,

500
01:18:10,900 --> 01:18:19,750
integral or finite sum so that the integral of the new function is one or the sum of the new function is a one.

501
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:28,600
And every time just suppose you can show that it's a it's a PDF function or function.

502
01:18:33,230 --> 01:18:43,400
Any question. So the PDF on PMI can also be can be determined by the CDF and vice versa.

503
01:18:44,510 --> 01:18:48,330
This is the relation between the PDF and function on the CDF function.

504
01:18:52,430 --> 01:19:00,829
By definition, this is this should be true.

505
01:19:00,830 --> 01:19:05,180
Right? So we define the PDF and PM directly from the CDF.

506
01:19:05,690 --> 01:19:11,450
And also we show that there is a 1 to 1 relation between the pdf PMA and the CDF.

507
01:19:11,900 --> 01:19:17,750
So conceptually this is true. And to prove it again, this is a pretty trivial prove.

508
01:19:19,790 --> 01:19:27,020
We just need to stop writing through this two scenarios that this creates a discrete case and a continuous case,

509
01:19:28,370 --> 01:19:33,140
and for both is essentially very similar. The only difference is why you use Amazon.

510
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:39,860
The other you use the integration. All right. And they can be determined in both ways.

511
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:47,010
So let me just show. A continuous case.

512
01:20:17,030 --> 01:20:20,990
Basically just this two equations, and I complete the proof.

513
01:20:21,170 --> 01:20:30,200
All right. You can get your PDF by taking the derivative of the city up so it is determined by Syria.

514
01:20:31,580 --> 01:20:37,470
Alternatively, you can go to our city by doing this integration of the PDF.

515
01:20:38,580 --> 01:20:42,260
So city is determined by a PDA.

516
01:20:42,830 --> 01:20:45,890
That's it. So that's the the proof.

517
01:20:46,280 --> 01:20:50,420
And of course, the assumption is that the city is differentiable.

518
01:20:51,380 --> 01:20:59,350
And as long as as I mentioned before in this course, we're just going to focus on this basic cases where city F is differentiable.

519
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:03,740
If it's not dispensable, then you have to divide the cases into more,

520
01:21:05,610 --> 01:21:10,820
more detailed, different scenarios at discussed but eventually the same conclusion.

521
01:21:12,170 --> 01:21:17,150
That we can always go from one side to the other side. Always got city app from the app.

522
01:21:17,210 --> 01:21:20,490
Akiyama I got pdf pm from city.

523
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:29,940
That's the relation between this two, which also tells us that the piano also tells us everything about the environment.

524
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:39,380
All we need to know about the distribution for the environment, same as the city at any question.

525
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:52,970
So that's the definition. So now let's look at a couple of examples of how to derive this pdf CDO from a PDF from CDO,

526
01:21:53,650 --> 01:22:06,170
the first example that acts to be a continuous running marvel with the following city.

527
01:22:22,170 --> 01:22:27,410
But this is a city of functions because it can verify the foreign foundations.

528
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:32,180
And then the question is, what is the period?

529
01:22:35,670 --> 01:22:45,650
Point is run a variable. And how do we do it?

530
01:23:28,270 --> 01:23:32,610
I'd say it's a continuous running marvel. The city app is defining this way.

531
01:23:33,390 --> 01:23:39,960
The question is, what is a PDA? What's your thought?

532
01:23:40,260 --> 01:23:50,570
How do we get a PDA? You want to take the derivative?

533
01:23:50,820 --> 01:23:54,230
Take the derivative. Very good of the city of.

534
01:23:55,130 --> 01:23:59,250
You know, it's a it's a continuous function.

535
01:23:59,940 --> 01:24:08,570
I think the derivative and the continuous and the small stuff is not globally differentiable,

536
01:24:08,580 --> 01:24:13,320
but once you draw it, you can find that is piecewise differentiable.

537
01:24:14,430 --> 01:24:19,620
And then that gave us the idea of how you can differentiate a CDO together.

538
01:24:21,180 --> 01:24:29,070
So let's look at this. Forgot it. First, let's just draw a rough picture of of this city out function.

539
01:24:31,460 --> 01:24:35,460
Well, any acts that's the last aren't going to zero in the city.

540
01:24:35,470 --> 01:24:42,460
I always take money with zero for eight and that's it.

541
01:24:42,820 --> 01:24:48,190
That's between zero and a one. I facts in contracts.

542
01:24:48,190 --> 01:25:03,820
It's identity function that are going to be. And if any acts greater than zero are greater than one, it's always equal to one.

543
01:25:04,310 --> 01:25:07,719
But this is what the city functions like. First,

544
01:25:07,720 --> 01:25:17,880
we can verify this is indeed a valid city function because it approached zero when exposed to infinity and equal to one

545
01:25:17,890 --> 01:25:28,060
when I go to infinity and from this sketch we know is now decreasing and in particular is strongly increasing from 0 to 1,

546
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:33,880
then stay flat otherwise and is globally continuous.

547
01:25:33,940 --> 01:25:38,140
Everywhere is continuous but is not always smooth.

548
01:25:38,650 --> 01:25:47,170
Is smooth for this three segments, but it's not smooth at this intersection point.

549
01:25:51,960 --> 01:26:00,750
But from campus, we know we can still take the derivative of this function for these continuous pieces, especially for.

550
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:13,750
At last, our inquiries zero are relatively speaking.

551
01:26:14,440 --> 01:26:19,660
If we want to take the derivative, we can only take it for less than zero, strictly less than zero.

552
01:26:19,690 --> 01:26:23,980
What is the derivative of this constant button? Zero.

553
01:26:24,220 --> 01:26:27,880
Right. And four acts greater than zero.

554
01:26:28,390 --> 01:26:31,690
Less than one. We can also take it a derivative. And what is the derivative?

555
01:26:33,670 --> 01:26:37,660
One and acts greater than one.

556
01:26:38,140 --> 01:26:47,800
A derivative again is a zero. And that gave us that list of acts of x function of the three segments.

557
01:26:49,060 --> 01:26:53,980
And for this intersection, point acts equal to zero and equal to one.

558
01:26:56,300 --> 01:27:03,620
Says It doesn't really affect how I define this profitability, how I define the distribution function.

559
01:27:03,890 --> 01:27:07,460
You can either put them here or.

560
01:27:13,500 --> 01:27:18,750
You can put a dummy in the middle. It doesn't really make a difference because this is a continuous random variable.

561
01:27:18,750 --> 01:27:24,270
So taking any particular value is always having zero probability.

562
01:27:25,080 --> 01:27:35,100
So this doesn't really matter. So if you draw the figure for this CDO function, some for this function, it's going to be a.

563
01:27:46,020 --> 01:27:59,220
Stop function so it's a zero everyone knows except for acts gallons two 0 to 1 that it takes a value,

564
01:27:59,880 --> 01:28:06,630
a constant value one and correspondingly for any acts between zero and one,

565
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:18,570
the area under this curve is the probability of this random variable taken by two x less or equal to x.

566
01:28:21,390 --> 01:28:38,670
The probability of at last, as is the area and what is the area that is the relation from zero to at c t which is essentially just ask yourself.

567
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:43,240
Okay. Any X greater than zero.

568
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:55,690
Later was well introduced that this is actually a uniform distribution and this random variable

569
01:28:56,020 --> 01:29:05,910
has such clear function and such constant PD function is called a uniform retinol in particular.

570
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:10,150
This one is a uniform random variable. The interval 0 to 1.

571
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:23,050
Any question. So let's take a look at another example.

572
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:27,880
Some of the random acts of.

573
01:30:10,020 --> 01:30:17,430
So AX has this idea of this form, what is the senior functions?

574
01:30:18,540 --> 01:30:33,780
So give you 3 minutes and try to derive the Syria from the pdf you want to add from 0 to 1 equal to two minus x from 1 to 2 and zero otherwise.

575
01:30:46,640 --> 01:34:03,340
It's. You got it.

576
01:34:10,050 --> 01:34:19,380
And so let's look at this together. So the owners who got the CD from the PDF, All We Need is integration.

577
01:34:20,310 --> 01:34:28,260
And I would always recommend squashing this PDA just to give ourselves a sense of what this ideal function look like.

578
01:34:28,680 --> 01:34:37,560
And then add account integration. So for this particular PDA, I've been drawing on the figure.

579
01:34:38,040 --> 01:34:50,820
First we noticed that the small space where this PDA is now zero, it just from 0 to 2, right everywhere else is always zero and from 0 to 1.

580
01:34:51,090 --> 01:35:00,059
It's an identity function that goes from 0 to 1 and from 1 to 2.

581
01:35:00,060 --> 01:35:08,790
It takes this function of form two minus x. So if I say hello to one, the 92 also find it looks like this.

582
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:12,360
We know this is going to be a continuous function.

583
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:16,110
All right. And it's decreasing to zero.

584
01:35:17,190 --> 01:35:24,750
When I reach, I actually want it to. So this is what the function log by now was to draw the PDA function.

585
01:35:25,140 --> 01:35:36,030
Now it's pretty clear what we need to do is to integrate these function, this piecewise linear function at every single time and every single X value.

586
01:35:37,140 --> 01:35:40,440
So we've got the expression for this function.

587
01:35:41,130 --> 01:35:53,280
In particular, it also tells us, give us the heads that we can consider the ax, go to different intervals first in this interval,

588
01:35:53,310 --> 01:35:57,930
then this interval in order to facilitate the calculation of this integration.

589
01:35:59,130 --> 01:36:05,070
Okay. In particular. These are facts function.

590
01:36:05,070 --> 01:36:15,210
This enables function is equal to zero in fact is less than or equal to zero or any acts between zero and one.

591
01:36:15,780 --> 01:36:19,800
What is the integration of the small banks?

592
01:36:22,440 --> 01:36:29,160
It is going to be acts here, right? This is going to be an area under this leaner curve.

593
01:36:29,940 --> 01:36:33,990
So what is the expression of a key function?

594
01:36:43,980 --> 01:36:51,320
Well, any acts between zero and one, what is the integration of these values?

595
01:36:52,980 --> 01:36:56,580
Spread over two. Very good. Square over two.

596
01:36:57,450 --> 01:37:01,100
And that's how we integrate this acts.

597
01:37:02,550 --> 01:37:09,360
And then when starting out a little bit trickier, if we go to as greater than one, not two.

598
01:37:10,140 --> 01:37:14,190
So then we are rated at a point where our value is a busy interval.

599
01:37:14,590 --> 01:37:20,400
Right. Then the integration. What do we need to calculate is the area here.

600
01:37:22,620 --> 01:37:27,930
It consists of two parts, right? The first, the triangle before one.

601
01:37:28,110 --> 01:37:31,290
And then the area for this one.

602
01:37:31,290 --> 01:37:51,120
Two, Max is. Yes, two x minus one half x squared plus two x minus x squared over two x squared over two plus one half.

603
01:37:51,990 --> 01:37:55,870
One of which. All right?

604
01:37:58,150 --> 01:38:02,920
I guess so. Ah, that's minus one.

605
01:38:03,520 --> 01:38:06,610
There you go. So we have to be careful with that calculation.

606
01:38:06,820 --> 01:38:15,500
Very close. That's the value.

607
01:38:16,040 --> 01:38:20,390
And to calculate that, again, as I said, we can separate it into two parts.

608
01:38:20,450 --> 01:38:25,010
Right. This figure really helps me to calculate this this integration,

609
01:38:25,370 --> 01:38:31,850
and it tells me that we can first calculate this the area under this triangle before one.

610
01:38:32,060 --> 01:38:36,680
And we know that's one half. One half.

611
01:38:36,770 --> 01:38:43,340
Right. And then we can calculate this area of this trapezoid.

612
01:38:43,970 --> 01:38:54,240
So that's going to be the integration of from 1 to 2, minus X, minus T eight.

613
01:38:58,100 --> 01:39:09,889
And this and I gave you this final result, if you integrate is two minus T, that's two T minus T,

614
01:39:09,890 --> 01:39:20,720
square over two I, we evaluated that X and one, and then I gave you this final result.

615
01:39:22,910 --> 01:39:28,940
So now, as you can say, we start to get some calculus, some derivation, some integration.

616
01:39:28,940 --> 01:39:36,590
So it's really a good time to go back and review the calculus material that I have learned before.

617
01:39:38,480 --> 01:39:41,650
From now, we're going to use this more and more extensive.

618
01:39:42,890 --> 01:39:49,430
And finally, for AX, where do I quarter to? What is the CDF value?

619
01:39:53,180 --> 01:39:56,450
It's always one, right? It's just the summation.

620
01:39:56,840 --> 01:39:59,870
It's just the area under this curve, which is the big triangle.

621
01:40:00,530 --> 01:40:04,130
It's always important. And that gave you a clear function.

622
01:40:05,330 --> 01:40:09,950
And then, in fact, you can also double check by looking at the city of function,

623
01:40:09,950 --> 01:40:18,650
by drawing the city our function to verify whether you satisfy all conditions by the approach zero of infinity,

624
01:40:19,040 --> 01:40:25,940
approaching one way at infinity and now decreasing end and right continuous.

625
01:40:27,320 --> 01:40:32,360
If any of those four conditions is now satisfied, it means there must be something wrong.

626
01:40:32,570 --> 01:40:35,750
Either a compilation is wrong or there's something else.

627
01:40:37,720 --> 01:40:41,270
That's always a good, good chunk of the work.

628
01:40:42,020 --> 01:40:46,550
We can sketch this pdf Cydia function.

629
01:40:55,670 --> 01:41:20,730
Looks like. So it's a pretty smooth.

630
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:39,600
And as to non-linear segments from 0 to 1 and 1 to 2 is known as the at one flat rate and any question.

631
01:41:47,580 --> 01:41:52,080
Okay. For the summary, let's look at another example.

632
01:41:53,220 --> 01:42:05,720
This is. So consider a function which acts equal to E to the.

633
01:42:15,350 --> 01:42:29,650
Consider this function. What is a constancy such that c h l acts is a idea.

634
01:42:33,080 --> 01:42:53,540
Take. So this is at function is defined as exponential the power of negative two x

635
01:42:53,540 --> 01:43:00,260
plus three and what is a constant C such that C time this attracts is a PDF.

636
01:43:03,140 --> 01:43:11,950
All right. So again, give you 2 minutes. You have this here.

637
01:43:38,490 --> 01:45:31,250
God is greater. Right.

638
01:45:35,590 --> 01:46:23,310
You got it. And what? About the actual number.

639
01:46:23,490 --> 01:46:31,230
What is your thinking process? To answer this question. How do we approach this question?

640
01:46:35,740 --> 01:46:45,420
Yes. To put us properly, we have to be integrated is to get zoo kids integrated.

641
01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:52,840
And that equates to what? Because this FC Ajax is a PDA.

642
01:46:53,180 --> 01:46:56,700
If we integrate the function, what should we have?

643
01:46:59,860 --> 01:47:04,509
I dislike that Google wants to sell us everything.

644
01:47:04,510 --> 01:47:07,810
Should be able to do suit and that's how we can see.

645
01:47:08,440 --> 01:47:16,750
Very good. So if we integrate this PDA function on this sample space accelerator, that zero s should be equal to one.

646
01:47:17,680 --> 01:47:21,010
That's one we know from the property of the PDA.

647
01:47:21,680 --> 01:47:31,120
All right. So if we integrate this three times data from X equal to zero.

648
01:47:31,660 --> 01:47:36,790
So I've seen infinity. The sky should be equal to one.

649
01:47:39,130 --> 01:47:50,650
And from there, we can actually do the integration of this part and an equation, or C we see that.

650
01:47:51,250 --> 01:48:02,440
And after you solve this, we've got 6.2, two times eight with an active three, and that's a constant B in order to make this integration point one.

651
01:48:02,950 --> 01:48:10,630
And the reason why we need this integration 8.21 is because for PDA, recall that if it's a PDA function,

652
01:48:10,990 --> 01:48:16,120
then if we integrate from absolutely nothing ability to actually infinity,

653
01:48:16,420 --> 01:48:23,560
it should be equal to the the probability of the sample space, which is one.

654
01:48:24,100 --> 01:48:28,900
All right, now give us the quality that we need to solve this constant C.

655
01:48:30,400 --> 01:48:41,920
Okay. I hope you all got it. All right. So as a quick summary of what we have learned, Jonathan, describe the distribution for us.

656
01:48:42,280 --> 01:48:54,910
For a random variable, we can either go from the CTA acts of X or we can use PDA.

657
01:48:57,280 --> 01:49:15,670
Our piano. In particular, we know that the city is any function that it has to satisfy foreign nations first.

658
01:49:16,170 --> 01:49:23,700
If you take the limit as goes to infinity, this function has to be 1/2.

659
01:49:23,820 --> 01:49:28,980
If you take the limit to the maximum infinity, it has to be zero.

660
01:49:29,670 --> 01:49:35,480
There has to be none. Decreasing.

661
01:49:35,980 --> 01:49:40,450
And finally as to be right continues.

662
01:49:43,350 --> 01:49:48,690
Yes. So that's the for equivalent condition for a function to be a CDI.

663
01:49:49,470 --> 01:49:58,680
And for PDF, we just need to be greater or equal to zero for any acts.

664
01:49:59,100 --> 01:49:59,520
And.
