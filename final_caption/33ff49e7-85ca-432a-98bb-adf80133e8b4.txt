00:00:10,208 --> 00:00:13,272
Hello, and welcome back to Nutrition 590.

2
00:00:13,272 --> 00:00:16,360
Have you ever heard the saying,
you are what you ate?

3
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,020
Well, what about you
are what your mother ate, or

4
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,860
even what your great-grandmother ate?

5
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:23,910
Can an experience in our ancestors,

6
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:29,020
such as famine, really affect
our health generations later?

7
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:33,130
In this module on how the epigenome
is inherited, we will first

8
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:37,940
understand the difference between
genetic and epigenetic inheritance.

9
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:43,880
Second, we will describe how the epigenome
is reprogrammed in both germ cells and

10
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,470
somatic cells.

11
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:49,080
And finally, we will describe
data showing how the effects of

12
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:55,290
pregnancy environmental exposures
can affect the next generation.

13
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:59,850
Before we dive into the biological
mechanisms of epigenetic inheritance,

14
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,620
we need to review general
biology knowledge.

15
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:07,560
That is, what is the difference
between mitosis and meiosis?

16
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,256
In cell biology,
mitosis is part of the cell cycle,

17
00:01:11,256 --> 00:01:16,475
when replicated chromosomes are separated
into two new nuclei meiosis.

18
00:01:16,475 --> 00:01:21,004
Meiosis, however, is a special
type of cell division that reduces

19
00:01:21,004 --> 00:01:26,190
the chromosome number by half, and
it creates four haploid cells.

20
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:32,130
And each cell is generally distinct from
the parent cell that gave rise to them.

21
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:33,210
Both mitosis and

22
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:38,080
meiosis are nuclear division processes
that occur during cell division.

23
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,890
However, there are a few major
differences I want to highlight.

24
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:48,520
First is mitosis happens in somatic cells,
which are also called body cells,

25
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:53,970
while meiosis happens in germ cells,
so these are the eggs and the sperm.

26
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:57,670
The purpose of mitosis is
cellular proliferation,

27
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:02,520
while the purpose of meiosis
is sexual reproduction.

28
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,780
In addition to genetic inheritance,
there is also epigenetic inheritance.

29
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:11,436
This occurs in both germ cells and
somatic cells, and

30
00:02:11,436 --> 00:02:13,965
is depicted in the graph shown here.

31
00:02:13,965 --> 00:02:17,063
Epigenetic marks,
including DNA methylation,

32
00:02:17,063 --> 00:02:20,060
are generally stable in somatic cells.

33
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:23,590
However, during at least two
developmental time periods,

34
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:27,470
the epigenome undergoes
extensive reprogramming.

35
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:32,145
These critical windows of
development include gametogenesis,

36
00:02:32,145 --> 00:02:37,505
as well as the early pre-implantation
embryo following fertilization.

37
00:02:37,505 --> 00:02:42,337
At gametogenesis, genome-wide
DNA demethylation occurs during

38
00:02:42,337 --> 00:02:45,727
the development of
the primordial germ cells,

39
00:02:45,727 --> 00:02:48,789
which go on to become the egg and
the sperm.

40
00:02:48,789 --> 00:02:55,201
This demethylation and remethylation cycle
is shown on the left side of the figure,

41
00:02:55,201 --> 00:03:00,442
and is thought to erase any previously
acquired epigenetic marks and

42
00:03:00,442 --> 00:03:03,900
reestablish sex-specific imprint marks.

43
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,560
At fertilization, which is shown
on the right side of this graph,

44
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,530
both parental genomes undergo
further epigenetic modifications.

45
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:17,860
First, the paternal genome
undergoes active DNA demethylation

46
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,360
prior to DNA replication.

47
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:25,270
Second, the maternal genome
undergoes passive DNA methylation

48
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:28,110
after several rounds of cleavages.

49
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:32,670
This wave of epigenetic DNA
demethylation is thought to restore

50
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:35,740
the totipotency of the fertilized egg.

51
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:40,890
However, some sequences are protected
from this epigenetic reprogramming.

52
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:45,350
And these include those imprinted genes,
which were established during the germline

53
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:49,870
reprogramming, as well as repetitive
sequences, which we want to remain

54
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:55,790
methylated, and heterochromatin, which is
found near the chromosome centromeres.

55
00:03:55,790 --> 00:04:00,110
De novo methylation of both the parental
genomes occurs around implantation.

56
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:02,156
With the embryonic lineages,

57
00:04:02,156 --> 00:04:06,407
including the intercellular
mass showing hypermethylation,

58
00:04:06,407 --> 00:04:11,532
in comparison to the extraembryonic
lineages, such as the trophectoderm.

59
00:04:11,532 --> 00:04:15,283
Here I want to begin to
explain that the mechanisms of

60
00:04:15,283 --> 00:04:20,650
exposure-induced fetal reprogramming
are quite complicated.

61
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:25,500
And epigenetic and epigenomic
reprogramming are just one of them.

62
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,450
You can see in the central
part of this diagram

63
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:33,750
that non-genomic modifications,
including DNA methylation and

64
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:38,850
histone modifications,
can occur after adverse exposures.

65
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:45,165
And can lead to alter gene expression, as
well as increased disease susceptibility.

66
00:04:45,165 --> 00:04:49,580
Exposure-induced fetal reprogramming can
also occur, as you can see on the right

67
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:53,790
and left sides of this graph,
through altered cellular environment.

68
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:56,890
But they are not the focus of this course.

69
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:01,940
As we begin to unravel epigenetic
inheritance, a number of challenges and

70
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,940
future directions have evolved.

71
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:09,920
Some of the challenges include, first,
ruling out the possibility of genetic

72
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:14,740
changes or mutations being
causal in the disease phenotype.

73
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:20,044
Second, it's also important to demonstrate
that the epigenetic effect is able

74
00:05:20,044 --> 00:05:25,280
to pass through generations and rule out
the possibility of direct exposures.

75
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,658
In fact, when a pregnant woman is
exposed to an external substance,

76
00:05:29,658 --> 00:05:35,490
you're not only exposing that generation,
but exposing two additional generations.

77
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:40,133
The baby that's developing in the womb,
as well as the baby's germline,

78
00:05:40,133 --> 00:05:42,724
which represents the third generation.

79
00:05:42,724 --> 00:05:47,282
And as you can begin to imagine,
we have a lack of multi-generational

80
00:05:47,282 --> 00:05:51,520
longitudinal studies in humans
because of our lifespan.

81
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:56,081
But it is also very difficult to
do this in animal models as well.

82
00:05:56,081 --> 00:06:00,886
So some of the future directions of this
field include better designing animal

83
00:06:00,886 --> 00:06:03,869
model experiments so
that we can look at multi and

84
00:06:03,869 --> 00:06:08,285
even transgenerational
environmental exposures.

85
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:12,785
Second, it's important to understand
whether epigenetic inheritance is

86
00:06:12,785 --> 00:06:17,120
generally adaptive or
whether it's always negative.

87
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,060
For example, assuming parents and

88
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:22,830
offspring live in negatively
correlated environments.

89
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:28,242
And finally, there's a lot of information
about maternal epigenetic inheritance,

90
00:06:28,242 --> 00:06:31,726
but there's a relatively lack
of information about how

91
00:06:31,726 --> 00:06:34,999
important the paternal
epigenome inheritance is.

92
00:06:34,999 --> 00:06:39,568
Therefore, future studies need to look
at not only maternal exposures, but

93
00:06:39,568 --> 00:06:42,620
also paternal exposures as well.

94
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:48,160
So we have shown that epigenetic effects
are able to pass through generations,

95
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,980
and much of this is
through animal studies.

96
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:56,004
However, in this slide, I want to focus
on a population-based multi-generational

97
00:06:56,004 --> 00:07:00,800
longitudinal study that can also look
at the effects of DNA methylation

98
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,310
over time and over generations.

99
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:07,716
This cohort is called ELEMENT,
and it's very special

100
00:07:07,716 --> 00:07:12,690
since it's an ongoing longitudinal
study that started back in the 1990s.

101
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:16,554
And so we have individuals who
were born in the 1990s, and

102
00:07:16,554 --> 00:07:20,360
we follow throughout their childhood and
young adulthood.

103
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:25,780
And now these individuals
are actually having their own babies.

104
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:29,300
When you begin to collect
not only phenotypic data,

105
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:33,860
such as markers of childhood obesity,
cardiometabolic risk, but

106
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:37,382
you also compare that with
DNA methylation levels.

107
00:07:37,382 --> 00:07:41,770
We can begin to look at the mechanism
in which early environmental

108
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:47,030
exposures can program the risk
of diseases later in life.

109
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:50,820
Some of the published ELEMENT studies
have examined the effects of toxicants,

110
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:53,800
the effects of diet,
even physical activity and

111
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:58,150
sleep patterns on DNA
methylation modifications.

112
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:02,590
But here in this figure, I want to
highlight one study that has been

113
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:07,850
conducted in ELEMENT looking at
exposure to the phthalate plasticizers,

114
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:13,657
which are found in many commonly used
products, DNA methylation of blood,

115
00:08:13,657 --> 00:08:17,245
and skinfold thickness among girls.

116
00:08:17,245 --> 00:08:20,885
If you focus on the top part
of this causal diagram,

117
00:08:20,885 --> 00:08:25,873
you will see that third trimester
exposure to one phthalate,

118
00:08:25,873 --> 00:08:30,365
MBzP, is negatively associated
with repeated measures of skinfold

119
00:08:30,365 --> 00:08:34,410
thickness in girls in late childhood and
adolescence.

120
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:39,240
However, by focusing on the bottom part of
this figure and including DNA methylation

121
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:45,390
of the H19 imprinted gene as a potential
mediator, you can identify a stronger

122
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:51,440
negative correlation between the phthalate
exposure on skinfold thickness.

123
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,060
And therefore,
including DNA methylation in ELEMENT and

124
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:58,760
other longitudinal cohorts can
help us understand the mechanism

125
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:04,128
behind certain diseases that
affect later in life development.
