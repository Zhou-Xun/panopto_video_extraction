00:00:10,313 --> 00:00:11,780
Welcome back to Nutrition 590.

2
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:16,590
In everyday life, if someone you know
is diagnosed with a chronic disease,

3
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:20,887
don't you pause for a moment and
try to figure out why they got sick?

4
00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:21,466
What caused it?

5
00:00:21,466 --> 00:00:26,050
And we may inevitably think well,
it's in their genes.

6
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:28,655
Or they really should have done this or
that,

7
00:00:28,655 --> 00:00:32,632
meaning their choices of diet exercise,
or even where they worked,

8
00:00:32,632 --> 00:00:36,530
really had an impact on
disease susceptibility.

9
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:39,750
In this video, we're going to open
up the traditional model of human

10
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:45,990
disease susceptibility to include
the exciting new field of epigenetics.

11
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:50,566
In this module, we will first
understand the traditional view of

12
00:00:50,566 --> 00:00:55,403
human disease susceptibility and
how epigenetic alters this view.

13
00:00:55,403 --> 00:01:00,159
Second, we will begin to examine
how environmental influences affect

14
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:04,980
epigenetic mechanisms and health status.

15
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:08,690
To begin, I'd like to introduce
the simple triangle here.

16
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:13,210
One of the biggest obstacles we
face in understanding human disease

17
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:19,710
is how various complex factors integrate
to influence health and disease.

18
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:25,130
In this simple trigram we represent
the view of human disease susceptibility

19
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:27,900
by three competing forces.

20
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,320
These are represented by genetics,
the environment,

21
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,620
which is broadly defined to include
not only toxic exposures but

22
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:39,870
also other stressors and
also dietary influences.

23
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:42,969
And the third factor is time or age.

24
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:47,914
Physicians, researchers and public health
practitioners typically try to hold one or

25
00:01:47,914 --> 00:01:53,980
more of these forces constant to better
evaluate variability in the third.

26
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:57,170
Take, for example, monozygotic twins.

27
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:00,160
We can use twins to hold genetics constant

28
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:04,610
to better evaluate the effects of
environmental variability on health.

29
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:08,790
If one twin has a different
lifestyle choice like smoking, or

30
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:12,180
a different job such as
one that uses solvents or

31
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:18,370
chemicals, they might have increased
susceptibility to chronic diseases.

32
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:22,643
On the flip side of the coin we can
hold the environment constant to better

33
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:24,615
evaluate genetic variability.

34
00:02:24,615 --> 00:02:28,893
An interesting example here is
the case of childhood lead poisoning.

35
00:02:28,893 --> 00:02:33,921
When even after carefully controlling for
known environmental influences on lead,

36
00:02:33,921 --> 00:02:38,735
such as the age and status of the housing
which can affect the amount of lead-based

37
00:02:38,735 --> 00:02:43,480
paint and dust that kids are exposed to,
African-American race continues to be

38
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:48,670
a significant independent predictor of
elevated blood lead levels in kids.

39
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:53,984
And it turns out this is due to genetic
differences in genes that help uptake,

40
00:02:53,984 --> 00:02:57,197
distribute and
eliminate lead from the body.

41
00:02:57,197 --> 00:03:03,481
And these variants also vary by race and
ethnicity.

42
00:03:03,481 --> 00:03:07,517
But even after controlling for
genetics, environment and

43
00:03:07,517 --> 00:03:10,422
other things such as educational status,

44
00:03:10,422 --> 00:03:15,925
monozygotic twins continue to display
differences in complex disorder rates.

45
00:03:15,925 --> 00:03:20,894
Likewise, on the right, genetically
identical animals that are reared in

46
00:03:20,894 --> 00:03:25,784
very similar environments, such as
the two mouse sisters depicted here,

47
00:03:25,784 --> 00:03:29,790
also display what we call
phenotypic discordance.

48
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:34,330
You can see that the yellow
mouse also has an obese status,

49
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:40,340
while the genetically identical sister
is brown and normal body weight.

50
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:44,110
Therefore researchers have
begin to evaluate variability

51
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:48,340
in the epigenome as a factor for
disease risk.

52
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:51,900
And here's where I'd like to first
introduce a short definition of

53
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:52,719
epigenetics.

54
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:57,245
Epigenetics is simply heritable changes
in gene expression that occur in

55
00:03:57,245 --> 00:04:01,940
the absence to changes to
the DNA sequence itself.

56
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:06,534
So now let's begin to overlay
epigenetics on the traditional triangle

57
00:04:06,534 --> 00:04:09,223
model of human disease susceptibility.

58
00:04:09,223 --> 00:04:13,000
Starting on the left side of the triangle,
the genetic force.

59
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,720
We know that variations in genes
that control epigenetic processes

60
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,010
can now affect our health status.

61
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:25,979
Second, we also know that our genome
is comprised of a large amount of

62
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:27,617
repetitive content.

63
00:04:27,617 --> 00:04:31,772
And this repetitive content
needs to be silenced, and

64
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:37,760
it turns out we use epigenetic mechanisms
to silence the repetitive content.

65
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,438
Moving to the right
side of the triangle we

66
00:04:40,438 --> 00:04:45,041
can begin to think about how
the environment influences epigenetics.

67
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:49,504
And in fact a number of different key
environmental exposures have already been

68
00:04:49,504 --> 00:04:51,311
shown to affect the epigenome.

69
00:04:51,311 --> 00:04:53,950
First, diet.

70
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:57,446
We know that both
nutrition overexposure and

71
00:04:57,446 --> 00:05:01,864
underexposure can affect
epigenetic gene regulation.

72
00:05:01,864 --> 00:05:07,193
Second, chemical or toxic exposures
such as endocrine disrupting chemicals

73
00:05:07,193 --> 00:05:12,936
like bisphenol A have been shown to affect
our epigenome and ultimate disease risk.

74
00:05:12,936 --> 00:05:19,386
Other stressors including maternal care
and C-section status have also been shown.

75
00:05:19,386 --> 00:05:24,300
And finally, we also know that physical
exposures, including radiation and

76
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:30,430
child abuse have also been shown to
affect epigenetic gene regulation.

77
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:34,780
Finally, on the bottom force of
the triangle we know that time

78
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:37,550
affects epigenetic processes.

79
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:41,973
In fact, we don't want the same sets of
genes expressed when we're 40 as when

80
00:05:41,973 --> 00:05:42,774
we're four.

81
00:05:42,774 --> 00:05:48,085
And one of the things you can see is
that cancer is a disease of aging.

82
00:05:48,085 --> 00:05:52,943
And now that we can evaluate the epigenome
we see that oftentimes individuals

83
00:05:52,943 --> 00:05:56,307
who have cancer have
an epigenetic status that is more

84
00:05:56,307 --> 00:05:59,190
like a 70 year-old than a 40 year-old.

85
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:03,713
I hope by showing this triangle again
you can now begin to understand there's

86
00:06:03,713 --> 00:06:08,097
a great amount of complexity involved
in these three forces when we begin to

87
00:06:08,097 --> 00:06:10,965
overlay epigenetics.
