1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:25,880
I think that was actually concerned because I had a relationship with the states.

2
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:37,950
I think I was part of Europe.

3
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:41,400
So I feel like whatever.

4
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:47,910
I think I made it right.

5
00:00:48,660 --> 00:01:00,070
But also weighing whether to make the gospel and Amir goes to the heart.

6
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:10,140
I actually like to think of it like a trust.

7
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:18,440
I felt like it was actually pretty awesome. This isn't an accident.

8
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,910
The bus I was on. Oh, my God.

9
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:33,030
Yeah. Better than the Yankees. Yeah. I got hit with the fight going by the Bush White House.

10
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:47,880
Yeah. So you start just listening to music?

11
00:01:48,720 --> 00:02:05,880
I would say I would change the subject and read, like, 90 years ago.

12
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:11,630
I don't think so.

13
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:21,360
I guess it's just, you know, making sure we were informed.

14
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:33,610
I listen, I didn't have to take classes for weeks.

15
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:45,410
And, you know, it's like it's not so much, so it's just about anything.

16
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:54,480
I think that was great, but we didn't really get started here.

17
00:02:55,090 --> 00:03:07,290
I mean, I think, first of all, I wanted to go back to the question that most people missed was the question number one.

18
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:13,319
And I didn't give you enough detail to inform you about the choices in this question.

19
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:20,219
So the original question shown here in White says, in order to prevent weight bias,

20
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:25,080
which of the following questions listed below is an example of insensitive communication

21
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:30,540
to use in a clinical setting with a patient who has Type two diabetes in class?

22
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:40,890
What I didn't include was more information. So if you are working in diabetes, the diabetes educator,

23
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:51,299
you get a certain amount of visits here and it is common that a patient would be on several different drugs to treat their diabetes,

24
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:57,390
including insulin, which causes weight gain, a lot of distress patients.

25
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:02,700
And that information here in yellow should have been included in this question.

26
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,780
And what I can do is I can I can throw this one out.

27
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:14,580
So here are your choices. The question would be, how has your weight affected your health status?

28
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:19,650
Are are there things you can do you can't do because of your weight?

29
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:29,850
And then, um, I can see which was the. Do you believe that your weight status is contributing to your health problems?

30
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:38,670
That the way this question is structured is let the individual tell their story, their side of the situation.

31
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,030
How do you feel about this? Do you think that this is an issue?

32
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:53,940
And that was so because anybody have any questions about this and everybody got the next to right.

33
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,820
Research studies have shown that the increased prevalence would be attributed.

34
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:03,690
To the correct answer here was these complex,

35
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:10,710
complex changes in the overall food environment and associated alterations in normative eating behaviors,

36
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:17,070
perhaps due to the high availability of highly palatable foods and changes in physical activity.

37
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:29,900
And then finally, question number three, which is the following statements on the impact of race, ethnicity and socioeconomic status.

38
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:37,790
On the prevalence of race in adults living in the US is correct. Food insecurity during childhood predicts future obesity.

39
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:43,550
Some studies like the paper, and we mentioned this in class, but not always.

40
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:52,100
Genetic factors explain large the large and increasing socioeconomic disparities in a place where genetics haven't changed.

41
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:59,749
So it can't be that poor. Sleep duration and quality may explain the increased prevalence of obesity.

42
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,860
All Hispanic people.

43
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:11,720
Well, the paper explored this hypothesis, and it depends on which population you're talking about in terms of changes in sleep pattern.

44
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:16,879
And then the correct answer was number two, you are latter day,

45
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:24,200
I should say disparities in the prevalence of obesity in certain racial, ethnic and socio economic groups is a multifaceted.

46
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:29,890
And it involves social, behavioral, developmental and biological mechanisms.

47
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:44,980
All right. So I'll post the next quiz for the end of the week and I'll look for that announcement on the canvass site in the next couple of days.

48
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:55,730
So today we're going to talk about the intense binge eating disorder, night eating syndrome and food addiction.

49
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:00,770
How many of you have taken the eating disorders course?

50
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:06,860
Couple of years are, and now you're in it now a lot of it.

51
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:13,520
Some of you are in it now. So this is just going to focus on these this disorder and these syndromes.

52
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:24,350
Okay. And so the learning objectives are today to be able to define binge eating disorder and eating disorders, food addiction.

53
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:32,480
Able to explain the contribution of highly valuable food and stress to binge eating disorder.

54
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:44,030
And anything that causes a negative affect can cause stress that can lead to can be a trigger for some of these things.

55
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:53,060
The able to identify neurobiological mechanisms hypothesized to be responsible for having an eating disorder.

56
00:07:54,360 --> 00:08:03,479
And then to understand the cycle of physiologic basis for our food addiction, the concept of food addiction,

57
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:07,350
whether you could be addicted to a food is highly controversial, as you will see.

58
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:19,950
All right. So very quickly, as just as a background, a medical diagnosis for eating disorders, this is complex.

59
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:29,430
This is these are serious psychological conditions involving persistent eating behavior characteristics.

60
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:38,440
That negatively impact oneself and affect the ability for one to function in everyday life.

61
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:50,790
So these types of disorders are diagnosed by a physician, usually a psychiatrist,

62
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:55,830
but they can be diagnosed by their other mental health professionals.

63
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:59,760
And the evaluation is complex.

64
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:08,820
There's first a physical exam and then there's a psychological evaluation, again, done by the mental health professional.

65
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,540
And then there are other tests associated with the evaluation.

66
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:19,740
And then after these tests have been done, a diagnosis can be given.

67
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:29,010
And the diagnosis for the eating disorder has to follow these strict criteria mentioned.

68
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:32,230
And they take the DSM five. This is the.

69
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:44,070
Reference that describes the characteristics that an eating disorder would have in order for you to receive this diagnosis.

70
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:53,170
And in regard to treatment, the treatment is multidisciplinary.

71
00:09:53,740 --> 00:10:07,510
It involves physician, a psychiatrist and all other mental health care professionals, perhaps people about a master's degree in social work.

72
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:15,879
And it involves registered dietitians who help patients with meal planning,

73
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:24,610
structuring their meal plans and making sure they're getting enough calories in time and having an overall well-rounded, well-balanced diet.

74
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:31,660
So it's a team approach to this. You get treatment for it by just one particular person.

75
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:41,180
So let's go over the characteristics of density disorder.

76
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,040
So first of all, what's a pinch?

77
00:10:45,850 --> 00:11:01,209
So it's a discrete episode when you rapidly consume an excessive quantity of food and it's it's not in response to hunger or metabolic needs.

78
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:06,160
There's something else that is thought to be responsible for this type of eating behavior.

79
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:15,550
And once one has stopped eating, they feel uncontrollably full.

80
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:23,580
And and it's the while someone is engaged in this type of eating behavior.

81
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:29,740
They feel like they're out of control. They cannot control the amount of food that they're eating at a given time.

82
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:35,380
And the food is usually in the form of highly palatable, something that they really like.

83
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:43,270
It's usually some kind of a dessert type of life high sugar, fat, salt food that you would like to consume.

84
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:50,450
And it's not just one time and never eat it every once in a while.

85
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:53,860
This is something that happens frequently.

86
00:11:55,690 --> 00:12:05,680
So you would this is a response that occurs where you would consume a large amount of food within a discrete period of time, within about 2 hours.

87
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:12,430
And in terms of the frequency would be about once a week for at least three months.

88
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:18,100
So again, this is adherence to the criteria set forth set by the DSM five.

89
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:28,500
But it also has to that these characteristics also have to satisfy be satisfied by some other descriptors, some other associations,

90
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:36,100
three or more, where the individual, when they're engaging in this binge eating behavior and would eat more rapidly than normal.

91
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:45,370
And this these episodes often occur while they're alone.

92
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:48,999
And it's thought that this binge occurs.

93
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,040
Why they're alone is because they would be embarrassed if someone saw them engaging in this type of behavior.

94
00:12:56,550 --> 00:13:03,570
Again. You eat till your uncontrollably full and the amount of food that's consumed

95
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:08,460
is a very large amount more than you would consume in that particular meal.

96
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,040
And it occurs again when you're not hungry. So there's not a metabolic need for this.

97
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:22,440
And then after the pinches occur, there's this feeling of disgust and disappointment in itself.

98
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:29,340
An individual can feel depressed or guilty in response after being jealous.

99
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:42,850
And when someone is engaged in the activity of participating, there is a marked distress again, because they feel that they're out of control.

100
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,930
Do not control their consumption particular time period.

101
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,250
It's not associated with purging.

102
00:13:54,400 --> 00:14:05,050
So after an episode occurs, there's not a inappropriate compensation, so there's no exercise or vomiting as a consequence of this type of behavior.

103
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:09,000
That's something.

104
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:19,260
So those are the characteristics of an episode of binge eating disorder.

105
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:28,140
And again, they receive the diagnosis and then treatment would have to satisfy their criteria that I've mentioned.

106
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:33,060
Have you gotten to binge eating disorder in your research yet?

107
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:42,300
We have to talk about the size of the spectrum for many of. So how common is this?

108
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:51,240
Well, when it comes to assessing these types of disorders, there are some statistics.

109
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,130
I'm not so sure about how accurate they are.

110
00:14:55,140 --> 00:15:02,160
But according to some of the studies that I've looked at, the most recent one was this one by about 2022.

111
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:08,250
It's that girls lifetime prevalence of binge eating disorder is about 2.6%.

112
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:19,770
Hopefully talking about estimates here. Often it's people get a better idea of how common these are when people seek treatment for eating disorders.

113
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:25,650
So getting a firm number in terms of the percentage of people that are affected is difficult.

114
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:32,690
These are these are estimates. More common is it occurs more commonly in women than men.

115
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:48,610
And the first appearance of this type, this type of eating behavior would occur in someone's twenties, should occur by the age of 23.

116
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:55,400
And you if you were to take a cross-sectional.

117
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,930
You have this, you would find that people better have a higher body weight.

118
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:08,470
The prevalence of binge eating disorder increases with the higher body weight.

119
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:17,080
And with this particular disorder, there are other common comorbid conditions.

120
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:21,940
There's various psychiatric disorders associated with this condition.

121
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:30,940
People who have difficulty with impulse control might might also have a speech disorder.

122
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:40,690
People who suffer from an anxiety disorder may engage in this type of behavior and have mood

123
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:47,560
disorders like bipolar disorder disorder that would be associated with this condition.

124
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:58,410
People who exhibit social phobia. And you would also see this of people who have experienced post-traumatic stress disorder.

125
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:10,080
So a number of it's it's very common for these individuals to have these psychiatric disorders, to have these this particular condition.

126
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:16,870
And at the very bottom it is.

127
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:24,970
Alcohol and substance abuse are commonly observed in individuals with activity as well.

128
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:31,820
So what causes this condition? Well,

129
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:38,480
people that have been studied with this condition seem to have the same type of neurobiology as somebody

130
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:49,760
who has substance abuse issues and which there's difficulty in reward processing and inhibitory control.

131
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:59,960
So there's very similarities between BPD and another other types of biological disorders.

132
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:10,130
And there have been a number of theories that have been proposed to understand or explain binge eating disorder.

133
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:19,630
There's the regulation model. And I'll go into detail about what this one is.

134
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:25,479
There's the food addiction hypothesis, which is a food addiction.

135
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,660
And the term as a term itself is highly controversial.

136
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:34,720
One of the experts in the field of food addiction is Ashley Gearhart.

137
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:42,760
She's in our Department of Psychology here, and she's written extensively about food addiction.

138
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:47,980
There's an issue of impulsivity and lack of impulse control.

139
00:18:49,450 --> 00:19:01,810
And there's the observation that a number of people who have this type of eating behavior are restrictive in their dietary behaviors.

140
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:13,060
And when they're by themselves cause perhaps they've restricted calories, they're very hungry and they suggest an awful lot of food as a consequence.

141
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:19,950
And there are certainly a number of studies that have looked at genetics,

142
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:34,260
whether or not there are certain consistencies in the dopamine receptor expression or activity or a new opioid expression or activity,

143
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:39,720
and these receptors are involved in the word processing.

144
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:48,990
So there's been a lot of studies that have focused on similarities and those particular

145
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:53,610
genetic backgrounds and whether or not somebody engages in this type of behavior.

146
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:02,620
So what's the effect?

147
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:15,950
Regulation models? Well. It proposes that the binge eating occurs in response to negative emotions are impulsivity and impulsivity.

148
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:28,540
So what do I mean by that? So if you have social interaction that makes you feel bad, or it could be something else that causes a negative emotion,

149
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:37,420
and this can cause a bit of stress response to this negative experience.

150
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:48,130
And as a consequence, there is some impulsivity in terms of engaging in and consumption of highly palpable food.

151
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,820
And the theory behind this is that you're escaping the feelings of this negative emotion.

152
00:20:55,870 --> 00:21:01,449
So people are directing their attention to a highly palatable food because it takes their mind off

153
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:10,780
of that negative interaction that they may have or it could be to set the negative self-assessment.

154
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:27,070
So that binge occurs to get your mind off some may it could be not just an interaction, it could be a negative self assessment.

155
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:33,820
It could be related to anything that you feel bad about yourself.

156
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:47,590
The idea here is that you're escaping the negative emotion that you experience, and negative emotion can be used by lots of different things.

157
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:53,890
And once you're engaged and eating something that you find highly desirable.

158
00:21:55,180 --> 00:22:06,580
Get your mind off of those negative emotions and you're fully engaged in that experience with that particular food, and that has rewarding properties.

159
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:16,870
So you wouldn't find a binge that would occur in response to other types of foods.

160
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:24,400
So it's the highly palatable food now that activates the reward centers in the brain that do this.

161
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:32,020
So in the absence of highly powered food, whether it's in response to.

162
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:43,390
So there's also the food addiction hypothesis.

163
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:52,090
And as an addictive substance, this is highly controversial in the world of psychology.

164
00:22:52,100 --> 00:23:03,010
But I'll go through this. So individuals with high impulsivity and reward sensitivity, that means they respond a bit differently to food reward.

165
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:10,960
They may feel it almost get a high from the consumption of a highly palatable food.

166
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:18,399
So the response is similar to what you would see in somebody with substance abuse.

167
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:28,170
But the effect if you were to measurement, to measure activity of a dopamine response, for example, that wouldn't be as potent.

168
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:30,660
And I'll show you an example of that here in a minute.

169
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:41,390
So again, the experience of the food addictive response occurs in response to a highly palatable food,

170
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:46,820
a favorite item that may be specific to an individual.

171
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:55,670
And it's usually in the form of things that are high in sugar, fat, salt that are pleasing to the palate.

172
00:23:56,210 --> 00:24:03,530
Activate these four pathways in your brain and produce this pleasant sensation.

173
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:14,570
So individuals would have a desire, a strong desire to consume the substance during a binge.

174
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,860
They have a difficult time reducing their intake.

175
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:27,740
So this is where the idea of the food addiction is is responsible for this consumption of a high, unusually high amount of food.

176
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:37,700
And afterwards, there's a negative emotional state idea, your ability to support you when the substance is stopped.

177
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:43,380
So in this way, it's similar to other type of addictive processes.

178
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:54,010
But again, the notion that government can be effective is highly controversial for a bunch of reasons.

179
00:24:54,390 --> 00:25:02,400
Got to show you. Sure. So let's get that up.

180
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:06,120
And I should have right before class. Let's just go through here.

181
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:13,450
We'll go back to the treatment here. So the other thing that you've got to realize, and I just checked this again.

182
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:16,720
Sure. My references are still up to date.

183
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:20,920
There's really no definition for food addiction.

184
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:29,320
It's a hypothesis that has been proposed, doesn't have a strict criteria that you would see for binge eating disorder.

185
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:36,310
It's just a hypothesis that might contribute to binge eating disorder.

186
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:47,260
So and again, it's a highly palatable food that had the potential to trigger this response.

187
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:53,590
So you're activating the reward centers in your brain, dopaminergic opioid receptors that.

188
00:25:54,650 --> 00:26:08,920
Wanting and liking pathways. And of course, you've had all you have had approaches this class where you had to read a paper on liking and wanting.

189
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:18,180
So you're familiar with that dopamine system. It's involved in motivation and processing of reward, among other behaviors.

190
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:30,089
And so a highly palatable food can increase the concentration of dopamine in the striatum and other associated areas.

191
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:37,710
So in this way produce a similar type of response to consuming substance.

192
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:47,250
So I think this I'm going to come back here. Here's what I'm talking about when there's controversy to.

193
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:56,190
Comparing substance abuse to food. So this was a slide that was published.

194
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:59,909
This figure was published in Nature Neuroscience a long time ago.

195
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:06,719
It's still very relevant today. And it's the dopamine connection in this particular study.

196
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:17,730
They're looking at whether or not this pathway could explain food addiction and show similarities to substance abuse.

197
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:29,640
And perhaps this is why you can see someone present a strong association between having a higher BMI and having these conditions.

198
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:42,240
So in this particular study, looking at dopaminergic pathways and these two graphs, they're looking at the percentage of basal release of the brain.

199
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:47,130
So these are these studies were performed in rats.

200
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:57,059
And if you look at the bottom here, this is what happens to the percentage of basal release of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens.

201
00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:04,350
Several parts of the brain in response to amphetamine you get in terms of this percentage of basal release,

202
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:14,790
about 1,000% response, which I mean, very quickly within within an hour and the dopamine levels drop.

203
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:20,440
Top, you see a different response curve.

204
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:28,900
So in this case, you have the same baseline here about times down here that occurs.

205
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:39,100
That's something that would have been given to a preferred normal chocolate cookie or chocolate morsels, something they're familiar with.

206
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:52,930
And they get a spike in dopamine release. But it's at a much lower magnitude, you see, in comparison to a highly addictive substance.

207
00:28:55,030 --> 00:29:01,930
So they share the same characteristics, but the response is much, much lower.

208
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:07,790
Yeah. I don't know if you mentioned what kind of food was used there for the rodents.

209
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:11,330
Were there sort of characteristics? This would be a highly palatable food.

210
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:19,639
I don't know exactly what was given, but you can conditioned a rat to have a preference for a particular food type,

211
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:23,600
and they figure it out pretty quickly that they like chocolate morsels,

212
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:31,669
for example, or a chocolate cookie or vanilla wafer because their food is pretty bland and provides them with all the calories and,

213
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:36,920
you know, micronutrients. And if you give them a highly powerful food, you get this type of response.

214
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:55,350
So. So as I showed in the slide, there are some characteristics, some features that are similar.

215
00:29:55,350 --> 00:30:01,890
We get an increase in dopamine, but the magnitude of that response is not nearly as much.

216
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:12,120
So there are other things that you see and substance abuse behaviors that you don't see.

217
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:21,329
And you know what they're calling it? Addiction. So. There's no engagement in hazardous behavior,

218
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:28,260
engaging in behavior and hundreds of situations that you would see in somebody who is gauging substance use.

219
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:28,860
In other words,

220
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:39,780
people won't go out and steal money or rob a bank so that they can get their next thinks of whatever the highly colorful food that doesn't happen.

221
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:51,020
So that the desire, the drive to consume that particular device or initiative item is not nearly as high in

222
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:58,680
terms of what you would see in somebody who has a substance abuse or alcohol abuse problems.

223
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:10,020
They may fail to fulfill major obligations, but don't see those types of situations with people with or perhaps due to food addiction.

224
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:17,940
And as I mentioned, there's a lack of the potent stimulation of dopamine.

225
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:21,630
It happens, but it's not merely about.

226
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:25,460
It's about a much lower percentage, certainly less than 10%.

227
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:29,320
What you would see in response to that. Yeah.

228
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:33,390
Kitty, just as far as like the magnitude of the dopamine,

229
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:42,170
because a lot of other enjoyable activities stimulate dopamine to a similar extent that it was like Huggies,

230
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:52,340
but no one would ever say that like an addiction or like just like listening to music or going for a walk like these things all stimuli.

231
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:56,610
So just the idea that like it's addictive, it really is.

232
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:59,790
Dopamine is ridiculous to me.

233
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:05,219
But there are people who are positive. Like it's it's more of a behavioral addiction.

234
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:10,400
It lines up much more as like a behavioral addiction similar to like campaigner exercise.

235
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:22,680
Yeah, in some ways, it's, it's there's a better comparison to food addiction and it seems to change exercise addiction,

236
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:29,100
perhaps, you know, you don't know what this response would look like in this situation.

237
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:41,070
But it's real enough for a lot of people because in their careers working on films, I haven't I have not read theirs.

238
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:45,540
And then the other thing here, lack of major physiologic symptoms of withdrawal.

239
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:50,850
So I share some characteristics, but it doesn't have some of these negative consequences.

240
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:55,920
So, yeah, it's it is highly controversial.

241
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:06,500
Okay. So I went through it.

242
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:15,680
And if you have somebody who has this condition of abstinence, is it possible to stop smoking?

243
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:22,490
You could stop gambling. You can cut down on your exercise and you can go without illicit drugs.

244
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:30,700
Right. So this came up in the paper, too, but it doesn't differentiate between foods.

245
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:40,610
So, yes, you can abstain from all food, but if there are specific properties across these responses that you could say,

246
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,390
oh, yeah, that's that's a good point that you make.

247
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:47,570
You can abstain from certain types of foods. But again.

248
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:57,390
In terms of meal planning and structure. That really helps and binge eating disorder in general.

249
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:04,200
But you wouldn't want to completely restrict about a highly favored item with one of us.

250
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:09,530
No, I'm not going towards like whether it's the right approach or not, just specifically for the.

251
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:21,199
Yes, yes. So cognitive behavioral therapy has been used in this particular situation.

252
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:26,750
And I'll mention this again when we get to our overall treatment of binge eating disorder here.

253
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:34,440
You'd want to provide somebody who has this condition a wide variety of foods in their diet,

254
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:40,690
provide with them with flexible eating patterns and having planned meals.

255
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:46,620
It's structured is also. So accurate.

256
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:55,190
It's something at the price. And that was for treatment. Yeah. I'll give the treatment life back to these other things.

257
00:34:56,530 --> 00:35:05,240
It's not a fiction. So there's the issue of pulse control and impulse is thought to be.

258
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:13,860
Function of regions of the brain within the insula and the frontal over column.

259
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:17,560
And then here are the structures we're talking about.

260
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:26,270
So if you peel away this parietal speculum, you'll see that that area within the insular insula right here.

261
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:34,960
And it's thought that within this particular region of the brain, there's neurobiology that affects impulse control.

262
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:45,580
So with many people with mental disorder, they have they display symptoms of low impulse control activity.

263
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:59,440
And it's thought that structures known to control impulse have some differences in the neurosurgical structure of the brain.

264
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:06,190
So inhibitory signals that would normally turn off some of these impulses aren't happening.

265
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:11,800
So it's that neuro biologic response or lack of a response, I should say.

266
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:16,870
So there's the impulse to control the food.

267
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:22,090
And once they engage in the activity and turn it off happens.

268
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:30,240
It's due to a lack of these inhibitory inputs that would normally suppress that type of thing.

269
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:37,030
That way, that the genetic influence could be very strong response.

270
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:45,900
There's dietary restriction. There's there's now mixed results.

271
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:56,760
So the onset of a binge eating in relation to dietary behavior and restriction and a number of studies,

272
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:07,200
cross-sectional studies conducted in the nineties showing clear, clear association between dietary restraint preceding up injecting behavior.

273
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:15,030
Subsequent studies done in the 2000 suggest mixed results.

274
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:21,120
Dietary restraint occurs prior to binge eating only about half the time.

275
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:29,130
And there are a bunch of studies are due by Thomas Blot and Thomas Lord,

276
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:37,230
Director of the Eating Disorder Clinical Studies section at the University of Pennsylvania,

277
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:41,100
who's done a lot of work on behavior eating, eating disorders.

278
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:49,679
And his he came up with a conclusion that little evidence of moderate or mild mild

279
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:55,530
calorie restriction precipitates binge eating episodes compared with other interventions,

280
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:59,690
such as he has used to treat women and obesity.

281
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:03,510
And I think what he's referring to here is structure.

282
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:09,329
So if there's mild or mild or moderate calorie restriction in people with the syndrome,

283
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:16,590
and if you give them structure and their diet, you don't see this type of behavior.

284
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:23,610
But I'd have to say that, you know, you'd go without food for a long period of time or you experience calorie restriction,

285
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:31,830
you get really hungry and it could precipitate events. So ideas about it's yes, it's tied restriction, dietary restriction.

286
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:40,680
Not clear if there's a controversy in terms of whether or not this is the answer, the reason why this type of behavior occurs.

287
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:50,050
All right. And then lastly. Genetics.

288
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:53,749
So. There are associations.

289
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:59,530
Again, associations. It's hard to show a cause and effect relationship here with these types of studies.

290
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:03,050
So you have these genome wide association studies.

291
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:09,320
They look at people who have certain characteristics and they find that there's some commonality

292
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:18,860
in their genetics and regard to receptors in the brain that affect rewarding activities.

293
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:31,520
So looking at serotonin transporter and dopamine receptor D that say that the response that you get wanting

294
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:42,200
and then in this particular type of snap or polymorphism that the transporter doesn't work as well.

295
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:49,250
So you get less dopamine transported. So it takes a stronger stimulus to activate this type of a response.

296
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:58,370
And then similar sorts of differences have been shown with a new opening receptor.

297
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:08,360
This has been linked to binge eating disorder, and this is the response that you get that is liking responses.

298
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:15,230
It's you're experiencing the pleasantness of taste from my experience of a particular food.

299
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:21,920
And this after isn't performing normally.

300
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:28,820
As a consequence, the signals that are initiated downstream of that receptor are less robust.

301
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:35,000
So perhaps it takes a greater stimulus to activate that pleasing response.

302
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:40,460
And as a consequence, you consume more to get that same sensation.

303
00:40:45,680 --> 00:41:05,880
Okay. Now let's go back to. So the treatment for binge eating disorder that is used in psychiatric practice is a cognitive behavioral therapy.

304
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:16,230
And cognitive behavioral therapy has been shown over to somebody who has this type of therapy that can reduce binge eating episodes by 40 to 60%.

305
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:23,419
That was mentioned in one of the papers cited in your reading of cognitive behavioral therapy.

306
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:31,560
You're essentially talking to someone, in your words, exploring links between your thoughts and your emotions and your behavior.

307
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:39,090
Within this therapy. You're you're you're monitoring your behavior.

308
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:45,300
You're learning to think more flexibly, flexible about what you're doing.

309
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:54,090
In this case, it's eating behavior. During that response, you're stopping yourself and you're thinking, okay, I don't have to.

310
00:41:55,170 --> 00:41:57,180
Whatever it is in front of you, in all of it,

311
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:04,440
it's so much easier to essentially be more flexible in your thinking in terms of your your eating behavior.

312
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:12,930
Critical to this. And I've seen a number of recent papers on this in terms of structure and patterns.

313
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:19,830
Often people now this goes back to the the dietary restriction have or meal plan.

314
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:24,940
They don't eat enough calories during the day.

315
00:42:24,970 --> 00:42:30,160
When they get home and they're by themselves. There's a highly palatable food available.

316
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:39,510
And you have a tendency to go to that first because you're tired, you're hungry, and you know that food is going to give you some type of water.

317
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:45,010
If you structure your meals and plan to get enough calories throughout the day,

318
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:50,050
you can significantly reduce episodes that would occur as a consequence.

319
00:42:52,870 --> 00:43:02,409
And then there's also part of this cognitive behavioral therapy is improving self-esteem concerns, changing your concerns about your body shape,

320
00:43:02,410 --> 00:43:11,320
your body weight, perhaps separating your worth, your self-worth from your perceived appearance and your perceived body shape.

321
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:19,090
So this is also an important component of this type of therapy your self-worth, your artwork, what you think you look like.

322
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:28,690
And you can separate these two. It can reduce that this negative aspect that might occur that can trigger this type of response.

323
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:34,680
And there's a number of medications that have been approved.

324
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:40,740
I should say there's one medication that is this is an antidepressant.

325
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:45,210
It's the only FDA approved drugs for binge eating disorder.

326
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:50,940
And you would only get this if you had this diagnosis. It would prescribe this drug.

327
00:43:51,810 --> 00:44:00,210
And this particular drug has been shown to decrease binge related, obsessive thoughts and compulsions.

328
00:44:00,990 --> 00:44:06,180
So this is an effective way to treat this condition.

329
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:10,200
And this type of medication has been found to be very effective.

330
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:15,820
Okay. Yeah.

331
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:19,460
Does that mean you have to be on the police?

332
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:22,940
I mean, what about taking an income?

333
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:29,690
That's a good question. Do you take it the rest of your life? Is it effective the rest of your life?

334
00:44:30,570 --> 00:44:34,190
So for short periods of time, one or two years, it is effective.

335
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:37,850
But does that mean you have to be honest the rest of your life?

336
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:45,350
Can you can you develop other types of strategies that someone might rely more heavily on?

337
00:44:45,530 --> 00:44:50,060
You don't need to take the term. I don't know. That's a good question, because that's what I did.

338
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:56,060
I don't know if it controls impulse, compulsive behavior.

339
00:44:56,250 --> 00:45:04,270
Probably what this is going to do for the children for a long time.

340
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:19,790
So, yes. So for children, they are put on drugs that are stimulants that essentially provide some baseline stimulation.

341
00:45:19,790 --> 00:45:27,050
So they're less impulsive. They'll just impulse, impulse control and they might take it for the rest of their lives.

342
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:36,710
And there are side effects for that particular drug, but it can significantly increase the compulsive behavior and children that get in trouble less.

343
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:44,480
Perhaps they are less apt to endanger themselves and other people, let's just say.

344
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:52,010
I have I have two sons who have who were on a lot of these drugs, and they were very,

345
00:45:52,010 --> 00:45:58,130
very helpful in terms of keeping them out of the principal's office school.

346
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:03,770
They would not have made it through school without so much as that because we tried and it didn't work.

347
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:17,150
Okay. So. You have heard of Night Eating Syndrome and you're shaking your heads.

348
00:46:17,950 --> 00:46:25,540
So this is one that this is one that is less known about.

349
00:46:25,730 --> 00:46:34,930
It's thought to be a delay in the circadian pattern of eating, and it's evidenced by recurrent episodes of eating at night.

350
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:45,220
So when we fly at night, this would be after 6 p.m. it can be later in the evening, maybe, perhaps even after you've consumed your dinner.

351
00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:59,190
And so what with this type of eating behavior, there would be an overcompensation under which you're consuming more calories than you would need.

352
00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:07,020
And perhaps it's caused by not consuming enough calories during the daytime, or perhaps it's due to some other things.

353
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:19,130
It's hiding syndrome. It's different than somebody who consumes food and they're not aware of it.

354
00:47:19,990 --> 00:47:25,580
Somewhat like sleepwalking. You know, you've heard that the people would consume food, whether it's sexually asleep.

355
00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:31,450
This is different. This is consuming food while you're conscious after dinner.

356
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:35,740
And here's what the eating patterns look like.

357
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:42,510
So here's a control condition. And this is this is cumulative caloric intake.

358
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:47,320
So these are calories here on the Y axis. And this is time during the day.

359
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:56,920
And I don't know why this this hour scale goes always all the way up to 30 hours, but it just should be 24 anyhow.

360
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:02,230
So normal or the control caloric intake throughout the day.

361
00:48:02,470 --> 00:48:08,710
Here's breakfast, lunch, here's dinner. And then there's no more calories consumed after dinner,

362
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:18,310
I think around the curve in terms of a cumulative caloric intake and this is based on seven day food doctors.

363
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:25,470
This is what it looks like. There appears to be fewer calories consumed, particularly earlier in the day.

364
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:37,030
So if you're 15 hours so the amount of calories that are consumed in 15 hours here is about 7500.

365
00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:42,280
We have 15 hours. We're already up to 1000 here for the control condition.

366
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:48,190
And then at 20 hours, we saw a plateau in the control.

367
00:48:49,330 --> 00:48:58,150
Whereas in a person with 19 are people with diabetes, the caloric intake continues to rise throughout the year.

368
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:05,230
And if you were to break this down into an average, cumulative average,

369
00:49:05,470 --> 00:49:10,990
cumulative caloric intake of the individual and of an individual, here's the control.

370
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:14,350
You see that the pattern of breakfast, lunch and dinner, right?

371
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:31,000
So the number of calories or the average cumulative caloric intake shows these patterns in terms of the work intake over a given time period.

372
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:41,690
Uh, and so you breakfast, lunch and dinner with somebody who has this syndrome, the pattern is different.

373
00:49:43,170 --> 00:49:51,500
There's less consumption of calories at breakfast versus lower consumption of calories midday.

374
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:59,720
And the peak that represents food consumption at night is much higher here.

375
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:14,630
Yeah. I just think the area under the curve, it would be total area under the curve that most of the calories are consumed after the school holidays.

376
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,820
Well, again, these are estimates. You know, you're you're getting what?

377
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:31,450
Based on an assessment based on available data, 26% of the general population, it appears to be more common than binge eating disorder,

378
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:37,630
perhaps, but it depends on how you approach the numbers and how you come up with your.

379
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:47,200
So it's more prevalent individuals with higher BMI, people in our weight categories.

380
00:50:47,230 --> 00:50:54,900
Though some studies show no association with this pattern.

381
00:50:54,960 --> 00:51:05,460
Again, it's in the late teens. It's usually when people are out of their home where there's less structure for meals and planning.

382
00:51:06,090 --> 00:51:13,770
So you'll see this in people who have left their family households and go on to college or their living by themselves.

383
00:51:16,710 --> 00:51:28,920
And it appears to be kind of permission there could be getting back to this

384
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:36,270
type of behavior as a response to a life stressor consuming fewer calories.

385
00:51:36,690 --> 00:51:39,870
They consume more at night promises, greater sensation.

386
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:50,650
Unlike some of the other eating disorders, this is common, just as common in men and women.

387
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:57,610
So men and women who have this condition, there's not an equal number of women who have this type of.

388
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:05,920
And in terms of how people feel about not eating single.

389
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:12,760
Well, women seem to feel more distressed about having this night eating syndrome as compared with men.

390
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:23,050
And how is this treated? Well, there there's there's drugs that have been approved for this.

391
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:31,510
Serotonin reuptake inhibitors seem to decrease the number of episodes that one might have.

392
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:39,470
There's cognitive behavioral therapy. There's events and studies that have looked at like therapy.

393
00:52:39,470 --> 00:52:46,080
Perhaps the individual isn't awake when it's time to recognize it's a consequence.

394
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:50,809
They're not thinking about food, and if you're exposed to light for later day,

395
00:52:50,810 --> 00:53:01,370
perhaps it wakes you up eating your breakfast and you're consuming more calories and you might be hungry.

396
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:07,400
And then there's other therapies that have been used to progressive muscle relaxation therapy.

397
00:53:08,270 --> 00:53:18,260
Perhaps this is related to reading stress that one might experience during the daytime that would cause them to not be hungry during the daytime.

398
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:25,430
Getting home at night is not considered enough calories or consuming.

399
00:53:28,770 --> 00:53:36,410
So those are the eating disorders that I'm going to mention in this class.

400
00:53:36,450 --> 00:53:43,650
And these are associated with overall heavy weight city, but not all.

401
00:53:43,770 --> 00:53:48,750
Somebody might have a BMI of less than 25 and exhibit these same types of behaviors.

402
00:53:50,850 --> 00:53:56,150
So does anybody have any questions at this point about what we've talked about this?

403
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:05,840
Okay. I. My watch doesn't work anymore, so I've got a chance to get it done earlier today.

404
00:54:05,930 --> 00:54:16,740
That's okay. So the next class I posted the reading already on approval.

405
00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:24,959
And in regard to quiz number three, we did that work with all of your schedules,

406
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:30,510
having it opened on Friday and closed Sunday, and I didn't put a time limit on how much time you have to do it.

407
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:35,150
I want you to go back and look at your notes and have an informed response.

408
00:54:36,010 --> 00:54:39,770
Okay. So anything else before we get down a little bit early today?

409
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:45,710
Okay. I will see you again on Wednesday morning.

410
00:54:47,490 --> 00:55:12,290
And that's all for today. It is 635.

411
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:23,510
It is something for a lot of people in the market.

412
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:59,150
And it's very sad. And also I like to think about it because I was like, oh, I had to get them out of here.

413
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:06,470
Let me try that one. I know.

414
00:56:06,710 --> 00:56:12,090
I know. And I want to order them out of those other parts. So I'll meet you outside Texas.

415
00:56:12,290 --> 00:56:15,950
Yeah. I like how I saved your number there.

416
00:56:19,010 --> 00:56:38,400
You have to look at it. Oh, you are. Every moment that it has got me, and I can tell you is the one I know.

417
00:56:40,100 --> 00:57:00,940
So I think we probably have to wait until after we hear the day.

418
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:22,160
I hope that last one. Yeah, I think called The Monthly and it's like, oh, I can't keep up with something like that.

419
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:43,270
So I started when I was like that.

420
00:57:43,910 --> 00:58:05,840
So I don't mind because I worry that this is actually or it doesn't cause we suffer.

421
00:58:06,310 --> 00:58:37,100
I to you when you talk about corporate clients what's the Crown program and I should have actually I spent Australia

422
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:47,050
with this 1980s but I spent almost 2 hours come to make myself and try and just hear here here and a lot of it.

423
00:58:47,070 --> 00:59:03,750
Yeah. I mean these people who are experts are all trying to find us right now.

424
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:14,600
We're not going to promise. Yeah. Like that's kind of like to use for things like smoking.

425
00:59:18,330 --> 00:59:25,510
But now I think that's yeah yeah that's thing.

426
00:59:25,790 --> 00:59:34,370
I think that's what like I like that's.

427
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:41,070
I just think it's.

428
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:59,700
Yeah. Yeah. I was going to say to you guys that they say that because you sound like Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

429
01:00:00,010 --> 01:00:08,200
Like, oh, I put it in your head, coach.

430
01:00:09,590 --> 01:00:16,270
I see you. Yes.

431
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:25,960
You know. Yeah.

432
01:00:25,970 --> 01:00:30,410
So I guess it's just.

433
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:54,200
Oh, yes. Oh, yes. I work at home.

434
01:00:55,700 --> 01:01:05,029
I don't want to give up my pants because I think I have a lot of people that it's going to be.

435
01:01:05,030 --> 01:01:11,480
Yeah, it's going to be a whole phase. Very much so.

436
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:20,900
I have I have to decide what size six.

437
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:26,030
Size four is like the 2020s besides me in the waist, size six.

438
01:01:26,210 --> 01:01:29,360
It's just my legs is too big and placed.

439
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:49,360
It's like I'm so [INAUDIBLE] away from you guys until you, like, finally get, like, desperately designs.

440
01:01:49,420 --> 01:01:52,530
And I was. I say target.

441
01:01:52,540 --> 01:02:00,280
Usually it's like, hit or miss. They're like, sometimes they have chains built for thick legs, and other times they're like,

442
01:02:02,350 --> 01:02:06,250
I want to take her to sharing pictures to let her be proteins.

443
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:10,059
Those are amazing lives by those.

444
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:19,400
But there can be lastly, I mean, they don't always carry the but that's these are American people.

445
01:02:19,420 --> 01:02:25,930
And I found I found ironically, I found this pair and I know, but I found the other parents here.

446
01:02:26,710 --> 01:02:31,930
I got these are American people like, oh, I thought I was right.

447
01:02:33,610 --> 01:02:38,590
They said, just get a place that's expensive. Thinks they're kind of like the blue ones they are.

448
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:43,210
Meanwhile, they're doing the tags around for $12.

449
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:49,620
Have you been to the theater just to try to sell stuff?

450
01:02:50,780 --> 01:02:58,469
I know they're really picky on this one. They are very picky, but it's a good shot because they have like a lot of nice stuff,

451
01:02:58,470 --> 01:03:02,580
a lot of nice name brand stuff and it's like French supermarket and.

452
01:03:04,410 --> 01:03:08,650
Yeah, and it's actually pretty good. Yeah. Yeah, you should definitely.

453
01:03:12,770 --> 01:03:16,079
I was greedy. Oh, my God. Yeah. I was going to ask you.

454
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:20,870
I was like, how did the greeting go for this kind of person?

455
01:03:23,190 --> 01:03:26,400
Their responses. 10,000.

456
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:35,000
Students responses to the Food for Thought Assignment for students across the video.

457
01:03:36,420 --> 01:03:40,110
We're so bad and so bad.

458
01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:57,000
Like any shot. I wish I could tell you, but I think she forgot what the question is.

459
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:02,190
This the bullet point? I guess the point statement, focus point statement.

460
01:04:02,190 --> 01:04:05,459
And it was like, what are you saying?

461
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:10,680
It was like radio. And we're getting it from point to point out.

462
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:16,649
And then your response. Yeah. Or like the question sort of is like, what is your stance on this statement?

463
01:04:16,650 --> 01:04:20,670
So discuss why you feel this way. And it was like two sentences.

464
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:31,139
I like when it says discuss, you need at least like three or four sentences, handle some serious stuff.

465
01:04:31,140 --> 01:04:41,940
And she took on like I don't remember what exactly the conference instantly she's touching on stuff like weight values and stuff like that.

466
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:49,350
Yeah. Like so they like had a discussion questions that they had like how you felt like.

467
01:04:51,390 --> 01:04:54,570
Is that like, I don't know, like five or something.

468
01:04:55,330 --> 01:04:59,639
And I'm like, you're just like, wonder all through like me, like, really interesting points.

469
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:04,430
And like, so she set me down and then she was like, going to have others are like, I want to read something.

470
01:05:05,250 --> 01:05:16,470
And it was like it's like you could just tell that he was like. But there's like a hundred things, like a Jack Sparrow to make so highly of himself.

471
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:19,960
And he was like, I don't.

472
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:35,110
But I'm sure it's I think. Yes. So increasing the realization of laziness and lack of self-control in society today and like you.

473
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:45,210
One of the things that came to mind is the poison gas.

474
01:05:46,180 --> 01:05:52,540
For the definition of equity, it looks like.

475
01:05:52,570 --> 01:05:59,120
How did you get to this one?

476
01:06:00,090 --> 01:06:05,650
I found it like dance around the idea of equity.

477
01:06:06,470 --> 01:06:10,070
You know, it's like, you know, the baseball picture. Exactly.

478
01:06:10,210 --> 01:06:13,360
I'm pretty sure Sue shows that in class.

479
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:17,850
And I was like, either. You got that stupid or you weren't paying attention.

480
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:22,000
That's not the equity question. So what?

481
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:45,060
It's like, I don't know. Because they talk about like how vigils like to on the bomb disorder bombs things like that.

482
01:06:45,540 --> 01:06:52,720
And. The surface and crystal ball produced.

483
01:06:56,740 --> 01:07:05,830
I was like, that's like my favorite thing is likely to stop weight bias show that they stopped gaining weight and that's what I'm.

484
01:07:07,860 --> 01:07:12,650
Saying you're so close but you're so far you're so so ethical.

485
01:07:12,670 --> 01:07:15,840
All these are. I have say compared to.

486
01:07:19,140 --> 01:07:29,170
And I'm really glad that I did not start until I didn't fast, but I just didn't like the fact that it was like, Yeah,

487
01:07:29,210 --> 01:07:40,890
you can't really say that we can't listen to your addictions, but like we're going to say to these disease, XO, XO, there's hope.

488
01:07:40,910 --> 01:07:44,290
This next one is also the one that you can say as well.

489
01:07:44,330 --> 01:07:48,080
So I'm not going to be spewing genetics.

490
01:07:48,980 --> 01:08:01,889
I haven't read it yet. Okay. And they that's where we're not responding to trying to and I guess this is more genetic,

491
01:08:01,890 --> 01:08:13,550
because if they made a separate control like me and my is genetic and she's like, that's Tiger that I was like, actually, your my color is theirs.

492
01:08:13,700 --> 01:08:19,760
Your hair color is theirs. Their height is this is theirs.

493
01:08:20,150 --> 01:08:23,800
If your height and your weight is genetic, that would make sense.

494
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:28,370
That's two components of a mathematical equation is genetic.

495
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:32,880
I just I'm just here for the vibes.

496
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:37,100
You know, I feel like at this point, like primary care.

497
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:44,090
No, I honestly, if I'm going to say I'm writing whatever the [INAUDIBLE] I want appear for the times,

498
01:08:45,260 --> 01:08:53,180
I don't think I think I you know, I admire I'm a fighter.

499
01:08:55,520 --> 01:09:03,680
I don't know. Maybe. I mean, I know she was she was going like Gabby last year.

500
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:10,430
I should, like, highlight one word and be important to someone like that.

501
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:13,640
She went through, I think for one day. She went through like.

502
01:09:14,420 --> 01:09:19,070
Every single one of my comments was like, some of these are just like, can you define a step?

503
01:09:19,980 --> 01:09:25,250
And I was like, Yeah, but that's I, I think it was for a broken state.

504
01:09:25,670 --> 01:09:29,750
I don't think I had like it in the middle.

505
01:09:30,350 --> 01:09:35,450
I could not get above nine points and like, yeah, you just like something.

506
01:09:35,450 --> 01:09:40,240
I had to wait for something else to cause I guess.

507
01:09:40,810 --> 01:09:44,240
And then I was like, Yeah, I don't really.

508
01:09:44,420 --> 01:09:53,900
Or sometimes I've been like nine out of ten comments on my phone saying, Yeah, you know, it's like, I can't, but this is definitely typical.

509
01:09:54,500 --> 01:10:06,420
Yeah, it's something else to do.

510
01:10:07,940 --> 01:10:14,840
The quest for document, which is I think it was nine questions.

511
01:10:18,390 --> 01:10:23,940
And it took. She was a professional.

512
01:10:29,730 --> 01:10:39,370
We took it on different times. It was like, I think this client, she's like, there's only two other in my family.

513
01:10:39,550 --> 01:10:52,690
And I was like, I. So it was like it was a nine question play where high points and ask a matching question was worth $25.

514
01:10:52,830 --> 01:11:05,030
Like if I came back from whatever, I was afraid response and I was like, I should be.

515
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:09,790
It's like I was so close to rating. I'm sorry.

516
01:11:09,790 --> 01:11:12,820
I don't know. That's literally what I did like.

517
01:11:14,290 --> 01:11:18,240
I was like. I'm sure.

518
01:11:20,170 --> 01:11:24,010
I'm sure. Okay. I'm gonna go to class so I don't skip class.

519
01:11:25,220 --> 01:11:28,480
Guys, you got this.

520
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:43,570
Okay. Now. I just.

521
01:11:49,610 --> 01:11:58,990
Have you made any progress? You know, I really quite.

522
01:12:00,220 --> 01:12:05,950
I was talking to Christie and I'm like, I am not really sure what we're supposed to write about.

523
01:12:07,130 --> 01:12:18,640
I just basically struck down that that's what I was going to do, like expand Twitter if ask about like a format, it doesn't have a lot of text.

524
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:27,580
I think we went with the same format. I think a lot of room for like photos and stuff for like explaining things,

525
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:37,560
explaining explanations and interacting with competency, like, you know, incompetence.

526
01:12:41,430 --> 01:12:50,550
Because homegirl doesn't believe in [INAUDIBLE] rubrics. I then that was her and I was like, where did I like this?

527
01:12:50,940 --> 01:12:53,340
She's like, Well, I'd prefer it just because, like,

528
01:12:53,940 --> 01:13:01,400
everybody's internships are different because like you are really focused on points to it, like the [INAUDIBLE].

529
01:13:02,460 --> 01:13:06,780
Because like you said, I didn't get any points back, but I was like, I'm confused as to where I lost points.

530
01:13:06,780 --> 01:13:17,130
And she was like, you know, it's great. It's like, but I feel like now I feel like, you know, and I was like, No, don't [INAUDIBLE] dance with.

531
01:13:20,670 --> 01:13:25,460
I guess I really only have the words over when it comes on a photo.

532
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:28,940
I support these. This is just the words that were already there. These are actually my words.

533
01:13:28,950 --> 01:13:36,030
It's like, I know, but I deleted all the other stuff. I kept it there just so that I could have a faster memory.

534
01:13:36,330 --> 01:13:44,460
I don't know if this was. Please. I can't help you with health and the standards of authorship.

535
01:13:45,290 --> 01:13:48,630
And I was like, it would be really cool if I could have something.

536
01:13:51,250 --> 01:14:00,280
Okay. We're going to make a correction like sustainability, like St Patrick's.

537
01:14:00,850 --> 01:14:03,040
And then I was like, I want my preceptor.

538
01:14:03,340 --> 01:14:16,230
He's not going to get back to me fast enough to get this done because I made him a poster on Saturday, Sunday, Saturday.

539
01:14:16,540 --> 01:14:21,010
Also, I have a second job now.

540
01:14:22,420 --> 01:14:28,180
Where? At a coffee shop in Ypsi. It's just 6 hours on Saturday and Sunday.

541
01:14:29,410 --> 01:14:35,950
I'm outside the coffee shop and I was like, Hey, part of what I did.

542
01:14:36,950 --> 01:14:41,570
Elvis Presley. Yes. Good idea. Probably not. I know.

543
01:14:41,650 --> 01:14:51,490
I know that the last time I tried to give you. But here's my thought process that was like.

544
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:57,660
I was trying to do so many days that I went too much.

545
01:14:58,260 --> 01:15:09,450
I had the coffee shop here and the chocolate shop on the same day and like our schedule was really good and we're like, Now I get done.

546
01:15:10,610 --> 01:15:17,960
The latest 230 in the afternoon for classes like Thursdays at 230 and ten.

547
01:15:18,350 --> 01:15:25,610
Whenever Fridays we get down at 12 and if we're not doing first things down, then look at the rest of that day.

548
01:15:26,210 --> 01:15:30,480
And I don't have anything on Saturdays and Sundays. True.

549
01:15:35,090 --> 01:15:40,280
And this company shows like super sucking like a parking lot only has three spots.

550
01:15:41,780 --> 01:15:48,160
So, like, a lot of the traffic can be foot traffic. Unlike.

551
01:15:54,600 --> 01:16:05,300
I was pretty lucky. I have time to you.

552
01:16:10,690 --> 01:16:14,370
I basically had a conversation when I was there for like 5 hours.

553
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:18,450
I was like, Hey. Can't get to them.

554
01:16:20,670 --> 01:16:28,379
Are you wondering names like Jack you. Family gatherings, like things like weddings.

555
01:16:28,380 --> 01:16:33,920
Could you work like. Somebody told me I was like, I want to work 12 hours.

556
01:16:34,170 --> 01:16:37,890
I can't do six months. Like opening times. Like, you need a rest.

557
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:41,820
It's like 99% change. I was like, That is great.

558
01:16:44,190 --> 01:16:51,960
I know it's like some level concerning how easily, how easily you're tired, but it's really going to help.

559
01:16:52,650 --> 01:16:56,250
Yeah. Because you the entire five hour time there, he was there by himself.

560
01:16:56,370 --> 01:17:00,240
And I was like, I feel like the owner should not be there by himself on Saturday.

561
01:17:01,230 --> 01:17:08,520
So I just really was like, yeah. And I was like, I work in a coffeehouse campus.

562
01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:11,430
Oh, how's business? And I was like, okay.

563
01:17:17,590 --> 01:17:31,120
But then it was like I was like, do I have to sign like I-9 forms or are you just going to have to find something?

564
01:17:31,510 --> 01:17:39,280
I mean, that's what this article shopped it over to me because they would never get their [INAUDIBLE] together into their system.

565
01:17:39,850 --> 01:17:45,430
So I would just write checks and I would go to posit it so it wasn't taxed at all.

566
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:50,320
I was like, This is bad for absolutely my career.

567
01:17:51,370 --> 01:18:00,280
And it's like, I like to be taxed, so I know I'm going to be.

568
01:18:10,860 --> 01:18:24,780
Okay. So for science to this, like, I'm going to pretend I [INAUDIBLE] somebody or you like, [INAUDIBLE] me.

569
01:18:27,350 --> 01:18:30,500
And I was like, I want you to say I'm sorry.

570
01:18:31,010 --> 01:18:39,350
And she was like, okay, thanks for all your help. Like, if you give us the outs to not have assigned groups, like, I'm not going anywhere.

571
01:18:42,410 --> 01:18:48,550
But it's like a freight train. It's almost like it's.

572
01:18:57,100 --> 01:19:46,890
So. You also have to call.

573
01:19:53,270 --> 01:19:58,576
I'm really touched but told me so many changes of.
