1
00:00:01,042 --> 00:00:07,042
And now we're going to talk about Poll Everywhere.

2
00:00:07,042 --> 00:00:19,042
So Poll Everywhere is a tool that is not a university wide tool, like the ones we've talked about so far. Poll Everywhere is specific to the School of Public Health, we have a license for it.

3
00:00:19,042 --> 00:00:37,042
And so if you find something interesting or something you want to work with. We want to make sure we add you to our account, so that you're not limited by the free Poll Everywhere license restrictions, but it's a great tool for creating polls for your

4
00:00:37,042 --> 00:00:47,042
class. Good strategic use of poll questions are going to help you be able to assess student understanding on a topic.

5
00:00:47,042 --> 00:00:51,042
Alyssa ideas for a brainstorm.

6
00:00:51,042 --> 00:01:02,042
And, again, similar to how we talked about with the breakout rooms, it's going to create opportunities to hear from students that may not be comfortable speaking up in class.

7
00:01:02,042 --> 00:01:09,042
So, It integrates in so many different ways, sorry let me jump ahead.

8
00:01:09,042 --> 00:01:14,042
It's really flexible to suit your needs.

9
00:01:14,042 --> 00:01:18,042
It is.

10
00:01:18,042 --> 00:01:20,042
You can ask questions that are graded.

11
00:01:20,042 --> 00:01:38,042
It can be incorporated into Canvas, so that poll questions can be added into your Canvas site, and actually give students of grade in the gradebook for their participation in answering that question, or on the opposite end of the spectrum, you could set

12
00:01:38,042 --> 00:01:51,042
questions up to be anonymous, you know, perhaps you're having an in class discussion about things that are sensitive or you're asking for feedback or thoughts, and you want that to be anonymous.

13
00:01:51,042 --> 00:01:58,042
Now questions that appear on screen responses that appear on screen, or always appear anonymous.

14
00:01:58,042 --> 00:02:08,042
It's more on the reporting side for the instructor, to be able to see who answered what you can set questions up to be anonymous where it won't capture that information.

15
00:02:08,042 --> 00:02:12,042
It won't ask for names, and then you can let students know.

16
00:02:12,042 --> 00:02:20,042
Please share your honest thoughts please share your honest feedback because we're not capturing your names.

17
00:02:20,042 --> 00:02:23,042
As part of this.

18
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:31,042
You can ask questions that have a correct answer, or simply pulling for thoughts and ideas.

19
00:02:31,042 --> 00:02:39,042
And then again lending to its flexibility, you can present from the website.

20
00:02:39,042 --> 00:02:52,042
The poll everywhere.com website, or from tools that you already use. If you do lectures in PowerPoint or in Google Slides, you can incorporate them into your slide deck.

21
00:02:52,042 --> 00:03:09,042
So, the survey you took in the beginning, I added that I inserted, those activities into my Google slide deck with an integration tool.

22
00:03:09,042 --> 00:03:20,042
You're going to be able to pull everywhere allows you to use your questions and reuse them actually which is something that you can't do in zoom.

23
00:03:20,042 --> 00:03:30,042
Once that meeting is over, unless you reuse that meeting. you don't have access to copy those poles again.

24
00:03:30,042 --> 00:03:41,042
So it's nice if you want to use this across multiple courses or utilize maybe the same questions set for different audiences you can save them Poll Everywhere, and reuse them.

25
00:03:41,042 --> 00:03:57,042
You can also work independently, or we can create a team. So once everyone gets signed up, everyone in your teaching team, your size get signed up with their Poll Everywhere license and we've added them to the School of Public Health license.

26
00:03:57,042 --> 00:04:02,042
We can put you on a team, so you can share the same set of questions.

27
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:14,042
And one second. What that's going to do is you can meet with your size, create questions to us maybe during the discussion sections, and then come back afterwards, and look at the reports.

28
00:04:14,042 --> 00:04:29,042
Perhaps you set up. Knowledge Check questions to see how everyone is doing with the material you talked about that week. and then you can sort of come back and look at those reports across all the discussion sessions.

29
00:04:29,042 --> 00:04:33,042
So it has some really nice features.

30
00:04:33,042 --> 00:04:36,042
One thing I want to talk about.

31
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:45,042
I want to show you. So I have some resources here in the slide deck, but I'm going to jump over to my Poll Everywhere account.

32
00:04:45,042 --> 00:04:58,042
Because this really lends itself more to synchronous in PR fully everyone's in person or everyone's online together.

33
00:04:58,042 --> 00:05:14,042
One alternative work around. So for our classes where maybe some students are having to participate asynchronously or remotely in your class, and they're viewing recordings of your lectures.

34
00:05:14,042 --> 00:05:19,042
There's one tool here called pinned q amp a.

35
00:05:19,042 --> 00:05:25,042
Perhaps I create a folder, like I did for this workshop of questions.

36
00:05:25,042 --> 00:05:34,042
One thing I could do is after the class everyone is participated. I can then set these questions up.

37
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:38,042
Perhaps in a survey format so there one right after another.

38
00:05:38,042 --> 00:05:41,042
In the pinned area.

39
00:05:41,042 --> 00:05:47,042
Because one key thing about poll questions, is they have to be activated.

40
00:05:47,042 --> 00:05:50,042
So if I come over here.

41
00:05:50,042 --> 00:06:01,042
Right now our opening survey is still activated people can only answer the questions when it's activated. And in my slide deck and automatically activate and deactivate.

42
00:06:01,042 --> 00:06:08,042
What that means it's currently collecting responses, is an activated poll.

43
00:06:08,042 --> 00:06:11,042
And I think we're done with that survey so I'm just going to go ahead and deactivate it.

44
00:06:11,042 --> 00:06:25,042
But what I could do is group these questions in a survey and pin them, so that I don't have to activate or deactivate when my asynchronous students go to the link they will still see those questions.

45
00:06:25,042 --> 00:06:32,042
So there are sort of ways to make this work in both ways. Whereas, if they're viewing a zoom recording.

46
00:06:32,042 --> 00:06:40,042
And you're utilizing a zoom poll, they will be basically omitted from participating in that.

47
00:06:40,042 --> 00:06:51,042
So, we, we do need to set something up to allow them to participate as well. or just keeping these things in mind.

48
00:06:51,042 --> 00:07:11,042
So over here I have my activities and creating a new activity. And this kind of reveals your question types. So you can be as sort of simple or as creative as you want to be, and giving your students an opportunity to respond as little or as much as they

49
00:07:11,042 --> 00:07:16,042
might want to. So we have the standard multiple choice question.

50
00:07:16,042 --> 00:07:32,042
If you've been to any of the town halls and seen the word clouds that pop up. Those are nice brainstorming, or, you know, what's one word that captures something, a topic in your course.

51
00:07:32,042 --> 00:07:34,042
q amp a.

52
00:07:34,042 --> 00:07:48,042
This is not only can I provide a response so in our survey, you will provide an open ended responses. q amp a takes it a step further where I can go in and up vote responses and say oh yeah me too.

53
00:07:48,042 --> 00:07:53,042
Me too I agree with this statement

54
00:07:53,042 --> 00:07:56,042
clickable image is one.

55
00:07:56,042 --> 00:08:14,042
So how are we feeling here's a pain scale, how, how are you feeling about starting the fall semester in person, or juggling your remote and in person classes survey which is what I completed and the main idea of a survey is that it's more than one question

56
00:08:14,042 --> 00:08:16,042
in a row.

57
00:08:16,042 --> 00:08:32,042
These are just a single question, a survey is going to let me add additional questions, open ended is what I used what the question type I used in the survey and multiple choice was the other one.

58
00:08:32,042 --> 00:08:39,042
Now competition. This could be like an exam review type competition.

59
00:08:39,042 --> 00:08:44,042
It keeps track of who answers questions the fastest.

60
00:08:44,042 --> 00:08:49,042
And lets you see a leaderboard between each question.

61
00:08:49,042 --> 00:08:57,042
And so it's has the survey setup of I can do multiple questions one right after another.

62
00:08:57,042 --> 00:09:04,042
But here, it basically has students competing against each other to answer the fastest.

63
00:09:04,042 --> 00:09:09,042
So exam review or midterm review.

64
00:09:09,042 --> 00:09:24,042
If there are question types that work well for this. And it looks like they're limited to multiple choice questions. So that's a limitation, but create sort of a game out of your course content.

65
00:09:24,042 --> 00:09:32,042
There is a more option here which drops down many additional question ideas.

66
00:09:32,042 --> 00:09:39,042
They're typically built off the same sort of structures.

67
00:09:39,042 --> 00:09:52,042
But usually have a slightly different option, this two by two matrix is interesting. It's sort of like an image hotspot question.

68
00:09:52,042 --> 00:09:56,042
You could create an.

69
00:09:56,042 --> 00:10:08,042
x axis and the y axis and have students place themselves or answer a question by dropping an image in the quadrant.

70
00:10:08,042 --> 00:10:12,042
And again I can select a region that's the right answer.

71
00:10:12,042 --> 00:10:19,042
Or perhaps it's just an opening poll, and students are just giving their personal thoughts.

72
00:10:19,042 --> 00:10:22,042
So there's really a lot you can do with it.

73
00:10:22,042 --> 00:10:29,042
And so, that can sometimes be overwhelming to see the vast amount of options.

74
00:10:29,042 --> 00:10:38,042
What I would just encourage is, you know, sometimes just starting small and trying one thing, getting good at that one thing.

75
00:10:38,042 --> 00:10:44,042
And then as you get more time to work with it or you become more comfortable.

76
00:10:44,042 --> 00:10:51,042
Try something new and something different.

77
00:10:51,042 --> 00:10:56,042
Again, we're going to share these resources with you.

78
00:10:56,042 --> 00:11:04,042
I see your request to be put on the license I'm going to write your name down and make sure I send you that information.

79
00:11:04,042 --> 00:11:09,042
I have a link here which goes to our request form.

80
00:11:09,042 --> 00:11:11,042
Again, we have a video.

81
00:11:11,042 --> 00:11:19,042
I have a get started with Poll Everywhere document. If sort of reading through step by step instructions, it's helpful to you.

82
00:11:19,042 --> 00:11:26,379
We've got some examples and a list of the help guides which can be really helpful. And that's on the Poll Everywhere support site.
