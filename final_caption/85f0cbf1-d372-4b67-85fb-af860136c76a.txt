1
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:04,670
I want you.

2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,520
I would have my sister here.

3
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:22,260
I mean, she does cancer research at Harvard. Yeah, she's known for his works there.

4
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,270
So I think an opportunity like this is so far away.

5
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:36,500
Sounds like a good. I've never been involved before.

6
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:47,660
I really like the best way to it, because otherwise they might know every single treatment.

7
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:56,719
There's I that, you know, she was like I was only like, what's up in the trash?

8
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:01,410
I remember my friend and I was like, I love my husband.

9
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:06,520
And it was so cool.

10
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:16,459
I'm not sure that that was done and really like. But yeah, you know, I heard that she like the pope that way, you know, but that's cool.

11
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:29,330
So she does a good time. I don't really know, obviously, but I like the gloves because I don't get all that.

12
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:36,060
Yeah, I did.

13
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:53,420
I. Yeah.

14
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:10,200
It's.

15
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:25,521
I didn't think you would, said I do.

16
00:02:25,731 --> 00:02:37,211
I don't know what you are. I don't have any great care for one of the families and everything else.

17
00:02:37,441 --> 00:02:39,611
Not really sure they're going to like it.

18
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:54,761
This is like a lot of people don't like you, and I feel like you really think the room is reserved for at least about 30 minutes.

19
00:02:54,771 --> 00:03:02,561
And I guess you're going to take advantage here. Yes. Get hurt.

20
00:03:05,391 --> 00:03:20,151
That's how I look at it. Well, my mom and I like to think we were and using it for it on your own, in our reality.

21
00:03:20,751 --> 00:03:30,081
But when we have bigger problems, if you are interested in doing the same thing with any of the concerns,

22
00:03:30,111 --> 00:03:36,171
it's going to be something that you're comfortable working in a cool room.

23
00:03:36,621 --> 00:03:42,531
Kind of depends on how we want to listen. I don't listen to people too far and I'll be here for one more year.

24
00:03:43,311 --> 00:03:49,141
I know I shouldn't have your your last name. And I was afraid of that.

25
00:03:52,301 --> 00:04:02,901
Over the course of the year and the election, that was kind of terrifying perception was like or 5% in the polls like,

26
00:04:02,901 --> 00:04:12,961
oh my gosh, I have something to do with life. I think I feel right now what I did last night.

27
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:17,211
I mean, I do think it's like a lot, but like, yeah,

28
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:26,661
it's not like I'm going to be a little bit better than most of the time I took by the Internet at school because I think,

29
00:04:26,841 --> 00:04:32,781
well, I don't although like really serious.

30
00:04:32,781 --> 00:04:39,711
And I just I was like, so I hold my child.

31
00:04:40,161 --> 00:04:44,211
Oh, really? Thinking like that. You're so lonely by yourself quite a lot.

32
00:04:45,651 --> 00:04:58,691
You know, it's actually networking that is taking it, keeping it like that, because it becomes really important that it like, yeah, I understand that.

33
00:04:58,701 --> 00:05:08,371
I mean, you know, anything that you can I don't mean to be hard shoulder as far as I'm concerned I haven't done any you know.

34
00:05:08,421 --> 00:05:13,941
Yeah I think anything of that you kind of like I don't know, like I don't like these other departments.

35
00:05:15,171 --> 00:05:18,501
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.

36
00:05:19,011 --> 00:05:29,391
Well, they don't like this class. I really don't have that. This is like an intro to something.

37
00:05:29,511 --> 00:05:37,581
It's how you provide for sort of like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

38
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:44,271
Okay. Um, I was just reading about this, like, had something to do with kind of exemption.

39
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:48,831
I mean, over the past year.

40
00:05:52,151 --> 00:06:04,621
Yeah. Yeah. Involved with kindergarten, first year oh five years holders or higher almost office.

41
00:06:06,471 --> 00:06:14,561
So I don't think it's like everything I wanted to talk.

42
00:06:14,631 --> 00:06:21,981
Right. Yeah. Okay, that's cool.

43
00:06:22,971 --> 00:06:26,571
But I will say that my parents that I have a lot of parent background.

44
00:06:27,141 --> 00:06:34,880
Okay, so I was like I think it was harder to do that and like that.

45
00:06:34,881 --> 00:06:39,151
Really practical, I guess.

46
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:53,351
I learned the hard lessons that we have learned, too, that I really recommend it to people who think that they were like this.

47
00:06:55,031 --> 00:06:58,690
I was kind of like, okay, really, I'm not like that.

48
00:06:58,691 --> 00:07:03,701
So I this was overwhelming because we had like two assignments we had,

49
00:07:03,701 --> 00:07:09,551
we had the assignments and they were like two different roles and sent them to different movies like just working for completion.

50
00:07:09,551 --> 00:07:20,931
And I was like, so yeah, you're like, you know, thank you.

51
00:07:20,991 --> 00:07:26,381
I think, you know, you think I'm going to do what you think?

52
00:07:27,911 --> 00:07:39,551
Yeah, you want to be a part of a group, but you're probably not sure exactly how it's going to be with her specifically.

53
00:07:39,911 --> 00:07:49,371
And the same thing on Google Docs sharing kind of ask questions and I'm sure you know, but it would be really nice to know.

54
00:07:50,091 --> 00:07:54,281
Yes. Has his name so far like my name?

55
00:07:54,411 --> 00:08:01,131
Yes. Oh, Chinese.

56
00:08:01,331 --> 00:08:08,221
Yeah, yeah. I'm from Taiwan. So that's the one that's a really traditional world and.

57
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:13,810
Oh yeah. Video. I was learning Chinese there.

58
00:08:13,811 --> 00:08:20,800
I don't know Chinese that well. I was born there, but I was born in China and then I moved to the U.S. when I was four.

59
00:08:20,801 --> 00:08:28,600
So I don't know when I want to learn it again. And I said, Yeah, I needed a computer.

60
00:08:28,601 --> 00:08:33,340
And I was like, Well, this is a really cool, like, I say, like souvenir for Taiwan.

61
00:08:33,341 --> 00:08:41,761
Yeah. So it worked out well. Would you like to be a part of the Presidential Study Group for freshman year?

62
00:08:41,891 --> 00:08:54,571
Yeah. Yeah, right. And not sure what the format we might find out the information for freshman.

63
00:08:59,181 --> 00:09:04,081
I decided that first class was not like going over material.

64
00:09:04,521 --> 00:09:14,781
You know, there was only a week and as much as it ever did, not to be like material.

65
00:09:14,951 --> 00:09:19,091
But I heard that I had friends worse and worse and worse.

66
00:09:19,991 --> 00:09:24,801
She's actually pretty good, Professor. Really? Once you actually get into the material, she's pretty.

67
00:09:25,151 --> 00:09:29,480
Really good. Yeah. How did you open up the paper?

68
00:09:29,481 --> 00:09:34,671
I think more than I would, probably.

69
00:09:35,251 --> 00:09:40,941
Oh, really? Your mother on Monday? Yeah. We have also decided to do something about.

70
00:09:41,951 --> 00:09:45,231
I got. I'm not sure.

71
00:09:46,101 --> 00:09:49,921
There's no time. Oh, Road.

72
00:09:52,011 --> 00:09:56,361
Oh, that's what she was saying. Wait, so you had to keep it open?

73
00:09:57,021 --> 00:10:01,461
Because once you do it another time, you're like, if I have to.

74
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:23,160
I don't know how. So we want them to open up here and say, Oh, but you would be able to press it.

75
00:10:23,161 --> 00:10:27,691
And then there's a way out of that for me to come back to you.

76
00:10:27,701 --> 00:10:33,041
And she said, You have to keep these people on that.

77
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:41,541
I think that we'll have to see. Yeah, I'm going to have to think about the question of what it's like to be able to watch it.

78
00:10:43,701 --> 00:10:53,521
Yeah, I don't know. But there's a lot of all that other I don't have like five now or like for example or problems at like anybody.

79
00:10:54,141 --> 00:11:01,410
But yeah. This is my second semester.

80
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:07,221
I'm going to give you all degrees of work and they tell me that normally people do it

81
00:11:07,231 --> 00:11:12,161
in two and a half years or three years and I would think I would not be doing that.

82
00:11:12,211 --> 00:11:23,100
So I'm like, What are we going to do? I should say yes, but also I'm going to be nominated for like Citigroup.

83
00:11:23,101 --> 00:11:26,391
So that's what you're do. Yeah, that would be great.

84
00:11:26,401 --> 00:11:31,350
I don't know, I any of we are going to go into undergrad.

85
00:11:31,351 --> 00:11:37,771
It was in the film and that that is just so we can figure out over after this was so

86
00:11:37,771 --> 00:11:43,021
public out there with the hard times like biochemistry all those things across the world.

87
00:11:43,471 --> 00:11:51,691
Oh yeah. Oh okay. Yeah. So it's, it's really like the investment to be able to analyze the problem.

88
00:11:51,991 --> 00:11:59,001
Actually, I'm doing a lot of the homework is I'm working with, you know, shooting.

89
00:11:59,811 --> 00:12:12,141
Oh, okay. Yeah. I think. Ah funny. When she we were choosing pretty much because she had already been released from the speech.

90
00:12:14,821 --> 00:12:18,421
Are you in the epidemiology report?

91
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:23,521
No, not really. Next year it was one of chicken.

92
00:12:51,721 --> 00:12:56,071
Many of you to. Thank you.

93
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:56,761
Yeah, of course.

94
00:14:02,161 --> 00:14:23,341
Three year old the West Coast and and schedule that we're trying to create 200 years ago I think was like super short in watching him on Monday.

95
00:14:23,711 --> 00:14:31,421
Least she didn't even have access to schools for younger or younger ten years into this period.

96
00:14:31,441 --> 00:14:39,991
I don't know why it looks like that, but. Yeah.

97
00:14:41,721 --> 00:14:56,391
Yeah. Today's class is Chapter 30 year, which was it was like very short.

98
00:14:57,081 --> 00:15:01,601
But yes, I think the whole period.

99
00:15:02,241 --> 00:15:53,271
Yeah. Look at with the jaw on the bottom of this project.

100
00:15:54,791 --> 00:16:00,941
I want you to see it on the very bottom.

101
00:16:02,831 --> 00:16:07,821
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah.

102
00:16:10,311 --> 00:16:16,821
With my partner. I do this every day. Yeah. What do you call a white Tiger Woods?

103
00:16:17,421 --> 00:16:22,041
Oh, I don't know. For the counseling or.

104
00:16:22,551 --> 00:16:28,041
Oh, it's just a bad idea. I don't even know there's jokes in the world.

105
00:16:29,031 --> 00:16:32,531
No, I'm just friends.

106
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:39,711
Yeah. Oh, I hear what you're saying.

107
00:16:42,231 --> 00:16:45,410
Oh, here's what it should be.

108
00:16:45,411 --> 00:16:51,621
I'm not in the class, so it's always welcome, wherever it is.

109
00:16:52,191 --> 00:16:58,101
Yeah, everyone I know that's very, very difficult to do.

110
00:16:59,571 --> 00:17:03,230
Yeah, I don't want to be a consultant, so I'm on the politics.

111
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:08,361
I live the that. Yeah, but that's only a two year program, too, right?

112
00:17:08,641 --> 00:17:11,751
Yes. Yes, it is too. Yeah.

113
00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:23,221
There's actually a question we're programed to open on by taking this class.

114
00:17:23,491 --> 00:17:27,931
And that question really, really, really does recruit a lot of people.

115
00:17:28,031 --> 00:17:32,751
And I think at some point from working on my first work for.

116
00:24:43,131 --> 00:26:20,141
Yeah. And I do think women and.

117
00:26:56,451 --> 00:26:56,701
Okay.
