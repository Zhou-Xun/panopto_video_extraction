1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:07,850
Started. This is moving forward.

2
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:11,900
So today we're going to be talking about measures of disease for a lot of you.

3
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:18,290
This will all be kind of a recap of likely a valuable recap or a lot of it will be not quite all of it.

4
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:25,670
For some of you, this will be new and move very quickly. So make sure you go over this in detail because this information you're going

5
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:30,900
to need for the entire rest of the class and be able to do fairly quickly.

6
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:35,809
Most of it. I will point out the few things where like, yes, this will appear on Exam one.

7
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:40,340
You need to be familiar with the concept, but we're not going to ask you to populate it again in the future.

8
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:47,870
So a quick announcement. There are no late exams for planned absences.

9
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:51,590
I've already gotten a few requests. So what does that mean? What does that look like?

10
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:58,610
If you're going away for a wedding, if you have a conference, if you have something else like that coming up,

11
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:09,499
you get to be a beta tester for a class, which means you get to take the test early, help us kind of test out how the how the exams look looking.

12
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,560
I also have a few upper level students,

13
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:18,709
usually beta test for me just to make sure that we don't have any questions or hopefully help make sure we don't have any

14
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:25,190
questions on the exam that are going to be generally caused problems for people because of the way the question was written.

15
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:28,940
So beta testers take the exam before the exam.

16
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:33,500
They also agree to a confidentiality that they're not going to tell their classmates what was on the exam.

17
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:37,280
Okay. Obviously, if you have an emergency, come up.

18
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,839
If you're sick the day of the exam like you will then take the exam later.

19
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,100
Right. But there is no kind of planning to be away.

20
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:51,440
I've already had a few emails like that and then people are like, Actually, never mind, maybe I would change that trip, right?

21
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:57,950
So because they don't want to take the example, but there is always the option to take the exam early as a beta tester,

22
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:03,950
if you do end up taking the exam as a beta tester and there's a question we throw out,

23
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:09,260
I have a system for making sure that doesn't hurt you and in fact may help you ever so slightly,

24
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:11,750
but trying to make it as fair as possible for everybody.

25
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:23,390
So if you do need to anything around the actual exam taking, if you have any issues with it, contact Katie.

26
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:27,680
Can you check it early also for accommodations?

27
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,970
I've gotten a lot of those letters in for accommodations for the class.

28
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:38,030
If you have an accommodation and you haven't filed it for episode 601, I highly recommend you do.

29
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:45,049
So I always have a few students who don't do it. And then after Exam one say they really wish they had done it right.

30
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:48,830
So go ahead and do that. We will make sure those accommodations happen.

31
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:52,669
We do need at least a few weeks notice to do so.

32
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:59,149
So, so please get that in a.s.a.p. And if it's in the works, just let us know so we can kind of plan for it.

33
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:05,570
That would be helpful. Just a reminder, we sent out an announcement last time.

34
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:09,349
Please bring a scientific or graphing calculator to class.

35
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:12,680
Bring the calculator you are planning on using on exams.

36
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:19,640
You will not be able to use your phone or tablet computer on the on the first exam.

37
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:25,790
And I found it's very helpful for people to actually use the calculator that we're going to be using in the exam.

38
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:30,020
Okay. So that will be the last time I make that announcement.

39
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:37,760
You know, you're all adults. You get to choose what you do, but I really recommend it to help you perform as best you can.

40
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:43,460
Okay. So for today, our basic lecture outline, we're going to go over some basic concepts.

41
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:52,430
We're going to go over incidents like cumulative incidence or risk prevalence mortality measures and specific measures.

42
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:58,850
Today, I'm going to just predict we are not going to get to in fact, I will probably cut it off if we get there early.

43
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:02,299
We're not going to get to standardization, age period or cohort effects.

44
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:09,530
We will do that. That will be part of next lecture. So if you do see slides and you see like 167 slides, right?

45
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:14,810
Don't worry, I am not planning on doing all of that material in one day.

46
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:19,549
Okay? It's just for you. In the end, it's a little bit better.

47
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:22,730
It's all together rather than I split it in the middle of the lecture.

48
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:27,820
So I try to have that all, all together. All right. So epidemiology.

49
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:31,370
Oh, and we have an in-class activity today that we'll be doing.

50
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:35,839
It's all calculating risk, the four different ways that we do it in episode six.

51
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:42,200
So one, which you probably haven't seen all of these ways before, at least if you've been at Michigan because like in up in 600,

52
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:47,810
they don't have you calculated all the different ways or in any of the other classes here at least.

53
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:54,799
All right. But there is a reason to do it. And you will and you do see it all the time in few papers done in different ways.

54
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,150
And it's important to know what they're doing and what the pluses and minuses of each are.

55
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,980
All right. So epidemiologic measures, we've got frequency measures.

56
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:09,320
We have association measures, effect measures and impact measures.

57
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:17,170
Right. We're going to be talking about, you know, all association measures, effective measures, impact measures later on.

58
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:23,930
That'll be our next kind of set of lectures when we talk about measures of affect, measures of association.

59
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,830
But these are the basic measures that go into calculating this. All right.

60
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:31,819
So measures of disease are really going to be our basic measures right there.

61
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:35,389
Proportions, their rates, their ratios.

62
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:41,270
You all just go ahead. Yeah, I got all that down. I don't even need to listen to the rest of this lecture right there.

63
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:45,860
Basic measures, but there are some kind of complications around how we will calculate them for this class,

64
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:53,120
because we're doing it more exactly than you may have seen in a precisely that you may have seen in previous classes.

65
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:58,950
So proportions, right. The numerator is contained in the denominator.

66
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:04,729
There are no units that are dimensionless and that's because the same unit on the top of the bottom cancels out.

67
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:16,790
Right? It's going to be a number between zero and one and it may be multiplied by a hundred and expressed as a percent rates.

68
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:18,800
A rate is always going to include time,

69
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:26,360
although it may be implicit or explicit as to whether or not it actually says it has been a true rate measures.

70
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:34,879
Instantaneous change, something like miles per hour or every example is an incidence rate, right?

71
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,090
I will fall back on fluid because that's what I study, right?

72
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:42,860
The number of influenza cases in that cohort divided by the observation time.

73
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:52,850
So the amount of time that people are theoretically at risk for developing the disease a ratio, the numerator is not in the denominator.

74
00:06:53,720 --> 00:07:02,990
It may or may not have dimensions. For example, the number of infant deaths in one year per thousand live births in that year, that's a ratio.

75
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:11,990
Why is that a ratio? In the context of the time.

76
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:18,090
Yeah. So is every infant that died in that year. Born in that year?

77
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:22,530
Yeah. Right. So that's why it's a ratio.

78
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:29,070
Okay. So we can also do something like the proportion of women in this class with low back pain

79
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:33,509
divided by the proportion of men in this class with low back pain or to separate groups.

80
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:39,629
That would be another ratio or AP example of a ratio is going to be the odds rate,

81
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:46,230
which is the number of smokers in a room divided by the number of nonsmokers in a room.

82
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:53,699
Okay. So that's just some basic concepts background for everybody to have.

83
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:57,110
Hopefully you've seen that before. All right.

84
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:04,260
So incidence incidence is the frequency of development of a new incident case in a population over time.

85
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,290
Notice that new definition, right?

86
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:17,760
To measure incidence, people have to be followed over time and it may be expressed as a proportion or rate and we'll go through that.

87
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:25,770
So incidence density also called the incidence of rate is the number of incidents.

88
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:35,160
That is new cases of your outcome of interest divided by the total person time usually expressed as person weeks or person years.

89
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:40,080
But you can see other ways that that is expressed of the observation for the whole group.

90
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:44,610
All right. So we have the number of new cases over the top, over the person time at risk.

91
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:51,870
So when we when I told you I was going to come in early and play with this and I didn't.

92
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:59,189
Today's the first day of school for my kids. So they came in a little bit later than I would have liked just because I was

93
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:03,930
dealing with your backpacks and remembering all the items that we have to include,

94
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:10,740
etc. It's much nicer for me from there. First day of school is also the first day of classes for all of us.

95
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:14,440
Right. This year. All right.

96
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:19,180
So this little hat is just because it's an estimate.

97
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:25,270
So people always ask me that. You don't have to grovel. They're not going to get it wrong if you don't put investment.

98
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:30,790
It's just the nature that's used in some of the textbooks out there.

99
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,850
Okay. The estimate of the incidence density of this time period, 0 to 10,

100
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:41,429
is equal to the incident cases divided by person time where it's easier and cheaper.

101
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:50,290
Ever since the follow up time ize the number of cases, the approval time in PKI represents the first time it is a rate.

102
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:54,600
Units are usually cases over for some time.

103
00:09:54,610 --> 00:10:00,850
You sometimes see it expressed as one over the time or time to the negative one.

104
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:01,839
All right.

105
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:14,600
So that being said, the intensity or the incidence rate for population time contributed is limited to the time that an individual is at risk rate.

106
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:18,910
If they're not at risk to get the disease, they should not be included in it.

107
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:23,920
We don't always know, though, I will say, whether or not somebody is at risk to get a particular disease.

108
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:30,069
Individuals do not contribute population time when they already have the disease.

109
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:39,370
If you are looking at incident cases of the disease rate, if your outcome is instead mortality from this disease than if they would include,

110
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:43,180
you know, they would be included in the population time.

111
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:51,850
Often studies are going to be limited to the first occurrence of disease, but that doesn't need to be the case.

112
00:10:52,210 --> 00:11:00,730
And for, you know, infectious disease studies, for example, you know that for diseases you get once in your life, that would never be the case.

113
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:09,040
Right. For studies of asthma, that's not going to be the case. People can look at, you know, a reoccurrence for cancer.

114
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:14,260
Right. There's all kinds of things where it's not going to be limited to the for the first occurrence of disease.

115
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:21,540
Population time equivalent to person time. Yes.

116
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:27,040
Although it's a slightly broader term in a way.

117
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:38,460
So population time where we're talking about our population time, one person year could be one person followed for one year without disease.

118
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:45,420
It could be 12 people followed by one month without disease for one person for five months,

119
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:48,610
one person for four months per person for three months, all without disease.

120
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:54,090
Right. Because here we're looking at the first occurrence disease. The possibilities are really are endless.

121
00:11:54,360 --> 00:12:01,140
So one thing to really think about, what do you think? Like we treat this exactly the same, but do you think it is the same?

122
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:13,470
Would you get the same results from a study? Do you think if you enrolled a thousand people and followed them for one year,

123
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:23,520
whatever your outcome be compared to enrolling a hundred people and following them for ten years, we expect that we would get the same results.

124
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:29,010
Yeah, probably not. There are many different reasons why you would not get the same results,

125
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:34,130
including the fact probably that most diseases are age related and people are going to be aging.

126
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:40,290
But even if you could balance that out, you know, so that you have the same number of years per group,

127
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:45,650
and even if you could get rid of random error, there are other reasons why you would get different results.

128
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:50,860
But we still consider it the same.

129
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:54,290
Right. So. All right.

130
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:58,080
So for population time calculation, how are we going to talk about that?

131
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:05,549
Different ways. Method one This is when the duration is known or it can be assumed at least, right?

132
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:09,180
So population time or person time is equal to the sum.

133
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:13,350
So that's sigma there, right?

134
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:18,990
Of I equals one to this kind of in prime up here.

135
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:28,860
So over all the intervals that we have of Delta t i where delta t is the duration of observed follow up period

136
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:34,680
for the IIF individual from entry into the study until either disease detection or they withdraw from the study.

137
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:43,769
So remember, withdrawals can occur follow up loss due to migration, lack of clear up cooperation.

138
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:48,840
They might not be following your protocol. You know, they choose to withdraw and you choose to withdraw them.

139
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,749
You could get death from another course.

140
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:57,690
That's another reason why somebody would be withdrawn from your study rather than in your case, you can get termination of the study.

141
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:06,420
The funding has ended or you're doing it for whatever other reason, and then the person can also be removed from the candidate population.

142
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:14,280
An example of that would be if you're doing a study that's in a particular age range and they age out,

143
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:18,360
right, that's one reason they might move out of the study area.

144
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:22,750
That's another reason, etc.

145
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:27,210
Right. So you could be looking at premenopausal women. They go into menopause.

146
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:31,380
They would they would be removed from the candidate population for your question of interest.

147
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:42,690
So a limitation of that method is that we actually have to know the exact time of disease onset and of withdrawal, and we often don't.

148
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:51,090
All right. If you're doing a very nicely funded cohort study where you get to have this kind of continuous interaction with people,

149
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:59,280
depending on what your disease is, you might know the exact time of onset and of withdrawal.

150
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:09,600
Right. But it's more often the case that you don't know exactly when people are withdrawing or onset.

151
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:21,690
So clear. So anybody have any questions or why you might not know thought at the end of this?

152
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:29,170
Yeah. This would be a. Although, once again, sometimes we go for these free individuals that are at risk of not being there.

153
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:37,750
All right. So some some outcomes of interest, it's really evident, you know, who's at risk of developing it.

154
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:43,540
You know, for example, if your question is breast cancer in women.

155
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:48,309
Right, than men or not at risk of developing your outcome.

156
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:52,270
Right. So they're not they should not be included in the population numbers.

157
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:57,579
But for other diseases, you may not know whether somebody actually could get the disease or not.

158
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:04,659
There's always some proportion of the population that are in fact immune to the disease, even for infectious diseases.

159
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:09,100
Right. Because they don't have a particular receptor on their cells, for example.

160
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:15,100
I bet. You bet. You wouldn't necessarily know that. Usually estimates that's fairly small.

161
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:25,120
Okay. And for a limitation for withdrawal, I mean, even with cohort studies like I do a lot of cohort studies, I really like cohort studies, you know,

162
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,769
and we have one where we try to maintain really constant contact with people,

163
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:34,540
but there's some people we have contact with at least once a month right in the study.

164
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:37,990
And then there are other kids, there's like a pediatric cohort right there,

165
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:42,310
other kids that we actually only have contact with them like more or less once a year.

166
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:47,320
Right. They don't come in, they don't do these things. But then we have that kind of early contact with them.

167
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:52,330
But sometimes we go to find them and they're not at their house anymore.

168
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:55,420
The house is closed off. Other people are living there. Right.

169
00:16:55,780 --> 00:17:02,319
And so even though we're doing a cohort study where we have pretty close contact with most of the participants, not all.

170
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,979
Most. Right. We do have someone will go to look for them. We can't find them.

171
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:11,110
We have no idea where they left the last time we had contact with them. More so when they were we were at their house last year.

172
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:11,440
Right.

173
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:17,980
I know we're going to have to estimate when they withdrew from that study because we don't know exactly what had happened or maybe they came in,

174
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:21,100
you know, three months after we were at their house, but haven't come in the sense.

175
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:27,010
And so you're still kind of estimating between those two points. Okay.

176
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:32,170
So what do we do when we don't know when we have interval data for a study?

177
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:39,700
How do we calculate for some time the population time? We're going to assume that the disease occurs on one way.

178
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:46,870
This is one way. We assume that the disease occurs on the day of reporting and that withdrawal is going to be calculated

179
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:53,530
as one half the time between the last study contact and the first successful attempt at contact.

180
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:59,560
Right? So here we have person time J in prime OJ minus.

181
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:09,429
This is one half right WJ divided by two and then here delta T right so the reduce the number of withdrawals and so and that's

182
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:16,510
what you quite often do four studies different things right like you know when your cases occur depending on your disease,

183
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:23,110
right. Like I study flu over COVID, right? We know people come in and they say, I got sick.

184
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:27,970
I started feeling sick on such and such a day. Right. So we know pretty exactly when the case occurred.

185
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:35,799
But for these withdrawals, we go to their house. We haven't seen them in seven months, you know, so we're going to estimate their time in.

186
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:39,280
The study is 3.5 months since the last time we saw them.

187
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:42,520
And for that person, maybe that's not correct. Right?

188
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:49,330
Maybe they were there until like the week before or maybe they left one week after we last saw them.

189
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:55,390
Right. But then on average, if you have enough, a big enough population, it should kind of equal out.

190
00:18:55,390 --> 00:19:01,240
Right? You should get approximately the right amount of time in person, not approximately the right amount of person time.

191
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:07,240
All right. So this is when we think we know when the cases occurred, we don't know when the withdrawals are occurring.

192
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:12,970
There's another way to do this, right.

193
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:28,090
Version two, we don't know exactly when the cases occurred and we also don't know when when they through.

194
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,489
Right. And so in this particular case, well,

195
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:38,470
estimate time for both the amount of time that a case was at risk and the amount of time that a person who withdrew was at risk.

196
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:49,690
Right. So we've got our person time here. So the total population at risk minus one half of the time at risk for the people who withdrew,

197
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:57,910
minus one half of the time at risk for the people who became a case in the most of that time over here, duration of follow up.

198
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:04,930
So can anybody think of an example of when you might not know when the cases occurred?

199
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:16,260
Chronic diseases. Chronic diseases, right. You may not know exactly when the onset happened.

200
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:20,520
And a lot of people, they have a bunch of symptoms. They can't remember exactly what happened.

201
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:25,530
They go to the doctor's office. Right. And then they get diagnosed with hypertension.

202
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:28,530
Right. That's probably not the moment that their hypertension began.

203
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:37,290
People think of another example of when you would know about actually has a long wait.

204
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:43,370
Yep, exactly. Other examples.

205
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:47,030
Thinking about the diseases. We think about the investigators for a moment.

206
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:57,290
Or maybe the stage of the disease. You know, parents infections like.

207
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:03,320
Yeah. So there could be interference, infections, and maybe you go find your study.

208
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:06,860
So you're only checking once every six months or once every year.

209
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,959
He's talking about looking at antibodies.

210
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:14,590
So you look at antibodies and tell that somebody has had an infection, but you don't know when it's happened between 2030.

211
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:24,490
There are a lot of studies that are looking at, uh, you know, diseases at stages that maybe a bit preclinical, right?

212
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:33,590
Like it's not going to be necessarily apparent that you go in for an exam and at the exam date, depending on the spacing of those exams.

213
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:37,030
Right. You're going to have some time between this exam. They did not have it.

214
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:42,050
This one they did. Are those spaced your four or five years apart, etc.?

215
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:51,169
The other thing that I've actually quite often seen as people meant to ask exact questions and failed to do so in the surveys that they and then,

216
00:21:51,170 --> 00:22:01,549
you know, you do the whole study, then you start to look at the data and you go, Oh, I should have actually asked the more exact question about,

217
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:05,160
you know, it's like, did you have a heart attack this year? Yes, I did.

218
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,470
You know, instead of when what when did that hurt? Okay. When did that heart attack occur?

219
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:14,719
Right. So sometimes that's just that you you meant to you failed to ask the question, right?

220
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,900
So hopefully that doesn't happen to any of you. But there can be a lot of different reasons, right?

221
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:25,490
It can be study, design on purpose, do study design on accident and or it can be features of the disease or the outcome

222
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:29,270
that you're looking at so that you don't know exactly when it would occur.

223
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,030
All right.

224
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:41,570
So population time, if we have a steady state population or remember a steady state is the same number of people entering and leaving a population.

225
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:46,310
And those people are going to be the same in regard to age, sex, risk factors, etc.

226
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:50,300
Right. Because what we want is the same kind of proportion of people at risk.

227
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:55,820
So the same and in the same risk groups. Right.

228
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:04,850
So if you have a steady state of the population, you don't actually have to have information on individual follow up times.

229
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:13,879
Right. You can just use the size of the stable disease free population times the duration

230
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:21,890
at risk with rare diseases in prime is approximately equal to the total population.

231
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:22,639
Right.

232
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:30,110
And we use this all the time because we often don't know how many people were really at risk in Ann Arbor, Michigan, at this particular point in time.

233
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:34,669
Right. And we'll also often use the population at midpoint.

234
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:37,730
Right, if we don't know.

235
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:45,590
All right. So if we're not a steady state population, this is the midpoint thing, right?

236
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:48,980
So we know that the population numbers changed over time.

237
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,430
We're still not going to do individual we don't have individual knowledge of follow up periods.

238
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:59,659
Right. Rare disease. It's not a rare disease.

239
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:01,880
Your estimate is not going to be the best in the world. Right.

240
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:11,090
So we've got our our population time or person time is equal to once again your population.

241
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:17,480
Although this this is one half. Right. So your population at midpoint times, the duration of follow up.

242
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:27,380
Okay. So if I did something where I was looking at Ann Arbor, you know, from 2000 to 2009, I would pick the year and the midpoint, right.

243
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:35,270
Ten year period and use the population of that time because maybe Ann Arbor is growing over that entire time period.

244
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:44,510
All right. So population time summary and I'm being a little bit wordy today, I think the exact time known.

245
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:48,710
Right? That's easy. We're just going to sum up all those times. Right.

246
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,529
Then you have interval data. Right.

247
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:57,530
So we have interval data where we don't know exactly when withdrawals happen, but we know in the case what's happened.

248
00:24:57,890 --> 00:24:59,660
We're going to use this formula here.

249
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:05,719
You can have interval data where you don't know when the withdrawals happened and you don't know when the instant case was happened.

250
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:09,740
Right. You're going to use one after the time for withdrawals and the onset of cases.

251
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:17,270
So that's why we might want to have that time. You could have time not known in a steady state population right there.

252
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:24,380
We're just multiplying the population at risk times, the duration of time at risk.

253
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:30,350
Right. And then you can also have times that are not known and it's not a steady state population.

254
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:37,580
And in that case, what we usually just do is take our midpoint population and multiply it by that entire time,

255
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:44,270
even though we know that population is changing over time. Right. Maybe they grew from 10,000 people to 20,000 people.

256
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:48,620
Right. You're just going to take midpoint. All right.

257
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:56,180
So here you can kind of get used to seeing these graphs of this graph.

258
00:25:56,180 --> 00:26:01,709
These are different people. Demise, myocardial infarction or a heart attack in this particular case.

259
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:09,330
I'm going to use this graph throughout this lecture just because I, you know, used to think that,

260
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:15,090
like the more different things I use, the better you could get used to seeing like five different types of graphs.

261
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:19,080
But actually I've learned that better to teach the concepts the same thing first.

262
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:23,070
And then you can get used to seeing five different types of graphs, right?

263
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:30,959
So here we have a person who's in the study, you know, for the ten years, and then the study ends.

264
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,530
Here we have somebody having a heart attack. Heart attack.

265
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:40,109
Another person drops out right here at the end of the line right here at the year seven.

266
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:43,800
So what is the person? Time contributor will just go from person to person.

267
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:48,510
So the first person contributes ten years, right?

268
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:56,730
The next person, person number two contributes for years and then drops out the next person, right?

269
00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:03,090
Contributes nine years, sorry, four years and then has a heart attack nine years and then has a heart attack.

270
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:10,620
Then we have four years drops out, seven years has a heart attack, right?

271
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:16,080
So if you add that up, you'll get 34 person years of time.

272
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:24,690
Okay. So what about if you do this really quickly and let's say, you know, when the heart attacks occurred,

273
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:31,620
but you're only having a visit once a year and that person who dropped out showed up one year and didn't show up the next.

274
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:35,910
What would our person plan be in that case, whoever it was, 34 years this way.

275
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:43,420
What would you person time be? Number of different ways.

276
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:49,310
What are we going to do? We're going to minus one half of the person.

277
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:52,190
This is a simple example where we've only got one person.

278
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:58,490
So this person now, before we thought it was four years, but now we lost them somewhere between three and four.

279
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:03,260
Right. We're going to say they contributed 3.5 years so that you already knew it was 34.

280
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:10,880
You just minus five, right. Because you're subtracting out how many are for that individual and we get 33.5 years.

281
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:15,379
All right. What about if we also don't know when the heart attacks occurred?

282
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:20,780
Because, remember, this was the question where you asked if you had a heart attack in the last year, you forgot to ask what it was.

283
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:26,360
What would we do then? Yeah.

284
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:29,959
We would take that away half a year because or half a time period.

285
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:34,610
Right. But this happens to be one year time periods for tax write for each of these.

286
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:40,309
So that's going to be we're going to subtract out another 1.5 years, right.

287
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:43,930
So that plus the 0.5 for the person we lost is minus two.

288
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:51,400
So you end up with 32 years. So there we go.

289
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:55,660
All right. So let's do a quick practice.

290
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:59,230
Right? Calculate incidence. I'll let you guys read this for yourselves.

291
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:50,749
And then when you're finished off, you generally kind of make some sort of eye contact with me.

292
00:30:50,750 --> 00:31:53,210
I start to judge when most of the classes that. Yep.

293
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:58,690
So people who I don't tell you dropped out or something happened to them made it through the whole thing.

294
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:05,500
And I try to be as specific as possible. Right. I tell you, it's like the first day of day of year eight, right?

295
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:15,820
I just said you're a you would you could assume one of two or multiple different things.

296
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:45,690
All righty. All right. So we're calculating incidence, right?

297
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:51,219
So how many how many cases did we have? 83.

298
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:59,410
Right. So we know that goes on the top. So that that is pretty straight forward right now.

299
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:07,320
We've got 325. So that's the people who all the people in the study, right.

300
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:14,120
-25 because they didn't contribute the entire amount of time that you can write this absolutely differently if you want this.

301
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:17,280
I did it -83, which is the number of cases. Right.

302
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:23,450
So those individuals are the people who were in the study for the entire time did not develop our disease.

303
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:28,990
They did not about. Right. We're just going to multiply it by the 17 years that the study ran.

304
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:34,480
Then we've got 25,000 people.

305
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:39,280
These are the people who withdrew. We don't know when they withdrew. So we do 8.5 years.

306
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:43,630
Right. This is that one half of that time period then.

307
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:50,650
So we're adding that time back, right. One half of their time plus 83 times seven.

308
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:57,760
Right. Why is that seven. Because they both developed disease on the first day of year eight.

309
00:33:57,850 --> 00:34:03,560
Yeah. So they develop disease on the first day of year eight. So they're not at risk from that first day of year eight.

310
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:13,980
Right. So they were at the last day of year seven. All right, so we do that and that's what you get.

311
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:18,430
So then you get .00001563.

312
00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:22,220
You could write it that way, not the best way to.

313
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:35,830
And, you know, it's not that easy to interpret. So we usually will rise to the 1.6, but that's supposed to be 1.6, not six per 100,000 person years.

314
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:44,930
So apologies there. Right.

315
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:49,280
But you could you could choose something else. Usually we kind of rounded up.

316
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:56,750
So you get a whole whole number of a number to start writing, but also say 16 person per 1 million person years.

317
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:01,310
All right. Can you make a note or change that on the slides?

318
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:04,550
Version nine. All right. Measures.

319
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:16,520
So hazard rate measures, instantaneous mortality or disease risk relative to the survival probability just s t there so has a rate is instantaneous,

320
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:20,089
whereas an incidence density is an average rate.

321
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:26,860
It's over the time period. Right. Um, this has some issues when used as a measure for causal inference.

322
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:29,960
Um, and we'll discuss that later in the course.

323
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:38,560
All right. So here's some survival curves, right, and hazard functions here.

324
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:47,090
Here we can see the hazard functions for males and females, but survival curve, usually everybody starts right alive or without the disease.

325
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:50,980
And then you see this increase over time. Um.

326
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:58,170
So I guess mortality in California. 1980.

327
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:04,259
All right. So. So you may see hazard rates pop up.

328
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:10,410
We'll talk about hazard rates more later on, but that's one that's about cumulative incidence risk.

329
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:15,430
So there are different methods to estimate risk, right?

330
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:21,270
We've got simple, cumulative. For those of you who've taken an acting class before, I would.

331
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:26,380
I would. That you encapsulated risk using the simple cumulative method.

332
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:32,770
There's the actuarial or life tables method, and there is the density method,

333
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:36,850
and then there's the product limit method and we will go through all of those

334
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:40,969
methods and you should be able to calculate risk using all of those methods.

335
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:44,860
So we have an activity to practice doing that. All right.

336
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:54,610
So the simple cumulative method, right, is the risk in this time period is equal to the cumulative incidence during that time period.

337
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:59,500
The little heart here, once again is just for the estimated incidence.

338
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:06,910
So here we have the incident cases divided by the number of disease free subjects at t zero.

339
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:13,030
Right? So everybody who was in your study or your population is just for it.

340
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:17,560
Now these cases are divided by disease free persons to zero.

341
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:24,080
So some of the things about the simple cumulative method, right?

342
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:27,980
It assumes that all subjects are observed for the entire time period.

343
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:34,580
May not be true, but that's the assumption you're making since there's no competing risks.

344
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:39,229
That means that people are not. If you're looking at death as an outcome or a really any outcome,

345
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:43,250
nobody's going to die of any other cause because they're going to stay for the entire time.

346
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:50,990
And these requirements are frequently unrealistic, but work if you're doing something in a really time limited space.

347
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:55,310
Right. So when would this work?

348
00:37:55,740 --> 00:38:01,310
You know, when this works perfectly. The Diamond Princess, does anybody remember the diamond princess?

349
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:10,879
So you're like, yeah. So was the cruise ship right? When they took the first cruise ship that got a lot of COVID cases and then are getting docked.

350
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:18,440
Right. People did leave the ship to go to the hospital, generally speaking, you know, or after a certain time period of waiting.

351
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:22,309
But it was a short time period. Right.

352
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:25,340
And we were able and everybody was kind of a captive audience.

353
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:32,000
They couldn't go anywhere. So you were able to watch everybody over that time period, over that entire time period.

354
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:37,000
So there are certain circumstances where simple equivalent, those assumptions, you're actually meeting them.

355
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:38,809
There are other circumstances where you're not meeting them,

356
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:44,420
but you're going to kind of acknowledge that and just kind of acknowledge that the restaurant is not perfect.

357
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:48,980
But there you go. All right. So simple, cumulative method.

358
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:52,429
We're going to go back here.

359
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:55,520
We've got a similar graph. Not exactly the same one.

360
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:59,510
An X here is a new or incidence occurrence current of disease.

361
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:09,500
The zeros here are deaths that occur. Thus the the solid line is somebody who's living with that disease over whether or not they're at risk of.

362
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:16,050
Case. And the dashed line is somebody with a.

363
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:21,020
We got the disease. All right.

364
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:28,310
So the simple cumulative incidence for this is we take the number of people who are disease free at the start.

365
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,600
Right. So we're going to get one, two, three, four, five.

366
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:37,550
We're not counting person three and six because they're not disease free at the start of the study.

367
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:40,339
All right, so that's five.

368
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:49,370
So that's our population, that's disease free at the start and that risk and then we're going to divide it by the number of cases one,

369
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:55,759
two, three, those little access that occur in those people who were disease free at the start of the study.

370
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,960
So three over four, which equals 0.6, which equals 60%.

371
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:09,470
So that's the simple cumulative method. So in terms of this measure, I guess the measure of risk is the time.

372
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:16,430
The time dimension is inherent. So yeah, you would say over a five year period.

373
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:25,430
Obviously it's not super exact when we're doing it this way and we'll do it like on the example, we'll have another example very similar to this.

374
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:31,430
You'll walk through it, you'll see how the amount the risk varies depending on which which method you use and how.

375
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:33,440
Some of them are probably more exact than others. Right?

376
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:43,829
But yeah, you should also always for cumulative incidence, you should always say the time period that you're talking about,

377
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:47,550
you know, over ten years, over five years, over one month, whatever it is.

378
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:52,770
Okay, so we've got it here. We're going to calculate cumulative incidence and incidence density.

379
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:58,320
This will be on do it on your own for a moment in class.

380
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:07,179
Okay. So what is our cumulative incidence here? What are we dividing by?

381
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:13,600
What? How many cases do we have of breast cancer?

382
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:20,230
60. 60. Right. And we're going to divide that by 40,000 women.

383
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:23,740
Right. That's our sample. And we're assuming everybody's at risk the whole time.

384
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:29,760
So we would say it's 0.0015 over five months.

385
00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:34,390
That's our risk. All right. Remember, there is that that time period that we want to see out there.

386
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:38,900
What about incidence? That's the question.

387
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:43,000
So what do you say over five months? Are you assuming that there.

388
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:52,990
For almost five months. All six. So yes, what I'm saying they were observed for five months.

389
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:59,030
Just assume that if I don't tell you. So here we've said that everybody's been observed for five months.

390
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:03,739
There are 60 cases. And I just we haven't made it easy for you.

391
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:09,320
I had them all happen on the same day because it allows you to calculate it more quickly.

392
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:14,389
Right. And for instance, density, obviously, per capita incidence, it doesn't matter.

393
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:18,920
But yes, if I tell you cases per hour for a four, but I tell you,

394
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:23,480
everybody was observed for that time period, assuming you've been given all the information there.

395
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:29,420
And if you're not sure, that's all right.

396
00:43:29,480 --> 00:44:52,220
So incidence, density. All right.

397
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:56,720
So for the incidence density, we have the same number of cases, right? It's going to be 60 cases.

398
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:02,000
Then we've got 39,940 women.

399
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:07,610
Right. Plus the 40,000 -60 that contributed the entire five months of time.

400
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:11,300
And we have 60 women who contributed one month of time.

401
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:16,750
We're going to add that person time together. Right.

402
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:22,940
And that is what we get. So we get 0.0003 cases per person per month.

403
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:32,239
And you don't here have to say over a five month period, because that's not what we necessarily do for incidence density.

404
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:39,649
Although, as I said before, you can debate whether or not watching 40,000 women for five months is the same as a smaller

405
00:45:39,650 --> 00:45:44,000
number of women for a longer time period where you get the same amount of person time.

406
00:45:46,790 --> 00:45:50,450
All right. So that would be 3.6 cases per thousand person years.

407
00:45:52,800 --> 00:46:04,410
All right? Yes. The first the exact number of cases.

408
00:46:05,970 --> 00:46:12,940
Years. Does it matter? It's like if you're trying to suppress one person months, it's just one month for.

409
00:46:18,370 --> 00:46:24,580
You like as a person concerned that you see that sometimes?

410
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:31,840
I just didn't do that here. You kind of like feel most of the time as an investigator, you do what makes the most sense.

411
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:37,450
Usually in assignments, I think we don't tell you what to do.

412
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:44,340
We had a little bit of an inkling and we really rather we all do the same thing because it makes it much easier.

413
00:46:44,350 --> 00:46:51,339
So we will tell you quite often how we want that it's for us or we'll get some

414
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:56,710
sort of explanation at the beginning of the entire journey for you to do it.

415
00:46:56,980 --> 00:47:00,250
If you miss that and you tell me slightly differently, it's not like.

416
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:06,250
One person per person year instead of 400,000 this year.

417
00:47:06,770 --> 00:47:14,260
Right. It would be like a moment. All of us have lost weight.

418
00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:18,379
So that's not I mean, I want you to follow instructions, but that's not really what we care about.

419
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:24,020
We care about eventually understanding practice. But in practice, it's like, what makes the most sense?

420
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:29,450
Like for me, what really bothers me which like if you work in infectious diseases like I do,

421
00:47:29,450 --> 00:47:36,409
I hate person seasons for some reason because it's like anyways, so the exact exactly of what the season looks like.

422
00:47:36,410 --> 00:47:39,570
But you see all the time you see them in the papers, right?

423
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:42,979
And they're just like we just followed people, we started following people.

424
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:49,820
Once we saw flu hit a certain point and once it dropped below a certain level, then we would stop people.

425
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:59,320
And you. Seasons. So for like for influenza, which I studied most of the time, you see it reported per 100 person years,

426
00:47:59,330 --> 00:48:02,510
I would say that's the most common you also see per person season.

427
00:48:03,230 --> 00:48:09,410
But you know, for dengue fever, it's usually per 1000 person years because it's a little bit less common.

428
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:17,140
So yeah, it will just completely be based on how your study is designed in part,

429
00:48:17,150 --> 00:48:24,200
and then kind of what is the norm, what makes sense in your field and given the results from reporting.

430
00:48:28,410 --> 00:48:38,700
Okay. So with that, we are going to take a ten minute break and start back up at 11:00,

431
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:42,720
but we're going to start back up at 11:00 with the starting the in-class activity.

432
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:51,150
So if you could stay your seat for just a second, we'll hand those out and then we could take a break.

433
00:49:37,416 --> 00:49:40,926
All right, we're going to get started. Sorry. I get started back up.

434
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:48,216
Right. So this is six individuals, right? To in three pieces of disease.

435
00:49:48,486 --> 00:49:54,036
So three divided by 6.5 or 50% over a six year time period.

436
00:49:54,836 --> 00:49:58,706
So she'd been pretty quick to do.

437
00:49:58,836 --> 00:50:04,176
Okay. So we're going to go on to method number two, which is the actuarial method.

438
00:50:05,586 --> 00:50:09,786
So the estimated risk, which is estimated to be a lot of incidents,

439
00:50:10,296 --> 00:50:18,486
is equal to the instrument cases over the disease free population at the start, minus one half of the withdrawals.

440
00:50:19,746 --> 00:50:26,546
So what are we assuming here? We don't actually know.

441
00:50:27,926 --> 00:50:31,556
Yeah. So we don't know the withdrawal signs. But what are we assuming about the withdrawals?

442
00:50:33,646 --> 00:50:38,216
Yeah, kind of. On average, they're occurring halfway through. That may not be correct.

443
00:50:38,216 --> 00:50:46,136
Right. Or something. Like if you looked at the Ann Arbor population and we're looking at like an only, we're following people over here starting now.

444
00:50:46,796 --> 00:50:53,546
Right. And we follow them forward. Do you think people that leave this population on average would leave it leave it halfway through the year?

445
00:50:54,686 --> 00:50:59,786
No. Right. Because we have a ton of students and people who tend to leave at the end of the academic year.

446
00:51:00,116 --> 00:51:04,765
Right. On average, they're leaving the population. So you could also have a catastrophe happen.

447
00:51:04,766 --> 00:51:10,946
All sorts of things could happen that like it's not actually happening, that it's constant in one half year, but that's what we're assuming.

448
00:51:11,366 --> 00:51:15,776
So we're assuming a continuous rate of withdrawals throughout the study period.

449
00:51:16,586 --> 00:51:21,206
That's also often not true in studies. When do you usually lose the most people in studies?

450
00:51:21,806 --> 00:51:29,466
Things a little bit on the studies, but cohort studies often you lose the most people in the first year actually for withdrawals.

451
00:51:29,486 --> 00:51:34,106
Like not following protocol, stuff like that. People kind of commit to it and then don't do it.

452
00:51:34,106 --> 00:51:40,286
You sometimes lose people later like I'm more losing more people in my Sars-Cov2 study now than

453
00:51:40,286 --> 00:51:44,486
I did in the beginning because everybody was so jazzed up about doing it for the first year,

454
00:51:44,846 --> 00:51:49,376
right? Then the vaccines came out and people were like, Yeah, you know?

455
00:51:49,376 --> 00:51:54,356
I mean, you know, I don't know if I want to keep coming in and doing all this, which is totally understandable, right?

456
00:51:55,196 --> 00:52:01,645
So we lost some people and then that rate of loss started slowing down a ton because then

457
00:52:01,646 --> 00:52:05,246
all the variables started picking up and all this other stuff started happening and people,

458
00:52:05,606 --> 00:52:10,916
you know, kind of then were more excited again about participating in the study.

459
00:52:11,486 --> 00:52:15,475
So you can also do things throughout your study too. Like you're like, Oh, we're losing too many people.

460
00:52:15,476 --> 00:52:21,926
How can we like engage more, right? So you might not have a constant rate of loss, but you would actually know what you're missing.

461
00:52:22,316 --> 00:52:33,296
Okay. So actuarial method to estimate the risk for extended time period to zero to T.J. for Delta years.

462
00:52:33,656 --> 00:52:38,576
Right. We combined the one year estimates of risk over that time period.

463
00:52:38,926 --> 00:52:51,516
Um, so here CIJ is the delta j your cumulative incidence for the age or at the time interval right from this time?

464
00:52:51,536 --> 00:52:54,836
J Minus one to time. J And uh.

465
00:52:55,976 --> 00:52:58,916
J Prime is a dummy subscript for the j stratum.

466
00:53:00,036 --> 00:53:08,666
And this allows us to accumulate time from the beginning of the first age interval to the end of the j age interval or time interval.

467
00:53:09,446 --> 00:53:20,276
And there's a, you know, the distinction between delta T, which is calendar time and Delta, which is age or H intervals.

468
00:53:24,146 --> 00:53:30,356
Okay. So the actual method uses light tables to observe data, to estimate risk.

469
00:53:30,836 --> 00:53:36,506
It relies on calculating the probabilities of each strata and then calculating the cumulative probability.

470
00:53:37,436 --> 00:53:40,886
The Q And you're going to calculate the cumulative probability of survival.

471
00:53:40,886 --> 00:53:48,206
So probability that during the first interval times, the probability the second interview will control probability.

472
00:53:48,836 --> 00:54:02,516
Third interview Well, and then you are going to calculate risk by taking one minus the probability of survival for the effect of population size.

473
00:54:02,516 --> 00:54:06,896
We're going to use disease free of charge, minus one half of the withdrawals.

474
00:54:08,636 --> 00:54:13,495
So we'll go through step by step what that looks like here for calculating a life table.

475
00:54:13,496 --> 00:54:20,756
But once again, the steps are one calculate the effect of population size to calculate the proportion who die.

476
00:54:21,176 --> 00:54:27,476
In three, we're going to calculate the proportion who survived. Then we're going to calculate the total survival proportion.

477
00:54:27,926 --> 00:54:33,056
And then we're going to calculate risk by taking one minus the collective survival proportion.

478
00:54:34,946 --> 00:54:39,536
Okay, so we've got this like table here. It's got five intervals of five years.

479
00:54:40,046 --> 00:54:43,796
Right here is the population of the population.

480
00:54:43,946 --> 00:54:50,006
So that interval we've got the number of people who die during the interval and then the number of people who live through.

481
00:54:54,226 --> 00:54:58,006
The effect of population size. That's the first thing we're going to calculate, right,

482
00:54:58,006 --> 00:55:05,086
is the people who are live at that that first time point in your interval, minus one half of those in the group.

483
00:55:06,316 --> 00:55:10,486
So we can go through that right for the first interval. Right.

484
00:55:10,516 --> 00:55:14,206
It's 375 minus one half of zero zero.

485
00:55:14,446 --> 00:55:16,546
So, you know, 50, 75. Right.

486
00:55:16,546 --> 00:55:30,406
For the second interval, though, we take 197 minus one half of 43, which is going to be, what, 21.5 and we end up with one 75.5.

487
00:55:31,576 --> 00:55:37,336
Doing that really quickly in my head, that makes sense. There have been errors in this, but I think we've ironed out all the errors in these tables,

488
00:55:39,466 --> 00:55:48,166
etc. and you're going to go ahead and go down and calculate that out for the effect the population within each interval that we're looking at.

489
00:55:49,606 --> 00:55:52,726
Then we're going to calculate the proportion who died. Right.

490
00:55:53,116 --> 00:55:55,396
And those are that is the number of people who died,

491
00:55:55,966 --> 00:56:02,026
because we're looking at mortality here right after this like table divided by the effect of population size.

492
00:56:03,256 --> 00:56:08,716
So here for the first one, we have 178 people who died.

493
00:56:08,956 --> 00:56:13,666
We're going to divide that by 375 and we end up with 0.75.

494
00:56:14,146 --> 00:56:20,986
Right. Then here we have 83 people who died divided by one, 75.5.

495
00:56:21,316 --> 00:56:25,576
We end up with 2.4, seven, three, etc.

496
00:56:25,876 --> 00:56:30,136
I'm going to go through each step and calculate that out. You'll get to practice this.

497
00:56:30,136 --> 00:56:36,376
So. All right. Then we calculate the proportion who survived.

498
00:56:36,736 --> 00:56:40,996
Remember, that's just going to be the proportion. One minus the proportion who died.

499
00:56:41,416 --> 00:56:43,276
It's going to give you the proportion who survived.

500
00:56:45,016 --> 00:56:54,526
So one minus point four, seven five gives you .5251 -2.4, seven three gives you point five, two, seven, etc.

501
00:56:57,226 --> 00:57:06,456
Then we calculate the cumulative survival proportion rate, which is the proportion that survived year one times, the proportion who survived year two.

502
00:57:06,486 --> 00:57:10,326
That's going to be our tools of the survival proportion to the second time period.

503
00:57:10,866 --> 00:57:17,916
Right. So here you see what the survival proportion is, just the survival proportion in the first time period.

504
00:57:18,306 --> 00:57:28,266
But for the second time period, it's going to be 0.5 to 5 times, 4.5 to 7.2, seven and seven for the third one.

505
00:57:28,276 --> 00:57:33,726
We're going to multiply these three together to get the cumulative survival proportion.

506
00:57:35,256 --> 00:57:46,026
And down at the bottom. This tells us that the survival over that time period, which is 12.4%.

507
00:57:50,866 --> 00:58:02,716
Sorry. So the humans of survival proportion is just multiplying out the proportion who survived in one time period,

508
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:07,236
like in the time periods until the end for what you're looking at.

509
00:58:07,246 --> 00:58:17,206
Right. So if you're looking at this interval, it would be point 5 to 5 times 25 to 7 times .6985.763.

510
00:58:18,806 --> 00:58:22,526
Okay to give you the cumulative survival that if you're doing here, of course,

511
00:58:22,856 --> 00:58:29,166
that number for the second at the end of the second year, it will be point 5 to 5 times 5 to 10.

512
00:58:34,386 --> 00:58:39,125
All right. So our cumulative survival is 12.4. But remember, we are interested in risk here.

513
00:58:39,126 --> 00:58:45,216
That's what we're wanting to calculate. So we're going to take the cumulative risk is equal to one minus the cumulative survival.

514
00:58:45,936 --> 00:58:54,936
So that's one -0.12 for just 0.876 or the cumulative risk is 87.6%.

515
00:58:57,036 --> 00:59:02,556
One thing that, you know, you see happening all the time and people struggle with is like, why are we happy?

516
00:59:02,556 --> 00:59:08,345
That's why we want to point out the cumulative survival. Well, think about the cumulative risk here.

517
00:59:08,346 --> 00:59:11,826
Right. If you multiply opportunities, the risk is a continuous.

518
00:59:13,936 --> 00:59:18,136
Right. We'll play out the rest. We get to the contenders. That's why we converted.

519
00:59:19,336 --> 00:59:21,496
There's also going to it and print it out.

520
00:59:21,526 --> 00:59:28,036
But if you just think about logically, it wouldn't make sense to multiply out the can of the rest to get to the cumulative rest.

521
00:59:28,786 --> 00:59:38,516
Yet we see it all the time. Right. Yes, you see.

522
00:59:40,526 --> 00:59:53,136
So we'll go to the Kaplan-Meier method. All right.

523
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:58,796
So you can do this and you get life expectancy. Tables, for example, are done done this way.

524
00:59:58,826 --> 01:00:02,566
This is life expectancy of just, you know, from 2016.

525
01:00:06,296 --> 01:00:10,526
I should probably put the newest numbers up. It actually takes quite a while, though, for all that up.

526
01:00:11,186 --> 01:00:15,655
Um, and you know, people should know are probably not, you know,

527
01:00:15,656 --> 01:00:23,696
that the life expectancy in most countries declined during the first year of the stars could be to pandemic.

528
01:00:24,176 --> 01:00:27,505
Another time that you saw a time like that was 1918 pandemic.

529
01:00:27,506 --> 01:00:30,746
There was a massive decline in life expectancy over that time.

530
01:00:32,096 --> 01:00:34,766
So here we have life expectancy in 2020.

531
01:00:35,036 --> 01:00:43,976
So just showing that the first wave really resulted in a decrease in life expectancy for each racial group here.

532
01:00:49,106 --> 01:00:51,505
And just to point out that, of course,

533
01:00:51,506 --> 01:00:59,786
there was inequality and life expectancy decline during the first year of the pandemic because that's what those data has come from.

534
01:00:59,786 --> 01:01:05,906
But over the entire course of the pandemic, to date, there's still inequality and life expectancy decline.

535
01:01:10,146 --> 01:01:15,326
Okay. So that is the actuarial method.

536
01:01:15,336 --> 01:01:19,656
You know, I'm going to go through do the second method and have you guys work on.

537
01:01:21,006 --> 01:01:27,306
Both are all three at the same time, maybe all three. Okay. So risk density method, this is method number three, right?

538
01:01:27,306 --> 01:01:30,906
It's based on the estimation of the average rate, the incidence density.

539
01:01:32,916 --> 01:01:37,146
It's helpful to kind of think of a closed cohort with a constant incidence rate.

540
01:01:37,686 --> 01:01:42,626
Right? So we've got one minus in five G,

541
01:01:42,636 --> 01:01:50,915
which is the expected number of individuals who are disease free at 20 divided by the number of disease free individuals cert,

542
01:01:50,916 --> 01:02:00,066
which equals to one minus exponentially minus incidence density times that that delta, the interval period.

543
01:02:00,366 --> 01:02:05,196
Okay. And this is really the formula you need to remember here.

544
01:02:06,756 --> 01:02:12,606
So Delta here could be Delta could be Delta T, so it could be an H interval.

545
01:02:12,606 --> 01:02:15,646
It could be a time interval. Right on.

546
01:02:18,906 --> 01:02:25,056
So for the density method, for constant incidence density, the relationship between Delta and R,

547
01:02:25,416 --> 01:02:32,166
which is the risk to the direct relationship between time or the age interval, right in R is exponential.

548
01:02:32,166 --> 01:02:37,086
It's not going to be linear, thus that the one year risk is 10%.

549
01:02:37,596 --> 01:02:41,196
The five year risk is not going to be 50%. Okay?

550
01:02:41,196 --> 01:02:47,046
So that's something that's important to remember. And the risk can never be greater than one, right?

551
01:02:47,436 --> 01:02:54,366
This goes from 0 to 1. So the 20 year risk in this particular case would be a percentage.

552
01:02:54,366 --> 01:02:58,146
It wouldn't be going to be 100% or greater.

553
01:02:58,656 --> 01:03:05,856
Okay. So this is just to show that graphically right here, we've got a population of here.

554
01:03:05,856 --> 01:03:09,366
We've got a constant risk over time or age.

555
01:03:09,876 --> 01:03:13,356
Right. And you can see that it's exponential. It is not linear.

556
01:03:17,246 --> 01:03:26,406
I guess. You know what? Actually, the. So an example for the risk density method.

557
01:03:26,436 --> 01:03:33,665
We're going to go back to that same example again. Right. And we've got incidence density, but all over the total time periods,

558
01:03:33,666 --> 01:03:43,056
0 to 5 is three because we have three cases and we had 13 years of time at risk here.

559
01:03:44,496 --> 01:03:52,866
So we'll get 0.2314 for a year as our incidence density.

560
01:03:54,486 --> 01:04:05,376
So the risk over this time period, it's going to be one minus exponential -0.231 times five that five as there is because this

561
01:04:05,376 --> 01:04:10,986
is per year and we've got a five year time period where there's five years of follow up time,

562
01:04:12,306 --> 01:04:18,996
you end up with 0.685 or 68.5%.

563
01:04:20,106 --> 01:04:23,856
Do you all see that when we get the time and we sure do. You want me to go through that?

564
01:04:24,906 --> 01:04:27,446
This person, at which time it was number one out,

565
01:04:27,636 --> 01:04:34,796
it's actually got the side little cheated on the side here but five years, right this person has two half years, etc.

566
01:04:35,196 --> 01:04:35,426
Right.

567
01:04:35,436 --> 01:04:47,996
So it's the amount of time that was represented by that that dashed the languages, the time that they are at risk of developing the disease, you know.

568
01:04:48,066 --> 01:04:54,816
So there are some issues with the density method and you can do a time stratified density method to get around some of these issues.

569
01:04:54,816 --> 01:05:01,626
Right. So one of the issues, of course, is typically that the incidence rate for most diseases varies over time on age and

570
01:05:02,796 --> 01:05:07,206
you can just divide it down into intervals right into a time stratified method.

571
01:05:09,486 --> 01:05:15,036
So the constant rate assumption doesn't hold, particularly if you're looking at longer intervals.

572
01:05:17,526 --> 01:05:20,766
Which is why you want to see the small the. Okay.

573
01:05:21,126 --> 01:05:24,546
So what does that look like for the time stratified density method?

574
01:05:24,906 --> 01:05:32,406
Right now, we're just going to some saying that they were just summing over the different strata here.

575
01:05:33,066 --> 01:05:36,006
Right. So we once again estimating the risk of disease.

576
01:05:36,006 --> 01:05:48,486
It's going to be one minus exponential and now the sum of the incidence density over each time period or or interval times.

577
01:05:48,816 --> 01:06:03,796
Dr. J. So this method can be used to look at the amount of risk between any given two times to permit them to spend one time.

578
01:06:03,796 --> 01:06:07,106
Zero up to time. Three or four. Right.

579
01:06:10,036 --> 01:06:14,776
So our stratified risk density will go back to our same example.

580
01:06:15,496 --> 01:06:20,416
To put it into place, we have incidence.

581
01:06:20,416 --> 01:06:25,486
Density of over the first time period is one over 4.5.

582
01:06:26,506 --> 01:06:29,536
Why is that? Are we. How are we populating that?

583
01:06:30,176 --> 01:06:35,726
I remember we're just looking now at our first time period here to make it easy.

584
01:06:35,746 --> 01:06:39,006
Right. So we have one case that occurs at the end of that time period.

585
01:06:39,016 --> 01:06:42,406
That's where that one comes from. And then we're going to add up.

586
01:06:45,266 --> 01:06:50,966
The amount of time for everybody there. All right.

587
01:06:52,916 --> 01:07:02,846
So what we'll do is we just go through and we calculate the incidence intensity for each time, interval for each stratum.

588
01:07:04,476 --> 01:07:10,466
Okay. So the first one is 0.22. For the second one, no cases occur.

589
01:07:10,526 --> 01:07:19,666
Right. And we've got 3.5 years. I like to keep the peace just for a moment that I apologize.

590
01:07:20,716 --> 01:07:23,595
And then you're going to keep kind of going through that, right? Sort.

591
01:07:23,596 --> 01:07:30,796
So like you talked about the number of in some cases that occur, we have three in total and the amount of person time in each of these intervals.

592
01:07:30,796 --> 01:07:36,426
We do have some intervals where no cases occur right in the incidence.

593
01:07:36,436 --> 01:07:45,776
Density in those intervals is zero. All right, then we're going to take we're going to do the summation of those.

594
01:07:45,776 --> 01:07:47,716
So for the first one, right,

595
01:07:48,196 --> 01:08:06,286
it's 0.1998 because we've got one minus exponential it -0.22 now times one because it's a one year interval that we're looking at equals 0.1994.

596
01:08:06,286 --> 01:08:09,345
The second one. Right. We're going to do that individually.

597
01:08:09,346 --> 01:08:14,415
Two So one minus exponential of -0 times one, which gives us zero.

598
01:08:14,416 --> 01:08:17,806
You can just put zeros across for cases that occur in the strata,

599
01:08:17,806 --> 01:08:29,536
but you are supposed to put the whole thing into the table, etc. Then we can calculate the risk in any given time period.

600
01:08:29,866 --> 01:08:31,786
So here in this particular example,

601
01:08:32,596 --> 01:08:39,346
I didn't do a variance for 0 to 2 because that would be the same as the risk in one and will be very helpful to you.

602
01:08:39,996 --> 01:08:50,086
So we're going to do 0 to 3. So we've got these individual risks for each time period and sorry, individual incidence densities for each time period.

603
01:08:50,356 --> 01:08:54,556
So we're going to put those into this formula. We're going to sum them up, right?

604
01:08:54,556 --> 01:09:01,606
And then take the the exponent of that and we get 0.463.

605
01:09:04,216 --> 01:09:10,005
And that would be the risk from for the first three intervals and you can do it over the entire time interval.

606
01:09:10,006 --> 01:09:13,995
And you could see that we're getting a slightly different answer right than we got with the risk.

607
01:09:13,996 --> 01:09:17,096
Last time was last time eight something.

608
01:09:17,716 --> 01:09:25,186
Right now we're a .0. 7 to 4. Okay.

609
01:09:26,116 --> 01:09:30,916
You can also have examples such as this one.

610
01:09:31,576 --> 01:09:36,786
Now we've got your period. So 35 to 39, 42, 44.

611
01:09:36,796 --> 01:09:41,595
So these are age groups, right? So each person is going to spend a certain amount of time in the age group, right.

612
01:09:41,596 --> 01:09:46,126
And then move on to the next. This population has been followed for three years.

613
01:09:47,356 --> 01:09:50,446
Here the five. And here is for that interval.

614
01:09:50,596 --> 01:09:52,996
Right. So there people are spending five years.

615
01:09:53,206 --> 01:10:00,255
One thing I would note is if you printed up the older version or looking at the older version of these slides, I had an error there.

616
01:10:00,256 --> 01:10:04,276
I spent 35 to 40. Right. It should have been 35, 39.

617
01:10:04,486 --> 01:10:07,666
And that actually copied its way through the slides here.

618
01:10:10,096 --> 01:10:13,296
If it was really 35 to 40, we'd have six there. Right.

619
01:10:13,306 --> 01:10:21,766
But it isn't. All right. So here we can do it for that age bracket, you know, 40 to 44.

620
01:10:22,336 --> 01:10:32,056
Right. Same thing. We've got the incidence rate and then we'll calculate the five year risk for that 40 to 44 year old age bracket.

621
01:10:33,726 --> 01:10:38,736
And once again, this performance at 40 to 45 now is fixed online.

622
01:10:39,486 --> 01:10:41,706
How many people actually print up the site at this point?

623
01:10:46,316 --> 01:10:50,036
Seriously, I'm not even going to raise my hand now because I'm the only person in the classroom principal.

624
01:10:50,366 --> 01:10:57,835
So many people aren't printing them up. It is actually quite helpful rather than just taking notes because I knew pretty quickly to have the slides.

625
01:10:57,836 --> 01:11:02,096
I see a lot of you though, are taking notes on your computers or have the slides in front of you.

626
01:11:02,756 --> 01:11:16,386
I will say that you probably all remember this. Physically writing things out has been shown to be much more useful than just looking at it.

627
01:11:16,776 --> 01:11:17,046
Right.

628
01:11:17,046 --> 01:11:27,386
So adding on to the slides or even, you know, taking your own notes on the side, just saying what's important, you will get much more out of this.

629
01:11:27,426 --> 01:11:31,506
Last time I got to spend less time outside of this class to watch material.

630
01:11:33,496 --> 01:11:41,656
Once again, probably you all know that. But I see a lot of people just kind of walking, looking at it and not actually writing anything down.

631
01:11:44,356 --> 01:11:53,116
Okay. So assumptions of the density method, each age specific incidence rate, incidence density is constant over the entire interval.

632
01:11:53,356 --> 01:11:57,376
That's one thing that we're assuming. This, of course, is not biologically plausible.

633
01:11:57,646 --> 01:12:05,386
If I tell you that something increases with age, it's not like he goes 40, 44 here, and then it goes from 45 to 49.

634
01:12:05,386 --> 01:12:08,925
So right. Or probably increasing over that entire time period.

635
01:12:08,926 --> 01:12:13,516
But that's not you know, we're assuming, in fact, that it's constant over that interval.

636
01:12:14,266 --> 01:12:19,006
Each age specific rate incidence density is constant over calendar time.

637
01:12:20,866 --> 01:12:24,586
Probably also not true, but that's another assumption that we're making.

638
01:12:27,076 --> 01:12:32,836
And we're assuming that the incidence rate when observations are made is the same as it was for that age group in the past.

639
01:12:33,316 --> 01:12:38,036
Sometimes that's decades earlier and that there are no secular trends.

640
01:12:38,056 --> 01:12:45,376
And so that's what we're assuming by assuming that each age the second rate or its intensity is constant over time.

641
01:12:46,486 --> 01:12:53,416
So just things to be aware of. So I for the, for the first example,

642
01:12:53,416 --> 01:13:04,876
when we did the stratified stratified by time we did that because we're assuming that the incidence changes over each each time period.

643
01:13:04,886 --> 01:13:08,866
Yeah. All right.

644
01:13:09,826 --> 01:13:13,306
So incidents that A why are we.

645
01:13:14,356 --> 01:13:19,726
Why are we looking at survival? So survival is treated as compounded phenomenon.

646
01:13:20,146 --> 01:13:24,616
The probability of survival at time. One is the probability of surviving through time one.

647
01:13:25,576 --> 01:13:31,876
And it's kind of a mathematical explanation of why you would look at risk, where we're looking at survival.

648
01:13:33,346 --> 01:13:36,825
And one of the reasons is the probability of dying at time.

649
01:13:36,826 --> 01:13:41,036
One at a time, zero. Makes no sense. It's not biologically possible right.

650
01:13:41,146 --> 01:13:46,786
To do so. So anyways, there you go.

651
01:13:51,696 --> 01:13:58,356
1128. Let's go ahead and work on the in-class activity.

652
01:13:58,366 --> 01:14:05,196
I was thinking about holding off and doing the whole thing at the end, so I'm a little bit worried about the methods getting mixed together.

653
01:14:05,946 --> 01:14:11,255
So don't do the question that asked you to do it via the Kaplan-Meier method,

654
01:14:11,256 --> 01:14:19,476
but work up through there for the next two questions and we'll go ahead and take 10 minutes to work on that.

655
01:14:34,526 --> 01:14:40,706
Television, but also the.

656
01:14:46,396 --> 01:14:55,666
Well. Yeah.

657
01:14:59,486 --> 01:15:12,666
All right. Well, first. And.

658
01:15:15,666 --> 01:15:20,576
It's hard. Given.

659
01:15:22,526 --> 01:15:37,736
Yes. So the other thing about during in class activities, if you have a question, just raise your hand, make eye contact motion.

660
01:15:37,746 --> 01:16:41,176
One of us will come over and agitate. Question. Which.

661
01:16:44,946 --> 01:16:50,126
No meetings to actually conduct this.

662
01:17:14,826 --> 01:17:36,106
Thank you so much. Okay. Sorry.

663
01:18:49,923 --> 01:18:59,993
So one of the things we're doing across activities, the in-class activity, the answers will automatically release at at the end of lecture.

664
01:18:59,993 --> 01:19:04,533
It's set up to do that. Try not to look at the answers until you've finished working through the problems.

665
01:19:05,283 --> 01:19:09,252
If I don't see a lot of people making eye contact with me, but it's kind of.

666
01:19:09,253 --> 01:19:09,853
It's kind of.

667
01:19:10,093 --> 01:19:17,893
We kind of need to move on giving away the lecture that I won't go over it because, you know, it's not useful for everybody at that at that time.

668
01:19:20,593 --> 01:19:24,103
All right. So we've gone through three methods of calculating this.

669
01:19:24,853 --> 01:19:31,513
We've got one more, which is the Kaplan-Meier method for the following method.

670
01:19:34,123 --> 01:19:45,193
So here. All right, we have the risk is equal to the cumulative incidence rate, which is the incidence the j over in the population at risk.

671
01:19:46,063 --> 01:19:50,623
So you're going to be calculating the risk of each at the time that each case occurs.

672
01:19:50,983 --> 01:19:55,753
So one of the big differences between this and the the two prior methods that we just worked on.

673
01:19:56,713 --> 01:20:05,173
So it avoids the limitation of having to categorize follow up time into intervals and which is what we did in the life table and the density methods.

674
01:20:05,713 --> 01:20:09,373
Also, withdrawal happens at the time that a case occurs.

675
01:20:11,533 --> 01:20:16,663
This is really the best way to estimate risk if the time of the cases is now.

676
01:20:18,853 --> 01:20:26,293
All right. So we're going to begin by ordering all subjects for my follow up time.

677
01:20:26,953 --> 01:20:32,623
Right. So here, obviously, they're not ordered by their follow up time for the amount of time that they were followed up.

678
01:20:32,623 --> 01:20:37,783
So this person is going to be our first person. Right. Because they were only followed up 4.5 years.

679
01:20:38,323 --> 01:20:47,023
Right. For half a year. So we're ordering people up into those by the amount of time that they were at risk.

680
01:20:47,773 --> 01:20:51,313
Right. So then we have our population at risk by four, 3 to 1.

681
01:20:51,313 --> 01:20:56,043
And then here we have our cases all withdraws the zero.

682
01:20:56,053 --> 01:21:01,453
There is just somebody with Peru. Right. So really you're counting up cases where we have some lines that are occurring because people withdraw.

683
01:21:05,413 --> 01:21:17,112
All right. So to do this for the first time interval we've got, our conditional risk is one right over five.

684
01:21:17,113 --> 01:21:23,013
So we end up with 0.20. We don't really need to do a cumulative survival here.

685
01:21:23,023 --> 01:21:27,102
We could write we've got our key letter for a 6.20.

686
01:21:27,103 --> 01:21:31,932
That's what we're interested in. Just because it's the first first interval.

687
01:21:31,933 --> 01:21:38,913
Right? So you could do that for each time period here.

688
01:21:39,463 --> 01:21:44,133
Right. So we've got our conditional risk. We don't have to calculate anything for these people.

689
01:21:44,133 --> 01:21:50,953
You could actually even leave them off, but then you get a little bit mixed up some better to put them on a roll.

690
01:21:50,973 --> 01:21:55,413
We there's no risk in that time period because people were through, but nobody nobody became a case.

691
01:21:57,063 --> 01:22:01,532
So here we've got our conditional risk of each time period.

692
01:22:01,533 --> 01:22:06,512
So this 2.5 right here or at each time point.

693
01:22:06,513 --> 01:22:09,663
Sorry. To qualify right here.

694
01:22:09,663 --> 01:22:17,883
One person developed disease. We have three for the population at risk and 1.3 to 3, etc.

695
01:22:20,523 --> 01:22:25,143
And then the rest is actually going to be calculated the same way as what you do in the actual method.

696
01:22:25,143 --> 01:22:28,113
It's just that first step that's different where we just calculate,

697
01:22:28,123 --> 01:22:33,903
we're just basing it on when the stuff happens rather than representing each each time interval.

698
01:22:34,863 --> 01:22:41,033
So we've got our cumulative survival is equal to one minus the cumulative this.

699
01:22:41,883 --> 01:22:50,102
So here this is just looking at that time period or the sorry that this is not cumulative from this is the survival in that time

700
01:22:50,103 --> 01:22:58,263
interval in case of j minus one occasion of just that one time interval is equal to one minus the risk in that time interval.

701
01:22:58,863 --> 01:23:10,593
So here we've got interval s 2.4.9.3, 2.51 -0.333, which is equal to 0.667.

702
01:23:13,863 --> 01:23:21,843
All right. And then we're going to do this summation of survival like we did in the last method.

703
01:23:24,213 --> 01:23:34,863
So here right at this 2.5, the risk up until that time point we get one minus the cumulative survival here,

704
01:23:36,183 --> 01:23:44,373
which is 0.800 times the cumulative survival here, which is 0.667.

705
01:23:45,333 --> 01:23:53,913
So equals 0.466. And I think I said some a second ago and I really meant to say the product, so obviously, uh, sorry.

706
01:23:56,383 --> 01:24:00,283
The symbol is the product, not some. Okay.

707
01:24:06,133 --> 01:24:09,342
So the big difference here is how we're lining up people.

708
01:24:09,343 --> 01:24:12,313
We're only looking at when events occur, right?

709
01:24:12,313 --> 01:24:20,893
We're not going to represent each individual interval, even if nobody drops out and and nobody develops a disease of interest.

710
01:24:21,463 --> 01:24:27,053
But the rest of it is actually done the same way. Okay.

711
01:24:27,053 --> 01:24:31,223
So that's the Kaplan-Meier method. So which method for risk, which method should you use?

712
01:24:31,823 --> 01:24:33,532
It's really going to depend on your data. Right.

713
01:24:33,533 --> 01:24:38,602
The sample collection is when you have complete follow up, then that's going to be the best, easiest method to use.

714
01:24:38,603 --> 01:24:43,983
Right? Sometimes you only have information to support criminal justice.

715
01:24:44,393 --> 01:24:49,463
That would be another reason for the actuarial. We'll do it when we have incomplete follow up.

716
01:24:50,483 --> 01:24:54,983
So data on cases and withdrawal are limited to interval periods.

717
01:24:55,523 --> 01:25:04,703
Right. Then actual it is going to be your choice, the density method or incidence density to compare to the incidence its preferred when the

718
01:25:04,703 --> 01:25:11,602
exact time of alongside a withdrawal is known and it's used when only rate data are available.

719
01:25:11,603 --> 01:25:16,672
If I'm only giving you the incidence densities, right, you can calculate the risk off of that.

720
01:25:16,673 --> 01:25:18,923
But this is going to be the only method for you to do so.

721
01:25:19,943 --> 01:25:26,453
The product limit or the kaplan-meier will be used with incomplete follow up exact data available for the cases.

722
01:25:26,663 --> 01:25:32,183
But data on withdrawal is limited to the time periods and your kaplan-meier is going to be your best form.

723
01:25:35,393 --> 01:25:42,233
So since we only have 5 minutes in the interest of time, we're not going to do the last part of this activity, right?

724
01:25:42,233 --> 01:25:46,583
Please, please do it at home and we have office hours to go.

725
01:25:46,613 --> 01:25:51,593
But if any questions about whether or not we release at the end of class with the answers on it.

726
01:25:52,493 --> 01:25:59,153
So risk or rate risk measures answer whether an event occurs over a given time period,

727
01:26:00,113 --> 01:26:05,272
risks to be used to make causal inferences when dealing with acute diseases and exposures that

728
01:26:05,273 --> 01:26:12,113
are fixed or in short duration rate is going to give an answer like when an event occurs.

729
01:26:13,343 --> 01:26:17,783
Generally used for causal inferences regarding the occurrence of chronic or repeated

730
01:26:17,783 --> 01:26:24,503
romantic diseases are based on race because exposure statuses can change over time.

731
01:26:24,843 --> 01:26:31,463
You're not going to actually ever typically observe the entire risk period for disease, right?

732
01:26:34,253 --> 01:26:37,463
The relationship between risk and incidence rate.

733
01:26:37,853 --> 01:26:43,973
We've seen this explicitly in in calculating risk.

734
01:26:44,123 --> 01:26:49,853
Right. One minus the explanation, a negative incidence density times are delta there.

735
01:26:50,423 --> 01:26:54,173
So the simplistic view of this is really that risk is equal to your incidence rate.

736
01:26:54,203 --> 01:27:07,523
Times, time. Okay. That's only true though, if risk is low and the time period is short and the incidence rate is constant over time.

737
01:27:09,653 --> 01:27:16,483
And you should remember that risk is dimensionless and incidence density has units of negative time.

738
01:27:16,523 --> 01:27:28,553
Right? So when is it true that the risk is approximately equal to the incidence rate times the time be a short time period.

739
01:27:28,973 --> 01:27:32,602
Right. So if you're looking at like a one year risk period for most diseases,

740
01:27:32,603 --> 01:27:40,233
which are relatively rare events for a rare disease, the risk is impacts are really going to be one times the rate.

741
01:27:40,253 --> 01:27:46,103
Right. But the further you get away from that, the the more different.

742
01:27:46,103 --> 01:27:50,573
Okay. And so here you can see here is the risk percent.

743
01:27:50,573 --> 01:27:54,443
This is the number of years of follow up. Right. And this over here.

744
01:27:54,473 --> 01:27:58,343
These are rates which are same concept in this example. Okay.

745
01:27:58,883 --> 01:28:05,423
And here you can see it's pretty linear, right, when it's a rare disease, even over long periods of time.

746
01:28:06,413 --> 01:28:11,182
But of course, that is not true when it is not as rare with disease.

747
01:28:11,183 --> 01:28:15,653
And of course, it gets less and less true the further. The longer time interval.

748
01:28:19,573 --> 01:28:25,723
So risk value is less than 10 to 20% of the relationship is approximately in your.

749
01:28:30,653 --> 01:28:34,043
In summary risk versus rate.

750
01:28:34,883 --> 01:28:38,153
Are risk or measures going to be cumulative incidence?

751
01:28:38,723 --> 01:28:46,943
It is dimensionless but must refer to the time period under study because it doesn't help me very much if I tell you what the risk is.

752
01:28:47,183 --> 01:28:50,923
But you don't know if that's a one year risk or a ten year risk or one of the risk.

753
01:28:50,933 --> 01:28:56,843
Right. Looking at very different things there, the range is going to be from zero 0 to 1.

754
01:28:58,763 --> 01:29:02,933
And so for a rate, we've got our incidence density and our hazard rate.

755
01:29:02,993 --> 01:29:06,592
Those are the two rates that we we talked about today.

756
01:29:06,593 --> 01:29:09,803
We're really going to concentrate in on incidence density in this class.

757
01:29:10,343 --> 01:29:19,133
Right. The dimension is one over time, the cases per person time and you can go from zero to infinity for rates.

758
01:29:23,613 --> 01:29:33,603
All right. And so with that, we're up to prevalence and we're going to cut off here for today because it is 1149 and I will see you on Thursday.
