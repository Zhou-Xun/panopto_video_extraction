00:00:10,357 --> 00:00:11,815
Hi, this is Matt Zawistowski.

2
00:00:11,815 --> 00:00:16,319
In this lecture, we're going to discuss
sources of correlated outcomes.

3
00:00:16,319 --> 00:00:19,582
Let's start by talking about why
it's important to know if you do

4
00:00:19,582 --> 00:00:23,490
have correlated outcomes in your data.

5
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:28,020
If you think back to prior statistics
courses, you might remember that you often

6
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:32,299
made assumptions about the data for
the statistical models you plan to use.

7
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:36,502
For example, we often make assumptions
about the distribution of the data.

8
00:00:36,502 --> 00:00:40,051
In standard linear regression we
assume that the residuals are normally

9
00:00:40,051 --> 00:00:40,814
distributed.

10
00:00:40,814 --> 00:00:45,931
And for logistic regression we assume the
outcomes follow a binomial distribution.

11
00:00:45,931 --> 00:00:50,010
If assumptions for a model are violated,
the model might not be valid, and

12
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,490
any inference based on
the model could be wrong.

13
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:58,302
Another common assumption is that
outcomes are independent or uncorrelated.

14
00:00:58,302 --> 00:01:02,235
This means that knowing the value of one
outcome measurement gives no information

15
00:01:02,235 --> 00:01:06,440
about other measurements in the dataset.

16
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:10,795
As an example, consider this simple
dataset consisting of sex, age, and

17
00:01:10,795 --> 00:01:14,670
BMI collected on different people.

18
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:18,382
The data on each sample is independent,
if, for example,

19
00:01:18,382 --> 00:01:23,659
knowing subject 005's BMI gives me no
information about the BMI measurement for

20
00:01:23,659 --> 00:01:26,470
other samples in the dataset.

21
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:30,101
Independence is an assumption for
many common statistical methods,

22
00:01:30,101 --> 00:01:32,132
particularly linear regression, and

23
00:01:32,132 --> 00:01:37,690
the reason it is critical to understand
the concept of correlated data.

24
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:40,120
So what causes correlated data?

25
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,250
It can happen in a variety of ways.

26
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:47,877
Sometimes it is intentional,
an investigator might specifically collect

27
00:01:47,877 --> 00:01:52,446
correlated data as a way to increase
the statistical power of their study.

28
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:56,680
For example, if we want to know the
effectiveness of a medical intervention,

29
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:01,172
we might intentionally take measurements
on the same set of individuals before and

30
00:02:01,172 --> 00:02:03,540
after the intervention.

31
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,895
Sometimes the correlation is not
intentional or is unavoidable.

32
00:02:07,895 --> 00:02:10,839
Even though we do not intend for
the correlation,

33
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:14,283
it must be identified and
accounted for during analysis.

34
00:02:14,283 --> 00:02:19,577
Examples here include genetic studies that
intend to recruit unrelated individuals,

35
00:02:19,577 --> 00:02:24,530
but inadvertently recruits related
individuals from the same family.

36
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:26,943
Or imagine a dental
study of tooth erosion,

37
00:02:26,943 --> 00:02:30,402
the erosion of teeth within
a person's mouth are correlated,

38
00:02:30,402 --> 00:02:35,100
because those teeth are all
exposed to the same environment.

39
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:39,234
Let's consider some common
sources of correlation in data.

40
00:02:39,234 --> 00:02:41,421
The first type is clustered data.

41
00:02:41,421 --> 00:02:45,779
In this situation, the samples in
the dataset belong to distinct groups or

42
00:02:45,779 --> 00:02:50,554
clusters, and samples in the same cluster
are more likely to have similar outcome

43
00:02:50,554 --> 00:02:52,170
measurements.

44
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:56,512
We can think of these clusters as
circles that create distinct subsets

45
00:02:56,512 --> 00:02:58,506
of individuals in the dataset.

46
00:02:58,506 --> 00:03:01,496
The cluster could correspond
to family members or

47
00:03:01,496 --> 00:03:05,564
individuals who attend the same school or
work at the same company.

48
00:03:05,564 --> 00:03:09,584
The key point is that individuals who
belong to the same cluster are more

49
00:03:09,584 --> 00:03:10,991
likely to have similar or

50
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:15,760
correlated outcomes compared to
individuals from different clusters.

51
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,466
Often we're not even interested in
the effect of the cluster itself.

52
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:22,749
It's not an exposure of interest,
but we want to account for

53
00:03:22,749 --> 00:03:25,650
the correlation it creates.

54
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:30,490
Another common type of
correlation is hierarchical data.

55
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:33,923
In this type of data there
are multiple levels of clustering.

56
00:03:33,923 --> 00:03:38,520
Pictorially, hierarchical clustering
results in tree-like structure.

57
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:42,240
A great example of this is
medical outcomes for patients.

58
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,933
Patient outcomes are usually
not independent, but

59
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:49,658
rather depend on where and
from whom they receive medical care.

60
00:03:49,658 --> 00:03:53,089
Patients see specific doctors
at specific hospitals,

61
00:03:53,089 --> 00:03:57,080
creating a hierarchy of
correlation among outcomes.

62
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:01,536
Two patients treated by the same doctor
will often have more similar outcomes than

63
00:04:01,536 --> 00:04:04,490
two patients seeing different doctors.

64
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:08,202
If two patients see different doctors but
go to the same hospital,

65
00:04:08,202 --> 00:04:13,450
they might have more similar outcomes
than patients at two different hospitals.

66
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:17,952
Again, we might not be interested in the
treatment effect of any specific doctor or

67
00:04:17,952 --> 00:04:18,788
hospital, but

68
00:04:18,788 --> 00:04:24,530
the correlation introduced by this
hierarchy is important to consider.

69
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:28,778
A third common source of correlation
is due to the collection of repeated

70
00:04:28,778 --> 00:04:30,920
measures data.

71
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:34,430
This is the situation in which
an investigator collects multiple

72
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:38,630
measurements of the same variable
on the same set of individuals.

73
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:43,031
In the simplest case, there are two
measurements on each study participant.

74
00:04:43,031 --> 00:04:47,042
For example, the weights of individuals
before and after a new diet, or

75
00:04:47,042 --> 00:04:50,726
blood pressure measurements for
a set of hypertensives before and

76
00:04:50,726 --> 00:04:53,830
after starting a new prescription drug.

77
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,830
These are often called paired data,

78
00:04:55,830 --> 00:05:00,270
which you may have previously
encountered with the paired t-test.

79
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,212
More generally,

80
00:05:01,212 --> 00:05:05,418
repeated measures data can have more than
two measurements of the outcome, and

81
00:05:05,418 --> 00:05:11,090
can be taken under different treatments or
conditions or taken overtime.

82
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:15,706
When the repeated measure data is taken
over time, it is called longitudinal data.

83
00:05:15,706 --> 00:05:18,675
This refers to the temporal
collection of the outcome, so

84
00:05:18,675 --> 00:05:21,166
that the measurements
have a natural ordering.

85
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:25,639
For example in the figure, measurements of
the outcome are taken at different months,

86
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:28,359
so that we are able to put
the measurements in order and

87
00:05:28,359 --> 00:05:32,260
observe change in the outcome over time.

88
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:36,370
As with other types of correlated data,
it is often the case that outcomes

89
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:41,550
within a subject are more similar than
outcomes between different subjects.

90
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:46,257
As in this example, the outcomes for
Subject 1, represented by the blue dots,

91
00:05:46,257 --> 00:05:50,276
are more similar than comparing
measurements between Subject 1 and

92
00:05:50,276 --> 00:05:52,580
Subject 2.

93
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:56,724
Determining if correlation exists in
your dataset is an important step before

94
00:05:56,724 --> 00:06:00,120
beginning your statistical analysis.

95
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,663
Ignoring correlation would violate
the independence assumption of many common

96
00:06:04,663 --> 00:06:08,690
statistical methods,
rendering the results invalid.

97
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:12,065
An important skill therefore
is being able to look at data,

98
00:06:12,065 --> 00:06:17,460
like the example shown here, and recognize
the potential source of correlation.

99
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:22,880
Here we see that multiple BMI measurements
are taken on the same individuals.

100
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,864
Even though the individuals
themselves might be independent,

101
00:06:26,864 --> 00:06:30,713
BMI measurements within the same
individual likely are not.

102
00:06:30,713 --> 00:06:34,552
A proper statistical analysis
of correlated data begins with

103
00:06:34,552 --> 00:06:40,210
this key first step of identifying
the source of the correlation.

104
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:40,887
In summary,

105
00:06:40,887 --> 00:06:45,510
many statistical methods include
independence among their assumptions.

106
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:50,291
Analyzing datasets containing correlated
outcomes, be it by design or by accident,

107
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:53,480
would violate the independence assumption.

108
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:57,845
Longitudinal study designs intentionally
collect correlated data by

109
00:06:57,845 --> 00:07:01,563
measuring the same variable
over time on the same subjects.

110
00:07:01,563 --> 00:07:06,709
This is the type of data we will
learn how to analyze in this course.
