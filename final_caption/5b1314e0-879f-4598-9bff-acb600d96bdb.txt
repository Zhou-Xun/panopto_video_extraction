1
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:12,250
In this module, I'll be giving you
an overview of how we might go about

2
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:16,518
evaluating the impacts of environmental
health policy on human health.

3
00:00:16,518 --> 00:00:19,610
And I'm going to encourage you to
pause your video for a moment and

4
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:23,980
think about the kinds of information you
would want to have in order to assess

5
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:28,070
whether a particular policy is actually
changing public health for the better.

6
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:31,650
Or if it's not improving public health,
meaning it's not working.

7
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,442
You can probably very rapidly come up with
a lot of different kinds of information.

8
00:00:35,442 --> 00:00:39,280
I'm going to give you an overview of some
of the types of approaches we can take

9
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,440
to answer that very question.

10
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:46,090
So in this module, we're going to focus
on three main types of evaluation.

11
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:48,810
The first is an environmental
impact assessment,

12
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:52,290
which as you might imagine
focuses on the environment.

13
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:54,740
The second is a health impact assessment,

14
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,560
which focuses on the biological
aspects of human health.

15
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,960
And the third is a benefit-cost analysis,

16
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,080
which typically focuses on
the economic aspects of human health.

17
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,820
So you may intuitively grasp this,
but each of these provides a different

18
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:13,360
perspective on the impacts of changes
to the environment on health.

19
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,610
And those changes could
result from a policy, or

20
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:19,620
they could result from a development or
a project.

21
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,880
Looking more into environmental
impact assessments, or

22
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,270
IES as I'll say,
these are triggered by the requirements of

23
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:30,341
the National Environmental Policy Act
passed by Congress in 1969.

24
00:01:30,341 --> 00:01:35,155
And the EIA is basically a process that
reviews the environmental consequences of

25
00:01:35,155 --> 00:01:37,818
anthropogenic or human driven activities.

26
00:01:37,818 --> 00:01:40,918
So it's going to look at
the impact of the project or

27
00:01:40,918 --> 00:01:45,089
change on the health of the environment,
on ecological health.

28
00:01:45,089 --> 00:01:48,561
And on changes to nature services,
in other words goods and

29
00:01:48,561 --> 00:01:53,430
services that humans benefit from
that are provided by natural systems.

30
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:57,590
Now the focus in an EIA, or
Environmental Impact Assessment,

31
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:01,210
is primarily on analyzing the quality
of environmental media, so

32
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:04,740
how contaminated are air,
or water, or soil.

33
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,400
Also includes a landscape and
geological and

34
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:13,240
climatological analysis, and
lastly an ecological analysis.

35
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:17,100
So the EIA is a multi-step process
that we're going to walk through now.

36
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:20,869
I will say for
all of these three approaches,

37
00:02:20,869 --> 00:02:25,830
EIA, HIA, and BCA,
it's critical that stakeholders

38
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:30,120
who could potentially be
affected be engaged at all steps.

39
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:35,680
So the first of six steps in Environmental
Impact Assessment, EIA, is screening.

40
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,750
And basically, this is looking at
the project or policy change and

41
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:42,680
asking what elements of this
assessment are actually needed?

42
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,260
The second step is scoping, which is
to identify what are the potentially

43
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:51,140
significant issues that could
arise from this policy or project.

44
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:54,750
The third step is assessment, and
there's actually five sub steps here.

45
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,050
The first subset is need.

46
00:02:56,050 --> 00:03:01,456
We need to identify what is the need
that's driving this policy or project.

47
00:03:01,456 --> 00:03:06,172
The second are they proposed
characteristics of the policy or project.

48
00:03:06,172 --> 00:03:08,690
Third is doing an analysis
of alternatives.

49
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:13,170
So if we didn't do this policy or project,
what are the alternatives we could do or

50
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:14,930
that might happen?

51
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:19,200
Fourth is a baseline analysis, so
what are the conditions right now?

52
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,060
And fifth is an impact analysis.

53
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:26,200
How do we expect conditions to
change with this policy or project?

54
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,590
The fourth step is management and
monitoring.

55
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:32,040
So how are we going to identify
impacts from this project?

56
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,185
How are we going to monitor them and
how will we mitigate them if they arise?

57
00:03:36,185 --> 00:03:38,518
The fifth step is a synthesis statement.

58
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:40,782
So how does all of this information and

59
00:03:40,782 --> 00:03:44,552
predictive knowledge that we've
put together fit together?

60
00:03:44,552 --> 00:03:47,223
And the sixth and
last step is review and decision making.

61
00:03:47,223 --> 00:03:51,226
So considering all the information and
all these inputs, can and

62
00:03:51,226 --> 00:03:56,940
should the project or policy move forward
or is it not worth the potential risk?

63
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,528
So I'd like to give you some
examples of metrics and

64
00:03:59,528 --> 00:04:01,525
indicators that we might use in an EIA.

65
00:04:01,525 --> 00:04:06,739
These are going to focus primarily on
changes or impacts, for example on soil.

66
00:04:06,739 --> 00:04:10,615
So is there going to be a change in
contamination levels in the soil or

67
00:04:10,615 --> 00:04:14,924
a change with the soils compliance
with certain regulatory standards?

68
00:04:14,924 --> 00:04:19,940
Those same approaches apply for
air pollution and water pollution as well.

69
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:22,360
There's also considerations
of ecologically status.

70
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:27,243
So are we going to impact endangered or
vulnerable species or on the flip side,

71
00:04:27,243 --> 00:04:29,468
are we going to impact pest species?

72
00:04:29,468 --> 00:04:32,470
And lastly,
we might look at geological hazards.

73
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:36,307
So the image you see here should give you
an idea of how these things fit together.

74
00:04:36,307 --> 00:04:40,394
So we can identify different
consequences for different metrics.

75
00:04:40,394 --> 00:04:44,265
So what's the risk that an endangered
species will be impacted?

76
00:04:44,265 --> 00:04:47,510
What's the risk that we're going to
harm a national heritage site?

77
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:50,550
What's the risk of an impact on wetlands,
or marine environments,

78
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:51,890
or other water sources?

79
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:55,520
So we can assign these things
probability based on what we know.

80
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,085
And then collectively across
all these metrics and

81
00:04:58,085 --> 00:05:02,091
indicators we can ask ourselves, should
this project or policy move forward?

82
00:05:02,091 --> 00:05:04,321
Or again, is it too hazardous and

83
00:05:04,321 --> 00:05:09,990
the benefits are not going to be worth the
potential gains from this particular act?

84
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:12,672
Next is a health impact assessment,
or HIA.

85
00:05:12,672 --> 00:05:16,210
As I mentioned, this was
developed from EIA strategy and so

86
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:18,770
it's very similar in appearance.

87
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:23,457
And basically this is the process for
describing an estimating the effects of

88
00:05:23,457 --> 00:05:26,425
a project or
policy on human population health.

89
00:05:26,425 --> 00:05:29,837
The idea here is we want to provide
practical recommendations that

90
00:05:29,837 --> 00:05:32,255
are going to minimize
negative health effects,

91
00:05:32,255 --> 00:05:37,320
but also very importantly maximize
beneficial health effects.

92
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,949
So as I said, the steps here
are similar but not identical.

93
00:05:39,949 --> 00:05:43,573
The first of five steps
in an HIA is screening.

94
00:05:43,573 --> 00:05:47,620
So we quickly want to establish how
relevant to human health is this policy or

95
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,207
project?

96
00:05:48,207 --> 00:05:51,667
Do we even need to do a full HIA?

97
00:05:51,667 --> 00:05:53,526
The second step is scoping.

98
00:05:53,526 --> 00:05:56,350
So this is going to be the identification
of key health issues and

99
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,556
public health concerns.

100
00:05:57,556 --> 00:06:01,572
And we're also going to set boundaries
about what we're considering and

101
00:06:01,572 --> 00:06:03,589
what's outside of our assessment.

102
00:06:03,589 --> 00:06:05,439
The third step is appraisal.

103
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:07,909
And this could involve
either a very rapid or

104
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:12,938
conversely a slower in-depth assessment of
health impacts using available evidence.

105
00:06:12,938 --> 00:06:14,691
Whether it's rapid or in-depth,

106
00:06:14,691 --> 00:06:17,502
we definitely want to answer
who's going to be effected?

107
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,776
What are the baseline conditions?

108
00:06:19,776 --> 00:06:23,662
What are the predicted conditions
after the policy or project?

109
00:06:23,662 --> 00:06:26,863
What's the significance of this policy or
project to human health?

110
00:06:26,863 --> 00:06:30,559
And how would we mitigate
any adverse impacts?

111
00:06:30,559 --> 00:06:32,300
The fourth step is reporting.

112
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,470
So here we want to draw conclusions and
make recommendations

113
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:40,210
about how we might remove or mitigate
any of the negative impacts on health or

114
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:43,640
how we can enhance those positive impacts.

115
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,540
And the fifth and
final step is monitoring.

116
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:50,150
So here we want to take action to
monitor the actual observed impacts on

117
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:56,100
human health and that's going to further
build our existing evidence base.

118
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,950
I'd like to give you some examples
now of certain metrics and

119
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:04,020
indicators that we might use doing
an HIA for environmental health.

120
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:07,246
So the graph on the left
actually illustrates for

121
00:07:07,246 --> 00:07:12,359
us the anticipated changes in health in
terms of avoided premature deaths and

122
00:07:12,359 --> 00:07:17,565
avoided years of life lost that might
happen if we were to change the PM 2.5.

123
00:07:17,565 --> 00:07:20,305
This is a particular
type of air pollution,

124
00:07:20,305 --> 00:07:25,650
in Wayne County where Detroit is located,
from 10 to 8 micrograms per meter cube.

125
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:30,681
So basically a 20% improvement or
reduction in air pollution levels.

126
00:07:30,681 --> 00:07:34,526
And you can see in this case we've
got things broken out by age group on

127
00:07:34,526 --> 00:07:35,333
the x-axis.

128
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:39,885
What we can see is, if we were to reduce
air pollution by 20% we'd see net

129
00:07:39,885 --> 00:07:44,948
benefits in terms of avoided years of life
lost and avoided premature deaths across

130
00:07:44,948 --> 00:07:49,604
all age groups, but that the impacts
are not equal across those age groups.

131
00:07:49,604 --> 00:07:51,549
So that's one way we can look at impacts.

132
00:07:51,549 --> 00:07:56,567
We can also consider the impact on or
changes in for example incidents and

133
00:07:56,567 --> 00:08:01,007
prevalence counts or rates,
excuse me, or counts of disease,

134
00:08:01,007 --> 00:08:05,222
again years of life lost or
disability adjusted life years.

135
00:08:05,222 --> 00:08:09,254
We could look at At the number of
hospitalizations, the number of visits to

136
00:08:09,254 --> 00:08:13,734
emergency departments, or the incidence
and count of injuries, for example, so

137
00:08:13,734 --> 00:08:17,430
all measures of human illness or
health impacts.

138
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,610
There's other things we
can look at as well.

139
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:24,100
Not just health outcomes, but we could
talk about changes in health disparities.

140
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:27,203
In other words, the equal opportunity for
health among all.

141
00:08:27,203 --> 00:08:31,566
And in this case we might have a special
focus on the impacts among vulnerable or

142
00:08:31,566 --> 00:08:33,099
high-risk populations.

143
00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:35,218
We could also have as metrics or

144
00:08:35,218 --> 00:08:40,115
indicators changes in health behavior
in the population of interest.

145
00:08:40,115 --> 00:08:42,963
Lastly, I want to talk about
benefit-cost analysis.

146
00:08:42,963 --> 00:08:47,849
So as an example, there was a study
published in the 1990s that tried

147
00:08:47,849 --> 00:08:52,734
to put a price tag on the direct cost
of all of the environmental safety and

148
00:08:52,734 --> 00:08:55,637
health regulations in the United States.

149
00:08:55,637 --> 00:08:59,077
And estimated that all of those
regulations together cost,

150
00:08:59,077 --> 00:09:03,732
at that time, around $200 billion per
year, or roughly the equivalent of all

151
00:09:03,732 --> 00:09:08,750
domestic non-defense discretionary
spending by the US government that year.

152
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:09,650
So that's a lot of money.

153
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:13,721
Of course, it's our job in public health
to try to figure out what are the benefits

154
00:09:13,721 --> 00:09:15,205
of all of those regulations.

155
00:09:15,205 --> 00:09:17,838
There are many ways to approach
a benefit-cost analysis.

156
00:09:17,838 --> 00:09:22,039
The Environmental Protection Agency, or
EPA, has done so in a number of their

157
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:26,270
standards that they've passed
to protect community health.

158
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:29,728
So for example,
EPA passed a drinking water standard for

159
00:09:29,728 --> 00:09:31,969
a chemical called trihalomethane.

160
00:09:31,969 --> 00:09:36,810
And because many many people
are exposed to trihalomethane,

161
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:40,438
the cost per life saved
was relatively small,

162
00:09:40,438 --> 00:09:46,228
in this case about $200,000 spent for
every human life we saved.

163
00:09:46,228 --> 00:09:50,986
On the other hand, the EPA has also
passed a listing of what certain wood

164
00:09:50,986 --> 00:09:53,934
preserving chemicals as hazardous waste.

165
00:09:53,934 --> 00:09:58,856
And they've estimated that the cost to
save a single life with that particular

166
00:09:58,856 --> 00:10:02,074
regulation was more like
$11 million per life.

167
00:10:02,074 --> 00:10:06,252
So here again, we could try to figure out
if we want to spend our limited public

168
00:10:06,252 --> 00:10:10,562
health dollars, let's try to spend them
in a way that's maximizing the number

169
00:10:10,562 --> 00:10:13,680
of lives saved or
health preserved compared to the cost.

170
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,902
So applying benefit cost analysis broadly
could allow us to reallocate priorities.

171
00:10:18,902 --> 00:10:23,220
We're going to save more lives at
a given cost level or maybe we can save

172
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:29,050
more lives at a lower cost by regulating
a different contaminant or risk.

173
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:33,340
So there are a number of recommendations
on how we should employ BCA appropriately.

174
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:36,600
So first, this really is a useful tool for

175
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,870
comparing favorable versus
unfavorable effects of policy.

176
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:44,060
Second, agencies really
should be allowed to consider

177
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:48,430
economic factors when they
set their regulatory agendas.

178
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:53,503
Third, we really should require BCA for
all major regulatory decisions.

179
00:10:53,503 --> 00:10:58,171
But fourth, when we use that,
agencies should not be bound by strict

180
00:10:58,171 --> 00:11:02,369
benefit cost analysis tests or
certain specified criteria.

181
00:11:02,369 --> 00:11:06,367
A few more recommendations, the best
benefit cost estimates are accompanied by

182
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,085
a description of uncertainties.

183
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:12,779
We don't know everything and we should
acknowledge that in these estimates.

184
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:16,479
Having benefit cost analyses
that are externally reviewed

185
00:11:16,479 --> 00:11:19,661
almost always yields
better regulatory results.

186
00:11:19,661 --> 00:11:23,822
We should really make common economic
assumptions across all benefit cost

187
00:11:23,822 --> 00:11:24,491
analyses.

188
00:11:24,491 --> 00:11:26,740
So how much does a human life cost?

189
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:30,174
What's the benefit of certain
health outcomes avoided?

190
00:11:30,174 --> 00:11:34,559
And finally, a benefit-cost analysis
should focus on the main association

191
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:36,253
between benefits and costs.

192
00:11:36,253 --> 00:11:39,224
But it should also consider
the distribution and

193
00:11:39,224 --> 00:11:45,750
effects of those benefits particularly
on vulnerable or susceptible groups.

194
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:49,888
I'd like to leave you here with just an
overall view of how environmental policy

195
00:11:49,888 --> 00:11:51,133
is made and evaluated.

196
00:11:51,133 --> 00:11:55,598
So you'll see at the start here,
we're defining what the policy might be.

197
00:11:55,598 --> 00:11:58,173
What is the need that
we're trying to address?

198
00:11:58,173 --> 00:12:02,398
We're going to actually formulate and
reformulate the definition of that policy

199
00:12:02,398 --> 00:12:06,005
long before we move on to the next step,
which is agenda-setting.

200
00:12:06,005 --> 00:12:07,690
So what is our agenda?

201
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:11,110
What are we hoping to
achieve with this policy?

202
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:15,420
The next step is establishing that policy,
putting it into place.

203
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,590
After that, we implement the policy.

204
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:21,280
So once it's on the books, then it's the
job of people on the ground to actually

205
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:25,700
make this policy happen and
put it into life basically.

206
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:29,395
And the fifth but equally important
step is policy assessment.

207
00:12:29,395 --> 00:12:32,222
So once we pass a policy,
we need to review it and

208
00:12:32,222 --> 00:12:34,639
decide is it achieving the goal we want?

209
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,104
Coming back to environmental
health policy,

210
00:12:37,104 --> 00:12:40,959
is it maximizing the benefits of
environmental health to people and also

211
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:46,464
minimizing the negative impacts that the
environment can have have on human health.
