1
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:48,110
All right, then why don't we get started?

2
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:51,640
I know everybody. On February seven.

3
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:56,060
As you probably think about, I want to tell you that this is about me.

4
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:05,210
My day job is managing director of all three of the programs in the Boston business.

5
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,930
I worked on the programs.

6
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:14,480
Global energy. I have taught business,

7
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:26,450
communication and communications through university in presentation skills as a coach in various events and communications for.

8
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:30,670
So that is really the.

9
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:38,060
Tell me about you. A local party.

10
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:51,400
The way I make you pay for theater. Administration.

11
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:27,180
The. Great.

12
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:40,300
Yes. You know.

13
00:05:42,770 --> 00:06:12,400
There we go. I appreciate.

14
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,760
So here. So I. Yes, this.

15
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:46,230
I'm husband. And the language. So lots of you in the health care administration.

16
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:54,630
That is great news, assuming that it will be very easy for you to be able to do the research.

17
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:02,400
So the way I kind of do this thing is sort of this is it is about kind of giving formal presentations.

18
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:13,559
But I think these skills are transferable as well to speaking well and moving on to dealing with your boss, to dealing with the professor.

19
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:21,740
Right. So it's kind of all these. So as you know we got beat here.

20
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:31,200
Paris one thing the also true but you know this is the very last time that I would be doing this.

21
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:34,220
It's like I'm retiring at the end of the year.

22
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:39,290
So anything could happen in a year. Just just be wild because it really does.

23
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:43,370
It is just lots of fun. So behave yourselves.

24
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:49,790
I did tell you that I would give you detention. So as I said, I'm retiring.

25
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:57,500
And, you know, we've all gone through COVID well. So we've spent a lot of time in the house, going to spend a lot of time on Zoom.

26
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:04,040
And it has caused me to change this presentation in a lot of ways.

27
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,550
Right. Life is short, life is precious.

28
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:15,710
So we really don't want to waste our time and basically we don't want to waste our time listening to this guy.

29
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:19,520
Right. So this is every stock photo you've ever seen.

30
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:23,170
I'm going to pick on Ross for the Ross students, I hope apply.

31
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:31,010
This is every Ross you know business needed in their suit for Men's Wearhouse which to a PowerPoint

32
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:39,739
presentation tell me what things all I went to a conference about a month ago and there was a guy came in,

33
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:45,319
he was a consultant to kids because my son is going into that.

34
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,520
I have some I have some issues. It's on me.

35
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:53,040
But that's okay. I'll do the decorations for you at the end of this year.

36
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:58,910
But anyway, you know, I actually think it would just die soon to be kind of bittersweet for that.

37
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:06,709
But, you know, talking about these things about disruption and all of those words and, you know, all those kind of things.

38
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:14,930
And he said nothing. He said, Absolutely. So I am really about sort of what do you what do you want to say?

39
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:22,700
You know, how do you want to deliver the message? Right on. And let's make the messages kind of words worth delivering.

40
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:31,590
So let's get rid of this guy. So to me, it all comes down to the story of what you want to do.

41
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:41,260
He had this again. As I said, it's not just. You know, when you're in a meeting with people in the past, what you think or when you deal,

42
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:48,090
when you go, you meet with your boss once you get a job in health care, education.

43
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:53,090
It is about sort of how you think about your story.

44
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:57,310
Tony Eastley That was the most important thing.

45
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:03,990
These stories have lots of characteristics, so I'm going to take you back to your time in,

46
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:08,290
you know, in elementary school when you went to English class, I should tell you.

47
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:18,669
I have an MFA in creative writing, so I do not have any business really writing about your background.

48
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:24,970
So again, my approach to this kind of sport, it's a lot different than you might have heard of before.

49
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:28,870
So we're going to focus on the story. All right.

50
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:39,870
So think back. So you're back in your elementary school and you're taking it, which in stories share something.

51
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:43,959
What is the what is the essence of all stories?

52
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:50,720
Of what? We do have a protagonist.

53
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:54,820
And if they have a protagonist, right.

54
00:10:55,150 --> 00:11:00,520
What does that protagonist face? They face an antagonist.

55
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,880
So we have a protagonist, an antagonist.

56
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:17,650
It's great. Okay.

57
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:24,200
Across the landscape. Break from this landscape.

58
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:29,270
She did something good. Okay, so we have the protagonist and then the antagonist.

59
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:32,880
If we have a protagonist and an antagonist, we have.

60
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:38,120
Right. That is the essence of. We have come.

61
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,970
Now, you might say to yourself, well, I'm going to be.

62
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:53,040
Or I'm going to be trying to persuade people to spend their money on Project X.

63
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:56,490
Right. Where is the conflict? There is always.

64
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:03,210
Right. You just need to sort of think of that information that you need to present in that.

65
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:11,420
Okay. So and I don't I could not find the clicker and the the media guy was was not helpful.

66
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:16,700
So I'm going to have to keep running back it. It's kind of messing with my mojo but will will work on.

67
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:22,639
Okay, so everybody wants to listen to you right here.

68
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:26,030
I am doing this. Everybody wants to listen to me.

69
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:30,110
I have all of your attention, don't I? You're really excited.

70
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:36,680
You are so excited. Your young minds are ready to hear about the presentation skills.

71
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:43,160
Right? It's 1110. Then you start to think about, did I send in that rent check?

72
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,790
Right. I don't really remember. Your mind is wandering.

73
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:50,930
Then again, maybe you'll go to Miami for break.

74
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:54,739
Right. Get a job on a shrimp boat. It's going to be cold this weekend.

75
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,240
So we had a beautiful day yesterday.

76
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:02,920
But tomorrow like that and think the Heinz 40 do you think you know maybe I'll go to Miami for winter break I to you know,

77
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:10,940
just jettison all of this school stuff. I'll get a job on a shrimp boat and then you start thinking new shrimp.

78
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:16,400
Sounds really good right now, right? I think I could I think I will have shrimp for lunch.

79
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:25,430
Then finally I start to move towards the in conclusion and that gets you all excited again.

80
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:29,030
It's like, oh boy, she's almost finished what you know.

81
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:33,180
And now I want to work on my presentations. This is the way most people's kind of.

82
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:40,100
This will be the same for everybody. This will be the same for your presentations.

83
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,620
Again, this will be the same for when you speak in a meeting.

84
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:51,670
Right. We start off big, but you go to if you go too long or you don't sort of have milestones, people sort people lose attention.

85
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:56,970
All right. So what do we do? We orient the audience constantly.

86
00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:05,129
Okay. So we talk about where we're at the beginning. We tell people when we're kind of coming towards the middle and then we kind of go to the right.

87
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:08,910
So we orient the audience, console you, tell people what you're going to do,

88
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:14,660
and then you tell them Do it, and you got to move through each thing that you're doing.

89
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:20,550
You say, okay, now we're on the third thing. Right. And then finally you conclude.

90
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,560
And usually with the kind of things we're talking about, we're kind of concluding with calls to action.

91
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:30,420
Right. Again, think about your key takeaways.

92
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:41,160
So research suggests that most people in a conversation that is a half an hour or more will take away at most two.

93
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:53,180
So you make up a lot of stuff, right? So what you have to remember is that most of the time people will take away two important things.

94
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:56,390
William Faulkner once said, Kill your darlings.

95
00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:01,760
Right. So when he was when he was writing and you want to think about that and have the information,

96
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:07,250
he worked really, really hard on all of that information.

97
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:11,780
What you need to call it that is one of the most.

98
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:18,180
You call information. All right.

99
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:22,470
But we're going back to the story. Right. So we're going to go back to the story.

100
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:26,820
So we just talked about that. Storytelling is conflict.

101
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:33,000
Right. What are the stakes? And that is a very important thing when you talk about.

102
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:39,960
That is a very important thing to think about. What are the stakes if we do not do this?

103
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,650
Right. And if we do this, what is the conflict?

104
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:50,980
What are we pushing against? Right. Are we pushing against misinformation?

105
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,760
Are we pushing pushing against a lack of resources?

106
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:59,810
You need to decide that that should go into your presentation.

107
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:09,860
Storytelling is also structure. All right. So here are several and you can think about again, this sort of depends upon your topic.

108
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:14,510
But we have the audience. We have the person who goes on to turn.

109
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:20,060
Right. So the person you know, you have a question that you see.

110
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:25,580
To find out so your presentation can be about that journey.

111
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:30,350
I did this. And here is what I discovered. That was surprising.

112
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:35,550
Which led me to this, and this is what I discovered, which was surprise.

113
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:41,060
And then. And I decided this. That's not the journey.

114
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:46,800
You have the mystery. Why?

115
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:52,180
Why is this? And you are uncovering this.

116
00:16:54,020 --> 00:17:02,390
You have to. So if you think about one of the one of the most famous of what you Luther King.

117
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:08,640
So I believe what the video here is what I see.

118
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:16,700
Right. This is what I see. And we may not know better than you can judge.

119
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:21,410
Not the color of the skin, but the strength of his character that, you know, sort of.

120
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:25,980
So he paints this. Right. This wonderful picture.

121
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:31,350
And then what is that? You know, we may not get there, I mean, but we will get there.

122
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:35,940
So that kind of again, it sort of depends on the role.

123
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:40,229
You know, what what you need to protect. You're going to make these kinds of choices.

124
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:43,410
Not all presentations and and that final one.

125
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:48,510
Often times in positions of like those are the kind of speeches that you have to make.

126
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:56,860
We've got to rally the troops. Right on the famous speech we have been getting.

127
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:06,470
Pretty sure it's an independent Shakespeare, where he talks about how the night before the attack they always attack.

128
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:11,410
If you ever tackled. Tony. We will check it out.

129
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:13,310
So they're getting ready, right? We're going to check on.

130
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:26,120
And he talks about sort of, you know, many, many years from now, people will look back at this and be able to say, like, wow, why couldn't we?

131
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:32,480
He's happy for you. Right. You know, why couldn't we have been there?

132
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:38,910
It would have been such a privilege to. Because we will we will stand up to.

133
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:45,400
And some of those are kind of very experienced leadership countries speeches,

134
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:50,890
which all of you, as you go on to be successful, will have to give at one point in time.

135
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:58,300
All right. Storytelling as well. So we talked about structure, we talked about conflict.

136
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,840
We talk about rates of storytelling.

137
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:06,510
Use this technique and think about fiction that you've read the movies that you want to.

138
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:12,760
They're different, right? So. Two kind of very famous rules.

139
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,670
When you think about fiction writing, one is check.

140
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:24,520
So one of the things that Chekhov said was if you if you show up on the screen in the first part of the.

141
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:35,260
One has to go on. So this idea of referring to something at the beginning, trying to get people's attention.

142
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:43,980
But you make sure that you come back to the. At the end of the presentation, there can be a question that you want to ask as you.

143
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:51,440
Definitely something like that, but it could be a story that you tell.

144
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:55,410
So I had a student want to give to me on.

145
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:00,380
It was that microloan company called Stop.

146
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:14,170
And the student was delivering a presentation about Cuba and talked about at the beginning a woman who me was.

147
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:28,240
She being eight and she she would constantly she beat so many of them to sell that she would burn out the sewing machine.

148
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:34,370
Because she just needs and wants it just so and so.

149
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:44,410
Just keep getting so. So she got a microloan from Cuba which allowed her to buy a commercial sewing machine,

150
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:49,030
which allowed her to produce more, which allowed her to hire more people.

151
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:56,230
So the students started with this story. And sort of problem.

152
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:02,650
Then went on to sort of describe how he works, what happens with his.

153
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:09,470
And then at the end, when he returns. Look, there she is.

154
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:13,670
So again, that's sort of a Chekhovian that goes off.

155
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:18,760
Like the guy with the gun is shown with the start of the guns.

156
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:24,410
We know that Hemingway's rule, which is the idea of rhythm.

157
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:32,710
And so Hemingway once said, I think he said something about the ghost, but in the short a short straw.

158
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:36,920
What you to do is. Audience.

159
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:50,670
For sale. The. So think about the number of words that that means and what it content.

160
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:59,870
So we just talked about sort of restricting of information to key points.

161
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:08,750
When you look at your slides, things like that, think about stripping the language to pieces of language.

162
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:14,590
So it's really, really important that the writer George Saunders once said.

163
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:21,530
So I write a sentence and it says, Harold walked into the room and sat on the couch.

164
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:30,840
And then I ask myself, Why does the couch? Then I say we'll sit here and walk into the room, he said.

165
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:38,340
Well. Why is there so? Volunteer walked into the reflecting pool.

166
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:47,360
Walk into the. So that's what you need to do to strike out everything that is not important.

167
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:51,930
I'm going to talk a lot about books and movies because that's what I do.

168
00:22:52,170 --> 00:23:00,720
Now we're going to do something here. So I am sure that if you did not see Titanic as a child, you kind of know the story.

169
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:09,360
Right? It's one of those movies that people. So does anyone remember if you did?

170
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:14,560
A wall. Yeah.

171
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:22,760
It's on two pages. Oh, wow. All right.

172
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,990
So okay, so it is a long, long movie.

173
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:35,730
So here's what I want you to do, is I want you to tell me we are going to describe the whole story, a whole plot of the 20.

174
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:41,490
The body. So.

175
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:51,870
So please tell me the story of the Titanic in the 5 seconds.

176
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:56,330
So someone pulled out an important plot.

177
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:02,330
Doesn't have to be in order. Yes. The boat sank.

178
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:06,420
I'd say that's pretty important. So we're going to put.

179
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:14,870
Quote. I love the chalkboard.

180
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,050
I don't think I've been in a room with a chalkboard in, like a really long time.

181
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:22,830
Yes. Jack.

182
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:29,420
Jack. Jack. Jack.

183
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:35,310
Jack Dodds.

184
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:48,710
Okay. Very good. Now, sometimes when I do this, people will say that the woman I remember her name, she murders jack horses and walked out that door.

185
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:58,290
I don't think so. I used to be strong, but partly due to her.

186
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:07,550
All. I would say she's heard about it.

187
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:11,180
I'm not joking. Come on with a big gulp.

188
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:15,210
All right, we've got to. What's another one?

189
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:23,480
Yes, we better. Yes. We got this one last.

190
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:31,660
Okay. Let's try. If you fall in love.

191
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:38,800
Perfect. This was a. So we would call that, I think, in the movie business.

192
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:44,880
It's like a jack. What was her name? Does anybody remember Rose?

193
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:57,090
That was it. In the movie business we call that meet cute.

194
00:25:57,930 --> 00:26:01,790
So you meet the cute girl. Okay. So you got.

195
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:05,100
Yes, Rose remembers. There we go.

196
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:10,590
Rose remembers at the end of the summer about a necklace. Frozen diamonds, right?

197
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:23,010
Okay. I think we're missing one thing. So let's look at this together.

198
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:26,240
Let's look at this. So we've got Jack and Rose Meet, Fall in Love.

199
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:30,830
Both sings, Jack Dies, Rose remembers.

200
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:34,480
I think there's one important story element that we do not have.

201
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:44,460
Oh, yes. What's up? Well, let's just focus on Sidney Summers.

202
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:50,180
Yes, uh, that's. The most.

203
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:57,520
Right. Jack meets a girl. And the girl falls in love with Jack.

204
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:06,360
Why is that forbidden? Yeah, we got the answer right.

205
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:12,570
So I would put that there. So trouble ensues.

206
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:22,360
Right. We've got the fort, we've got the class differences. We've got the fee on, say, the movie upside.

207
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:30,930
Okay. So you have turned a seven hour movie into five key points, right?

208
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:34,910
So that's what I want you to think about when you think about presentations.

209
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:42,799
Right. A lot of times, you know, I see this a lot in in in presentations, particularly with students.

210
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:46,580
You've again, you've done a lot of work, you've done a lot of research.

211
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:51,430
And it really is about how do you how do you take things out?

212
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:56,690
And when you speak, it's the same thing. Like when you, again,

213
00:27:56,690 --> 00:28:06,110
are trying to give your point of view to people or to your boss or whatever it is about people that people kind of they will zoom.

214
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:09,770
So brevity, structure and brevity.

215
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:13,760
All right. So we've talked about this.

216
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,990
We've talked about kind of content and how you shape your content.

217
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:22,440
I, I can't kind of go any further without sort of other content.

218
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:29,150
As you think about the slide process and all that, I have some examples of content.

219
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:34,180
All right. So we're going to talk about Slack.

220
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:37,540
So we talk about your content and sort of shape your content.

221
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:42,620
You know what you want to say. And now let's talk about what slides look like.

222
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:48,710
Again, there are different kinds. So in the same way that your structure might be different,

223
00:28:49,190 --> 00:29:00,920
in the same way that the kind of information might be different on your slides can be different depending upon the purpose of the presentation.

224
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:05,590
So again, there is one right way. It depends upon you.

225
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:10,140
It depends upon the purpose of the presentation, depends upon what the presentation needs to do.

226
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:14,210
So let's talk about this a little bit. So.

227
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:20,390
I just said that, right? Sort of. What is your slide deck for?

228
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:30,650
Right. Is it detailed support? So what I mean is is it is it you are up here and you are talking.

229
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:35,500
Well, some of the things that you are delivering are not the to the conversations.

230
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:39,650
And so it's hard to get just from a speaking voice.

231
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:49,630
So is that detailed support from. So is that the purpose of your slide deck on or is it a working document to be passed on?

232
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:54,670
So, you know, consultants are big on dense.

233
00:29:56,620 --> 00:30:01,180
So someone you know, because they have the meeting and they have the presentation.

234
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:05,020
But oftentimes, what the slide decks are meant to be passed on.

235
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:12,830
Right? And so someone who is not in the presentation can read that slide deck and get more information.

236
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:17,110
Right. So the detailed or is it like a back up to the speaker?

237
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:28,500
Oftentimes. For when you know you go to conference is that person who's.

238
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:33,639
Invited to come speak on the topic. And there will probably be something.

239
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:40,530
Really. What proposal? Speaker About something and they will often let her slide.

240
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:46,290
Decks are often loaded with germs and things like that because the idea is to look at this.

241
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:53,770
The idea is that you think that what you have is that the speaker has this charisma that they want.

242
00:30:54,750 --> 00:31:00,200
Right. So the deck is going to. We talk about.

243
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:11,800
So we can think about purpose. I mean, I would say that probably most of you in this kind of situation are probably in the first or second world.

244
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:17,250
At this point in time and your academic career. But you never know.

245
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:26,630
So I'm going to show you some examples here. So this is kind of a very, very typical and IT consultant.

246
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:35,100
You kind of slide. Right. Lots of information, lots of things up there to tell you what.

247
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:43,850
So this was from a you know, this is from a back to you that I had written two years ago.

248
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:53,299
So that projects are where this the students go out and they they have a challenge to look at a

249
00:31:53,300 --> 00:32:00,560
problem from a company and they then have to do a research and then have to present recommendations.

250
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:04,350
So they do a presentation. The loans have debts.

251
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:10,150
So this was kind of a very, very typical kind of consulting.

252
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:15,790
Has lots of info. If I missed the meeting I can probably get this thing.

253
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:21,420
You probably understand what's going on.

254
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:30,270
And so very kind of typical. This my students at Google.

255
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:40,599
So the part time MBA students come to me as part of my programs that I manage and that I want people to Google where in the program they say,

256
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:43,930
this is what Google. It's what we wanted.

257
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:50,530
So these slides would be wow and conclusions and stuff.

258
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:56,000
So my wall of detail just looked at. They'll get it.

259
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:02,990
Right. So this is kind of a again, I would say this is more of that sort of.

260
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:11,530
Not the details. We're talking.

261
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:18,960
You're talking. Another slide, I think sort of is that is the saying is this kind of stuff.

262
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:28,050
Right. So eye catching. But again, not not high level information, just sort of theatrical.

263
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:33,330
And look at me. I am the speaker. I will you know, you will remember me.

264
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:43,350
Now, one thing that I should tell you is that I am like most people will say, I am more likely to say that.

265
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:53,280
So I do have fun with my slides and just listen to them all and that's me.

266
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:57,440
Just respond like that.

267
00:33:57,450 --> 00:34:00,630
You don't really respond to visual information.

268
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:06,230
There is a. Time to bring out this new that.

269
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:13,310
And he he was a big dig that.

270
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:18,620
But one thing that he was really really really cool that he did this.

271
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:23,660
He worked with students on how to present information.

272
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,850
He even called my slides. We talked about that.

273
00:34:29,410 --> 00:34:44,590
But there is a book and it's almost like a coffee table book, but it is actually representation of a form of information.

274
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:49,890
So how you usually represent. And it is a beautiful.

275
00:34:52,690 --> 00:35:00,180
How he uses the what might be sort of unfortunate concepts to make you feel way.

276
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:09,190
So that was one of the famous one of Napoleon's losses in Russia that the Russians.

277
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:14,410
There are their numbers of. Deeper and deeper.

278
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:20,049
And then there's this red line that's going down with the red arrow.

279
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:21,610
We get fatter and fatter.

280
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:30,100
And it's just it's sort of like, okay, we know losses mounting, but it sort of gives you this sort of emotional connection to the data.

281
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:35,040
So. And we're talking very cool. You can take my slides.

282
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:45,120
Okay. So. My favorite slide that's for kind of a typical presentation, followed what I would call paragraph.

283
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:54,360
So again, go back to your elementary school education and think about the topics and concerns.

284
00:35:55,720 --> 00:36:04,270
And so topic, sentence and so forth. So to me, the header, which is, you know, that should be Trump real estate is the only one.

285
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:07,360
The typical PowerPoint slides, that is the most important thing.

286
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:11,980
That's what people look at the most. That's your topic sentence.

287
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:21,560
And then anything below that is your. To me, I think one of my favorite things would be if you could.

288
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:30,090
Be able to read that cover. So you've got a slide deck and I can read the headers, you know, the story line of.

289
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:35,490
Think that's like a good rule of thumb to follow up.

290
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:40,830
All right. So I'm going to show you an example. So this, again,

291
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:48,240
is something from a course that I taught where people basically had to make a persuasive

292
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:56,190
argument and to do a presentation where they were the leadership group of a a person's culture.

293
00:36:56,730 --> 00:36:59,760
And they had to decide they had limited resources as.

294
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:05,720
And they had to decide what they were going to do to grow this.

295
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:17,880
So they could pick a variety that she was like, Well, we invested in a grocery store and then they had to give a presentation.

296
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:22,440
So this group chose grocery delivery.

297
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:34,590
Right. And their key thing was that we will do we will grow our business by offering grocery delivery, but will also care with the with.

298
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:40,360
And here's a few of their slides, which to me follow this rule.

299
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:46,510
Right. So. So grocery delivery makes sense for choice foods.

300
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:51,310
Right. And there's their support. Right? So here's why.

301
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:56,060
Restaurant delivery makes sense. Then.

302
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:01,020
Planned forecasts to bring net profit growth up 32%.

303
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:05,730
So it makes sense. It makes financial sense.

304
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:10,680
Here's why. And then finally, execution is our key focus.

305
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:16,670
So like this idea, I've come up with some slides, but this is how the presentation works, right?

306
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:20,790
So this is what we've decided. Here's why. This slide.

307
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:25,450
This is what it will deliver, right? Profits.

308
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:30,760
Here's why. Here's the theory. And then finally, this is almost kind of a call to action.

309
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:34,410
Right here is the thing that we to focus on is execution.

310
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:44,700
And here's why. So, again, that sort of topic sentence support is a really good basic way to kind of wrangle your information together.

311
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:52,060
All righty, then. Slight design standards, just somewhat basic tips.

312
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:55,390
You probably know these already untrue slides.

313
00:38:55,660 --> 00:39:00,880
You want to use a master template which is very, very good just for a professional thing.

314
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:11,350
ANNOUNCER Fonts are really best visually, so people say that several fonts are good for papers like that you're actually reading,

315
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:14,980
but the presentation is not so much better.

316
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:19,959
Again, use an appropriate and a uniform font size.

317
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:26,070
So just as you go through your slides, the type, the, the size of the,

318
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:32,650
the type to not look down to what it should be, it sort of one sounds no matter what.

319
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:42,140
The idea is not to draw attention to design that you should not wear your slides.

320
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:47,120
Very important to know in order to see what I would have on your site.

321
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:56,180
I once had a boss where we had gone to the head to a business meeting and the

322
00:39:56,180 --> 00:40:03,720
team had not number of the slots I for the meeting and this would be the well.

323
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:10,400
So make sure you cover your sides. Again, that idea of maintaining uniformity.

324
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:14,730
So the idea is that you've got and doing a lot of.

325
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:22,320
And I think visually, again, it's not my forte, but it's yours.

326
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:30,630
But I would also go very easy on one person, that sort of standard, all these things that you can find.

327
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:35,100
I would I think I, I, I hate that kind of stuff.

328
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:39,750
Um, okay, so we've talked about what the slides look like.

329
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:44,700
Right. We are now going to talk about a delivery of the presentation.

330
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:48,390
So again, it sort of depends upon a couple of things.

331
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:55,120
It depends upon you and your style. It depends upon how comfortable you are.

332
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:58,140
It depends upon what you are, what you're doing.

333
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:03,530
I, I mean, I think you can sort of see volume is casual.

334
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:08,870
And I really actually I am almost always in this kind of sense.

335
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:17,430
Into my pockets and the room closer to people than you may not be comfortable with.

336
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:24,829
But you may also think about sort of what the you know, again,

337
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:40,010
the sort of purpose of your presentation is I suppose it might be a speech to a press conference or something like that.

338
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:48,919
I'd be behind the podium or something like that. Generally, again, I delivered a presentation at the conference that I was at.

339
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:57,770
I was more closer to everybody like this, more an informal presentation might call to that,

340
00:41:57,770 --> 00:42:04,970
but I do tend to think that it's what you're comfortable with when you're talking with staff.

341
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:10,820
As you become leaders, you will want to get, I think, closer to your people.

342
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:14,240
You'll want to be closer. All right. So.

343
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,990
Let's talk about data. Three things, right?

344
00:42:20,410 --> 00:42:23,760
You have a slide with data. Here's what you want to do.

345
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:30,310
What is it? What should I look at? And what should I?

346
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:35,610
To the other side. You do not go through everything.

347
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:45,540
That is that you see people. So these are the three things when you have.

348
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:53,040
So let me make something. Um, here is the.

349
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:57,990
The number of. Applications.

350
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:03,770
We have received. For the school.

351
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:08,870
So here's the number. That is what is the difference? Here is the.

352
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:15,880
As you will see, we got a huge jump in applications.

353
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:22,010
From the year 2020 to 2022.

354
00:43:22,490 --> 00:43:28,530
So I'm telling people what to do. We would conclude that perhaps.

355
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:40,340
Because of COVID, people are starting to realize the importance of the efficiency of hospitals.

356
00:43:41,070 --> 00:43:44,280
The importance of food culture falls under the.

357
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:49,070
But you can see what I was like. What is it?

358
00:43:50,070 --> 00:43:55,310
What should I look at? What should I do? So it's a really good way.

359
00:43:56,210 --> 00:43:59,510
To present data. All right.

360
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:04,410
We're going to try an example. Okay. So here is a sample slide.

361
00:44:06,090 --> 00:44:13,440
So this is from Statista and it is the most popular time of the year to propose.

362
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:22,080
All right. He asked us, both men and women, the most popular time of the year to propose.

363
00:44:22,810 --> 00:44:26,680
So I want you to take a look at this slide. You can talk to each other.

364
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:35,540
And decide what ought to be. And, you know, we have all kinds of stuff up there.

365
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:39,170
Right. But you're giving a presentation.

366
00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:47,390
Pick an important point and tell me what this slide to take a couple of minutes.

367
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:54,000
We can do this together. I will then ask you to conserve this.

368
00:44:58,410 --> 00:45:09,290
And I will call. I think.

369
00:45:30,610 --> 00:45:59,610
Yeah. Well. Okay.

370
00:45:59,610 --> 00:46:03,960
So once you've reached the conclusion of what you want to tell us about, think about how you.

371
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:15,330
So what is it? What do you want to buy the audience's eye towards?

372
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:20,810
And what do you what do you think they should think? You're going to try to tell them what to do?

373
00:46:20,930 --> 00:46:25,190
Okay. Love.

374
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:56,470
Does anybody else have a different way to pull something else out of the blue?

375
00:46:57,730 --> 00:47:00,910
I like. This.

376
00:47:04,290 --> 00:47:07,880
Which is interesting. Okay. I don't know.

377
00:47:08,590 --> 00:47:18,240
The man. I. But Saudi intelligence.

378
00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:25,930
Yes. Okay. All right. So your point is that it is a surprise to.

379
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:32,530
That. That your life?

380
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:36,070
Tell us what you want the audience to take away.

381
00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:45,150
Point is that there are certain things in what they're being told that.

382
00:47:47,090 --> 00:47:50,580
That's great. That's a mouthful. Uh, I.

383
00:47:57,890 --> 00:48:01,750
And that's just purely thinking about that.

384
00:48:01,850 --> 00:48:10,990
Now you're saying that. You know, I think we'll just.

385
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:20,230
Your presentation, your work in Dallas. When somebody asks the question, what's something?

386
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:24,090
It's always been. I know.

387
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:25,249
That is very interesting.

388
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:35,510
So you're saying, like, if you did it on Christmas Eve and and your partner said, yeah, every Christmas Eve, you would think about that.

389
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:40,520
I want everyone to think about that.

390
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:49,880
And this person said that it could be more. Yeah, I guess.

391
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:56,690
I. You're not very optimistic.

392
00:48:56,690 --> 00:49:03,799
Of course, I know, but I feel like I just wanted to ask you something.

393
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:16,400
They said the way. Well, I would not I wouldn't have such a specific date in my life.

394
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:23,440
Okay. All right. Well, this.

395
00:49:26,070 --> 00:49:32,950
This is great. Yes. I know is.

396
00:49:40,230 --> 00:49:49,959
So. All right.

397
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:54,280
So that is right. So I guess it's all good and.

398
00:49:57,070 --> 00:50:11,740
But yet that was sort of what I often think about when I think about this slog, is that so to me one of the so women chose date they met.

399
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:17,890
Right. But men like look at where the discrepancies are.

400
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:22,420
Like men think birthday is great.

401
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:26,820
Men also think Christmas Eve is great.

402
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:31,280
What do you get from that? You.

403
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:38,849
And. It's just. Okay.

404
00:50:38,850 --> 00:50:42,760
I think a lot. When I.

405
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:48,970
Of which is generally. I think that's interesting.

406
00:50:48,970 --> 00:50:55,860
You I would imagine that they just want to get out of line and then that's going to happen.

407
00:50:56,930 --> 00:51:07,570
Is that like when they want to turn it into a date, they have this wonderful book, but they're thinking, no, I'm not going to get paid for this.

408
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:13,750
Welcome back to. It is strategic.

409
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:23,650
I do. I do. Now, of course, the big mystery is any one who would decide Boxing Day was the day of woe, which I find amazing.

410
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:27,760
So I used to live in London. I never quite understood what Boxing Day was.

411
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:36,670
But anyway, so. But all good. So our conclusion here is you presented this like, well, also that there are different things.

412
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:43,229
And that actually is a warning to us, because there have been many,

413
00:51:43,230 --> 00:51:51,150
many times when I have been either in a meeting with with data slides or something like that.

414
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:56,070
And I said, here is my story of the data.

415
00:51:56,340 --> 00:51:59,370
And then other people in the meeting picked up the story.

416
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:03,870
Okay. So just that that is sort of a that happens to us all.

417
00:52:04,290 --> 00:52:05,159
You were in a meeting.

418
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:13,710
You had sort of a certain story about your data with other people, particularly the people your bosses can pick up other stories and data.

419
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:24,479
So, you know, a very good thing to remember is that you need to make sure that you know your data well enough that you can talk on other things,

420
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:31,570
about other things. But that was excellent and a very interesting window into the quest.

421
00:52:31,590 --> 00:52:40,950
Thank you so much. So okay. So when we talk about presenting again, some people are kind of good at this kind of thing.

422
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:43,799
Some people aren't. There are certain things.

423
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:50,040
I think what I would always say is when I talk presentation classes, which is I always want to get somebody to the next level.

424
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:54,800
Right. So I would always say, you know, that you're you're a little better now.

425
00:52:54,850 --> 00:53:00,140
You a little better. You know, if you're really good, you come in and when you leave, you're just a little bit.

426
00:53:00,670 --> 00:53:04,150
So there's a couple of kind of common things people write.

427
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:10,210
The first one is small boys. So, you know, particularly with women.

428
00:53:13,570 --> 00:53:21,340
The sort of theater thing is, is that we speak for we here and that you'll notice if you're speaking from here when

429
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:26,680
you give a presentation teacher or something like that and after say about 45 minutes,

430
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:32,000
it was very dry talking. I'll need to speak with you.

431
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:38,120
A quick way to sort of test that for yourself is sort of what you think you should feel kind of a slip.

432
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:50,860
If you're kind of drawing, you're up for a presentation, but it is sort of like, so you drunk, you would kind of make your voice sort of a little.

433
00:53:52,020 --> 00:54:02,460
You speak too quickly. There are many people who do this very, very quick way to work on this is the first time yourself.

434
00:54:02,790 --> 00:54:10,560
So take some things. Recite a poem in time yourself.

435
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:15,760
And then go back and say to yourself, I will add 30 seconds.

436
00:54:16,390 --> 00:54:21,740
The one thing. And do it again. I will add an additional 30 seconds.

437
00:54:25,010 --> 00:54:34,440
To slow down. Speaking quickly is not the solution to going over your.

438
00:54:36,470 --> 00:54:43,790
So speaking quickly is not the solution to having too much information.

439
00:54:44,950 --> 00:54:48,800
To present. The solution to that is pulling out.

440
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:59,420
In fact, a good thing to do sometimes is you want to review your blog that you can print it out.

441
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:07,520
All one sided and it's good to sort of just spread it out and see how much you have.

442
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:11,840
Usually the rule of thumb is one minute per slide.

443
00:55:12,110 --> 00:55:15,470
That's usually the rule of thumb. Some force will take far less.

444
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:21,180
There could be four slides in here. So this presentation is usually about 40 minutes.

445
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:23,420
What kind of interaction and all that.

446
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:35,440
So that is a really good way to sort of spread stuff out and sort of see how your slides and what and compare it to a lot of time.

447
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:39,700
That's another good way to sort of move the sense of structure.

448
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:44,870
There may be times when we look at that structure and say, you know, I'm not going to.

449
00:55:46,870 --> 00:55:55,990
So I didn't like that kind of actual. Some people are almost or white.

450
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:06,260
Okay. We got some. I actually think that if you have that kind of thing, it's really not what's inside.

451
00:56:11,230 --> 00:56:16,620
You have it? I do. I used to write poetry.

452
00:56:19,150 --> 00:56:25,250
His family was. So it's got distracting.

453
00:56:27,670 --> 00:56:31,390
If you don't like it is every other word and it's very distracting for you.

454
00:56:31,810 --> 00:56:36,550
In this friend of yours. Each and every time.

455
00:56:37,670 --> 00:56:45,600
You say? They raised you until you really tried to instead of have like a split second silence.

456
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:50,280
I think overall, the problem is, you know, like that weird pause.

457
00:56:51,830 --> 00:56:55,240
You probably know. So.

458
00:56:55,450 --> 00:57:01,270
So that's a good way to do it. You can have a little split second of silence rather than.

459
00:57:02,230 --> 00:57:06,410
So the word is far less distracting. We would have preferred instead.

460
00:57:09,550 --> 00:57:13,660
But something like that will help you get rid of more.

461
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:17,440
It really is just sort of the brain is thinking about the next thing.

462
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:21,640
Okay. Be aware of your body language.

463
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:32,420
So a lot of people, you know, there's that sort of stance, a little bit of control since the point research that is super mainstream.

464
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:42,310
But one of the great things about that, that sort of beat playing in the power sector is that this really it's opening up to a lot.

465
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:48,830
That's really messed up so badly. See, I am Italian.

466
00:57:49,010 --> 00:57:52,040
My parents were from Sicily, so my dreams go on.

467
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:55,840
What if that is natural to you? That's why I often.

468
00:57:57,630 --> 00:58:02,940
So it's not too distracting. But think about that when you want to avoid that.

469
00:58:02,950 --> 00:58:06,050
I want to know what.

470
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:14,570
So it's very hard to find the right.

471
00:58:16,510 --> 00:58:21,319
All right, so where are your body language? And also, I'm a pacer.

472
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:24,620
I'm a mover. If you're a mover, that can help you, too.

473
00:58:25,490 --> 00:58:35,570
All right. For non-native speakers, you may someday be called upon to give a speech in a language that was not your native language.

474
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:40,429
I would say there's a few things to remember, so to speak, more slowly.

475
00:58:40,430 --> 00:58:45,440
So you're going to have less information. You will depend upon your slide deck a lot more.

476
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:50,010
So it's definitely much more important to me.

477
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:57,210
The other thing too, even with a native speaker, if your decks are complex.

478
00:58:57,730 --> 00:59:03,080
Right. So you think about that, that consultant for I've done stuff for the School of Engineering here.

479
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:12,300
I really had no idea what they were talking about. When. All the best slides and really complex information.

480
00:59:12,450 --> 00:59:17,009
What you might want to use at the bottom of your slide deck for those travelers you

481
00:59:17,010 --> 00:59:25,780
could find in a PowerPoint that I didn't track of where you are in the presentation.

482
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:31,690
Audiences might. So that's. So you can use the tracker as well.

483
00:59:31,870 --> 00:59:35,380
And that would be a really good thing to for a non-native speaker.

484
00:59:35,650 --> 00:59:40,680
And you can still communicate interest and passion. This this is the one thing I want to.

485
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:45,310
They sort of. If you don't believe.

486
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:53,760
If you are interested in. Within minutes.

487
00:59:57,010 --> 01:00:00,490
And it really is about sex. It's about the.

488
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:06,800
You get every good movie or television show or book that you experienced.

489
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:12,950
And it is about the. We raise the stakes if we don't do this.

490
01:00:15,690 --> 01:00:20,050
That is what this is about with interest and passion.

491
01:00:22,150 --> 01:00:27,320
All right. We're all on Zoom land. Cut down on your slides.

492
01:00:27,740 --> 01:00:31,390
Get really good with the share among share functions. I think that's really important.

493
01:00:31,430 --> 01:00:39,860
So whenever I want to zoom in on slides, I'm always popping up as soon as someone asks the question itself on the slides.

494
01:00:42,490 --> 01:00:46,180
So. People who see the other.

495
01:00:46,330 --> 01:00:52,900
I think that's really important. And with discussion. There is research that says.

496
01:00:53,580 --> 01:01:00,490
That if you are in fact, in an online universe, in a virtual universe and delivering to people,

497
01:01:00,510 --> 01:01:04,889
you can't see body language, you can't get up close to earth like I've been doing for you.

498
01:01:04,890 --> 01:01:09,830
Right then recognize that you need to constantly.

499
01:01:10,810 --> 01:01:22,030
So research does sometimes suggest that, in fact, these kinds of things like charts and polls, particularly polls, are really good to really take.

500
01:01:23,050 --> 01:01:25,630
So something that you probably might not be doing.

501
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:35,190
You know, you are in the building like this because you have like all of my funny feet, you know, one five feet tall.

502
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:40,180
So all of that seems to make you look at me so I wouldn't have that on Zoom.

503
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:44,350
So things like that can kind of keep going.

504
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:52,140
Research has suggested that. Let's talk about answering questions.

505
01:01:52,170 --> 01:01:55,170
You've delivered that great presentation.

506
01:01:56,340 --> 01:02:01,470
I think your biggest thing is to avoid the rap. So what you want to think about is,

507
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:12,180
is how to answer questions succinctly and also how to sort of close the loop so that you can move on to more questions.

508
01:02:12,930 --> 01:02:19,680
That is really sort of the biggest thing. So again, think about that main point and stop talking.

509
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:25,350
That's it, right? So go to that main point and stop talking.

510
01:02:26,430 --> 01:02:32,550
When you have somebody who sort of has a long holiday, they're not.

511
01:02:33,590 --> 01:02:38,860
Given the many conservatives satisfied with the answer in physical place.

512
01:02:38,870 --> 01:02:43,130
This is what I have often done. It's sort of a really good way to do this,

513
01:02:43,670 --> 01:02:53,960
and you can do it virtually as well because you can sort of start addressing the person's questions, but move to a more general.

514
01:02:54,820 --> 01:02:59,770
Then in a physical place, which means you will ask me questions.

515
01:03:00,190 --> 01:03:04,080
I will start with two questions here, but I'm to return.

516
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:10,310
Address the rest. So I made that connection.

517
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:15,700
But then I returned and I won't answer the question to the general.

518
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:23,270
So it's a good way to sort of lose that sense that it's having one conversation.

519
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:29,040
Cut off the question quickly. So you can alienate the audience.

520
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:33,110
It was sort of really dangerous to do that.

521
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:37,830
Right. And I think. We're done.

522
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:43,680
So let's say goodbye to this guy with a suit for Men's Wearhouse.

523
01:03:45,370 --> 01:03:51,750
The PowerPoint slides that. With all of this them once again.

524
01:03:52,260 --> 01:03:56,460
Right. If you are not interested in what you have to say.

525
01:03:57,530 --> 01:04:01,280
No one else would be. Okay. I know.

526
01:04:09,470 --> 01:04:13,850
It's something. And he might have some.

527
01:04:16,430 --> 01:04:29,370
Can something happen? And people are already thinking about having a condition and getting a lot of things that be like you.

528
01:04:31,260 --> 01:04:36,920
So how do you handle and present your ideas and make them?

529
01:04:37,650 --> 01:04:44,910
Yes, a very good question. So negative views. So, you know, in general, when people talk about this.

530
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:53,860
What people usually say is we. So I believe that we should invest.

531
01:04:54,980 --> 01:05:02,240
We? I would say that that is like 900 times.

532
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:09,250
That is really. Sometimes it is not.

533
01:05:09,810 --> 01:05:15,730
When? So do they need to build up to?

534
01:05:17,910 --> 01:05:24,570
Now if in fact, you're coming in and people already know.

535
01:05:25,750 --> 01:05:29,610
That maybe. And then.

536
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:35,060
I would. Still build up to.

537
01:05:36,730 --> 01:05:40,420
So what? But the only difference there would be.

538
01:05:40,870 --> 01:05:51,800
I would acknowledge that you. We know that everybody is frustrated and worried about the future of this company.

539
01:05:52,750 --> 01:06:02,170
Now that he's on Boston's. So let's talk about why this happened and let's talk about what?

540
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:11,090
So you're still working on. But that would be something.

541
01:06:11,690 --> 01:06:18,079
Yes. I don't think we're actually bringing that up. Is that in general, as I said, you usually start with a recommendation,

542
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:24,030
but sometimes you may not be able to do that if you come out with a very negative recommendation, never into third.

543
01:06:39,690 --> 01:06:45,360
Well, yeah. I mean, it's but it sort of depends upon your style.

544
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:57,480
So. One thing. Audience participation is the greatest thing, you know, when you engage people and ask them to do something for you.

545
01:06:57,990 --> 01:07:04,890
I think that's great. I think and if you don't have that point in your presentation.

546
01:07:05,670 --> 01:07:13,820
Then I think it's fun to kind of take a pause and to go to somebody and say, Tell me what?

547
01:07:15,220 --> 01:07:20,170
How much support? And also you will notice how many I.

548
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:33,040
That. I have all.

549
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:41,860
I want to talk more about that because I think that and.

550
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:49,160
And really good speakers. You'll see how they walk out the door on that one.

551
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:56,870
Audience engagement. Absolutely. I mean, I was called the starter just like I used to be.

552
01:07:57,850 --> 01:08:03,490
I wanted to talk about. Other questions.

553
01:08:05,660 --> 01:08:16,350
Okay. Well, Dave, this is my final one. This one is very well behaved and hopefully there.

554
01:08:21,020 --> 01:08:31,990
I. That's true.

555
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:45,730
We need to do anything. It's not. You wonder how I would get rid of that?

556
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:51,030
Please turn off the projector and restore original settings.

557
01:08:52,780 --> 01:09:06,910
When you aren't doing anything on the projector.

558
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:35,120
What they're. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

559
01:09:35,940 --> 01:09:39,570
I don't know. I think that. I don't.

560
01:09:45,020 --> 01:09:49,870
Yeah, I just know that.

561
01:09:50,410 --> 01:09:58,810
Would you like to hear how they do that?

562
01:09:59,650 --> 01:10:08,470
And I know that I did it. 3.6.

563
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:17,590
I. I.

564
01:10:32,250 --> 01:10:36,580
Oh, yeah. Oh, that's.

565
01:10:38,170 --> 01:10:45,030
And. But think.
