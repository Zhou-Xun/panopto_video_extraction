1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:21,390
Yeah. Yeah, we used to just provide it for us and it was always like, Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I got it.

2
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:26,520
I can understood. That might be when I break. It might be a good time to do something, but.

3
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:31,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:55,820
I know it's tough to say because like, you know, like, isn't we're it was just it was so funny.

5
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:10,750
I said, oh, well. I got a smoking gun last week.

6
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:18,500
Got. Little things. I'd like to see just.

7
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:34,570
Now, remember, while I was there, I was just thinking, you know what?

8
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:40,310
Yeah, I've got something for you.

9
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:56,890
And so I went to see him.

10
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:13,190
Did you get along and say, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

11
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:21,610
Yeah. That was more of this one instance.

12
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:39,490
Now, things are all sorts of things. I guess I probably shouldn't be so close to my girlfriend.

13
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:49,970
That's not what I heard. Some of the most amazing things she did.

14
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,010
He proposed to me.

15
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:59,870
Oh, okay. And my notes.

16
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:02,920
I said, we ended right here. We talked about the batteries and energy.

17
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:06,430
Does that ring a bell? Is that where we ended? Yeah.

18
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,330
I didn't know.
