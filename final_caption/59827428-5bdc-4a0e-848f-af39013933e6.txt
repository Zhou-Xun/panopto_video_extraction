1
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:10,990
Yeah. Oh, hey, I had no idea.

2
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:23,070
Good afternoon. Yeah. Let's go ahead and get settled and start our work.

3
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:29,230
Hello. Okay.

4
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:35,920
Welcome to Episode 643 Surveillance and Publicly Available Data Sets.

5
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:46,630
And welcome to the second half of this semester. I know you've just completed at 644 and now you are here in at 643.

6
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:55,360
So I'm excited to have you here. My name is Miranda Buxton and I am going to be leading this session along with

7
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:03,480
Haiyan is her new addition who's you may have interacted with her in a piece.

8
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:10,990
644 But we are glad to have you here and we're looking forward to working with you in the next seven weeks.

9
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:21,399
So welcome again. So just the two of us, your instructional team, we will tell you a little bit about our interests,

10
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:26,440
our training and what we are currently doing in terms of research.

11
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,730
But before that, I'll start with our commitment to you.

12
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:37,270
We are here to be supportive of your education, educational experience and your aspirations.

13
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:48,010
And we will be intentional about our interactions being one that's going to exemplify kindness and compassion.

14
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:52,930
So please reach out if you have questions, if you have concerns.

15
00:01:53,630 --> 00:02:01,360
We're willing to work with you. We're us in these difficult times that we are living in, and we are here to support you through this process.

16
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:11,980
Please be proactive. If you have concerns that you want to reach out about rather than, you know, it being after a particular assessment is due.

17
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,350
So we're here and willing to work with you.

18
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:24,910
So in terms of my training, I have training in environmental science, which I completed at Queens College in New York.

19
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:33,090
Anybody here from New York? No New New Yorkers in the house, anyway.

20
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:44,739
And then I also completed my MBA, just as you are doing now in the same space at the School of Public Health here at the Ph.D. I completed,

21
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:53,200
also here at the school and then postdoctoral training in nutrition sciences, in the sciences department.

22
00:02:53,620 --> 00:03:00,310
So I've been around here for a little bit, but definitely I've had the experience that you are going through now.

23
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:05,050
I must admit that was without whole there. So it was a little bit different.

24
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,460
But we are glad to have you here and looking forward to working with you.

25
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:16,060
So in terms of my research interests, I am interested in maternal and child health,

26
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:21,190
global health and then also public health in low resource settings.

27
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:30,610
And for some of you, you might be wondering what exactly is that working in low resource settings require additional skills.

28
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:37,870
You know, because we have systems in place here in the U.S. where we can collect data,

29
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:47,650
we have surveillance systems that allow us to collect data on a routine basis, and they are publicly available as we are going to see in this course.

30
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:56,709
But some of these other settings, you have challenges in addition to conducting public health research in these areas.

31
00:03:56,710 --> 00:04:03,970
So I have a specific interest in working in these areas to address some of the public health needs.

32
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:11,020
In terms of my focus area and address the environmental and dietary factors that

33
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:16,540
influence maternal and child health and particularly the mechanistic processes involved.

34
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:23,500
So an example will be if a person is exposed to air pollution and there are some adverse outcome.

35
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:31,570
What are some of the steps in between that exposure and the outcome that's leading to the adverse adverse effect in individuals?

36
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:42,940
Currently, I'm looking at air pollution and dietary inflammation and thinking about how those work together to influence preterm birth risk.

37
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:48,820
In terms of other info, I have a wide range of experience in study designs,

38
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:55,720
so collecting data and which includes cross-sectional cohort and experimental studies.

39
00:04:56,170 --> 00:05:03,940
So as we go through this seven, seven week period, we will be looking at available data sets,

40
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:13,570
but we'll also be thinking and talking about the considerations that we need to take when we collect data in epidemiology.

41
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:20,170
But here he is, a doctoral candidate in the epidemiology department.

42
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:26,980
She has also training in chronic disease epidemiology, which she got from Yale,

43
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:33,610
and then also a Bachelor of Science in cellular biology from the University of Wisconsin, Madison.

44
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:40,090
And if you don't mind, can you just tell a little bit about your research? I think it is coming from you.

45
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:57,660
I want to share you. You know, maybe it's like reading or something like that that I like working on the problem, but none of the.

46
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:14,030
Well, there are. And she also had a few more options for me when you have.

47
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:19,980
I mean, I saw that.

48
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:31,900
And then also I got another option where, you know, the American people are very, very, very difficult about this have.

49
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:37,420
All of our plans.

50
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:50,950
Other options that are so. Thank you.

51
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,950
And what we can do also, we can send that by email.

52
00:06:55,310 --> 00:07:02,120
So for those who are now year two, they can have it and people can remember how you like to do your.

53
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:08,250
Thank you. It's. All right.

54
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,870
So the course goals,

55
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:20,100
we are looking forward to having you get the information that will help you understand how we collect basic surveillance data that

56
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:29,100
we use throughout our epidemiology and to understand the variety and breadth of publicly available data for epidemiologic research.

57
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:37,440
And then finally, to give you information to know how to access and use these different data sources for any of the

58
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,870
data sources that we will cover would take more than a semester to become truly familiar with that.

59
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:52,410
But we will give you information and go over some exercises that will help you to help introduce you to these different data sources.

60
00:07:53,100 --> 00:08:04,739
If your eventual career goal lead you to working on some of these datasets, you will have at least an overview of where to go and what types of data.

61
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:13,500
I have that. So for the course structure, we have readings that will be assigned for some weeks, some weeks.

62
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:19,110
We have no readings assigned for grades associated with this course.

63
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:26,340
You have three quizzes that you will complete on canvas, each with is worth 20% of your total grade.

64
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:35,160
The quizzes will be taking out of class time, so quizzes will be available for weeks four, five and seven.

65
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:47,130
The quizzes will open 50 minutes after class ends, and they are due on Friday, the Friday after the opening by 1159.

66
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:52,890
Feel free to use your notes or any other resources if you want to check on the internet.

67
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:57,480
I'll feel free to use those resources as you complete your courses.

68
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:06,210
And then as a final group project, which is worth 40% of the final grade and this will be interviews with three.

69
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:10,920
From there, you will be working with your group members. You start on a group project.

70
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:24,550
Any questions about a course structure? In terms of the schedule today, we are going to cover U.S. Census data.

71
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:33,100
Next week will be by the statistics. The following week will be in Haines and then you'll get an introduction to the group project.

72
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:46,330
The week of the 15. You get breakfast and then that after class that day you have your first place open and it's due that Friday, November 18.

73
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:52,810
And then for the week of Thanksgiving, we have the Demographic and Health Survey Program.

74
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:58,899
I know sometimes people travel and would like to have that flexibility.

75
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:04,090
So this particular session would be online to accommodate people who will be traveling.

76
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:13,960
So if you are already at your location, you'll still be able to participate because it will all be online for that particular session.

77
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:22,480
We will record all of these sessions. So for somebody who's not able to attend, they can watch the session and after.

78
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:27,940
Then for questions you wish would have been to the 25th that Friday.

79
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:36,999
But that's right after Thanksgiving. So is extended to the following Monday to give you time to be in a moment of at Thanksgiving.

80
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
And then you can submit this on Monday.

81
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:48,810
And then the 29th you have chronic disease surveillance and then the last class will be infectious disease surveillance.

82
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:56,749
And that Friday, December 9th, you have Quest three and the final project.

83
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:00,010
Do you any questions about the schedule?

84
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:15,460
Right. So for office hours I'm available by appointment and hanging on explained that she's available on Mondays 12 to 1 p.m. And in all those days

85
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:23,850
she will send you an email to give you a sense of how you can either make an appointment to meet with her or utilize one of these little.

86
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:29,800
Office hours will be held on zoom. The link is already here.

87
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:38,610
On this slide is also on the canvas site in case you want quick access and the passport is epic.

88
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:48,370
So plan for today we will introduce briefly surveillance who showed you an overview of the

89
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:56,130
U.S. Census data and then you will work on our group exercise utilizing the census data.

90
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:05,210
So when we think of surveillance, what do you think of what comes to mind when you hear surveillance?

91
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:12,930
One of the some of the first thoughts that come to mind.

92
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:21,760
I think there are likely to be more. Is were.

93
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:31,070
Exactly. Thank you. Yes. So for surveillance, we are thinking about data collection,

94
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:40,910
but the key parts of that data collection process is that this process is ongoing, ongoing data analysis, but it's just not restricted.

95
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:47,629
I think default when we think surveillance, we're thinking just data collection, but it also includes analysis,

96
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:56,150
interpretation of the data and then making the data available to those who need to do what public health requires,

97
00:12:56,510 --> 00:13:01,070
so to inform practitioners and also to inform the public.

98
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:06,200
And because this process is ongoing, once we collect data, we inform programs,

99
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:10,760
and then we'll continue to collect data to evaluate how well those programs are working.

100
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:16,040
So it's an ongoing practice that informs and.

101
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:26,000
Helps us to enforce public health practice and policy.

102
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:31,320
So this is just a visual of that definition on how you have data collection.

103
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:41,440
You analyze the data, interpret, disseminate information, inform public health practice, and then you continue again with the collection of data.

104
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:50,320
So the next thing we're going to talk about is the U.S. Census data for health research.

105
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:57,340
So the U.S. Census Data Program, they collect data every ten years.

106
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:03,340
The first census was done in 1790. So we've done 23 censuses so far.

107
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:10,210
The most recent being the one done in 2020. And this is a process that's mandated by the U.S. Constitution.

108
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:19,990
And so I I guess a lot of people don't realize this, that refusing or neglecting to answer the census is punishable by fines.

109
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:23,800
So if you get one of those forms, make sure you complete them.

110
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:34,570
And in terms of how these data are used, they're used to determine in the pocket of congressional seats, just states.

111
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:41,500
They are used to define districts, Wolf, legislative and school district assignment areas.

112
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:49,840
They're used for planning decisions for community services and a range of other factors, including public health.

113
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:57,400
So as you see on this list, and it's almost in order of priority, public health is all the way at the bottom of the list.

114
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:04,900
So the primary purpose of collecting census data, it's not really for public health purposes, but they are available.

115
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:11,620
They're useful data that we can tap into. So we have access to those data to inform public health measures.

116
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:15,010
But the primary reason is not for public health.

117
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:25,360
And because we're in public health, we need to think about how we can utilize this data while acknowledging the limitations of the data.

118
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:34,210
What will be some of the challenges of using data for public health that were not intended for public health purposes?

119
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:56,860
Any thoughts? So if if these data are just generated because of other purposes.

120
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:02,230
So the questions are going to be asked with no particular preference for public health context,

121
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:09,130
the data or the question is not going to be designed by public health officials.

122
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:21,100
And so we are using available data and we need to be mindful that these data have limitations and to interpret our data based on those limitations.

123
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:31,800
So the data are collected every ten years. So we know there are many things that can happen within that ten year time frame.

124
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:38,520
So we're capturing a snapshot of what's happening with the population every ten years.

125
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:42,360
So we need to also be thinking about what are we missing?

126
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:48,660
What unique features are happening within those ten year period?

127
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:53,670
To then think, What are we missing? What's happening out?

128
00:16:53,970 --> 00:17:04,080
But it's how we are collecting the data and what other information we could potentially get from other sources as part of the census program.

129
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:13,740
There's the American Community Survey. So is the U.S. and its ongoing survey that samples a small percent of the population every year.

130
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:20,850
So this is very useful for the census, even though it's widespread and comprehensive in terms of coverage.

131
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:26,490
It's not comprehensive in terms of the number of questions that are asked on the survey.

132
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:31,680
So the American Community Survey tends to a smaller segment in the population,

133
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:37,960
but they collect comprehensive information in terms of the population, housing, income.

134
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:44,490
And you will see an exercise that we will do today that they're studying information you can get from the census data set,

135
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:50,160
and then certain types of information that you will have to go to the American community survey to be able to find.

136
00:17:51,690 --> 00:18:02,070
There are other surveys associated with the census program, but they are not frequently used as the census data or the American Community Survey.

137
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:13,270
So this is a sample of what the census form looked like in 1850.

138
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:20,140
So that was around 60 years after the program was introduced.

139
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:27,819
So you see they have just limited information, which is not too far off from what we're collecting.

140
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:33,610
But now we have more categories in terms of race and some of the other questions that asked.

141
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:39,570
So this form has information on the age sex color.

142
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:47,470
That was the way it was described on the form occupation and also place of birth.

143
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:55,450
So this is what the form looked like in 1850. This first standardized form was used was 1830.

144
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:59,080
And then by 1850, they had added additional questions.

145
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:08,080
By 1970, the form now started looking like this with more information about race.

146
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:10,780
So additional categories were added.

147
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:22,000
And this is helpful because it allows people to be able to select the race that closely aligns with what they want to report.

148
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:30,370
But thinking in terms of data collection, how could this be a problem if you want to use data for multiple censuses?

149
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:39,570
Yes, but the measures are. You just from.

150
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:45,350
Survey questionnaires are. Exactly.

151
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:48,739
So if you are using data for one census,

152
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:56,180
you have fun because you have all of the variables appearing across the forms or the participants in the dataset.

153
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:03,650
But if you are doing some analysis where you want to look at the census from 1960, 1970, you know,

154
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:12,830
you start having problems because now you have additional questions or additional categories that you don't have across forms.

155
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:21,460
So it's going to be a challenge trying to combine the data in a way that you can report information on the race.

156
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:29,510
So you have to either go back and try to reduce the categories to match your previous years so you'll be able to analyze your data.

157
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:35,540
So those are some of the challenges you would encounter if you want to use the census data,

158
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:40,550
particularly if you want to use the across multiple data collection points.

159
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:46,720
And then for the 2020 census, this is what the form looked like.

160
00:20:48,490 --> 00:21:01,180
You had, I think, about nine questions on the questionnaire asking about people living in whom contact information and in the policy type.

161
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:08,890
And then as the second part of the forum. So very limited set of questions.

162
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:13,720
But that makes sense. Imagine you're trying to collect data on the entire population.

163
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:23,410
So it's very convenient and makes sense both for the census program and also for those completing the survey to

164
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:30,130
have basic and very limited questions rather than trying to collect detailed information on the entire population.

165
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:39,810
And if you're interested in looking at how the census forms have changed over time, you can visit this link.

166
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:43,709
And you are going to be able to see all of the question.

167
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:53,010
Years. All the years. So there was a point where there was a short and long census form.

168
00:21:53,910 --> 00:22:00,510
In 1980, the decennial census had a subset of the population complete the long form.

169
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:08,640
Again, when you're collecting data, you want to be effective and efficient in terms of resources.

170
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:12,720
So only a subset of the population received the long form.

171
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:19,020
The short form was the one that was intended for everybody to receive, and it was just basic questions on age,

172
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:26,730
sex, race, Hispanic origin, and then household honor versus rental status.

173
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:35,310
The long form had more detailed information on housing characteristics, population income and a range of other factors.

174
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:41,950
Over the years, the long form became the American Community Survey beginning 2000.

175
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:51,180
And so this form is administered to around 3500 I'm sorry, 3.5 million individuals every year.

176
00:22:52,200 --> 00:23:00,660
And it's not the same group of people. It's just a random sample that's selected and the form is administered to those individuals.

177
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:06,720
And then from here, we're able to get detailed information, which you will see when you complete the exercise today.

178
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:13,720
So this is just a summary to give you a sense of the data collected.

179
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:18,760
So imagine the census form has around ten, 9 to 10 questions.

180
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:27,610
The American Community Survey has information on the population, so citizenship, education, fertility,

181
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:37,060
income, and then also housing characteristics or any number of bedrooms in the house heating fuel type.

182
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:47,680
Just very detailed information that would just be time consuming and very costly if that were attempted to be collected on the.

183
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:55,640
Census form. So you might be wondering how do we access the census data?

184
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:02,030
The data are available in aggregate form on the Census Bureau website.

185
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:08,930
We are going to be using a platform that will allow us to access the data today.

186
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:18,470
And then for accessing the data. Individuals will not have access to any individual level data,

187
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:24,889
but there's a 72 year rule where in the US government would not release any personally

188
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:30,320
identifiable information about an individual to any other individual agency.

189
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:36,620
And you might be wondering why 72 years? Any thoughts on why the time frame is 72 years?

190
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:50,510
I'm sorry. Yes. So they are so mean that, you know, at the time this was done, that after 72 years,

191
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:57,200
it will be a reasonable lifespan for individuals contributing to the census.

192
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:06,730
But data are still protected by. Not releasing any individual level data to the public.

193
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:13,120
Right. So, no, that none of these data sets that we're going to cover today.

194
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:24,580
So what it be it be a census or in case of workers, no publicly, personally identifiable information is ever released to the public.

195
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:31,360
So this is something to to know if you complete any of these surveys to know that your information would not be made publicly available.

196
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:41,320
But keep in mind that some of the Web servers that we're going to cover in this class, they include de-identified individual level data.

197
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:52,180
So that's a difference. Personally identifiable individual data, meaning your maybe Social Security number name address would not be available.

198
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:57,820
But the idea that if I data where there's a line that corresponds to an individual

199
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:03,880
but you have no way to identify which individual virtual that data line applies to.

200
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:10,300
So what NHANES for first ish as a vital statistics, these are all data sets that we won't cover.

201
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:16,380
You can't get de-identified individual level data for the census data.

202
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:21,070
You will get aggregate data to use.

203
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:29,980
So we will be using Social Explorer. And this is a website that we as.

204
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:35,720
Students or faculty associated with the University of Michigan will have access to

205
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:43,020
you will need to be able to log in using a U of M credentials to access the site.

206
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:47,640
And for those who might be interested in using this further,

207
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:53,969
the Clark Library has plus offline school can help you understand how to use a social

208
00:26:53,970 --> 00:27:01,000
explorer if you wanted to do a project using the data available on social explorer.

209
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:09,620
So what are some of the ways that we can use this census data for the types of research

210
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:16,030
that we're doing in epidemiology so we can use the census data for standardization.

211
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:26,510
So you may have learned in your AP courses that sometimes you want to compare more than one population and they have different age structures.

212
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:36,510
And if you try making comparisons across those populations, you might not be doing so correctly because of the structure.

213
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:37,430
They are so different.

214
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:44,660
So most times when you have very different age structures between two populations, there's a thinner population that you do use.

215
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:50,600
In this case, we are able to use a of population based on the data we collect from the census.

216
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:55,880
And we can use that to do estimate ization. So that's one of the questions in your exercise today.

217
00:27:56,780 --> 00:28:06,980
And so best in a population will allow us to use the US population rather than using a specific states or a specific county for our population.

218
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:17,210
And then what did they don't collect from census? From the census program, we are able to have denominators for our population based events.

219
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:21,860
So we have COVID 19 and we've been trying to calculate rates.

220
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:26,360
And this is how we have the denominators that we use in those calculations.

221
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:31,100
What's the mortality rates associated with certain conditions?

222
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:35,930
This is how we are able to get those denominators for those calculations.

223
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:41,390
Then we also have the ability to project regarding diseases.

224
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:46,850
And we still are able to use those based on the data we collect from the census program.

225
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:53,990
And then for those of you who are social epidemiologist or interesting social epi,

226
00:28:54,560 --> 00:29:01,370
you know that we have the opportunity to look at neighborhood level characteristics in relation to the risk of disease.

227
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:05,660
So we are able to use census data to look at poverty,

228
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:11,840
make up for giving location and also the racial makeup and how those neighborhood

229
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:17,720
level factors influence individual individual risk of developing certain conditions.

230
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:28,490
So that so many ways that we can use epidemiology research, we can incorporate census data in the epidemiologic research that we do.

231
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:36,730
As I said earlier, we are using data that when not intended for public health purposes,

232
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:43,430
I mean, even for data that we generate a study, we go out and collect data on our own.

233
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:48,830
We have some limitations associated with those studies that we design ourselves.

234
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:54,290
So keep in mind that we're limited in terms of how those questions were asked.

235
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:58,910
If you were doing a study that you designed on your own,

236
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:07,880
most likely you would train your research team and you would test how the questions will be asked among your research team members.

237
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:15,440
But this is not how the census program operates, so we are limited by how the questions were asked.

238
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:24,500
We are also limited by how the questions have changed over time and how we can utilize data for multiple censuses.

239
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:31,910
But within the census, we are okay with the racial categories that are available in that particular survey.

240
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:41,780
The data collected every ten years. So we need to be mindful about what could possibly be missing in the data that we are using.

241
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:50,209
We do have data on the American community survey, so sometimes we can use that to kind of give us a sense of how things are changing

242
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:54,380
because these data collected on a yearly basis for the American Community Survey,

243
00:30:55,850 --> 00:31:00,140
the census tends to undercount certain population groups.

244
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:06,260
So we need to be mindful about if we're using these groups as our denominator for certain rates,

245
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:11,420
that we are calculating how if our estimates could be affected.

246
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:16,669
And then keep in mind that the units used for the census programs, source,

247
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:22,460
census blobs, census tracts, they are not based on anything that's specific to health.

248
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:30,080
So they are convenient for the census program and they're using those units for their data collection purposes.

249
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:39,930
And I said earlier that these decisions about the census program, they are not informed by health researchers.

250
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:43,430
We don't have a say. So we get what we get.

251
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:47,930
We utilize it the best way possible. And we acknowledge that there are limitations.

252
00:31:48,410 --> 00:32:03,530
And that's okay. Another limitation of the census program is that we have no category to be able to distinguish Middle Eastern or North Africa.

253
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:09,550
So even though the racial categories have increase in extent over time,

254
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:16,270
at this point, there's no separate category yet for Middle East and North African.

255
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:27,790
Even in the most recent census. And then there's still just male female categories on the census form.

256
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:33,940
So hopefully with time, this is going to change because we've seen change happening slowly over time.

257
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:39,850
So these are just some of the limitations that are associated with the census program.

258
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:48,170
So we conclude that the census program is very, very important to what we're doing.

259
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:55,550
Epidemiologic research is one of our best and most reliable sources of data on the U.S. population.

260
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,769
But there are limitations.

261
00:32:57,770 --> 00:33:07,760
And once we are able to adjust by account or at least discuss in our papers how a given limitation might affect what we're reporting,

262
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:15,350
then it allows us to utilize the data to the best of our ability, yet acknowledging the limitations.

263
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:30,230
Any questions about the Census program? So we'll go next to the U.S. Census exercise.

264
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:40,670
If you go to the assignment page on canvas, you should be able to go to assignments and then click on in class.

265
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:48,110
Exercise number one. Or if you have this PowerPoint opening, this link should get you to the exercise.

266
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:57,050
So answer the questions using Social Explorer and then you can create groups based on the table you are working at.

267
00:33:57,470 --> 00:34:02,510
And don't worry about whether your grade shows that you submitted this assignment.

268
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:08,300
It's more to do a hands on activity to be familiar with the census program.

269
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:13,970
And the reason why I want you to submit because they know where I can take a look at the group assignments.

270
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:23,480
And then next week, before we start the new material, I'll just highlight any incorrect answers that seem to be running across groups.

00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:31,840
So if you're working groups, I would need to create every single one to be able to follow Haiyan and I will have to check all of those.

272
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:37,940
But if you do groups, then we can quickly check and then bring to your attention anything that seems to be off across the groups.

273
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:44,480
Okay. So this link here will get you to a social explorer.

274
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:51,130
And if you click on that, you should get something that looks like this and this link, right?

275
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,980
Social Explorer here in blue is the hyperlink. If you click on that,

276
00:34:55,610 --> 00:35:08,450
you should get a page that looks like this and you or you might get you will then log in window if you have recently logged in and you should,

277
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:20,150
I think log in. You have something that looks like this, your screen, and then you can use the questions to help you navigate the exercise.

278
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:26,300
Keep in mind, this is a rough guide to exploring a data set.

279
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:32,089
You will have to play around a little bit to get some of the answers because this is

280
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:37,700
almost what you would do if you were looking for information on the census website.
