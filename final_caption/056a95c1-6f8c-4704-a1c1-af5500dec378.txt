1
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:17,700
Yeah. Okay. So I think you little four points here.

2
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:24,510
Hey. Good morning, everyone. It's so nice to see you all.

3
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:28,470
I feel like I miss you. It's been, like, all week since I've been here. My apologies.

4
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:34,440
It's hard to say. It's really nice walking into the classroom and seeing like, the sun hanging again.

5
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,060
And it's actually not freezing in here relative to the outdoors.

6
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:43,649
So a nice, cozy classroom day. Let's see.

7
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:48,420
I wanted to start with just reflecting on the on the course schedule.

8
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:59,010
We don't have much further to go right here we are on the 22nd, no class on Thursday as I hope everyone's fully aware and probably looking forward to.

9
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:09,540
And then we come back with only four sessions remaining after the break, the last three of which will include our team debates.

10
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,320
And so I wanted to start with that just with questions.

11
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:16,410
Since our our debates are not too far away,

12
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:23,410
we will have some time at the end of the class period today to convene and to breakout groups with your debate teams.

13
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:30,330
And I just wanted to offer up and see if there are any questions at this point regarding the debate assignment,

14
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:33,960
operations, coordination, logistics, whatever it might be.

15
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:45,570
Yes. When Michael was meeting, we were talking about how to cite sources and if we're turning anything in to you.

16
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:51,270
I know I obviously like if we're not, I might just use the URL always in my thinking.

17
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:58,739
Sure, sure. Great question. And actually, I think I have a couple of different answers based on your your question.

18
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:04,740
It prompted me to think of a few things, so I don't recall if it's in the assignment description.

19
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:16,770
I think it is. But if not, I'll clarify. Now I will ask each debate team on your debate date to send me a copy of your presentation.

20
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:25,910
Whether it's, you know, Google slides, PowerPoint, whatever you're using, uh, whether it's cloud, you know, share it with me.

21
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:30,650
If not, attach it on an email or whatever, but email it to me, please.

22
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:40,640
So that's that's the first part. The second part is, yes, you should probably site your work rate within your presentation.

23
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,620
URLs are fine.

24
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:50,120
I would say kind of like the proposal, whatever format you prefer to pick one and just use it consistently throughout your presentation.

25
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:56,690
I think it's really common to have a slide at the end that's like a, you know, a listing of all the references or all the URL.

26
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:01,660
Uh, and that's, that's completely fine. Does that answer your question?

27
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:07,900
Okay. But also I reminded me to it's a good point to say that I am expecting you all to, to, uh,

28
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:16,100
not just actually turn in your, uh, your slides, but even to manage the logistics of the classroom.

29
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,860
It'll, it'll go faster.

30
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:24,890
You can either send it to me or share it with me in advance so that as I'm up here kind of prepping the start of the class period,

31
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:32,210
I can pull up those files and have them ready so that we don't have to do a bunch of logging in and logging out and uh,

32
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,229
uh, better efficient use of time. Good question.

33
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:43,850
Any others? Yes, I just was looking at the description again, the students scoring forms that were supposed to turn in.

34
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:48,200
If you want us to print those out before, do you have a good question?

35
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:51,530
So another component of that is that if you recall,

36
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:59,750
your the grade that you'll receive for the debate assignment is kind of a hybrid part of it's going to be my evaluation.

37
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,920
And I there's a rubric in there for what to show you what I'll be using to evaluate.

38
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:15,930
There's also a peer evaluation, so everyone else on your debate team will submit a score and score you individually that'll get submitted to me.

39
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:22,399
So similarly, on the day of your debate where you plan to just email me, you don't have to print it.

40
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,560
Email me your scoring sheet. I've directed your team members.

41
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:40,950
These are great questions. Thank you. It prompts me to speak about the things that I don't recall on my own.

42
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:46,500
Any other questions? Yeah.

43
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:47,170
So.

44
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:56,920
So in terms of what the grading like who wins the debate, that's just a it's based off of us raising our hands, saying who we think did a better job.

45
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,020
Yeah, but that's not actually part of the grade. Oh, it will.

46
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:04,020
We'll get into, uh, this is more of the, the fun part.

47
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,810
Perhaps it's the kick off to our discussion.

48
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:15,690
So once we're done with the formal debates and rebuttals, uh, we'll be able to kind of reconvene as a class just by a show of hands.

49
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:24,150
I'm not counting them. Just by a show of hands. We'll see who won the debate, which is you did a better job of making a case.

50
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:34,349
Right, for their for their assigned topic. And then we'll do another a second show of hands to see who's actually for or against the topic.

51
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:37,440
And this is weighing in with your own opinion about how you feel about the topic.

52
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:41,340
And then we can have some just some open discussion about the topic.

53
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:48,520
But none of those, you know, class boats actually weighing it.

54
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:56,540
It's part of the grading. Any other questions you have?

55
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,670
Mr. Do you prefer a more like a fact based approach?

56
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:05,230
Or how do you feel about like ethos? What's the emotional one?

57
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:12,490
Like emotional appeal being involved? Yeah. Yeah. So, uh, so definitely fact based.

58
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:18,370
That's the foundation of your case, right? Is is absolutely fact based.

59
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:23,440
You all are also, uh, I don't want to say emerging.

60
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,510
You're kind of emerging expertise, right, in these exposure environmental health issues.

61
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:32,290
And so, you know, your debate team can weigh in.

62
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:37,450
And even if you can't find a fact that says exactly what you want to say,

63
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,800
this is your this is what you do as scientists, is that you synthesize information.

64
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:45,700
Right. And put together pieces to actually say what you think should be said.

65
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:50,499
And that's also fine. And then, yes, there's for some of these there's a lot of other considerations, right.

66
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,500
Societal immunity, you know, whatever it is.

67
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:57,490
So so don't be afraid to to bring those into your argument.

68
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:01,690
If you think it helps to support your case. Does that answer your question?

69
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:08,940
Thank you. Yeah. Any other.

70
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:17,360
This is great. So. So what do like what does the rebuttal look look like?

71
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:21,930
So when it says you have 2 minutes to confer and 2 minutes to give an oral rebuttal later,

72
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:31,020
is that just like the pro versus the or the the against or like how is that how does that actually translate into.

73
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:39,870
Sure. So I'll walk through the logistics of it and then see if you have a follow up question, which is, is this worthwhile to do?

74
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:49,020
So after let's say on December 1st, I will actually give a short lecture on indoor air quality issues and then we'll stop and I'll say,

75
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:57,809
okay, let's go ahead and start the debate. I'll invite the, uh, the four pro group up and everyone will physically walk up here.

76
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:01,379
Right. You'll be presenting. I'll go sit down. The floor will be yours.

77
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:08,760
You can display everything on the, on the screen. Um, and I'll have a timer, and it's going to be like an exact 10 minutes, right?

78
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,760
And I'll say whenever you're ready, go ahead and start.

79
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:19,469
And the pro group will go through there 10 minutes, say thank you very much and then we'll just do a really quick switch the program.

80
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:24,870
We'll go sit down. The against group will come up, make their presentation for 10 minutes and I'll say,

81
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:29,460
okay, each group now has 2 minutes to convene to come up with their rebuttal.

82
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:37,290
And I think it's pretty quiet of sites. We'll probably ask maybe each group to go out into separate corners of the classroom just so you

83
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:42,659
can talk in private or whatever and not have your your opponents hear what you're discussing,

84
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:46,740
perhaps. I don't know. Um, and then I'll, I'll keep track of that.

85
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:50,310
We'll stick to 2 minutes and then I want both groups back in.

86
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:56,280
And then the four group or the pro group will have 2 minutes to give their rebuttal.

87
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:01,640
And then the against group will have 2 minutes to give their rebuttal.

88
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:06,710
Just based on in the past, I can offer up what that looks like.

89
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:17,480
Very often it's just people that have collected their thoughts and said and then maybe even picked a certain person to give the full rebuttal.

90
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:21,179
Or if you want to share it, it's completely up to you how you want to break up your time.

91
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:25,340
But just be just realize you only have 2 minutes to give that rebuttal.

92
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,680
Some groups do some. What's. What would be the word?

93
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:33,580
Some. Uh. Uh.

94
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:41,270
Some some self-critique. Right. So you know what you are presenting.

95
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:49,190
But but if you can critique yourself, you might know where the weaknesses are in your team's argument and you might kind of

96
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:56,840
anticipate what the what the other group is going to be rebutting or critiquing you for.

97
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:01,400
So you might actually prepare a material in advance in anticipation of that.

98
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:04,309
It's not necessary at all. So that helps you.

99
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:09,770
You can kind of build some back up slides or something like that if you want to be able to show a slide or something.

100
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:15,620
There won't be time to show a bunch, but if it helps to have a slide as part of your rebuttal,

101
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:18,830
and if you just want to have it as a backup, you can you could absolutely do that.

102
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,150
It's not required.

103
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:31,760
But that's just some examples of what I've been debating or not responding to, like a question that the other debate team is giving us.

104
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:37,910
So, no, you are well, you are responding to their critiques.

105
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:48,110
Okay. Right. So the first group is saying we should do this and the next group is getting up and saying we should not do this.

106
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:55,040
And they're giving reasons. And if you're in the pro group, you're going to give a rebuttal and say, okay, we didn't address this in our presentation,

107
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:01,380
but the points that the Guns team just made about this, that and the other are flawed for this reason.

108
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:13,160
Right. You know, that would be an example of a robot. Any other questions?

109
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:27,520
All right. So I know that without a few people to do a quick count, we know how many groups to break up into four.

110
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:33,850
Yes. I mean. 19.

111
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:38,260
Of course, it doesn't work out. Exactly. So let's see if we do.

112
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:46,630
Five groups of four. And only one group is going to have three.

113
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:52,629
I'll let you guys self-select, turn to the folks nearest you, perhaps groups of four,

114
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:57,790
and we'll go ahead and start with our with our East and the news discussion for today.

115
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:30,220
One, two, three, go. Don't feel that this is more people than I really thought I was speaking.

116
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:39,280
Everything that people are saying that they be cured in the standards. It's like, all right, let's go ahead and reconvene.

117
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:47,060
Yeah, he's not eating. So they just I notice we ended up with one group with five that did somebody not could think of group.

118
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:53,050
You made it through all of them. She's in the middle of a sentence. Well, it's all good.

119
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:58,650
Yeah. All right, so we've got one, two, three, four, five groups.

120
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:04,390
So let's do just as we have in the past previously with this assignment or group activity.

121
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:12,549
Let's go through with each group. Right. And perhaps maybe the most the most interesting article you can go ahead and report out.

122
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:16,540
Maybe we'll start on this side and kind of work our way across the group over here.

123
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:24,570
Yeah. So I found an article that was more looking at a positive exposure.

124
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:30,040
So the article assignments about newborns being exposed to different really biological agents.

125
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:36,520
And it really kind of started off with the fact that I think around 7 million probably more at this point,

126
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:42,640
children in the US have asthma or some type of allergy, which is like there's a lot of children.

127
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:50,800
So this article is talking about newborns exposed in their first year of life to certain biological agents.

128
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:57,250
So they compared children who grew up on farms versus children who grow up in cities.

129
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:03,940
And then even within the city, they compared children who grew up in a more like sterile and I guess clean environment

130
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:10,650
as opposed to children who are exposed to different types of like dander and again,

131
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:14,650
other biological agents that could be present in their home.

132
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:19,960
So. Right. They found that in the first year of life that children are exposed to all of these

133
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:25,509
biological agents were significantly less likely to experience like wheezing,

134
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:28,690
asthma or other allergies by age three.

135
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:32,979
But these benefits only occurred in their first year of life.

136
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:37,180
Like if they were exposed after their first year of life, they wouldn't.

137
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:44,570
Get all of those all of those benefits from being exposed to those.

138
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:47,959
That's pretty interesting. But that was the general gist of the article.

139
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:51,370
Yeah. Okay, great. Now, thanks for sharing. So that one's interesting, right?

140
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:57,110
Because, I mean, as you recall, part of your assignment was to consider at the end opportunities for exposure control.

141
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:03,500
So in this case, I mean, I guess you can still consider it a control, but it would be a positive.

142
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:07,969
Exactly. But, you know, supposing a purpose. Right. So interesting.

143
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:10,369
Yeah. So that's it's a little bit outside of my area,

144
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:17,710
but I'm familiar with there's been this long running hygiene hypothesis, right, for probably 20 years or more now,

145
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:26,530
but with the basic premise that, uh, immune system development is apparently really sensitive to exposures and very early life.

146
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:32,060
Right? I think originally it was like the first two years, but the article you're talking about is saying that it's really the first year.

147
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:39,980
Right? And that that kind of redirects the immune system and has that plays an important role in whether subsequent asthma is developed or not.

148
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:44,960
Really interesting. Thank you so much for sharing. Let's go to the the group in the back corner here.

149
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:58,110
Um, so the article that I looked at is from the New York Times and it's about a major recall on CPAP machines, if you're not familiar.

150
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:04,520
CPAP stands for continuous positive airway pressure, and it's used for people with sleep apnea.

151
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:08,570
It's like that mask thing that you wear to bed so that you can breathe.

152
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:22,520
And apparently Philips Rusk for Onyx back in 2015 was aware that a foam that they used in their machines to help dampen the sound and vibrations,

153
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:28,009
which we know are also exposures, was actually degrading.

154
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:35,540
And the language used in the article is that it was breaking off into black flecks and blowing into the mouths and noses of users.

155
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:39,380
So they they knew that this was happening, but they didn't do anything about it.

156
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:50,780
But eventually, in April 2021, the company found out that these flaking foam particles contained potentially cancer causing chemicals,

157
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,320
which led to a major medical device recall.

158
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:59,180
And so it's now been a year and a half since that recall happened.

159
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:04,340
And like, millions of Americans are still waiting for new machines because as we know,

160
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:10,070
there's like a lot of issues with manufacturing and everything's kind of behind right now in the supply chain.

161
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:18,530
So they gave an example of a woman who started using the CPAP machine in 2018 and developed a cough.

162
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:27,560
And then in 2020, she was diagnosed with an aggressive lung cancer that, quote, baffled her doctors and she passed away within a year.

163
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:35,780
There have been more than 69,000 complaints to the sent to the company about cancer, difficulty breathing, chest pain.

164
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:39,060
And there's been 168 reports of death.

165
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:48,830
But again, it's impossible to know for sure if that's a direct correlation or not as far as the chemicals involved here.

166
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:55,429
Degraded foam reveals the presence of chemicals like told you because I mean tell you in dry

167
00:17:55,430 --> 00:18:02,180
society diethylene glycol and boxes and if you're not if none of those sound familiar to you,

168
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:05,660
diethylene glycol is used in like antifreeze.

169
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,330
So that's one thing that you would see.

170
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:19,880
And then there are two compounds in particular that have like toxic carcinogenic effects that are considered above the standard safety limits.

171
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,940
So all that to say this is a chemical exposure, the root is inhalation,

172
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:32,420
but it could also be considered ingestion since it's going through the mouth, the pathways through the breathing machine.

173
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:38,930
As far as exposure assessment goes, I'm guessing I don't do too much research into it,

174
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:46,790
but I'm guessing you could probably do some kind of biomarker to see if any of these different compounds are present in your body,

175
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:53,570
but also, if possible, to just test the actual foam in your machine or just test the machine itself.

176
00:18:54,830 --> 00:19:03,320
As far as exposure control, they did mention that the degradation of this foam occurs faster in humid or hot settings.

177
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:07,100
So if you decrease the humidity in your home, maybe that will help.

178
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:13,430
But also there just needs to be better quality control for the actual manufacturers that are making these machines.

179
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:18,949
Yeah. Thanks for sharing. And you're right. I can't remember.

180
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:22,670
You mentioned the number of how many people are using these or.

181
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:30,200
I don't have a number of how many people are using, but at least a million like millions of Americans, are still waiting for new machines.

182
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:34,040
So it's been like a major, widely utilized decade.

183
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:39,800
You said that decreasing humidity, was that a suggestion in the article or is that one you in the article?

184
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:46,220
Okay. I just thought that was interesting because CPAP machines use water in the mirror.

185
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:53,150
So how are you going to like decreasing your house? I think it's maybe.

186
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:56,230
I don't know. I don't know. It sounds questionable.

187
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,500
It's degrading when it's just sitting there, like during the daytime or something like that.

188
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:12,970
That's terrible. Yeah, thanks. Thanks for sharing. And I also I recalled in, I think as we were talking about exposure controls and examples, right.

189
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:18,260
When you were coming up with examples of somebody mentioned recalls.

190
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:26,420
Right. And so this would, I think, be an example of like an administrative level of exposure control through the recall mechanism.

191
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:34,470
Thank you so much. Let's come up to the group in the front here of I did a chemical exposure.

192
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:45,930
So in the Pacific Northwest Puget Sound, there is a chemical coming from tires that is impacting fish there.

193
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:55,440
So in the early 2000, Barb French, a researcher, kind of observed this unexplainable phenomenon happening with coho salmon.

194
00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:04,590
When the fish returned to their natal streams to spawn, which is a point in their life cycle when they should be typically in really good health.

195
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:12,440
They behaved very strangely. They would swim to the banks, really disoriented, swimming sideways.

196
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:17,520
They lost their sense of direction. Their mouths would be gaped open towards the water surface.

197
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:27,900
And within a few hours, they would die. So just last year, a group of Washington researchers pinpointed this cause as six PPD,

198
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:32,370
which is a chemical that's put into tires to prevent them from breaking down.

199
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:39,059
So when six PPD reacts with ozone in the atmosphere, it creates six PPD.

200
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,379
Quinones Or six PPD.

201
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:49,380
Q Which is a compound that leaches into urban stormwater and then, of course, gets into like these bodies of water where they are now.

202
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:56,940
Also this past last year, this past year, I guess, Stephanie Blair,

203
00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:02,340
a Washington State University researcher, found some new discoveries with this issue.

204
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:14,100
So basically, as the fish develop their symptoms, their blood thickens and plasma leaks from their blood vessels into their brain tissue.

205
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:21,360
And this just is a complete breakdown in quotes of the blood brain barrier that will shut down neural function.

206
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:32,190
So, of course, research is still being, you know, under is still underway as far as like how it affects humans and other organisms.

207
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:37,500
But there's a potential for that chemical to pass up.

208
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:48,060
The food chain in Washington and California are kind of leading the nation as far as like their efforts to limit the the exposure.

209
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:55,170
Washington's trying to limit concentrations in runoff through source control, for example,

210
00:22:55,170 --> 00:23:02,990
through like street sweeping and roadside cleanup and also flow control by putting soil.

211
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:07,920
I said the last time the soil filtration columns in the soil.

212
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:19,110
And on the other hand, California is trying to classify the chemical as a priority product, which will force companies to disclose their use of it.

213
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:26,700
And then eventually, just like help us people to analyze it further and find some alternative chemicals.

214
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:36,450
Excellent. Wow. Well, thank you. I'm not familiar with I mean, I'm familiar with tire wear in general being an issue for this specific chemical.

215
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:44,580
Chemical. Did the the study, your article talk about it being in other products or is that part of just the rationale for why to

216
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:49,130
pass this initiative to further disclosure as to what to identify what other products that might be?

217
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:52,320
And they didn't mention other products.

218
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:56,650
They really just like focus on the fact that it was used from tires specifically.

219
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:04,910
Right. Right. But they also said that tire manufacturers aren't very open with disclosing what chemicals they're using.

220
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:09,240
So that's like a main. Foundry jazz from.

221
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:13,050
Okay. Yeah. Not really. Interesting article. Thank you so much for sharing.

222
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:20,730
Like that's been a I wanna say a long time and more recently recognized aspect of uh,

223
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:29,760
auto is and contributing pollutants or contaminants to the environment is, you know, everyone recognizes gasoline or diesel being burned, right.

224
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:35,250
And whatever is emitted as being a pollutant. But other aspects of automotive where.

225
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:43,079
Right. Oil, brake pads or every time the brakes are applied, it it creates like dust that's given up and then tire away, right.

226
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,809
Like new sets of tires have these deep grooves.

227
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:51,810
And then, you know, after, I don't know, a few years, depending on how much driving, you know, it's worn down.

228
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:57,240
Right. And so where did all of that go? And that's the reality is that it's in our environment.

229
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:04,560
And so but yeah, this particular chemical I was not aware of, thank you so much for sharing any any questions or comments.

230
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:12,650
Right. Well, thank you. Now, the group up here in the back.

231
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:21,470
So the articles that I looked at were about chemical exposure that happens at a swimming pool, at a YMCA and Cape Cod.

232
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:25,730
This happened like six weeks ago or so.

233
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:31,399
So this pool at this y, they're like automatic chemical fitter to clean.

234
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:38,390
The pool was broken and they had been trying to contact the company to fix it and no one was coming to fix it.

235
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:42,290
Obviously, you still have to clean your swimming pool. People want to use it.

236
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:46,789
So there is like alternative methods to doing that other than just like a

237
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:52,070
constant like chemical feeding system or used dump in like granular chlorine,

238
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:57,260
then like wait a certain amount of time if you have to add anything else like added after which

239
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:03,050
you're only ever supposed to do that when the pool is closed just in case anything could happen.

240
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:13,370
So one day, unfortunately, they added hydrochloric acid to the pool while people were swimming in it.

241
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:22,250
So they had added the chlorine in the morning, like when it was closed, like they were supposed to, but it must not have fully dissolved or something.

242
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:27,360
They added hydrochloric acid. It's like the next step in the cleaning process.

243
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:33,860
You mix chlorine tablets really are chlorine and you mix hydrochloric acid.

244
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:37,940
You make chlorine gas, which is obviously very dangerous.

245
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:43,340
There are seven kids that were swimming in the deep end, like where all this stuff was going in.

246
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:46,880
They all ended up going to the hospital. They're all totally fine.

247
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:53,750
They've actually all returned to the Y and are now swimming again, which is a little scary in my opinion.

248
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:59,600
But there's definitely like they got extremely lucky that like the worst that

249
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:05,120
happened is these kids got headaches and were dizzy and like drowned in the pool.

250
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:13,069
But I think that the biggest issue was like they did not follow industry standards at all because like, it is industry standards.

251
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:17,180
Like you don't add any chemicals like that while the school is open.

252
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:21,710
But unfortunately, there's also like supply chain issues.

253
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:28,370
There's worker issues where they were unable to get anybody to come do the job of fixing the system,

254
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:32,180
which then ended up with this huge catastrophe in the end.

255
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:38,900
So obviously exposure is like the air or absorption through the pool water.

256
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:45,229
Some mitigation factors that they're actually putting in place is they shut down the pool,

257
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:52,400
like to do a full investigation, and they added a more intensive training like operation that they have to go through.

258
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:57,920
So everybody now is hopefully up to speed on how to properly clean the pool.

259
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:05,659
That's something I think is interesting, is like usually when you clean up, you only ever add like dilute chlorine.

260
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:09,710
Like you have to dilute your chemicals a lot before like putting them in.

261
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:17,660
So maybe those chemicals shouldn't be sold in such concentrated levels that if it's just sold out, you'll have the concentration of what it is.

262
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:25,459
Now, the risk would be like 50% lower potentially, because it's just extremely dangerous to have all this happening,

263
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:30,830
especially when there's water and children involved. Absolutely.

264
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:35,050
Holy cow. Thank you for sharing that. That's terrible. Where. Where was this, like in Cape Cod?

265
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:40,059
Oh, my gosh. It's interesting. That doesn't seem like they're getting sued or anything.

266
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:46,920
Like some members were like, I wonder if any of the parents are going to sue the like, but it doesn't sound like they are.

267
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:51,160
Like it says all seven are back participating in swim lessons.

268
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:59,170
That's pretty interesting. They also didn't say if the person who was responsible for this got fired or not.

269
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:04,699
Which. I feel like it's an honest mistake kind of thing.

270
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:10,220
But also you probably were trained properly. Put seven children's lives at risk.

271
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:17,930
So clearly. My favorite comment when I worked at the Y, like when it was a bunch of like 16, 17,

272
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:22,220
eight year olds who were the lifeguards on duty and stuff and they were doing the water testing things outside.

273
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:27,500
I'm just assuming it might have been something younger person that's responsible for this.

274
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:31,680
And their supervisor was like he was trying to contact to get the pool fixed and they're like, but keep it open.

275
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:35,389
And you're like, Oh, I just my what is it?

276
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:39,180
Like the way it was like our first job. So maybe that was like similar for the people in.

277
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:44,090
Thanks for sharing that. Any any other questions or comments?

278
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:54,320
And it actually it makes me think it's similar in some regards to the to the article that was discussed where.

279
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:58,740
The goal is to utilize it to address a problem, right.

280
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:02,640
To prevent something bad happening health wise.

281
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:08,150
But the use of that preventative device is, you know, another problem.

282
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,600
It sounds like it's potentially worse.

283
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:15,300
And here's here's another one, right, where it's like, yeah, we need to add these chemicals so that we don't have any,

284
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:22,319
you know, levels of, you know, biologicals that might accumulate those people.

285
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,740
But making potentially likely a worse problem.

286
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:30,170
Right, are through those preventative measures. All right.

287
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:33,330
Thanks for sharing. And I think we have just one group left over here.

288
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:40,950
Yeah, so mine was from the Detroit News and the article referenced the specific study being done.

289
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:50,210
Residents of Michigan's rural counties are being residents are being found to have higher there's higher cases of that.

290
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:53,309
We know more than in more urban areas in Michigan.

291
00:30:53,310 --> 00:31:03,750
So the reference actually, this is probably due to the fact that there is lower amounts of dermatologists in more communities than in urban settings.

292
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:09,780
So like the number they gave was 38 of the state's 62 rural counties have no dermatologists at all.

293
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:14,819
And that kind of leads into the logic that if there's not a doctor available,

294
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:19,530
like within a 20 minute drive, you're less likely to go seek care regularly.

295
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:26,430
So that's that is alarming to actually reference that there's higher levels of or higher cases

296
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:31,949
of cancer across the board in rural areas in Michigan and the counties being referenced for,

297
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:37,770
you know, counties that we're all familiar with. Like, so that was alarming.

298
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:45,470
And so the exposure obviously is UV radiation from from the sun.

299
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:56,520
It's a physical exposure, pathway of exposure to sunlight, brown v dermal contact and absorption how to excess, I guess for melanoma,

300
00:31:56,520 --> 00:32:03,540
specifically skin the skin test, the presence of a sunburn can tell you if you've been exposed to radiation as well.

301
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:10,960
Checking the index for the day and what time you go outside controls would be things that people can do is PPE,

302
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:14,970
so some sunscreen, hats, rash guards and stuff like that.

303
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:25,590
And then engineering controls, access to shade. So awnings, umbrellas, things like that, increasing the number of doctors in the region, obviously,

304
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:32,399
like everyone I would assume knows that sunlight causes like melanomas, but maybe they don't know the extent of it.

305
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:40,979
So getting doctors in the area to help even better educate patients could be a way to curb that diagnosis and warnings.

306
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:47,699
So warnings about the the amount of time you're spending outside is linked to higher cases

307
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:53,610
of that and the importance of sunscreen and limiting your direct exposure in those areas.

308
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:59,550
So. Right, thank you for sharing and nice job walking through all those task assignments.

309
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:06,660
So so I'm curious and actually I want to turn this background to see if people think because I don't actually I don't actually know.

310
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:12,030
But I'm wondering like it seemed like a convenient association to make right to

311
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:17,639
point to and say there's not there not very many dermatologists in in rural areas,

312
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:22,980
and that explains it. Does anybody think there could be differences in exposure,

313
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:29,129
comparing people that live in more or maybe urban or suburban areas versus those in and rural?

314
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:32,730
Yeah. So I definitely think that could be different exposure levels.

315
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:45,480
But something I actually. Think is weird is I took that Carson Jennings class once and actually the incidence of cancer is much higher in like.

316
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:52,180
The United States versus Africa, where there's much more access to docs, doctors, doctors.

317
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:59,110
I think specifically it was like the study was looking at breast cancer where like there's like this graph like skyrockets in the US,

318
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:07,030
we're in Africa like the rate is like 1% or something, but it corresponds directly to how much testing is being done.

319
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:15,910
So it's kind of like the exact opposite of what I would have expected, where like maybe we don't really have that much more cancer.

320
00:34:15,910 --> 00:34:19,840
We have just like earlier stages of cancer that are getting found and.

321
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:26,050
It makes it seem like it's different. So I would have expected like literally the exact opposite.

322
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:34,119
Result. And I don't know if it's because in those areas where, you know, there's more farming obviously done like in those areas of Michigan.

323
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,850
So I don't know if it's they're spending that much more time outside.

324
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:44,379
And I had mentioned like literally like people are pale, you know, so could be they just like don't have that resistance against it.

325
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:53,490
So. Yeah, they just mentioned that if people are traveling, you know, longer distances, this could contribute to it and.

326
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:58,440
Yeah. Yeah. Anybody else have any opinions on this?

327
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:11,040
It's just. I really like your description of the story you shared from your previous class about.

328
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:15,270
Perhaps it's just because of more testing that's done so it's detected.

329
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:21,810
And I couldn't help but think of the perfect analogy to that was back in the heart of the COVID pandemic.

330
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:26,160
We were doing so much testing in the U.S. and President Trump said the problem,

331
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:29,640
the reason we have so many cases is because we're doing so much testing.

332
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:32,950
We need to test less. And it would be everything would be fine.

333
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:37,230
I'm sorry. That was exactly where my mind went when you were describing that.

334
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:41,700
Okay. Thank you so much for sharing for digging into those articles.

335
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:51,910
Next up on our agenda is to reorganize into our debate teams and you'll have some time for discussion.

336
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:58,050
We've got about 30 minutes or so left in the class period, so I'll let you all get get reorganized.

337
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:04,130
I will go ahead and kind of just pop around to each group and just, uh, avail myself.

338
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:16,070
Do you guys have any specific questions about your own debate planning the rest of us here?
