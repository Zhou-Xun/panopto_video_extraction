1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,031
in this session, we're going to start talking about something that's

2
00:00:04,031 --> 00:00:07,546
really near and dear to my heart genetic association studies.

3
00:00:07,546 --> 00:00:12,572
In the first session, we'll talk about genetic studies of poly

4
00:00:12,572 --> 00:00:19,089
genic traits generally Learning objectives are to describe the purpose of genetic

5
00:00:19,089 --> 00:00:25,605
association studies to define the word phenotype, to define palla genic trait and

6
00:00:25,605 --> 00:00:30,100
to identify four different types of apologetic traits.

7
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:35,500
A genetic association study is simply an observational study that tests for

8
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:40,731
a statistically significant association, some kind of relationship or

9
00:00:40,731 --> 00:00:45,539
even just a correlation between one or more genetic markers which we

10
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:49,586
consider to be the exposure of interest and a phenotype or

11
00:00:49,586 --> 00:00:54,520
some kind of trade of interest, which we consider to be the outcome.

12
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:59,586
So we're simply just looking for an association between genetic

13
00:00:59,586 --> 00:01:04,374
variability and some trait related to human health disease or

14
00:01:04,374 --> 00:01:07,395
something else that is influenced by genetics.

15
00:01:08,161 --> 00:01:13,789
Trade variability in humans is influenced by the genome in multiple ways.

16
00:01:13,789 --> 00:01:19,621
First, you have the genomics which is really what we consider to be the D.

17
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:20,970
N. A sequence.

18
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:23,121
So we've learned a lot about the A.

19
00:01:23,121 --> 00:01:23,732
T. CS.

20
00:01:23,732 --> 00:01:28,671
And Gs, how they are the the letter code of the D.

21
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:30,737
N. A.

22
00:01:30,737 --> 00:01:35,154
The genome can influence human health disease and

23
00:01:35,154 --> 00:01:40,729
other varied variability directly by having changes in the DNA

24
00:01:40,729 --> 00:01:46,008
bases that affect protein structure or protein function.

25
00:01:46,008 --> 00:01:52,355
And that will be a direct influence on some trade of interest.

26
00:01:52,355 --> 00:01:57,557
The genome can also influence other aspects of what we

27
00:01:57,557 --> 00:02:04,320
consider a broader category of of comics or even genomics more broadly.

28
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,043
One thing is the effigy gnome which we're going to talk about in later

29
00:02:09,043 --> 00:02:11,171
lectures where you have the D.

30
00:02:11,171 --> 00:02:11,731
N.

31
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:17,981
A sequence itself doesn't change, but the set of molecular signals,

32
00:02:17,981 --> 00:02:24,455
talking about when to transcribe any genes in that region will change.

33
00:02:24,455 --> 00:02:25,581
And the genome itself, the D.

34
00:02:25,581 --> 00:02:26,381
N.

35
00:02:26,381 --> 00:02:30,028
A sequence also influences the ePA genome.

36
00:02:30,028 --> 00:02:34,645
The ePA genome itself can have an influence on human health, disease and

37
00:02:34,645 --> 00:02:36,017
other variability.

38
00:02:36,017 --> 00:02:39,691
And one way that it does that it's through changing the transcriptome.

39
00:02:39,691 --> 00:02:44,916
So the transcriptome is the messenger RNA that is transcribed and

40
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:49,007
the transcriptome can be influenced by genomics.

41
00:02:49,007 --> 00:02:52,077
It can be influenced by ePA genomics and other things.

42
00:02:52,077 --> 00:02:56,759
And so this is sort of a system where you've got these different layers that

43
00:02:56,759 --> 00:03:00,996
sort of work together to influence human health, human disease and

44
00:03:00,996 --> 00:03:02,875
other kinds of variability.

45
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:06,780
And when we think about that it can be very broad.

46
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:11,209
So it can be thinking about diseases that affect different organ systems like

47
00:03:11,209 --> 00:03:13,400
the brain, the heart and the kidneys.

48
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,640
It can be thinking about ways, for example, that humans process drugs.

49
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:22,459
It could be thinking about our responses to different kinds of viruses.

50
00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:26,258
Or it could be thinking about more complex processes,

51
00:03:26,258 --> 00:03:27,884
things like cognition, genetic association studies are what we think

52
00:03:31,214 --> 00:03:35,521
of when we when we directly think about the influence of the D.

53
00:03:35,521 --> 00:03:39,976
N. A sequence on human health disease and

54
00:03:39,976 --> 00:03:42,460
other variability.

55
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:46,912
So when we think about a genetic marker or some kind of genotype we're

56
00:03:46,912 --> 00:03:51,540
thinking about any kind of genetic polymorphism that's measurable.

57
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:56,387
So the requirements for being a genetic marker are that it varies

58
00:03:56,387 --> 00:03:59,810
across individuals groups or populations.

59
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:05,453
These changes can occur in coding or non coding regions of the genome.

60
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:11,033
And some examples are things like snips and also copy number variants.

61
00:04:11,033 --> 00:04:17,861
Haplotype, VN TRS, anything that is related to the D.

62
00:04:17,861 --> 00:04:18,387
N. A.

63
00:04:18,387 --> 00:04:22,820
Sequence and varies across people.

64
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:27,511
The phenotype is what geneticists call any kind of measurable

65
00:04:27,511 --> 00:04:30,136
trait that we might be looking at.

66
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:34,361
So you've got your genotype and you've got your phenotype and

67
00:04:34,361 --> 00:04:38,997
the phenotype is like I said, any trait it could be quantitative.

68
00:04:38,997 --> 00:04:41,457
So things like height, blood pressure or

69
00:04:41,457 --> 00:04:44,140
glucose levels are measured on a continuum.

70
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:49,257
And we call those quantitative phenotype or they can be qualitative where

71
00:04:49,257 --> 00:04:54,053
you either have it or you don't or it could be different categories.

72
00:04:54,053 --> 00:04:59,036
So for example, qualitative phenotype could be things like heart disease,

73
00:04:59,036 --> 00:04:59,776
cancer or hair color.

74
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,900
Just to give you some historical context.

75
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:08,033
You know, this sort of came about early in the mid 18 hundreds with Gregor Mendel and

76
00:05:08,033 --> 00:05:10,173
we've talked about this before and

77
00:05:10,173 --> 00:05:15,022
Mendel's experiments can really be thought of as the first genetic association

78
00:05:15,022 --> 00:05:19,823
studies where you weren't able to measure the genes at the time or look at the D.

79
00:05:19,823 --> 00:05:21,316
N. A sequence.

80
00:05:21,316 --> 00:05:26,888
But you could see that there was a single heritable factor that was correlated

81
00:05:26,888 --> 00:05:32,118
with observable outcomes and mental focused on discrete qualitative

82
00:05:32,118 --> 00:05:36,850
traits like having purple flowers or white flowers for example.

83
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:41,493
And we already know that disorders that are the result of single gene mutations

84
00:05:41,493 --> 00:05:46,154
are called dandelion disorders because they follow these very simple pattern.

85
00:05:46,154 --> 00:05:46,373
Well later in the mid 19 hundreds, you have a group of people who

86
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:56,207
are considered to be the fathers of quantitative and population genetics.

87
00:05:56,207 --> 00:06:00,726
This includes Fischer, wright and haldane.

88
00:06:00,726 --> 00:06:05,700
What these people did were they recognized that if you have a single gene that

89
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:09,752
controls a trait, it can produce only limited variability.

90
00:06:09,752 --> 00:06:13,738
And that actually if you want the variability that's seen in more

91
00:06:13,738 --> 00:06:17,869
complex traits like those in human populations, you actually have

92
00:06:17,869 --> 00:06:22,651
to have the influence of many genes acting together to produce that complex and

93
00:06:22,651 --> 00:06:24,842
continuously distributed trait.

94
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:30,825
So if you look over here, here's where you just have one gene, it looks like,

95
00:06:30,825 --> 00:06:36,140
you know, you need a sort of a microscope to see the slide and I apologize.

96
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:41,270
But here you have the gina types are a one and a two.

97
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,290
You can have an A.

98
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,266
One allele or an A to a little and

99
00:06:44,266 --> 00:06:49,360
here a two would be the number of pills that increase the phenotype of interest.

100
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:55,044
And so if you just have to alleles with equal frequency at one genetic site,

101
00:06:55,044 --> 00:07:01,254
Then your distribution of your trade of interest are 25% of the people have a one,

102
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:05,205
a one or zero copies of the trade increasing a little.

103
00:07:05,205 --> 00:07:10,405
50% of people are hetero cigarettes and they have this middle phenotype.

104
00:07:10,405 --> 00:07:15,185
And then 25% are homos I guess and have the two copies of the trade

105
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:20,310
increasingly ill and have the most extreme phenotype in that direction.

106
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:20,365
So if we actually add another locus, the B locus,

107
00:07:23,724 --> 00:07:29,437
now you've got four different types that can result from the combination of the A.

108
00:07:29,437 --> 00:07:30,171
Locus and the B.

109
00:07:30,171 --> 00:07:34,437
Locus, each with two levels each equally frequent.

110
00:07:34,437 --> 00:07:36,881
And if you add a third locus, the C.

111
00:07:36,881 --> 00:07:37,580
Locus.

112
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:42,524
Now you've got six different phenotype that could result from a combination

113
00:07:42,524 --> 00:07:47,467
of those three, those three low side each with equally frequent alleles that

114
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,450
have an effect on your phenotype of interest.

115
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:55,325
And if we just keep increasing the number of low side that are involved

116
00:07:55,325 --> 00:07:59,880
then the trait becomes relatively continuously distributed.

117
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,261
So some examples might be height or blood pressure.

118
00:08:03,535 --> 00:08:09,087
So let's think about polly genic and environmentally influenced traits.

119
00:08:09,087 --> 00:08:13,900
So you've got genes that move people sort of along the continuum.

120
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:18,833
So you've got these alleles and let's say you've got you know multiple los I they

121
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:22,267
each have an allele that decreases trait variability and

122
00:08:22,267 --> 00:08:24,720
one that increases trade variability.

123
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,031
Right?

124
00:08:26,031 --> 00:08:31,877
So as you get more and more lo sai that are contributing to the trade of interest,

125
00:08:31,877 --> 00:08:34,506
you have more information that moves

126
00:08:34,506 --> 00:08:39,028
people either increasing along the continuum or decreasing.

127
00:08:39,028 --> 00:08:40,666
So genes are doing that.

128
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:42,046
The environment can also move people along a continuum.

129
00:08:42,046 --> 00:08:48,580
So here we've got an example of people arranged by height and

130
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:53,157
this is you know, a real group of people.

131
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:57,956
And you can see sort of the poly genic action here where these are the shortest

132
00:08:57,956 --> 00:09:01,312
people on the left and the tallest people on the right.

133
00:09:01,312 --> 00:09:05,805
And there's a lot of people in the middle that have sort of medium height.

134
00:09:05,805 --> 00:09:06,400
And so let's think about this population, you've got a population

135
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:06,935
where you have low side that increase or decrease height.

136
00:09:06,935 --> 00:09:14,406
Let's say here that the pink line is the distribution

137
00:09:14,406 --> 00:09:19,719
of height of people in this population

138
00:09:19,719 --> 00:09:24,880
when they have adequate nutrition.

139
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:30,299
Now let's put these same people with their same genetics in an environment

140
00:09:30,299 --> 00:09:35,975
where they don't have adequate nutrition, there's a famine, let's say so

141
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:40,896
the environment can actually create a shift in that distribution.

142
00:09:40,896 --> 00:09:43,704
So you still have people who are really tall and

143
00:09:43,704 --> 00:09:48,040
most people are sort of medium height and some people are really short.

144
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,382
But because you didn't have adequate nutrition,

145
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:54,502
the mean of that populations height can shift.

146
00:09:54,502 --> 00:10:00,433
Okay, so here in the example, this red line is the same genetic people,

147
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:05,687
but in a low food environment And in this case the environment has

148
00:10:05,687 --> 00:10:11,840
caused a mean shift of 3" downward due to this environmental influence.

149
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:16,266
And so when we're thinking about genetics and we're thinking about

150
00:10:16,266 --> 00:10:21,298
apologetic traits, we also have to keep in mind that it's not just genetics,

151
00:10:21,298 --> 00:10:25,820
but also the environment that can move people down and up a continuum.

152
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:25,950
And when we're thinking about traits and are they poly genic?

153
00:10:30,065 --> 00:10:33,095
Some traits are very highly apologetic.

154
00:10:33,095 --> 00:10:35,201
So this is an example.

155
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:38,645
It was done 10 years ago now where they looked at

156
00:10:38,645 --> 00:10:43,517
the they did a genetic association study looking at snips associated

157
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:46,800
with height in about 200,000 people.

158
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,758
And this is a picture of the chromosomes and all of the locations where

159
00:10:51,758 --> 00:10:56,305
they actually found a locust that was associated with height.

160
00:10:56,305 --> 00:11:00,708
And you can see that almost every chromosome has some low side

161
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:04,960
that influence height, height is incredibly palla genic.

162
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:09,297
It's influenced by a lot of different things ranging from you know,

163
00:11:09,297 --> 00:11:13,185
genes that control the growth of bones, to genes that control

164
00:11:13,185 --> 00:11:17,330
how you absorb nutrients from food and a variety of other things.

165
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:22,326
And so some traits are extremely apologetic.

166
00:11:22,326 --> 00:11:26,790
One thing that we want to also do is is really think about the way that we're

167
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,166
defining phenotype.

168
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:30,846
Sor defining traits for our genetic association studies.

169
00:11:30,846 --> 00:11:36,023
So remember we're looking for genetic factors that

170
00:11:36,023 --> 00:11:42,785
move people sort of along a continuum or in some cases over a threshold.

171
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:47,556
So when we think about polly genic or multifactorial trades,

172
00:11:47,556 --> 00:11:52,328
we can think about continuous and discontinuous phenotype,

173
00:11:52,328 --> 00:11:56,182
continuous phenotype include things that we call

174
00:11:56,182 --> 00:12:01,155
traits which are you know more more continuous and diseases.

175
00:12:01,155 --> 00:12:05,218
So traits that are continuous include things like height, intelligence,

176
00:12:05,218 --> 00:12:08,080
blood pressure, skin color metabolic parameters.

177
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:14,220
These are sort of those that that are sort of a spectrum like we talked about before.

178
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:18,590
And we can take these continuous traits and

179
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:27,104
we can draw thresholds where people we can say either have the disease or they don't.

180
00:12:27,104 --> 00:12:30,969
So for example, here's a plot of systolic blood pressure and

181
00:12:30,969 --> 00:12:36,632
this is the distribution of systolic blood pressure among some sample of people.

182
00:12:36,632 --> 00:12:38,192
The U.

183
00:12:38,192 --> 00:12:40,270
S. Population let's say.

184
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:46,483
And so most people have blood pressure around 100 and 10 millimeters mercury,

185
00:12:46,483 --> 00:12:52,625
140 millimeters of mercury is where we define someone is having hypertension.

186
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:57,025
So we can draw a line here and say everybody on this side is not

187
00:12:57,025 --> 00:13:01,340
hypertensive and everyone on this side is hypertensive.

188
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:03,365
And that definition can change,

189
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:08,510
it used to be that we define hypertension as 100 and 60 millimeters of mercury.

190
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:12,953
So now when we change the definition all of a sudden these people who didn't have

191
00:13:12,953 --> 00:13:14,494
disease now have disease.

192
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:20,898
People between 100 and 40 and 100 and 60 millimeters Mercury of blood pressure.

193
00:13:20,898 --> 00:13:25,327
And so the point is that we can look at these continuous traits and

194
00:13:25,327 --> 00:13:29,592
that gives us a lot of information in the area where most people

195
00:13:29,592 --> 00:13:34,102
are sitting which is not having the disease or we can draw a line and

196
00:13:34,102 --> 00:13:38,796
say people on this side have disease and people on that side don't.

197
00:13:38,796 --> 00:13:41,092
Those are continuous traits.

198
00:13:41,092 --> 00:13:43,071
There are discontinuous traits as well.

199
00:13:43,071 --> 00:13:46,661
So one is congenital malformation.

200
00:13:46,661 --> 00:13:48,857
So cleft lips and cleft palate.

201
00:13:48,857 --> 00:13:53,134
And in thoughtfully pile oryx diagnosis congenital heart disease,

202
00:13:53,134 --> 00:13:57,790
these are disorders at birth that you're either born with or you're not.

203
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:02,368
And then there are other kinds of diseases that we think of as discontinuous

204
00:14:02,368 --> 00:14:07,545
including manic depressive disorder, schizophrenia and rheumatoid arthritis.

205
00:14:07,545 --> 00:14:14,658
And so what's kind of interesting about these discontinuous traits is

206
00:14:14,658 --> 00:14:21,116
these diseases is that a lot of times these are really subjective.

207
00:14:21,116 --> 00:14:27,044
So manic depressive or bipolar disorder is something that you can have

208
00:14:27,044 --> 00:14:33,786
a variety of different characteristics that combine to meet that definition.

209
00:14:33,786 --> 00:14:38,513
And so it's actually in some ways potentially a lot of different genetic

210
00:14:38,513 --> 00:14:42,863
influences that are operating differently in different people.

211
00:14:42,863 --> 00:14:48,388
The congenital malformations are kind of interesting because what what happens

212
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:53,667
with congenital malformations is that you've got a set of alleles that if you

213
00:14:53,667 --> 00:14:59,208
get enough of them, you'll get the disease and we call this genetic liability.

214
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:01,823
So if you have a low genetic liability,

215
00:15:01,823 --> 00:15:06,501
it means you have very few of the alleles that will cause the disease and

216
00:15:06,501 --> 00:15:11,575
you will be, you won't get the disease at birth, you'll be unaffected and

217
00:15:11,575 --> 00:15:16,253
most people have sort of this mid range of genetic liability where they

218
00:15:16,253 --> 00:15:20,970
carry some alleles that might cause the trait or and some that don't.

219
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:25,867
But what happens is if you carry enough of the alleles that would tend to

220
00:15:25,867 --> 00:15:29,686
cause something like cleft lip or palate for example,

221
00:15:29,686 --> 00:15:34,834
you can go over this threshold and so your genetic liability is high enough

222
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:40,089
that you jump over the number of a legal threshold and you become affected.

223
00:15:40,089 --> 00:15:45,447
And that's a form of discontinuous phenotype as well.

224
00:15:45,447 --> 00:15:50,283
And so when we think about genetic studies, you know what people kind of

225
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:55,208
tend to say is like, hey it must be genetic because it runs in the family.

226
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:58,784
So if we have traits that run in the family,

227
00:15:58,784 --> 00:16:02,940
how much variation in a trait is really due to genes.

228
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:06,971
We have studies that can quantify that the genetic contribution to traits and

229
00:16:06,971 --> 00:16:07,761
those are.

230
00:16:07,761 --> 00:16:11,188
Historically twin studies have been used a lot and

231
00:16:11,188 --> 00:16:16,261
other studies of heritability that are most of the time done in families.

232
00:16:16,261 --> 00:16:20,216
So we can look at how much variation in the trade is due to genes.

233
00:16:20,216 --> 00:16:23,129
If we want to know which genes are involved,

234
00:16:23,129 --> 00:16:28,510
we need study designs that identify genomic regions associated with the trait.

235
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:32,657
So we've already talked about linkage analysis as being one and

236
00:16:32,657 --> 00:16:37,418
genetic association studies are really the other that we are going to talk

237
00:16:37,418 --> 00:16:42,335
more about and will help identify that specific genetic factors identified

238
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:44,060
with the trade of interest
