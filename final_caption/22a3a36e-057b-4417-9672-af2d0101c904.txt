1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:09,470
Know, I hope and I hope it's interesting for you folks and it kind of covers some of the it relates to the topics and stuff.

2
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,890
So here we go. I figure why not start with an anecdote?

3
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:21,479
It's cold out today. Yes, yes, yes. If you are yesterday, nice and warm.

4
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,290
Yesterday was a windy where you were. Yeah, yeah.

5
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:30,690
Super windy where I am. And I had a conversation and I for the first time with my son.

6
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:37,290
So I live on Chelsea. I love Chelsea. It's a nice little town. I live on the woods and we like to go out in the woods because it's nice.

7
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:40,589
There's stuff out there. You can do things. He likes to make a stick and he kind of website.

8
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,130
I think it's sometimes it's a a sword, sometimes it's a staff, sometimes whatever.

9
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,990
But he wants to go out there when it's super, super windy.

10
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:54,060
I do not like when he wants to go out there when it's super, super windy.

11
00:00:54,360 --> 00:01:03,300
Why do you think it's going to be trees might fall because stuff like this might happen in those words when it is super, super windy.

12
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,720
Climate change means trees don't necessarily go quite as well.

13
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:11,940
Super, super big winds. And yet things can fall down from the sky and hit his head.

14
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,350
And case in point, what happened yesterday when he wanted to go outside?

15
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:19,530
A gigantic tree limb falls down in our front yard.

16
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:23,400
He wasn't out there but one in the hall. He could have been.

17
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:27,330
And the kid will not listen to me when I say, you know what?

18
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:32,040
Maybe we can just plant say to his point, to this point, he's the one out there.

19
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,790
I do other things that I could get hurt. For example, when he rides his bike on the road.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,410
Well, that's our only that's a fair point.

21
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:44,730
But I can I you know what? That's a question we might be able to answer.

22
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:52,590
And so it led into a little bit of introducing this a little bit earlier than than I thought I was going to.

23
00:01:52,980 --> 00:02:04,469
So the interesting thing about the way that we can utilize data in some cases is we can start to make a question like, let's see here, Dad,

24
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:11,220
is it really that concerning for me to go walking out in the woods or is that any more dangerous than, for example, when I go ride my bike?

25
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:17,760
And we can think about that. So how do we start to assess injuries, particularly those that we're not familiar with?

26
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,920
Well, as it turns out, we can think about how much a tree weighs.

27
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:30,570
Never would have thought about this, but I did a little bit digging. And sure enough, you can figure out that if you know how big the tree is,

28
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:36,720
kind of about how your chest is, you can kind of estimate about how tall it is.

29
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:43,440
You can get a sense of how much a tree weighs. So in this case, we're thinking about like a red or white oak.

30
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,450
Chelsea So Red Oak has the low as like pointy leaves or white oak has kind of a bulbous leaves.

31
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:59,370
I did a law firm estimate about 18 inches and the nerve to step it off about 18 next steps to me got about 42 feet tall.

32
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:05,640
Well, I plug that in and the thing that's the size of that land, it keeps falling down into our yard.

33
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,929
Could be about 20 £200. Mm hmm. Yeah.

34
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:17,460
And weighs 101 tons. What do you think wins the 2200 versus 101 does that thing comes crashing down?

35
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:22,320
I, I don't think it's get I really don't think it's going to be down a more realistically.

36
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,530
This is a big, big tree. We have some big all trees out there.

37
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:31,260
If this thing moves out to like kind of your standard kind of big size oak tree, that's about three feet in diameter.

38
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:42,180
You put it about 70 feet tall. You could have 15, £20,000 of weight hanging up there in the sky, ready to come crashing down to you on a windy day.

39
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:46,020
So this is a very dangerous possibility.

40
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:51,240
How dangerous? Well, the CDC actually collects some of this data.

41
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:57,150
There is a great system for trying to understand how injuries are happening in this country.

42
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:57,749
Right.

43
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:06,780
And they categorize the way that people the way the fatalities happen in this country across a very, very broad spectrum of different types of injury.

44
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:12,900
I think it's really, really interesting because it helps us make cases, for example,

45
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:21,510
if we believe there is a problem that's going unnoticed or if the the severity of the problem is is increasing or changing over time,

46
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:25,230
the wonder database at CDC is open to the public.

47
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:27,420
We can use it together. All sorts of questions.

48
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:36,060
In this case, I'm going to answer a question about, well, how often do people really do get hit by something and die?

49
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:44,850
This is the kind of problem that's posed to me. Is this really something that I need to be worried about so I can go to the CDC database page?

50
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:49,590
You can see there are a couple of different ways that you can get to where a data search.

51
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:56,100
But we're going to look through the categories of causes of injury, death.

52
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:59,910
Okay. And they have hundreds of different codes and they're not just in.

53
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,720
They could also include things like neoplasms, so cancer and other ways that people die.

54
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:09,030
But I am going to be interested in some of the ones that are specific to injury.

55
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:16,380
So I'm going to go look through and it turns out that I'll come back to this in just a second.

56
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:21,720
They have a category struck by a thrown, projected or falling object.

57
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:28,950
Now, maybe not every single one of these is a falling object like a tree limb,

58
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:33,150
but at least starts to give us a sense of how often is this happening to people?

59
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:40,000
We can break it down by all sorts of demographic information your age, your race, your sex, your your geolocation, right?

60
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:46,530
All of that is is customizable so that you can figure out that at least in the United States in 2020,

61
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:54,390
about 23 people in Gavin's age range were killed by something that was thrown, projected or foreign object.

62
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,910
And then we can even break it down by intention.

63
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:06,059
So those that were caused by somebody else versus in this case, this is just an unintentional somehow, someway or something was thrown at their own,

64
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:13,470
projected or fell down and hurt someone badly enough that that they they were they were killed for you.

65
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:19,080
Now, I want you to help me answer the question or Gavin's rejoinder.

66
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:25,710
Can you work with this CDC database and tell me, is the relative risk of getting struck,

67
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,520
thrown by or struck by a thrown and projected or falling object?

68
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:36,030
Is that more likely than if you were riding on a bicycle and you were hit by a motor vehicle?

69
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:43,079
So I'm thinking cars, trucks, busses, the ability to discriminate is actually quite fine.

70
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:50,219
So the granularity can include things like ATV, it can include how you were engaging in the bike.

71
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,200
You could be another bike, it can be a pedestrian.

72
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:57,900
It's a lot of granularity what I want folks to do, and I'm hoping if you don't have a laptop you can work with partner.

73
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:01,260
I want you to work with partners anyways, but check out the wonder database.

74
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:06,660
I'd love it if you could figure out age differences and cycling deaths.

75
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:16,100
Okay. So I used the 2020 as my baseline year for the falling objects, but you can take data all the way back to 1999.

76
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:20,130
I'm hoping that you can find from these categories,

77
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:25,980
I'm going to direct you to V0 12y 89 because that's going to be most of the injury related categories.

78
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:32,220
Everything that happened before, that is going to be a lot of illness and and things that are happening to us outside of injury spaces.

79
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,529
You can take a look at all the different categories,

80
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:40,079
but you're going to find those that might be related to cycling and getting struck by motor vehicle, because that's Gavin's question.

81
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:48,000
He wants to know, isn't it more likely that I could get hit by a car riding my bike than me walking out in the woods when it's windy?

82
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:55,020
So find a partner. Take a look at some of this data if you want to.

83
00:07:55,020 --> 00:08:00,090
It takes a minute and you'll find that what you run one query, it's it takes 3 seconds.

84
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,559
If you want to play around with it.

85
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:07,650
Look at some other some other ways to either break out this data doesn't have to be by age, can be by race in the by region.

86
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:14,400
Lots of different ways that we can consider it, but poke around with it, explore it, think about some of the things that are most interesting to you.

87
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,780
And so at the end, I'd love to answer some of these questions, too.

88
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:21,269
Now that you know that this exists and now that you know how easy it's going to be to

89
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:26,040
look at 20 years of injury data and all the ways that people are going to be done,

90
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:32,880
what are we going to do with this information? Can we do anything? Is this just a curiosity and a fun anecdote that we're doing in class today?

91
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:36,360
Or can you figure out a way to use it in your final project from the work that you're going to do?

92
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:41,880
So question before I turn you loose, you think you can do it?

93
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,380
I bet you can do this. It's actually pretty user friendly.

94
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:50,970
I just gave you the quick rundown, but there are all sorts of customization that you can do.

95
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,589
I think you're going to find it pretty interesting.

96
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:57,300
And when you look at the different categories, a lot of different ways that they're categorizing injury here.

97
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,500
So based on your interest, if you want to toy around it, we'll get some of the different outcomes.

98
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:09,600
Please feel free. We'll spend maybe 25 minutes and then let's come back as a class, if you can answer my question that I can come back together,

99
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,850
see me, and if there's anything else that kind of top down is your exploration.

100
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:18,640
Let's hear about that, too. It's not okay. Yeah.

101
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:24,149
All right, that's fine. How long were you on that island?

102
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:35,680
And I was like, There's nobody here. Globalization.

103
00:09:36,630 --> 00:10:08,150
Yeah, I mean. So that the underlining part of the company and I just can't reconcile that because people

104
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:17,040
that are opposed to this is different from mortar and vehicle identifier specifically.

105
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:23,090
So I want to know yes, cycling on mean, you could take a look at motor vehicles that you'd rather say motor vehicle accidents.

106
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:26,150
Are there going to be a different level than people riding bicycles?

107
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:28,700
But then you can also think about the intersection of the two.

108
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:36,680
So it's it's going to be refined enough that you can look at the people who are on bikes struck by motor vehicles or who are hit by other things.

109
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:44,929
You'd be surprised at the level of discrimination with this. Would it be categorized as other so you can look through it?

110
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:48,440
I found a couple of categories that I kind of counting so you can select more than one.

111
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:55,700
So there are 100 hierarchical orders, so you can take one that has all of the different sort of cycling injuries that you have.

112
00:10:56,030 --> 00:11:01,840
And I feel like that's not quite this question. It could be because I just sorted through every meal.

113
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:05,870
Yeah. You can decide specifically about going on the road and hit by a car.

114
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:09,400
I'm sorry, this is more. But that's kind of what he's talking about. So can we.

115
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:17,030
We can be a little more refined in our search to figure out the category, specifically cycles that was struck by a car or other motor vehicle.

116
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:25,800
And again, if you have a different question that's equally exciting and interesting and engaging, you go for it.

117
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:32,650
This is just for by clicking on this link, you've already learned what I want you to learn today, I.

118
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:38,659
Yes, you can. No, you did not with that.

119
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:48,100
I know that line.

120
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:52,279
Yeah, I'm doing that. But yeah, you're right.

121
00:11:52,280 --> 00:12:01,969
It is. You know, there's so many subcategories now, and you kind of like.

122
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:11,860
I'm looking of all the. Here is a Twitter user learning process and should be generic.

123
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:23,470
And that was when I first started in terms of support and judgment.

124
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:33,820
And I don't think they're trying to tell you that right away.

125
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:39,610
This is premature in the statement. You know, no.

126
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:49,300
I think there are certain individuals who are going to be a lot harder to live with from both parties.

127
00:12:50,580 --> 00:13:08,680
So the difference is this war of words that you can use or you know how to turn that around, you know, all together.

128
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:15,030
Yemen is 12 years old, different age. I was going to confirm tonight.

129
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:20,220
Yeah. So, yeah, you can break it down. You know, I find that out.

130
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:25,500
And you know what used to be always decades. Now they can do like five year intervals or even one year.

131
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:32,020
So if you really want to know what's going on Europe and if you are right,

132
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:35,379
I mean me thinking about that, we should try to think critically about this.

133
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:39,090
Is it fair to talk about 2020 by itself or should we really say, you know, Jake,

134
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,650
let's think about five year averages because that's probably a better representation of what's

135
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:50,440
happening across some of these different categories or or some of these things are pretty rare events.

136
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,560
Right. If you want to,

137
00:13:51,790 --> 00:14:00,400
you might see that some of the incident rates that are populated in that table outcome table are too small to calculate or they're not reliable.

138
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:06,190
And that's usually because it's something that's pretty darn rare, especially as we start to get into smaller group environments.

139
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:12,700
So things to consider as you're started and really thinking about your practice and some of the spaces where you might want to utilize this data.

140
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:28,220
Other. Well, yeah.

141
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:40,190
And I just want to point out.

142
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:48,900
For another. No, I don't.

143
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:59,010
Yeah, I think I heard you.

144
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:16,790
So you can do whatever you want to do injury prevention and control, and I guess we can just play around our goal in front of it.

145
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:25,430
So how do you guess there's up to. Yeah, there's definitely a turn out, you know.

146
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:30,200
I think yeah, I think like I think for the team.

147
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:46,850
But I'm not going to give scenarios. That's the kind of day that was the first thing.

148
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:14,880
When I was. I think external causes.

149
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:31,310
Who the urbanization date is may be interesting to. And transport them.

150
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:42,070
So I chose all.

151
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:10,490
Yeah. I think that's why I was really.

152
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:27,850
I don't think I need an assessment.

153
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:45,110
Hutchinson was says as.

154
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:52,190
I have. You just asked me to.

155
00:17:54,260 --> 00:18:02,059
What is that? All they have is they have their own kind of way of breaking into the country.

156
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:05,900
So that kind of stuff. The East Coast is one of them.

157
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:17,720
When you click on it, I think they'll give you a definition for their different regions. So for accidental value, not too bad for watching.

158
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:22,430
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah.

159
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:26,950
That's hilarious. Right.

160
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:32,290
Yeah. But it was like, so, so great.

161
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:37,159
400,000 is unreliable. So when you have been thinking about that, what what could you do?

162
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:41,479
You could either one take out a larger span of years and see if that's going to help?

163
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:46,130
You could think about trying to find equivalent counties. Perhaps maybe it's all counties in southeast Michigan.

164
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:54,270
I've got county guys in Michigan. And, you know, but there's does Allegheny County look like, you know,

165
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:57,799
wash out that you really do have to worry about the kinds of energy and how

166
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:03,650
they're going to compare contrast from ours and a county is north looks very,

167
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:07,280
very different. So there's nothing wrong with taking a look at it.

168
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:14,480
But still, yeah, I wish you could see helmet use because you have such and such a thing.

169
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:19,129
That's a potential answer to this question.

170
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:26,180
So keep that in mind. How does that prevent us from where are some of the strengths?

171
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:36,860
What are some limitations? And I know that doesn't seem like maybe I don't understand.

172
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:45,080
I feel like suicide's higher in. What are you using?

173
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:52,390
What are your. Oh, yeah.

174
00:19:53,290 --> 00:20:00,730
Yeah. So that maybe does resonate if you think about it, or find the 14 year olds,

175
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:09,459
they're going to get more energized and the result of the violence might not seem quite obvious, maybe even bring it into the five years old.

176
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:13,540
So you have an enhancement in more than nine words that are just starting to baby.

177
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:28,490
I understand that pretty well for a long time, but actually I also think it's got 5 to 10 points in the ten years.

178
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:32,230
Oh, no, it's, it's, it's very yeah.

179
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:38,240
I would maybe I think I would I might try that ten year. I think that's probably more impactful than too narrow.

180
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:46,000
Yeah. You get this is like your first week spending time with people of different ages and that kind of like affected.

181
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:53,880
Oh, yes. That could be one of the limitations. Yes, I think they're keeping all the cards right.

182
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:59,720
So it's never too much that I guess we don't, you know, just don't catch people.

183
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:12,810
But those people can just be very. I get the gist of.

184
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:33,300
I just don't know. Is this just putting psychosis? You know, like it is.

185
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:39,530
And I mean, he was like, yeah. So I didn't hear him say, like on the advice of that.

186
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:43,020
And I was like, You should wear your helmet.

187
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:46,490
Your other things are your bike. Like yourself, you.

188
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:54,760
Yeah. How do you how do you be more specific? They say you look at the moment from England.

189
00:21:55,370 --> 00:22:03,200
I don't know. I think that you could see a media circus if they had a as part of their categorization.

190
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:07,280
They can take it down sewers and search.

191
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:17,329
So as part of these codes, if you want to search for a specific code, you can click search here and then we'll see.

192
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:25,860
Say, I don't know if they have helmet. It doesn't look like that anything related to Helmet.

193
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:34,370
But this is how, incidentally, I found the falling tree thing. You love your brain, okay?

194
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:41,640
And I guess it has its limitations. Yes, it out.

195
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:51,299
So again, this is open to anybody who wants to use it. I'm going to give you an example of how we have used it and then use it in our books thing.

196
00:22:51,300 --> 00:23:02,040
But if this is my first time to play around with some of these horribly different operations of war is an option as actions of war, operations of war.

197
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:09,570
And there's I'm not surprised right on this is that like just like military not like only that like

198
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:17,790
so they define their codes and then you can take a peek at how you put some kind of group together.

199
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:29,280
This is, like I said, I mean, that could be a training helicopter going down to a national conference.

200
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:33,250
A different set of different.

201
00:23:38,530 --> 00:24:03,820
I made. We proceed on the maps and there's nothing.

202
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:32,230
He. Very.

203
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:45,840
Let's go about five more minutes. If you already have an answer to my question, maybe think about another one that you can answer with this over here.

204
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:51,650
Sometimes you give us a sense of mortality and we're going to have.

205
00:24:53,440 --> 00:25:00,790
A man with a child who is not as good, though.

206
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:06,820
Mr. But I know. I know you're lying. It's like how you believe you're going to get numbers.

207
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:14,130
Well, although I wasn't right. I don't know, because I really think that.

208
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:23,470
Because I think that there's a lot of, like, there friends and, like, my favorite thing so far is like some sort of accounting of different things.

209
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:30,170
And I can, like, go as far as accidents and the like, but I can also go my age group.

210
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:36,190
I know the answers about myself. I feel like I'm pretty concerned.

211
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:45,920
But, you know, what are you doing? Four six, seven, three nine, six, seven.

212
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:50,590
Was that. Oh, that's all. All right, I'll take that.

213
00:25:51,190 --> 00:26:01,010
Oh, that's nice. I like the Parkland shooter, just about life in prison in Israel.

214
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:04,820
I like the woman already out there like I had a baby.

215
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:09,700
And so, like, I remember her name.

216
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:17,900
If you look, say there's a big wrong case study of that shooter.

217
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:30,830
Oh, really? I don't know if it's if it's published at this point, but it kind of goes through a lot of first hand accounts of the precursors.

218
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:38,660
So I think it's it's highlighting the the triggers of the events,

219
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:46,580
the multiple missed signs or signals that was triggered by her having taken away a friend.

220
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:52,700
That's a great break up, which is always difficult because you're not trying to excuse a behavior yet,

221
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:55,370
but you're also trying to think about putting that behavior in context.

222
00:26:55,940 --> 00:27:02,020
And of course, at the time they go to the police response and were just it's one of these like comedy variations,

223
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:08,630
the results are disastrous all the way down this right opportunity.

224
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:13,430
Yeah. That's, what, five years next Valentine's Day?

225
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:22,880
You know, my floor in that case. So, yeah, I'll see if I can find that same human error and see if I can find the flaw.

226
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:30,980
I mean, my brother. But yeah, I was surprised that because of their level of information they were able to collect.

227
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:33,170
I don't think they ever spoke to the shooter and to that person.

228
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:43,430
I think they had some more than either one degree of separation or the the public record search and was.

229
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,230
Yeah, it was. Yeah.

230
00:27:49,350 --> 00:28:01,070
I want to find definition of they're positive that it's in their codes cause I clicked on it to work out and I think that not they.

231
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:11,470
Yeah. Because they've got to cause this is bringing a lot of.

232
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:23,030
Yeah. No. Yeah. Yeah.

233
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:29,250
So you think they should have a revision to the.

234
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:33,470
Yeah, but it's just because, like I said. Right.

235
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:41,130
And I guess I just want to know what it's like. Right. Right. Including, like when people are at work, but bringing in book.

236
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:51,370
Right. Um, yeah, I talked to one of these on one of these, like one of these like hands.

237
00:28:52,030 --> 00:29:00,290
You know, it's been a very active search, I think, you know, as far as CC, they might have a certain thing.

238
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:09,769
Great, sir. I was while I saw you.

239
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:15,590
And I was. I mean, I think I was looking for a new settlement.

240
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:22,120
Okay, so this part of it is like I.

241
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:28,639
Yeah, like even though, like, you don't know what he's doing.

242
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:33,560
The first clue that finally got kind of curious.

243
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:39,530
Many folks had seen either the wonders of the wonder database before or I'd played around with it.

244
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:44,030
Oh, good. Well, I'm glad you got to know it's out there.

245
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:52,310
I mean, I think data, our case is, is so valuable to, again, help us guide some of our decision making or make a case for what we want to do.

246
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:55,580
When you're writing up your policy brief at the end of the semester,

247
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:00,470
maybe consider how you can utilize this data to say, look at who this is affecting.

248
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:07,940
Look at how it's affecting at different rates for different groups and the ability to kind of break down all of this information by region,

249
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:15,169
by demographics, by whatever can be helpful. But to our question here, so Gavin says that, you know, like going from like.

250
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:21,680
Right. Could be just as dangerous as new walk in the woods during a windstorm. What you find so this was this was my data.

251
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:34,290
What did you find and how did you do it? So we will break it down by state.

252
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:44,580
Okay. So we were looking at Michigan specifically, and it didn't really seem that prevalent of an issue when comparing it to a motor vehicle accident.

253
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:53,400
And so I'm. They also broke it down by people that were intoxicated.

254
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:58,470
Okay. So it wasn't like only 30 people were killed in that way.

255
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:04,050
So problems were very low, 30 to 50 million population.

256
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:07,530
So okay. So tell me again how you broke down.

257
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:14,010
So this is a is someone cycling or is it somebody driving or what's a motor vehicle?

258
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:17,820
Okay. So is there somebody who died in a motor vehicle accident while intoxicated?

259
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:22,920
And you say this is in the state of Michigan.

260
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:33,300
And there was the results are there was 30 people, so a little over 15 million population in the car in 2020.

261
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:36,480
Over the course of three years, there was 24.

262
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:44,040
Okay. All right. So you had 30 intoxicated drivers that might have died in the state of Michigan in 2020,

263
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:48,690
in at least one or more of those kind of motor vehicle crash, there were.

264
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:53,730
Did you use a single heading or to use multiple indicates just like one.

265
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:59,960
Okay. All right. Know my son better not be intoxicated.

266
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:04,740
Always ready. Well, hopefully not.

267
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:10,140
We both were here. Yeah. So I found this result specifically for his age group.

268
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:19,200
4 to 14. I actually found a link leads from CBC to outside specifically.

269
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:28,020
I just. I don't know. This copy. I can show you that. Um, and the greatest point, 0.07.

270
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:32,730
Okay. And the cause of death is pedal cycles specifically for him.

271
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:39,929
Okay. So, look, there are just quite a few codes for pedal cycling, which the code that I use was.

272
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:45,690
Let me see what. ICD ten.

273
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:58,020
Here, this is the showing on my. It gives me the sequence.

274
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:05,850
Okay. So number three, in 20, 20, 33 fatalities with accrued rate of .07.

275
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:10,259
So that's less than that. More or less with this this one sort of showing, too.

276
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:15,220
But yeah, so this is what at a slightly higher rate, at least in terms of road number.

277
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:22,830
Um, but perhaps the rate per 100,000, maybe a little bit lower.

278
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:34,270
Farbstein Something similar or something different. Yeah.

279
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:44,690
Yeah. Um, I think she said you said like, over 133, I think.

280
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:50,780
Okay, so we get 25. Okay. Um, we chose Michigan.

281
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:56,880
And the age range 5 to 14 years. They also did male and white.

282
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,080
Okay.

283
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:14,660
And then we chose the ICD ten code that I'd like to think was the classic of an unspecified causal cyclist, something, something, a traffic accident.

284
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:19,280
And that's that was 25. Okay, great.

285
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:24,080
Anybody else conceptual idea any differently or a different way?

286
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:40,480
Sounds pretty similar to what I did. I think I found two codes in here that were, to me, pretty relevant.

287
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:44,070
I had a program by age group I used in nine states.

288
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:53,790
You looked at just 2020, and the two that I used were a collision with heavy transport vehicle or bus and car pickup van or truck.

289
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:59,100
Is that the right way to do this? I don't know. It works for me because it's answering a question that I think I care about.

290
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:03,570
And when I think about the injury that might be sustained, this is kind of my thought process.

291
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:08,790
Same time, we could have gotten more granular in terms of the types of people who are injured this way.

292
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:15,300
The state where this is happening all over again. So those small decisions are going to have an influence in terms of how you talk about the numbers.

293
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:21,840
So I think being transparent about the way that we're kind of breaking down and presenting this information is important.

294
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:25,410
Just out of curiosity, do anybody go beyond this and start playing around with it?

295
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:30,690
Yeah, we did. And all of it was suppressed, really.

296
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:39,420
So you got to find in terms of like trying to go across multiple like small cells around like you trying to do Michigan for some of the more specific.

297
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:48,890
Yeah. Car collision or I think it was like all the press, you know, small number.

298
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:52,590
Yeah. To not yeah. People. Mm hmm.

299
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:57,900
Mm hmm. So they had, like, I guess, done with that.

300
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:01,470
What do you I guess what do you do at that point? Yeah.

301
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:06,690
I mean, I don't know. I mean, this is what's available to us.

302
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:10,980
And the granularity is a fabulous, fabulous thing.

303
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:17,370
Right. You can get to all kinds of demarcations in terms of who we're talking about and very specific events.

304
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:25,350
But the likelihood that without looking across multiple years or in a broader geographic region or whatever, they have a larger denominator.

305
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:28,700
Essentially, you're probably going to get some of those episodes, right?

306
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:34,620
So if you're interested in really rare events that happen in Michigan or we even have someone breaking in every county,

307
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:37,920
chances are we might not pick it up with this system.

308
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:43,410
And that that is, you know, in my opinion, kind of a limitation of what we can do with this data.

309
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:50,480
Sure. Yeah. We're also recommendations that were so frustrating because we were trying to look at it also.

310
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:57,629
This is where they know where the data. Yeah.

311
00:36:57,630 --> 00:37:03,420
I mean, that's that's an unfortunate one, especially for, for example, like overdoses.

312
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:10,200
So oftentimes we have overdoses that are categorized as happening at hospitals because that's where individuals are going.

313
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:17,240
If their if EMT comes or people are dropped off when we know that's not necessarily where the overdoses are occurring.

314
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:23,370
Right. And so does this data potentially skew that or are we just missing that information

315
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:28,370
completely because it's not coded or categorized where we draw on these records?

316
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:37,139
So so one of the things. Then we looked at who was like the way the variable is kind of like what kind of data that

317
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:40,710
the producer we looked at which just a regular head injury or traumatic head injury.

318
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:45,990
So the likelihood that at Michigan to break it down by age and race and gender.

319
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:53,960
And then the data was the same. So it's not like the variable itself is not clearly defined, I think, in the in that specific construct.

320
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,210
Yeah. Were you surprised by the number of categories that they had? Yes.

321
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:08,310
I mean, the level of specificity is is pretty impressive and true to almost to the extent of being unwieldy.

322
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:16,110
And I think it is important if folks in this room were already operating in this space or thinking from a level helplines, whatever, highly educated,

323
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:19,620
if we're struggling to interpret what some of these different codes mean or how

324
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:24,540
we're going to utilize this information or data that has some feasibility problems,

325
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:28,169
that has some how are we going to make this translatable so that anybody who wants to

326
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:32,010
try to understand relative risk or highlight a disparity wherever else it might be,

327
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:36,930
can use something without having to get into v01 .12.

328
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:44,340
Traumatic head injury while riding a cycle but struck by a three year and like a four wheelers you know that to that level of granularity.

329
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:53,189
Yeah so I looked at CDC wanted innovation. They gave me very broad categories without going too much into detail.

330
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:56,310
So I couldn't engage into, you know, what exactly that category is.

331
00:38:56,610 --> 00:39:00,710
So I probe around and they found this database links to everyone them.

332
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:07,110
It allows me to specifically say I want to look at the mechanism of injury for

333
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:13,350
para cyclists and I do find it genders and the age range is very specific.

334
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:20,850
Yeah. So that's why my name was very specifically for your age, but your kids age and particularly for pedal cyclist.

335
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:25,680
Yeah. And you can customize I mean within their kind of interface that same data,

336
00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:29,760
there are a few different links that are using the same underlying relational database.

337
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:34,620
So Abraham had pointed out that whiskers are so there's a violent death reporting system.

338
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:38,199
I think I actually have a link to it in these slides and other ways that people

339
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:44,279
will access or tap into this set of data that's populated relatively recently.

340
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:52,229
We have up through 2020 and it's well almost the end of 2022. And then you also see that you can even demarcate by where the state is coming from.

341
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:59,030
Is it coming from coroner or is it coming from other reports? We've been more critical.

342
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:03,440
Is there anything that was that's positive about having something like this available?

343
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,800
I have no idea how much it cost to run, but I imagine it's pretty expensive.

344
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:11,960
It's quite the investment by CDC. Do you see utility here? And if so, why?

345
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:16,110
What you can do with it. Thank you.

346
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:21,350
I mean, how are you to prevent injury? It's just a bunch of data. It's a whole bunch of suppressed cells.

347
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:29,070
How is this going to be valuable? You know where to start with.

348
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:33,710
This is not worthy of your money. What's the priority?

349
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:40,970
Okay, so it could be a cost effectiveness or scope of the problem type of starting place.

350
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:46,849
If you can show that this affects how many of the 400 million Americans each year over the last ten years

351
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:52,610
or maybe not as you have you have to you I'm just going to say like like if you're going to break it down,

352
00:40:52,610 --> 00:41:00,260
low income New York City like you can look at how serious a problem like let's say on a conceptual model where you need the money to do it.

353
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:02,630
Like you have the data to show that you have this.

354
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:08,080
This region specifically has a higher prevalence than the rest of the United States because of the problem.

355
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:15,020
We need the money to develop this to reduce that problem with that kind of data can be used to prove your case, I guess.

356
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:24,950
Right. And I mean, I think one of the things about the granularity can be a challenge, but you can also at least start to give a scope of the problem.

357
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:33,230
You know, if it's all psychology, every single code that has the word cycling in there might give you a better sense of when,

358
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:38,990
yeah, maybe we're not talking about when you get hit by a bus, but anybody who's ride a bike, this is how often it happens.

359
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:46,160
And this is why we want to have bicycle safety courses. This is why we want to have helmet laws with this, where whatever might be said to try to.

360
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:52,370
To try to highlight the extent of a problem. Yeah. What else?

361
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,760
Any other reactions to this data? Our database.

362
00:41:57,870 --> 00:42:01,649
Abramson. I don't know if you could use it alone to do this,

363
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:12,510
but I really do think you could use this as an example of where under-reporting happens and if that data, as you get more specific.

364
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:15,390
Like that data, it really isn't available.

365
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:24,500
Or if you're like demographically by a lot of data one I'm really can but not for another like it could provide evidence that.

366
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:29,370
There's under-reporting happening in various areas.

367
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:33,350
Yeah. So I've mentioned it twice before. Like intimate partner violence.

368
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:40,380
Can you just do a quick scan to figure out what they have here to categorize intimate partner violence is happened when you.

369
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:46,300
There he is. Your hand up. Your folks are searching. Oh, yeah.

370
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:53,020
I think of at that point of life, I definitely was the threshold when I saw those invocations.

371
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:59,410
And so that was a different environment.

372
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:08,019
Okay. Yeah. How do we know that there might be differences or or prevalence differences by certain certain demographics that we're going

373
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:16,450
to miss or we're going to over overshadow by the way that they are grouped based on their conceptualizations of race.

374
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:21,040
Let's see. Here they have they are female.

375
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:24,280
I know. I don't know what extent they have gender identity represented here.

376
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:34,660
We heard from Sarah that in the the transgender couples and students and individuals and often the upper under-represented whatever

377
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:40,170
the rates might be looking different depending on what certain happens or that they're going to be represented within this data.

378
00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:48,990
That's what really parallels this type of research with the Jews, like with mapping geospatial graphics.

379
00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:55,570
Mm hmm. And also, you know, specifically during the early 19th century and stuff.

380
00:43:55,590 --> 00:44:00,550
Fingerprints, right. That they were anticipated. And so you could very well.

381
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:10,680
Turns out they kind of monitoring trends. Yeah. I'll show you a slide a little bit later to talk about trends in environment for us.

382
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:18,460
We can have it without this one or two. Any other final reactions to?

383
00:44:19,770 --> 00:44:31,990
This wonder of the. Yeah.

384
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:35,930
Well, I hope it was at least interesting.

385
00:44:35,930 --> 00:44:42,690
It sounds like a lot of folks hadn't played around with it before. I encourage you to spend some time on it if you want it to.

386
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:46,430
You can look at all the different ways that they have to categorize.

387
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:50,170
You can play around with some different breakdowns and, you know,

388
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:58,010
think about whether or not you could utilize this for the kind of work that you want to do and what kind and what forms or what form it is.

389
00:44:58,010 --> 00:45:02,660
And you can acknowledge limitations and still say this is valuable because X, Y or Z, right?

390
00:45:02,990 --> 00:45:07,430
It's our right if our data are imperfect. Better to have at least some of this information.

391
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:15,950
At least I can go back to Gavin and say, you know, based on my results, which I think are gone now, how many was like 33 or something like that,

392
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:22,550
and looked like the relative risk of dying by a cycling accident was pretty close to walking out there in a windstorm in the woods.

393
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:28,430
So can I make my case for him or can he make his case back to me and say, you know what?

394
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:31,550
If I'm if I shouldn't be doing that, then I also shouldn't be riding my bike then.

395
00:45:33,050 --> 00:45:36,860
Or I might just say, well, you need a helmet and nice little bright neon vest there.

396
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:42,320
Yeah. But I think, like, obviously there's so many factors and somebody gets injured and we're talking

397
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:47,240
about somebody who's biking and like where you are also matters because like,

398
00:45:47,390 --> 00:45:51,740
do you have bike lanes? Are you driving in the street? Are there so well, are you at a park?

399
00:45:51,770 --> 00:45:56,659
What is there a river like? There are tons of things that like influences.

400
00:45:56,660 --> 00:46:04,270
But I think like I think like, you know, you can also like just walk through the woods, like with a helmet, just observant of what's going on.

401
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:11,090
The wind is getting a lot. You're seeing a lot of trees like bending over like maybe it's time to go outside, maybe not right now.

402
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:18,440
And that and that's it's a great time to take that mindset and then we can think about and see what's happening prior to when,

403
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:24,800
you know, the injury might happen or at the time of or falling, you can think about who is involved.

404
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:28,189
We could think about the mechanism of injury. We could think about the social context.

405
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:32,239
We could think about the physical context. Does this ring a bell? Yeah. Yeah, right.

406
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:33,580
So, I mean, we can populate,

407
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:41,720
we can think about through how we might then start to tailor our intervention based on where these injuries are occurring.

408
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:46,730
And if our CDC or database can help us guide or direct some of that, that's fabulous.

409
00:46:46,730 --> 00:46:50,000
And why not utilize a resource like this exist?

410
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:56,060
All right, folks, so that you want to take a little break.

411
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:02,420
Yeah, I stick to medicine. We'll come back. We'll talk a little bit about violence.

412
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:11,928
Yes. You'll see at 1235.

413
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:21,950
But yeah. So your question, were the parents informed? So it is incredibly varied, but I would say that the vast majority are not.

414
00:47:22,310 --> 00:47:30,080
The schools that we work with do not do a great job of telling either parents or students a lot about these drills.

415
00:47:30,350 --> 00:47:32,690
Oftentimes it kind of comes prepackaged as a training.

416
00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:38,720
Again, if it's something that's mandatory or mandated by the district, we want you to do these things three times over the semester.

417
00:47:39,050 --> 00:47:44,930
They check those boxes and then they're done with it. So I can't say that all of that none of the parents were informed,

418
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:47,960
but the majority of the ones that we've interacted with, parents don't know about it.

419
00:47:48,290 --> 00:47:51,160
Yeah, I just feel like when you hear this with like everything out,

420
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:56,350
like we did tornado drills growing up and everything, like, and then this became part of the threat.

421
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:59,419
When you're packaging that all together and you're telling parents, like,

422
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:02,990
we're doing tornado drills and fire drills and now we're doing lockdown drills like that.

423
00:48:03,110 --> 00:48:10,440
That sounds reasonable from a perspective of like all tornado drills help people be safe in tornado writing.

424
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:15,090
Like what kind of. Yeah. And so.

425
00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:20,190
And also someone who works with schools. Thinking about the packets of information that parents get.

426
00:48:20,190 --> 00:48:24,750
That explain what these all these things are for and how much people pay attention to it.

427
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:28,800
It might be something that catches your eye if you're not familiar with these, if you hadn't done it before.

428
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:33,210
If against a shooting at school had been salient, you might spend a little bit of time reading it.

429
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:38,760
But I still think that there are opportunities at the time of these drills, both to talk to the parents, know that they're happening,

430
00:48:38,970 --> 00:48:45,630
and also debrief with students in school and perhaps give them some talking points for parents at home to say, how are you feeling about this?

431
00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:51,600
And again, if this is happening from kindergarten through 12th grade,

432
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:56,490
the conversation looks quite a bit different if you're talking to your second grader than if you're talking to your 10th grader.

433
00:48:56,970 --> 00:49:00,210
And how can schools help kind of facilitate those conversations?

434
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:04,070
Right. Rachel. Rachel.

435
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:12,110
So I had two questions for this data. Was it just like K through 12 students or answering this question?

436
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:17,180
These are good question. These are 11 or 1230.

437
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:24,220
So these are all and they're middle score items. And then I don't know if this is more of a good question or just a comment.

438
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:31,100
I don't know if it would make a difference if the curriculum was standardized for active shooter.

439
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:39,790
Maybe like even before debriefing, like giving students sort of like a practice of what is to come because I don't know,

440
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:42,960
that would make them feel safer necessarily. And I have no idea.

441
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:47,150
Like when you were talking about how some schools do these drills,

442
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:52,690
I was completely shocked because I never even thought that there would be so much variation within right after.

443
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:55,700
Sure. So I don't know if that point to.

444
00:49:58,020 --> 00:50:00,929
Yeah. And we're trying we're trying to do a little bit of that.

445
00:50:00,930 --> 00:50:08,850
So yeah, some of this is born from I don't know if you had like alcohol, beer, education programs like that.

446
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,280
There's, there have been situations where they take like a wrecked car,

447
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:15,720
somebody who's been in actually like a motor vehicle actually while intoxicated and they pass it on to the school.

448
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:18,600
And it's supposed to be a scare tactic. There was a similar program.

449
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:24,990
So, you know, I think it is trying to reconceptualize how we're we're sharing this information.

450
00:50:25,290 --> 00:50:30,540
And I think to your point, developing best practices, which apparently do not exist, is critical.

451
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:36,300
It might not mean standardizing the programs across because there are a lot of different people developing trainings around this space.

452
00:50:36,690 --> 00:50:42,870
But having a couple of of what to do and what not to do, I think would be really important.

453
00:50:42,870 --> 00:50:46,229
And there's a little bit of writing on this, just a teeny bit of writing right now.

454
00:50:46,230 --> 00:50:50,850
It's mostly theoretical. Now it's time to try to back it up a little bit of data and some research.

455
00:50:51,060 --> 00:51:04,310
But I just wanted to comment that first they were using the word trauma and uh, stress is not always about my kids to be stressed about this.

456
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:09,389
Sure, they will know what to do because if they are stressed, they will be more aware of that.

457
00:51:09,390 --> 00:51:11,940
They will know what to do. I don't want them stressed after it happens.

458
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:15,840
If it happens, I do want them stressed before it happens so that they will know what to do.

459
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:21,809
I will just share something good. There is a stress activation curve for sure.

460
00:51:21,810 --> 00:51:25,170
Credit. If you're not here, you're under stress or if you're overstressed.

461
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:33,000
But you're trying to find that sweet spot. Yeah, sure. But we were in a big explosion and Lebanon.

462
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:37,710
And, um, the explosion was a part of two explosions.

463
00:51:37,710 --> 00:51:46,230
One explosion. And then after 5 minutes, there was a bigger one because everyone there who was already in the war already knew what to do.

464
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:53,610
I wasn't the only me. I got my kids in like 3 seconds, and we were the only place that basically didn't got damage in our house.

465
00:51:53,820 --> 00:52:03,270
And that's how we survived. And most of the people that actually didn't get hurt were actually not of these is people who did not the Lebanese,

466
00:52:03,270 --> 00:52:07,110
but they grew up, for example, in Canada. So they didn't have that stress.

467
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:11,220
They didn't act as fast and it's hurt them.

468
00:52:11,370 --> 00:52:18,410
And I'm not saying it's bad, but I'm saying some stress is not always is not always like but they should do

469
00:52:18,450 --> 00:52:23,410
stress that they should be worried about the stress that comes after the Gulf,

470
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:25,049
after there's a shooting.

471
00:52:25,050 --> 00:52:33,870
The media is all over the right about the stress of the kids because what they care before that some rule is going to hurt their feelings.

472
00:52:34,310 --> 00:52:37,860
Oh. Who sponsors.

473
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:42,910
Yes. So I know these are wildly different.

474
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:49,240
Um, but after World War Two, there was a lot of concern for their lives.

475
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:59,350
And this is just one of history classes. Like there was, there were drills like duck and cover where you were told, like,

476
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:05,380
if the nuclear bomb were to go off in L.A., your day needs to be duck and cover.

477
00:53:05,950 --> 00:53:12,670
That has been shown not to be the thing to do. The best thing to do is like to get away there.

478
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:20,860
Like you have like there's a ton of things that you have to do. But kids and schools told parents, right, this is what's got to do.

479
00:53:21,310 --> 00:53:24,430
I need to have a bunker made of metal that is safe. Okay.

480
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:29,560
Well, that can put you more at risk in being in a because someone does something differently.

481
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:36,880
But some of them were just metal and nuclear energy does heat things up pretty quickly so that could harm people.

482
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:41,770
And so I'm seeing like this, like there's been no evidence for duck and cover to be like, this is great.

483
00:53:41,770 --> 00:53:48,390
It will protect kids in the case of a nuclear bomb. But then we have firearms where it's not coming from this guy.

484
00:53:48,490 --> 00:53:52,990
There's something going into the school. And again, we don't have a lot of evidence to say it's good.

485
00:53:53,380 --> 00:54:01,690
But parents and overwhelmingly, I think people who go to school trust the adults, lead it and saying, well, this is what we can do.

486
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:05,380
They trust that those people have researched or know what they're doing.

487
00:54:06,210 --> 00:54:08,570
There's like this. I don't know what to call it.

488
00:54:08,590 --> 00:54:15,430
There must be a bias word for this to have a boring phrase and that the people are saying like fire appeal to authority.

489
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:19,080
Yes. Like that's not good.

490
00:54:19,090 --> 00:54:22,000
I don't know. Like, I know knowledge isn't everything,

491
00:54:22,570 --> 00:54:33,700
but I think like the trust people place in authority and then authority not like not recalling it or being aware,

492
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:39,190
like, oh, they probably assume that I know this works or that I think it works, right?

493
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:45,760
Or they know it doesn't work, but it's something and it's better to look like you're doing something than nothing.

494
00:54:46,690 --> 00:54:52,920
And like. So I'm just like, wondering, like, there has to be something better going on because, like, I do think drills are good.

495
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:57,610
I do think stress is a normal part for people for not for the most part.

496
00:54:58,330 --> 00:55:03,640
But I think like if you're going to be tight, like have stress and so like know what to do,

497
00:55:03,970 --> 00:55:10,690
those things should be things that at least do more than a maybe because it maybe is good.

498
00:55:10,750 --> 00:55:14,200
It's really good if it's between like being alive or not a lot.

499
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:19,870
Okay. What if the other option is like, yes, there if you like go here.

500
00:55:20,290 --> 00:55:23,930
It's this because like they have a little rules.

501
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:31,810
Like if that's more of an idea or if it's like anti-bullying, like programs like like having community building,

502
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:42,489
if that's more effective and preventing like people deciding or people learning how to like Puerto Ricans, is that more than like those?

503
00:55:42,490 --> 00:55:47,530
Like knowing what is effective and then people not knowing the people who are in charge,

504
00:55:47,530 --> 00:55:56,320
if people in charge don't know if it actually works, like it just feels like a lot of like with blind spots and too many blind spots.

505
00:55:56,500 --> 00:56:02,710
Yes. So I would say definitely many blind spots, which is part of why I guess this is going to be happening.

506
00:56:02,710 --> 00:56:07,560
Research is that somehow children are just going to come to us.

507
00:56:07,610 --> 00:56:16,030
So the first one is about the distribution of the data and how that could be correlated to what we've done with things like stress and in general,

508
00:56:16,030 --> 00:56:19,830
like the physiological response to certain problem.

509
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:27,280
It's like maybe like the data is distributed because like parents, naturally they, you know, they care for the well-being of their child.

510
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:33,580
So they're going to want to do everything that they can to make sure that their child's safety is top priority.

511
00:56:34,030 --> 00:56:40,299
But then when you look at the kids, like if you're telling the kids that and I personally experienced this myself,

512
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:45,580
it's like if you're telling people that they're going to have a drill, there is no actual stressor there.

513
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:49,030
It's like there is no threat. So you're not going to take it seriously.

514
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:57,640
Okay. So that was my personal response. And then kind of like a psycho to I think like stress is good.

515
00:56:57,910 --> 00:57:04,629
It's like any kind of experience where you can, I guess, classify trauma as like, for example, let's say,

516
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:12,700
and I actually felt a little bit when I was in undergrad, almost like for example, I was in anatomy and physiology class.

517
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:19,450
And on the first exam on my review period, I did a study two weeks before the exam and I, I did not do that great.

518
00:57:19,450 --> 00:57:21,849
I think I like people to understand like that,

519
00:57:21,850 --> 00:57:29,049
but I'm studying 3 to 4 days before the exam where the stress was like the highest and didn't really know exactly what was going on.

520
00:57:29,050 --> 00:57:31,930
But because I felt that sense of urgency, the stress was there.

521
00:57:32,590 --> 00:57:38,290
I mean, I like really I did better than others and I feel like having like a control them on the stress.

522
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:42,800
Good. I'll see you then. Yeah.

523
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:46,940
You like this? They would tell us ahead of time. Okay, guys, we're going to have a drill.

524
00:57:47,330 --> 00:57:54,770
And like my teachers, like, at the time, they were laughing about it, but they're like, okay, guys, we're going to have to turn off the lights.

525
00:57:54,770 --> 00:57:57,900
They're like, they just do like flashing the lights on.

526
00:57:57,910 --> 00:58:03,590
We're just like, Oh, my God. Like, so it wasn't really like, I look at it from back then to now.

527
00:58:03,950 --> 00:58:08,780
It's totally different. It is legit. Like, people are like, I never heard of the people reenact.

528
00:58:09,350 --> 00:58:14,450
You look in the halls and there's but I remember when I never or like they used when I was

529
00:58:14,510 --> 00:58:19,460
little they use puppets they use like do they had puppets like display like they were like,

530
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:24,559
you know, reenacting everything like smoking and bullying and stuff like that.

531
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:29,870
So it's just, it's just crazy how it alters now and it makes my perspective change.

532
00:58:29,870 --> 00:58:37,790
I'm like, I didn't do it as a parent because of protocol for practitioners related to prevention, which you guys should.

533
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:46,850
But no, but yeah, it's just, it makes you think that they should be like, how has this changed over time?

534
00:58:47,810 --> 00:58:51,510
It is in the building and some of these different drills that has its through kind of, I think,

535
00:58:51,630 --> 00:58:59,480
signature efforts in law enforcement that we're pushing the we need to understand how people are going to react in an emergency situation,

536
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:03,130
which is why some of these tools were developed, but very good.

537
00:59:04,270 --> 00:59:12,290
Yeah, you think so? One of your clients simulating these things is it's not.

538
00:59:12,830 --> 00:59:21,320
The threat is real. So you can't really say, like, this drill is going to make sure that your child will know what to do if there's a shooting out.

539
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:26,640
Because, like, what if they're not in the classroom? I'm wondering about what are they supposed to do?

540
00:59:26,820 --> 00:59:34,290
You know, you never know how it's going to work. And also, I think it's kind of my concern to stress what it's like.

541
00:59:34,530 --> 00:59:39,790
What how is the stress manifesting, particularly if it's a situation where it's like they're doing this whole performance artist,

542
00:59:39,810 --> 00:59:44,040
like people being laying on the ground and taking it to these extreme situations.

543
00:59:44,490 --> 00:59:52,020
Like that's definitely going to be probably veering more towards a level of stress, but also it's a cumulative stress because, you know,

544
00:59:52,290 --> 00:59:55,499
you're going through these shooting drills on top of whatever they're dealing with the school,

545
00:59:55,500 --> 01:00:00,770
on top of whatever was getting bullied or have other issues or one of these issues happening outside of the home.

546
01:00:00,810 --> 01:00:03,870
Like it's sort of more so.

547
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:09,350
I understand you want to have your children concerned about it, also taking it seriously.

548
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:15,000
And understanding that it's something that they should have concern for.

549
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:18,870
But what I'm learning, like as we're talking about it now,

550
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:25,470
customers have been more important to how can we make this something that doesn't create stress?

551
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:30,060
To the extent word interferes with their ability to function more so as a program

552
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:34,890
that will allow them to understand it as something they need to take seriously.

553
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:41,490
Because also, you know, the thing what very little you know, for example, when I was in first grade about something like this,

554
01:00:41,820 --> 01:00:50,430
I don't think of it more as I'm not doing this to be heard about because I can't understand the level of nuance that comes into school shootings.

555
01:00:51,540 --> 01:00:57,940
My son was here and there was a it was a deer trying to get into here.

556
01:00:58,650 --> 01:01:09,080
And so these comments and I, I feel like people have a every in the classroom, especially in those schools,

557
01:01:09,090 --> 01:01:13,040
you know, have different ways of how they want to go about, you know, keeping.

558
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:24,000
And I think this is just from my perspective, I think it's almost unfair by all the schools to figure out what is best because like,

559
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:29,669
is that in the job description or the measure that, you know, you are, first of all,

560
01:01:29,670 --> 01:01:35,460
not traumatizing your students by trying to keep them safe and figuring out what's like the best,

561
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:41,309
the best for how to make them understand how serious something is and also not taking

562
01:01:41,310 --> 01:01:45,010
away their sense of childhood and like the way that they view the world as well.

563
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:52,620
So for me, listening to like everybody's arguments or like their comments about how, you know,

564
01:01:53,130 --> 01:01:58,680
stress and things like that, it's just I think it's dancing around a root cause, which doesn't lie within.

565
01:02:00,110 --> 01:02:06,919
Okay. Rachel, I was just going to add to that some of this stress might not even necessarily

566
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:11,180
come from the drill itself that might be dependent on the time and place.

567
01:02:11,180 --> 01:02:17,780
Because, like, depending on how old the student is, they could have been exposed to a very recent school shooting.

568
01:02:17,810 --> 01:02:24,770
Right. Right. That might be stressing about. So the drill itself might not like put that like anxiety in their mind.

569
01:02:24,770 --> 01:02:30,590
But just, you know, these events do happen in real time and kids do.

570
01:02:31,130 --> 01:02:36,260
See that. So if you do not mind as well as a factor of their stress.

571
01:02:37,490 --> 01:02:45,080
What? I just want to say about that. I don't mean that there's a make it sorry if you don't like it, because I don't agree with that.

572
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:50,170
I just think they should know that or share them with some of our patients.

573
01:02:50,660 --> 01:02:57,510
I also want to comment about the use of dramatized words because I know it's out of context.

574
01:02:57,510 --> 01:03:05,790
But when I first came to the US after the explosion, my first ever conversation was with someone at the park and mom.

575
01:03:05,790 --> 01:03:17,070
And she was telling me that all this next visit for her kids during COVID and I feel like I cannot make a conversation like,

576
01:03:17,150 --> 01:03:20,200
you know, like, what do you mean traumatized by all this vaccine?

577
01:03:20,250 --> 01:03:23,900
Like and we just came from the explosion of, like, my kids.

578
01:03:23,910 --> 01:03:25,740
I can't even tell you what they went through.

579
01:03:25,860 --> 01:03:32,910
So sometimes just like be more aware of when you visit because you would do areas of people want to be open.

580
01:03:34,620 --> 01:03:38,030
I can understand where that's coming from at the same time and the awareness piece.

581
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:41,819
I mean, one of the things that we do we often think about is schools aren't always able

582
01:03:41,820 --> 01:03:44,940
to recognize when students have a history of terror or trauma in their life.

583
01:03:44,940 --> 01:03:48,809
So it might be very different that I have to verify if it's something that

584
01:03:48,810 --> 01:03:52,170
you've never been exposed to or versus something that you have been exposed to.

585
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:58,800
And it might be very different to have a police officer in the building that's armed if you have a differential experience with police officers.

586
01:03:59,220 --> 01:04:03,990
So I think trauma informed does not necessarily imply that everyone is going to be traumatized

587
01:04:03,990 --> 01:04:07,920
by the drills being used to understand that it could happen and to be on the lookout for Karen.

588
01:04:08,790 --> 01:04:16,050
Yeah, I don't know, just on this vein, or maybe the trainings being concentrated more outside of the school system.

589
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:21,690
Mm hmm. Like, is there some sort of analysis that's been done on how many deaths per semester?

590
01:04:21,690 --> 01:04:25,170
But it has. The school resource officers responded appropriately.

591
01:04:27,510 --> 01:04:34,340
Yeah. You know, they do nothing or, you know, based on the situation.

592
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:41,909
So I love the school because it is really I'm so happy we got to have this conversation.

593
01:04:41,910 --> 01:04:43,200
This is this is our challenge.

594
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:51,510
So I want to treat any technical assistance that schools look to us to help them potentially help guide their implementation of safety activities.

595
01:04:51,870 --> 01:04:55,920
And one of the things that people talk to us about is whether or not we should do these lockdown drills.

596
01:04:56,220 --> 01:04:59,880
And if you we've raised multiple issues. One, should we do them at all?

597
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:02,159
And then, two, if we do do them,

598
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:08,370
how are we going to do them more effectively or way that's going to be conscious of the students that are experiencing them?

599
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:10,590
I will tell you, that was very aware of my numbers.

600
01:05:10,950 --> 01:05:18,270
1999 through about 2019, there were about I wanted to find out about 48 mass shooting school shootings within schools.

601
01:05:19,770 --> 01:05:25,230
There are, let's see, about 130,000 or 30,000 schools in inner city public schools in the states.

602
01:05:26,130 --> 01:05:29,700
Eight is a year, school days a year. 20 years.

603
01:05:30,210 --> 01:05:34,680
It's about 450 million school days a year and about 50 school shootings.

604
01:05:35,130 --> 01:05:39,180
So the likelihood that you're going to have a mass shooting event in your school is about one in 10 million.

605
01:05:40,110 --> 01:05:47,130
One in 10 million. And yet are we going to devote how much time, energy, space to something like this?

606
01:05:48,330 --> 01:05:51,900
That's kind of a question about whether or not these are the right approach.

607
01:05:52,060 --> 01:05:55,190
Are there in other ways that we should be informing this? How much does it cost?

608
01:05:55,200 --> 01:06:02,220
What is the human cost? What are the economic costs? How do you how do I make the case to these parents who say,

609
01:06:02,550 --> 01:06:07,740
I want to have lockdown drills in my school, I want to have an SRO armed in my school building.

610
01:06:08,100 --> 01:06:11,550
Right. How is this going to fit for every single school community?

611
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:15,780
These are the types of things that we grapple with and we're trying to to inform the

612
01:06:15,790 --> 01:06:20,489
conversation with some of the research I'm going to talk to you about in just a second. Do people want to do these things?

613
01:06:20,490 --> 01:06:25,660
Do they even take them seriously? Have they really thought about how these things play out in practice?

614
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:28,830
If the fire alarm went off in this building like it did on Tuesday?

615
01:06:29,130 --> 01:06:35,310
What would everybody in this room do? Yeah, there was a fire alarm went off.

616
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:44,220
Oh, we didn't know what to was, you know, I said, you know, so there was this there was a situation in Virginia where students pulled the fire alarm,

617
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:47,340
ran outside, waited for everybody come out, start shooting.

618
01:06:49,530 --> 01:06:55,170
Well, whatever lockdown drills tell us to do, what would our emergency response tell us to do?

619
01:06:55,740 --> 01:06:57,660
Is that going to be every student, every situation?

620
01:06:58,350 --> 01:07:05,729
So trying to think through how are we going to respond in these different situations and how do we as boy, is it the teacher's job?

621
01:07:05,730 --> 01:07:06,870
Is it the principal's job?

622
01:07:06,870 --> 01:07:14,130
Is it an outside facilitator or a mother or media consultant who is going to help us think through some of these situations?

623
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:16,290
And this is, again, just one facet of violence.

624
01:07:16,290 --> 01:07:22,440
And we talked about we also saw that bullying happens, that there are other forms that violence can kind of creep into our school communities.

625
01:07:25,510 --> 01:07:31,300
I see what I'm doing. Yeah. So let's see here.

626
01:07:32,350 --> 01:07:38,470
I wanted to try to figure out and these same same kind of questions when I was in Miami one year when the lockdown drill happened, wasn't it?

627
01:07:38,650 --> 01:07:42,400
It was. I wasn't expecting it to happen, but sure enough, it was in the village and we got lockdown.

628
01:07:42,790 --> 01:07:48,460
And I was in the library at the time and they shut all the doors to turn off all the lights.

629
01:07:48,670 --> 01:07:51,240
You know, you could hear some kids, some students giggling, you know,

630
01:07:51,250 --> 01:07:54,340
after a little bit of time passed, somebody came walking by, pounded on the door,

631
01:07:54,610 --> 01:08:02,019
wanted to see how students were going to respond, even if the people got quiet and then they kind of left and then somebody came by a church general,

632
01:08:02,020 --> 01:08:07,329
the door, of course, one of the doors of the lot. So they were able to get into the door and so that was a good but so the

633
01:08:07,330 --> 01:08:11,380
implementation and actually the fidelity with which these things are manifesting,

634
01:08:11,590 --> 01:08:17,500
we're all questions that kind of sparked into my head. So I wanted to try to understand again how students were experiencing these things.

635
01:08:17,770 --> 01:08:22,300
We're doing different iterations now. We're asking more involved or specific questions.

636
01:08:22,570 --> 01:08:28,060
But at least in this case, I saw this was in Miami. The lockdown just made me feel safe and it's scary.

637
01:08:28,300 --> 01:08:32,230
And are people treating them seriously for some of the same things that folks were bringing up in your conversation?

638
01:08:32,230 --> 01:08:35,650
This is why I love this question a lot. But you're engaging in this material this way.

639
01:08:37,510 --> 01:08:40,990
Lockdown drills increase feelings of safety. Interesting.

640
01:08:41,540 --> 01:08:48,430
Right. The interaction that we saw here, the moderation here was whether or not people thought they were scared.

641
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:53,190
So I kind of think about it as form and function, the function of a drill.

642
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:58,630
Students recognize why they're doing these things, that this is intended to make sure that there is not a school shooting.

643
01:08:58,930 --> 01:09:03,190
Now, granted, this was in 2019, 20/21 when it happened in 2017.

644
01:09:03,430 --> 01:09:08,589
So maybe this population was a little bit more salient. But they recognize that having drills could be important.

645
01:09:08,590 --> 01:09:13,960
It might keep you safe. But they didn't like when they felt scared because for whatever reason,

646
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:18,180
if they were scary to them, how they were implemented, these were mandatory drills.

647
01:09:18,490 --> 01:09:24,879
The drills that we did was announced about, you know, about 30 seconds, about a minute before everybody had to go to their room.

648
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:29,950
They had designated corners and safe corners within their different classrooms and everybody kind of clustered together.

649
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:31,960
So that was just one example.

650
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:37,180
But when we did find that they were scary, that's when people started to have some of these negative mental health outcomes.

651
01:09:37,630 --> 01:09:46,360
So these drills can have a positive benefit. But my my assumption and what I'm trying to test now is when you do simulate gunshots

652
01:09:46,660 --> 01:09:49,990
or when you do make it look like there's somebody that's injured in the hallway,

653
01:09:50,230 --> 01:10:00,090
that's not a good thing. Right? There's a there is a level of reality that can make these things very scary and harmful for students that.

654
01:10:01,930 --> 01:10:04,719
So let's see here. This is one of the things we're testing now.

655
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:09,790
We're actually just kind of finished writing up was how students utilize an anonymous reporting system.

656
01:10:09,790 --> 01:10:17,320
So in addition to, you know, lockdown drills, are there other ways or upstream ways you can't give us precedent in this whole talk, which is great.

657
01:10:17,950 --> 01:10:24,580
Are there ways that we can start thinking about safety that wouldn't necessarily involve some of these activities if we're not sure if they even work,

658
01:10:25,270 --> 01:10:28,150
we're not even sure how the likelihood that people are going to need to use them.

659
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:32,380
The reason why I like anonymous reporting systems is that there is not just

660
01:10:32,710 --> 01:10:36,090
school shootings in the way that we think about them in terms of media sirens.

661
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:41,110
Right. There are lots of different things that are reasons why students use an honest reporting systems,

662
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:48,910
even though they were developed to prevent then the next part, the next Sandy Hook, the next Virginia Tech.

663
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:54,130
Right. People use them to talk about concerns they have about their friend who might commit suicide.

664
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:57,910
They do. They use them to talk about someone who is getting bullied.

665
01:10:58,120 --> 01:11:01,600
They use them to talk about themselves and some of their problems that they're experiencing.

666
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:06,760
So when we look at these different anonymous reporting systems, and there's one in Michigan, Pollack is saying there's some.

667
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:11,440
In Colorado, there's some actually about half of states require these reporting systems.

668
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:18,880
Now, the top 3 to 5 incidents that people are calling in for have nothing to do with an active school shooter.

669
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:22,780
Right. It's often mental health related. It's bullying related.

670
01:11:23,410 --> 01:11:28,330
It's different forms of engaging with concerns. And so can we utilize something like this?

671
01:11:28,690 --> 01:11:34,870
So in this case, we were testing the training. Whether or not having a system that was paired with this is what the system is.

672
01:11:35,110 --> 01:11:38,739
This is how you're going to use it. This is one we think you should use it.

673
01:11:38,740 --> 01:11:44,350
This is what you should recognize. Would that make a difference in terms of kind of student outcomes?

674
01:11:45,130 --> 01:11:50,050
So I think I've shown you this model before, but you know, by implementing a program,

675
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:55,180
do we see some of these changes in people's recognition of risk, willingness to report their risk?

676
01:11:55,540 --> 01:11:59,680
By doing so, we should be able to see some of these decreases in violent outcomes.

677
01:12:00,010 --> 01:12:03,610
We also thinks that if we have, you know, more monitoring within the environment,

678
01:12:03,940 --> 01:12:10,120
so this is kind of like peer to peer surveillance that you're going to have people recognizing that this is a more inclusive climate,

679
01:12:10,810 --> 01:12:12,400
that this and people are looking out for me,

680
01:12:12,730 --> 01:12:19,420
we might see this kind of indirect relationship between some of these individual changes and what's right now.

681
01:12:19,420 --> 01:12:24,010
Consider what we found.

682
01:12:25,110 --> 01:12:29,770
We're pretty positive. So when I think people were exposed to this program,

683
01:12:30,270 --> 01:12:36,870
they were able to recognize warning signs their self-efficacy an intention man that sounds like HPT to report went way up.

684
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:42,810
We were interested to see the spikes in tips. So after the end of the program was the training happened.

685
01:12:43,050 --> 01:12:46,860
We saw that they expected tips. And then they really started to kind of fizzle off.

686
01:12:47,190 --> 01:12:51,599
So if you're thinking about right, maybe lockdown drills are not what I want to be doing in my schools.

687
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:55,950
Maybe an anonymous reporting system that doesn't have some of these concerns could be a better option.

688
01:12:56,370 --> 01:12:59,340
How do we sustain interest and willingness to utilize that system?

689
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:07,140
What are the what are the first types of things that people what would make them more or less likely to use the app, the phone or whatever?

690
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:11,430
Incidentally, if you look at the ratings of some of these anonymous reporting apps, they're really terrible.

691
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:15,320
They're like one out of five stars. I mean, I don't know.

692
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:18,030
Banks have better ratings than one out of five stars,

693
01:13:18,750 --> 01:13:23,610
but I'm trying to think about ways that are going to make them relevant to students or integrate into other apps.

694
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:32,130
We did see some changes in violent outcomes and some of these positive outcomes consistent with that conceptual.

695
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:38,390
So one way to think about if we're not sure about the evidence base for lockdown drills,

696
01:13:38,490 --> 01:13:44,190
we don't think they should be implemented quite as widely or as variably as they currently are.

697
01:13:44,700 --> 01:13:52,480
What can we offer as a as an alternative? Questions about this or this.

698
01:13:57,350 --> 01:14:02,629
I don't know. I don't know. I think it's interesting. Whoops. There's another one.

699
01:14:02,630 --> 01:14:08,330
And boy, I feel if you've been listening to me all semester. You would think this one would be a whopping success.

700
01:14:08,330 --> 01:14:19,310
Because we're taking three evidence based programs, three, four, three evidence based programs, and we're focusing in on work.

701
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:23,150
This is working. And we were working up in Flint. We had Genesee County.

702
01:14:23,480 --> 01:14:26,480
We had 20 schools. There were four through six grades.

703
01:14:27,020 --> 01:14:29,899
Restorative practices are very, very widely implemented.

704
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:37,760
The idea is to move away from exclusionary discipline and find ways to mitigate conflict before it escalates to violence.

705
01:14:38,060 --> 01:14:45,650
Mental health first aid is really just looking for folks that might be suffering from mental director challenges.

706
01:14:45,890 --> 01:14:52,080
So that's educating our teachers and administrators and bus drivers and cafeteria folks to maybe to

707
01:14:52,160 --> 01:14:57,739
to identify students before things escalator become problematic hypertension through final design.

708
01:14:57,740 --> 01:15:04,040
I think I'm going to talk about this more before, but this is the physical environment, what you can change in terms of lines of sight.

709
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:07,700
If you place somebody in the hallway, they can see the entire hallway.

710
01:15:07,700 --> 01:15:12,299
That's very different than somebody that are rolling out in the hallway and corner.

711
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:21,440
Or you can see not only down that whole hallway as well as this whole hallway, think about bushes and shrubbery that might conceal folks or dark,

712
01:15:22,190 --> 01:15:26,720
dark corners of the school or bathrooms that people don't want to go to all the physical locations.

713
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:32,510
So the idea was if we can implement something like this through evidence based programs, through the kitchen sink at it,

714
01:15:32,870 --> 01:15:38,930
we would see changes in climate which would reduce violence, changes in climate, improve mental health, also reduce violence.

715
01:15:39,590 --> 01:15:44,830
Long story short, I'm sorry, it's not funny, but it's not.

716
01:15:47,330 --> 01:15:53,809
And I guess the good news is the control schools were just we didn't see super high levels of violence across any of the schools.

717
01:15:53,810 --> 01:15:57,980
That could be because we were like in elementary schools. This was also confronted by COVID.

718
01:15:57,980 --> 01:16:02,420
So it hit right in the middle, I guess, towards the end of it at the end of this project.

719
01:16:03,620 --> 01:16:07,129
But it's an interesting one. I've been telling you, let's develop that evidence base.

720
01:16:07,130 --> 01:16:12,290
Let's find some of these programs that we know work. And maybe the idea is to translate or to scale them.

721
01:16:12,950 --> 01:16:17,360
We tried to translate this and it didn't work and we're trying to figure out maybe why,

722
01:16:17,690 --> 01:16:21,890
but pretty much across any of our measures, it just was not work.

723
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:24,680
So it's a different kind of finding.

724
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:31,790
I think it's a different sort of block to where I can contribute to an evidence base, but not the one in the way that they were expecting.

725
01:16:32,540 --> 01:16:38,390
If you want me to give you my, my, my gut opinion, teachers do not like this at all.

726
01:16:38,540 --> 01:16:45,319
They said that they didn't get enough training. They didn't feel like they had the self legacy to actually talk to students about their

727
01:16:45,320 --> 01:16:48,920
mental health despite they were like a day and a half of training or something like that.

728
01:16:49,310 --> 01:16:54,200
This we did not implement especially well. That's nearly with the fidelity that we thought we were going to,

729
01:16:54,890 --> 01:16:59,570
mostly because there was supposed to be a pretty big investment, like $10,000 for them to do some physical changes.

730
01:17:00,260 --> 01:17:04,879
$10,000 is nice, but when we talk to principals and superintendents, they're like, it's nice,

731
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:11,180
but it's not nearly what we want to do to change some of these dark haired physical buildings and spaces.

732
01:17:11,810 --> 01:17:19,010
And so the investment would need to be a lot higher. And then we also had an economic analysis, a cost benefit analysis to talk through that.

733
01:17:19,010 --> 01:17:21,020
So this was already a pretty expensive intervention.

734
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:27,860
And if you're going to spend $75,000 instead of $10,000, what does that mean for your choices in terms of, well,

735
01:17:27,860 --> 01:17:34,910
I could run mental health first aid, so the cows come home with $75,000 or the one that seemed to be really effective restorative practices.

736
01:17:35,570 --> 01:17:39,020
Sure. I'm sorry to plug off this program and it works.

737
01:17:39,020 --> 01:17:42,320
Guess that it did not work. So why?

738
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:49,600
What was the decision and having the teachers for this and not having social workers, therapists,

739
01:17:49,610 --> 01:17:55,400
psychologists, psychologists, people who like this is this is what they go for, right?

740
01:17:55,490 --> 01:17:59,210
This is the tutoring is like. Yeah, I just wondering like, why not?

741
01:17:59,210 --> 01:18:02,329
Like, yeah, fair point. Um, counselors.

742
01:18:02,330 --> 01:18:05,540
So again, thinking that these are all kind of evidence based programs,

743
01:18:06,410 --> 01:18:15,380
we took a school kind of specialist who was either social worker or had training in like psychologists or something like that.

744
01:18:15,650 --> 01:18:23,540
We took a, a member of the school staff and we had school resource officers and they created a three person leadership team.

745
01:18:23,870 --> 01:18:27,820
And their job was to take this information that they learned.

746
01:18:27,830 --> 01:18:29,180
And they were trained as trainers, trainers,

747
01:18:29,180 --> 01:18:35,330
trainers and worked with a with a consultant and helped to disseminate that information to their school communities.

748
01:18:35,690 --> 01:18:43,400
So it was a train, the trainer type of model thinking that those three, those three facets of the school would be represented.

749
01:18:43,490 --> 01:18:46,970
Know law enforcement. You had mental health, you had school representatives.

750
01:18:48,050 --> 01:18:52,340
That could be part of it. So we had a lot of chance to talk to those three person leadership teams and the

751
01:18:52,340 --> 01:18:56,090
challenges that they had reaching teachers and sharing the knowledge with their teachers.

752
01:18:57,440 --> 01:19:03,620
But so we did have that represented. We didn't have I mean, I think we didn't have like a license psychologist,

753
01:19:03,950 --> 01:19:09,380
but we had we license social workers and they had they were all pretty on the ball.

754
01:19:10,220 --> 01:19:13,549
Our school resource officers were not assigned. They volunteered.

755
01:19:13,550 --> 01:19:19,480
So these were people that were invested in working with students. They had gone through specific training, which is not true of all recent assaults.

756
01:19:20,130 --> 01:19:30,980
And um, just to comment on that, I had done some interviews in the summer for a trauma course that they're trying to develop.

757
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:37,309
And I was shocked, which surprised me. I was talking to a lot of students and getting their opinions,

758
01:19:37,310 --> 01:19:44,240
and a lot of the students told me that they don't trust their guidance counselors and they don't trust their social workers,

759
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:50,660
and they would rather go home and deal with something than to go talk to somebody, which is worse for them.

760
01:19:51,690 --> 01:19:56,399
Yeah. So what I mean, I can tell you, I mean, as a,

761
01:19:56,400 --> 01:20:00,990
as an evaluator and this isn't the only time that we've tried things that were theoretically motivated but didn't work.

762
01:20:01,530 --> 01:20:05,970
You know, that implementation, monitoring, that fidelity stuff that needs assessment,

763
01:20:06,390 --> 01:20:11,160
having all of that has helped us at least start to think through why this didn't work.

764
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:17,130
So if you are at a stage of your career where you're interested in testing a model on whether or not a program might be effective,

765
01:20:17,430 --> 01:20:26,250
I can't underscore enough why you should do some of the record grunt work of seeing how well this stuff actually gets implemented in practice.

766
01:20:26,550 --> 01:20:33,270
Could I really say that we implemented after the way it's supposed to work and that's all first aid trainings that we missed a couple of them.

767
01:20:33,420 --> 01:20:37,170
I mean, they seem like they were pretty bad, like pretty bad if you followed the guidelines.

768
01:20:37,380 --> 01:20:41,220
But they touch on all of the different components and not all.

769
01:20:41,220 --> 01:20:44,280
The first thing was that we didn't measure dosage received,

770
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:48,990
so we didn't have a chance to talk to the teachers after the training and say, Well, how much of this are you actually retaining?

771
01:20:49,290 --> 01:20:51,809
How easily do you think you could apply this in situations?

772
01:20:51,810 --> 01:20:58,320
It was only kind of after the fact, and we learned from some focus groups that, I get it, we understand why it's important.

773
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:04,740
But if a student comes to me with, you know, I've got a manifest, it is major depression.

774
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:08,640
I don't know what to do and I wouldn't know how to guide that student.

775
01:21:08,700 --> 01:21:16,379
So clearly the ID piece was there, but then the access to services there also is kind of implied within the offers.

776
01:21:16,380 --> 01:21:30,380
The training wasn't happening as well. Folks are supposed to be supposed to.

777
01:21:34,410 --> 01:21:42,230
I mean, I kind of get it, but I don't do it. Yeah. So my life, my work, our connection to justice.

778
01:21:42,490 --> 01:21:46,840
And I think you can show how you can you can do this with almost any of the areas of interest that you want to think about,

779
01:21:48,070 --> 01:21:53,650
schools or organizations just like any other. We're all part of organizations through our life, but we're also unique, right?

780
01:21:53,750 --> 01:21:55,360
I think there's something about schools.

781
01:21:55,360 --> 01:21:59,500
It's a little bit different, whether it's the population, whether it's the people that are in schools, I don't know.

782
01:21:59,770 --> 01:22:05,560
So you can't necessarily take things that we might learn from organizational theory or whatever and say, okay, well, this is also true of schools.

783
01:22:05,890 --> 01:22:11,410
And so try to think about those unique contexts. What makes schools different than other places where, for example, you know,

784
01:22:11,410 --> 01:22:15,250
crime prevention through environmental design started community service, that's a first name.

785
01:22:15,940 --> 01:22:22,570
I mean, I guess it's always kind of been applied to schools, but even restorative practices are also more broadly applied than just within schools.

786
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:29,710
And so is there any features about schools that could help us explain where things might be more successful?

787
01:22:31,030 --> 01:22:34,719
Upstream interventions. You folks are already referenced in a little bit, if I may.

788
01:22:34,720 --> 01:22:37,960
By the time you get into the like the lockdown drill training or the active shooter training,

789
01:22:38,680 --> 01:22:46,669
is this really where we need to be spending our time or is it really better to be focusing on some of those upstream interventions,

790
01:22:46,670 --> 01:22:47,950
those prevention activities,

791
01:22:48,160 --> 01:22:54,010
so that we never get to the point where we're going to be in a lockdown situation where it's one of the things that we can be doing there.

792
01:22:54,250 --> 01:22:58,540
And is that going to be more effective in these cases then making sure that all

793
01:22:58,930 --> 01:23:03,130
130,000 schools in this country go through at least three lockdown drills a year?

794
01:23:04,810 --> 01:23:09,370
That's an open question, by the way. It's still an open question. Should we be doing lockdown drills in any area?

795
01:23:09,370 --> 01:23:13,180
Are you in better or worse for the fact that you've gone through in your school, your school environment?

796
01:23:13,420 --> 01:23:15,219
I think it's good that, you know, the derivative probably,

797
01:23:15,220 --> 01:23:24,370
but I don't know if you whether or not having a lockdown drills was an important part of your educational moment challenges due to rarity.

798
01:23:24,940 --> 01:23:31,120
I think some folks kind of touched on this a little bit, but any time that you have something that doesn't happen very often,

799
01:23:31,300 --> 01:23:34,510
an injury is one of those fields where this could be it could be applicable,

800
01:23:34,510 --> 01:23:37,749
especially when we started to break down those different demographic groups.

801
01:23:37,750 --> 01:23:41,379
And how often do people who are riding bicycles that look this way and that

802
01:23:41,380 --> 01:23:44,830
are in this environment and whatever are getting injured or hurt or killed,

803
01:23:46,060 --> 01:23:51,610
that can be a big issue. And statistically, school shootings are very, very rare.

804
01:23:52,270 --> 01:23:57,069
And I'm not talking about even just mass shootings, but just school shootings in general and bringing a firearm to school,

805
01:23:57,070 --> 01:24:05,950
about 5% of two to 3 to 5% based on and the professors of students will report bringing a firearm to school over the course of a given year,

806
01:24:06,250 --> 01:24:12,940
and that's going to be overreporting or underreporting. And so it's hard to say, but it's been pretty consistent over the last ten, 15 years.

807
01:24:13,630 --> 01:24:18,730
But just because we implement an intervention and a school shooting doesn't happen or that we've been successful.

808
01:24:21,410 --> 01:24:26,570
Probably not. Right. Because school shootings just don't tend to happen.

809
01:24:27,180 --> 01:24:30,450
And how do we disentangle? It was never going to happen.

810
01:24:30,470 --> 01:24:37,040
The counterfactual versus we actually had some sort of preventive effect here.

811
01:24:37,850 --> 01:24:40,280
And that's not something easy to do in my field.

812
01:24:40,550 --> 01:24:44,270
I think it can be difficult in many of your fields as well, depending on where you feel you have to focus.

813
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:51,470
And then there was you were the one talking about about the interaction between time and space.

814
01:24:51,740 --> 01:24:56,330
I want to know and I was sorry to again about an article around the shooter from Parkland.

815
01:24:56,570 --> 01:25:01,490
And it talked about all the preceding events before that shooting happened and all the things that kind of

816
01:25:01,490 --> 01:25:06,440
went wrong and that person's life and around that person's life and the signs that were kind of missed.

817
01:25:06,710 --> 01:25:14,149
You see some terrible stories from from other case studies of school shootings where the signs were kind of there, but people missed them.

818
01:25:14,150 --> 01:25:17,390
It was in the writing. It was in what happened at home. It was with one friend.

819
01:25:18,020 --> 01:25:24,079
And for whatever reason, we weren't able to connect the dots until afterwards. But what are the things that are happening prior to the event?

820
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:28,840
At the time of the event, following the event, where we might be able to intervene and reduce that injury burden?

821
01:25:29,510 --> 01:25:35,810
One of the things that we don't talk about much with in our active shooter drills is that after a shooting might have happened.

822
01:25:36,140 --> 01:25:40,549
We don't want folks running out of the building. It seems like that's where we want to hindsight.

823
01:25:40,550 --> 01:25:46,670
Right. But if you have people who are injured in the building and you crowd the halls with people trying to leave the building,

824
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:50,030
that stops first responders from reacting as fast as they could.

825
01:25:50,390 --> 01:25:54,890
So how do we communicate that information to make sure folks are on the same page and that if you are leaving,

826
01:25:55,100 --> 01:26:01,370
then you also have to think about the exposure that somebody might have if they see one of their classmates or peers that's been injured.

827
01:26:01,820 --> 01:26:05,560
And how do we get those? So lots of interesting questions related.

828
01:26:05,570 --> 01:26:10,340
And boy, does that just kind of recognize this.

829
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:17,600
Yes. That's our hands majors. And this one Carolinian applied this way back in 1988.

830
01:26:18,680 --> 01:26:26,790
Took that took that that that idea of shootings that could happen within schools and started to break it down.

831
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:31,370
And I promise you, this is school shootings. We've seen this for motor vehicle crashes.

832
01:26:31,550 --> 01:26:35,510
I don't care what area of injury you want to do that. You can fill out a table like this.

833
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:39,530
Give it a shot. Yeah. All right. All right. That's it for me.

834
01:26:40,310 --> 01:26:45,110
I will say it. We're turning to you again. Know what is it that we want to be focusing our time?

835
01:26:45,110 --> 01:26:49,760
Where should we be directing our efforts? It costs money. It has it has personnel costs.

836
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,340
It could potentially affect students. We don't know how much.

837
01:26:52,550 --> 01:26:58,790
No one's really kind of talked to students in a lot of depth after afterwards to figure out, well, yes, I was still thinking about this.

838
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:08,170
However, much later, we have seen some anecdotes where it's been concerning, especially one that the girls were just really, really salient.

839
01:27:08,180 --> 01:27:12,080
But again, it happened 212 hours later.

840
01:27:12,650 --> 01:27:18,080
So maybe it could happen to others. I always want to recognize the many folks that make this work possible,

841
01:27:18,860 --> 01:27:22,130
and I appreciate everybody from just talking to me said and engaging in some of these I.

842
01:27:23,270 --> 01:27:29,720
If you want a space that's ripe for disruption where lots of things are happening, but we don't know how well they're working.

843
01:27:29,870 --> 01:27:36,920
School safety is the place for you. There is a lot of vested interest in school developing school safety interventions.

844
01:27:38,210 --> 01:27:44,990
Sometimes positively. Sometimes I worry about the direction that some of these big companies and corporations are going,

845
01:27:45,290 --> 01:27:49,160
you know, so that they have these prepackaged programs that all schools can do without all that evidence.

846
01:27:49,910 --> 01:27:55,250
So be very, very happy to talk to folks outside of class about this work that we're doing or get involved.

847
01:27:55,820 --> 01:28:00,080
But I do think it's an important space. And so that's it for of our presentation.

848
01:28:02,060 --> 01:28:05,320
Great time now. I'm going to give folks the option.

849
01:28:05,660 --> 01:28:07,850
We'll take a ten minute break if you want to come back.

850
01:28:07,860 --> 01:28:11,780
I'm going to run through some basics of research design, because it sounded like a couple weeks ago,

851
01:28:11,780 --> 01:28:15,290
folks maybe have only been exposed a little bit or if it's been a little while,

852
01:28:15,290 --> 01:28:20,779
I don't know if you've taken research about this or taken 622 or whatever, but don't feel like you have to attend.

853
01:28:20,780 --> 01:28:22,490
This is probably good for some folks.

854
01:28:23,180 --> 01:28:30,200
So but if you are less familiar with experimental designs, the idea of the kind of factual how we can diagram an intervention,

855
01:28:30,710 --> 01:28:35,269
that's kind of what I'm going to cover threats to internal validity, but it's up to policy recovery.

856
01:28:35,270 --> 01:28:42,660
So in years you want good yeah what is what other like I know Christopher schools this like like

857
01:28:42,770 --> 01:28:49,340
interesting like what other forms of Christian people do this work at the schools like say if you work.

858
01:28:50,300 --> 01:28:52,730
Um, I can't think of anything right now.

859
01:28:52,730 --> 01:29:04,129
I, it's just so yeah, there's a lot of like, I would imagine because like Amazon, like hires, like safety specialist or whatever your title is,

860
01:29:04,130 --> 01:29:12,320
whatever the title is, they people like want their employees to be safe because when people are down here, people are working those interesting areas.

861
01:29:12,500 --> 01:29:18,710
You mentioned Amazon. So in addition to like the occupational safety stuff, they actually address interpersonal violence as well.

862
01:29:18,710 --> 01:29:24,430
So they have threat assessment teams. The idea of if you identify someone who might be an injury to himself or others,

863
01:29:24,670 --> 01:29:33,640
you have a meeting with a pre-identified team that assesses the threat and then potentially develops a mitigation plan if there's if it's credible.

864
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:40,360
So if if a worker has been uttering statements or been very aggressive or they stop coming to work,

865
01:29:40,360 --> 01:29:44,650
all of a sudden give away like church ministry, little signs that people might be worried about someone.

866
01:29:45,430 --> 01:29:49,239
Amazon is one example of one of those organizations that has the University of

867
01:29:49,240 --> 01:29:54,010
Michigan actually and met with their hospital systems director of security.

868
01:29:54,250 --> 01:29:59,230
So hospitals are a place where there's often violence.

869
01:29:59,530 --> 01:30:05,590
Many times it's connected with an intimate partner. But people will bring weapons to a hospital and try to injure folks.

870
01:30:05,860 --> 01:30:12,850
So many schools are one space workplaces and other space, but hospitals are one more space where these things could potentially apply.

871
01:30:13,150 --> 01:30:17,280
And so then what do you do? How do you screen? You have metal detectors. Do you have passes?

872
01:30:17,290 --> 01:30:20,650
Do you have clear backpacks? Do you have no backpacks or do you have no bags?

873
01:30:21,160 --> 01:30:31,230
All questions that folks in security spaces that you. Go take it and it's gone.

874
01:30:37,910 --> 01:30:42,920
There's a lot of to do in this field.

875
01:30:43,820 --> 01:30:51,530
But you are going to have lots of questions about stuff like intervention critique.

876
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:58,370
Senator. Yeah, I really need her out to somebody else.

877
01:30:58,370 --> 01:31:02,030
And that is that one of the ones that I did or one that I know, you know, but I.

878
01:31:03,140 --> 01:31:06,640
Yeah. I just wanted to know so that, you know, I enjoyed it.

879
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:19,990
But my question in terms of like this idea in 1933, I like on a day when I feel a little lost,

880
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:27,710
which feels weird because I felt but like I know summarizing my figure on pieces from the article.

881
01:31:27,710 --> 01:31:34,630
So now I say to you and a lot of people have and he's a very you can't I mean if I know what you're talking about summarizing,

882
01:31:34,640 --> 01:31:40,130
you don't need to say what you're someone. Okay. And then is there an expectation that we're saying things?

883
01:31:40,430 --> 01:31:47,899
But I think a little bit, because I came here as I earlier, I feel you're applying some of these ideas.

884
01:31:47,900 --> 01:31:51,950
So I don't need you to tell me this is what a history threat is.

885
01:31:52,310 --> 01:31:52,900
Citation.

886
01:31:52,910 --> 01:32:01,980
It's more of I'm recognizing that this this is like this is this can be a very controlling for example because exactly this is a that's okay.

887
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:07,970
So it's it's really not going to be like heavy on sexuality environment.

888
01:32:08,360 --> 01:32:15,140
Okay. Because I put in the ones at the end of when I started the article, at the end of the things I was like, that is not no,

889
01:32:15,950 --> 01:32:23,450
I'm looking for you to poke holes in their design or the way that they're kind of choosing their measures or how they're drawing conclusions.

890
01:32:23,750 --> 01:32:30,740
That's the kind of level of engagement. So you don't really need to focus on your grades.

891
01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:34,119
Okay. Okay. That sounds good. Okay. Yeah.

892
01:32:34,120 --> 01:32:40,070
Yeah. And I will try and stop trying to turn those around the so that you'll have at least a couple of days if I had any tolerance for it.

893
01:32:40,760 --> 01:32:44,659
But great. Thank you. Right. I get it when it comes to grading.

894
01:32:44,660 --> 01:32:52,330
So any feedback? Where do you think that's progress?

895
01:32:52,340 --> 01:32:58,490
I was like I was like, I don't read they're boxes. But yeah, I guess this is the place.

896
01:32:58,670 --> 01:33:12,799
I feel like having an empty room, but I know people just don't care about research design for oh, I'm like, oh, I think the kids are those are good.

897
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:21,380
Our kids are good. What is not good is that it's the time of day and it's been like in, like, like, you know,

898
01:33:21,620 --> 01:33:31,270
I have decided that I wanted to I don't know I was I was a disability for past.

899
01:33:31,970 --> 01:33:34,200
It is like you can say for good reason.

900
01:33:34,220 --> 01:33:47,690
I'm just like, oh yeah, you definitely would be interested because word is that, you know, you have it's not like I went to see what it was.

901
01:33:47,720 --> 01:33:52,130
I said this before, it's not getting better, but I have heard that.

902
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:58,940
Yeah, first day there's, there's a title and then they were like, well that's interesting.

903
01:33:58,940 --> 01:34:02,749
I'd love to invite like I any suggestions from me on how to handle it.

904
01:34:02,750 --> 01:34:11,740
That's how I found this out. My word. I didn't let people know that they're going to like like, you know,

905
01:34:11,890 --> 01:34:25,940
like I'm doing no know I think yeah kids are just like I know one of my father Anthony that was really funny because like I said,

906
01:34:25,940 --> 01:34:29,180
I was already supposed to be there and they're like, I don't like you.

907
01:34:29,710 --> 01:34:34,070
Oh, oh, man. I love that you've been out of the classroom for a long time.

908
01:34:34,420 --> 01:34:38,660
Positive reinforcement, like, oh, okay. Not being embarrassed.

909
01:34:39,620 --> 01:34:42,950
I don't like you. Okay, well, that's not, you know. How are you?

910
01:34:43,250 --> 01:34:49,450
All right. I just want you to say. Yeah, well, I was working this weekend.

911
01:34:49,550 --> 01:34:54,710
Yeah, I get get the same advice, so it's really nice actually.

912
01:34:54,710 --> 01:34:58,460
Do. Yeah. You get to kind of think about that.

913
01:34:59,510 --> 01:35:03,590
All right, guys. Well, we have it. No, she didn't. Giving us both.

914
01:35:04,280 --> 01:35:09,670
Oh, that's nice. I didn't know there's going to be a debate tonight.

915
01:35:11,030 --> 01:35:14,419
Yeah, I think they're holding hands. November or something.

916
01:35:14,420 --> 01:35:23,690
Early April for where they're going to graduate.

917
01:35:23,730 --> 01:35:26,840
The Harvard native Texan is oh, Jackson.

918
01:35:26,840 --> 01:35:32,130
They're the two main Texas political candidates.

919
01:35:32,330 --> 01:35:39,150
It's about look who's running for governor. Wasting time with murder is for me, safer.

920
01:35:42,620 --> 01:35:45,680
It's been four years now.

921
01:35:46,030 --> 01:35:53,120
Them all covered? Yeah. Like she wants me to go out tonight.

922
01:35:53,820 --> 01:35:58,920
Yeah. Yeah. I don't even have time to go through her life.

923
01:35:58,970 --> 01:36:09,800
Runs in the family. Yeah. That's real trauma to tell you about the drama of trying to be killed, the people that are doing there work, any performers.

924
01:36:10,040 --> 01:36:13,490
So are they ready for some of it?

925
01:36:15,900 --> 01:36:22,160
Not good for a literate. I don't know. I think one of them was I feel like I felt like one of them was finished.

926
01:36:23,240 --> 01:36:30,690
I think majority of them were from where do you just look it up? I mean, it would make sense to my reading.

927
01:36:30,740 --> 01:36:34,220
It's not all you got. I'd like to been.

928
01:36:34,670 --> 01:36:43,220
Yeah, but I don't really hate to listen to them planning to kidnap one of the founders or her mother?

929
01:36:43,370 --> 01:36:50,800
I don't think I would want the notion that would make them like Americans.

930
01:36:51,770 --> 01:36:55,129
That's right. So that's right. Strings. I know.

931
01:36:55,130 --> 01:37:02,280
So like I love this story and you know, you didn't have a lot.

932
01:37:02,460 --> 01:37:06,550
The first one that I know.

933
01:37:07,190 --> 01:37:17,299
Oh, I am so intrigued by this. I just know that's a book I wouldn't make if this is good.

934
01:37:17,300 --> 01:37:31,740
I like that. And then after three courses really doing it, I love to read.

935
01:37:35,630 --> 01:37:53,750
Yeah, it does seem at least a month away, but it was rather like I said, it was like, you know,

936
01:37:53,760 --> 01:38:00,680
if I didn't have 35, then people would turn to when I don't want to call them or Google Research.

937
01:38:01,700 --> 01:38:08,030
Oh, she's a I've known her from Michigan and the rest of them from Wisconsin and Wisconsin.

938
01:38:09,080 --> 01:38:12,170
What? Pirate suspects.

939
01:38:12,440 --> 01:38:17,130
Now we are bringing them back. Could you say.

940
01:38:22,340 --> 01:38:28,180
I Maria wanted to act like a fighter, and players was a lot closer.

941
01:38:29,210 --> 01:38:32,940
Now I know about the girls. Like, oh, I just.

942
01:38:33,290 --> 01:38:39,620
I was like, no, I haven't finished. I don't know how to criticize the size of the intervention.

943
01:38:39,650 --> 01:38:49,250
Like I'm trying to figure out. I decided I want to be like I can't help but yeah.

944
01:38:50,540 --> 01:38:58,399
Were like, but I honestly feel like the guy is like it's what I really learned how I would want

945
01:38:58,400 --> 01:39:04,100
my brother to or doesn't want to be more discerning just because I was everything I,

946
01:39:04,250 --> 01:39:08,920
I was like, also, I want to know how do you feel? Like I do.

947
01:39:08,920 --> 01:39:12,979
I think that is like provides a belief among others.

948
01:39:12,980 --> 01:39:16,990
I know our own 13 year exam and a couple of weeks is coming.

949
01:39:17,010 --> 01:39:29,569
Your doctor is so good. I get to learn how he's going to finally find out that we are on the concussion.

950
01:39:29,570 --> 01:39:45,260
However, this is a trainer. So it so really like, oh, no, I had I was out like, like they used to know I could grow in a cross section.

951
01:39:45,310 --> 01:39:48,650
Yeah, I know. I feel that. I don't know what to do about it.

952
01:39:49,070 --> 01:39:55,070
Yeah. Yeah. Tell you about that. He tells her and all of a sudden I'm like, you're lying.

953
01:39:56,390 --> 01:40:00,020
And like, how long you don't know?

954
01:40:00,170 --> 01:40:04,070
My body is literally your brain. Yeah. You get a job on the ground.

955
01:40:04,430 --> 01:40:07,750
That's why it's all just. I did it because I did.

956
01:40:07,910 --> 01:40:11,390
Yeah, and that's normal. Yeah, that's great.

957
01:40:11,470 --> 01:40:16,460
Look, I remember hearing a lot of, like, what, a little thing last year,

958
01:40:17,900 --> 01:40:26,040
but there has been progress, I think just playing for other, you know, things different.

959
01:40:26,060 --> 01:40:35,400
I me, I've been to both games. I don't know, I, I learned that in that one year and right now it's hard, but it's growing.

960
01:40:35,780 --> 01:40:47,450
I feel like watching it, it's kind of like, you know, I love football for just like no matter what I do.

961
01:40:50,300 --> 01:41:03,570
And and I guess I don't ever want to be, like, watching surgery without doing all right for you.

962
01:41:03,590 --> 01:41:07,520
Might be right. Yeah. Hello. We'll see if we never do this crash course.

963
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:16,220
Catch him early. So basically this is going to be is in response to our sorry critique assignment, which is due in about a week.

964
01:41:18,740 --> 01:41:22,580
This is not a I don't mean this to be prescriptive as in if I talk about it here,

965
01:41:22,580 --> 01:41:28,580
I want to see within your critique, but I do think it could help make it stronger. I know that several folks in the room have already sent me a draft.

966
01:41:28,580 --> 01:41:31,700
You're welcome to do that. If you do that by today, that'll be great.

967
01:41:31,700 --> 01:41:38,690
I'll try to get to it back to you over the weekend. So you have a couple of days to to to make any sort of revisions.

968
01:41:39,470 --> 01:41:44,150
But here is some basic ideas from research. And if I if if I know some of these, please shut up.

969
01:41:44,190 --> 01:41:46,640
This I've been talking a lot today. It would be great to hear from you, too.

970
01:41:47,540 --> 01:41:57,110
But talking through just from the from the get go, do we see, for example, some of the stuff within her article?

971
01:41:57,530 --> 01:41:59,420
Do they clearly define a research question?

972
01:42:00,170 --> 01:42:05,870
And if they've define a research question, then you can start to map that research question on to some of the activities.

973
01:42:06,560 --> 01:42:12,020
I think because we're talking about interventions, do they make any sort of comment about the implementation of that intervention?

974
01:42:12,470 --> 01:42:21,380
Right. Have they do they talk about how the program was supposed to go or do they talk about whether people how they experience the program?

975
01:42:21,710 --> 01:42:26,990
Right. These are just some some initial things that you want to look for.

976
01:42:27,740 --> 01:42:30,979
One of the parts that we're talking about is how you're going to measure that impact.

977
01:42:30,980 --> 01:42:34,340
That's part of the the measurement part of this assignment.

978
01:42:34,730 --> 01:42:42,760
How are they defining their outcomes? Do you support or do you think is reasonable that they define the outcomes in the way that they have?

979
01:42:43,220 --> 01:42:48,290
Do you can you suggest alternatives and you suggest problems that might be related to some of those outcomes?

980
01:42:48,950 --> 01:42:50,930
Again, I'm not saying that you have to do all these things,

981
01:42:51,200 --> 01:42:57,500
but these are just some of the things that I might be thinking about as I look through an article, the design.

982
01:42:57,980 --> 01:43:00,110
So here you have a question that you're going to answer.

983
01:43:00,110 --> 01:43:05,030
And then also this is always kind of relating back to that question of interest, like what is your research or evaluation question?

984
01:43:05,690 --> 01:43:11,300
Does the design that they've chosen, is that is that appropriate for answering the question that they have?

985
01:43:12,140 --> 01:43:14,510
And if you're trying to assess change, for example,

986
01:43:15,170 --> 01:43:19,730
is this a cross-sectional design where they're really not going to be able to assess that change, is it?

987
01:43:19,970 --> 01:43:30,000
What's the who is participating? This design, does the measurements inappropriate for repeated measures if it's going to be that?

988
01:43:30,670 --> 01:43:35,820
So digging through some of the features of the design and whether or not it's going to be applicable here.

989
01:43:36,890 --> 01:43:40,740
The rigor of the design, is this just a pre-post test sample?

990
01:43:41,070 --> 01:43:44,940
Is this a give? Is there a control group? Was there any form of randomization?

991
01:43:44,940 --> 01:43:48,360
If those are unfamiliar to you, we'll talk about it in just a second. But really,

992
01:43:48,360 --> 01:43:53,009
what this kind of comes down to is we're trying to establish a link between the

993
01:43:53,010 --> 01:43:57,720
intervention and its outcome and what's the internal validity of our given study.

994
01:43:58,140 --> 01:44:05,520
How does how can we tie in these sort of changes that we observe in the outcome variable to the intervention and not to something else?

995
01:44:05,910 --> 01:44:12,660
And this is applicable not just in this assignment, but in almost everything that we do, because we as interventionists in public health,

996
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:17,759
we want to be able to say it was our lockdown drills that were made that made

997
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:22,170
students feel safe and more prepared to deal with an event if it happens.

998
01:44:27,970 --> 01:44:31,510
Oops. Sorry if you've never heard the term counterfactual.

999
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:39,040
I think it's a good one to know. Usually when most of our research design, we are trying to establish an accurate counterfactual,

1000
01:44:39,490 --> 01:44:45,070
which means if we take Mohammed and we expose him to an intervention, how does he change?

1001
01:44:45,430 --> 01:44:51,760
Now we're going to go back in time, take Mohammed not exposed to the intervention, and look to see how he changes or doesn't change.

1002
01:44:52,060 --> 01:44:59,770
And at the end of the day, we're going to compare that change from being exposed to the design or the intervention versus not.

1003
01:45:00,250 --> 01:45:08,560
Now, that's not possible. So really what most research design is all about is trying to create the best counterfactual that we can.

1004
01:45:09,280 --> 01:45:14,500
And so that's one question and I'm asking myself what is our counterfactual within some of these studies?

1005
01:45:14,800 --> 01:45:22,360
Who are we comparing our treatment, our exposure group to, to determine whether or not the change that we observe is because,

1006
01:45:22,360 --> 01:45:26,110
again, their exposure to the intervention versus something else.

1007
01:45:26,750 --> 01:45:31,210
Right. And we kind of measure what folks have familiarity with.

1008
01:45:32,260 --> 01:45:40,180
But oftentimes that's through the establishment of a control group or we're using someone's previous measurements as a control.

1009
01:45:40,180 --> 01:45:47,010
So this is how they were before the study or after. Let's look at some of that change and the decisions that you make about how to collect

1010
01:45:47,050 --> 01:45:50,710
data or how to define that control group or what that counterfactual is going to be.

1011
01:45:51,750 --> 01:45:56,260
It can go a long way in terms of ruling out some of those alternative explanations

1012
01:45:56,500 --> 01:46:05,440
that it was something other than your program that's driving that change. And it's just not a definition of the counterfactual.

1013
01:46:05,920 --> 01:46:11,350
But we do have this exposed group to the program relative to one that was not exposed to the program.

1014
01:46:12,100 --> 01:46:19,630
So we're going to find ourselves some way to construct a comparison group that's going to allow us to say, you know,

1015
01:46:19,870 --> 01:46:22,330
had we not done anything with the same way with a set of folks,

1016
01:46:23,320 --> 01:46:28,240
this is how we would have expected them to change or not change, but because they were exposed to intervention.

1017
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:39,180
This is why we feel like they're different. Which questions about this idea in principle for years.

1018
01:46:39,200 --> 01:46:49,040
Yeah. Don't explain the causal link between the intervention and what is really the alternative explanations for socialization.

1019
01:46:49,460 --> 01:46:55,189
Right. So it's hard to say without a good counterfactual that if we observe a change

1020
01:46:55,190 --> 01:46:58,850
in somebody following their exposure to whatever interventions that it was,

1021
01:46:58,910 --> 01:47:03,410
specifically because of that exposure that they change in the way they did.

1022
01:47:03,860 --> 01:47:11,300
An alternative explanation would be any other reason that we can we can think of to explain why that person responded that the way they did.

1023
01:47:11,660 --> 01:47:14,210
So you're telling me it's because of their exposure to your program?

1024
01:47:14,480 --> 01:47:18,920
I might say it's because they were exposed to something else or the way that you presented the

1025
01:47:18,920 --> 01:47:23,480
program wasn't consistent with what you thought was going to make the change or something.

1026
01:47:25,280 --> 01:47:33,439
I don't know. Or the the the way that you measured their change was inappropriate or it worked for some groups,

1027
01:47:33,440 --> 01:47:36,050
but not all of the groups in your that were exposed to the intervention.

1028
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:42,230
So you're trying to figure out different ways to to explain what changes that you observe.

1029
01:47:42,980 --> 01:47:46,910
And so the way, again, to rule that out is if we can get two groups of people.

1030
01:47:47,240 --> 01:47:51,710
And the only thing that differs about those two groups of people is that one group got exposed to intervention.

1031
01:47:52,010 --> 01:47:58,850
That is essentially our strongest way of saying that any changes that are differences that we see must be because of that intervention.

1032
01:47:59,150 --> 01:48:03,890
That's kind of the logic behind some of the experimental design stuff to do that as your question.

1033
01:48:05,510 --> 01:48:10,280
Yeah. When you don't have a control group or compared to you on this, I would say.

1034
01:48:11,080 --> 01:48:16,520
You can't. Just turn it now for sure.

1035
01:48:17,090 --> 01:48:24,260
I think of internal validity or causality as a continuum from very, very weak up to very, very strong.

1036
01:48:25,130 --> 01:48:31,310
And the reason why is because even some of your weakest, you know, quote unquote, experimental designs, we don't have anything free.

1037
01:48:31,580 --> 01:48:33,770
We just do the program and then we talk to people about it.

1038
01:48:34,040 --> 01:48:38,839
There's still probably a little something that we can learn there and kind of inform that it was because of

1039
01:48:38,840 --> 01:48:44,540
the intervention that they've changed their attitudes or behaviors or whatever relative to the very far end,

1040
01:48:44,540 --> 01:48:51,680
like the randomized controlled trial where, you know, your design is controlling for most of those alternative explanations,

1041
01:48:52,400 --> 01:48:57,380
that's going to be at the highest level of the continuum. So it's not really valid, invalid.

1042
01:48:57,650 --> 01:49:04,170
It's more of what's what's the strength of the evidence. Few questions or other questions.

1043
01:49:07,890 --> 01:49:14,050
Right? Yes. Real crash course. They're pretty experimental designs.

1044
01:49:14,140 --> 01:49:19,270
Essentially, they have just the idea that you don't have a comparison group.

1045
01:49:19,960 --> 01:49:25,150
Like if you just mentioned, this would be a situation where you have, you know,

1046
01:49:25,720 --> 01:49:31,650
an intervention and then you talk to people afterwards or you talk to some folks who human intervention, you talk to them afterwards.

1047
01:49:32,440 --> 01:49:40,360
It's hard to say whether it's not whether it's the intervention that is resulting in those changes or it's just the fact that you happen to

1048
01:49:40,360 --> 01:49:48,010
get a group of people that were more or less likely to respond in the way that you that they did that could be driving some of those changes.

1049
01:49:48,310 --> 01:49:52,750
So we don't really have a strong counterfactual in pre experimental designs.

1050
01:49:53,680 --> 01:49:59,649
The reason why I bring in this kind of science and evaluation thing is because often time for evaluation budgets are not big,

1051
01:49:59,650 --> 01:50:04,660
gigantic R1 type budgets. And what we might be stuck with is an experimental design.

1052
01:50:05,200 --> 01:50:09,009
We have one chance to talk to folks after our intervention, or if we're really lucky.

1053
01:50:09,010 --> 01:50:12,370
We have a pretest in a post test. We don't have the money for a control.

1054
01:50:13,030 --> 01:50:17,979
Now, from a design perspective, that's weaker. But my argument is still that there's probably something to learn.

1055
01:50:17,980 --> 01:50:25,420
So even in these articles where there might be weaker designs, is there still something that makes you think, okay, even though this isn't an RCD,

1056
01:50:25,720 --> 01:50:28,690
I can still trust this result because of this reason, that reason or another,

1057
01:50:30,910 --> 01:50:35,680
the next kind of, you know, category of designs or quasi experimental designs.

1058
01:50:36,160 --> 01:50:40,300
Here you do have some form of control group or counterfactual, right?

1059
01:50:40,570 --> 01:50:44,620
You are either bringing in what we call a non equivalent control group.

1060
01:50:44,860 --> 01:50:48,160
So we have two groups of people, one that get exposed to an intervention, one who doesn't,

1061
01:50:48,580 --> 01:50:57,729
but those two groups who are probably not the same either because of the way that we sampled or just just the fact that we

1062
01:50:57,730 --> 01:51:04,330
didn't have the opportunity to be able to actually randomize folks and rule out some of those unmeasurable differences.

1063
01:51:06,220 --> 01:51:15,100
Contrast that to an experimental design that the standard feature, which is kind of a randomization into one of your groups.

1064
01:51:15,550 --> 01:51:20,440
And the reason why this is so important is if you have two groups, one that's going to be exposed to an intervention,

1065
01:51:20,650 --> 01:51:28,300
one that's not if those two groups don't look the exact same when we start, then we give one the intervention, the other doesn't get it.

1066
01:51:28,480 --> 01:51:36,460
We look at those outcomes. We can't say that the differences that we observe in those in that post test are different because of the intervention.

1067
01:51:36,670 --> 01:51:39,340
If they were never the same to begin with. Right.

1068
01:51:39,340 --> 01:51:46,630
We have it rules out that logic that the only thing that was different about their two experiences was one group got exposed to the program.

1069
01:51:47,140 --> 01:51:50,200
Now statistically we can try to control for where people started.

1070
01:51:50,200 --> 01:51:55,120
And so there are ways around to make a non like a quasi experimental design a little bit stronger.

1071
01:51:55,960 --> 01:52:05,109
But the hallmark of the RC t is that we have our two groups or however many groups we want to have we randomly assign individuals to.

1072
01:52:05,110 --> 01:52:09,490
We take our sampling frame, which are going to be all the people who are eligible to participate in our study.

1073
01:52:09,880 --> 01:52:17,080
We take our sampling frame and we randomly assign them to one of those two conditions based on that random chance of being a group versus a group.

1074
01:52:17,080 --> 01:52:23,710
B The logic is that some of the variability among us is going to naturally start to evened out.

1075
01:52:24,100 --> 01:52:29,530
So we might sample on some very specific variables like your sex or demographics or something like that.

1076
01:52:29,830 --> 01:52:37,000
But if we're to allow in true randomization or just by chance going to get people that are that have a similar age

1077
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:43,240
distribution and a similar socioeconomic distribution and a similar socioeconomic or demographic distribution.

1078
01:52:43,600 --> 01:52:50,200
Right. That's what randomization can do. If it's done well, then even better, we have some of those things that we think about.

1079
01:52:50,440 --> 01:52:54,940
But there could also be a whole bunch of stuff that we really can't think about the way they feel about things,

1080
01:52:54,940 --> 01:52:57,670
their behaviors that we wouldn't necessarily measure.

1081
01:52:58,240 --> 01:53:04,480
But with that randomization process, we're going to more naturally get the people who are risk averse in both groups,

1082
01:53:04,720 --> 01:53:10,360
and we're going to more naturally give the people who love the brew a great boost baking show in both groups.

1083
01:53:10,630 --> 01:53:12,580
Right? Those little things,

1084
01:53:12,580 --> 01:53:19,390
intangible differences that we can't necessarily measure but could could have an influence on how people respond to the outcome variables.

1085
01:53:19,780 --> 01:53:26,139
That's what we're trying to rule out or that's what we're trying to do with our experimental design questions about these.

1086
01:53:26,140 --> 01:53:31,240
These are very broad categories and we can stretch them and show you how I kind of diagram some of these.

1087
01:53:31,870 --> 01:53:38,920
But if you kind of get the sense that from a continuum, I should think about the next slide from a continuum.

1088
01:53:43,120 --> 01:53:50,260
We go from the lowest levels of internal validity with our experimental designs moving up to the highest level of internal,

1089
01:53:50,800 --> 01:53:54,700
internal validity with our experimental designs. Observational studies,

1090
01:53:54,700 --> 01:54:02,350
like we often see where we're not actively assigning people to intervention groups are more likely going to fall into one of these spaces.

1091
01:54:03,100 --> 01:54:09,160
But a lot of the work that we end up doing in injury science tends to fall into either pretty experimental or quite an experimental designs.

1092
01:54:09,430 --> 01:54:13,780
The there doesn't have a control group at all. Or if we have one, it's an imperfect one.

1093
01:54:13,780 --> 01:54:24,550
Maybe it's like a convenience sample or something, and we have to make our best inferences based on the limitations in that data as this like.

1094
01:54:27,660 --> 01:54:33,870
If you've heard me say the word internal validity or the phrase, this is just one more time, kind of a more formal definition.

1095
01:54:34,680 --> 01:54:39,090
All we're really trying to do here, we have an intervention. We think it's driving the change.

1096
01:54:39,300 --> 01:54:46,170
We're going to try to do everything that we can to convince you that the change that we observe is because of the intervention,

1097
01:54:46,380 --> 01:54:49,830
our data, our post-test data, whether there was even a pretest.

1098
01:54:49,830 --> 01:54:53,340
But the data that we're seeing is just from which we're drawing our conclusions.

1099
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:57,030
It looks this way because you were exposed to intervention.

1100
01:54:57,630 --> 01:55:03,060
That's what all this internal validity stuff is all about. Questions so far.

1101
01:55:07,490 --> 01:55:11,770
So the information that I was looking at was six years old.

1102
01:55:11,990 --> 01:55:18,229
Mm hmm. But what was the benefit of randomizing the participants for the survey?

1103
01:55:18,230 --> 01:55:23,270
But they didn't compare. So the contrast is what they responded in Target.

1104
01:55:24,290 --> 01:55:28,790
Well, so what are the benefits of randomization? You're for bias.

1105
01:55:29,610 --> 01:55:35,550
Yeah. So by me and by. By creating groups that are more or less equivalent, you should be able to eliminate bias.

1106
01:55:36,900 --> 01:55:43,200
But if you're finding that, then they didn't utilize those comparisons appropriately or the way that they could have,

1107
01:55:43,590 --> 01:55:46,800
that would be a weakness or a limitation in the way that they've approached the state.

1108
01:55:53,190 --> 01:56:00,780
So how do we make kind of our choice? This is as much to this assignment as it is to our daily practice.

1109
01:56:01,980 --> 01:56:05,760
I didn't give you perfect paper articles to review.

1110
01:56:06,090 --> 01:56:07,650
There's going to be some errors here.

1111
01:56:08,070 --> 01:56:17,580
But I also want folks to be able to at least consider what's kind of feasible when a decision to have a control group is made or not made.

1112
01:56:18,180 --> 01:56:25,290
Can you put yourself in their position and think, or do they explain why a control group might not have been possible if they did?

1113
01:56:25,290 --> 01:56:30,420
If they had a control group, but they didn't randomize why randomization would be very difficult.

1114
01:56:30,810 --> 01:56:34,890
Was it because of the cost? Was it because of the ethics? Was it because of whatever reason?

1115
01:56:35,280 --> 01:56:39,830
Can you think a step beyond just this is a pretty experimental design.

1116
01:56:39,840 --> 01:56:43,840
I know that those are they have the lowest internal validity. This article doesn't have anything to teach.

1117
01:56:44,460 --> 01:56:47,010
Right. Can you also kind of put yourself in those shoes?

1118
01:56:47,250 --> 01:56:51,629
I think the reason being is because at some point many of us are going to be in this position and we

1119
01:56:51,630 --> 01:56:56,310
still want to be able to make a case for why the data that we're collecting has some sort of value.

1120
01:56:56,760 --> 01:57:03,930
That data that I showed you with from the active shooter drills, that was a one time online survey of 1220 students and parents.

1121
01:57:04,270 --> 01:57:07,290
Right. There is no real kind of intervention there.

1122
01:57:07,650 --> 01:57:16,560
There's no there's no internal validity checks in terms of how their actual experiences with active shooter drills could be creating fear and stress.

1123
01:57:16,950 --> 01:57:22,200
Right. But it's still data. I still think it has some utility and I'm trying to make the case for it.

1124
01:57:22,500 --> 01:57:27,840
So getting that same kind of lens as you're looking at these articles is helpful.

1125
01:57:28,170 --> 01:57:30,840
Do they give you a little bit of background about where this program is,

1126
01:57:31,200 --> 01:57:35,759
if this program is brand new and they're trying to identify some of the initial effects, remember Dr. Bonner,

1127
01:57:35,760 --> 01:57:37,559
Erin, when she was talking about this,

1128
01:57:37,560 --> 01:57:46,380
more of a feasibility trial rather than the asked why that's a legitimate and valid first step if the program really hasn't established itself.

1129
01:57:46,680 --> 01:57:51,030
So even though, again, we might not think that this study that Aaron's running is the best way that she could,

1130
01:57:51,660 --> 01:57:58,559
it might make sense given the stage of the program, practicality and feasibility kind of self-explanatory.

1131
01:57:58,560 --> 01:58:02,550
But if it's going to be a large program, if there's not a lot of resources, if it's going to be difficult,

1132
01:58:02,850 --> 01:58:07,230
you know, it's easy to say, yeah, we're going to bring everybody in and survey them. It's actually kind of hard to do in practice.

1133
01:58:09,900 --> 01:58:12,590
What's the utility of the data kind of based on your understanding?

1134
01:58:12,870 --> 01:58:18,660
Do you feel like it was collected in a way that's going to have some value, including the types of measurements that they did?

1135
01:58:19,110 --> 01:58:20,639
I think I think this is a big one.

1136
01:58:20,640 --> 01:58:26,910
So if they're saying this program is effective in preventing injury and they didn't want to randomize kids into an injury group or a non-injury group,

1137
01:58:27,690 --> 01:58:31,350
that might be a good reason for why you don't see and asked. Right.

1138
01:58:31,470 --> 01:58:34,620
And so can we think through and consider the results in that context.

1139
01:58:39,150 --> 01:58:44,309
These could be helpful for folks as you're starting to think through the design that

1140
01:58:44,310 --> 01:58:48,480
they use and whether or not any of these potential threats to internal validity.

1141
01:58:48,480 --> 01:58:56,100
These are just some standard ones. It doesn't mean that they apply to every single article from showing hands.

1142
01:58:56,100 --> 01:58:59,400
How many folks have seen some of these before? Well, yeah.

1143
01:58:59,640 --> 01:59:02,910
All right. Tell me about that. What's the history threat?

1144
01:59:04,590 --> 01:59:11,770
External threats to the intervention that really affected your pretest.

1145
01:59:11,850 --> 01:59:16,110
You had a process. You have intervention in the middle. All of a sudden, something else is going on.

1146
01:59:16,140 --> 01:59:23,610
Can you give me an example? What's what would I like to use in the news out of you?

1147
01:59:24,560 --> 01:59:32,040
I have one where, like, there's other knowledge gained outside of intervention.

1148
01:59:32,340 --> 01:59:37,169
Yeah, well, an example go off and see uses like there's a public service announcement about or

1149
01:59:37,170 --> 01:59:40,890
maybe it's a program around breast cancer screening or colon cancer screening.

1150
01:59:41,130 --> 01:59:46,830
And then you have somebody like a famous person that publicly says that they have breast cancer or colon cancer or something.

1151
01:59:47,130 --> 01:59:49,440
And so all of a sudden, all these people want to increase their screens.

1152
01:59:50,100 --> 01:59:54,870
Is that because of your program or is it because people on Twitter and now they're kind of aware of the problem?

1153
01:59:55,080 --> 02:00:01,920
So it's something that's happening outside of the intervention is an alternative explanation for why you might have seen a change or a,

1154
02:00:01,920 --> 02:00:05,910
you know, an uptick in the number of screenings from your from your in your data.

1155
02:00:05,940 --> 02:00:09,000
How about second edition? Who's going this is fun now.

1156
02:00:09,510 --> 02:00:13,440
It's not me. It's like change.

1157
02:00:13,540 --> 02:00:19,900
So it's not like science. Hands up. Or is it? No.

1158
02:00:21,800 --> 02:00:25,990
No. So you can imagine if, um.

1159
02:00:27,210 --> 02:00:36,460
Uh. Let's see here. What's a good example right now? If I gave you a program that was focused on reducing alcohol consumption among adolescents,

1160
02:00:36,730 --> 02:00:43,540
and you found that from 2020 to 2023, there was a reduction in alcohol use as my program effective?

1161
02:00:45,550 --> 02:00:48,610
Oh, it could be, but yes.

1162
02:00:48,610 --> 02:00:53,950
So a secular trend talks about what was the to what was the data looking like before the intervention happened.

1163
02:00:54,280 --> 02:00:59,800
So alcohol use as a buffer for adolescents has actually been going down for about seven years now.

1164
02:01:00,070 --> 02:01:07,389
So if you plotted, you know, 2017 all the way to 2023, you would see that there was this kind of continuation of question.

1165
02:01:07,390 --> 02:01:12,070
I get a lot I ask a lot about my healthy minds data. Is this depression going up because of COVID?

1166
02:01:12,430 --> 02:01:18,070
And we say, yes, depression had a had a big increase during 2020 to 2022.

1167
02:01:18,430 --> 02:01:25,180
But if you look at 2015 to 20, 2022, excuse me, that line is pretty constant.

1168
02:01:25,180 --> 02:01:28,059
It's linear. So my answer is no.

1169
02:01:28,060 --> 02:01:35,170
COVID did not have a result in a huge spike in depressive symptoms based on like the, you know, the measures that we use.

1170
02:01:35,740 --> 02:01:38,590
This is more of a continuation from what we were already seeing.

1171
02:01:39,220 --> 02:01:49,780
It's an alternative explanation for the big the you know, the five or 10% change in depressive symptoms from 2020 to 2022.

1172
02:01:52,060 --> 02:01:55,840
Not testing or maturation,

1173
02:01:57,130 --> 02:02:05,050
but research essentially just if you're working with a population over a certain span of time and change them because they're aging.

1174
02:02:05,460 --> 02:02:08,350
Right. Right. Right.

1175
02:02:08,680 --> 02:02:15,370
And so I'm an insurance person here that if you if there's just kind of a natural development and I describe why people are changing,

1176
02:02:15,370 --> 02:02:16,449
I'll go back to the alcohol use.

1177
02:02:16,450 --> 02:02:24,490
If you did a five year study that went from 20 year from age 18 to 24, and you saw a big spike in people's alcohol consumption after about two years.

1178
02:02:24,850 --> 02:02:29,740
Why is that? Well, because they turn 21 or whatever, and now they can they can drink alcohol.

1179
02:02:30,010 --> 02:02:34,239
That could explain why. But you can also think about, you know, on the other side of things,

1180
02:02:34,240 --> 02:02:40,149
if your body is declining and you see an increase in falls, it could be not that your intervention is ineffective.

1181
02:02:40,150 --> 02:02:44,860
It's because you're reaching a stage in your life where falls are happening more frequently.

1182
02:02:45,080 --> 02:02:48,760
Right. So there been this natural uptick. We're kind of running out of time.

1183
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:55,540
What I want you to think through, though, it doesn't mean that you have to apply every single one of these terms to your article,

1184
02:02:55,750 --> 02:02:57,520
but can you think through a little bit of nuance?

1185
02:02:57,790 --> 02:03:05,200
If you're going to tell me that this is a maturation story, there should be enough time between data collections where maturation is happening.

1186
02:03:05,560 --> 02:03:11,440
If I gave you an intervention like a pretest, an intervention, and of course, there's a half an hour later that's not maturation.

1187
02:03:11,890 --> 02:03:19,630
Right? So taking a little bit beyond just, okay, I got the definition and I think I shared a sheet that has all these definitions along with them.

1188
02:03:20,260 --> 02:03:22,419
But I'm happy to talk through this stuff with anybody.

1189
02:03:22,420 --> 02:03:28,780
If you've not seen testing drugs or selection drugs, these are both kind of related to how we're measuring data pre and post test.

1190
02:03:29,210 --> 02:03:31,929
Last one I want to do so again.

1191
02:03:31,930 --> 02:03:37,329
This could be helpful for you if you wanted to just kind of break down your article based on some of these different threads.

1192
02:03:37,330 --> 02:03:42,520
Can you identify any of these that we talked about? Selection just means that people that were involved in the study.

1193
02:03:42,830 --> 02:03:45,610
Is there something about people having differential experiences?

1194
02:03:45,970 --> 02:03:51,080
Did some people in the study get exposed to the external threat versus others that did not?

1195
02:03:51,100 --> 02:03:57,550
That's kind of a differential history. The last piece that could be helpful for folks is I love diagrams.

1196
02:03:57,850 --> 02:04:06,130
I love thinking through how I can take the study that I think about when data was collected, observations, and when the intervention happened.

1197
02:04:06,400 --> 02:04:12,730
This is a very simple diagram, but what it helps me to do is think through some of those threads and some of those designs.

1198
02:04:13,120 --> 02:04:19,120
So based on a design like this, we had one observation an intervention and a second observation.

1199
02:04:19,630 --> 02:04:23,820
There's no control group here. There is a pretest in a post-test.

1200
02:04:24,250 --> 02:04:28,870
So where those threats to internal validity could apply to a design like this.

1201
02:04:29,620 --> 02:04:33,880
History could probably happen here, but we're going to change the way that people respond to it.

1202
02:04:34,150 --> 02:04:41,770
Maturation could probably happen in testing in any kind of exposure if you learn from your first your first administration.

1203
02:04:42,010 --> 02:04:43,630
A little bit about the problem at hand.

1204
02:04:43,870 --> 02:04:52,570
It could be the fact that you took a test about, you know, cancer awareness or knowing the signs of violence rather than my intervention itself.

1205
02:04:52,840 --> 02:04:56,440
That changes or results in more or less change in your outcome variable.

1206
02:04:57,910 --> 02:05:01,090
And so there are a lot of different ways that we can diagram a study.

1207
02:05:01,420 --> 02:05:06,100
This would be one where we have a control group, no pretest with the intervention.

1208
02:05:06,400 --> 02:05:09,040
There's little guideline means a non equivalent control group.

1209
02:05:09,340 --> 02:05:16,810
So you can take these different designs, kind of categorize them as predetermined, so quite experimental or formally experimental.

1210
02:05:17,140 --> 02:05:21,700
But then really for me it's trying to figure out right where are those threats to internal validity here?

1211
02:05:23,140 --> 02:05:32,290
If there was no pretest, does that rule out things like testing because you were never exposed to the material until after the intervention happened?

1212
02:05:32,620 --> 02:05:35,920
Right. So can you start to make some of those those changes?

1213
02:05:36,670 --> 02:05:42,879
Yeah. Well, are the threats of internal bleeding, do they have to be specifically explained in an article?

1214
02:05:42,880 --> 02:05:46,960
Is it something you just think about? What I'd say. Identifying it is great.

1215
02:05:46,960 --> 02:05:51,010
You don't have to tell me what it is. I know what they are. But this is why you feel that this is a threat here.

1216
02:05:51,670 --> 02:05:56,850
This is maybe what they could have done or should do in the future if they're going to try to replicate this stuff.

1217
02:05:58,570 --> 02:06:07,389
Just for last one, this is our formal gold standard experimental design, where we have three groups, we have random assignment.

1218
02:06:07,390 --> 02:06:11,170
That's what this stands for. And then taking them through,

1219
02:06:11,350 --> 02:06:15,969
how could you rule out certain effects or certain threats to internal validity if you can

1220
02:06:15,970 --> 02:06:20,740
randomly assign if it's true that these two groups were equal because of a random assignment?

1221
02:06:20,980 --> 02:06:23,290
What are some of the things we don't have to worry about?

1222
02:06:24,250 --> 02:06:29,080
A history threat not going to happen here because both of these groups would have experienced a history threat.

1223
02:06:29,440 --> 02:06:34,720
Maturation threat not going to happen here because both of these groups would have the same levels of maturation.

1224
02:06:34,930 --> 02:06:40,000
That's the assumption at least. And so any change we see is because of that intervention.

1225
02:06:40,540 --> 02:06:45,640
So thinking through your design and what you can reasonably rule out or identify as a particular problem.

1226
02:06:45,910 --> 02:06:51,280
Those are great. That's a great way to kind of critique articles, not just for this class seriously, but for other things that we're doing to.

1227
02:06:51,670 --> 02:06:55,040
So we're at time. Yeah. I mean, so I have a question.

1228
02:06:55,060 --> 02:07:01,930
So normally internal validity is the tradeoff between reality and external opportunity.

1229
02:07:02,290 --> 02:07:07,960
So if I design an intervention that's very specific for some new group of people,

1230
02:07:08,320 --> 02:07:15,220
so how do I take the result from that intervention and apply it to people from another country?

1231
02:07:15,650 --> 02:07:21,700
Yes, that's a great question. That's part of the problem with translation studies is very rarely can we operate in

1232
02:07:21,700 --> 02:07:26,650
such a vacuum that this would apply to outside of our very specific environments.

1233
02:07:27,820 --> 02:07:33,820
That's a little bit about the kind of implementation science work that's happening, which Sean Smith talked about a few weeks ago.

1234
02:07:34,540 --> 02:07:41,050
It could be taking your data and saying first, from a needs assessment perspective.

1235
02:07:41,350 --> 02:07:46,129
Just the experiment that we ran in Detroit, does that apply to Copenhagen or whatever?

1236
02:07:46,130 --> 02:07:50,860
Its where we're going to be doing some of the work. Are the needs the same? Does the external to do this?

1237
02:07:50,860 --> 02:07:55,690
Is the implementation look the same? Does the participants experience the program in the same way?

1238
02:07:55,990 --> 02:07:59,500
And then ultimately, can you also determine whether or not the effects are the same?

1239
02:07:59,920 --> 02:08:08,469
And so one example could be trying to recruit participants from multiple settings and allowing the effect of the intervention to I mean,

1240
02:08:08,470 --> 02:08:15,290
to test the effect of the intervention in those different settings. And that's what we saw.

1241
02:08:15,310 --> 02:08:19,120
And also, is it wise to do more like a pilot testing for first year?
