1
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Okay, Good morning, everyone. i'm still waiting for people to join. I hope you have the great weekend.

2
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:12,000
So. this is our third week in the last week of the course I know It's kind of a long process, especially during the summer.

3
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'll lucky to do the last week so so far we are online.

4
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
If you look at the course schedule we are on.

5
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Back to the number of 8. So today, we're gonna spend some time to wrap up number 8, and then we have 3 more lectures for the this coming week.

6
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:37,000
And this are a little long lecture, so some of them will take 2 days and up the homework quack, or lecture.

7
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
8 will be due tomorrow morning, and then there's wild for lecture 9 or one for lecture 10.

8
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
So, because lava will be completed on Friday.

9
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,000
So the exercise of the quiz for lecture, a lot of will not be required to submit.

10
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Nevertheless, your Mona welcome to work on them if you like, but that will that's not requirement.

11
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:06,000
And also this course will not have any exam. So you know the the the homework.

12
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You submitted, and your attendance, and all of those will be all that needed for your either the completion for the for your for your final rate of the credit.

13
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Okay, the reason I didn't put the exam is I know given that form of this course right in the very very intense every day.

14
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
So if I put an exam, I have to usually have to give a reviews session.

15
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I have to give time for preparation. that's what I did for you know who semester course like this in this summer for my I I just don't think that makes sense.

16
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Nevertheless, I will host some sample exam.

17
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I used to have when teaching them most like this. Yeah, some sample answer keys for those of you who might be interested, you know, has your own knowledge, but I will talk about it later.

18
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,000
But those courses are hot in the different kind of a focus, right with more focus on on that formula.

19
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:06,000
So you might find the the emphasis is a little different in those exams now. otherwise I will send you a at the ad for you as an exercising you want.

20
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:18,000
But this course won't have any exam so any questions before we start

21
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Okay, So last time we talk about lecture A, you still remember we talk about How do we do deal with categorical outcome, right for 2 group binary outcome.

22
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:37,000
3 can do either. The 2 sample proportion test which is very similar to to sample git that you look at. we start on one sample proportion test.

23
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'll give you a assume the null proportion.

24
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Then we move on the 2 sample proportion test.

25
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Then we talk about high-squared tests. as a generalization of the 2 sample proportion.

26
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Has the Chi for a test really work with multiple category and multiple you know, group and multiple outcomes right?

27
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
And now we talk about, how do we qualify? In fact, sizes right in continuous outcome.

28
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:08,000
We usually use the mean, because that's easy to do with not that's not the only thing we can we can use, but we the only when you mostly use the mean and the difference in the mean begin to group.

29
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:15,000
At 2.5, kind of cordial by the alcohol.

30
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
We have more than one way of qualifying 5 size, right?

31
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
We can still use the mean, which in this case is the proportion to.

32
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I use the difference in proportion between 2 groups at the back side.

33
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
But later on we also talk about ratio right which is different way of 25, 5.

34
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
So I don't know now they're the same in fact, size of you know.

35
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Difference means, because 0 is equivalent to say the original equals. One is also equivalent to say that the 2 variables are not associated right.

36
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
But today I gotta review a little bit more, you know.

37
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Why do we even do this? art ratio which is Similarly, you know strength.

38
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I'm sorry i'm running a little bit call with same phone.

39
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I guess that also you know it's a good thing that we are running is virtually right.

40
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Otherwise i'll be hesitating going to the classroom.

41
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,000
But now it's totally fine but just so bear with me sometimes I have some closing posts.

42
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Okay, not too bad, though. So i'll start with a review on the wide ward.

43
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:33,000
If you have any question, please let me know otherwise i'll start with you on a wide war.

44
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Okay, So and let's just focus on binary data because that's easy to interpret, right when you have multiple category.

45
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Somehow, your your group, basically, by autumnizing the binary.

46
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
So we have binary data. you may call me in many different terms.

47
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:59,000
For example, you because you can call it proportion sorry for my handwriting.

48
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I'm not a very good but if you don't have trouble recognizing just just ask me now. So what?

49
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:16,000
When when a quality of study is proportion or percentage

50
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Well, sometimes you call it rate, sometimes you probably the risk all of this, that for you have a binary outcome.

51
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Right. Essentially these are the probability of happening with with Al Qaeda, one happening in the in the population.

52
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
So the rate is a little bit more general. Sometimes people use rate.

53
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Sometimes people talk about rate when they associate with the the rate with a particular.

54
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:50,000
You know time scope, for example, when we talk about the rate of car accident, we didn't need to talk about every day or every month, or you know things like that.

55
00:13:50,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Right. But now the last in traffic is the binary outcome. we just you know whether you assign a Bible on with the time i'm here all Now but we'll talk about the rate of having a chance that we have to actually assign a

56
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:12,000
time here. otherwise you'll talk about a lifetime link. right? So putting that difference side, all of this term is when you have a binary outcome.

57
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:19,000
So in the medical literature, people often talk about the risk by the rest of getting particular disease, which is the same as the rate.

58
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:29,000
But you know you have to be aware that there is actually an underlying sort of a time interval associated right? The way of getting cancer in the next year, or the rate of getting has a lifetime.

59
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:35,000
There are different ways. right so sometimes they don't talk about it But you have to be aware of what race they're talking about.

60
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:41,000
But once we have the timing course time period you know specified, then the rest really is just a proportional.

61
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:51,000
It's just a probability right So let's just use risk from now on, because that's the medical terminology of the disease record at risk.

62
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Basically the chat you're getting I think go disease in a particular time plan. right?

63
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,000
So now we have 2 group right group, one and the group, too.

64
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Yeah, they could be a different kind of population. They could, you know, different kind of treatment.

65
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Now we have 2 group right in each group. Yeah, bye, mayor ask a question.

66
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Because in which being does the odds belong to because it's not really a percentage right?

67
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Yeah, the all these is is a derivative over the is actually a you know all the dirty over the risk.

68
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I'll talk about you the next 5Â min. Okay, Sorry

69
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:38,000
So now we have 2 groups, and each group have a population regarding how to define them. Right.

70
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Each population. you can define the risk that's quite our one or 2.

71
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
So now we'll be focusing on the risk r one R. 2.

72
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Basically the risk of developing something in each group. So if if Ry equals R 2, then we have H.

73
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Not. Basically, the 2 group has no difference right in terms of getting this disease.

74
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
So that's the same group as now apologies right if R.

75
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Were not equal to R. 2, then we have h eternity In this case.

76
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:15,000
How do we really quantify the difference? Right? Because, you know a group, one and group 2 could be a different population with different exposure that could be with different, you know. Treatment.

77
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
So on and so forth. I want to see what's the difference.

78
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
So let me start, you know, cause I don't have infinite space.

79
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I will start wing things up right. but you know these things will be in the in that. we can take your home, you know.

80
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Not so let's get rid of this so that I got some thanks for writing things right

81
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:44,000
So when they are not equal, so we qualify the impact size right?

82
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Usually we we use R one minus R. 2 so that's called A.

83
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:58,000
You know, absolute that press

84
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Your risk right? You see that that's the difference in risk right It could be r one minus r 2 r 2 minus r one, depend on which one you want to use the baseline or reference.

85
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,000
You will see literature. This is actually rarely used in my experience, and I'm not taking.

86
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I'm not not talking things as if there are i'm having this, as you know, from my home.

87
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Understand. I think that's the crypto thing you know you've got what I think, and you know you can read the textbook.

88
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:34,000
They might hop inside differently perspective. So so these are actually not so widely used.

89
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
So what's more widely used is r one divided by R.

90
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
2, and this is different. Apparently this is absolute, and this is relative Right?

91
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
So this this particular route quality is much more widely used.

92
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:55,000
They call the Rr. stands for relative rick 4 stars for respiration.

93
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Actually, I don't even know which one they stand for they just use R ar composed of this for short is all, but they are the same thing.

94
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:09,000
So you are part of the relative risk, and how the risk ratio is the same thing with the ratio between 2 risk.

95
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Yeah, if you have questions, please let me know. So why do people do the relative versus the absolute one?

96
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:28,000
There are many reasons why reason is because, you know, people think relative, you know, because different disease they have many different regrets, some of rare disease.

97
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
The risk itself is very low, especially if you focus on one year.

98
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Right. And if you talk about some comedy, the risk itself is hot.

99
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
So how do you really quantify a particular you you know comparative and across the disease?

100
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:46,000
People think a relative risk more it's more I think practically interpretal.

101
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I guess that's what the medical doctors they people don't like. I don't know what but you know you guys can tell me, nevertheless.

102
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
And the other thing is that the absolute risk difference sometimes for rare.

103
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:05,000
This is very tiny. But, for example, in one group, the risk, maybe 1% in the other group is 1 point, 2%. right?

104
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
R. one is 1%. R. 2 is 1 point, 2%.

105
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:15,000
And the absolutely, you know, difference in risk i'm using abr right Now, this is not a common i'm not just.

106
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I just don't want to write too much this will be minus 0 point.

107
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:24,000
2%. it's very tiny how one is very highly part of us to grasp how much how big it is.

108
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Also it's hard to make a dent when you're writing an article in a news news magazine right?

109
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Those kind of things, because it's a small number however, the relative rift here.

110
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
If you look at it, you know you let's just you the second one, divide the first one, because that's easy to see.

111
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,000
The relative risk is 1.2 right you have to say that's 20% higher.

112
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
You one group now, the other. The risk is 20% higher.

113
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:55,000
You one group can be out. That sounds a pretty significant amount so we'll call sort of a people who pay attention.

114
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I guess that's one of the reasons okay so that's relative risk.

115
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
That's all about you know i'm going to talk about risk, as you can imagine.

116
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
No matter how you qualify the fact. size, risk is really the math, you know.

117
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Practical termin logical measure, right? because the risk of development, I think a disease this is really useful.

118
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:27,000
However, you you practice many times. People don't read part of our risk to talk about all now is the time to talk about all.

119
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:34,000
So all it's just a directive over risk so so there's a one who one, or is bound up so postal risk.

120
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
We call it. we call the P. and all the we call the queue.

121
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
He on the queue. So they are one cool one for us, log into each other.

122
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
So from one we can get the other, and the equation is Q.

123
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Equals, P. divided by one minus P. that's just the equation.

124
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:00,000
So now from this equation we can make a table. Okay, this is P.

125
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:08,000
This is a queue, right? So we we Now we put out, you know, many different useful numbers, with 3 for the C right, for example, 0 point 0 1.

126
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:17,000
So one per cent. and 0 point 1 say 0 point 2 0 point 5 0 point 9 0 point. Why not?

127
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Let's see the corresponding queue what is the corresponding queue.

128
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
You can plug in the equation. Usc: Well piece 1%.

129
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
The queue is 1% over 99% that's pretty much.

130
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Still 1%. If you see that's 0, point 0 1 one all the way, it's almost the same, and then if P is 0 point, one, then the Q is point 0 point 1 1 one all the way, the P.

131
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Is 0 point 2 right Q is 20% over 80% that's about.

132
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,000
They're going too far I have piece 0 point 5 2 is what the P. is.

133
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:58,000
0 point 9. Q. is not the P. 0 point 9 actually is 99.

134
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Okay, you can. You can commit yourself by doing that calculation yourself, Right?

135
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
So what we learned here is that there are a few relationship, Right?

136
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:14,000
So number one P. and the queue. They are one to one corresponding to each other. Knowing key.

137
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,000
We can get queue. Yeah, I just here, I just show you one formula: right actually P.

138
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Equals Q. divided by one plus Q.

139
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Is that right? Yeah, Exactly. So Now you see, there are 2 formula: right can go from one to the out. This one to one person.

140
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,000
And second is, think about p always belong to 0 and what i'm sorry I'm using mathematical location.

141
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I just go a while called. Why long sentence? that would take time.

142
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
This means P. always falling in 0 and one. but now your Cq.

143
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:55,000
4 in 0, and the infinity. You can go about month

144
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:05,000
And the third thing, which is, I think, more Even the most important thing is that queue is always bigger than P.

145
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Oh, you could say bigger than equally P is 0. They are equal, right?

146
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:23,000
And the other point is that if P. is small, Q. is apart from the equal to P.

147
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
So you see the paper right. queue is always bigger than P.

148
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
The example in P is 0. Q is all 0, and when P.

149
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Is really small. You see that this 2 cases Q. is approximately equal to P. But P is large.

150
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Queue will be much larger than me. Yeah, give me a question, please, that you know.

151
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:48,000
But these are the port you know quality i'm going to talk about.

152
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:55,000
So this has a consequence

153
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Okay, I'm going to take a few things okay

154
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
So you might wonder. Queue is, you know, peace, probably interpretable.

155
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:23,000
We like it. Queue is not so interpretable Actually, personally, I don't even know too much about how to interpret 2 exception, you know, in in in the gambling industry.

156
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Sometimes we use this very long, right? for example, if you go a gamble website and saying, who is gonna win this year's a workout.

157
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
They have a bad, I mean I I often go to the batting laws.

158
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I don't know they will say who is gonna win the Us.

159
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Open, they will say, for example, how to off, you know, winning off, and sometimes they use a different locator for some time.

160
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Walk on it out as a winning all of 3, which really means he has a chance of winning 25%.

161
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Okay, because 25%, and the other one is 75% right?

162
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
The the of is actually one over 3. but people usually say also, use the larger one number.

163
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:16,000
So when you add the 3 that actually means that if you bet $1 that's gonna win the us open if you really, you know, got your back correct, you've got a $1, back and with about $3 a additional vote.

164
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Right. so the winning all is the none money you got all probably So that's pretty much.

165
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Only the place I see people use also in your real application. but in a medical literature He used a lot of odds, but I think you're convinced that you know, with me Now, the risk is what people really want to know right because

166
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:42,000
all of all is not so. Why, that he you don't know by the late late person, you know most people don't really know what all is.

167
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:50,000
So why do this view yourself? And that reason is because later on, with hardware and logist regression.

168
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:57,000
So you might have cases. Okay, I i'll i'll put it here, and then i'll revisit later.

169
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:10,000
So he's smart. What what does p small mean p small muth rare disease.

170
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Sorry for my handwriting, for rare this is, I mean, P.

171
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Small. In this case queue is roughly equal to P, and also we will learn.

172
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:27,000
A rare disease is very hard cohort to do cohort.

173
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Okay, covar study is part, But case control studies easy

174
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Remembering Paula. study, You have to, you know. Observe the outcome later.

175
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Right in row by exposure, and then observe the outcome later, or of zoom.

176
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
But because allcom is so rare, you need a very large sample size.

177
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I make it very hard for rare but case control study you.

178
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
You roll by outcome. that means even though it's a rare disease.

179
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:00,000
You can still go to the hospital, find enough patients of that disease.

180
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Now go back, figure out their exposure. so for rare this is case control study is easy.

181
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:15,000
That's why most often for rare diseases you see they conduct case control system

182
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Okay, and

183
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Later in the in the regression I would talk about. Well, cobra study.

184
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:36,000
You can ask him make Pete you're probably the p height right?

185
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Because you can do that for the case control you cannot.

186
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:57,000
You cannot, however, you can't estimate something called all the reason. Oh, wow!

187
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,000
You cannot ask me queue either. Back here. You cannot have my key.

188
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Therefore you cannot ask me the off, the the R relative risk this one you cannot cannot buff here.

189
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
You cannot ask my key. Of course you cannot ask me queue, because Q.

190
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,000
And key. must you note, while you know the other however, you can ask me something called ratio?

191
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
I'll show you let's switch it now while you're gonna estimate.

192
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,000
So you've got all the ratio

193
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Okay, because of a 2 group. you know, when you have group one, remember G One d 2, right.

194
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
You have A. P. one P. 2 correspondent. you have A.

195
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Q. One: Q. 2: Okay, let me wipe on I apologize for the small space that's where I ready Miss A.

196
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:51,000
It all viable or blackboard, not with the left right.

197
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:58,000
You have this, so relative risk equals P. One over p. 2 ratio equals.

198
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:07,000
We talk about the Q. One: over. Q. 2: Yeah. In case control study, you can get this one. You cannot get this one.

199
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:13,000
You can get all 3, and remember, for for rare this is q we don't know. Q.

200
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:19,000
But we know Q is approximately equal to P. therefore our ratio will be approximately equal.

201
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Relative risk, So that's the key right so you the case control study, with which is easy to conduct.

202
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:38,000
You know you rarely these. We cannot do anything, but we can get out, Rachel, and we know how Rachel will be close to relative risk.

203
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I, rather than risk is what we want. so we go all the people are going to all the ratio in the end, just to get rid of the risk.

204
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
That's what we want

205
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:54,000
So this is the finally. this is the thing we'd like but we still cannot get it, but we can get all the ratio.

206
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:07,000
This one we roughly can get. We got a ratio and we know operation will be similar to relative risk, because off will be several to to to risk So that's how we go all the way.

207
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:13,000
By the end I was all the ratio Okay, that's why you know the the thing we talk about your lecture.

208
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Why? Why do we even do audio? Because we use that to analyze case controls them

209
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Okay, Any questions, so far.

210
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:44,000
So I will revisit this you know later this week. when we talk about just regression, cause that's where you know all's racial and case control study will come back again.

211
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:51,000
But this is the rationale

212
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:56,000
So we'll read the literature right a lot of time to talk about ratio operation right?

213
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
So all's refo and the rather than risk they're not one to one corresponding.

214
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
So the Os and the risk are one to one by all grief from rather rich.

215
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
They're not going to one now the last for rare diseases.

216
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:20,000
They will be very close to each other that's what we even though so, for commonly this ratio is not really that useful? because you don't really know what's the underlying relative risk is of a red this is will be

217
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
similar.

218
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Okay, So that's why we're really literature we talk about hard ratio for cancer, for you know heart attack for other things right?

219
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Really. what they want is a relative rest, but they know the Audrey will be close to it.

220
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Okay, Any question.

221
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Okay, let me know. Go back to it. Lecture

222
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,000
So lot of time we talk about the spectrum we did 8 8.

223
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:18,000
We haven't. done 8 b and then there's a quick right so after the day you're starting 8 a end of the quiz.

224
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:31,000
And now we're gonna do a beta gather That's the way a little quick has you know it's kind of a just technical mostly using the let me share my screen.

225
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:36,000
The A. to be pretty technical, very similar to what we did earlier on this medical expenditure data.

226
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:42,000
But this time we again we study, You know, the regional difference and racial difference.

227
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:49,000
But now we okay, you know, categorical hall company is that So it's just an excel exercise.

228
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I like you to do a little bit, you know. maybe for

229
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:03,000
I see So maybe for how long 15 to 20Â min.

230
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Let's do it 15Â min. okay you don't have to finish, cause you don't have to turn in this one.

231
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Just get some p hands all on the excel and Then let's go with 50Â min. i'll review it quickly.

232
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Then we'll move on to our lecture 9 So today, again, just like before I is a new week, I will randomize new groups, but feel free to jump between groups.

233
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Or stay in the plane lobby. Any questions before I send you off to breakfast rooms.

234
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Yeah, I think i've already talked about how to use this spreadsheet here, right?

235
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,000
So that's and this the medical expenditure table here so that's all.

236
00:33:46,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Probably the need to do this exercise that's the recreated groups

237
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Yeah. feel free to stay in the lobby or account down between rooms, and I will make it 15Â min exercise.

238
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Okay, if there's no question i'll send you off no

239
00:34:34,000 --> 00:35:04,000
You in the bit

240
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Okay, welcome back. Just save the Simon. So

241
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:40,000
So working on this again, I mean, yeah, Pf: data.

242
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,000
So the only difference is that now we look at different holocaust.

243
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:50,000
It's all common always kind ofegorical physical activity, education, car smoking, and the general health.

244
00:50:50,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Right. So we guess that Us. regional differences. So what we do is to take I mean Ps data, and i'll take the regional difference.

245
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,000
You copy this column and go to the customer test.

246
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Now you put it here because that's use regional to define the to define the the groups right?

247
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:20,000
So now we have 4 regions, so we have 4 groups that's pay part of the fifth one.

248
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:28,000
This one do not apply under the outcome we will go to for the physical activity.

249
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Believe this this one physical exercise. So what means you have a lot of active file.

250
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:56,000
0 means you do not right. So cause busy call that's all this one and one means you have moderate or vigorous physical access, and 5 times a week 0 means.

251
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,000
You do not. So it's a binary outcome yeah let me know you have a question.

252
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Otherwise i'll just demonstrate these are the number you should be getting so.

253
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:09,000
If you got the same number. which makes it correct if you're not, you know.

254
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Please double chat So once you'll paste the raw data here and label the 4 groups. Now we have the This is the contingency table. it's supposed to be a you know 2 by 4 table or 4 by

255
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:32,000
2 temple in this case it's a 4 by 2 table doesn't matter, and all the marginal psalms and total sample size is my phone right So again.

256
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Let's put on the the regions to interpret that the regions are northeast midwest south and west.

257
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:54,000
You can still recall I saw this is let me put them here, nor north, east, mid west, south, and west.

258
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:59,000
So with this social, large lab sample size we have very high power, just like before.

259
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:07,000
The P value is highly significant, I think more interestingly is, Look at the relevant, you know.

260
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Proportional people have rigorous exercise, right for 5 days a week, each.

261
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Cool right. we see that the highest is the the west, and the second high is midwest.

262
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Glad to see that. but it's almost the same as northeast, and then the the South is the lowest again.

263
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:35,000
This will be more fun, more reliable if you have a hypothesis before you see the data.

264
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,000
And then, if you look at pairwise comparison, I remember.

265
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Let me ask a question: What after do we in Bonfaroni capture anyone?

266
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:58,000
We said, point 0 0 8, which was pleasure of 5, divided by 6 perfect.

267
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Thank you to point 0, 5 divided by 6, because we have 6.

268
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Pass right. the point 0 0, 8 i'll look at this there are only 1Â s everything that this one is no longer although it's last 1 point, 5.

269
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:19,000
So this one it's hard to see but because we only have 2 decimal places right?

270
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:25,000
No 2 digits after decimal. But suppose the surrounding no, not at all.

271
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:37,000
So this will be less than point 0 0 5. you can kind of change the this play format sales, not give you what they did more as how to use.

272
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Excel, the third is also 0. So this is the very time.

273
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:54,000
So this see what's d essentially is the lowest group versus the highest school is significant, which makes sense. And this is observational data, right?

274
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:58,000
So there is association, but don't make don't jump to the conclusion.

275
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:05,000
There is really a, you know, regional difference per se, because this may, be associated with some confounding factor.

276
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:13,000
For example, maybe people here are older than people here. No, no, people here are younger than people here.

277
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Something like that right? So there may be other component factor which are associated with both.

278
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Any question regarding this exercise

279
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:38,000
If not, I will be dumping very quickly for the second one, which is education, which is again 2 category.

280
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:43,000
So yeah, I would show you how to do that education here is last night High School versus High School.

281
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:52,000
So that's first go to education hi j location Keith So here agriculture is not binary, and we can only deal with binary.

282
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,000
I'll come in this spreadsheet right so I have to first make it binary.

283
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:07,000
So let's first copy it. Education let's talk quickly to the outcome column here, because it's not binary yet. right?

284
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:17,000
That's first basic here. Now, is is not you know binary let's convert it to binary.

285
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:21,000
So. how do we convert the binary with? First, it will separate by high school.

286
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:26,000
So look at education. So you look at all of this right?

287
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:33,000
So

288
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:39,000
I think one other 2 out of lower in a high school 3 animal, and above our high school graduates.

289
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Right. So that's how you read the table and convert them to. you know.

290
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:54,000
High school Alright, the one and 2 are now high school 3, and above our high school.

291
00:56:54,000 --> 00:57:02,000
So let's come back here. We could use a formula for example, let me try.

292
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Yeah, see if It's a function and then this number so greater than a high school would be greater than 2 anything greater than 2 will be high school right?

293
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Oops!

294
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Let's see what's going on

295
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:38,000
I see I have a I have a Okay, greater than 2.

296
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
I have to put it one on a 0 it's kind of stupid.

297
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:47,000
But so, if a greater than 2, this hour will take a value of one is the last one, too, or equal, we'll take about 0.

298
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:52,000
So you got a one means it's greater or greater than 2, right, and you'll double click this bottom right? honor.

299
00:57:52,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Everything is filled out here right? So this guy was last night high School, but this guy was less than high school, and so on, so forth.

300
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Dr. Jean, I have a question we could use volume W.

301
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:15,000
We click from calling V. Sorry from the medical expenses.

302
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Data Alright, you're you're right You're, right?

303
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Oh, yeah, You could just copy paste this one, right?

304
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:31,000
But it was good to see you do it, though. Sorry. Yeah, I I wanted to see you, do.

305
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:35,000
I convert to the binary, to binary results.

306
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:43,000
But okay, you could sell that to other be great. Yeah, this is cool, Mick: Thanks for that, you know.

307
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Yeah, but this will be you know if they don't have a mistake.

308
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:49,000
This will be the same thing as we. What we got here right this column.

309
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:54,000
So essentially this is the education, right? Things number here are less than 2.

310
00:58:54,000 --> 00:59:01,000
You see this one and this one you got a 0 if it's got part of that 2 or 3 you got one. right?

311
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:05,000
So basically, I put the formula right is like cell formula equals.

312
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:12,000
If the corresponding number, you know the right hand side is greater than 2 that you building of that value of one.

313
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Otherwise I just use this simple formula I convert this call into binary.

314
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,000
I guess it's just Yeah, thank you it's not a waste time, after all.

315
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,000
But yeah, but let me know it's a good good practice right.

316
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:31,000
If you could use this to convert variables in excel.

317
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Nevertheless, you know. Now let's go back to see that resolved right.

318
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:51,000
We have 4 rule, and that's how numbers and then p value and then the rates of people you know after high school midwest is the highest.

319
00:59:51,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Yeah. and follow the by northeast on the south and finally west. Yeah.

320
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:05,000
So you know, given the first and second question, you know, remember the last.

321
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:10,000
They exercise the most. They had the least high school race. I suspect they are the youngest.

322
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Oh, we have yet to see right. nevertheless. when you look at the caught up right I don't really know.

323
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
I guess I want to tear all of this into 3 digits.

324
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Otherwise it's hard to see should be number 3 videos.

325
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Yeah. So actually, Tara, on this one significant this one significant So it's A to D B to C.

326
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:43,000
And V to E. B. to D. Okay, This 3 pair are significant, different.

327
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:51,000
The other 3 pair of nothing in the different. Give me the number here.

328
01:00:51,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Any questions.

329
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Okay, Now I will do very quickly, because the approaching the break time.

330
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:16,000
But the third question ask about smoking car and smoking.

331
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:30,000
So it's just go get car and smoking which is alright. Take a little time to find current smoking right here.

332
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Just copy and paste so it's pretty simple that's Why, you know, I I think my colleague developed the spreadsheet.

333
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:42,000
I'll make things really simple. I just pace here just call on you can get up.

334
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:47,000
You can just stay there. I don't think delay is a good idea.

335
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Just clear it. Okay, so current smoker. Now, again, how is it?

336
01:01:52,000 --> 01:02:03,000
This is just very large sample by. So while midwest is the highest oh, bad the for worse.

337
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:08,000
And then the West has a lowest under the paralyzed.

338
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:12,000
There are all of them except a versus See the rest of the awesome.

339
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Everything.

340
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:24,000
I definitely you think it's not his result but okay there's a question to chat.

341
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Can you show again how you've got 6 tests and about Ronnie fraction, though.

342
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Yeah. So you look at. There are 4 groups, and we compare every pair of groups.

343
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:40,000
So they are a to be a to C, a to d b, to C, v, d, and C to D.

344
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Oh, we got 6 p values so that's why we divide 0 point 0, 5 by 6, and that's how we we got this 0 point 0, 8

345
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:04,000
As a call off. Yeah, from Bob Ronnie. Correction

346
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Okay, any other? yeah jackie if you've got the same answer And then i'll move on to the last one which is general health right? 2 categories.

347
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Very good accent versus, or how very good I got this time. I don't know whether we still have a binary all of those.

348
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Just take this column. I guess it's the same thing. Come back here and paste it here, and then go back to the thanks for the right general health here.

349
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:51,000
So 1, 2, 3 are good, 4 or 5 off there. This one also had one in W over India.

350
01:03:51,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Yeah. Oh, thank you. Then that same my time I guess my call it great is still calling for. Oh, for coming So let's just get W.

351
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Thanks so much, not for easier

352
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:20,000
I didn't know that fine. Okay, let me put down here Oops what's happened?

353
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:28,000
I gotta have the call back. Go back and then control C control.

354
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:43,000
V. Yeah. got It so again, it's highly significant and northeast and the South are the highest healthy one which is surprising to me.

355
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:50,000
I'll be they, you know, the sales remember the exercise the the beast!

356
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Why am I getting it? Hello! the definition? Let me go back.

357
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:02,000
One means general health is good, though excellent right i'm not wrong.

358
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Yeah. So the sauce is one of the highest in general health, except, you know, although they they exercise the least

359
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Yeah, thanks. Sarah will answer any questions in the chat.

360
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Really appreciate that. And then, this 2 almost high right almost high.

361
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:32,000
That's also consistent with the pairwise neighbors of C is highly insignificant, right so although you have such a big sample size.

362
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:36,000
There are queue out of the so hard, which means this tool number almost time.

363
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Similarly B. and A. B. North, a midwest under west, almost hot right, which is also consistent on pivotal.

364
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Here regarding the other 4 paralyzed. They are all significant.

365
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:57,000
So somehow northeast and the sales they behave one way and meet, left and West behave the other.

366
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:06,000
I I cannot explain this. given the other variables we have seen before. right, the age and the other thing. I don't remember the detail.

367
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:15,000
But remember, sauce was not very healthy per se. but this one seems to be very healthy.

368
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:27,000
So yeah, things surprising. Any question.

369
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Okay, this is the break time I I think i'm i'm just going to skip the the second part the racial comparison.

370
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:41,000
I think there's a racial comparison right the same analysis. you see different racial differences right?

371
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:51,000
And yeah, there's still a little thing let me Sorry i'll take a little time answering the very last question right?

372
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:54,000
I think we did all the regional. Another racial thing.

373
01:06:54,000 --> 01:07:11,000
I would just give on this question we already had some right yeah, Finally, there's this thing about 4 data by region, and then determine if there's an overall association of race versus General, how that define you want let me

374
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:16,000
try to answer. Sorry I take you a few minutes i'll i'll take a break after this question.

375
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:29,000
See how we do it right? So what they are saying here is that now we are looking at the region and region variable versus the house.

376
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Variable. Well, now, we're talking about can you stratify our region.

377
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Basically restrict yourself into one region, and then within that region analyzed the racial difference.

378
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:54,000
So look idea is that if you see a racial difference I also see a region difference, You don't really know whether the difference is caused by region or caused by rational or maybe other variable right here.

379
01:07:54,000 --> 01:08:10,000
We try to look at 3 bar by the time yeah the way we do that is to be stratified by one variable. We restrict our about to some value, and then only look at you know the la value and then analyze the date.

380
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:16,000
I'll do it very quickly. or maybe not something very quickly you'll follow.

381
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Well, now we have the we have, the reader. we talk how we we will stratify our region.

382
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:27,000
So we go to the region hollow. Yeah, right? We want to.

383
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:30,000
We want to analyze the racial difference in a specific region.

384
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:37,000
We do is how we go the data we do. If I still remember, we do this feuder click, this bottom computer.

385
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Now you can really feel about everything. all that for example region you can got you can.

386
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:48,000
I'll click this one click one but you've got everybody in northeast.

387
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Call me. So you click. Okay, Do you see that we have much fewer rows? it's still very long.

388
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:02,000
But now, you see the the row Index They are not continuous anymore. Right?

389
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:09,000
We're jumping between roles now we only keep the rows which in region one I in this particular region.

390
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:18,000
Now we can analyze race. are we popular race? And then we go to here.

391
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:23,000
We pay the here

392
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:33,000
I know we go back we say, for example, physical exercise, copy and paste key.

393
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Here.

394
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:42,000
So now, you see, we are only we are restricting ourselves to region one.

395
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Therefore the total sample size is not only 1,200, if you remember previously, we have 900 for other reason.

396
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Now everybody is in. you know this. this: go away because the full group now are different.

397
01:09:54,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Racial groups, right? Actually, there are 5 groups see if I remember happy the last one being being other or multiple. nottheless. Now we only have 1,300 subjects, because we restrict ourselves.

398
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:10,000
And you read your line. i'm not looking at the racial difference.

399
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:14,000
So we are. How is lower pivotal? Get higher, right?

400
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Actually, if you look at a fifth group now we have a 10 pair pairwise analysis. i'll keep it 0 point 0 5 over 10.

401
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:28,000
He started up 6. My social is, use the 0 point 0.

402
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:37,000
The 5. If you look at that, all this one a versus c. significant, which is, so because of some of that the lower i'll power is low.

403
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:42,000
Now the key amount is just priority, significant i'm only averted to see.

404
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:54,000
I forgot is maybe why this may be a his back basically the lowest group or the highest group that's

405
01:10:54,000 --> 01:11:02,000
Okay.

406
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:08,000
So

407
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Well, maybe i'm making a mistake. Oh, cause here they are asking for general help, not asking for exercise.

408
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:19,000
Let's just try to do the same thing so that's got the same data, right?

409
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:26,000
That's analyze general health here. copy this one is that and going back here.

410
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Put it here. Okay, So what? General? How? again? This time the queue value is obviously significant, because the difference are larger.

411
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:41,000
On the look at his confidence in the vote Well, I don't know.

412
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:55,000
Am I getting the right number

413
01:11:55,000 --> 01:12:03,000
Somehow I don't think i'm getting the right line number

414
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:17,000
It is region one general health. But yeah, I think the Okay.

415
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Now forget about it. I think i'm doing the right answer Key was wrong, anyway.

416
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Did you guys gonna get any of you got this number your regional one when you have the last general health that's what you should get.

417
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Yes, I got awesome. Thank you. I should fix the answer key I have, which is the setup.

418
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:44,000
And as I okay, anyway. So this is just to show you where you have 3 variables, right?

419
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:47,000
I mean especially only analyze 2 variable. Now you have 3 variable.

420
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:51,000
You want to look at region and the race and the outcome.

421
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:54,000
So one thing I can do is that you can stratify by reading.

422
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:59,000
I look at one region of time and within that region you can handle Ibm.

423
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:13,000
It's good. give you a more refined analysis got more you know interpretation out of there there's person accounts right process that now, when you stratify that reader, you're sort of a taking away the region so if there, if the region being a confounder

424
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:26,000
of race and Catherine House. Now the impact is up because you restrict yourself to the same region right for the downtown is that you have a You have a lot more results right which may be confusing people maybe conflict to each

425
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:32,000
other second is that you have a lower sample size in this case not to be the issue, because we still have 1,000 subject.

426
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:39,000
But in some cases it drop. Cohort is small, stratify, and we reduce the sample time. Right?

427
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:48,000
You have lower power, so that's why people have some other more advanced analysis, like, you know, multiple regression, which somehow do the stratification.

428
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:53,000
But do not do with this crude way. They rather put all 3 variable in one model.

429
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:57,000
I study their interaction, that'll talk about later, how do we do multiple regression.

430
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:01,000
But here, just you know. hope you understand the lesson.

431
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:07,000
Now we do this any question. People would take a break. Sorry about taking it so long.

432
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:20,000
A lot of finish this before moving out the new lecture

433
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Okay, let's have a 10Â min break and combat at 9 50.

434
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Thank you.

435
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:40,000
Okay, let's continue so now we have 3 lectures left.

436
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:50,000
So so far we talk about all different tasks, but they have a common theme, in a sense that they are comparing different groups alright.

437
01:24:50,000 --> 01:25:02,000
So in in Tithas, where even the all comments continues, we still have a categorical variable, which is an exposure which define the groups, and not to mention in the high school or proposal test the outcome

438
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:07,000
is also binary. So there are cases where both the exposure and outcome of continues.

439
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:14,000
So in those cases. If we want to use 2 sample tas or other things, we have to that compromise.

440
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:21,000
The the exposure bye what about we we don't want to documentize things because that lose information.

441
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:24,000
So can we just directly analyze the association between 2 continuous variables?

442
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:31,000
The answer is, Yes, but that would require new physical tools and That's what we're going to talk about today, and this week.

443
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Right. So this will be the hardware regression models.

444
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:38,000
And so on, so forth. So first I start a lecture.

445
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:54,000
So this is the case where, if you still recall in week, one actually day one, we learn this kind of data where there are 2 variable plotting on the X and Y access, and both are continues in this case is the average and file.

446
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:59,000
on ownership in each State. Where is the number of male power on suicide?

447
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:07,000
Right part part of 100 pay. So this is the scalar plot.

448
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:10,000
So each time is the observation and is a is a data point.

449
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:20,000
So you may ask me right you just I just said it's the number of male patterns, so it's at rate, by rate, I could have met 5 in an hour.

450
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:26,000
I really did not depend on which level of the observation we had about right.

451
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:33,000
When you talk about rate you're talking about the proportion in the population where every subject in the population is either yes or no.

452
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:44,000
So that is a binary. So a particular rate in a State actually means every single subject in the State has a valid alcohol.

453
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:48,000
Oh, here we go up a level. We are summarizing the rate across 50 states.

454
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:59,000
So now that the subject or the population is not individual, or rather states, so the rate now is not outcome.

455
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:04,000
When the States are not the subject right at that level it is the continuous outcome.

456
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:12,000
So I don't want to confuse you that's why I'm saying really depends on you have to think about what is the population of study?

457
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:18,000
Okay, Technically, we have a little bit usual here because there are 50 States right?

458
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:24,000
And then we have 50 data points here. so the population is small and we don't have a random sample.

459
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:28,000
We have a Basically, we have a hobby right these are called up.

460
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:34,000
What's that called that's called this other census. right?

461
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:38,000
So essentially you, you you measure every single data point in your population in this case.

462
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
You don't even need the testing you don't need a pivot.

463
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:46,000
You don't need any, because you have your day but for educational purpose, right for demonstration purpose.

464
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:53,000
Let's just assume we are getting 50 states randomly sample from a hypothetical unit for the number of States.

465
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:59,000
Okay and that's when statistic concept really works so this particular part is called scatterp.

466
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:06,000
So every single data point is measurement is a subject in the study, and then X and Y access are continuous.

467
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:16,000
There are 2 variables. Okay, and there are many thing we can do with the data like this. right?

468
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:22,000
So first of all, from the plot we can see there is some pattern in this particular case.

469
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:30,000
We call the Positive Association, which means, we sort of see a see, a tran, or see a pattern.

470
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:37,000
Where are the dots in the pop? go along this particular that We've had a Anthony? I don't know this.

471
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:41,000
Why is the diet the true that I know right? And this why is the Antioch?

472
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:48,000
Oh, not really. I mean this particular case. this is actually a dialogue, I mean, no matter how you card basically they call call on one.

473
01:28:48,000 --> 01:29:04,000
I don't know like this when they go along this time you know we call the Positive Association, which means the association between 2 variable is positive, which means this one variable is high the value for the other variable is also tend to be

474
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:08,000
high. Similarly, one marble has low value for some data voice.

475
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
Then the value for the other variable also tend to be low.

476
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:17,000
So they go along the same direction, both variable go along the same direction, changing the same direction.

477
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:26,000
That's called the deposit association the opposite would be if the if the pattern of the kind of part go along the other, I don't know that we call the negative association.

478
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:29,000
So 2 by looking at a paper where I didn't know what kind of leadership.

479
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:34,000
We have. Now we just need to call it by now just the physical tool.

480
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:43,000
Okay, if you have any questions, please let me know otherwise i'll move on

481
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:52,000
Okay, So the visual tell us the Directional Association did actually also tell us the strength of the association.

482
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:58,000
Basically how strongly, how or house gather those points.

483
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:08,000
This would be the audio right. The more sign concentrated they are along with the stronger association here, so can we quantify that the strength of the association.

484
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:14,000
Now we know the association is positive, Right? Can we qualify that?

485
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:24,000
So ideally. we want to summarize association into one number as a summary statistics which measure qualifies both the direction and the strength of association, and that particular number.

486
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:27,000
There are many artists for the most partly used by its color.

487
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:30,000
Pier says correlation coefficient for sure.

488
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:39,000
You can just call the correlation. When people say correlation, they really mean the Pearson correlation coefficient, although there are other type of correlation.

489
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:44,000
Okay, like a spear, Miss correlation, distance correlation.

490
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:48,000
There are many different kind of correlation. but when you don't say anything, just say correlation by default People mean this one.

491
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:55,000
So that's the most widely used one how to be specific would say, here's as correlation.

492
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:59,000
Okay, how do we qualify to qualify when you do?

493
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:03,000
First use some notation of the data right we already familiar that Xi.

494
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:14,000
That's more my roommate of subject I for Now for each subject, because, remember, we no longer have group design anymore.

495
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:19,000
All the data come from one single population there's no 2 group no 3 group.

496
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:25,000
We're not from Harry or class groups so now Xi.

497
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:36,000
Our office measurement of the first variable for subject hard, which in this case the rate of gun ownership in state are your eye rate from one to 50. If you count.

498
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:43,000
Dc. That would be 51 and then, why I it's not a second group.

499
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:51,000
Okay, why is the second variable? Is the fire on suicide rate for a man in state?

500
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:54,000
High. So Xi stands for 2 different variables rather than 2 different group.

501
01:31:54,000 --> 01:32:02,000
So I have to very helpful with the notation

502
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:09,000
So we also studied association between X and Y, but each X and Y has 50 measurements.

503
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:15,000
So how do we use? this? is our data, right? How do we use our data to summarize the peers and correlation?

504
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
We need to summarize all of this as one number.

505
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:22,000
Right so to do that. We calculate some summary statistic for example, X Bar Y Bar.

506
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:31,000
Now you're familiar with the notation right x Bar is just the mean of X Y Bar is the mean of Y.

507
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:41,000
Now, with all of this calculated we can define it here's some correlation using this monitor again.

508
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:48,000
This look like a complicated and you don't even remember it i'll just explain the Russian now.

509
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:56,000
So the idea is just like before we compute the deviation of every single observation from it's me, we Capital.

510
01:32:56,000 --> 01:33:01,000
X. I minus X bar for every single I and Why i'm on this Wi-fi.

511
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:10,000
Everything along. So if this quantity is positive we're taking, we are basically taking those observations where are their first variable is larger than the new.

512
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:16,000
Basically take high vibrations. So X bar minus X, I

513
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:25,000
X. I. minus X bar, is positive. We are looking at this observation, where there their management of the first variable on a lie on the high end, right?

514
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:30,000
And he this variable has a x y one that's like far being negative.

515
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:44,000
Or remember, Positive association means that on their first variable right management of the first variable on the high end. they're imagine with the cycle of our will also tend to be on the high end, which means that if they're a positive

516
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:48,000
Association, which means X I minus is far, and the Y.

517
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:55,000
I, minus Y Bar tend to have the same sign, which means when this one is positive, the other one also tend to be problem.

518
01:33:55,000 --> 01:34:02,000
When this one is large, the other one also kind of large that's positive association, i'm on this one is negative or small.

519
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:10,000
This one also tend to be negative or small. So how do we qualify that we just multiply them?

520
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:16,000
We are more about this tool, they will be positive. if this 2 are the same sign, have the same sign.

521
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:28,000
We are as popularity. If the product of this tool are negative, which means they have opposite sign, which quantifies a a negative association, right?

522
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:33,000
So we make a product of this tool for every single subject.

523
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:39,000
No, we take the average over all the subjects, because occasionally we could have one subject go out of the Tr.

524
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:48,000
Like this one do not really follow the trial they're They're a measurement for the first variable is below the mean, but their measurement for the second variable is above the mean the product.

525
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:58,000
For this variable is actually negative, but those are few. So what we do is how we we take the part of all the 50 management that would take average.

526
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:07,000
We got the overall track right and again. just how could be 4 When we take the average, we divided by n minus 5 rather than hand, just like everything we did before.

527
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:14,000
There's some some math reason there are not going into detail. but if you've essentially we're taking the average.

528
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:25,000
So the idea is that if this average this particular number is positive, that means for most of the this tool deviation go go in the same direction.

529
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:37,000
They have the same sign which means they're positive associated Similarly, if you take the you know, if this guy is negative, which means but most of the product, there are negative, which means the sign of this 2 term.

530
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:45,000
Well most of the measurements, they are opposite direction all this time, which means this negative association.

531
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:57,000
So this number actually measures the Directions Association, also the the the sign, I mean the direction, also the strength of association

532
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:02,000
But we are not there yet. This is not a pe since correlation coefficient.

533
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:05,000
Yeah, this one has its name for the sample covariance.

534
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:14,000
You see, the location is called Sx one. So this this, you know this: look something like sack.

535
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:19,000
Remember the Sx will be standard deviation like this looks like the similar formula.

536
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:27,000
This is called the sample Covariant. So essentially, if you look at it, if you party, why, as acts again.

537
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:35,000
So if you basically, if you take the sample for various of X against your itself, acts against itself, you can think about.

538
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:49,000
If you plot this figure, we're both access the same variable that all the dolls lie on this direction not only far, perfectly lie on the dialogue, then this variable really measures.

539
01:36:49,000 --> 01:37:02,000
How scatter they are along with iowa right so basically what you're planning X twice, you pretend it is 2 different variable, but it's actually a duplicate the same variable like this formula will exactly

540
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:07,000
be turned through the sample variance effects we'll take square root.

541
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:12,000
You got a sample standard deviation. So these are the generalization of the variance.

542
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:20,000
Remember the variance is a standard eigenvector square but now it's generous for metric the association of various of 2 variable as well.

543
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:29,000
So please do Now you'll just come out by themselves they're all related.

544
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:33,000
But this thing do not really measure the pure sense cards.

545
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:38,000
Yeah, although it's very very much related because this Guy depends on the unit.

546
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:46,000
Imagine which means, if your access match, or say in interest, will you measure low?

547
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:49,000
Oh, versus ads is Matthew. Yeah. meters.

548
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:57,000
This quality will change. Therefore, the call guys working right. So this covers depend on the unit of management which is not ideal.

549
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:03,000
Will that get sort of a standardized or normalized by the unit so that make a unit free. a unit.

550
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:10,000
Free version of this naval variance will be this pier, since correlation

551
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:18,000
So we go once. that father on the top is basically the the sample for us.

552
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:31,000
We just introduced, and on the bottom here in this ratio, we divided by the square root of the sample covers of X by self, which is actually the middle of Here is the sample various events.

553
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:39,000
We take square root that's the sample standard deviation Max Sf: Also that's why so we take the Sxy divided by Sx, and as well.

554
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:43,000
We already learned all of this, just putting them together form a pretty scary phone number.

555
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:53,000
But we already learn each part 3 parts, right? So this way they will take all the measurement unit, you 5.

556
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:58,000
And it was standardized. So this is a standardized version of the several covariance.

557
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:06,000
We call it art. Go ask me why they use r they just use all I don't know why is a convention.

558
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:10,000
I have a you got where this come from, so that the R.

559
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:21,000
Is a convention to you know the pure sense, correlation, coefficient

560
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:28,000
So what's nice thing about it there this this particular r has many many nice property which I will summarize the next slide.

561
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:37,000
Hopefully buffalo it's known as predicense partition, coefficient, or for short peersense correlation, or even for short correlation.

562
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:41,000
When you say correlation, keep assume you're getting this and then the R.

563
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:48,000
Because it's standardized by the measurement unit our has a range from minus one to one.

564
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:58,000
You never go below minus one. Never go about one so that's not

565
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:06,000
Yeah, if you have a question, let me know otherwise i'll move on I'll show some figure before I summarize the properties.

566
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:11,000
So these are some sample, or you could call textbook example of different correlation.

567
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:15,000
Coefficient are the talk about right? when the data points go along.

568
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:20,000
This time, you know, R is positive, the core. The correlation is positive. In this particular case.

569
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:28,000
The correlation is 0 point, 7, 8, which is positive, right saying, the the points go along.

570
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:32,000
This type of this title overall and the strength the R.

571
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:37,000
Always have a value between minus 1 one right, the larger the value, the the stronger the correlation.

572
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:41,000
So 0 point 7, 8 is sort of a moderate to strong correlation.

573
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:48,000
You see the points they somehow concentrated along the diagonal, but not perfectly concentrated.

574
01:40:48,000 --> 01:41:01,000
It's a little bit scary, that's part of this this sort of a moderate level of art similarly this is R equals minus 0 point 7, which is almost like this one.

575
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:06,000
But go the other diagram, so there's also a moderate correlation.

576
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:19,000
What negative one. So basically, if you look at this figure what's your once you are familiar with this right Look at this figure, you will guess are equals about point.

577
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:23,000
7 to point 8. Look at this one you guess r equals of all negative points out of Point 8.

578
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:28,000
You don't know the exact number of for sure that's fine.

579
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:35,000
It's very easy, I guess the man magnitude you know relatively accurately.

580
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:38,000
And the third one is the case where the party is 0 point 4.

581
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:50,000
We see that the concentration of the points a lot of the Anglo is much loose than the first one that that's reflected by the magnitude of the collision going much lower right 0 point 4.

582
01:41:50,000 --> 01:42:05,000
But the direction I see roughly still this time. So when I, when I give you this figure in the future, if you will guess it is a positive, but you know a little weaker partition.

583
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:16,000
How if I give you a partition 0 point 4 you should have a it's kind of plotting in your mind like this. but once you'll see like a 100 schedule like this.

584
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:31,000
You got the impression, and similarly the fourth one here or the first. in the second row is a negative 0 point, 4 bye, which is a weaker correlation.

585
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:35,000
But go the other diagonal. You see that all these points are random, right?

586
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:43,000
So every single figure is different. So you cannot really exactly figure out where the pitch coin is, and that doesn't really matter.

587
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:47,000
We just look at the overall time. This one is negative 0 point 7 there.

588
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:52,000
That gives 0 point 4 on this one. it is 0 point.

589
01:42:52,000 --> 01:43:03,000
1 9 is a really weak, positive correlation it is so weak visually. it's very actually it's not hard to see the track at all right.

590
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:08,000
You can see they're trying to go in one day even though it's probably stronger than it's going the other day, though.

591
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:17,000
But it's very hard to see already so that's reflected by the very weak, positive partition

592
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:27,000
Finally, this is r equals 0 point 0 one which is almost 0 of hardly have 0, which means there's no positive or negative trial at all.

593
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:30,000
And that's the case here if I don't tell you the R.

594
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:33,000
You cannot really tell whether they go one diagonal and the other.

595
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:38,000
Probably neither right that's reflected by a it's such a weak, hard issue.

596
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:46,000
It's almost no correlation

597
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:54,000
Okay, So after this bigger you should be able to translate between number are versus this schedule pop, corresponding to me. Right?

598
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
If I give you a scalar you can make a guess of the R.

599
01:43:56,000 --> 01:44:09,000
You should get it roughly, right, not accurately, but right

600
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:25,000
And there are exceptions. i'll talk about later. but for now you know this should be your impression right about what our characterizes overall time, but not every single pay the point right You can imagine there are an infinite number of

601
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:31,000
scalar. P. give you exactly the same arm, because, turning from Apollo art, we are making a reduction.

602
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:40,000
We are dropping the information about every single data point, but summarize overall pattern with one number.

603
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
So each scalar has a specific R. but Hr.

604
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:48,000
Corresponds to infin number of calls.

605
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:52,000
Alright. So now i'm going to list all the quality of all right.

606
01:44:52,000 --> 01:45:00,000
All the useful ones right they'll probably up here some cardiac and coefficient.

607
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:08,000
It is used to measure role. This is not P. This is a role the College of X and Y in the population.

608
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:17,000
So it turns out that this r you just like X bar, just like as bye.

609
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:23,000
It is a sample. statistics who compute R, and you can plug in the data.

610
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:28,000
So any samples, statistics actually measure the corresponding population paradigm.

611
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:32,000
In this case the popular parameter is called the role.

612
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:35,000
So the role is just like the meal or the Sigma.

613
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:42,000
The are so like the X bar or the yes, by the R is the sample version.

614
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:49,000
The role is the population problem. They are with me. the no patient.

615
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:53,000
Hi, So the R. is used to have made rope, and the row is the population of correlation.

616
01:45:53,000 --> 01:46:11,000
Between X and Y. is a population parameter so how it's actually run. I will be close to what when the sound of as long and r is unitless, which means you can change the unit of measurement the value of r

617
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:25,000
doesn't change, in fact, any linear transformation of the data we'll keep you all our unchanged, which means you can change from sending me to to neither. You can change from pound through color kilometer.

618
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:36,000
Oh, no, little kilogram. Those scaling will not change our more than that, you have to shift your data, because here, in computing hard, we are subtracting the mean, which means if you shift to me it doesn't

619
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:43,000
change. That's the case when you're for example change from Cousis, who farah remember from salesis to parenthood.

620
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:49,000
Not only we scale, we also share. so if you measure sales it's a paran height, the r doesn't change, because R.

621
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:56,000
Is independent of any linear transformation, including shift a location or scaling.

622
01:46:56,000 --> 01:47:14,000
So that's very nice and our roughly measure the stress of the association, or call a linear association, which means if X and Y, or any pattern or unassociated Well, i'm correlated they mean different thing is that this is But for our purpose here they mean the

623
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:24,000
same if they are not associated, being already the population role equals 0, and the sample version R will be approximately 0. because R.

624
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:30,000
Is a random, right random quality. it will not be exactly 0, but be very close to it.

625
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:34,000
An arm has a range from minus one to one which means if it's negative.

626
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:41,000
There's a negative association. the caller is from minus one.

627
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:47,000
The stronger association is sending for for what? So what does the R equals?

628
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:52,000
One or minus one mean. The army is perfect linear association, which means all the Paul.

629
01:47:52,000 --> 01:48:00,000
All the points, we will lie perfectly on the diagonal, which, of course, will not happen with real data sense.

630
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:03,000
Right. So in real data size you could have our goal as close to one as possible.

631
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:13,000
We never really perfectly got a correlation one because that's sort of artificial

632
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:17,000
So in the end are in the row and the sample of population version.

633
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:22,000
Oh, peers and correlation! they only measure linear association.

634
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:27,000
So if the trend is there. But now linear this intuition might change.

635
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:33,000
I'll show you example later on

636
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:42,000
So there are many problems, but we'll get useful then we naturally, and this Pearson correlation essentially just pick a number summary at the figure.

637
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:48,000
The peers on college, and not only is independent of the unit it's also independent of X and Y.

638
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:52,000
If you look at a formula you can flip. Excellent!

639
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:56,000
What? Because swap excellent law, you can take access the first variable?

640
01:48:56,000 --> 01:49:00,000
Why, in the second bar, in the sense that you can change your role in the column.

641
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:12,000
Right. I flip your paper along this dial the peers and all that does not change, because the formula that's not why they're symmetric

642
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:19,000
So later on we'll talk about later on today. with how about a different way of summarizing the region.

643
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
We have to know why, but asymmetrically.

644
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:27,000
Then we talk about the linear regression so that's analyzing the same data about the user different tool.

645
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:32,000
But now that they're already there we have to distinguish right correlation, and the regression they're not the same thing.

646
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:48,000
Correlation is symmetric between the 2 variable and regretting is not symmetric the question cares which one is the exposure which twice the alpha, but correlation, doesn't care.

647
01:49:48,000 --> 01:50:00,000
Any questions, for far

648
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:08,000
Okay, So going back to our original data, this one, this data.

649
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:15,000
Now, you see, the the china is pretty clear that is relatively strong, so cool. if you'll otherwise right.

650
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:23,000
If you ignore this data point, I will say that the correlation is rather strong, strongly positive.

651
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:30,000
So if you really plug in the data, your computer correlation, you got R equals 0 Point 8, 4.

652
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:41,000
Hello! very strong right close to one. So this positive and a strong correlation not me.

653
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:52,000
Space with gun ownership race that above the us average tend to have higher rates of firearound with later so that means they have pocket association.

654
01:50:52,000 --> 01:51:04,000
It doesn't rule out all our there could be a one or 2 States which doesn't follow this trend but overall most of the State, however, trend

655
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:08,000
So the Pearson cart is a good some, you know.

656
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:12,000
Summary statistic, measuring the strength of the association.

657
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:19,000
But just like everything we did before the pearson correlation is a statistic which means it's random.

658
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:25,000
Every time you're draw a new sample the day that we will change

659
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:33,000
So can we assign, you know, a common reasonable to it, and we assign a key value to it.

660
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:37,000
2 to take into consideration the the sampling vulnerability. right?

661
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
So the Pearson collision will have a sample in the trigger as well.

662
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:44,000
Not quite in this particular case, because here we already got data from office, 50 states.

663
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:50,000
But in the other cases, or in the imaginary world where we have nuclear number States to pick phone.

664
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:58,000
Then there's a company so how do we do it turns out that we could.

665
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:05,000
We can set up and all have other things. The population correlation is 0 versus the population.

666
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:13,000
Correlation is not 0. So this go one example: pass on correlation coefficient.

667
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:27,000
I know we use the R. but you know the single and the absolute value of the R will be the thing, though, because the bigger the absolute value of R, the stronger signal against the null, and turns out that because our is a the statistic

668
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:30,000
it has assembled the distribution. It has a standard error.

669
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:34,000
It turns out that it's standard arrow is associated with the Rsl.

670
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:41,000
As well as the sample size by this monitor

671
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:51,000
I am not going to show you, apparently, how to get this, but on the line principle is again Okay.

672
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:55,000
So central limit theorem. apply to anything where you take the average.

673
01:52:55,000 --> 01:53:09,000
This is the average. This is the average this is the average Well, now, we'll take average things will start to be normal additionally, and then we can use the property of normal to qualify the those standing arrow that's why this phone or you know

674
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:22,000
is not random people put it out for a reason. Excuse me.

675
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:28,000
Oh, you'll get the value of our plugin is folder, and also with sample size, and takes for this thing will be the standard hero.

676
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:34,000
Oh, Bar, and then, once you understand Arrow, you can do anything afterwards right for double.

677
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:39,000
You can take the ratio of absolute value bar you buy about a standing arrow.

678
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:46,000
Now you've got a statistic which again is the p statistics just like people.

679
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:56,000
So in this particular case we plug in 0 point 8 4 divided by one minus 0 point, 8, 4 square over sample has n minus 2, 50 minus 2, and takes for root.

680
01:53:56,000 --> 01:54:01,000
You'll probably have about 10.8 2 and if I tell you this is the you immediately know.

681
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:13,000
It is highly significant, because it's way. bigger than 2 Where's that P. by a turnout will be left on Point 0 0 one right which will have strong evidence against them.

682
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:17,000
Now

683
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:24,000
So we know the correlation is real it's not due to random sampling.

684
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:35,000
Similarly, you have construct a 95% comedy level, just like, before you take the point estimate plus minus 2 times standard deviation.

685
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:39,000
Once you're getting the numbers you've got this is the common level, right?

686
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:45,000
So remember the correlation coefficient r We got was 0 point 8, 4 factory there's an interval wrong.

687
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:48,000
It 0 point 6, 9 to 0 point 9 9 that's the 95% common level.

688
01:54:48,000 --> 01:55:08,000
You see that is common about does not include 0, which is the null value which is consistent with the fact that Kevin is significant

689
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:11,000
So these are the cruel way of getting a company in the world.

690
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:17,000
This common number works, but it's not ideal because the way we do this R plus minus 2 S.

691
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:21,000
E. we could announce it with a common level. Go about one.

692
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:27,000
You know the the case that we only got a 0 point 9 9 at the upper volume, just by log 5.

693
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:30,000
This, the standard error is a little higher. this will be above one.

694
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:40,000
And how do you accountable about one it's not wrong? This interval still has the frequency property approximately well sympotically mentioned?

695
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:47,000
Some of that large it's still covers but just are nice, because we know that we know the correlation coordinator cannot go about one.

696
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,000
What? What does that mean? to have a common level, you know.

697
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:56,000
Go about what right in those case, you could strong connect to go to one at most.

698
01:55:56,000 --> 01:56:03,000
I could just deliver it it doesn't matter

699
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:12,000
Nevertheless, there are more than one way to construct how in the whole, and there are more accurate ways where they're accommodating the vote.

700
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:23,000
You know, never really go about one of the low by not as well, so what I'm just to say that this is just one simple way to construct commenable. if you use the digital software you may get a different in the hoping level this

701
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:27,000
one. So this is the interval got from us, the physical software.

702
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:32,000
They use a different matter. You see that this interval there are several policies personal.

703
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:40,000
This interval is shorter than this interval. The lower bound 0 point 7 4 is higher than the lower bound here.

704
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:45,000
That was higher and low, higher than the year, So everything else equal a shorter to the interval.

705
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:52,000
The better, which means the physical software is using a better matter together, bothering them.

706
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:59,000
So all the interval we all have at least 95% coverage which is good for this one. they are shoulder.

707
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:11,000
So that's not, and also you see that this interval So the you know what we got like this right they always center around the value of point at me, because the 0 point is for plus minus the same.

708
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:15,000
Number. So the sign of this need of was 0 point 8, 4.

709
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:20,000
Well, the center of this interval is not 0 point 8 4, because they were got using a different formula.

710
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:24,000
Not this one. So there are many different methods. We got a company novel.

711
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:28,000
Why you got from those things. The software may not be the one we have here.

712
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:38,000
Are they all validable? Okay. So you know.

713
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:42,000
So one easy way to get interval that never go beyond one would be.

714
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:48,000
Take the log, not the lock. you know yeah it's hard to pick the log here.

715
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:56,000
How you feel the log of this number i'm saying it's hard to think in the log, because this number can take a negative right.

716
01:57:56,000 --> 01:58:04,000
But suppose you ignore the sign and take the log of this value, and then get an interval on the log scale and then transforming the back.

717
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:14,000
Right Now I have another problem in this particular case you can you know I haven't talked about it, but this is the between 0 and one.

718
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:19,000
When you do a transformation for example, you've got to corresponding all of this number?

719
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:22,000
And then getting into one of all scale and then cover it back.

720
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:33,000
Then the Intel will actually never go beyond one. So there are some mathematical tricks to construct intervals which never go out of the range. Your mind and find one. but those interval will not be symmetric around me so you know

721
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:40,000
each otherwise post on account not going too much into those those are sort of a secondary.

722
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:45,000
Let's go back to the data

723
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:51,000
So let's see the trauma is go along this diagram.

724
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:57,000
But different data points have different distance to the dialogue.

725
01:58:57,000 --> 01:59:01,000
Right. Some data points like this one. They lie perfectly, almost perfectly out of that.

726
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:11,000
I know, for some data point like they were far away from the dialogue

727
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:17,000
And some data points like the middle one. they have above average in both measurements.

728
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:30,000
But someday the points like the extreme ones, they have measurements, you know, that are extreme park from average

729
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:51,000
It turns out that if some subject that hung up that has has a unusually large or small value of x or Y, or both, then they have a large influence on the value of a bar, so basically the points in the middle they don't

730
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:54,000
matter too much, but the points on the pages or outliers.

731
01:59:54,000 --> 02:00:02,000
They might have walked down the points in the middle

732
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:12,000
That's Think about example. suppose we take the 3 points here how we move it down here.

733
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:17,000
So we changed through the measurement. the 3 data points

734
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:26,000
And then in this sort of a compounding new data set which look like this, the Carly, and will be dropped to 0.

735
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:32,000
Point 8, 4, 8, remember. the original one was 0 point, 8, 4, which is strong correlation.

736
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:48,000
Now we have a sort of a moderate collision. We just change 3 of data points

737
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:55,000
Okay, some already. You have a thing that I look like this.

738
02:00:55,000 --> 02:01:00,000
So the majority of the data lying in the bottom left corner.

739
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:05,000
But 2 data points are far away on the upper corner.

740
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:13,000
Now we have a car. They have 0 point, 3 5, which is again rather weak

741
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:19,000
You ignore this to data point if I ask you what's the question just by looking at the remaining 48 data points.

742
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:24,000
You will say it's almost 0 right there's no trial at all.

743
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:32,000
So the correlation of this r equals 0 point 3 5 is almost completely driven by this 2 outliers.

744
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:44,000
So i'm just trying to say that correlation coefficient appears as corresponding coefficient are sort of a sensitive to allliers just like a mean like a standard deviation like anything we do they're a

745
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:50,000
normal bus for all of us to have to be careful of those that department, the downside of parametric opponent.

746
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:57,000
What i'm trying to say is that by by seeing a r don't assume all the data points are nice.

747
02:01:57,000 --> 02:02:07,000
You have to visually examine the figure. so, pulling back here from the R, you can sort of guess the figure.

748
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:13,000
But this figure are sort of the good example on their input though but they're also bad examples.

749
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:19,000
Where from the R. you cannot possibly see the figure because they are driven by outliers.

750
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:34,000
If I tell you what r equals 0 point 4 you are probably thinking about this one, not this one.

751
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:41,000
I'll be over this kind of example exists yeah That's good question.

752
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:56,000
Is it like that the R. steel 0 point 3, 5, and not lower in this figure, because the 2 outliers are more or less on the ideal line that you could draw between these.

753
02:02:56,000 --> 02:03:03,000
Points. So, for example, if those outliers were not on the ideal line, the R would be very much lower.

754
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:08,000
You're absolutely right if the 2 points are here is that then the call.

755
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:13,000
It would be pretty much 0. Well, here will be 0 you're right?

756
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:18,000
So their location. how far away things like those definitely matters.

757
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:21,000
But you sign what i'm saying the r depends on all I so be careful.

758
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:27,000
You always want to visually check your data, Not just look at a number itself.

759
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:34,000
The number is useful, for the figure is also useful. So this is the case when we get rid of those 2 data point.

760
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:44,000
Now the r is almost 0.

761
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:51,000
This is a very funny case here. is of course it's very very artificial.

762
02:03:51,000 --> 02:04:05,000
But supposed to have data perfectly lie on is sort of a kirk

763
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:08,000
You can give you a computer correlation. use the same formula.

764
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:14,000
You can always do that. it's almost 0 the r here is almost 0.

765
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:23,000
Or remember, r equals 0 means X and y are not forward, or you could translate that little more to X and y are not associated.

766
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:29,000
X and y are independent like my save your X and y are not associated.

767
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:39,000
Do you really believe me if you look at it right every single value of act will uniquely determine the value of one.

768
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:50,000
There's no sort of a randomness here. I file actually one year old, almost perfectly associated, are associated.

769
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:55,000
Mean. we may not know in the Violet. You know a lot of information about what you can guess.

770
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:59,000
Why, very accurately, time is associated. So here I know why, are highly associated.

771
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:16,000
Yet their correlation 0 that goes to this property of pearson correlation here's some carl even a major being your association, which means, when the solution is linear which means things lie on the line here's some hard they

772
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:24,000
can calculate the association pretty well. 5. The association do not lie on the line, but rather rely on the curve, which is nonlinear.

773
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:30,000
The Pearson party is pretty much useless

774
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:50,000
So that's another. hey? home message right you always need to Look at a figure, the scanner part after a computer correlation, even before you come to the corporation

775
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:54,000
Okay, So this is summary. Pearson. correlated.

776
02:05:54,000 --> 02:06:00,000
Coefficient is a measure of linear association in the previous bigger.

777
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:09,000
The association is not linear it's Quadratic therefore the Scatterpot. you could you should always look at a scatterpot right, not just the peers.

778
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:23,000
And correlate that not just a number. If the pattern of the schedule is not, linear, then you should use other magic association, not peers and social? Are there are other correlation, coefficient like spearman like

779
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:32,000
decor other things. Some of we will characterize this kind of association

780
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:41,000
Finally. Yep. if you are you know, pearson's correlation, measure the social between 2 continuous measurements. Give one unknown, or both of them are continues.

781
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:49,000
Be careful. You may not want to use Pearson correlation, even though I still compute it.

782
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:55,000
They have some little patient. alright, the post variable, I mean.

783
02:06:55,000 --> 02:07:09,000
You've one marvelous is finally the otherwise continues you got computer, You know that the the difference it means right. if both are binary.

784
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:15,000
You got computer difference in proportion or relative risk for all ratio or many things? right?

785
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:19,000
You guys do computer appearance correlation and they are still a little useful.

786
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:26,000
I'll be what where they have limitations you know continuous marginal.

787
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:34,000
So this is a cartoon following the limitation of here since correlation in this 4 stop clause.

788
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:38,000
We have 4 scholar paths, I mean all of them.

789
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:46,000
We have a pearson correlation, coefficient of 0 point 7 only in the first part.

790
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
Here you have a good case where this is. A textbook.

791
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:53,000
Example appears on correlation. 0 point 7. So this is the case.

792
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:58,000
You wouldn't expect you would hope for always level check because the other 3 cases.

793
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:04,000
You also have appears in correlation. 0 point 7

794
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:09,000
These cases the one we just show right. most of the data.

795
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:14,000
Our distribution in this blog, where the Pearson caring here is pretty much 0.

796
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:23,000
Well, you have a outlier, but one of all are far away which drive the whole peers. And, Carl, it will be 0 point 7.

797
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:35,000
This is not what you want right. If your statistic changes greatly by removing one data point which means it's not reliable, which is not a case.

798
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:39,000
Here. If you remove any data point here, the peers and carrier will not change much.

799
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:48,000
Why did not case new? These are the case where you'll have a sort of a nonlinear association?

800
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:55,000
I could say, you have a whole bunch of outlier we're gonna say you have a subpopulation. this piercing car.

801
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:57,000
They have point of 7 is also not as reliable as this one.

802
02:08:57,000 --> 02:09:02,000
Maybe by this one, but not as good at this one because There's a nonlinear association.

803
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:15,000
You may want to try some others technique like transmission which i'll show example later.

804
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:25,000
Finally, this is the case. we haven't talked about this is the most difficult case.

805
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:31,000
After the most Chinese, because this one you can do Now, this one you can see immediately this thing right now.

806
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:39,000
It seems strange, but if you know this 5 4 of us drives they are more scattered. They will make together.

807
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:56,000
It's actually very hard to see this is a very strange case, because if you look at all overall trends, the data follow diagonal, and according to 0 point, 7 it's moderate too strong, right a little moderate higher on a higher end, on

808
02:09:56,000 --> 02:10:09,000
the you would imagine the data? Look like this but actually look like this, which means that the whole population of data actually have 5 soft groups.

809
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:12,000
You don't see them just by looking at correlation.

810
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:17,000
But you see them when you plot it what's more within each stop group.

811
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:30,000
If you look at only look at one component here. the courage is actually strongly negative.

812
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:36,000
Right. So this so the variable of x and y overall they're positively associated.

813
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:40,000
But within each sub populator they're highly negative associated.

814
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:48,000
These are signal trial, confounding.

815
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:52,000
You may think this is too artificial. Well, let me give you a example.

816
02:10:52,000 --> 02:11:03,000
Where this actually make a huge impact in practice. Okay, I would just talk here.

817
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:13,000
Suppose.

818
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:25,000
Suppose we have 2 variable on the access side is hi on the Y.

819
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:32,000
Access is vocabulary.

820
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:37,000
Okay, all of this are from kids

821
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:44,000
And then you'll you've got a whole bunch of people 100 of them trauma automatically.

822
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:47,000
School. You imagine they're hide you measure their vocabulary.

823
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:51,000
You can't do both right and then you make a scalar part.

824
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:58,000
So post this got a paul look like this

825
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:01,000
Okay, that's pretty much the scalable look at I Don't imagine the correlator.

826
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:14,000
You see, R. equals 0 point 8 very hot, which means high and vocabulary are positive, associated

827
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:19,000
That's what you see from update and that's very confusing.

828
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:27,000
Because how come the high end of the cavalry has anything to do with each other?

829
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:36,000
And then it turns out that that's because of compounding because there are actually several groups.

830
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:46,000
This is worth great, and this is fifth grade

831
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:51,000
Right. you are mixing kids from different grades together. apparently Fifth grade will be taller now.

832
02:12:51,000 --> 02:13:03,000
First grade i'll have a big over category right So all your strong correlation, 0 point 8 is driven by this kind of founding of great

833
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:16,000
How you can restrict kids within the same grid you will see Hi and vocabulary has nothing to do with each other just because you're polar doesn't mean you have bigger vocabulary

834
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:21,000
Right. So way of control for great the straw associated and go totally away.

835
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:25,000
And this is a given worst case where it means that if your control for great.

836
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:33,000
Actually they're associated. it's the taller you are the smaller little cover You'll have apparently that's not a practical case here.

837
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:42,000
But there are cases which are like this this is very straight right which means is not only confounding, but also sort of give you a wrong and opposite conclusion. Right?

838
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:54,000
If you don't consider great the association is positive if you consider great association exactly negative

839
02:13:54,000 --> 02:14:02,000
Okay, that's why I always watch for you know subpopulations structures and founders.

840
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:11,000
Because that make a huge impact. Oh, your final conclusion

841
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:23,000
Any question here

842
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:26,000
That's why Leonardo will talk about how do we analyze 3 or 4 or more variable.

843
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:33,000
All the gather right in one model. use module regression.

844
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:37,000
And this is the case where, you know, we could do some transformation. where to?

845
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:41,000
To make the data linear right? Originally the data may not be being here.

846
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:47,000
For example, this is the Gdp of a country versus the mortality rate of youth in our country.

847
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:54,000
With, You know. you know the curve is not. linear. Are there a whole bunch of country which low Gdp.

848
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:58,000
With various level locality rate, and the whole bunch of the country was very low.

849
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:04,000
How did it rate about this very level of gdp right So that's the nonlinear relationship.

850
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:16,000
If you measure the R is negative 0 point 4 which means they're negative, associated by you with the basis vicious of this number, because the nonlinear relationship is that if you make a transformation kick the log of both gdp

851
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:22,000
and mortality rate that's the data you see these are the more lenient.

852
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:30,000
Hi, and then the car is negative. 0 Point 8 8 is actually much stronger than it so which means the Pdp and the mortality rate.

853
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:38,000
They are indeed strongly negative associated, but on the log scale, not on our original scale.

854
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:55,000
How many interpretation is totally different i'm an in original scale you mean per unit increase in gdp per unit decrease in mortality rate, which is not the case here, because it's not in on the rock on the law scale which

855
02:15:55,000 --> 02:16:02,000
means that our unit increasing log Gdp per unit decreasing a lot more time in the way, and you didn't increasing long.

856
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:12,000
Gdp actually is when you are about to dp by a particular ratio right when you'll double your Gdp, your mortality rate draw by 2 hole.

857
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:20,000
That's what this speaker is saying

858
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:33,000
Okay, So if your data is not in your try to make it linear before you use this particular here's some correlation

859
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:47,000
I have a question here it's been while we are been taking the the up scale of the monthly to it on the Gdp I mean what we are we converting it into a

860
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:54,000
lot. Yeah. So because the original data is now linearly distributed, right?

861
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:57,000
You see there is a trend so the trend doesn't lie on the line.

862
02:16:57,000 --> 02:17:08,000
There's a curve and then here's some call if it doesn't deal with curves. Well, so though you can compute it. so it's hardly interpreted the number when the data, is not being what you know in

863
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:14,000
this particular case it turned out that, and in many case like this turns out taking the log and help you.

864
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:17,000
And the reason we have this car, because you know the country.

865
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:21,000
They have a wide range of Gdp Right they go from like Tdp.

866
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:25,000
Per capita. They go from $1,000 to like $20,000.

867
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:32,000
There's a wide range, and also in more power the way and the log will take care of the range.

868
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:39,000
The way to take longer. see the data. A much better behaved and things rocky. lie on a street line.

869
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:48,000
That's why we take law, which often works for this type of day. Well, you have to be careful Right? because you cannot take law for next negative numbers.

870
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:53,000
Right? Yeah. So on, so forth. So different kind of data require different kind of transformation.

871
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:58,000
A lot. Transformation is very part of it. Okay, Thank you.

872
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:02,000
We have a big range of your data. Sometimes you can try log transformation.

873
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:06,000
Which office stabilized right? If your data is not linear take it along.

874
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:12,000
You've got data. Have all liars take the log Sometimes it just help you stabilize the data not always.

875
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:20,000
But you know it's a very very widely used transformation

876
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:34,000
For example, if you'll measure like contamination for example, that contamination you saw, you, you see, most of the county has very low contamination, but some of the county has very high contamination like the data that may not normal the

877
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:38,000
relationship is probably not being here right in those cases. I take the law.

878
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:45,000
The data will look much better.

879
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:56,000
Any other question. Yeah, I do. But when you do this transformation the interpretation of the data, change it as well, Right?

880
02:18:56,000 --> 02:19:04,000
Can you explain how? Yes, So what you have a lie?

881
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:10,000
Our linear trend. The The patient always says unit increase in the X. variable.

882
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:17,000
There's some certain you know increase or decrease in the y variable fixed right.

883
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:20,000
That's what the what the line is right basically if you move on the X direction.

884
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:32,000
The Y direction move by a fixed amount. in the original scale that's per unit increase in Gdp right? but the last scale is per unit increasing logic.

885
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,000
If you increase log to Db. by one you're modified to Dv.

886
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:42,000
By 2. right? So basically, you know, shifting in a lot scale. It's like a multiplying, you know original scale.

887
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:56,000
That's why the you know they don't always change for those who are who are familiar with a lot right blocks are, you know, the the multiplicative scale into advocate scale so you know doing additional subdrapping on the large

888
02:19:56,000 --> 02:20:05,000
scale is equivalent to doing modification on the original scale.

889
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:14,000
Thank you.

890
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:23,000
Any other problem. Yes, I'm. i'm just having another question. So if we're converting it to the log scale, you're getting a result where the R is minus openated.

891
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:31,000
So the I mean. it's you know we's changing the entire the our coefficient, and so it's changing the interpretation.

892
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:36,000
So in this case. which one is more which one?

893
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:43,000
Which which of the interpretation should we follow like is more important, because it's changing the entire results right?

894
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:50,000
So in this case I will trust this more, not because the number is smaller.

895
02:20:50,000 --> 02:21:01,000
Well, because the data is more linear Remember pearson correlation is designed to model linear relationship here's some correlation is meaningless.

896
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:06,000
So this is not a representative summary of the data, but this one is so.

897
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:15,000
I will say yes on the log scale gdp and the in infantry. They are strongly negatively ported.

898
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:23,000
I I i'm i'm waiting to see that there could be caused by confounding that's another issue by least this Pearson correlation.

899
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:29,000
Apply on data. look like this it's more trustworthy on the left side.

900
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:40,000
You're welcome. Yeah, that's why always you know when you're calculating, Pearson correlation always do a scatter part of the data that'll see whether they look like good example rather thanatic.

901
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:45,000
Number. So you want your data look like this one, only this one.

902
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:53,000
The other 3 will be suspicious, although all 4 of them have the same corporation.

903
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:58,000
That's the payroll message

904
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:07,000
Any more question.

905
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:12,000
Yeah, there, you know, this lecture is long, because, like the 3 left or left, so take a little longer.

906
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:17,000
So I will take a break now, and continue in 10Â min.

907
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:27,000
Then hopefully, I can finish the lecture today. but if you if I don't finish that's fine because this exercise, and the quiz will be due on Wednesday.

908
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:33,000
Not tomorrow tomorrow, You're just trying the the project and quiz for electron 8.

909
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:38,000
These are for, for one thing, Alright, let's take a break for 10Â min and come back later.

910
02:22:38,000 --> 02:23:08,000
Thank you.

911
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:22,000
Is rocky. good question so tomorrow. Unfortunately i'm gonna Miss Class, because I have to do

912
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:31,000
I'm one of the doctoring faculty at the medical school and tomorrow's the day that they introduce us to the new class of

913
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:42,000
But i'll be able to watch. the transcript Once I watch the video after and then do the work and the I just wanted to give you a heads up.

914
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:48,000
Yeah. Thanks for letting us know, I think. who is the ta on board today.

915
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:52,000
Please take a note so that you know we will mark your absence of attendance.

916
02:25:52,000 --> 02:26:22,000
Thanks for that. No problem. Yeah. Notice: Thanks.

917
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:58,000
Okay last. Now, continue. So we are almost done with correlation.

918
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:02,000
But we can are really finished until we talk about this important thing.

919
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:16,000
We? you know everybody else. No, but I just want to repeat it, because it's go through the whole course of the course is correlation versus quotation right here by correlation with with most naturally mean this pearson

920
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:24,000
correlation will also mean generally association. Okay, because correlation just one way to measure the association.

921
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:29,000
So we all know all right, or doesn't how you imply causation.

922
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:37,000
But the fundamental reason was because compounding I'll have to keep 99, and think about the invitation.

923
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:44,000
I'm, i'm going to go over you know my example, and explain what I think, and then let's have some discussion, if you like.

924
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:46,000
So the first speaker was you know let's read it right?

925
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:54,000
X-axis is is pine. Why access is the cigarette smoke per person per year?

926
02:34:54,000 --> 02:35:00,000
I don't know there are 2 cards here these are 2 time course data.

927
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:15,000
The blue car or the cigarette consumption you meant, You see that from 1,995, the increase by about fourfold or more, and the the rest of the long hands are raised in man it's

928
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:27,000
not from 1920 to 90 70. The increase above like 5 phone under the 2 carbars sort of a parallel to each other, and then they. The difference is about 20 years.

929
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:31,000
So this is not a scalar path. like you'll take the cigarette consumption.

930
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:44,000
You man versus long cancer. you meant by 20 years later as a measurement that will see they are highly coordinated, positively recorded

931
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:51,000
Does that mean smoking is causing lung cancer after 20 years?

932
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:58,000
It's cool but just from this data alone it's not sufficient.

933
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:07,000
Alright, they're probably confining there could be anything going on in this 20 years, with all looking at those we cannot for the final conclusion.

934
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:14,000
Nevertheless, we know there are many pieces of evidence studying, smoking and lung cancer, and all of them point in the same direction.

935
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:22,000
Although like I said it's very hard to do an experimental study, if not possible, in human like, this for ethical reasons.

936
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:26,000
But nevertheless we can do experimental study in mouse Right?

937
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:40,000
I Then, because many piece of different study finally point to the same direction, and that leave us no no way, no other explanation done to throw the conclusion that smoking is causing lung.

938
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:44,000
Cancer. So this is a I would say 100% sure, about 99.9%. sure.

939
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:55,000
And people take it, and that, you know. But this whole thing took that case of study to draw our consensus and then move on to policy changes

940
02:36:55,000 --> 02:37:00,000
And the difficulty was again because of potential confounding we're missing. right?

941
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:07,000
So there's always a gap between observational data and the calls on inference.

942
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:12,000
If you have a question, please let me know, or you have any comment.

943
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:19,000
So essentially, you know from this data we just couldn't find other way, you know, there could be always be confounding right.

944
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:27,000
But we just don't come out with a compounder or a setup confounder that can explain the high correlation like this. right?

945
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:34,000
You need to figure out some variable which are both a social list smoking and a long time, and that is hard to come up with.

946
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:45,000
But people can think about you could have a gene which make you like to, you know, be be linked with the dictators also like it to get lung cancer.

947
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:51,000
That's possible. but that you need to be associated with both very strongly.

948
02:37:51,000 --> 02:38:01,000
And is this very unlikely, that we haven't find that gene Yet right? because we sort of an all all the 25,000 gene human genome, right?

949
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:03,000
So we have a pondogy. Yeah, there are jeans. definitely.

950
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:07,000
The soldier is, you know, nicotine, addiction, and also cancer.

951
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:14,000
But none of the Jin can explain association as strong as this one.

952
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:21,000
And second example is priority climate change right so it's again.

953
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:25,000
Time course data this time not even a delay. The blue one are C. O.

954
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:29,000
2, I mean, I guess, or Co. 2 amount in in the atmosphere.

955
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:36,000
I Don't know which but it's just co 2 and the red one is temperature right overall average type of you have to, you know.

956
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:39,000
Go back to the video. How do they really define global temperature?

957
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:45,000
Right have to measure hundreds different size, no control for many different things like herbalization and other things.

958
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:55,000
But nevertheless. Suppose, you finally summarize co 2 and temperature 2 variable primaryial party is very it's morotic right oxidating a lot.

959
02:38:55,000 --> 02:39:13,000
But if you'll take the moving average you see this 2 correlated pretty well across the time here to be from 80, 50 to 2,010, that's 160 years, So these are the high. correlation But the Zami C o 2

960
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:18,000
will cause global temperature to raise

961
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:32,000
It's not to be possible, but again. this is the original deal. We cannot do experiment on Earth, and we don't have like a 50 planets to randomize into 2 groups.

962
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:40,000
So there are always a potential component by the team. The the thing is, I mentioned a piece of evidence.

963
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:47,000
Many study points in the same direction and a strong correlation, and we have yet to pig out the founder which can explain this.

964
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:55,000
For example, people know like there's sun activity by their you know geological sort of activity.

965
02:39:55,000 --> 02:40:02,000
First can can change its package just by itself. Right? It happened many times in history, right?

966
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:11,000
Any of those can change time rates, but the thing is usually they change on a much larger scale, like hundreds, if not thousands, of years, not on this short scale.

967
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:16,000
A second is that it's hard to believe how come the sun activity.

968
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:25,000
We'll card it with human activity. there's no reason for those would be harder alright.

969
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:34,000
So basically it's possible there could be something we haven't thought about you just unlike you right after all this study all point the same direction.

970
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:36,000
We haven't yet to pick out the explanation what confounded.

971
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:46,000
It could be to make this noncon so that's Why, more and more people, The normal scientist would be deep human, are causing this.

972
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:51,000
But there is just this guy right of observational study of correlation.

973
02:40:51,000 --> 02:41:02,000
There. people can always argue maybe you're missing something right, and you cannot rule that all for sure, because, after all, you cannot randomize.

974
02:41:02,000 --> 02:41:08,000
You can not run the randomized trial on this

975
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:17,000
Any common question here

976
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:22,000
Oh, partly, i'm only taking all of this from the physical point of view. right?

977
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:27,000
If you ask the people who work on this 2 problems, they have a lot more arguments.

978
02:41:27,000 --> 02:41:30,000
I want me the other, for example, there are physicians.

979
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:33,000
There are, you know, like a climb assigned this right?

980
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:39,000
They have all the piece of that office. for example, you cannot run trial on Earth, but they do run trial on smaller environment.

981
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:45,000
In a in a library level the Barbara right where they can really study the relationship between Co.

982
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:48,000
2 a great house and other things right. but people always are.

983
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:50,000
Arguing on the earth is not a simple black right?

984
02:41:50,000 --> 02:42:01,000
What you study in mouse may not apply on human what you're studying. the lab may not apply on the global. but nevertheless, all this piece of evidence, right observational, versus experimental.

985
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:10,000
They all point the same direction. So every single publication, every single piece, real strength, and that be that is true.

986
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:22,000
So if I know me I claim i'm an expert on any of this problem, I'm only looking at an angle from a statistical point of view.

987
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:32,000
Any question common

988
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:41,000
Okay, Now, you know we are, and entering a realm of you know some from jokes that's personal kind of bottom platform.

989
02:42:41,000 --> 02:42:47,000
This is actually a from a real paper on you. you will have a journal of journalism.

990
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:51,000
Oh, is it supposed to be a joke? but it's part of a serious job?

991
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:58,000
And now they what a good thought is you know it's too small to see

992
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:04,000
Well, I remember them. The title of this is that you know chocolate a Socialist intelligence, or something like that.

993
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:11,000
So what's happening is that so that access is chocolate consumption per capita in each different country?

994
02:43:11,000 --> 02:43:18,000
You see that Switzerland has the most, and the Germany second, and so on, and so forth.

995
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:24,000
On the Y-axis are nobel laureate per per capita.

996
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:44,000
And then you you can read r equals 0. point 7 9 so it's almost point. 8 correlation, and then, furthermore, the pivot is less than point 0 0 0 one You see this correlation and strongly and significant, another

997
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:52,000
question. I mean they're also evidence showing chocolate will in fact, you know, impact brain activity, right?

998
02:43:52,000 --> 02:44:00,000
Maybe some arguably moderate evidence supporting talk to make you smarter or have to be still brain work better.

999
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:05,000
So all these pickup please have this, but that has anything to do with, you know.

1000
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:16,000
Really the speaker, i'll apparently you can think about confounders like all this country are high in both their developed countries.

1001
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:22,000
All the 100 down here, you know. Not all. but many of them are developing countries. right?

1002
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:30,000
So a priority, economic education, infrastructure, many other things could be confounding right.

1003
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:35,000
So we definitely cannot draw the conclusion. Talk to make it smaller whatsoever.

1004
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:45,000
But bottom line is that this is observational data

1005
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:52,000
And then this one is even worse. This is a case where you need to be more careful with people.

1006
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:55,000
We'll make it plot we talk about this on the first week right?

1007
02:44:55,000 --> 02:45:00,000
Some way of making that false. Remember don't start from 0 or flip your access right.

1008
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:06,000
And this figure did both. The access has a number of pirates approximately in the world.

1009
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:13,000
The wire access of the global temperature. You see that they are all seen crazy.

1010
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:18,000
The temperature has nothing wrong. it's just a global temperature we know it's increasing.

1011
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:21,000
But the number of Paris. You see how the access is really straight, right?

1012
02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:28,000
They go from 35,000 to 55,000 to 20,000 to 15,000.

1013
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:32,000
So the first goes. Often we could code up it's not an eco-grid.

1014
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:48,000
It's not one direction. They just arbitrary put the data. there will make it look like, okay, Alright, So always be careful how you'll make the path

1015
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:55,000
And then this the second one this time they are not really private sheet, or with the debt.

1016
02:45:55,000 --> 02:45:58,000
Is that the green curves are Internet explorer market share.

1017
02:45:58,000 --> 02:46:03,000
We know that, you know Internet Bar is not doing well for those of you.

1018
02:46:03,000 --> 02:46:11,000
Still remember what Internet Bar is. Oh, he's a microsoft developer, and the Y-axis are the murders in us.

1019
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:17,000
These are time for that. This is real data. Ivd: You see that they are strongly already.

1020
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:23,000
So across this time period 15 years, both drops significant

1021
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:38,000
But do they have anything to do with each other? I thought right So to make anything like we call, or you need to have a underlying mechanism like

1022
02:46:38,000 --> 02:46:45,000
This is probably just globalization, you know, Internet getting popular, right?

1023
02:46:45,000 --> 02:46:52,000
There. More people stay at home whatever using computer using Google brother.

1024
02:46:52,000 --> 02:46:57,000
And then there are a few of people you know I don't know there could be many, many confounding there, so there could be.

1025
02:46:57,000 --> 02:47:02,000
There are like a 1,000 different variable that change during this 15 years.

1026
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:06,000
Alright. this 2 variable may not, may not have anything to do each other.

1027
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:33,000
So a textbook example of confounding which is not showing here. if you'll measure ice cream consumption per month versus she's drowning number of kids drawing per month. They are highly correlated well, you got you needed to tell that the compounding

1028
02:47:33,000 --> 02:47:36,000
is how very true! Right in summer there are more ice cream consumption.

1029
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:41,000
There are more people swimming there for more people drawing.

1030
02:47:41,000 --> 02:47:47,000
So just because 2 guys are part of It doesn't mean there's anything calls between them.

1031
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:53,000
They could have nothing to do each other like this, or there could be a simple confounder underline.

1032
02:47:53,000 --> 02:47:58,000
So a final conclusion. bigger is this cartoon from XkCD.

1033
02:47:58,000 --> 02:48:03,000
The boys that I used to think correlations in high positions.

1034
02:48:03,000 --> 02:48:08,000
Then that took us the the cost Now I don't and the girls.

1035
02:48:08,000 --> 02:48:19,000
That sounds like the cause. help the boyfriend. Well, maybe because again, this is an observational data with assembly.

1036
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:24,000
As a one. You cannot draw the conclusion out of this.

1037
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:27,000
Okay, if you really do that statistics that's the way you think about this job.

1038
02:48:27,000 --> 02:48:55,000
But yeah, not everybody thinks specifically alright so that's how I want to say about correlation any part before I move on to linear regression

1039
02:48:55,000 --> 02:49:12,000
Okay, Dr. Jan, I I have a question. If I have our number very, very close to one online is one.

1040
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:17,000
Can I tell that my p-value will be also extremely significant?

1041
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:29,000
There is a relationship between do Everything else you call the The bigger the magnitude costs, the more evidence like in the end.

1042
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:35,000
Your case of evidence is the ratio between R and the standard arrow and the standard era has our unit.

1043
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:41,000
Well, also the sample size, so you can then take a extreme example.

1044
02:49:41,000 --> 02:49:49,000
You cannot even compute the p vio if n equals 2 because this will be 0, and that's cause he's even 2 data points.

1045
02:49:49,000 --> 02:49:55,000
Then the cord is always one or minus one. right? So you have 3 data points.

1046
02:49:55,000 --> 02:50:01,000
This will be so big that qvido may not be so it's not dependent on the sample time.

1047
02:50:01,000 --> 02:50:04,000
Everything else equal, the more extreme. The r is the the more likely you have a small P.

1048
02:50:04,000 --> 02:50:23,000
Right, you're welcome and the other questions

1049
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:30,000
Okay, So the same data Now, a different analysis, right? Remember, the correlation is good.

1050
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:34,000
You can run about happening and run. confident in the vote.

1051
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:41,000
You can do anything. Well, what correlation doesn't tell you is that correlation?

1052
02:50:41,000 --> 02:50:49,000
Treat the 2 variable in. see my tricky hard if it doesn't care which one is the exponential between.

1053
02:50:49,000 --> 02:50:53,000
But sometimes we care, and also for the more correlation.

1054
02:50:53,000 --> 02:51:01,000
You can only do harder with 2 garbage but sometimes we need a 3 or more variables, and call it and color couldn't.

1055
02:51:01,000 --> 02:51:14,000
Handle that. So now we enter, so called the regression. So we first talk about simple linear regression, which also deal with codarables, which is a alternative to partish and highly related.

1056
02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:17,000
But the The linear greeting is nice because you can extend to multiple in your regret.

1057
02:51:17,000 --> 02:51:25,000
Where you can do with multiple variables and that's what we're really hiding for the next lecture.

1058
02:51:25,000 --> 02:51:28,000
Okay, first of all the same data Here we see there's a strong part.

1059
02:51:28,000 --> 02:51:36,000
They try. and so on so forth, suppose i'm gonna take the act as a exposure, and wired outcome, and we almost always do that.

1060
02:51:36,000 --> 02:51:41,000
So if you're exposure and the y-axis, please flip your fear.

1061
02:51:41,000 --> 02:51:46,000
Okay, we just configure it's put on the access phone.

1062
02:51:46,000 --> 02:51:53,000
So now, because it's linear we want to use the linear to model the trend I use linear to make interpretation and make conclusion.

1063
02:51:53,000 --> 02:51:58,000
So we want to draw a linear align. Go through the data as close as possible.

1064
02:51:58,000 --> 02:52:05,000
Where should we draw the line? And there are many? We can draw the line.

1065
02:52:05,000 --> 02:52:08,000
Trust me, i'll i'll explain later but one line which is especially popular.

1066
02:52:08,000 --> 02:52:17,000
It's called a linear regression line the this one this is not a you know.

1067
02:52:17,000 --> 02:52:21,000
Handy line. This is the line, the linear regression line.

1068
02:52:21,000 --> 02:52:28,000
We say this line with the data that under this model, So what do you mean by path? right?

1069
02:52:28,000 --> 02:52:45,000
Each one has a criteria i'll talk about that so we know a line can be expressed in the linear equation right, Some constant alpha plus beta times act

1070
02:52:45,000 --> 02:52:48,000
So the constant alpha would call the intersect.

1071
02:52:48,000 --> 02:53:05,000
The Beta would call the flow we'll explain why, by essentially, alpha is the location where the line intersect the y-axis at the place where X is 0 and the beta is the slow basically how deep the line

1072
02:53:05,000 --> 02:53:08,000
is.

1073
02:53:08,000 --> 02:53:11,000
So give the line for any hacks we can find.

1074
02:53:11,000 --> 02:53:18,000
The corresponding y value that's the predictive value of one

1075
02:53:18,000 --> 02:53:23,000
So we, because the data is random. We do not expect the line to perfectly go through all the data point.

1076
02:53:23,000 --> 02:53:29,000
We just want the line to approximate it. Go through most of the data points as close as possible.

1077
02:53:29,000 --> 02:53:32,000
Right, but you can have a perfect go through the data point.

1078
02:53:32,000 --> 02:53:42,000
So in the end there's an error let me call you the random arrow here use e to denote it.

1079
02:53:42,000 --> 02:53:45,000
Actually, you know, in the more rigorous book people use it.

1080
02:53:45,000 --> 02:53:47,000
So a Greek ladder but that's Peter you'll see.

1081
02:53:47,000 --> 02:53:51,000
So the line is y equals alpha plus beta x.

1082
02:53:51,000 --> 02:54:00,000
Well the real model or the data, these models. My life was alpha plus beta x plus d

1083
02:54:00,000 --> 02:54:06,000
But he exists in the random observation but it's not a quantitative nature.

1084
02:54:06,000 --> 02:54:13,000
So the key now is that given the data, if we have accent, why can we figure out what Alpha beta is?

1085
02:54:13,000 --> 02:54:31,000
Can we find a lot? and the answer is Yes, so first we need to define what is a good line by the the good line will go through the data as close as possible.

1086
02:54:31,000 --> 02:54:36,000
I'll do a measure of closeness so it's a line, and these are the data points.

1087
02:54:36,000 --> 02:54:45,000
What we do is that we project that they each day the point vertically to the line.

1088
02:54:45,000 --> 02:54:48,000
Yeah, vertically, because the Y-axis is the outcome.

1089
02:54:48,000 --> 02:54:52,000
We want to reduce the error in the prediction.

1090
02:54:52,000 --> 02:54:56,000
So if you project each State deployment we're gonna go through the line, and then you can imagine the distance.

1091
02:54:56,000 --> 02:55:05,000
So you could use. Xi Yi. We project to the line the distance you call the Ei ei is zoom.

1092
02:55:05,000 --> 02:55:15,000
You Y minus y I hat. Why is that observed the why why I have is the predicted Why, by the line why I had this a plus b xi.

1093
02:55:15,000 --> 02:55:22,000
So here I'm. using Alpha and beta but the alphabet has a population from the one who has been made, and A and A.

1094
02:55:22,000 --> 02:55:32,000
B are the one we really estimate upon the data. So, plugging the data, using our algorithm and talk about later on, we can actually get A and B which supposedly should estimate help.

1095
02:55:32,000 --> 02:55:36,000
And the data. So am I. I realized the version of Alpha Beta.

1096
02:55:36,000 --> 02:55:41,000
So last week got a on the B. we got a line a plus bxi, and then plug in any Xi.

1097
02:55:41,000 --> 02:55:47,000
We will get the Yi hat. We try to predict Why, I we all have observed the wire.

1098
02:55:47,000 --> 02:55:49,000
The way we can take the difference. Why, I minus y I had.

1099
02:55:49,000 --> 02:55:56,000
We call it e, I have, which is the at the mer estimated version of er.

1100
02:55:56,000 --> 02:56:03,000
So what we want is the line to be as close to the all the data points as possible.

1101
02:56:03,000 --> 02:56:17,000
You're close as much by defined as a smaller value of er I want all of them to be small, so we use the same tree because some of the Ei will be positive that's for the points lie above the line some of

1102
02:56:17,000 --> 02:56:25,000
the yeah, will be negative that's for the points like the lower line, while all of them to be small the magnitude for your absolute value.

1103
02:56:25,000 --> 02:56:31,000
So we have the same trick we square on a yeah, and then add them.

1104
02:56:31,000 --> 02:56:36,000
Add them all together

1105
02:56:36,000 --> 02:56:44,000
So ei path is called a residual, which is the estimate of the error ei, which is assigned for you.

1106
02:56:44,000 --> 02:56:49,000
You use the line to predict, and then there's a part you cannot predict, you know.

1107
02:56:49,000 --> 02:56:57,000
Observe the data that's part of the region right so when you'll square the residue are you add them together.

1108
02:56:57,000 --> 02:57:01,000
That's called the sum of this sum of squares of the region.

1109
02:57:01,000 --> 02:57:05,000
Oh, for sure sum of squares of error! right?

1110
02:57:05,000 --> 02:57:09,000
So you want to minimize the sum of square of the Dr.

1111
02:57:09,000 --> 02:57:12,000
For your reality. We also take the average of the sum of the Ei.

1112
02:57:12,000 --> 02:57:16,000
So, some of them divided by the sample size, but here, minus 2.

1113
02:57:16,000 --> 02:57:22,000
For the same reason to follow up earlier, because when we asked me the model, use 2 parameters, so we lose 2 degree of freedom.

1114
02:57:22,000 --> 02:57:25,000
So essentially, we take the average of the residual square.

1115
02:57:25,000 --> 02:57:31,000
We card Am I see the mean square error? So this is the mean, square error.

1116
02:57:31,000 --> 02:57:34,000
If you say sum square error, that will be s se.

1117
02:57:34,000 --> 02:57:38,000
But this is the mean square era, which is, you know, average the version.

1118
02:57:38,000 --> 02:57:43,000
So either you want to minimize the sum of square error or you want to minimize the mean square error.

1119
02:57:43,000 --> 02:57:51,000
That's the same thing that will give you the same law. So you want to find, hey?

1120
02:57:51,000 --> 02:57:54,000
And the B, so that this mean square error is minimal.

1121
02:57:54,000 --> 02:58:05,000
Give it a data, and then, if you take a regression course they will tell you how to derive the formula right here, I'll just list the formula here.

1122
02:58:05,000 --> 02:58:11,000
It turns out that Amd can be calculated this way

1123
02:58:11,000 --> 02:58:22,000
So a will be Y Bar minus dx bar here. Why, by X bar, remember, are the average oh, x and y other sample mean in the 2 variables.

1124
02:58:22,000 --> 02:58:26,000
Exposure Variable X. and the outcome level one a B.

1125
02:58:26,000 --> 02:58:28,000
Will be Sxy, which is the covariance of V.

1126
02:58:28,000 --> 02:58:36,000
Twox and Y. and Sx square, which is a various sample variance of X itself.

1127
02:58:36,000 --> 02:58:40,000
So plug using a will be you using both X and Y.

1128
02:58:40,000 --> 02:58:46,000
The data. You can compute things on the right side. Your first computer B: Then USB: you compute A.

1129
02:58:46,000 --> 02:58:49,000
Then you gotta both say, let me. So you got a unique answer.

1130
02:58:49,000 --> 02:59:03,000
Once you got the data, and that give you the best line that's feeding law. and this matter is called the least square, least squares, because that minimize the sum of squares of all the error.

1131
02:59:03,000 --> 02:59:10,000
This is about the least square regression

1132
02:59:10,000 --> 02:59:21,000
Again you don't have to remember the formula I don't but just know there's a problem to get along

1133
02:59:21,000 --> 02:59:33,000
And the formula will be so complicated in the multiple regression. case because then we'll have more than 2 variable The formula can only be written, you know it can be written on this way, but it's better written, in matrix form which I

1134
02:59:33,000 --> 02:59:38,000
won't be showing you'll be learning if you take a real, you know more in that little course on linear regression.

1135
02:59:38,000 --> 02:59:46,000
But there is a formula that's what's important

1136
02:59:46,000 --> 02:59:59,000
Okay, So in particular, for this data set. when we plug in the data, we got a equals, 1, 1.0 0 and P equals 0 point 3, 2.

1137
02:59:59,000 --> 03:00:06,000
That's the number we got and using this paradigm we draw a line that's the live account

1138
03:00:06,000 --> 03:00:12,000
So a goal is not to do the calculation because the software will do it for us, but rather to interpret the results Right?

1139
03:00:12,000 --> 03:00:23,000
What does A and B mean?

1140
03:00:23,000 --> 03:00:28,000
So let's look at what what does amb mean remember the principal.

1141
03:00:28,000 --> 03:00:34,000
Why I have is given by a plus bxr. What do you have outside and A and B.

1142
03:00:34,000 --> 03:00:40,000
You can plug in to get prediction for any single one in particular case.

1143
03:00:40,000 --> 03:00:54,000
So suppose there is a State with 40% residents only power on basically Xi equals 0 point equals 40, and the plot A and B A plus B Xi. We got the Y.

1144
03:00:54,000 --> 03:01:10,000
I have the predicted Y by the line 13.9, which means that our model will expect the number for 100. The final on suicide in mail is 13.8

1145
03:01:10,000 --> 03:01:15,000
The question is this a good afternoon? You have to look at a figure right?

1146
03:01:15,000 --> 03:01:25,000
40 is here. It's in the middle it's about the average, and there are many States having roughly 40% by on ownership. On this.

1147
03:01:25,000 --> 03:01:30,000
Otherwise is Saturday. Their every

1148
03:01:30,000 --> 03:01:40,000
In that sense, you know, you could see it is not a very good estimate, because you see it for space with about 40% far on ownership.

1149
03:01:40,000 --> 03:01:48,000
The surrounding States. right nearby states there suicide rate range from 10% up to 25%.

1150
03:01:48,000 --> 03:01:54,000
So varied is 30.9. Oh, really, you have a big variability.

1151
03:01:54,000 --> 03:02:02,000
So this estimate is not perfect. But, on the other hand, you could say the average is not so bad, because we have a lot of space.

1152
03:02:02,000 --> 03:02:06,000
Having this particular, you know, 40% far ownership way.

1153
03:02:06,000 --> 03:02:13,000
So we have a big data. we'll make this guess right we have a lot of information.

1154
03:02:13,000 --> 03:02:22,000
So you using this gas? We cannot know each specific state. Well, we can get it average pretty well.

1155
03:02:22,000 --> 03:02:28,000
So. It is not a very good estimate for a particular state, but it is a very good estimate for the average of all those days.

1156
03:02:28,000 --> 03:02:39,000
Having this property

1157
03:02:39,000 --> 03:02:49,000
Again. You have a question. Just simply let me know

1158
03:02:49,000 --> 03:02:54,000
So the regional line is not perfect, Right? Some stays all right close to the line.

1159
03:02:54,000 --> 03:02:57,000
Some States are far away through the line. Well, stays are close to the line.

1160
03:02:57,000 --> 03:03:05,000
Your prediction based on the line will be very good, for states are far away from the line, for prediction will be all right.

1161
03:03:05,000 --> 03:03:17,000
Some States are far away from the line. So for states like the lower line, your prediction will be over estimate, because the line predicts something better higher than their true outcome.

1162
03:03:17,000 --> 03:03:28,000
For space above the line. Your prediction will be under admin That's just the nature you are predicting the average behavior of a State, not in each individual.

1163
03:03:28,000 --> 03:03:39,000
One.

1164
03:03:39,000 --> 03:03:47,000
It turns out that, you know, because the same data, even though correlation and linear regression, they do not do the same study.

1165
03:03:47,000 --> 03:03:53,000
They are very much related. Remember B equals X S. x Y.

1166
03:03:53,000 --> 03:03:57,000
Over Sx Square. Remember the question. different. Caller: efficient.

1167
03:03:57,000 --> 03:04:06,000
Are you, Sxy? right? by the definition? This r is the metric in X and y is being not symmetric in the sense.

1168
03:04:06,000 --> 03:04:14,000
If you swap acting, why, the hard will not change, but the B will change, but nevertheless they are very much related.

1169
03:04:14,000 --> 03:04:17,000
For example, you can figure out P equals R. Times, Sy.

1170
03:04:17,000 --> 03:04:24,000
Over Sx for B. and R. They are very much related.

1171
03:04:24,000 --> 03:04:32,000
They just have different purpose. R. is designed to be unitless so it doesn't care about the unit of measurement for both X and Y.

1172
03:04:32,000 --> 03:04:43,000
But B has a unit in them, because B, as well talk about later, explains the relationship between X and Y using accessible exposure to pretty big one.

1173
03:04:43,000 --> 03:04:49,000
So this asymmetric, and has a practical meeting

1174
03:04:49,000 --> 03:04:57,000
Okay, R. Doesn't have a practical meeting. or just explain the relationship, the strength of the real issue.

1175
03:04:57,000 --> 03:05:00,000
So you think this formula B equals R. times sy over. Sx.

1176
03:05:00,000 --> 03:05:10,000
You can figure out first of all, B and R. must have the same sign, because most assets and Asy they are standard deviation, and they've always called it so B equals R.

1177
03:05:10,000 --> 03:05:13,000
Times a positive number, which means B and R are the same sign.

1178
03:05:13,000 --> 03:05:20,000
If correlation is negative, and the soap is negative you've correlated, it's probably gonna solve this problem.

1179
03:05:20,000 --> 03:05:25,000
The flow always, you know, go along the same direction as the correlation.

1180
03:05:25,000 --> 03:05:31,000
Similarly, if R is 0, then B must be 0. If the x and y are not correlated.

1181
03:05:31,000 --> 03:05:39,000
Another regression line will be flat. the slope will be 0

1182
03:05:39,000 --> 03:05:46,000
Nevertheless, or do not equal to B, you know, because R.

1183
03:05:46,000 --> 03:05:49,000
Is a unit list are always ran from 0 minus one to one.

1184
03:05:49,000 --> 03:05:53,000
But B. can write from minus infinity to positive infinity. So R. and V.

1185
03:05:53,000 --> 03:06:01,000
Are ready by this ratio as well as X, for example, this 2 particular linear regression model.

1186
03:06:01,000 --> 03:06:06,000
They both have the same slope, but they have different correlation.

1187
03:06:06,000 --> 03:06:10,000
The first one has a much stronger product; on the second one similar.

1188
03:06:10,000 --> 03:06:13,000
There are cases where you have the same correlation, but you have different slope.

1189
03:06:13,000 --> 03:06:16,000
You can think about what will make that happen. So R. and the B.

1190
03:06:16,000 --> 03:06:25,000
Are not one for one corresponding to each other, yet they are highly related

1191
03:06:25,000 --> 03:06:33,000
Because they have different interpretation

1192
03:06:33,000 --> 03:06:38,000
Okay, So the slope only measure the angle of the line.

1193
03:06:38,000 --> 03:06:45,000
Right relative to the flat line or is on the line.

1194
03:06:45,000 --> 03:06:50,000
Other correlation also measured. Paul concentrated the points around this line.

1195
03:06:50,000 --> 03:06:54,000
So they are measuring different things. The slope doesn't care how calls are you?

1196
03:06:54,000 --> 03:07:07,000
The point are wrong. Well, the correlation also doesn't care about the angle, the line is

1197
03:07:07,000 --> 03:07:09,000
Just like our can be used for uniforms. B.

1198
03:07:09,000 --> 03:07:17,000
Can also be used by your parents. Remember, B is the sample estimate for the population.

1199
03:07:17,000 --> 03:07:25,000
Parameter beta. The Beta is the true slope for the population

1200
03:07:25,000 --> 03:07:32,000
So we can form a normal office page now. states, Hey, that was 0 and haste.

1201
03:07:32,000 --> 03:07:40,000
Say it not equal to 0. We can test this knowledge of this, using a one sample cast, and the way is to figure out the standard arrow of the P.

1202
03:07:40,000 --> 03:07:47,000
Because we got a that would be already right so what's the standard ever to be horizontal standard Arab to be equals.

1203
03:07:47,000 --> 03:07:50,000
The square root of the mean square arrow versus assets.

1204
03:07:50,000 --> 03:07:55,000
All of this can be computed. Remember the mean square error.

1205
03:07:55,000 --> 03:08:00,000
Is this right? When you have A and B. you can compute E.

1206
03:08:00,000 --> 03:08:04,000
When you have e e hat you can compute. This means square error.

1207
03:08:04,000 --> 03:08:08,000
That you can compute the standard arrow A. B.

1208
03:08:08,000 --> 03:08:15,000
Once you have the standing here of the B, you kind of form a statistic you speed divided by the standard Arab, the B.

1209
03:08:15,000 --> 03:08:19,000
Or you can construct how the universe will be for beta, which is b plus minus 2.

1210
03:08:19,000 --> 03:08:24,000
To understand Arb

1211
03:08:24,000 --> 03:08:28,000
So the first one again will be a key statistic then we've got a P.

1212
03:08:28,000 --> 03:08:38,000
Value. In this particular case the standard arrow B equals 0 point 0 3, and the B equals 0 point.

1213
03:08:38,000 --> 03:08:42,000
What? 4, 9, 0 point, 3, 2, 0 0 point, 3, 2 is the B.

1214
03:08:42,000 --> 03:08:50,000
So you divide by that, you guys, you got ratio, the signal to noise, ratio or the T statistic equals 10.8, 2.

1215
03:08:50,000 --> 03:08:54,000
Which again, this is a piece that is there, for the pivot is highest in this number.

1216
03:08:54,000 --> 03:09:02,000
This number you may seem familiar, you can still recall. Let me pass the R.

1217
03:09:02,000 --> 03:09:11,000
Correlation.

1218
03:09:11,000 --> 03:09:18,000
We also got a P. value of 0 point 8 2 this is a totally different formula.

1219
03:09:18,000 --> 03:09:31,000
It's R. divided by the standard arrow bar looking back death and this 10.8, 2

1220
03:09:31,000 --> 03:09:35,000
This time point A 2 is B divided by standard arrow.

1221
03:09:35,000 --> 03:09:42,000
B. How totally different formula. Well, they're viral identical, And we are not just being lucky.

1222
03:09:42,000 --> 03:09:47,000
They will always identify. It turns out this 2 format, or in the end are the same.

1223
03:09:47,000 --> 03:09:53,000
After all, they are both teeth that they and now have others. beta equals 0.

1224
03:09:53,000 --> 03:09:59,000
Remember when R. is 0, B will be 0. They are not the same, but they are highly related.

1225
03:09:59,000 --> 03:10:06,000
So testing whether the role the population row is 0 or not is the same as having whether the beta is not 0.

1226
03:10:06,000 --> 03:10:21,000
Now. So, therefore, we are essentially taking the same number that's no surprising from very different formula would hand out with the same number and same key value.

1227
03:10:21,000 --> 03:10:33,000
So there are no correlation, and the regression they're not the same thing, but they're also very highly pretty late

1228
03:10:33,000 --> 03:10:36,000
But because the B itself is not bar right. So Beta is not role.

1229
03:10:36,000 --> 03:10:47,000
So the 95% common number for Beta is also not the same interval for that, for for the role here is 0 point, 5, 2 plus minus 2 times that error equals this.

1230
03:10:47,000 --> 03:10:50,000
We see that interval does not include 0. Therefore, Pv.

1231
03:10:50,000 --> 03:10:58,000
Is highly significant. Right? So which means that which means that this data side is random, right?

1232
03:10:58,000 --> 03:11:02,000
Next time you got a different data set, the lie will change a little bit.

1233
03:11:02,000 --> 03:11:05,000
The slope is sort of a runner, but not the last.

1234
03:11:05,000 --> 03:11:08,000
We know the true slope lie in this interval is high.

1235
03:11:08,000 --> 03:11:27,000
Yes, very likely the 2 slope is

1236
03:11:27,000 --> 03:11:34,000
Any question.

1237
03:11:34,000 --> 03:11:41,000
I know today it's like lecture that sorry hard to a little bit hiring.

1238
03:11:41,000 --> 03:11:49,000
But hope tomorrow you're. gonna work on the project right because today we probably don't have enough time to work on, but you have time to work on the project, but we don't have time to review them.

1239
03:11:49,000 --> 03:11:54,000
So it's better that we do it so tomorrow, so there are 2 more slides.

1240
03:11:54,000 --> 03:11:57,000
I will finish, and I will probably end today a little already.

1241
03:11:57,000 --> 03:12:02,000
Hopefully. So all this formula are sort of a messy.

1242
03:12:02,000 --> 03:12:09,000
And then this just was same, only in regression when you have only one exposure right? but multiple in your virtual, Probably later I will have one on one x.

1243
03:12:09,000 --> 03:12:13,000
It'll be even more. you know the the power will be even more complicated.

1244
03:12:13,000 --> 03:12:19,000
So i'm not gonna even invite them all So nevertheless, the tool software always can do it for you.

1245
03:12:19,000 --> 03:12:32,000
So what you need to recognize is that we'll have the data act on what you're running your aggression linear regression will spread out a table, and several number like this can I explain.

1246
03:12:32,000 --> 03:12:39,000
So the payment right now is 2 row, because we have Alpha and the beta slope interception slope. right?

1247
03:12:39,000 --> 03:12:44,000
So in the sub, usually just called intersect. the slope is not on the slope.

1248
03:12:44,000 --> 03:12:49,000
The slope usually use the name of the X variable, which is for generalization.

1249
03:12:49,000 --> 03:13:01,000
Leaving our When we run along the regression we have multiple slopes, so each one has a name according to their variable represented, and then usually there are several columns that these 4 are most widely used.

1250
03:13:01,000 --> 03:13:04,000
The activate means to estimate for the parameter right?

1251
03:13:04,000 --> 03:13:10,000
So this is A. This is B you're gonna take a note, you know. this is time to take a note.

1252
03:13:10,000 --> 03:13:15,000
This is B from the software. This is a standard arrow for the A.

1253
03:13:15,000 --> 03:13:20,000
This is a standard arrow for the B so using the Fd. made divided by standard arrow.

1254
03:13:20,000 --> 03:13:26,000
You've got a p statistical key or t value or just key.

1255
03:13:26,000 --> 03:13:37,000
So in this case, 0 point 7, 8, and 10.8 2, and follow at least the this thing when you're gonna pivot and this one is the significant because of his statistic between minus 2 and 2.

1256
03:13:37,000 --> 03:13:40,000
This one is highest significant, because this one is about 2.

1257
03:13:40,000 --> 03:13:48,000
So in fact, we can actually test both variable right. This is the pivot happy, having an all about saying the inter 7 equals 0.

1258
03:13:48,000 --> 03:13:56,000
This is pivotal for slope at 0 typically we don't care about this pivot because we rarely test about the intercept being 0.

1259
03:13:56,000 --> 03:14:03,000
Now, because their interests are being 0 doesn't have us specific meaning usual.

1260
03:14:03,000 --> 03:14:10,000
However, we do care whether the slope is 0 now. So this key value is a major interest because of the slope is 0.

1261
03:14:10,000 --> 03:14:20,000
That means X that's not associated with one the slope is not 0, which means actually is a social as well.

1262
03:14:20,000 --> 03:14:23,000
And then there are a few other numbers usually spit out by the software.

1263
03:14:23,000 --> 03:14:28,000
Sometimes a lot more. You can run different digital software but done in this case mean square error.

1264
03:14:28,000 --> 03:14:32,000
You can get It's not a remember mean square error right something called R.

1265
03:14:32,000 --> 03:14:39,000
Squared. The r squared is a number always between minus one and one.

1266
03:14:39,000 --> 03:14:47,000
It is not surprising, We say, are this r is the peers and correlation coefficient, even though this is a upper case.

1267
03:14:47,000 --> 03:14:53,000
That's a lower case it's the same thing so when you square, the peers and color collation coefficient.

1268
03:14:53,000 --> 03:15:02,000
Remember the r rate from minus one to one well squared. you got from 0 to one, and that's what the r squared here.

1269
03:15:02,000 --> 03:15:17,000
So the arts were always live between minus one. The one tells you how good the model fit the data essentially how much variation is explained by the regression model.

1270
03:15:17,000 --> 03:15:24,000
So if R squared is one means all the data points lie on the line regression line, which means the regression line. perfectly.

1271
03:15:24,000 --> 03:15:28,000
Explain all the barriers in the data that's our sport was one.

1272
03:15:28,000 --> 03:15:35,000
If our square means 0, which means the line regression lines flat, which means the regression line doesn't help you please explain the variation.

1273
03:15:35,000 --> 03:15:40,000
You? why at all. So he's playing 0% ofaration.

1274
03:15:40,000 --> 03:15:50,000
So the Rat R. tell you the Proportion variation is made by the model that's called R Square, also called the coefficient of determination.

1275
03:15:50,000 --> 03:15:52,000
So with it. How are you? which model fit the data better? Right?

1276
03:15:52,000 --> 03:15:57,000
The higher R squared states. the model fit the data a little better than the model is lower as well.

1277
03:15:57,000 --> 03:16:00,000
We'll look at this later. There are many way to compare models.

1278
03:16:00,000 --> 03:16:03,000
But this is one. Why do they use metric hardware?

1279
03:16:03,000 --> 03:16:10,000
It is just the correlation square

1280
03:16:10,000 --> 03:16:18,000
Question.

1281
03:16:18,000 --> 03:16:23,000
Yeah, I will review this briefly tomorrow morning before we move on to project.

1282
03:16:23,000 --> 03:16:26,000
This is the very last which most of them are in the hockey.

1283
03:16:26,000 --> 03:16:31,000
All right. Our square is the Carleton Square. if R.

1284
03:16:31,000 --> 03:16:35,000
Equals 0. Then B's equals 0 then the regression lines flat, and the R.

1285
03:16:35,000 --> 03:16:40,000
Squared equals 0, which means x and y are not associated, which means the regression line.

1286
03:16:40,000 --> 03:16:50,000
Do not explain the variation in y at all. Remember here for regression, which try to use as a pretty good one, as good as we can.

1287
03:16:50,000 --> 03:17:00,000
So we talked to these acts. Yeah, the regret from line to explain the variation you want right, r equals 0 means it doesn't explain at all.

1288
03:17:00,000 --> 03:17:10,000
But if our R squared equals one, which means all the data points line on live on the line, which means the line predict the wife perfectly. okay.

1289
03:17:10,000 --> 03:17:21,000
So as R squared increases from 0 to one x provide more and more information about what that's called coefficient of determination, or it measures the model fit.

1290
03:17:21,000 --> 03:17:27,000
How good it is

1291
03:17:27,000 --> 03:17:33,000
So any questions.

1292
03:17:33,000 --> 03:17:36,000
So I don't want to write on too much map.

1293
03:17:36,000 --> 03:17:43,000
Why, essentially, this is where it come from. so originally? If you just look at why itself, why has a distribution?

1294
03:17:43,000 --> 03:17:54,000
Therefore, why has a variability of variation, and some of our origin is taking away by the line, by the remaining variation.

1295
03:17:54,000 --> 03:17:59,000
The like. Can I explain? Are those Alice by E. So the R.

1296
03:17:59,000 --> 03:18:08,000
Square measures. How much of the variation you know he's taken away by the model rather to the original marriage than you want right?

1297
03:18:08,000 --> 03:18:23,000
If all thoughts, data point lie on the line, then all the Ei will be 0. R. square is one which means the line predict the data perfectly like the line, is flat, which means the lie is not predicting at all simply predicting the

1298
03:18:23,000 --> 03:18:29,000
Wi-fi is over a mean, then the virus in why remains completely.

1299
03:18:29,000 --> 03:18:35,000
Then R squared equals 0. Okay, i'm not going to write on a formula, because that would be even more confusing for some people.

1300
03:18:35,000 --> 03:18:40,000
I'm, explaining a verbally so that you can get what I know.

1301
03:18:40,000 --> 03:18:58,000
Question before we stop today.

1302
03:18:58,000 --> 03:19:03,000
Okay, I know It's kind of a long lecture today, hiring hopefully.

1303
03:19:03,000 --> 03:19:10,000
Tomorrow will be more fun. So remember turning, how are you?

1304
03:19:10,000 --> 03:19:18,000
8, 8, and for lecture 8. The exercise electron 9 will be due on Wednesday.

1305
03:19:18,000 --> 03:19:29,000
So we're gonna do it together tomorrow. so you don't have to even do the quest, although you could if you want. But you don't have to post a deal on one thing and we will probably finish the lecture.

1306
03:19:29,000 --> 03:19:35,000
I will go to exercise tomorrow. and then this doing on one day one day, and

1307
03:19:35,000 --> 03:19:41,000
Are there any one has any question or comment on news to share?

1308
03:19:41,000 --> 03:20:06,000
Oh, give it 1Â min before we close the dog today.

1309
03:20:06,000 --> 03:20:11,000
Okay, thank you very much. have a great rest of your day i'll see you tomorrow morning.

1310
03:20:11,000 --> 03:20:21,000
Yeah, please stop. Yeah. turning things for the lecture, hey? Thank you.
