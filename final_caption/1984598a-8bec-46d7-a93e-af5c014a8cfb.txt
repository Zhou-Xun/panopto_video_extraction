1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:05,410
You're devising something. Each set of friends in a list like this one call.

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:09,320
Each call. All right, everybody.

3
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:17,240
That would be. Hope everyone had a good holiday weekend.

4
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:22,610
I happened to be in Columbus, Ohio, but it was as good as it gets.

5
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:32,030
Thank you. Beat up. Sounds good. Today is the 29th, so we only have today.

6
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:37,250
And Thursday is the end of our lecture session and next week is the group presentations.

7
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:44,720
You'll see the assigned groupings. Please feel free to reach out to me if you have questions about the assignment or if you have any now.

8
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:52,540
Yeah. For a group. For the benzene group. We actually have one person who is not living here that we are here for.

9
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:58,190
Oh, was it what? No. We're a group for doing scenario one, year one.

10
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:01,930
Yeah. So I just flipped the group's because or a taken.

11
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:11,360
It's a long story but yeah. So what's the so are these like dates correct for the groups and other.

12
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:16,219
Yeah. So you're group one. Okay. What group are you.

13
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:22,100
Group four. We were originally group for scenario four, but now we're scenario one.

14
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:25,430
But okay. Group four. Yeah. Okay.

15
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:29,870
Okay. Just want to make sure. Yeah, okay.

16
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:35,640
I think that's correct. Any other questions? No, no, no.

17
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,450
If you have questions or need some prompts or hints on anything, let me know.

18
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:49,820
Um. And. Give you some feedback as needed, like a follow up question.

19
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:53,940
So for the historical context, what were you kind of looking for in the background?

20
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,810
Stuff like that. Depends on the scenario you were given.

21
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:04,130
But, um, you know, just what's known about the, the chemical of interest, the chemical agent and then.

22
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:10,309
What's known about. Where it's founded, things like that.

23
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:14,600
Health effects. Oh, yeah. I mean, it's it's fairly flexible.

24
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,170
Okay. So healing properties usually. Okay. Yeah.

25
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:23,380
So if you're the. Consumer product.

26
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:30,120
You know, you should go into the chemical and then go into the type of products and those types of things for the better.

27
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:35,790
Look at. Any other questions on the projects?

28
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:45,740
Should we be considering how we would approach not only just sampling but also modeling?

29
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:52,200
If you're going to use that far, that's part of the set of tools you want to use.

30
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:55,000
You can go into that a little bit and that's for sure.

31
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:03,520
Yeah, but you know, it's not required of all of all scenarios, but some scenarios it could be very useful right to what you have.

32
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:10,090
So we don't have to do calculations again based on your scenario.

33
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:13,690
Yeah. It may call for or may not.

34
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,910
Or just, you know, how you would do the calculations? Yeah, those types of things.

35
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:29,430
Other questions. All right. So today we're going to talk about biomarkers again.

36
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:33,330
So we talked about biomarkers one time in the context of occupational.

37
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:38,850
Now we're going to talk about it more in the broader environmental context.

38
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:45,570
So if you recall the way back when I don't know how long ago, it's a few weeks ago.

39
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:53,700
We covered definitions, types and history of biomarkers. So we talk about biomarkers of exposure, biomarkers of susceptibility, biomarkers of effect.

40
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:57,600
And then we talked about body burden, task of kinetics and half life,

41
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:03,419
how those are very important and how you apply your biomarkers and then some general considerations.

42
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:07,799
We'll go into more detail today about additional considerations for when to use these.

43
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:15,930
And then we spent some time on the beaches and that's a big difference between occupational environmental,

44
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:20,730
as we'll see is this kind of the application of that. You know, subway.

45
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:27,090
And then finally, some advantages and disadvantages. Last time we talked about it and we'll cover that again today.

46
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:37,740
So today we're touching on some of these issues again and then get into more depth on how to select the biomarker types and who uses applications.

47
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:42,690
And then as time allows, we'll talk about two case study examples at the end.

48
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,510
Also, your patients didn't did a good job. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

49
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:51,870
The slides are really good. All right, I'll let him know.

50
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:58,340
Thank you. So this is a basic review.

51
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,620
So we're talking about, you know,

52
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:06,220
we've talked a lot about different types of environmental media you can measure and that can get at different sources

53
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:14,450
that can be manmade or natural and that can get a little complicated to try to piece together holistic exposure.

54
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:17,200
And if you have to account for all these different things,

55
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:25,480
but they come together to result in some potential external exposure, internal exposure to dose, etc.

56
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:33,510
And here's just another picture showing the complexity of this sea of, you know, outdoor air, indoor air.

57
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:36,030
We'll talk about consumer products on Thursday.

58
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:44,460
General building materials, soil, food, water, different routes, you know, multiple routes for each of these different types of sources.

59
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:53,729
So, again, it paints a bit of a complex picture to try to piece together all of the exposure, which is important, you know, for certain applications.

60
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:58,230
You definitely want to do that for every exposure assessment you ever do.

61
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:03,690
To have to do that every time would probably become not feasible.

62
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:09,690
If it's an agent of interest that is more viral multi pathway for some things.

63
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:18,030
It does make perfect sense if it's, you know, if you're talking about ambient ambient air pollution, then it makes sense to always measure to the air.

64
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:24,960
But if it's something that could be in a lot of different places, then you might want to look into biomarkers and other approaches.

65
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:31,920
Here's the really old picture just focusing on lead, which we talk about a lot.

66
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:36,400
And like I said before, it's one of the most well studied environmental contaminants out there.

67
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:41,190
But, you know, we've we've learned a lot about that.

68
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:45,940
We've done a lot about it, but it's still a problem in a lot of places.

69
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:56,440
And it does tend to relate to socioeconomic status and which relates to some of the primary sources of land and water.

70
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:01,750
Paint or paint in hair, which is less now than it used to be.

71
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:07,300
But certain locations, if it's next to industry, could have higher levels of well, they're going to be found in food.

72
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:14,620
Some things still measure high. But again, painting a picture of the an agent that has a lot of different potential sources,

73
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:22,110
pathways and routes of exposure that can be difficult to get a full grasp right now.

74
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:27,159
If you were to locate which one of those was the most important, then you might focus your study on that.

75
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:33,730
But until you can do that again and might point to something that you can measure, that accounts for all of those.

76
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:40,930
So again, we have our internal bill. This is based on absorption through the routes we talked about earlier in the semester.

77
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:47,020
And then that chemical is going to undergo potentially some sort of metabolic and chemical transformation that's going to

78
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:56,380
lead to it getting either stored in the body somewhere like a fatty tissue or bone in various organs or be eliminated.

79
00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:04,390
And that transformation might be related to making it more hydrophilic and so it can be passed more easily into the urine and things like that.

80
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:12,610
But all of this goes into knowing how a chemical is going to behave within that within the body,

81
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:20,050
which helps think about toxic properties as well as if you were to try to measure a biomarker, where would you want to measure it?

82
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:24,970
And when you do that, what does it mean once you get that resource you have to be able to interpret?

83
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:32,740
So this is another way of showing toxic kinetics and we have our different results of exposure.

84
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:42,910
And just you can go to the GI tract of course, and then makes its way to the liver through the blood things, inhalation and dermal.

85
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:46,690
And again, it can be stored in various places.

86
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:57,640
The kidney is a big one for things like cadmium. And if they come in terms like lead, you know, another heavy metal is stored in the bone.

87
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:02,260
So you can have different things end up in different places. So.

88
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:10,350
Poppies, persistent organic pollutants, and tend to stay in fatty tissue.

89
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:14,360
So you also want to think about where is it going to go?

90
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:17,610
How long does it stay there? And then how does it exit the body eventually?

91
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:21,540
And that can help inform what how you want to measure biomarkers.

92
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:27,179
So as we talked about an occupational set of hearing and if you're in the water, the primary ways to do that.

93
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:34,649
But there's a lot of other possibilities as well. This is the one I always talk about getting on.

94
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:40,920
How do you get Hrb approval to do a study of tears and tears that you generate the tears?

95
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:47,580
And but we've we've done studies for a lot of these different types of of matrices and others.

96
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:55,840
So just again, a quick review. So the main advantage of biomarkers confirms absorption.

97
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,330
The body counts for all the relative exposure.

98
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:05,830
It's an integrated we can detect very low levels depending on how sensitive your method is, and it can be used to validate models.

99
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:12,130
So we need to measure stuff in that different media, put it all together in a model, try to predict an internal dose.

100
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:19,420
You can validate that model by using biomarkers. And then there's other uses as well that we'll talk about throughout today.

101
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,990
But one of the main drawbacks here is if you only have a biomarker, you don't know where the source of exposure is.

102
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:33,820
So again, as far as interpretation and acting on that information, you will probably want additional information with that.

103
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:40,420
And then there's some other details. A lot of them, we don't know what they mean as far as toxicity.

104
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:47,110
So you have to utilize it within the context of, you know, what it's useful for.

105
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:51,969
And then as with anything, you know, you have some lab errors.

106
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:55,930
You want to make sure your methods are of high quality.

107
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:03,460
And again, the ambiguity is another primary drawback from a practice standpoint.

108
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,410
But touch on again later.

109
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:14,810
So when we go about selecting a biomarker, we want something that, you know, you're going to want something that's less invasive if possible.

110
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,460
You're going to want to know it's utility. So by that we mean what is it?

111
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:26,900
What is it telling you when it's we have a concentration report about you, how can you use that meaningfully?

112
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:34,940
So that's what we mean by utility, the specificity and make sure it's measuring chemical that you know what it represents.

113
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:43,249
As we talked about with occupational, some of those are common metabolites for multiple parent companies that can become an issue with specificity.

114
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:48,050
If you're trying to use that measure to take action or regulate,

115
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:54,650
make a standard of a particular chemical if it's a shared metabolite with other chemicals that can become a problem.

116
00:11:56,270 --> 00:12:05,570
Sensitivity, again, limited detection issues can be a big deal, especially now we're talking about non occupational exposures, which tend to be lower.

117
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:12,950
And then for a given chemical, you need to make sure a method exists or else you're you're on your own trying to develop one,

118
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:22,370
which is a very time intensive process. But you want to think about things like was the precision how repeatable over multiple non concentrations

119
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:28,980
is it how since the visit with regards to being able to detect low levels how much sample volume to you.

120
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,799
So you know in my study of tears you're going to need a liter of tears.

121
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,730
That's not going to be feasible. But maybe, you know, one teardrop would be.

122
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,560
But with that small volume,

123
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:47,090
you might run into sensitivity issues with it because you're not going to have as much mass of the chemical collected in that volume.

124
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:55,540
So that's something to keep in mind. And they do tend to be costly, a lot of times more costly than other modes of the sample.

125
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:01,170
Stability. So especially when you're talking about things like blood.

126
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:07,050
There's enzymes in the blood that might be able to break down chemicals of interest.

127
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:16,320
So you want to make sure you know the ins and outs of the method and how to correctly collect the sample, the process the sample stored the sample.

128
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:24,329
And then how long is it good for in the freezer? We have studies that were taking samples out from, you know, 30 years ago and analyzing them.

129
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:30,390
And it's hard to find validation studies of samples. So we try to do you find what you can?

130
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:35,070
To do that. Why would you want to keep this for 30 years?

131
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:42,120
I never looked through it. But that's my own hoarding issue.

132
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,969
But for example,

133
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:54,390
we have a study I worked with based in Mexico where they started out as a lead neurodevelopment study back in the early 1980s or something.

134
00:13:54,450 --> 00:14:00,480
And so, you know, they recruits are recruiting families that had young children are actually when they're pregnant,

135
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:09,720
collected blood samples and things used some at the time to measure blood and then put the rest in the freezer, urine samples as well.

136
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:15,060
And then now we're still using those because now we can go back and some of those kids are having babies of their own now.

137
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:20,040
So we can go back and look at what their exposure was in utero by pulling in samples

138
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,220
of a freezer and measuring them for something that wasn't measurable back then.

139
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,339
So it's it's super valuable,

140
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:33,120
but it's hard to sometimes justify the space and the storage costs when you don't know what you're going to measure in the future.

141
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,720
And then you have to find the resources to do that.

142
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:43,920
Have you ever retested a sample and you tested the same thing 30 years later and the results were significantly different?

143
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:48,990
People have. Yeah. There are certain things that might break down, especially if you're talking about chemical metabolites,

144
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:55,470
hormones, technology of that to a lot of the methods might be more sensitive now than they used to.

145
00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:02,650
Precise. So yeah, good question. But yeah, so I, I have freezers full of samples.

146
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:06,490
I don't know if I'll ever use, but in sample types that I don't need.

147
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,970
So repressors, for example, I'll, I'll come back to it.

148
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:20,440
Yeah. So the Matrix in the last lecture, an occupation, we just focused on blood, urine and a little bit of exhaled air.

149
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:27,250
But, you know, pretty much any biological specimen, you can try to measure stuff and people most likely have.

150
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:33,580
But these are going to be your most common for sure over here, as well as exhaled air.

151
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:39,160
For child development studies, especially for those persistent organics that are lipophilic.

152
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,700
Breast milk becomes a huge thought.

153
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,890
So I was used a lot for stress response.

154
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:53,890
I've seen a little bit on exposure to chemicals, but we've got as much teeth as as another one of which on hair.

155
00:15:54,190 --> 00:16:07,250
And we wouldn't want meconium as. When you are first born, it's that first poop, basically, and it's like very it's like tar.

156
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:11,300
But if you think about that, it's been in the fetus the entire time.

157
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:14,960
So it's a collection of a lot of stuff in there.

158
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:21,290
So it's kind of a potentially a magical sample when you talk about in utero chemical exposures.

159
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:24,320
But talking with chemists, they really hate working with it because it's.

160
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:28,780
It's it's it's not it's not easy to work with kids.

161
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:39,189
And the consistency of it is, is tough. So but it has a lot of potential, I think, because thinking about in utero exposures, amniotic fluid.

162
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:42,519
So that's an example of an invasive, you know, I think, you know,

163
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:47,980
if they don't do any of that since much anymore so that one is is tough to get these days.

164
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,360
Same with adipose tissue. Things like that.

165
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:56,770
So there is and again, if you measure it in one of these, you kind of want to know what it means.

166
00:16:56,830 --> 00:17:00,400
You know, is it likely to have been stored there, things like that.

167
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:11,390
So there's a lot of options. I'll talk about a few of the most common ones here with a little more depth than we did last time.

168
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:15,260
So you're in general, is this considered to be easy and noninvasive?

169
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:22,340
A limitation of that is very young children. It can be difficult to get a urine sample because they're not potty trained yet.

170
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:30,920
They actually have researched diapers. People have tried to market because if you just get stores sort of diapers,

171
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:35,870
they have a lot of additives, you know, percent absorption and things like that.

172
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:42,440
So. So it's it's tough to figure out how do you collect urine from a six month old or something like that.

173
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:49,729
But in general, for people that can get a reliable sample, you can usually get a pretty large sample volume.

174
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:55,550
So again, those detection issues become less prominent sometimes if you have a large, large volume.

175
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:02,910
One of the disadvantages here is sometimes you're limited to measuring the metabolite as opposed to the parent compound.

176
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:09,510
So then you go think about is that a common metabolite to other parent compounds that specificity issue potentially.

177
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:17,730
And we also need to know a lot about how that chemicals metabolized and distributed to make sense of it.

178
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:24,180
The other one we touched on briefly before is hydration level. So you mentioned creatine before.

179
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:31,110
There's also specific gravity elements related to name, but not quite as related to some of those personal factors.

180
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:36,690
But that's an important thing that's always there when we talk about the urine sample.

181
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:44,520
So the way people try to get around that, in addition to creating a specific gravity, is to do a sample collection.

182
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:56,130
The other way is to so we talk about creating and then if you don't have crowding or specific gravity in other way, you can try to get at that volume.

183
00:18:56,370 --> 00:19:05,340
Question And hydration is knowing the exact time between voids and then the exact amount of volume that was excreted.

184
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,730
Then you can sort of calculate and normalize it.

185
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:15,660
But that is also difficult in practice because people may not remember exactly the last time they use the restroom.

186
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:22,890
And then, you know, depending on how the collection goes, that can get not ideal.

187
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:30,900
The other issue with hearing is when to collect the sample. So a lot of studies will do the first morning void.

188
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:39,719
Do you think you know, that is thought to be a larger reservoir had time to build up overnight so might be a more

189
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:45,480
concentrated sample to be more likely to get a detectable level of your chemical of interest.

190
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:51,990
So that's one potential that can be difficult to get in practice as well, because people, when they wake up,

191
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:58,170
they want to use the restroom and not have to worry about all the sample protocols and coming into a clinic or something.

192
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:03,240
So what's more, much more common is a spot sample and that's just getting the sample when you can.

193
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:11,250
But that can be difficult with regards to what it means throughout day and with hydration.

194
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,900
The other option that people have tried is a 24 hour sample.

195
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:22,910
This one also has some major logistic issues, but in theory you have 24 hours worth of sample.

196
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:30,629
You could then say that much has been excreted per day and that would be much more relatable to your dose level of,

197
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:34,740
you know, how we talk about dose milligrams per kilogram per day or something.

198
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,610
However, collecting that is not good in the study.

199
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:43,830
People have tried something like this. Would you participate in a study where they ask you to carry this around all day?

200
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:47,129
You know nobody's going to do that, right?

201
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:54,960
So you can find studies that have done 24 hour samples, but they're usually like ten people and it's usually like they're colleagues or something.

202
00:20:55,290 --> 00:21:00,509
So it's it's usually not very representative because people who do agree they might just stay home the entire time.

203
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:03,540
And that's not to be representative of their their normal exposure anyway.

204
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:13,740
So here in this group we use it all the time, but you just need to know some of the details about it before before deciding to go that route.

205
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:18,940
Any questions on your. All right.

206
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:25,570
We move on to blood. So blood has a couple of advantages over urine in general.

207
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:30,490
And that is a lot of times you can measure the parent compound or a known metabolite.

208
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:38,410
It's sometimes thought to be more toxic, toxic relevant compared to urine.

209
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:45,730
Again, maybe generally, but it's hard to prove that just because we know that blood gets circulated throughout the body.

210
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:51,069
So that kind of thing. The other thing is you don't have to worry about the hydration issue.

211
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:55,180
You do have some variability there. You don't have it's a closed system.

212
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:59,590
So it's not going to be as variable throughout the day, urine as or between people.

213
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:10,560
Pregnancy doesn't introduce a little bit of this with something called plasma volume expansion, but in general, it's much more of a closed system.

214
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:15,160
You don't have to worry too much about that. The main disadvantages of blood, of course,

215
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:21,219
is it is invasive to collect why people scare needles and then for non persistent compounds

216
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:25,090
it can be problematic because they might be cleared from the blood quite rapidly,

217
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:33,069
often in English before. The other thing you want to be careful of with blood is that you have that sample

218
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:37,150
collection and processing that's most appropriate for what you're interested in.

219
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:41,440
So here's an example of a blood sample. You have your plasma.

220
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:45,280
It's about half over half your red blood cells.

221
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:51,070
Well, less than half. And then you have this what they call the puffy coat. It's where the white blood cells are are cut.

222
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:56,949
So apparently you want to measure, you might need different ones of these and for different fractions,

223
00:22:56,950 --> 00:23:01,239
you might need special tubes that will preserve the blood sample.

224
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:08,350
So for metals, for example, the one we usually use is a whole blood sample.

225
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:15,990
So with that you need anti-clotting factors built into your tube, so your pool of your sample is clot up and then you can measure later.

226
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:23,710
And for metals you have to make sure there's no contamination. So they actually sell metals free tubes with an anticoagulant for that purpose.

227
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:31,410
Plasma we use a lot for. Things and metabolomics as well.

228
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:36,720
As far as I'm concerned with the same thing, basically it's just plasma has the clotting factors and serum does not.

229
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:43,350
So if you're [INAUDIBLE] plasma, you need to have an anticoagulant, whereas serum you just let it coagulate.

230
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:51,120
When you pull it pulls your white blood cells again my both because that's where you're doing anything involving DNA.

231
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:58,220
So DNA attacks for chemical exposures, genomics epigenomics.

232
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,760
It's where you want to get your sample and you have the red blood cells.

233
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:07,770
So I mentioned I never saw anything, just tons and tons of RBC samples.

234
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:16,379
So I have purpose for all the other fractions I was collecting and hoping that something comes along that's going to fill these as I see this,

235
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:23,060
because if I throw them away and then something comes out, I just kind of I won't be able to know it.

236
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:34,679
So yeah. And when you're talking about chemicals, sometimes that chemical of interest might interact with the preservative.

237
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:40,710
So you want to make sure that's kept in mind for certain pesticides we've done.

238
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:48,540
There are some preservatives that are better at stopping the metabolism within the sample than others.

239
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:54,230
So. A lot of that takes trial here, a lot of testing and retesting.

240
00:24:55,820 --> 00:25:01,640
So we said for blood, you don't have the hydration issues, but you do have lipophilic compounds.

241
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:06,020
You can't throw things off based on the number of lipids in the blood.

242
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:15,860
So we do a lot of time to correct or adjust for lipid lipids in a blood sample if we're looking at persistent organic chemicals that are.

243
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:27,850
Just a place to do that. And more recently, a lot of people are understand dried blood spots because you don't have the the big venous needle issue.

244
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:36,860
And you can use it with. What more volume necessary for newborns?

245
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:41,090
It's a lot easier to collect that actually in the state of Michigan. They archive those.

246
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:48,800
So there's a lot of interest in being able to use that, but there's a ton of limitations as well as regards to contamination, low sample volume.

247
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:55,550
The denominator, even like the per spot, because you can't be like per milliliter.

248
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:00,870
It's just a dried blood. So there's a lot of issues there, but it's got some problems.

249
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:08,850
The difference between serum and plasma. Plasma has these clotting factors in it.

250
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:15,580
So, you know. It doesn't make a lot.

251
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:25,420
Usually for if you're measuring chemicals, plasmas, they're usually used either ones that was validated in our metabolomics or proven doing.

252
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:29,650
They say they prefer the plasma. Because it's got a little extra.

253
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:41,009
Bad breath for vaccines.

254
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:45,510
This may be useful when you might be able use some of the same types of bags we talk about with.

255
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:51,330
We talk about bags for traditional doses, but it tends to be noninvasive to collect.

256
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,719
You can click allow repeated samples, which you can in a short period of time,

257
00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:00,840
which you can't really do with water here, but you're going to be limited in what types of things you can measure.

258
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:04,740
And we have a lack of standardization in methods.

259
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:09,420
So for blood and urine, as you saw with like the beaches, there's a lot of standardization.

260
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:17,589
And how they how they do things. But with Brett, it's not so much that there's really standards.

261
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:27,010
But you also when we talked about the airways, you know, you have the lower lungs with the alveoli of the gas exchange region,

262
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:30,969
which is where you would want that sample probably to come from,

263
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:34,240
because that's going to reflect what's coming out of the blood and into the exhaled breath.

264
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:38,420
We have all this dead space, so how do you adjust for that or account for that?

265
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:45,250
Your sample? You might need a special sampler that gets rid of that dead space before it collects that out of your hair.

266
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:54,460
So that's another sort of unknown that that's a variable, and then you have different ways of collecting this.

267
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:04,760
I look at that one as much personal. Hair and nails.

268
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:09,650
This storm has gotten a lot more attention lately.

269
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:17,360
So advantages against it's pretty noninvasive, I guess, depending on how attached people are to their hair and nails.

270
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:23,820
But. It's sort of noninvasive, cost effective potentially.

271
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:29,860
You don't have a lot of the storage issues, things like the processing that you might have with the other sample price.

272
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:37,810
The big one that I'm interested in once I have a minute is to look more into this time sequence of exposure.

273
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:44,260
So, you know, if you have a long enough hair, anything closer to the scalp is going to represent more recent exposure.

274
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:48,310
And the further out you gets can represent how long it took for that to grow out, that part.

275
00:28:49,180 --> 00:29:00,870
So that's got, I think, a lot of potential. Time time sequencing of the exposure, but nobody's really done that very systematically.

276
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:12,310
So this means there is external contamination. So you're you want what's in the hair to have grown from inside the body, not landed on the hair.

277
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,830
So there's a lot of processing to do there.

278
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:20,450
And again, kind of like with Exhale, there was no not like a lot of standardized methods.

279
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:28,310
So you can find methods out there that like some scientist in Luxembourg did, but it hasn't been really hasn't really caught on.

280
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:32,270
So the sort of the Wild West kind of like you talk about with dust sampling,

281
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:37,099
non persistent chemicals, we're starting to see these in these types of samples.

282
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:42,440
But again, it's not super systematic yet. So I'm I have my eye on that for the future.

283
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:49,220
And then what do you do in studies where there's been consistent hair across people and things like that in newborns?

284
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:57,510
Other other populations. Where to cut and when to cooperate.

285
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:03,770
Differences, simple washing procedures. All those have to be worked out for the better.

286
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:07,560
So in our Puerto Rico study, we do we have been collecting hair from the beginning.

287
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:15,570
We haven't used it yet. So I'm kind of waiting till I see like just the right method to to to use those for.

288
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:24,660
I used to work with it. Yeah. What do you measure? It's just tuberculosis medications and some patients.

289
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:30,650
Oh, okay. Very cool. Um, we've tried collecting toenails.

290
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:36,240
Not popular in the Puerto Rico population. You know, where a lot of flip flops, a lot of pedicures, things like that.

291
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:42,900
So, one, they don't want to give you their nails into you have, you know, potential external contamination with.

292
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:52,209
Polish. And then the other woman holds a lot of promises.

293
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:55,380
Talked about a lot. Haven't seen a ton in practice yet.

294
00:30:55,390 --> 00:31:02,610
It's teeth. So especially when we're talking about child development, that's where a lot of people are interested in this.

295
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:07,290
But so, you know, you have your baby to follow. So it can be noninvasive.

296
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:16,209
Work out a deal with the tooth fairy. You might go get a lot of samples right for not much pain and this as well because

297
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:21,040
those teeth are developing from the time in the womb until they're there should.

298
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:28,250
You can get some look at them in various layers of the tooth to try to get that kind of exposure as well.

299
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:31,090
So that, again, holds a lot of promise.

300
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:38,859
Currently, there's only a few labs that do this and it's, I think, very labor intensive to get that kind of resolution.

301
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:45,350
So it hasn't really been put into practice. Just wanted to introduce the concept here.

302
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:54,860
Like epidemiologically. I've seen studies that have taken people just like crush them up and then measured blood or something.

303
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:00,030
But that's not quite as sophisticated as what I think the potential for that is.

304
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:11,690
So like I said, there's a lot of different options. This is just a partial listing here of different matrices.

305
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:17,030
This is from a while back, the original National Children's Study.

306
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:23,450
They put this together, but some of the more promising matrices there on the left, how it's collected,

307
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:32,220
whether or not they find it invasive, and that may differ depending on who you ask and what late stage it might be feasible to call it.

308
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:37,600
So just from a. A review paper a while back.

309
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:45,490
Anybody else worked with any of these types of virus specimens?

310
00:32:52,040 --> 00:33:00,710
So why don't we use biomarkers? So as I said, you know, you have your integrated exposure, a measure of internal absorption, but, you know,

311
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:09,110
for what applications see, a clinical use is research uses, which is what a lot of what I do public health or policy.

312
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:18,710
So you know what? So there's a sequence to how you might able to use it in these various settings, but we'll talk about that.

313
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:22,999
So you have, you know, in general through descriptive or risk based descriptive research,

314
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,760
like who's exposed where and what the impact is more of a risk based as if,

315
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:32,170
you know, on a certain level means you can apply it to, you know,

316
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:38,600
risk of getting the disease or, you know, try to try to estimate that with this model.

317
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:46,990
So this is just a more expanded list of some various applications.

318
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:57,520
So in some of the scenarios I gave you guys for the group projects, you know, kind of a haphazard couple of people have high levels or something.

319
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:04,210
So, you know, you might be up in here somewhere, but there's ways to fill that out more systematic way.

320
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:07,720
And then maybe look into some of these other applications as well.

321
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:16,120
With regards to investigate potential source status and trend over time as usual, it's very important.

322
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:20,260
And I'll show some examples in a little bit. Health research.

323
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:29,500
So I use it in my stuff for epidemiology, but you can also use it in toxicology, pharmaco, pharmacy, pharmacokinetics, research as well.

324
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:39,000
And finally, risk assessment is where people really want to apply it, but there's a long road to get there before you can really apply.

325
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:44,860
So blood work has gone on other than that for chemical exposures.

326
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:56,920
It's a bit limited. So again, biomarkers may not be able to tell you where the source of the exposure came from.

327
00:34:57,490 --> 00:35:04,240
But if you start using a biomarker within a larger structure where you think about sources,

328
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:12,310
pathways of that exposure all the way to the continuum of disease, we're good with your biologically effective dose, things like that.

329
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:19,300
It can be extremely important or useful. So you have your biomarker here.

330
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:23,779
You can go upstream and look at some of those external exposures.

331
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:29,469
So when the air concentrations that they were exposed to where the water, soil, things like that,

332
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:37,060
food and then go up to even in other words, how do we get into the interior soil, water, dust, food, things like that?

333
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:39,280
And then you can go further down this way.

334
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:49,120
Look at are there adult protein adults or something that we could get as a biomarker in effect or a biologically effective dose?

335
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:54,610
And then as it related to other things, other changes in the body related to a specific disease.

336
00:35:55,990 --> 00:36:00,760
So ideally you'd have data that you can connect each of these points.

337
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:04,690
It's rare to find that reality, but that's always the goal.

338
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:15,040
If you were to do a bio monitoring study. These are the steps, some of the main steps you'd want to take.

339
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:22,720
If you start here at the top three hypothesis, you know, what are you trying to find is a particular chemical, a group of chemicals,

340
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:31,120
a bunch of different groups of chemicals, and what kind of health outcome or whatever it might be or source of exposure.

341
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:36,700
You select your population. And then this is a big one. You select what the biomarker you're going to measure.

342
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:43,660
That is, make sure it's a validated method. And with that comes a lot of, you know, ethical considerations.

343
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:49,180
How do you communicate this? You need to know, you know, once you get data, how are you going to analyze it?

344
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:56,080
So knowing what can you do to sleep beforehand as well as as we talked about toxicology next to the chemical,

345
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:59,980
you need to know where where you might find it.

346
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:04,600
And then if you do find it there, what does it mean with regards to an overall exposure?

347
00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:10,120
You recruit and roll your participants, make sure you have informed consent,

348
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:15,160
you collect and process your samples according to the protocol that you've decided on.

349
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:20,920
And then you do your lab analysis. Yeah, if you like. We bank a lot of samples as well later.

350
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:25,270
Right. And then your statistical analysis and interpret the results.

351
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:35,470
And this is a big one here. This is where we struggle. Communication of those results to individuals, clinic clinical setting, policy makers, etc.

352
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:43,480
Yes. Is there some sort of database where investigators are able to basically advertise for samples

353
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:47,620
of that fact and someone can go look all multiverse this kind of sample and filter it out.

354
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:50,290
All these people have these samples. That's a good idea.

355
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:56,860
There is one in Seattle called Gaps For, do you know, perinatal child research and they sell them.

356
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:03,999
But there's others other national studies that do have like I mentioned, the National Children's Day.

357
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,430
They had a bunch of bank samples that people could apply to to get.

358
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:15,100
So that does exist here and there for sure. Yeah, good question.

359
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:21,340
That would save a lot of time and effort if you're able to find somebody else's samples that fit.

360
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:26,350
Again, I'm not sure it fits your hypothesis. And here you're trying to do.

361
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:32,629
Methodological issues. Analytical techniques.

362
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:35,120
So we got a lot of exposure to this back in the occupation.

363
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:40,460
We to be look at their methods but also when we talk about VDI that you dig into that a little bit.

364
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:47,810
Environmental contamination. So you know how do you prevent that if you're trying to find it in a certain.

365
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:56,500
Bio specimen. We want to make sure it's collected in the environment in a way that's not going to add artificially to that sample.

366
00:38:56,650 --> 00:39:00,820
That's one of the reasons urine is good. If you're measuring a metabolite.

367
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:05,860
If that metabolite doesn't exist on its own in the environment, that kind of takes out that.

368
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:08,220
Contamination concern.

369
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:14,790
So I do a lot of work with Alex, for example, and we have certain metabolites that we measure in the urine that are found in the environment.

370
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:18,329
And because phthalates are everywhere, that's another reason to measure.

371
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:25,020
And urine is is thought to be better than blood for that particular laboratory as well.

372
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:32,969
So. There's several papers out there, you know, talk about consumer products next time.

373
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:35,520
But some of those types of chemicals,

374
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:42,270
basically people working in the lab can't wear certain deodorants and things like that because they found contamination.

375
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:48,810
Same with dust flame retardants. It's really a lot of the returns are actually hard to measure.

376
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:56,850
In a sense that way because it's in the dust everywhere. So that's left termination.

377
00:39:57,930 --> 00:40:06,210
We talked about sensitivity and things for the study design, so make sure you have a reason for measuring just because you can't.

378
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:12,570
This helps and then applying it to the question of interest.

379
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:20,129
So there's a lot there to think about and then you get your results.

380
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:24,390
So, you know, depending on the matrix, the units are going to vary.

381
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:35,100
And also the relative amount that you're thinking about is also very so even within some of these pages, nanograms per liter might be a common unit,

382
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:42,690
whereas, you know, for organophosphate fatalities might be micrograms per liter depending on the relative abundance there.

383
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:48,930
And again, it's always on it's the only one that we talk about in terms of deciliter.

384
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:55,709
So that can be confusing. You just want to make sure you're looking at the right thing mentioned.

385
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:59,280
You might want to adjust for lipids or with urine.

386
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:02,300
Maybe it's creatine. So if you're normalizing.

387
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,830
Sensitivity and limited detection.

388
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:14,640
So in one place, a lot of times you might be able to get away with a less sensitive method, which a lot of times will save you some money.

389
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:19,200
So usually a method is it's cheaper to do.

390
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:25,830
But if we're on the left here thinking about environmental exposures, you know, nobody to here might be pushing it.

391
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:31,200
You might have majority of samples for women detection. Then you're not going to be able to do as much with your data.

392
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:35,820
So you might need to think about that would be one which might cost more money,

393
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:40,890
might require different considerations for your sample collection and processing.

394
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:45,530
But even if you're going to be happy, you did that later on in your data back.

395
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:49,800
So it's the sensitivity issue.

396
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:56,030
And we talked earlier about how to handle l0d values and things like that, which can be a challenge.

397
00:41:57,260 --> 00:42:01,190
We also talked before about Half-Life, and I gave the example of the, you know,

398
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:12,590
the nice eight hour exposures for one week at work and had that sawtooth sort of profile with a biomarker depending on how, how long lived it is.

399
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:20,570
And nobody hears more of a non occupational example where you have a time period of exposure here.

400
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:26,569
So here's your real exposure. It's highly variable. Over 400 days.

401
00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:29,690
Yeah, over 400 days. Just kind of all over the place.

402
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:34,790
And if it's a biomarker with a short half life, this is what your biomarker looks like.

403
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:39,769
So if you're like me and you're trying to apply it to an epidemiologist study, depending on where you are,

404
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:45,080
that can make a huge difference on what that exposure assignment is going to be for that person that happens to be here.

405
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:51,320
They're going to be a highly exposed person in your study. If you happen to catch them here, they're going to be a low exposure.

406
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:56,750
So pay on the outcome of interest. You may need to take multiple samples or have some sort of.

407
00:42:57,890 --> 00:43:02,390
Integrated sample over time to account for the variability the longer half life.

408
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:07,400
So this is a half life from one day, one month, so it's a little more stable here.

409
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:12,430
This would be something like heavy metals and blood. What types might be months?

410
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:18,440
Some of the personal care product chemicals we talk about would be like this.

411
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:23,580
And then some of your purchased narcotics, for example, you might have something.

412
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:31,680
And this is the one year where you would have. I have a much more stable exposure level depending on what the current.

413
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:35,990
So that plays into how you design your studies.

414
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:42,580
So if you're looking at something like this and only have one sample per person, that could be if think about that, you've got to play.

415
00:43:44,770 --> 00:43:52,979
Any questions on that? You better have a soccer score.

416
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:59,220
3210104. It's almost two zero at halftime.

417
00:44:00,490 --> 00:44:06,410
I don't know. It's all right. Halfway. So let me talk about halfway.

418
00:44:06,550 --> 00:44:10,810
You can make a difference as to if even for the same chemical, what matrix you choose to use.

419
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:23,350
And so talk about a chemical that's that's metabolized your blood is a lot of times not desirable just for this fact right here.

420
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:31,600
But you have an exposure and make the process super fast. So you don't know we're on this extreme slope, your ticket collecting your sample.

421
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:38,319
But again, that's going to make a big difference on how you designate that person's exposure of this.

422
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:42,090
One is very hard to read. Neon green here is urine.

423
00:44:42,370 --> 00:44:46,629
So you get a little bit of metabolite. It, it spreads it out a little bit.

424
00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:52,480
So it's a little more stable over that time period. There's still work being done trying to get padlocks.

425
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:55,240
They're kind of hard to measure right now, not widely used,

426
00:44:55,720 --> 00:45:02,080
but if they can figure that out would stretch out even more stable for some of these short lived chemicals.

427
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:09,629
All right. Switching gears here. Oh, yeah, absolutely.

428
00:45:09,630 --> 00:45:13,620
Just curious for I think I've heard like they're sampling stuff.

429
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:19,320
We're talking about some like the bags are made of things that we might not remember, like how many chemicals in plastics and stuff.

430
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:28,820
It's the same issue, true for like blood and urine samples and has anyone telling how much that might impact the demonstration or not or anything?

431
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:35,459
That's a great question. Absolutely. So I do a lot with plastic related chemicals.

432
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:39,390
So and we put our samples in plastic. So you do have to do a lot of validation upfront.

433
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:46,890
With prime examples, you know, well, back before I was the big concern and back then everyone carrying around the

434
00:45:46,890 --> 00:45:52,110
water bottles by a brand called Nalgene is that polycarbonate clear plastic?

435
00:45:52,800 --> 00:46:00,510
And that was, you know, where it just so happened that the sample collection tubes were also made by the same company, Nalgene.

436
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:07,170
But luckily it was a different it was polypropylene and polycarbonate, and they don't as compared to polypropylene.

437
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:17,999
So we lucked out there. But yeah, you do want to validate for sure the tubes I mentioned, the metal free tubes, even the syringes they use for metals.

438
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:25,320
They want to make sure that's not contaminated. She says sometimes things would have a tough one.

439
00:46:27,110 --> 00:46:30,530
Be careful that your samples.

440
00:46:30,990 --> 00:46:37,250
Much of the polyurethane foam filters is actually a prime use of PBDEs in furniture.

441
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:45,750
So you just want to make sure that polyurethane foam and using in your sampling is not have a ton of flame retardants if your memory is going to turn.

442
00:46:45,770 --> 00:46:51,440
So. Great question. And something you really want to figure out before it's too late, right?

443
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:55,970
Because that can make your data useless. Any other questions?

444
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:03,889
All right. So who gets the results and why? Exposures.

445
00:47:03,890 --> 00:47:09,140
New context. A lot of times we can answer this depending on what we're measuring the source in the round.

446
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:14,020
If all we have is a biomarker, we don't know. We know potentially, generally how people might be exposed.

447
00:47:14,030 --> 00:47:16,820
That can help. But for that individual, we do not know.

448
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:25,220
A lot of times bioavailability, what's it mean with regards to, you know, what's it doing to your body as well as toxicity?

449
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:29,060
And it's not well study, not well known like what it is.

450
00:47:29,070 --> 00:47:33,680
And finally, a lot of chemicals. We aren't sure yet how best to reduce exposure.

451
00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:41,630
So what do you do with that information? And then depending on where you're doing the study.

452
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:49,690
You know, if a community you're measuring, they get their samples and they're like, okay, we've contributed this study.

453
00:47:49,690 --> 00:47:54,700
Now we're looking for things to get better. Sometimes that that doesn't happen right away.

454
00:47:54,700 --> 00:48:00,730
So you have to be realistic with the communities you're working with that these things can take time.

455
00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:06,040
We do report back in our Puerto Rico study, but it's good.

456
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:12,520
It's it's pregnant women. So by the time we're able to batch samples, get them to the lab, analyze them, get the data back.

457
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:15,730
They're not pregnant anymore. And then we report the results.

458
00:48:15,910 --> 00:48:22,450
So it's there are some issues with that kind of thing, too, where it's so they can use that maybe for a subsequent pregnancy.

459
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:25,060
But, you know, it's there is a lag period there.

460
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:32,580
And then, like I said, with some of limitations, talked about for the ambiguity of just what it means for me.

461
00:48:33,230 --> 00:48:38,030
Toxicity and risk perspective. It's not a lot of time to know with a particular chemical.

462
00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:46,360
So here are some examples from this book of bio monitoring that was written a while back.

463
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:55,890
But, you know, for various things and you have some interpretive options, usually it's kind of like what's the distribution in the population?

464
00:48:56,230 --> 00:49:01,930
You can identify some or how they expose individuals maybe related to, you know,

465
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:10,780
some geographical or other types of information to get some general information on potential sources, things like that.

466
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:22,200
So this is kind of interpreting it outward. For someone like me, I'm using it to relate to something else, like a health effect.

467
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:26,170
And then we might relate that information.

468
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:32,790
That what we found. But if you just have the biomarker level, blood tests were limited.

469
00:49:33,630 --> 00:49:39,180
So that's just generally what you do. So sort of trends and trends, distributions, things like that.

470
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:43,560
When you get to clinically, incidence can be important.

471
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:49,530
So I mentioned blood, but they have guidelines for that and processes for triggering things that happen.

472
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:53,969
But beyond that, it's not really well-defined.

473
00:49:53,970 --> 00:49:56,780
What is safe on say things like that.

474
00:49:56,790 --> 00:50:04,710
So this is where it differs a lot with the occupational setting, with the as they know that that relates to an air concentration that is the top.

475
00:50:05,430 --> 00:50:08,970
And there are things that you can do and interpretations you can do with that.

476
00:50:09,450 --> 00:50:13,380
When it comes to environmental. We don't have a lot of that available.

477
00:50:13,590 --> 00:50:17,080
So, again, there's there's a lot of ambiguity. For most nights.

478
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:28,280
So again, what we're a lot of times at the individual level, what we focus on is kind of what's that distribution and that individual.

479
00:50:29,570 --> 00:50:40,520
We want to pitch that high tail of the distribution and then use that to inform what are they doing throughout their day or you know,

480
00:50:40,610 --> 00:50:44,040
what is it about them that makes their level so high compared to everyone else?

481
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:48,710
And that can really be useful for determining sources of exposure and things like that.

482
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:56,180
And then once you know the sources of exposure, you can go back to those people and say your level is higher than most other people.

483
00:50:56,420 --> 00:51:07,760
Here are the ways you might be able to reduce your exposure. We can also use those highly exposed people to look at health effects as well.

484
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:16,880
So it's useful to report back. So people who are participating in the bio monitoring study, this is becoming much more common.

485
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:20,149
You know, ten years ago, hardly anybody did this.

486
00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:26,330
But now it's you know, people who are giving resources to these studies wants to want to see this as part of the study.

487
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:33,650
So here's an example from the California study on pretty flame retardants, kind of like talking about the chemical,

488
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:40,790
what they know about the chemical from a health effect perspective and exposure reduction perspective.

489
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:45,680
But then on the risk side, it's hard to say because they're actively studying it.

490
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:49,160
So they don't know what a certain level might be for health.

491
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:54,380
But a lot of this general exposure reduction can be useful.

492
00:51:54,890 --> 00:52:02,810
And then again, showing their level compared to some population, whether it's U.S. population in general or other people in that study.

493
00:52:03,770 --> 00:52:07,430
So I've been thinking about this since Dr. Watkins came.

494
00:52:07,610 --> 00:52:16,610
Yeah. And my question is, I just forgot something about.

495
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:22,890
That might. That's fine. Just. Alina?

496
00:52:23,010 --> 00:52:28,530
Yeah. I mean, I think it happens, Neal. I'm glad I'm not the only one, but I'll keep going.

497
00:52:28,530 --> 00:52:33,420
And you just. And when when you go. Okay, so this is one study.

498
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:39,000
Our study we have we have this phone app that we started called.

499
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:46,890
The study is called Protect. So it's called Protect. This is the English translation, but this is an example of phthalates.

500
00:52:47,370 --> 00:52:52,829
Talking about this particular participant in our study, we have three visits during pregnancy.

501
00:52:52,830 --> 00:52:58,080
This is there three different measurements we took and then where it falls in the distribution of the.

502
00:53:00,870 --> 00:53:04,980
We compare it with other people in our study as well as us in general.

503
00:53:05,190 --> 00:53:07,110
And then again, we're limited what we can say.

504
00:53:07,530 --> 00:53:14,129
This is how a lot of people we know, a lot of people are exposed to certain types of food, certain types of products, things like that.

505
00:53:14,130 --> 00:53:23,520
But without more information, we don't know specifically for that person how they're being exposed until we're able to do more investigation.

506
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:33,600
Ethical issues. So for any of these studies, informed consent is a big deal.

507
00:53:33,850 --> 00:53:39,630
If we collect specimens from anyone, we need to let them know exactly what you're planning to do with it and things like that.

508
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:41,910
And you know,

509
00:53:42,350 --> 00:53:52,500
a lot of times the populations that really need the information that we need to know why they're more highly exposed and what that's doing.

510
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:56,459
It's even that much more important to make sure they understand what the study

511
00:53:56,460 --> 00:54:00,780
is and why it's being done and that they're not being taken advantage of,

512
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:02,450
which there's a long history of that.

513
00:54:02,450 --> 00:54:09,870
And if you take the some of the training, the human subjects turn you into is required here, start as a student Biobank.

514
00:54:10,110 --> 00:54:14,730
You know, like I said, it's great. It becomes much messier when you're talking about genetic material.

515
00:54:15,090 --> 00:54:18,710
So why people get. Very hesitant to do that.

516
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:21,930
So you need to make sure that it's also conservative.

517
00:54:21,930 --> 00:54:27,980
That's something you're going to do. And those standards can differ depending on where you're working.

518
00:54:27,990 --> 00:54:35,640
So we want to make sure it's being done to the best of your ability and conflicts of interest.

519
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:40,660
Always an issue. That goes beyond biological.

520
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:53,090
Okay. A lot of different national bio monitoring programs exist in the U.S. and other places, and there's an increasing number of these going on.

521
00:54:54,110 --> 00:55:06,650
So in the US historically and Haynes is the big one there, was cheered here and been one for the state of California and internationally of Canada.

522
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:12,650
The EU had a bunch of different countries that were doing their own enforcement for EU.

523
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:20,950
There's actually a database you can find that. It's so useful information there and some other things as well.

524
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:26,990
And Heinz is the biggest one we have here in the US. It started a long time ago.

525
00:55:27,530 --> 00:55:35,870
And he's a general again. So that was much more questionnaire based, talking about what people eat or what they do, things like that.

526
00:55:36,410 --> 00:55:39,440
But then at some point, this for a subset.

527
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:48,170
So in Heinz, in Germany, things like 10,000 people every two years, for about 2000 people every two years, they started doing some bio monitoring.

528
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:52,190
And so they do it in a way that's representative.

529
00:55:52,190 --> 00:55:58,850
So they have straight up based on age, gender and race and to measure various chemicals.

530
00:56:01,950 --> 00:56:05,790
So here's a sample table.

531
00:56:06,090 --> 00:56:13,650
This one happens to be for your mental pyramid, and you're in over a five, six year period from oh 5 to 2010.

532
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:22,770
And I'm just going to take a drink of water and let you see if you can conclude anything from this table.

533
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:55,210
Any observations? It takes a while to get to know what you're looking at, I guess.

534
00:56:57,970 --> 00:57:04,780
See how the different stratified variables on here three year periods and on your.

535
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:08,299
Exposure distribution points across the top.

536
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:18,920
There is increasing over the years, oh, maybe slightly for certain subgroups, but that's not probably what we would catch mainly first.

537
00:57:23,450 --> 00:57:26,990
Human trafficking is a lot harder for females. You know.

538
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:32,100
It sure is. Yeah. Why do you think that might be?

539
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:37,270
Do we know anything about methyl carbon? Oh, yeah.

540
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:48,030
They're engineers. Yeah. Personal care products. So, in general, um, you know, perhaps make ups and things like that might be used more frequently.

541
00:57:49,130 --> 00:57:54,880
What about race? Ethnicity? So you think there. It's been increasing Mexican-Americans.

542
00:57:56,620 --> 00:58:06,550
It hurts slightly, but there's a more stark difference between the groups non-Hispanic black much, much higher.

543
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:11,440
So again, is that related to where they live? Is it related to activities?

544
00:58:12,130 --> 00:58:18,820
In this particular case, you know, it's a hypothesis because of what we know about that impairment might be,

545
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:24,220
again, due to personal care, product patterns and specific products used in amounts used.

546
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:29,680
But we don't know until we would do a sub study that clued some of that information.

547
00:58:31,730 --> 00:58:37,850
So it's just one example. There are tons of these out there. But they're very careful in communicating their results,

548
00:58:37,850 --> 00:58:45,920
saying just because we measure this in people's urine or blood doesn't mean it's harmful, blah, blah, blah.

549
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:51,260
Know so very official. So just because there doesn't mean it's harmful, we don't know yet what it means.

550
00:58:51,620 --> 00:59:02,350
Things like that, which is a. This is very hard to read and it signifies that they've added a ton of different biomarkers.

551
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:07,990
So this is basically just showing different cycle years.

552
00:59:08,140 --> 00:59:12,060
And then these are all panels of chemicals that you measured in various here.

553
00:59:12,070 --> 00:59:19,480
So if we back in 99, they measured things like tobacco products and pesticides, things like that.

554
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:26,229
And then they started measuring more pass. A lot of different pesticide classes.

555
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:29,620
Bosses. Heterocyclic amines. Metals.

556
00:59:30,190 --> 00:59:39,320
PBDEs. PCBs. Dioxins. So again, this is a large database of different years.

557
00:59:39,770 --> 00:59:45,200
It's all publicly available. So you can download these data sets and also data sets on questionnaires and things.

558
00:59:45,210 --> 00:59:49,730
So we've done a lot of different analysis using this data.

559
00:59:50,580 --> 00:59:51,900
So it's very useful.

560
00:59:52,200 --> 01:00:00,180
And you know, for one thing they report back we just the distribution from this among women at the same age to compare our levels in our study.

561
01:00:00,510 --> 01:00:06,200
Again it's a piece of information. So yeah, that's.

562
01:00:06,710 --> 01:00:11,480
And anybody I worked with in Haiti were kind to help clean.

563
01:00:12,350 --> 01:00:24,380
Okay. People use the chemical Dana or other types of that and see first piece first was just used in the sense of okay.

564
01:00:26,970 --> 01:00:30,860
So you guys are experts. You know how to use a computer.

565
01:00:31,590 --> 01:00:34,890
You have to use the weightings and those things. The survey weights and other survey.

566
01:00:35,130 --> 01:00:39,910
Yeah. That has to do with the subgroups that oversample certain subgroups,

567
01:00:39,910 --> 01:00:43,900
then you have to account for that in your analysis if you want to make your results generalize.

568
01:00:46,790 --> 01:00:55,430
Okay. So yeah, how does or is there an advantage to working or disadvantage to working with full data?

569
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:58,100
Why would is make the switch from individual pool data.

570
01:00:59,210 --> 01:01:08,810
Well, some of them, uh, it's the first to so small to the first you on the right there, they switch from individual pool data.

571
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:18,410
Some of these are really expensive to measure. Or maybe they didn't have a large enough sample volume and they combine samples.

572
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:25,520
There's another technique you can use. So that would be part of it.

573
01:01:26,270 --> 01:01:35,180
Um, and sometimes it's based on who has sample volume left, so they have to denote that it's not based on their sampling strategy.

574
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:41,430
So it's probably some mix of both of those things.

575
01:01:42,780 --> 01:01:48,599
I know early in a lot of early years they had trouble getting detectable levels of some of these.

576
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:56,280
So I think they try to increase the rate. Which can be a strategy to if you don't.

577
01:01:57,780 --> 01:02:03,450
Have a short lived chemical, maybe combine samples from repeated batteries and just analyze it once.

578
01:02:04,230 --> 01:02:11,250
Or I've seen case control studies for their pool samples on cases and pool samples while controls and a new comparison.

579
01:02:11,250 --> 01:02:14,670
So pooling is the is a strategy.

580
01:02:15,090 --> 01:02:18,540
But yeah, good question. It's all these dioxins and PCBs.

581
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:22,610
I think it had to do with chemistry. That can be.

582
01:02:26,850 --> 01:02:32,460
Good question. But again, this is a cross-sectional survey, so that's something that is also limiting factor.

583
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:40,590
Put that in the context of what we talked about last time with the bees.

584
01:02:41,250 --> 01:02:49,020
So very different terbium in blood or urine, cobalt mercury peritoneum and for a phenol.

585
01:02:49,410 --> 01:02:58,320
This is comparing the enhanced this is an old in Heinz media with what that means compared to the bee and then the 95th percentile.

586
01:02:58,330 --> 01:03:06,450
And so the upper tail of the distribution, you know, pretty low even compared to what's allowed or what's considered acceptable.

587
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:12,650
But it's a change in the occupational. Again to give some context to the.

588
01:03:14,740 --> 01:03:23,130
Also, you know, academy, you get in there. The exposition.

589
01:03:23,730 --> 01:03:28,170
So you've probably heard about this totality of exposures throughout the lifespan

590
01:03:28,890 --> 01:03:32,280
with security measures of exposure to both chemical non chemical stressors.

591
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:38,940
So the reason I bring this up is biomarkers have been central to this conversation.

592
01:03:40,110 --> 01:03:46,830
For better or for worse. Some people think excuse me is just doing an untargeted metabolomics analysis of a blood sample.

593
01:03:48,060 --> 01:03:55,460
That's not only to find it, but just want to be aware of people using that term and what they're doing right.

594
01:03:59,820 --> 01:04:06,360
So also a lot of discussion of targeted bio monitoring versus untargeted targeted means.

595
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:09,420
You have a list of chemicals you want to measure.

596
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:15,389
You have analytical standards for those specific chemicals and a procedure,

597
01:04:15,390 --> 01:04:21,930
analytical procedure for processing your sample, cleaning the sample, and quantifying the sample for that chemical.

598
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:25,450
That's a targeted approach. That's what they use and hands on.

599
01:04:25,620 --> 01:04:31,050
That's what we use in a lot of our studies. So it provides very accurate and quantitative results.

600
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:36,510
You know what you're measuring, you know what that number is with a lot of confidence.

601
01:04:37,170 --> 01:04:40,320
Disadvantages is your limit to what you want to measure.

602
01:04:40,590 --> 01:04:45,389
And so the enhanced list, you know, several hundred chemicals or as we know,

603
01:04:45,390 --> 01:04:50,250
there's many more chemicals out there, not necessarily that we're exposed to, but potentially exposed to.

604
01:04:50,730 --> 01:04:56,910
So that's a limitation. And they can be labor intensive to do these because they're highly sensitive and specific.

605
01:04:57,870 --> 01:05:01,410
They can be expensive. And she's talking in multiple classes of chemicals.

606
01:05:01,740 --> 01:05:10,110
So has advantages and disadvantages. There's the the blood sample volume requirements and you get to untargeted.

607
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:17,700
Again, this depends on who you ask. A lot of people still have very high hopes for this and I, I do as well.

608
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:22,290
But it has to be done in context. I have people all the time, you know, from.

609
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:28,570
Michigan medicine or whatever that just want to do a study like epidemiologist.

610
01:05:28,580 --> 01:05:33,560
A one question I get all the time is I need an exposure, a validated exposure to chemicals questionnaire.

611
01:05:34,340 --> 01:05:42,620
Like one questionnaire could actually do that. And the other one is we just want to do an untargeted exosome assay and blood.

612
01:05:43,420 --> 01:05:49,840
You know, thinking that that's going to get them everything they need to cover the environmental component of the disease.

613
01:05:50,110 --> 01:05:53,650
Unfortunately, we're not there yet. So some advantages.

614
01:05:53,660 --> 01:05:57,760
You know, you're agnostic. You're just measuring what might be in that sample.

615
01:05:58,060 --> 01:05:59,710
So you could get a lot of different peaks.

616
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:07,240
You know, proponents say this and identify a lot of chemicals that we didn't know people were exposed to before and things like that.

617
01:06:09,140 --> 01:06:13,460
Disadvantages are. Again, it comes down to utility and application.

618
01:06:13,730 --> 01:06:20,060
If you're just detecting a peak, you don't know what that means. Depends on the sample matrix or, you know, if it's blood.

619
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:25,940
A lot of this work with chemicals, like I said, that's not going to be terribly useful potentially in an epidemiologic study because you

620
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:30,680
don't know where on that slope you're falling with regards to when the exposure occurred,

621
01:06:31,820 --> 01:06:37,520
things like that. So has a lot of promise still that but still some disadvantages.

622
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:40,700
You know, when you do a target screen,

623
01:06:40,700 --> 01:06:49,790
a lot of times those endogenous metabolites are at such a higher level than any of these agents metabolites that are kind of controlling that signal.

624
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:54,830
So how do you get those kind of out of the way so you can measure the exogenous?

625
01:06:55,220 --> 01:06:58,970
So there's a lot of lot of work to be done in this as well.

626
01:07:00,260 --> 01:07:04,420
But just wanted to introduce the concept to you. Any questions on how?

627
01:07:11,660 --> 01:07:14,950
It's a couple of case studies here to close out.

628
01:07:15,910 --> 01:07:20,320
Here's one that we show all the time from public health, love and gasoline.

629
01:07:21,070 --> 01:07:25,270
But how did they know that these bio monitoring results over time?

630
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:33,420
So we talked about stats and trends. This can show you on a certain level and what an average before that letter was taken out of gas.

631
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:41,499
And after you show that, you stop. That's an example of a policy being able to document a policy success short of, you know,

632
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:48,220
ideally a policy success would be to show differences in child IQ or whatever the letters is related to on a health.

633
01:07:48,730 --> 01:07:52,600
But that usually is a very long lag and very indirect.

634
01:07:52,810 --> 01:07:59,460
So this is the next best thing to being able to show that clear reduction in exposure to something that we know is harmful.

635
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:06,360
Similar ones from tobacco smoke.

636
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:13,380
So yeah, I remember when I first took this thing about taking the job in Ann Arbor,

637
01:08:14,250 --> 01:08:17,480
I went to like Applebee's or something, and there was a smoking section.

638
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:25,890
Where are we in Ann Arbor. So you guys are too young to remember this, but they used to allow smoking in restaurants and stuff.

639
01:08:26,340 --> 01:08:34,800
So this an environmental tobacco smoker. Secondhand smoke is a big issue in a lot of places, but they started to institute some regulations,

640
01:08:34,890 --> 01:08:38,100
you know, locally and more generally at the state level.

641
01:08:38,550 --> 01:08:46,290
And there's a lot of studies like this that show before and after using biomarkers, very clear differences in exposure.

642
01:08:46,860 --> 01:08:53,220
So that's another good use of bio monitoring.

643
01:08:55,080 --> 01:09:02,580
Here's one showing a success. They banned DDT, the pesticide, and this is samples from breast milk over several decades.

644
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:10,380
You see a clear exponential decrease in that. And this is hopefully what they'll see with PFOA eventually over time.

645
01:09:10,710 --> 01:09:21,270
Same type of curve. Unfortunately, the same type of study found that in breast milk they also starting in the seventies,

646
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:24,690
this is exponential increase in PPD flame retardants.

647
01:09:25,470 --> 01:09:31,230
So again, this use of bio monitoring for status and trends can be useful to show a decrease,

648
01:09:31,230 --> 01:09:36,900
but it can also pick up trends of something that we probably want to pay attention to.

649
01:09:38,260 --> 01:09:44,760
And then, you know, this goes into that whole California thing we talked about last week and things like that.

650
01:09:44,770 --> 01:09:55,830
But. But yeah, this sparked a lot of talk of people to use for for good reason because they seem to be associated with quite a few different things.

651
01:09:57,030 --> 01:10:01,200
Another example is looking at different ways of cooking.

652
01:10:01,380 --> 01:10:08,400
So cookstoves in a lot of countries, not very clean process depending on what they're using.

653
01:10:09,180 --> 01:10:16,410
And this one showed an intervention study where they looked at changing the method,

654
01:10:17,190 --> 01:10:23,970
you know, with a new stove and used biomarkers of carboxyl hemoglobin, which is.

655
01:10:25,140 --> 01:10:35,190
Measure of SEO exposure, as well as one hydroxy pyrethrum, which is a page metabolite and showed significant reductions with this intervention.

656
01:10:35,370 --> 01:10:41,910
Again, very powerful data to show to support decisions like.

657
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:50,550
Chlorpyrifos pesticide working at.

658
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:56,060
Toxicity. So this is the type of study applying to Morton epidemiology setting.

659
01:10:56,420 --> 01:11:01,970
Looking at some pretty fast and cord blood and looking at birth weight, birth length, things like that.

660
01:11:04,190 --> 01:11:12,920
We're getting a phosphate. Pesticides are interesting because there's also a paradox in this enzyme that helps detoxify the chemical.

661
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:16,040
So different people at different levels. A pair of things based on.

662
01:11:17,270 --> 01:11:26,059
Genomics and things that. It can be a biomarker susceptibility that use in combination with the biomarker of exposure that you might

663
01:11:26,060 --> 01:11:33,730
be able to see some stark effect modification of the effects based on that exposure level and that level.

664
01:11:33,740 --> 01:11:36,790
Peroxidase. In addition to that.

665
01:11:36,930 --> 01:11:41,680
So. It's another example. Just a couple over here.

666
01:11:43,780 --> 01:11:48,760
This is interesting to think about. So this environmental working group does a lot of great work,

667
01:11:49,750 --> 01:11:55,900
but sometimes they do some pretty bombastic things, you know, to get attention, which is important.

668
01:11:56,200 --> 01:12:01,630
They get action, right in some ways. So here they took a lot of these methods that we talk about,

669
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:09,070
got to a group of babies and measured a bunch of different chemicals using these techniques

670
01:12:09,070 --> 01:12:15,540
and reported out just how many chemicals are found in the typical person's body,

671
01:12:15,550 --> 01:12:19,930
even newborns. So this was you know, it wasn't the most scientifically designed study,

672
01:12:20,350 --> 01:12:26,710
but it got a ton of press and the headlines were more scary, maybe rightfully so, maybe a little bit overboard.

673
01:12:27,100 --> 01:12:32,500
But it did lead to a lot of more action and probably more of these bio monitoring efforts.

674
01:12:33,780 --> 01:12:41,280
At the state and national level at the. So it's kind of a double edged sword here, but it does have its place in getting things done.

675
01:12:43,530 --> 01:12:52,739
Okay. So in summary biomarkers, very useful, but you do really need to know as much as you can about the biomarker,

676
01:12:52,740 --> 01:12:59,040
about the chemical that's metabolized, what it represents in all these different contexts.

677
01:12:59,670 --> 01:13:03,979
Any questions? All right.

678
01:13:03,980 --> 01:13:10,490
Thanks, guys. So again, let me know if you have questions about your group project topic.

679
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:14,130
Thursday we'll talk about. Consumer products.

680
01:13:14,150 --> 01:13:20,150
And then next week, we'll get into the presentations of your day.

681
01:13:24,180 --> 01:13:27,430
The pros and cons.
