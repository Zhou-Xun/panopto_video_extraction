1
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:05,730
I don't think so. Really?

2
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:12,610
People can the. Okay.

3
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:23,700
The problem. In the giant that we have in my book, you would ask.

4
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:38,490
One problem. Like I was telling, you know, I kind of like have to go have over here and I'm going to go ahead get started.

5
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:43,710
But. Welcome to Section 250.

6
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,000
How you guys doing? Doula. Good.

7
00:00:55,540 --> 00:01:08,769
Okay. Well, go ahead, get started. I welcome you to our second session, and I hope you were able to get a sense and a feel for our first exercise.

8
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:18,280
We will be doing another exercise today, but all of that is really to help you become familiar with the different data sets we're covering.

9
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:22,779
Definitely don't expect you to learn everything in one session, but again,

10
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:30,399
it gives you an opportunity to visit the site and see where the data are stored and just start

11
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:36,610
thinking about ways you can access them in case you want to do this project in the future.

12
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:40,420
So today I'll start with some announcements.

13
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:49,000
The first announcement is that the key to the exercise is already available on canvas for the exercise completed last week.

14
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:53,330
If you are interested that you can take a look and see, you know,

15
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:59,950
if you had anything that was incorrect or if you wanted to see if we have some information that may be different from yours.

16
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:07,270
Also, the recording for those who were not able to attend class last week and even if you were in class,

17
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,609
if you missed something, the recording is posted on the site from last week.

18
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:19,149
So week one and then for next week we will also have another session online.

19
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:26,530
So from the schedule that was presented last week, we already had a session that was scheduled to be online.

20
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:33,010
That's the week of Thanksgiving to give people flexibility to be able to travel if they want to travel, but still enjoying the class.

21
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,989
But for next week,

22
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:44,950
we've got some information from the dean encouraging us to have flexibility in our schedule to allow people to be able to go and vote.

23
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:54,100
So next week will be online. That way you don't have to be spaced, but if you're able to join the session, that would be great.

24
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:59,560
If not, I will record this session and this will be available for you to view.

25
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:08,320
The one limitation with that is that we will be assigning groups next week, so you will start working in groups next week.

26
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:14,380
So I'm hoping the flexibility of not having to be physically will still allow you to participate.

27
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:18,009
But if you're not able to, that's totally understandable.

28
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:20,770
And then you can connect with your group the week after.

29
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:32,260
So to help us remember, I will send a reminder on Tuesday morning of next week to know that we are not going to be in person for our session.

30
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:41,710
I have the Zoom link already in a slice here and it's also available on canvas and will be included in the email that I will send.

31
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:48,850
If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out regarding this or regarding any other concerns.

32
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:53,980
And just to announce that he owned is not yet today. So it's just me.

33
00:03:54,550 --> 00:04:01,110
But she will be joining us next week on. So any questions about the announcements?

34
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:13,610
So I'll plan for today. I will. I would like to review two questions from the exercise from last week.

35
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:20,510
Then I'll introduce vital statistic data and then you will complete the exercise that we have scheduled for today.

36
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:32,540
So one of the questions that some groups did not get correct and I just want to bring this to your attention specifically,

37
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:38,330
because when we're talking about a standardization, we are talking about using a standard population.

38
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:49,310
So this question is asking us to find data that would need to assist this person who is trying to publish a paper on cancer incidence.

39
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:55,790
So some answers did not select the US population.

40
00:04:55,790 --> 00:05:02,749
So some of the answers selected a population different than the US population that the entire US population.

41
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:06,770
So either by state or maybe by US census tract.

42
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:11,180
So just to let you know, this is what your numbers should look like,

43
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:17,300
but the bigger picture is that if you are doing a standardization, you need to be using your standard population.

44
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:25,010
In this case, our standard population is the U.S. So this should have been the option that you should have selected.

45
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:33,290
Any question about a question on. In other situations.

46
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:41,200
If you're comparing a U.S. to a different country, in this case, you will have to use maybe all of stand up population.

47
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:42,250
That's not the U.S.,

48
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:52,280
but you will have to use one that's either a real population generator for the world or one that's being artificially or arbitrarily created.

49
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:58,099
So within the U.S., your center population would be the U.S. But if you're comparing the U.S. to a different country,

50
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:08,680
you will have to use a different population. And then the second question that I just wanted to bring your attention to is the question I asked.

51
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:17,950
If you wanted to get information for 400 participants rather than one person in your study and you wanted to use Geo Polder,

52
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:28,000
how would you go about doing that? In this case, you can do a bash upload, but keep in mind that the file has to be set in a specific way.

53
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:38,979
So there has to be a unique I.D. And then if I individuals in your study the street address city state and then is zip so the acceptable file

54
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:51,070
types you can use or CSV a text file or excel to upload and get the information you need so you wouldn't have to individually enter a 400.

55
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:57,640
Or if your study size is 4000, you wouldn't have to individually enter this information the max.

56
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:05,230
You can have around 10,000 requests per file or you can have the file be restrict that based on the size.

57
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:09,000
So this is just something I wanted to bring to your attention. Okay.

58
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:15,850
Any question about these two questions? All right.

59
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:23,770
So we'll move on to our new topic today, which is us by this statistic Data for health research.

60
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:31,260
So when you think by the statistics, what do you think of what data types are using?

61
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:46,120
Exactly. Birth certificate data, death and then also fetal death.

62
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:53,470
There was a point where marriages and divorces were included, but now that's down to a different survey.

63
00:07:53,890 --> 00:08:03,549
And I think beginning in 1996 was when that process of stop 40 by the statistic program because it's already collected by different surveys.

64
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:08,560
So it was almost collecting the same type of information on two different surveys.

65
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:17,800
So now it's restricted to birth deaths and fetal deaths, specifically fetal deaths over 20 weeks of gestation.

66
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:25,600
Few states, a handful are still states collect fetal deaths for all theories of gestation.

67
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:31,870
But for most states, the limit is 20 weeks of gestation.

68
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:39,410
At least that's the law. And then collecting upwards. So who's collecting these data?

69
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:43,400
These data collected by states and territories.

70
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:51,860
And we have federal law requiring the collection, collation and dissemination of these data.

71
00:08:52,250 --> 00:09:02,750
So the National Biostatistics Program is under the CDC and specifically under the National Center for National Health Statistics.

72
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:13,820
So these data are collected and then combined and then disseminated for us to be able to use, just go into the website and be able to use the data.

73
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:20,190
So what's the process that's involved in the data collection?

74
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:25,770
Because state laws require the birth birth certificate for all live births.

75
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:31,890
This is how we have it mandatory for people to collect information and make it available.

76
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,110
These are usually done based on where people have the baby.

77
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,650
So if it's a hospital, the data will be collected at the hospital.

78
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:49,230
So what information is collected? The birth certificate. Have any of you taking a look at your birth certificate in the recent past?

79
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:55,920
What level of information is collected? Yes.

80
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:01,950
Yes. Name mean? Exactly. Yes. Any other information?

81
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:07,440
I'm sorry. Yes. Date, time and location?

82
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:16,740
Yes. Do you think is more than ten questions that's collected on the birth certificate?

83
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:23,730
Based on the birth certificate that we we usually take home or we request, we need some legal document.

84
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:28,440
It's a one you're shaking your head. You think? Yes, maybe.

85
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:40,110
Well, the legal form that we used to present, maybe if we wanted to get some legal document that if we wanted to get a passport or so,

86
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:47,040
is vastly different from what's called the birth certificate data that's collected for health research.

87
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:53,070
And I'll show you an example. This is what the form looks like.

88
00:10:53,520 --> 00:11:00,740
And I have some. Bigger screens that you'll be able to see a little bit closely.

89
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,479
Which questions I include on an underserved on.

90
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:12,160
The question is what is very detailed information as collect that you collect information on the child, the mother, the father, health information,

91
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:15,850
insurance information, delivery information,

92
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:22,580
all of that you don't see when you see that little legal document that you present if you wanted to get your passport.

93
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:28,300
But there's this whole data collection effort that's associated with birth.

94
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:35,570
Some of the data are collected at the hospital on the day of birth or maybe shortly after birth.

95
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:39,860
But some of the data will be collected during prenatal visits.

96
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:47,690
So if somebody attended most of their prenatal visits, then some of the information will be collected during the course of pregnancy.

97
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:54,919
Now, if somebody they attend any prenatal visits or if they attend a prenatal visit at a different

98
00:11:54,920 --> 00:12:00,500
location and then had a baby at the hospital that's not associated with that clinic,

99
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:08,060
then there's going to be a more intensive effort to collect all of this information around the period immediately after birth.

100
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:14,730
So this is just a close up picture to show you the types of information collected.

101
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:19,860
So a lot of this, that name, date, time of birth, location.

102
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:26,160
But then look for the mom. You have information on the mother's education.

103
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:30,150
Race, fathers education. Also race.

104
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:36,120
And then also information about previous pregnancies for the mom.

105
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:42,650
Cigaret smoking and before. And during pregnancy. And then other information associated with a pregnancy.

106
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:47,489
So risk factors associated with the pregnancy. An exercise that we will do today.

107
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:53,310
You will have an opportunity to see how those different pieces of information that's collected,

108
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:58,320
how they are then available for us to use in our different research projects.

109
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:06,180
Now, a question related to collecting data during pregnancy or at birth.

110
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:11,730
So one example is cigaret smoking during or before pregnancy.

111
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:18,030
How accurate do you think this information is for somebody who's delivering the baby at a hospital?

112
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:31,960
Any thoughts? Thank you.

113
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:40,570
Yes, probably not very accurate. And then the next scenario would be, what if the person had a baby who is either preterm,

114
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:50,710
meaning the baby was born before the expected period of gestation, or if the baby had some sort of ailment at birth?

115
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:55,269
How accurate do you think the information is going to be if the moms what do

116
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:58,360
you think the mom is going to be willing to share information that she smoked?

117
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:07,840
No. So we need to be mindful when we're using cigaret smoking or any data that we are collecting that's not socially desirable,

118
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:11,560
especially in the context of the baby now is not well.

119
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:19,570
We need to be mindful of how accurate those data are and then to take that into consideration when we're using the data.

120
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,070
You know, research questions.

121
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:30,360
So additional information about the newborn, information that you don't see on a legal document that we we take it wrong.

122
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:37,260
But everything that you can think about is collected related to the newborn's health at birth.

123
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:44,640
So the sustainer form and that form was developed in 2003.

124
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:51,690
Not all states jumped on board to start using that form around 2003, but over time,

125
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:59,250
more states joined the effort and now they are using the standard form that was developed in 2003.

126
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:06,120
Keep in mind that if we have states that are not using the same forms,

127
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:13,560
we have some challenges when we're analyzing the data because we might have differences in terms of the information as collected.

128
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:28,460
So in terms of completing the birth certificate information, sometimes it's the doctor who's assisting with the delivery at major hospitals.

129
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:31,880
You have a medical clerk, a birth certificate clerk.

130
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:35,090
So I have my two daughters at the hospital here.

131
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:43,760
And there was a clerk who came with a little cart with information, with papers on the cart and collect the information for me.

132
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:49,950
But I can assure you it definitely wasn't that long list of of information because I had been to prenatal visits.

133
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:53,840
So some of the information was just pulled from the medical records.

134
00:15:55,700 --> 00:16:04,280
The was done. Even if the attending physician does collect the information from you, the attending physician will sign it.

135
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:09,709
And then the information is then sent to the state where it is then compiled and then

136
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:18,470
eventually sent to CDC for creating a national data and then for versatile care at home,

137
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:22,370
which around you have 2% of births in the U.S. occur at home.

138
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:26,900
Either the midwife or attendant will be the one to complete that form,

139
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:32,150
or the parents will complete the form and then file the form to the necessary agency.

140
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:40,480
Any question about birth data before we move on to maternity.

141
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:52,990
Okay. So similar to birth data, state laws also dictate that these eight different information should be filed.

142
00:16:53,740 --> 00:17:02,290
And the requirement is that the death certificate be filed within five days of a death or the discovery of a dead body.

143
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:13,120
And there's a requirement where in a physician, a medical examiner will be the one to complete the certification for the cause of death.

144
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:19,899
This information, once is completed, is then transmitted to the state again.

145
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:27,340
The state collects all of the information and then to send it on to the CDC to be a part of the national biostatistics system.

146
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:35,800
In some instances you might have a death occurring at home. And in that case, the funeral director will file the death certificate.

147
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:41,950
But there was still a need to obtain the medical certification to be able to complete that certificate.

148
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:49,150
So there's still a requirement for now. Similar to the birth certificate process.

149
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:57,160
There's also a form that was developed in 2003, and if you address that, there's a link for you to be able to take a look at the form.

150
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:03,970
Again, states now are using this form going forward.

151
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:08,530
But keep that in mind that sometimes when these forms are generated,

152
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:17,230
states take that one time to buy in and begin and then use those forms as the forms, as the standard forms going forward.

153
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:30,620
No. In order to make comparisons between the classifications done in Michigan compared to various classifications done in California,

154
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:38,420
the international classification of diseases, the coding associated with that, that's what's the use on the death certificate.

155
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:47,180
And this is helpful. So if a person is classified as dying from respiratory failure.

156
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:49,790
There's a certain code, as you saw,

157
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:57,550
people in California using the same code will allow us to be able to document all of the people in the U.S. having seen cool.

158
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:04,190
So it makes it very convenient to be able to use codes that will put people in the same category.

159
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:11,600
Now, if we're using text to describe the cause of death, you have multiple ways that that will be entered.

160
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:17,720
And because of that, when you're trying to analyze the data, it will appear as two different causes of death.

161
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:25,220
One is the same thing because somebody might abbreviate award in there and somebody might spell it out fully.

162
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,570
If you're doing data analysis, you can imagine how challenging that will be,

163
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:36,290
trying to combine data from different locations, different states and different hospitals.

164
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:45,110
So the health departments will use automated software to be able to translate the information into ICD codes.

165
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:50,720
Well, keep in mind, not every description is going to be automatically converted.

166
00:19:51,170 --> 00:20:01,310
So there will be coders who actually go into the data and try to convert the remaining causes of death that when not automatically coded.

167
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:10,400
So far fewer deaths. There's also a state law requiring the reporting of fetal deaths.

168
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:21,650
But also keep in mind that for most states, it's 20 weeks or older gestation, gestational age or 350 grams of birth.

169
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:33,020
Hawaii. California, I think New York are some of the few states that will report any fetal death at any point during pregnancy.

170
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:45,620
Keep in mind that abortions are not included here in elective abortions are not included in the fetal fetuses.

171
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:51,929
So there's also a standard form that's available at that link.

172
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:58,020
If you want to take a look, you can take a look and see the different information that's collected on the form.

173
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:05,810
So the different sources that are available for national statistic data,

174
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:10,490
you can go to CDC wonder, which is where we're going to be doing our exercise today.

175
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:15,650
Or you can use the National Death Index where you have information on deaths.

176
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,930
The national debt in this can be very helpful.

177
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:25,970
So sometimes you have a large cohort study that you might be running and you are following people for a period of time.

178
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:29,840
But the process can be very expensive.

179
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:36,860
So sometimes you can collect information on individuals as a part of your study activity,

180
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:44,090
and then you can go to the National Death Index and connect your study participants to the National Debt Index.

181
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:51,050
With that, you are able to determine who from your study has died and you can get information on the cost of that.

182
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:58,280
So that's a little bit cheaper than following people for such a long period of time and then trying to get information on outcome.

183
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:03,200
So this is one way. This is a process that's going on independent of other studies.

184
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:09,650
But you can connect the data if you have unique ID in this case, if you have to just carry a number.

185
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:18,200
And then as we mentioned last week, National Vital Statistic System has data that you can download.

186
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,150
So individual level data.

187
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:30,950
Last we talk about census, where you have aggregate data and you're able to get information for a certain area before the CDC wander off site.

188
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:38,530
You can get individual level data. So it's not identifiable data, but you can get individual level data to do your analysis.

189
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,620
So some of the ways that we can use vital statistic data in health research,

190
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:58,110
we can connect our major cohorts to the National Death Index again to understand who's still alive from people in your study.

191
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:10,530
Or you can use the birth data to understand how births are changing in the U.S. You know, are mothers getting younger or mothers getting older?

192
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:16,890
And then also, you can use these data to understand the leading causes of death in the U.S.

193
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:23,610
Any question about national vital statistics data and this brief overview?

194
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:34,880
So I'll give you an example of work that I did using a national by the statistic system.

195
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:40,610
So I'm interested in air pollution exposure and I'm also interested in preterm birth.

196
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:46,280
So we looked at air pollution exposure and preterm birth in two cities.

197
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:57,290
So keeping my air pollution exposure data that I obtained these data from the EPA system, so it's a separate dataset.

198
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:05,480
But because of the available availability of data, we are able to link data from one source to another.

199
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:10,010
So I'll walk you through the process of what was done in our study.

200
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:13,700
So you understand how we can use these data.

201
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:22,280
You can link the data with a different source, or you can use the data just based on the national biostatistics system.

202
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:24,770
You don't have to link it to another data source.

203
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:34,940
So the motivation for this study is that environmental pollution is unevenly distributed by location and race in the U.S.,

204
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:41,690
and it contributes to the burden of preterm birth, especially in some communities.

205
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:49,810
So the objective here was to evaluate the association between living in two cities with different air pollution classifications.

206
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:55,760
And I'll tell you a little bit more about that. And the percent of live births that were preterm among African American women.

207
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:07,310
So a little bit of background. Preterm birth is usually evaluated in studies looking at white versus black or maybe looking at two different races.

208
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:12,499
But that sometimes can be a little bit difficult to understand why we're seeing

209
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:15,650
these differences in the rates of preterm birth between the two groups,

210
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:23,360
because as soon as we do two different groups, then we say is something unique to that group that's leading to the differences in preterm birth rates.

211
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:30,530
So this study focused only on African-American women, but focus on African-American women in two different locations.

212
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:34,350
So a little bit of background for preterm birth.

213
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:43,770
Preterm birth is birth occurred before 37 weeks of gestation and the usual line of gestation is around 40 weeks.

214
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:52,260
So babies born before 37 weeks of gestation usually have some difficulties, sometimes as an immediate period after birth,

215
00:25:52,500 --> 00:26:00,720
but sometimes it can be pretty extensive and remain true out life, sometimes throughout childhood.

216
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:10,080
And then sometimes some of the adverse effects or consequences associated with preterm birth can go beyond the immediate generation.

217
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:18,659
So it's a leading cause of perinatal mortality, and efforts aimed at prevention have not had a major impact.

218
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:25,770
And you will see when I show you the data on preterm birth it and there are major differences by race and location.

219
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:33,520
So prison break is associated with adult and adverse child health outcomes.

220
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:43,150
So for maternal health, for women who deliver a preterm birth baby, they are at higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease later in life.

221
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:50,110
They are also associated with offspring health, with increased risk of diabetes,

222
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:56,980
obesity and cardiovascular disease among the offspring who were delivered at preterm.

223
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,240
And then there's the intergenerational impacts.

224
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:09,010
So people who were born preterm have a higher risk of delivering a preterm baby themselves.

225
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:16,420
So this is something that not only happens within one generation, it has impacts beyond one generation.

226
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:26,200
So the image here shows inflammation on preterm birth rates in the U.S. from 2007 to 2020.

227
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:32,350
And you can see it's kind of hovered over around 10% throughout the years.

228
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:42,610
There was a little dip in the metro area here, but it's still primarily stay around greater than 9.5%.

229
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:51,370
And then the data here also indicate preterm birth, what it was early preterm birth or late preterm birth.

230
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:56,680
And we have more of our preterm birth cases happening and more late preterm birth,

231
00:27:57,250 --> 00:28:09,310
which is a little bit better because you have fewer or less severe outcomes among babies born who are classified as late preterm.

232
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:14,769
Earlier, preterm birth is where you have more severe consequences.

233
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:21,610
So death, developmental delays, everything that you can think about does negatively associate that with preterm birth.

234
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:25,600
Woke her among babies who would reach her early preterm.

235
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:38,040
So preterm birth by race. And we have data for 2019 and in 2000, 2020, we have the data presented by different groups.

236
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:44,110
So all of our races in the U.S., non-Hispanic, white, non-Hispanic, black and Hispanic.

237
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:49,260
And then on the x axis, you have the percent of preterm births.

238
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:58,690
So you see for all races, which is similar to the image shown to slice, our goal is around 10%.

239
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:07,629
So for 2019, 10.23 and then for 2020 10.09% for non-Hispanic whites,

240
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:17,530
you see is less than the national average, which is 9.26% for 2019 and then 2020 9.1%.

241
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:24,190
So we also have information year for early versus late preterm birth.

242
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:31,030
And you see a similar picture from what we have for the national average for non-Hispanic black women.

243
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:41,800
You see that the rate is 14.3, 94 and 2090 and in 2020, also 14 for this time, 14.36.

244
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:49,770
We see that for early preterm birth, the rates there almost doubled for early preterm birth.

245
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:55,480
And we know that's where we had the more severe outcomes for babies born preterm.

246
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:04,690
And then for Hispanics, you have that coming closer to the rates for non-Hispanic white and definitely lower than the national average.

247
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:16,649
So for our study we use birth data, phone and National Vital Statistics system for the year 2000 for we restricted analysis

248
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:23,230
to Singleton pregnancy because the additional risk factors associated with multiples.

249
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:30,390
So we restricted the analysis to singleton pregnancies and then we utilize air quality data from the U.S. EPA.

250
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:37,080
And we conducted a two way comparison for preterm birth among African-American women in Ann Arbor and Detroit.

251
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:48,030
So we used Ann Arbor because we knew that we had different air pollution exposures in Iowa versus Detroit.

252
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:52,920
And we're trying to aim for a contrast in air pollution exposure.

253
00:30:53,580 --> 00:31:01,380
So we use the WILCOXON signed rate test to compare the AQI for Ann Arbor and Detroit.

254
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:05,969
And then we use Chi Square test to compare preterm birth by geographic location.

255
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:15,960
So Detroit versus in other. So the average of PM 2.5 associated AQI with different 42 cities.

256
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:26,790
And because of that, we use that information to classify in other as having low open exposure, which is an air pollution measure compared to Detroit.

257
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:34,800
So we had a total of 10,523 eligible births among African-American women.

258
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:42,300
10,361 of those births occurred in Detroit, and then 162 occurred in other.

259
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:49,749
So preterm birth among African-American women in Detroit was 17.6%,

260
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:58,120
so even higher than the national average that I reported previously, compared to 8% in other.

261
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:07,360
So this is very interesting because when we look at air pollution, not air pollution, preterm birth by race, we see differences.

262
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:14,860
And then those differences, we are quick to maybe mistakenly make the conclusion that the differences might be due to race.

263
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:16,000
But in this case,

264
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:26,110
we are looking at only African American women and we see that the rate is more than double between women in Detroit compared to in other.

265
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:33,250
And this difference we found it was statistically significant based on the Chi Square test.

266
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:41,500
So our conclusions based on this is that comparing to cities with significantly different IQ eyes,

267
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:46,060
we found differences in the percent of preterm birth among African-American women.

268
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:51,579
And these results kind of indicate that there are other factors,

269
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:58,750
important factors that may be playing a role in the differences that we see in preterm birth rates among people,

270
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:09,850
depending on which location they're in. So additional studies are needed because we were missing information on key confounders and

271
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:15,460
then maybe additional studies may be necessary to further evaluate what we found in this study.

272
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:21,260
So what are some of the advantages of primary data collection?

273
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:30,010
We were able to use a large data set.

274
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:36,980
Just go straight to the website and download the data, understand the data, and then be able to make out and do our analysis.

275
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:43,640
For primary data collection, we are able to ask specific questions.

276
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:49,880
We are able to ask the questions as we intended, compared to what's collected on the birth certificate data.

277
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:55,820
And then the investigator can select the population of interest and decide what of some of the

278
00:33:55,820 --> 00:34:03,770
inclusion and exclusion criteria the limitations are from primary data collection include is costly,

279
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:14,059
is time consuming, and this potentially limitation is associated with a small sample size compared to the national

280
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:20,570
biostatistics system will able to go and get a large dataset with more than 10,000 participants.

281
00:34:20,930 --> 00:34:27,200
So that's something that's not going to be so common when you are collecting primary data.

282
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:34,000
So the strengths and limitations of using publicly available data.

283
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:44,200
So we saw with strength were able to use a large sample and allow us to focus only on African-American women to control for the influence of race.

284
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:53,230
Compared to a far smaller study we may have had a smaller sample, wouldn't have been able to make that specific selection.

285
00:34:54,190 --> 00:35:02,230
The data are readily available and we are able to download the data and, you know, use multiple years of use 24 to 26.

286
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:07,570
But for this analysis it was just one year and then limitations.

287
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:12,720
We use annual PM 2.5 data to classify.

288
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:21,820
You should see. So with a primary data collection, or maybe we would have had more specific information on participants in a study.

289
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:32,059
So the conclusion for VAC by the statistic data availability is that it's a useful source for

290
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:37,910
us to use readily available data that can be used to evaluate a range of research questions.

291
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:46,340
And these data can be useful for informing policy regarding key health indicators in the country.

292
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:54,080
Any questions about a biostatistics data? All right.

293
00:35:55,550 --> 00:36:04,040
So just so you know, for next week, we are going to be covering and he so as the National Health and Nutritional Assimilation Survey.

294
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:11,960
Then we will also introduce the final project and then group assignments will be announced next week.

295
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:21,240
So with that, I invite you to go to canvas and then download the exercise for today.

296
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,370
And as a reminder,

297
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:35,340
each group should upload a single document so it makes it easier for us to quickly review and highlight any questions that were incorrect.
