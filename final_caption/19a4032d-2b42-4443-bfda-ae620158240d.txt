00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:08,580
When I first took the six Americas quiz at the start of EHS 596,

2
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:14,640
I was surprised to learn that I only fall into the concerned category, not the alarmed category.

3
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:20,730
This was alarming for me as the president of the Public Health Sustainability Initiative at the School of Public Health,

4
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:31,140
because I am supposed to be an advocate for sustainability on campus and awareness of climate change and its impacts on all our communities.

5
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:37,560
Safe to say I'm alarmed now. Our four weeks of the course have looked at not only climate change.

6
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,480
The science behind it.

7
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:51,350
Its impacts, but that these impacts are now are current and are affecting marginalized and historically disadvantaged communities across the world.

8
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:59,750
Beyond just this pessimism, though, one of my favorite attributes of this course was outlining actions that we can take in local communities now.

9
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:07,550
I like to think of this as global goals, but local levels and local impacts.

10
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:17,780
These include mitigation and adaptation plans and evaluation to understand how local systems are impacted by climate change,

11
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:25,600
whether this be heat, island effects, flooding or other causes.

12
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,910
Finally, we are ending with a look towards an application for new science,

13
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:38,470
for new solutions and to be advocates for climate policy to take advantage of the opportunities that we are given.

14
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:51,250
However inadvertent, while this is all gone in parallel with this covert set of expectations to develop communication skills,

15
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:59,230
we have worked extensively to communicate not only to other professionals and to practice communicating in class,

16
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:07,390
but to develop communication for the public and for the communities we serve and hope to impact and make a difference in.

17
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:10,480
This is really prepared me to be an advocate moving forward,

18
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:15,520
and I feel this will or my other and my fellow classmates to be advocates moving forward as well,

19
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:23,890
to spearhead local actions in the communities we serve and to ensure that we are always aware of and

20
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:31,120
working to address the climate change injustices that are occurring to achieve climate justice.

21
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:38,050
Again, I am alarmed now, but I know that myself and others who have taken this course and others across the nation

22
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:44,440
are taking action to reduce these climate injustices and to make a better future.

23
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,016
Thank you.
