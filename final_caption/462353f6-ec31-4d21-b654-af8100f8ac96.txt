1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:11,820
Okay. Welcome.

2
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:18,840
So, first of all, happy new year. Happy with a relaxing break.

3
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:24,430
My name is Alex. Wake up and I will be teaching this class.

4
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,320
Microbial control, sterilization, disinfection, manipulation.

5
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:35,190
This class actually is about ten years old, but it stopped for a while and asked me starting again.

6
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:36,959
And last year was the first year we started.

7
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:53,220
So actually I'm thinking new things in new ideas and actually trying to build a host of elements as well as suggestions from last semester.

8
00:00:53,220 --> 00:01:02,430
So we would like to go for from today onwards is to have a very genius interaction between all of us.

9
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:08,250
Let me know what you like, what you don't like. I'm totally open to this. I love this class and it's actually fantastic.

10
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:12,870
And and we want to see how to make it better for following years.

11
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:16,260
Okay. That's not to say it would be good this time around. It's going to be great.

12
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:20,100
I hope so. But I really would like the feedback as we go along.

13
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:23,739
And the other thing to make sure we won't be going down that you mentioned again

14
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:31,740
in my slides is that I'm kind of glad you chose this room because I in previous

15
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:38,459
years go back before COVID seems like so long ago that we used to be in a room

16
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:43,260
with a big round table and all the students used to get around them as well.

17
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:50,100
And I used to beat up the Knights of the Round Table. And actually we have a round table, but just have an extra activity outside.

18
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,510
What I mean by knights, the round table. I really like a bit of history.

19
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:59,850
Why do we do that? Even though you might so hear the English accent in me?

20
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:05,610
Actually, I'm from Cornwall, about Cornwall and England. That's where King Arthur was supposedly from.

21
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:11,040
And so I was very intrigued as a young about how people used to be around the round table,

22
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:16,620
the knights and everyone was treated equally and everyone had a voice.

23
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:23,489
And that's the bit that I want to really encourage in here. Okay, I've just put Panopto on.

24
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:30,090
I would I don't really want to do Panopto want to encourage everyone to come in so those that can't make it, I'll make it available for those.

25
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:34,560
But I really want to discussion kind of thing going on is the British me.

26
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:45,550
I apologize, but I really like to have back and forth chatting but in a very positive and accepting way I do about my type,

27
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:51,120
my diversity equity inclusion bit in a minute, but I'm still getting around round it.

28
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:55,979
So with that, welcome. Let's get started.

29
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,340
And today I thought first that I would introduce me.

30
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:08,610
So some of you know me, very many of you may not know me and I thought we good to give you a background of who is this guy teaching this class,

31
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:14,220
what is his qualifications? Why should you be teaching it and where is he coming from?

32
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:22,290
And I should warn you have come with props. So we have props and we actually had one already provided for us in the classroom.

33
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:25,950
I saw this is multipurpose disinfecting wipes. We'll get to that later.

34
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:30,210
And also about some of you. You've already emailed me about books.

35
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,500
I do not want you to look for this book. I do not want you to buy any books.

36
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:40,709
I'm going to provide you scans, PDFs, websites, the whole lot I'm very aware of.

37
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:44,760
Books can be really expensive, actually brutally honest.

38
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:51,840
This class will do will cover the gambit going back to believer and not like 2000

39
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,390
B.C. literature going all the way forward to basically the last couple of years.

40
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:02,610
Okay, books won't cover. That's not the whole gambit.

41
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:06,780
So what I want to do is just give you pieces as we go.

42
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:14,879
Now, I also am very aware that I had done everything down slides, papers, points at the get go.

43
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:19,560
I don't want to do that. First reason, I am actually developing this class as we go.

44
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:27,030
So actually I've got slides lined up. The whole thing is good to go, but I want to add things based upon discussions and I'll get to that in a minute.

45
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:30,780
I view the syllabus as an organic document.

46
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:36,840
That's to say, I want to stick to what I've got, but I can plug things in, I can move things around,

47
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:42,240
I can turn one thing down or integrate it into the other, because that makes sense.

48
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,470
And that actually is for you. That's for me.

49
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:51,150
And that is the reason why I wanted to make it my background because our time quite nicely.

50
00:04:51,300 --> 00:05:01,170
Okay, so my background, I mean, I was born and raised there but traveled a lot because my family traveled quite a bit.

51
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:10,870
But I did my bachelor's at the University of Birmingham back in my goodness time for boy time this flight and it's really amazing.

52
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:16,690
1993 to 1996 and I focused on some microbiology and immunology.

53
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:21,120
I then decided, you know what vaccine? A coup, but I'm out of the plants.

54
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,509
So I went to Stanford studying plants and actually doing quantitative genetics.

55
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:34,330
So, for example, if you know where plants, which are many of living organisms, have multiple genes controlling a given trait.

56
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:40,750
And actually through time later in the class, if we think about one gene, one trait, E-flux publishing, you know that.

57
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,490
But actually even multiple genes can contribute to the overall property of that giving thing.

58
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:49,180
And so I was very much interested in that, and that's quantitative trait loci.

59
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,770
And then I realized that doing the work that we did on tissue culture,

60
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:58,240
plant tissue culture that hang on a second, always getting bacteria or contamination.

61
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:02,110
Well, if you can't beat them, join them. Hello?

62
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:06,490
Come on in. Welcome. Just got started.

63
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:15,670
So if you can't beat them, join them. So then I went on to do a Ph.D. in microbiology at the University of Manchester.

64
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:22,570
What is University Premier and University of Manchester have in common? Well, I will tell you now, big warning.

65
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:28,750
I'm a big movie buff. And when I look at those two institutions, I can't help but think of Harry Potter.

66
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:32,890
They were cool. Redbrick institutions, gothic architecture.

67
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:44,770
Anyway, so I moved on and did microbiology there, and that was focused on freshwater microbiology, looking at how bacteria interact with each other.

68
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:50,020
And that's all about biofilms. And that's where my interest suddenly just exploded.

69
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:55,220
And the idea that microorganisms don't just float around us, they adhere to surfaces.

70
00:06:55,240 --> 00:07:03,650
In fact, this morning, if you did the right thing, the dentist tells you, do you brush your teeth, you play with this wonderful mask, it's coming.

71
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:09,700
A mouth brush my teeth. That's a biofilm. I'm going to talk more about this in this class and how we actually treat it.

72
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:14,290
And that may be simple. Hello.

73
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:18,820
Mouthwash and toothpaste do again. That was classic something using props already.

74
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:28,719
Then I move from there being interested in bathrooms and how to baptize in this class with more treat those baths and how to control them,

75
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:36,510
how to manipulate them. And that was actually working in the research from the School of Pharmacy at the University of Manchester under a professor,

76
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:43,870
but sadly passed away a few years ago but was one of the greats.

77
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:48,100
I will safely say that I've seen a lot.

78
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:57,400
It is because I've been standing on the shoulders of giants and he was a giant and I went to basics to make sure we did a homage to him in this class.

79
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:07,330
Many decades of we said, really pioneered a interesting recession understanding and to call territory ammonium compounds and we'll focus

80
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:15,100
a lot on that could 30 million compounds for example are in Ashley We were classrooms so cleaning surfaces.

81
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:23,470
So we'll get to that. And then after our submission that was funded by my patient post-docs, I was funded by SC Johnson.

82
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,400
Full Disclosure had a fund who had lots of companies funding my lab.

83
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:34,840
I've been in labs have been funded, a lot of companies as well. So full disclosure that you name them pretty much, you know,

84
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:42,399
Proctor and Gamble have always been consumer companies have had funding or been allowed to see funding from them.

85
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:47,800
But I don't see a problem that most that research is now finished actually we should be talking about.

86
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:54,340
So yeah, then I once actually had a really great conversation,

87
00:08:54,340 --> 00:09:00,400
very interested in how my courses into antimicrobial resistance, how they develop, how they develop these resistances.

88
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:08,229
And I was fortunate to get to know another giant Paul Callan brand that Paul CONAN Binder was a National Institutes of Health.

89
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:15,550
He sadly passed away as well, but has left a fantastic legacy as a group of us around the world.

90
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:24,490
Patricia Diaz, she's at Buffalo right now. Nicholas Jakabovics, he's in Sheffield, which I thought was so Newcastle.

91
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:31,030
Whole load of us spread out throughout the world, like his legacy, if you will.

92
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:35,979
And he was interested in how microbes interact with each other physically and chemically.

93
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:41,740
We'll get to that as well, because that has importance for what we're talking about.

94
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:53,410
This class then ended up going to a Department of Biology and was mainly situated in the track of ecology at State University of New York, Binghamton.

95
00:09:54,040 --> 00:10:01,630
And then from there, I think the gains have gone from sort of microbiology, immunology, applied genetics, microbiology, pharmacy.

96
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:05,480
See Data ecology epidemiology.

97
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:14,450
Now you can see what's going on here. So I'm tying all this micro knowledge now to bring it more to the masses of the masses of people to

98
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:21,770
understand how we have control of microbes and prevent infections to to use them for public good.

99
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:31,129
And that's what going to be coming along this class. And this note is by no accident that the word control and manipulation in the course title,

100
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:37,900
because we're going to start thinking beyond our current solar century concepts of microbial use.

101
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:44,120
So last century, we were to have a better word, warmongers on microorganisms.

102
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:46,710
Okay, we're going to talk about that, you know,

103
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:54,110
try to kill these microorganisms to try and prevent disease and maybe we can trick them to do other things of that nature.

104
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:04,550
Okay. And so I've been here as an assistant professor and then got tenure as associate professor because lots of papers and patents,

105
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:14,540
great things that have my lab and lots of teams that works in my lab that actually worked in these papers and patterns and get funding from federal,

106
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:20,780
state society and corporate sponsors and even multi-lateral research actually with applied focus on bias and control.

107
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:30,440
And this didn't really push that point. You've done a biofilm is a biofilm is an aggregate accumulation of microorganisms at a surface, a grubbing.

108
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:38,600
And as a consequence of living in this state, they have very different properties compared to when they're floating around.

109
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:46,160
Okay. And I would argue that each one of you in this room right now are walking, talking backs of biofilms.

110
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:52,070
Okay. Nice. I like to say that I so many reasons why.

111
00:11:52,100 --> 00:12:00,640
First up, I look at each you look at myself. And as you count up the number of bacterial cells versus the number of human cells, which one wins?

112
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:07,700
I do bacteria. Okay. If you count the number of unique genes, bacteria win again.

113
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,810
Okay. There's a very close relationship.

114
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:23,510
And as humans, we have often thought is actually in the press is kind of we jumped on this in terms a bad way that those microorganisms out to get us.

115
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,930
We are really just there.

116
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:37,990
And many times is due to the microbes interacting with each other and taking opportunities and sometimes even for yourselves,

117
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:43,820
as being scorched earth between interactions with microorganisms, chronic wounds being one of those examples.

118
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:48,440
Chronic wounds. We don't get much healing because there's a battle between microbes using locally microbes and the.

119
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:53,150
Host Okay, and we get into that and how we can potentially disrupt that.

120
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,790
So alluding to this slide, actually loads of things down here.

121
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:04,460
These are things that I want to cover in the class and this is what I'm going to open up to you.

122
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:17,210
And you feel free if you don't want to talk in here, but you will instead want to email me to find a that is to really cater to your interest as well.

123
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:20,840
I think if I showed you that, I've got a very broad background. Okay.

124
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:27,560
There's a heavy focus on biofilms. Heavy focus on antimicrobial resistance.

125
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:32,390
Heavy focus. We work with companies and new products and new ways to try and control microorganisms.

126
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:37,700
And so I'd very much like your input if you want me to bring other things in.

127
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:44,450
Okay. We'll get to that in a little while. Heads up so you can pay yourself and ask each morning a little while to introduce yourself to the group.

128
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:46,370
And I'll get back to a minute.

129
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:53,120
The whole point of the roundtable member beginning instead of getting off the mountain table, we are all equal to all of you having input.

130
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:58,340
I only have a few a few minutes. So let's look at this for a quick second.

131
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:02,780
What have I put here? Superbugs. Kind of daunting word.

132
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:07,099
Anything intimidating word? Being used a lot these days.

133
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:13,550
And the desperate need for antibiotics. Was in Time magazine, New Yorker.

134
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:20,090
Drug resistant bacteria of thousands in the U.S. I think this is a it's a New York Times article.

135
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:29,030
Very worrisome statements. I have to admit, some of these I took and I have an original slide before COVID.

136
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:31,910
And obviously that's kind of tempered now with what's been going on with COVID.

137
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:38,540
But just because we've had a vibe, a pandemic with a virus, does it mean we've got these other things to worry about as well?

138
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:43,580
And many of the antimicrobials that we'll be discussing have antiviral properties as well.

139
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:50,600
Okay. But even so, we think about how many people die from simple infections due to pacemaker,

140
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:55,969
infections due to all these sort of things due to implant related infections,

141
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:59,390
chronic disease related to periodontal disease, for example, if you guys know this.

142
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:07,060
But if you have bad oral health. Is there an increased chance that not only we have loss of teeth of carries,

143
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:11,830
but open wounds and makes it, but also the bacteria to spread to other areas in your body?

144
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,879
Prime example we use an organ in our lab called Streptococcus.

145
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:22,030
Go down the idol one and I think you might know this, but I will just have, you know, maybe shock a little bit.

146
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:27,940
DL one As she's known its original name it was originally called streptococcus good

147
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:32,680
only I Charice White Shanice It was the name of the person that died from it.

148
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:43,150
Okay. Charice was the person that bad thing had bad or ill health and that organism was found how got infected endocarditis.

149
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:49,810
So that dental exam traveled around his body and formed a bottom of his heart and killed that person.

150
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:56,350
Obviously, nowadays we don't like to name things after people have passed away, so we changed the name.

151
00:15:56,350 --> 00:16:03,220
Actually, people who argue that what the name changes day one B to A to C, H one, but it's the same organism.

152
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:09,990
It's happening to hear biofilms, certainly to talk about biofilms around it,

153
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:16,510
introduce that word to you, introduce the term, what actually happens and why is it a problem?

154
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:26,770
Okay. A lot of work in the last few decades stems from what my bill costs and bill costs and the first person to coin the word biofilms.

155
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:35,590
And he he really to help the medical community on its edge,

156
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:44,319
because he was kind of a very unique person where he would do a mixture of environmental microbiology,

157
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:51,010
medical microbiology, technological studies, and he believes in what he saw in streams.

158
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:57,100
So if you've ever been to Montana, you have those hotbed water streams, the microbial mats, you've seen those.

159
00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:05,620
But that goopy stuff that's coming off, you get you see normal streams in the springtime, especially if you have a gooey stuff on box.

160
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:12,010
He said, that's a biofilm. And by the way, when you have a orthopedic implant, for example, when it fails,

161
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:19,960
which is goopy stuff on the implant hidden in have put an outline that's a boxer and he was the one that made him go, whoa.

162
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,590
And he used the word biofilm to,

163
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:30,520
to unify our thoughts and bring the scientific community together and to make us realize that actually that's a big issue.

164
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:38,379
We talked about antimicrobial resistance. Think how big an issue and I'll say this and this many times it's been estimated

165
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:47,770
that a bio bacterium in a biofilm is approximately 1000 times less susceptible,

166
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:53,640
more recalcitrant and more tolerant to an anti-microbial in the present 2115 an hour.

167
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:58,730
Now, think about that for a second. If you have a bottom in your body, okay.

168
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:05,410
And that microorganisms in that can cause, you know, can release toxins, something like that.

169
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:13,330
Okay. You need a thousand times more anti antimicrobial to get it.

170
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,810
Let me ask, my crew was actually talking to us. We had to go above therapeutic levels.

171
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:27,670
You can't do that. And that's why in many instances you have to have the, um, the implant removed.

172
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:33,010
Okay. That is why you have to thoroughly clean surfaces.

173
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:38,560
That's why some antimicrobials fail. Okay, I'll go over this again, but I want to set the scene.

174
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:44,260
Okay. We're actually going to have one fogging. So, yes, you might see this people.

175
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:49,329
What are your own spraying? Things spraying. And you might think I killed Microorganism.

176
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:56,110
Yeah. Yes, it is primarily used for surfaces. And we talk about what that actually achieves and it's used in hospitals, for example, but in hospitals.

177
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:00,670
Food processing plants. Yes, we can talk about food processing plants.

178
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:09,470
We actually could talk about all sorts of things. We're going to go from the home to workplace, the dental office, the hospital.

179
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:12,070
Industry.

180
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:19,870
So looking at agriculture, we're actually going to be looking at companies that have actually been developing new strategies to control microbes,

181
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:26,150
companies that are using microorganisms to produce enzymes, compounds that we use.

182
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:36,230
Companies are actually using microbes as probiotics, and we know probiotics against a probiotic is as an organism that encourages health.

183
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:42,860
That level right now works down the tool, super cool stuff like, um,

184
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:50,360
actually got in here all the approaches and how we develop new compounds and new products.

185
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:55,190
And I relate this to patenting as well. And the last so I should mention good news.

186
00:19:55,190 --> 00:20:01,099
There's no final exam in this class. What there is, it's a lot of flash on previous years we've done this.

187
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:06,889
I want this center for research, learning and teaching S.A.T. many years ago, not this idea.

188
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:08,510
Back in time, within a few times.

189
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:18,770
The idea would be that you will give out search, patent databases, Google, PubMed and a new technology and look for applications.

190
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:22,370
And you think you could actually use that technology for and have got a paper on?

191
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:28,100
That is really good advice, of course, but I think you like it.

192
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:34,580
Absolutely. Oh, so we're talking microorganisms. I'm sure you've also heard that, hey,

193
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:41,060
she's a little bit good to get dirt on you and not have this completely this atmosphere where you go anti-microbial soaps and things like this.

194
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:44,270
So we told you about that as well. Toothpaste.

195
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:52,220
So dental Clorox surface is how and why they're hoping resistance is an issue

196
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:58,160
and what is a difference between a anti-microbial antibiotic and a biocides?

197
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:05,060
Do you guys know that it's actually ridiculously confusing and lucky.

198
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:08,650
We're still arguing over independence in the future, and so I try and cover a bit of that.

199
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:11,750
And if we get to today, great. If not, we start again.

200
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:21,170
But this first lecture today is literally to get me to get too excited to meet and greet, and then next time around, get started properly.

201
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:24,560
Okay. We must celebrate today then to having five again.

202
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:28,760
I have a question. Seven. Okay.

203
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:35,180
Watch the course summary. This is straight off from campus.

204
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:42,440
So because this semester I think the campus is so developed in spite of antibiotic resistant microcosms,

205
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:49,670
increasing pressure is being applied to improve hygiene procedures in the home workplace and especially medical and dental situations.

206
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:57,440
Okay. So that's kind of alluded to the last few slides as such emphasis being applied to reinvigorates and improving sterilization

207
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:03,920
and disinfection practices have a much these mechanistic knowledge behind replication I suspect is often disregarded.

208
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:10,640
That is a big issue, especially if you are going to go into public health field because she was derma stand.

209
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:15,770
Why they do things and what is important or maybe what is not so important is it makes sense.

210
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:22,459
So if we get into my system of public health and an appreciation of such information

211
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:25,800
could again prove the implementation of strategies to control infection,

212
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:32,960
improve hygiene. As such, this collection focus on the chemical and physical technologies that they will be useful.

213
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:36,410
I should actually also mention biological as well.

214
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:43,069
Okay. Chemical explains that because of a microorganism doing both and supporting as well,

215
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:49,700
it aims to give students the knowledge to be informed and inform other public health practitioners as to appropriate and effective use.

216
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:59,299
Took care to include types of antimicrobial agents, types of physical agents to control microbial communities, mechanisms of resistance.

217
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:02,330
And I don't like this word resistance. I'll get to that later.

218
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:06,020
Resistance means different things to different people as well.

219
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:13,190
I mentioned already that I like movies.

220
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,899
You'll pick this up later.

221
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:23,300
When we start talking about this, there's actually a really interesting tie in here where you can see resistance, the python resistance paradigm.

222
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:28,010
What is the big issue going on here? Why are companies backing out from making new antibiotics?

223
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:36,860
They wouldn't go on idealism. It would be a diminishing return to return spot on.

224
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:45,410
And actually what they doing is being right now that, hey, because bacteria becoming more and more resistant to becoming quicker to become resistant,

225
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:49,910
why should we as a company make a new antibiotic that we use this in five years?

226
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:56,390
Let's instead make a new hand cream or a drug that treats treats migraines.

227
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:03,940
Right. So getting to this and that is a big issue and we'll be certainly talking about that as well.

228
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:11,500
Evaluation of anti-microbial efficacy. So how do we understand?

229
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:13,570
How do we describe?

230
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:21,940
How do we get an idea how effective and anti-microbial will be in the real world based upon lab studies or doing some clinical study?

231
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:32,080
And there are huge problems here, both at the experimental level, but also at the federal level as well.

232
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:36,040
So what does the FDA, the EPA, say about all of this?

233
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:43,270
We touched upon that as well. Okay. I've really tried to put a lot into this class over the years and trying to make it so

234
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:47,790
everyone will get some definition of things that may be interesting more than other things.

235
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:54,250
So everyone's touching different things of interest. The use of anti-microbial certification in practice.

236
00:24:54,970 --> 00:25:02,410
So for example, I will be talking about actually a dental piece where she's actually a terrifying story.

237
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:05,110
She is have multiple times actually,

238
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:13,540
where dentists have not been sterilizing their instruments properly and there have been incidents of people getting infected.

239
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:17,340
And I'll keep it at that level until you this.

240
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:21,429
Yeah. And we'll get. Well I'm smiling. It's it's terrible.

241
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:24,640
But it's also a really interesting story.

242
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:34,840
And really, we will be learning about some cool things that we need to address as public health practitioners,

243
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:39,480
but also going forward and part of using small resources went into the next one.

244
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:44,500
If we're coming up, new and emerging technologies, this bit is I think,

245
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:50,500
the coolest part of the class this book gets me going whereby we have older technologies have been reinvigorated.

246
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:55,200
We looked at in some instances almost like old wives tales, you know,

247
00:25:55,720 --> 00:26:02,590
translated the old wives tales where people said, Oh, well, it basically means we're not too sure of the history.

248
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:08,410
There's a mix behind it. Often times that's too casual observation.

249
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:13,420
And those observations, while descriptive and nicely say quantitative, actually helps in truth.

250
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:17,770
So we'll be talking to these older technologies that are not coming back again.

251
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:23,530
For example, Silver, Copper, this recall.

252
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:30,300
So we had a huge piece on copper and we had to sell the study suite, right?

253
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:37,000
So that will be talking about how people intention use of copper can actually prevent infection in the hospital.

254
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:48,190
That silver not only good for killing vampires but generally but also has very strong anti-microbial properties and is being used in blocking things.

255
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:53,620
And I'll give a hint of that actually fairly soon. Okay.

256
00:26:53,710 --> 00:27:00,310
So the course summary, basically a highlighting here, the three main points we're going to minimize, introduce and discuss.

257
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:08,350
Okay. So criminalize you all with the first line methods to control populations of microbes and first line method.

258
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:12,570
Okay. What do I mean by that?

259
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:17,230
Read the next sentence. These methods will be in contrast to the use of antibiotics.

260
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:21,790
If you would like me to, I can study do a lot more than antibiotics, but.

261
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:27,020
I know other classes do that. I know that in my classes.

262
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:31,190
That's true. All they talk about when he talks, they think about mechanisms of resistance.

263
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:40,730
Few classes actually have other things like biocides by a side by side.

264
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:49,220
Ethanol will be reliant on this for the last couple of years. Right. Concerning ammonium compounds, this one here, ash,

265
00:27:50,020 --> 00:28:01,370
but you usually see roughly 40 C 12 C40 C 16 optional decal dimethyl ammonium provides a whole load of them here c 14 c 12,

266
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:07,669
c 16 could be a positive one. All these funky things can be active ingredients.

267
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:11,120
They're really focusing a lot more on that.

268
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:22,879
Okay. Why is the first line in my my I don't mind sharing this with you, my father, even though this is a confusing EU,

269
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:28,850
even though I'm from England, my parents live in France, they retired there.

270
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:32,239
My dad had to have a knee replacement. If you in America,

271
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:37,399
the kind of country full of antibiotics taken all these antiques beforehand and then said go on in and have the operation

272
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:43,430
in Haiti and the ongoing fights with we don't want to use antibiotics good antibiotic stewardship in action here.

273
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:47,000
Antibiotic stewardship sent me maybe some you know about that.

274
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:48,590
We'll get to that as well.

275
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:56,900
Instead, we're going to tax it like in iodine, make sure we use plutonium, scrubs, the surgeons and we're just going to do it and see what happens.

276
00:28:56,900 --> 00:29:06,200
And he didn't need any antibiotics, so we had a whole knee replaced and he was good to go just because of the good practice first line techniques.

277
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:16,940
And so that's what I want to talk about. The I know it has me, but talk about the first line of control of microorganisms.

278
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:22,249
Okay. I'm sorry. I smile and I laugh.

279
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:25,790
I jump on it. This really gets to my favorite. So be warned.

280
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:32,839
Get my gets my intellectual juices going next to introduce the concept to multi-species

281
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:38,210
bathroom communities and that now I'm moving away from word with resistance recalcitrance.

282
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:44,700
And if that were be better I'll get that later that the same way right now okay I

283
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:50,630
you to enhance selection of anti-microbial resistance so we'll get to that as well.

284
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:58,610
Also, we're going to discuss strategies that's could be adopted to enhance microbial control strategies in domestic public and medical settings.

285
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:04,399
So this is going to be both a technological level, okay, at the intellectual level.

286
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:14,720
So thinking about what we do in the academy, academic studies also then putting into practice both through administration,

287
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:17,810
state level, federal level at a worldwide level as well.

288
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:29,900
Okay. Now, competency is this is part of the whole AP program here, if you want to to say what would be time kind of covering hands to do is safe.

289
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:37,310
These are many things that will be so relating to here. We sort of like these key aspects, if you will.

290
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:43,840
But the most important thing really is the course goals which work today greatest.

291
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:48,770
Why propose? I think this is kind of a best way to do it.

292
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:53,360
I want to do class discussions as well. I'd like to have people in for this.

293
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:59,720
If you can't make it and I'm a nice guy, I certainly know in advance you sit in on events, I'm going to do Panopto.

294
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:05,810
I'm not sure that was meant released every single time if I'm going to release it to people that only helped.

295
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:09,979
What have other people been doing? The classes last year? I should put disclosure.

296
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:16,070
Last semester I was doing a lab class, so Panopto was not exactly a thing.

297
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:21,290
You could do it in my lab. Okay. So what is the current strategy to anyone?

298
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:26,420
No, I think there usually is really some terrible I mean, I'm happy to do that.

299
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:34,550
But I would I, I would do that. The understanding that people are going to be here because it think that actually is anyway 10% of it.

300
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:38,899
This class is based on class discussions and or projects you go home to.

301
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:42,320
They're writing a bit of research going and we discuss it as a class. Okay.

302
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:49,850
So heads up, for example, one thing that we will be doing is are we giving the task to go home next week?

303
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:57,110
This is kind of fun. I'm going to give folks months which do that. And it's your job to find an anti-microbial product in your home.

304
00:31:57,110 --> 00:32:00,809
But the active ingredient is and what's a little bit about it I'm talking right,

305
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:05,299
is if you actually was not living big, just just to make your eyes open, go, whoa.

306
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:11,150
What is all this stuff in my house? Okay, it'll blow your mind.

307
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:16,010
I will also bring something in, so I'm gonna bring something in.

308
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:21,349
But, you know, you can do that. What? You just write about and talk about the ideas.

309
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:26,090
What is talk about that that you sometimes I try to, you know, try and create discussion, get to know each other,

310
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:34,610
talk about what we have, talk about, you know, topics we're going to cover, quizzes, whatever that.

311
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:40,219
So 2 to 4 short form quizzes needs to be consisting of multiple choice.

312
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:45,950
True folks have short answers. So when this happened now cracks that to an extent is this to that you're going to want

313
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:51,710
anyway and the idea is those quizzes can be take home quizzes or it could be in-person here.

314
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:58,040
Okay, so take home quiz could be a paper I gave you and then I'll post and questions and you write it up,

315
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:01,880
read the paper and we said or I'll give you a paper who come in to do it.

316
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:06,680
And digital quiz here. Most of my quizzes are 30 people to be in my class.

317
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:14,900
No, this Morgan you've seen before, for example, that she made is short for multiple choice, you know, true folks, that kind of stuff.

318
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:18,890
Okay. I don't mind doing essay questions for quizzes or anything like that.

319
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:22,180
Okay. Everyone's given speeds. Types of different speeds, I think is back.

320
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:26,780
Give me one midterm exam that we're recovering the course content.

321
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:33,890
Okay. And that will be on based on the slides, the papers associated with that, I'm not going to do loads of papers.

322
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:42,860
I'm not going to give you actually loads. Amanda The class does that one to a certain level, but this one, we have a lot more discussion and thought.

323
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:44,810
Does that make sense? Okay.

324
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:53,330
And then the homework would be two essays, a shorter one and a larger one, and the larger one to do the final one at the end this semester.

325
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:59,930
Okay. The short one actually, I'm thinking like looking at doing one on stage technology, you know, stages.

326
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:05,790
So viruses and bacteria, something about you didn't have ever think.

327
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:08,870
Yeah, maybe a little bit. So there are viruses.

328
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:19,460
They've lost their fat gas code, which of course, for example, influenza, but also viruses that attack bacteria and some bright spark at the idea.

329
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:25,960
Hang on a second. Why do we start thinking about using viruses as a way to control microorganisms?

330
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:30,310
So bacteria call these viruses bacteriophages or phage for sure.

331
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:35,500
So if a little paper and give you a paper have some questions on that. For example, among the ideas I'm thinking about.

332
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:40,150
That makes sense. Yeah.

333
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:47,260
So that's what I'm proposing. Any thoughts? So when I look at the first two lectures, they're always warming up to know each other.

334
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:53,190
If you disagree on the discussions at all, if we're writing something, we can change a little bit.

335
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:56,710
But I want to basically keep this overall structure of the segment, if we can.

336
00:34:57,550 --> 00:35:01,560
Any thoughts? Okay.

337
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:05,850
Okay. Okay. What's happened here? And the cleanup for this time.

338
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:12,360
And I'll make sure it's licensed with my national ethics academic conduct.

339
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:19,710
Okay. In short. Just be honest. Use your own thoughts that use others don't use.

340
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:26,360
Obviously plagiarize. Cheating is not you.

341
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:31,620
He looked out. Of course. Just don't do it. Because it is an absolute nightmare of a situation.

342
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:39,090
It's not good for anyone involved. So please just make sure all your work is your own effort.

343
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:44,310
Okay. Homework. I'm kind of the last person that comes to homework.

344
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:46,290
I'm very aware that you've got lots of classes.

345
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:54,180
I also have maybe a second year, so you all kind of thinking, Oh, no, I get letters out, applications done for jobs, that kind of stuff.

346
00:35:55,770 --> 00:36:03,210
If you can't manage something or can cope it, of course, by the way, an ISP can't manage it, let me know.

347
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:11,740
I am, as I can say, approachable. I like to think that I am accepting and understanding, and I will be.

348
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:19,600
So if you email me in advance and just say, you know, I can't make it in my dream bad or can I have an extra day for this?

349
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:23,740
This is the reason why I'm okay with that. Okay.

350
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:30,040
The only time that I would struggle with not being okay with that is the last essay.

351
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:34,300
And there's a reason behind that is because time is always a question near the end.

352
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:38,520
I have the other grading in. I don't if you notice. Nope. The only way I can enter the grade.

353
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:46,690
So if I have everyone's working. If one person is missing, I can't enter everyone's unless I give that person an ally.

354
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:48,970
Does that make sense? So my system works.

355
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:54,700
So the only time where we send it you really get something on time is the last essay more than anything else.

356
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:59,050
Everything else. If it's, you know, if you really are in trouble, let me know.

357
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:05,430
Ideally, stick to the schedule. Okay. I just know life can be pretty hectic these days.

358
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:10,590
They will miss me because of that. Okay. Aside readings.

359
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:15,000
Now, as I said, this is this the stuff from coming out this book?

360
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:18,870
Okay. I'll blow my own trumpet for a second.

361
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:25,860
I read a chapter in this book. So, again, nice image of the kind of talking about because the course is named after the book.

362
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:30,270
So feel free to have a look through it if you want to pass it around.

363
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:37,800
It's pretty dense. The stuff in here that I'm not covered during the course, you don't need it.

364
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:44,340
In fact, I would urge you not to buy it because I think the newer versions came out, but it's like $100.

365
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:56,100
So what I would suggest you do is just rely on me to give you the papers and to scan it, scan sections as needed, all that kind of stuff.

366
00:37:56,460 --> 00:38:00,630
Does that make sense? So that's my thoughts.

367
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:12,630
Any questions about that? The good thing about it is I always can then go through and give you websites as well and news articles and videos.

368
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:24,120
And I want to make sure clear one thing here, and that is that this isn't a field that is in the last decade, two decades, not even centuries.

369
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:31,960
We're talking about thousands of years. I want to have papers and I want to have discussions that reflect the history here.

370
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:40,320
I mean, have an understanding of the history. If you don't have an understanding of the history, we will make the same mistakes over and over again.

371
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:47,940
And also think about go back to the material advice of mine and write a little voice.

372
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:55,170
Let's go to mythologies. Alex's voice. I collect old books, old microbiology books from eBay.

373
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:59,280
I also collect Mouthwashes to actually get in country, but I don't go to that one.

374
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:03,030
But that's my two big vices. But that's what I use about the books.

375
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:08,099
Why do why does this guy collect books from like a book from 1890?

376
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:16,350
It's Cambridge University Press from the first scientific books talking about the antiquity of man and refers to microbes as being plants.

377
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:24,180
Can't close your mind. Why? Why is each of these books is because people have some really interesting ideas.

378
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:31,050
Even the Greek philosophers had fantastic ideas and persuaded everyone in a while then and allowed them to do things.

379
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:35,250
And some of that information has been forgotten. Why has it been forgotten?

380
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:45,150
Because other technologies are being touted to be better. And in those days, people couldn't get an appreciation for what was going on.

381
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:55,260
They didn't stand about microorganisms and they certainly didn't understand, you know, all sorts of other things that were happening.

382
00:39:55,470 --> 00:40:00,270
And they couldn't do the experiments to really develop that understanding.

383
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:05,600
So makes sense. So I go to his old books.

384
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:09,480
I look at this stuff like, for example, as a guide for Joseph Bigger.

385
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:12,750
Joseph Bigger introduced the word sisters.

386
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:16,480
I never heard of the sisters. Yes, little bit.

387
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:25,210
So persist is a micro always means that no matter what you think of them in a therapeutic level anyway, they will survive.

388
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:29,740
They persist like the Borg, like yourself.

389
00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:34,930
Now I'm also Trekkie fan. Star Trek the Borg machines that half human half machines have to survive.

390
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:39,520
There's microbes in that obviously not machine that they can just survive.

391
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:45,640
And we'll talk about that as well. He noticed that no one believed him for decades.

392
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:49,900
And now he's going back and going, hang on, this is actually real.

393
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:54,670
What's going on here? And we're talking about sisters in the class. So that might interest you all as well.

394
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:59,800
Okay. And that's the reason why there may be sisters, why you take a long course of antibiotics.

395
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:06,290
If they do all right now, it's going to go against me.

396
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:09,560
Sure. Absolutely. I'm really, really.

397
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:17,970
Pro diversity, equity inclusion. I think that works on so many levels that we need to really encourage this.

398
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:26,460
And in that sort of vein, I want to make sure that we all understand that we acknowledge that diverse experiences.

399
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:33,030
I mean, personally, professionally, we all come from different backgrounds culturally.

400
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:38,370
And I think that is a strength coming of a nerd now.

401
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:41,880
But actually, I relate it to microbiology. I related to dental plaque.

402
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:47,940
Did you know there were 500 different species of bacteria all living together in your mouth in dental black?

403
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:52,620
Okay. Working together. Some not really working, but certainly interacting.

404
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:57,630
Okay. I mean, maybe just divide that two into 2 to 2 evolve.

405
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:05,130
And I think about that in our classroom in a similar way. What different backgrounds, different experiences, different knowledges.

406
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:12,540
And we all have something unique to bring. Also a bit like King Arthur and his roundtable again.

407
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:19,049
Okay. And I want to make sure that we equally recognize that and we appreciate each other.

408
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:24,900
And we are congenial and we are understanding. And the way I like to simply put it is no one is wrong.

409
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:30,380
Everyone has an idea and we should all think about it and accepting positive way.

410
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:37,750
Okay. I say to create an environment, see if you have an issue and try to do it.

411
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:44,770
Mix it with directive, encourage an equitable classroom participation and ensure students in fact abide by UN policies and procedures.

412
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:49,240
Of course, and the university is really pushing this I think is great. Any questions on that?

413
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:55,560
Okay. Classroom expectations and etiquette.

414
00:42:56,610 --> 00:43:01,500
Basically what we're having is sort of like lectures and presentations from me,

415
00:43:02,430 --> 00:43:10,940
as well as formal discussions based on a topic area under consideration and and fluid like discussions as well.

416
00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:17,070
So feel free to raise your hand or if I stop and you say, actually, Ricardo, Alex, it might go either way.

417
00:43:18,210 --> 00:43:22,340
But I thought just throughout for kind of don't be afraid, okay?

418
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:29,520
There's no thing isn't daft. Daft questions and there's no daft answers is a learning environment.

419
00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:38,040
And what I say is that we are all learners in here so much greater than others.

420
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:42,540
Okay, but we are all that is always learning new things.

421
00:43:43,170 --> 00:43:47,310
And you might say something like, Hmm, I wouldn't know the answer to it.

422
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:51,430
But that doesn't mean that I won't have to try to figure it out for you.

423
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:55,840
Or maybe some in the class will tell you that I'm trying to figure it out. That's the whole point of this class.

424
00:43:56,050 --> 00:44:01,210
Okay. Explore avenues to do this in a collegial academic environment.

425
00:44:02,370 --> 00:44:05,530
Some good. Great. Okay.

426
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:11,500
So building on that classroom performance expectations.

427
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:16,930
One thing I was toying with was part of the last project was do a little presentation.

428
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:22,570
I'm still thinking maybe about that as an idea.

429
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:27,010
I will talk about that in the next class, but I'm moving away from the idea.

430
00:44:27,010 --> 00:44:30,910
In previous years I've done it, but it was kind of silly. We were stressed about presenting.

431
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:38,770
If you do it maybe a more like five minute thing to make sense of what you're doing or maybe the ten minute macro thing.

432
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:44,140
I'll let you know on that one. What are your thoughts? Do you have any concerns about presenting?

433
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:48,050
So the last rites can be, like you said something.

434
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:56,510
So what gave me the idea was this year in the lab class and last year they did a final report as well based on the lab

435
00:44:56,510 --> 00:45:03,740
work and what actually helped them with giving a small presentation of what they're looking at and doing with this.

436
00:45:04,070 --> 00:45:08,630
And then your feedback for me and from the class actually immensely helped.

437
00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:13,400
What are your thoughts on that game? So I'm just talking about how the syllabus is a little organic and beginning.

438
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:21,970
Do you like that idea? A possibility? I have to think about it, but that's what I'm thinking of.

439
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:24,379
We can tie in here if you want to do that.

440
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:34,700
But right now I spoke to what's the overall expectation to class up lecture slides, lectures on in person and may be recorded by side it.

441
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:44,000
You want it recorded fine would you recorded so you're going to be but watching that but so it will be recorded bus attendance

442
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:49,969
is need is kind of great in an excellent classroom discussion so you sort of 10% that relates to classroom discussions.

443
00:45:49,970 --> 00:45:55,460
If you don't turn up obviously you can't then for example be part of the discussion, especially when certain things are given out.

444
00:45:55,610 --> 00:46:02,450
For example, when you go home next week and find that new anti-microbial thing that you never realized was an anti-microbial in the house.

445
00:46:02,450 --> 00:46:10,490
And by the way, it will shock you just again, even simple things like makeup and anti-microbial was in it.

446
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:19,610
And then you're Googling out what is this associated with just considered a pesticide, to example, blow your mind to things.

447
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:23,030
Same goes for mouthwash and toothpaste, not Crest.

448
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:28,520
And Colgate and Listerine have different ingredients, different claims.

449
00:46:28,790 --> 00:46:33,359
It's kind of. Research papers.

450
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:37,230
I'll be providing research papers and review papers for you to build off that book.

451
00:46:37,470 --> 00:46:40,470
Okay. It's not.

452
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:43,459
Now, here's a here's a quick question for you,

453
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:48,990
or I want to make sure that we are feeling comfortable in this class to see anything makes you feel comfortable.

454
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:52,800
How many of you had formal microbiology classes in the past?

455
00:46:54,930 --> 00:46:58,380
Yeah. Not all of you, right? Maybe. Biology. Biology?

456
00:46:58,710 --> 00:47:06,000
Yeah. Okay. Now again. So my point is, I'm not going to throw like this high end stuff out of you, okay?

457
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:10,890
If you start struggling, let me know. I already told you I plant books.

458
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:18,030
You sure you see my office? Because you go my index like a book bomb is going off.

459
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:25,200
Like this is books everywhere. So the point is, I can only see this week the weakest paragraph.

460
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:28,740
A read this page or these couple of pages help you get up to speed.

461
00:47:28,830 --> 00:47:32,190
Something of value that makes sense. So if you're struggling, just let me know.

462
00:47:32,610 --> 00:47:41,340
Actually, I would be way more happy if you say I actually reach out to, you know, coming, meet me in the cafeteria,

463
00:47:42,450 --> 00:47:49,260
have a cup of tea if they open that place up sooner rather than later and discuss where you write about what kind of things you don't understand.

464
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:53,040
Okay. But I'm not going to go heavy into one particular topic.

465
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:57,370
I'm going to make sure you get me going to things and stop me in the class, if you like.

466
00:47:57,390 --> 00:48:02,690
I don't understand. Okay. Can I bet you if you said it knows me to say I'm within the standards.

467
00:48:03,150 --> 00:48:09,479
You're not alone at all. Okay, so, everyone, I'm guilty of it.

468
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:12,360
We all like to try and make it seem as though that we are.

469
00:48:13,470 --> 00:48:19,500
We know more than we do sometimes, or as you know we do, but always afraid of looking dark, so drunk and it daft.

470
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:24,360
You won't act out if you have any questions in this class. Okay. Guarantee it.

471
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:28,020
And I will be absolutely happy to help everyone.

472
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:31,680
Okay. Any questions so far?

473
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:36,370
Okay. Um. I put canvas.

474
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:39,490
Zoom meetings. I did this last semester.

475
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:43,900
I'm m i because of covid. I'm now trying to meld Cuban ideas.

476
00:48:44,730 --> 00:48:46,960
Met the class. Now we're back in the classroom.

477
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:53,720
So for that one thing that we did during COVID, which I didn't like, was we did basically all lectures on Zoom, right?

478
00:48:54,810 --> 00:48:58,240
Um, and we relied on canvas heavily.

479
00:48:58,450 --> 00:49:03,720
I don't want to do that. I would rather be more personable.

480
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:10,490
Give you the grades. Not do things to canvas because when a smaller group.

481
00:49:11,550 --> 00:49:17,330
Okay. So if you give Mr. Huckabee back and then you meet individually and go, oh, he did a group thing,

482
00:49:17,790 --> 00:49:21,830
okay, that all the questions which we will do and then who are you concerned individually?

483
00:49:22,590 --> 00:49:26,669
That makes sense. The quizzes, Kobach be great when you keep tally of where you go.

484
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:34,020
I'll keep an Excel sheet, for example, and if you've got any concerns, you have to come to see me is not through an automated canvas thing.

485
00:49:34,170 --> 00:49:42,420
I think that's not that's very impersonal. And I think that I like the idea that we are more in person.

486
00:49:42,790 --> 00:49:46,380
Does it make sense the bigger that you want to push?

487
00:49:46,530 --> 00:49:51,420
I do like what's happened and that is the zoom in concept, the Zoom capability.

488
00:49:51,810 --> 00:49:55,590
So for example, I'm happy to do as I call my fireside chats.

489
00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:01,800
And so before midterm, for example. Morgan Did I do that for you, for the laptops with you?

490
00:50:01,950 --> 00:50:04,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

491
00:50:05,010 --> 00:50:09,989
So basically, I will be in the basement.

492
00:50:09,990 --> 00:50:14,340
I actually will give advice to my kids. I have a seven year old and a 13 year old.

493
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:17,549
They do have attempted a zoom bomb. I think they did one time once.

494
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:21,600
Yeah. Yeah. At one time you were like physical and then you forgot about us.

495
00:50:21,690 --> 00:50:28,499
Yeah. Yeah. So I've got two young kids, and I do tend to like jumping on things and doing a little bit,

496
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:31,800
but I've actually worked around that and a little bit older since then.

497
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:39,450
I feel more understanding. So I like the idea of having a devoted time in the evenings where you can log on.

498
00:50:39,450 --> 00:50:42,509
I'll be there all quick, way hot chocolate or cup of tea dipping our legs.

499
00:50:42,510 --> 00:50:46,760
It is. And you talk and it's open to everyone.

500
00:50:47,370 --> 00:50:52,770
Like I said, I'm table all equal. Okay. And you can ask questions about the midterm, for example.

501
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:57,209
I can do for the midterm, I can do it for that because if you do a presentation,

502
00:50:57,210 --> 00:51:02,970
slash to the White House, that kind of stuff and I'm there, do some guides for the White House as well.

503
00:51:03,150 --> 00:51:06,200
So you have those in advance, way in advance. Okay.

504
00:51:07,170 --> 00:51:10,950
What are your thoughts that the idea is they must do that.

505
00:51:11,430 --> 00:51:14,790
Their classes. Okay, that's fine. I mean, I like doing it.

506
00:51:14,790 --> 00:51:18,179
So if that works for you is the opportunity. Oh, I should mention.

507
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:21,510
And if you don't want to do it, I don't mind. Okay.

508
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:25,640
I'll just simply say I think it's like eight or nine or things.

509
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:33,960
You later eight 3937 I've asked my kids now maybe speaking like I teach now, it's I'm so happy to do that as well.

510
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:38,970
It was time to go. Okay. Um, homeworks tasks.

511
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:44,860
You can do that at home. Quizzes, midterms in general, in-person.

512
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:47,930
Although there will be some quizzes and motivation one night advanced.

513
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:53,270
That sounds terrible. What do you wish? It's already good to go ask me to take him question.

514
00:51:54,260 --> 00:52:00,290
Makes sense that she's a, quote unquote rational drug discussion at one time anyway.

515
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:07,460
Good discussions always. So please feel free to just jump in at any time.

516
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:12,470
Okay. One reason why I'm saying about the whole.

517
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:16,790
Don't feel like you're doesn't intimidate. That's what I'm really to intimidated.

518
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:21,140
Who jumps around from many different fields.

519
00:52:22,910 --> 00:52:30,530
I have a unique perspective intimidation about how you feel like, oh, I don't know much, you know, academic, academic, intellectual standpoint.

520
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:36,500
I don't know much about this. And I want to keep quiet, but we actually doing this every day service.

521
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:43,970
My female boss is Pauline Henry. She actually she was amazing.

522
00:52:45,890 --> 00:52:49,820
She always said, don't get intimidated.

523
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:53,780
Don't feel like I always ask questions. Don't don't shy away.

524
00:52:54,750 --> 00:53:04,550
Okay? Like if you don't to the stand or if you disagree, respectfully say with each other with me and ask, ask away.

525
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:14,980
I really like the CORNISH person to me is saying I love banter is bad to translate banter discussion like in a pub or you know,

526
00:53:15,550 --> 00:53:16,910
in a restaurant and talking around.

527
00:53:17,090 --> 00:53:25,650
That's why we want to encourage our Internet research is going to be a very big thing near the end and Google PubMed Parson's office offices.

528
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:28,940
So you look at the European EPO, you've been patent office.

529
00:53:29,270 --> 00:53:34,070
The U.S. Patent Office is thinking about that, new technologies, government resources.

530
00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:38,899
And here's a really fun bit now that I'm trying to organize at this, but I'm not going to promise yet.

531
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:43,880
I was actually over dental school this morning pre-COVID.

532
00:53:44,390 --> 00:53:47,600
I managed to wrangle a field trip.

533
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:58,300
So it's a coup. So basically we'll we talking about sterilizing life example or autoclaves behavior is seen an outlier here.

534
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:05,440
Okay. How many have you seen autoclaves that are like half the size of this will roll on roll off ones and the whole.

535
00:54:06,230 --> 00:54:13,959
Oh, fine. But it's two of you. But the point is, in a real working environment, I think maybe the hospital you might have thought.

536
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:19,590
Yeah, we went to the hospital. Why it's so important to have it.

537
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:25,420
Yeah. So they managed I think last year, maybe even not allowed me because the hospital is tightening rules.

538
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:29,860
I'm trying to work with the dental school to see if we can do this again.

539
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:36,040
So I popped in to the dean's office today for academic affairs,

540
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:42,720
had a chat with some of the administrators and tell them what we used to do and the permits.

541
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:46,520
So here's the thing that actually happened was I went to dental school.

542
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:53,230
If you guys notice what's happened in the last year, structurally speaking, make it by me building.

543
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:56,530
I walk to go. I know where the sterilization facilities are.

544
00:54:56,740 --> 00:55:02,030
I walk there. They're gone. I don't know where they are, so I don't even know where they are.

545
00:55:02,050 --> 00:55:08,300
The person's going to be changed, so I'll keep watching this space.

546
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:09,459
I'd like us to do a field trip.

547
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:17,560
If we can't do a field trip, then we might do a show and tell you might just do a tour of the labs and talking, show some technologies off.

548
00:55:17,950 --> 00:55:23,780
I don't do something out of the classroom if we can, or if it's in the classroom, maybe some kind of light reading and discussion.

549
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:29,260
I don't know what yet, but the ultimate would be to do a theoretical over again the enemy concerns about that.

550
00:55:30,370 --> 00:55:36,160
We'd be kind of funded if we can try and do it. Okay. So again, I'm not promising, but I would not do that.

551
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:42,790
The other thing is we do a lab exercise, I should mention as well. I do actually have just kind of cool as well.

552
00:55:42,790 --> 00:55:48,010
We've got new we have a new fifth floor lab, virtually speaking.

553
00:55:48,670 --> 00:55:56,530
I mean, might we do something in there? It would be small maybe to showing off, you know, what is acting like,

554
00:55:56,710 --> 00:56:01,720
showing a big demonstration of how we test vaccine like resistance or showing some to something like that.

555
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:06,250
But I'd rather do something either over the dental school.

556
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:10,540
I think that would rather do much more than anything. I think that'll be a lot of fun.

557
00:56:11,620 --> 00:56:14,670
Okay. Depending on the class size as well.

558
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:19,840
That's the other issue they asked me today and I said that about 15 students who point great into two groups and do that for ten,

559
00:56:19,850 --> 00:56:24,210
15 minutes each, that's what I'm thinking. That's what we did in the past.

560
00:56:24,270 --> 00:56:28,540
Will give us that so we can do last bit.

561
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:36,100
So this is meant to be organic for us to our classes. What are your interests and what are your thoughts?

562
00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:41,050
Okay. And what do you want to be in the future when you see where this class is going?

563
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:51,940
Based upon New York. So this is zip out now and go to Candice Rapid on here's a summary of everything and I tend to lecture plan.

564
00:56:52,450 --> 00:56:59,140
Okay. Again, not by accident. Subject to modification, we take into consideration class progress, interests and discussion.

565
00:56:59,590 --> 00:57:03,550
Is everyone happy with me? Doing that I think is way better because.

566
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:13,830
Okay, for example. What is the article about a new news bad news article that came out fairly recently?

567
00:57:16,190 --> 00:57:19,700
Talking about new, actually my favorite. It doesn't really matter.

568
00:57:19,910 --> 00:57:24,280
But basically the point is to be new stories that are emerging during the semester break.

569
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:30,440
It's really interesting. So, for example, last year there was some talk about the Neisseria gonorrhea,

570
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:37,670
sexually transmitted disease bacteria actually becoming resistance to last line of resistance, the last line of drugs.

571
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:41,870
Okay. So a little discussion about that, for example. It makes sense.

572
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:47,030
So we can certainly bring things in. So topic areas.

573
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:52,670
I thought course introduction plans this semester. So this discussion about one lecture here, we can go to one or two.

574
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:58,820
History, the history of microbial control and this sort of flexibility.

575
00:57:59,310 --> 00:58:06,170
Then I want to cover physical control, filter control filters, autoclaves, EUV, and these are all merged a little bit.

576
00:58:06,170 --> 00:58:12,920
And I really started to more structure and we start talking about things that I biocides versus antibiotics actually and that we met quite at point.

577
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:20,990
I decided that I'm testing mechanisms, controversy and a focus on cationic anti-microbial, cationic anti-microbial.

578
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:24,889
So I think they're going to catch on a cancer microbial life.

579
00:58:24,890 --> 00:58:29,060
So we pass it around and things like that.

580
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:36,650
Okay. Then I want to cover essential oils, even a product that is famous for essential oils.

581
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:43,000
And it. I'm pretty sure many of you used it.

582
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:55,009
Listerine mouthwash contains multiple essential oils and has been around since the 1800s and multiple claims over the

583
00:58:55,010 --> 00:59:02,330
years and variety of things ranging from treating wounds to obviously soldiers and so forth and in the field during war,

584
00:59:02,870 --> 00:59:06,500
but also to more recently mouthwash.

585
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:14,480
Okay, so how about that again? How essential is it made and how or how to exert anti-microbial effect?

586
00:59:14,870 --> 00:59:20,000
Let me talk about the sisters and persistence. I really want it to be about enzymes.

587
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:23,540
There's a company called No Designs to Dutch Company.

588
00:59:24,530 --> 00:59:30,440
They are really pushing the boundaries of new ways to control microcosms and prevent infections

589
00:59:30,710 --> 00:59:36,740
and also use microorganisms for other processes such as detergents and detergent production,

590
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:41,330
enzyme production and waste, all sorts in probiotics.

591
00:59:41,510 --> 00:59:47,180
So if that's of interest to you, although it's two steps and I'm really strongly into probiotics.

592
00:59:47,490 --> 00:59:55,850
Then to get industrial food production. Talk about the concerns, but also how we prepare food.

593
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:58,280
So you're probably thinking why not in the kitchen?

594
00:59:58,790 --> 01:00:09,380
Actually, I'm also thinking about what happened at the farmyard all the way through to the kitchen, the burger box on your plate, whatever it may be.

595
01:00:09,650 --> 01:00:16,070
Food, the average traveling distance for food from the farm to your plate is over 1000 miles.

596
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:22,850
What happens in the into and what how you prevent spoilage. Kind of cool, right?

597
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:29,120
So really big thoughts. Nothing at all to microbe you with what you should take on to do about that.

598
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:33,920
One of a few ideas think that new technologies that are coming out.

599
01:00:33,950 --> 01:00:40,910
I actually really like the idea of dispersing disperse and be that type of it in the thanks to me as well.

600
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:47,350
But I also like the idea of fatty acids and that's causing bacteria to come away from biofilms.

601
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:52,520
So some of that maybe I'm thinking about, I would of surprise you on that one.

602
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:57,800
I want to do a video lecture at some stage, so put that in there.

603
01:00:58,370 --> 01:01:05,500
There's some really cool videos out there. It's more of a relaxing one where we're getting really fast.

604
01:01:05,780 --> 01:01:14,540
Lots of different topics. Good for me to sit back and have a talk about and just talk about bathroom control with some videos integrated into that.

605
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:18,530
One thing I noticed I didn't really do, I got nowhere in here.

606
01:01:18,530 --> 01:01:22,600
I actually explicitly lecture on biofilms, so I think I might do that.

607
01:01:22,650 --> 01:01:26,600
That might be useful. Yeah.

608
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:31,100
So basically what are you saying that, you know, microbiology, you know,

609
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:36,980
some you have some experience or some experience in biology, chemistry, context.

610
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:39,290
I know some of you come from biochemistry,

611
01:01:39,620 --> 01:01:48,770
so different perspectives I'm thinking of might inserting Electrum because it will overlap with a lecture that I give in 560, four, 60,

612
01:01:48,980 --> 01:01:52,430
but I think that should be the right thing to do based on what we have discussions so far,

613
01:01:52,430 --> 01:01:57,170
because that's how you can do electron biofilms an entire together why they are resistant.

614
01:01:58,230 --> 01:02:03,150
Sandra okay. I think a knowledge of what a biker actually is going to be useful.

615
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:09,540
Okay. So now I'll put in industrial food production is okay with that.

616
01:02:10,850 --> 01:02:15,569
And those are the midterm with you, something to review in class.

617
01:02:15,570 --> 01:02:24,540
And then I think yes, then I thought on the Monday before, so you can give you the class, you know,

618
01:02:25,110 --> 01:02:32,040
then in the first you sing about that and then on the the day before the actual midterm,

619
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:37,499
I will go online and you can ask your last questions and a sense to have me ask you ask

620
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:43,760
questions and ask the questions your staff code and not to show what are we talking about.

621
01:02:43,770 --> 01:02:47,070
It makes sense if it we're going to be telling you why now.

622
01:02:48,450 --> 01:02:55,050
And I got a tentative school sterilizations, sterilization facilities, field trip or lab visit or something like that here.

623
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:58,739
So that's one thing I want to bring in. Actually, we haven't done that.

624
01:02:58,740 --> 01:03:03,600
So last year is the first year the course came back and we couldn't do it last year because we had COVID restrictions.

625
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:07,170
Now this year tends to be too much feelers out to see what we can do.

626
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:11,010
Okay. So I will keep you updated on that one.

627
01:03:11,550 --> 01:03:14,670
Um, they have the midterm results in discussion.

628
01:03:14,670 --> 01:03:16,920
I'd like to be completely transparent about this so stuff.

629
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:26,459
So basically I'll go with the midterm and then you can challenge me if you think I got questions wrong grading or if

630
01:03:26,460 --> 01:03:34,530
you think that there should be some change in second way and all is okay that I really want to get into the idea.

631
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:40,740
So I should say here, I'll put these two together as a typo. Basically.

632
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:50,070
Want to good introduction to copper. Okay. This midterm we've done up here copper and I'm going to focus on hot required infections in copper.

633
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:53,880
And actually this Celio study, which is really, really blow your mind.

634
01:03:54,420 --> 01:03:58,749
In short, they pulled out of lots of things.

635
01:03:58,750 --> 01:04:03,360
Some hospitals like door handles and replaced them to plastic or metal aluminum.

636
01:04:04,230 --> 01:04:12,120
So guess what it is? They're obviously aluminum again, except the limited aluminum handles versus copper handles.

637
01:04:12,210 --> 01:04:20,490
What happened there? Pretty cool story then I think you're bringing the mar upon study,

638
01:04:20,490 --> 01:04:26,010
which is the multiple antibiotic resistance option and actually having a complaint about how

639
01:04:26,010 --> 01:04:32,650
we think about resistance and tolerance and how it can be swayed by lab studies choices.

640
01:04:32,670 --> 01:04:38,729
We are worlds. That's okay. This one will blow your mind as well.

641
01:04:38,730 --> 01:04:46,049
Decontamination and dentistry. So one thing I'm thinking about is we can always move this down a bit further.

642
01:04:46,050 --> 01:04:51,420
If you wanted to after the visit to dental school, if we wanted something can give you a break after that.

643
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:58,739
So speaking on events so you don't mix two ideas together and then future technologies

644
01:04:58,740 --> 01:05:02,400
and impending issues I think might be a really cool thing to cover as well.

645
01:05:03,810 --> 01:05:07,200
And this is the new stuff, new stuff that's coming out.

646
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:16,260
So different materials that are being used, nanotechnology that'll be really cool and to cover as well.

647
01:05:18,060 --> 01:05:24,090
And you heard of anything you think is going to introduce new technologies, old technologies.

648
01:05:24,810 --> 01:05:29,040
What do you think this is proposed syllabus. Yeah.

649
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:36,270
I will tell you right now that this this syllabus is based upon much of what we use of this class.

650
01:05:36,630 --> 01:05:42,750
But me teaching other classes as well that no longer exist. So I used to teach microbial communities in health and disease and lecture class.

651
01:05:43,020 --> 01:05:44,820
I'm bringing elements of that in as well.

652
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:54,020
So I've got a pile of like tens of slide decks, tens of PowerPoint files, loads of them, which I'm choosing from.

653
01:05:54,030 --> 01:05:58,890
So this is just what I picked out thinking this become. This is me thinking any kind of group.

654
01:05:59,550 --> 01:06:03,070
I know we all can. Different backgrounds with a nice round table. If you've got other ideas.

655
01:06:03,330 --> 01:06:07,620
Send me an email. Shout out. Think about it. Mention it next time.

656
01:06:08,250 --> 01:06:12,570
Okay. I'm all ears. Okay.

657
01:06:13,110 --> 01:06:17,560
This is a 500 level class is meant to be no longer like most friends.

658
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:24,710
Undergraduate. My grandfather used to say, you learn the glossary and glossary little bit, but they're also going to go way beyond that.

659
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:30,120
Start talking about cool things, be more like philosophers, and thinking about the implications of things as well.

660
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:39,760
Sam Cooke. Okay. Okay.

661
01:06:39,940 --> 01:06:45,280
So, um, COVID 19 statement, obviously things have calmed down.

662
01:06:45,820 --> 01:06:49,990
Touchwood Things are gonna get better and better if you're sick.

663
01:06:50,110 --> 01:06:56,020
In short, Duncan and I will be absolutely fine with that.

664
01:06:58,870 --> 01:07:09,670
I don't want to see other people don't see myself getting sick. It's simply just take care of yourselves and also take care of others by your actions.

665
01:07:09,730 --> 01:07:14,650
So basically there's loads of rules and available information available.

666
01:07:14,650 --> 01:07:21,820
So at the UN Web site, basically we should adhere to what UN is saying all of us to do.

667
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:29,880
And I also think we should basically just be kind and considerate to each other.

668
01:07:31,390 --> 01:07:39,670
Accents. As you figured out by now, I'm kind of a very relaxed kind of person, so let me know in advance.

669
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:43,150

676
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:21,730
about 40 seconds now to say who they are,

677
01:08:21,730 --> 01:08:28,840
what the academic background is, what their intended career trajectory is, known and appropriate, and a fun fact about yourselves.

678
01:08:29,630 --> 01:08:40,050
There's no because I am I'm a second year now we are so not quite this but it's

679
01:08:40,630 --> 01:08:45,760
particularly with relating to like the next stuff we're kind of cert disciplines.

680
01:08:48,220 --> 01:08:57,730
Yeah. I suppose in the coming months I'll be looking for either consulting or more government agency kind of jobs.

681
01:08:57,730 --> 01:09:02,950
There we ten. Yes. Oh, good.

682

Jordan, I'm a second year hospital like an epidemiologist.

683
01:09:07,690 --> 01:09:14,079
Different backgrounds like microbiology, biochemistry and then a considered introductory.

684
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:20,220
I'm trying to get a fellowship right now at the CDC or the FDA or one of those companies right now.

Hello, everyone. I'm Morgan. I'm also a second year agency reporter.

692
01:10:02,780 --> 01:10:05,980
And sure, my background is public health.

693
01:10:06,070 --> 01:10:11,350
Also with microalgae biology, you kind of mix in there for different backgrounds.

694
01:10:12,130 --> 01:10:18,010
My career trajectory, I'm really torn between like infection prevention or working for a health department

695
01:10:18,010 --> 01:10:22,659
doing epidemiology research on like antimicrobial resistance or like microbiology.

696
01:10:22,660 --> 01:10:26,620
Kind of the background for someone that like I was easy as a bunch of stuff I've seen

697
01:10:26,980 --> 01:10:33,790
out there that a fun fact about me I used to dependably figure state I don't anymore,

698
01:10:33,790 --> 01:10:38,380
but now I just go to that for a while. Wow.

699
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:42,940
Huh. So, yeah, it's all about back to you. My kids are learning to skate.

700
01:10:42,940 --> 01:10:50,629
Yes, that's right. Yeah. So obviously me pictures, my daughter, he was fearless and my son used older and much more cautious.

701
01:10:50,630 --> 01:10:54,480
2020, they're both trying to skate first. I'd say, Oh, that's so much fun.

702
01:10:54,730 --> 01:11:04,700
And somebody makes it fun fact. For a second year and germane student academic background.

703
01:11:05,270 --> 01:11:11,930
I went to undergrad at UC Irvine and did a little like literature review for my PI over there about diet.

704
01:11:11,940 --> 01:11:20,450
And now I do mostly like viruses with Dr. Gordon right across them, literally right across the hall from Dr. Ricard on the fifth floor.

705
01:11:21,350 --> 01:11:30,590
Something interesting about me, since we're like in the realm of like sports and activities, I do more tai and Brazilian jiu jitsu on the side.

706
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:35,180
I'm not really great. Still hold still.

707
01:11:36,620 --> 01:11:42,280
I haven't done it in the month of December because it was breaking, so I needed a break.

708
01:11:42,290 --> 01:11:46,460
This is my first year of flashback and I'm not looking forward to.

709
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:50,840
Yeah. My name is James. Cool.

710
01:11:51,170 --> 01:12:01,670
I'm a first year blockbuster, and, um, I did my undergrad in biology, and I like to collect postcards, fixing to collect what's left of postcards.

711
01:12:01,910 --> 01:12:05,500
Postcards? Oh, that's cool. That is really cool.

712
01:12:06,230 --> 01:12:09,800
Well, welcome my name.

713
01:12:09,890 --> 01:12:15,320
So I'm an undergrad senior year track background.

714
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:17,030
I'm currently EMT right now.

715
01:12:17,030 --> 01:12:27,440
I'm running club kidney disease screening, where it's program and then career trajectory, hoping to go to med school and then.

716
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:31,340
Fun fact about myself. My eye color has changed twice.

717
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:35,660
I was born with blue eyes and then changed to green another hazel.

718
01:12:35,780 --> 01:12:40,520
So it's kind of. Wow. Yeah, that's cool.

719
01:12:41,930 --> 01:12:45,200
Welcome back. Thank you. Hi, guys. My name is Hilary.

720
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:48,620
I'm a senior in the undergraduate program of School Public Health.

721
01:12:49,610 --> 01:12:54,320
I'm also planning to go to medical school. And I guess a fun fact is that however, the devil is here.

722
01:12:55,160 --> 01:12:58,550
That's cool. How people can genuinely.

723
01:13:00,290 --> 01:13:04,290
I wish. I wish I could. Wow.

724
01:13:04,370 --> 01:13:07,969
Yeah. That's very impressive. Welcome home. I'm Emily.

725
01:13:07,970 --> 01:13:10,490
I'm a first year master's student in the Bible studies program.

726
01:13:11,330 --> 01:13:17,570
I got my undergraduate and bachelors in math, and I minored in chemistry, and I taught accounting class semester.

727
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:24,350
So I'm like, I kind of. I like the lab side of things and I really cars.

728
01:13:25,070 --> 01:13:28,190
I love driving, I drive a manual, and I love teaching to drive.

729
01:13:29,870 --> 01:13:35,300
So my wife Joyce would describe a manual, of course, meaning that's what we have.

730
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:39,250
So it makes sense if we should drive.

731
01:13:39,260 --> 01:13:45,440
And I agree with you on that. When you take off faster, you stop.

732
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:48,830
Yes. And you more fuel economical. Yeah. So.

733
01:13:49,970 --> 01:13:53,360
Well, we say. I'm.

734
01:13:54,030 --> 01:14:02,760
I'm a second year agent student. The fun fact about me is, like, I can speak the language.

735
01:14:03,810 --> 01:14:08,820
Wow. Three languages without forgetting are just English, Japanese and Korean.

736
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:13,080
Wow. That's very impressive. So welcome.

737
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:19,770
Hi. My name is Malika and my academic background is I have a medical degree from India.

738
01:14:19,890 --> 01:14:23,480
So now I'm doing my MPH and general effort here.

739
01:14:23,490 --> 01:14:29,520
I'm in second year and I think I'm looking forward to going to clinical research or something, which is like you need to do it.

740
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:35,190
And a fun fact would be, I know what it is, but you still have a big pool.

741
01:14:35,190 --> 01:14:41,219
B B MG Yeah, yeah, yeah. So you make some minor references and then maybe above as well.

742
01:14:41,220 --> 01:14:52,290
So. Well, thank you. Everyone welcomes people to a really fun, informative, educational and fun course.

743
01:14:53,130 --> 01:14:59,340
Any concerns? Please let me know. And looking forward to getting started next week.

744
01:14:59,580 --> 01:15:04,330
And any doubts? Any questions? Real good. And I just might as well.

745
01:15:04,540 --> 01:15:10,569
I think it's really cool we did that. Shoutout, thank you for doing that and I think it makes you all aware now just how broad we all can be.

746
01:15:10,570 --> 01:15:12,280
And I actually did this on purpose,

747
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:18,970
so I get an idea how I'm going to tell you to the class to make sure I try and get to everyone's experience in that way.

748
01:15:19,300 --> 01:15:22,300
Okay. So don't worry about that. All right.

749
01:15:22,780 --> 01:15:26,830
Thank you so much and have a good weekend. We'll catch up next time.

750
01:15:28,520 --> 01:15:36,730
Oh, and next time we start the history bash. All right. Great.
