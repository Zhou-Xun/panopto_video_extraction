1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:06,810
They're just so popular that they would elicit more food.

2
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:10,800
They haven't. But there's this chocolate.

3
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:15,360
I'm going to start it over here. Take a few pieces, pass it around.

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,850
Yeah. Gonna like if you have a preference.

5
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:25,020
It's not just dark chocolate. So what do you. What's orange should I know?

6
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:29,370
It's not orange chocolate, is it. No, if you read it here.

7
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:34,590
I think I know too well the dark chocolate.

8
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:37,559
All right. So here's an overview of what we're going to discuss today.

9
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:46,380
We're going to go across the history, evolution, how chocolate is made, chocolate rolls out, new nutritional analysis,

10
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:55,320
some healthy compounds, research, chocolate and culture of my favorite chocolate things and universes.

11
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:59,840
And you guys come back here for okay? Yeah, they're me. I got a big mouth.

12
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,389
Don't be shocked. All right.

13
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,800
So let's use trace, though, the original word, chocolate.

14
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:14,670
Back to the Aztec culture and the word so tribal, which refers to a better drink, knows how beans.

15
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:19,080
Modern historians have estimated that chocolate has been around for nearly 2000 years.

16
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:24,540
Both the Mayans and the Aztecs, which we're talking about kind of Mexico into Central America there.

17
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:31,980
And buyers believe the cow bean had magical properties suitable for the use their most sacred of rituals.

18
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:42,030
So birth marriage man asked how sweet and chocolate did not appear until Europeans discovered it when tasting the native cuisine.

19
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,860
Hernando Cortez Uninvited guests conquer kingdoms.

20
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:53,700
A guy who fancied himself a food critic and decided it was awful and was a bitter drink.

21
00:01:53,700 --> 00:02:00,030
Just four pigs. However, he still took it back to Spain with him, where they improved upon it with honey and sugar.

22
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:06,030
And that was in the 16th century. And then by the 17th century it was all the rage in Europe.

23
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:11,700
And he drank, enjoyed by the most wealthy and elite because there was no mass production yet.

24
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,990
So until the steam engine came along, it was really not a drink for the masses.

25
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:21,420
But not until 1828 did chocolate become something other than a beverage.

26
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:29,999
In 1828, a Dutch chemist found a way to make powdered chocolate by removing about half the natural fat,

27
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,209
which we call cocoa butter from chocolate and polarizing it.

28
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:41,520
Which. Sorry,

29
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:49,950
pulverize what remained and treat it with a mixture of alkaline salts which took out the bitter taste and that product became known as Dutch cocoa.

30
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:55,740
For any of you that cook and you're in the baking. I'm not talking about hot cocoa mix, but actual cocoa powder.

31
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:56,819
There's two different kinds.

32
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:03,360
Usually there's an American wine and also a dusty brown, and there's what they call European or Dutch, and it has a really beautiful content to it.

33
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:11,970
And so I still make them all styles today. It wasn't until 1847 when Joseph Fry, who was a British physician.

34
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:19,230
I love how physicians got into the business in this time period because it was a guy named Kellogg here in Michigan who ran cereal sanatoriums.

35
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:28,410
So, so nice that doctors with the fact of food discovered that he could make a moldable chocolate by adding the cocoa butter back into the powder.

36
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:37,980
And then he had another little company you might have heard of it called Cadbury, caught on to this and started selling chocolate candies.

37
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:45,210
And then finally in 1875, another small Swiss chocolatier by the name Nestlé created the first milk chocolate.

38
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:51,630
All right, so how does this insane looking thing ever become a delicious dessert?

39
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:56,940
So the first thing is they take these pods and they open them up, and they take these, like, slimy looking seeds.

40
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:01,130
And and inside of them is a new type that is just like coffee.

41
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:07,620
It becomes fermented, roasted, and then ground. And in the case of chocolate's ground, even finer than coffee's,

42
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:14,430
then it becomes at least in texture and taste when heated, and it turns into a liquid which can be formed into bars,

43
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:23,570
chocolate cork and a 100% cocoa with no added ingredients under high pressure that pays the price of cocoa butter and Cocos Islands powder.

44
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:27,730
And despite the name chocolate liquor, it doesn't actually contain any alcohol.

45
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:33,600
It's just a very old use of the word corpse. So what's in a name?

46
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:40,380
We talk about the term cow that refers to something before processing, so those 18 parts would be called kick out.

47
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:45,120
The term chocolate used usually refers to something made from the beans.

48
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:51,600
So any of your sirups cocoa powder candy and then the term cocoa is the powdered process.

49
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:59,250
So then there's several different kinds of chocolates and maybe I'm passing them around.

50
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:02,640
All those styles are there. So the first one is white chocolate.

51
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:11,130
And according to the FDA, white chocolate must contain at least 20% cocoa butter, 40% milk and a whopping 55% sugar.

52
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:20,520
By chocolate's unique because this is exactly just what we think about the hand lotion because

53
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:28,710
Melbourne Cup the butter no chocolate is made by combining chocolate commissioner and adding milk.

54
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:29,910
And according to the FDA,

55
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:39,690
that definition for how chocolate must contain these 10% chocolate before and 12% dark chocolate is made from just two ingredients chocolate,

56
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:40,950
corn and sugar.

57
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:51,060
And according to the FDA, dark chocolate contains 15% chocolate liquor, but usually contains up to 50% chocolate before and it contains no dairy.

58
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:57,570
So it's a great vegan choice. Bittersweet, which is also sometimes called extra dark, but by the FDA,

59
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:04,200
is either considered bittersweet or semi-sweet must contain at least 35% chocolate before,

60
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,240
although they generally contain up to 50 and some even as much as 70%.

61
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:16,260
So this is chocolate by the numbers at 28 grams is about an ounce of can chocolate.

62
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:22,350
I don't know, it's just ounce, but sure. So this is for 70% dark chocolate.

63
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:34,020
It has 170 calories, just two, two grams of protein, 12 grams of fat, 13 grams of carbohydrates, three grams of fiber.

64
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:40,770
So not bad source of fiber. Sugars are about 6.8, has got saturated fats in it.

65
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:46,170
The really important one that we'll talk about in a minute is this carbon 18 saturated fat, which is citric acid.

66
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:51,629
It's got some cholesterol in it and then it has these three really important plant sterols

67
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:56,610
and is a natural can pastoral and beta sitosterol and want to talk about those as well.

68
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:02,010
Has 22 milligrams of caffeine. There is no drive for caffeine.

69
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:06,080
The FDA says anything under 400 milligrams is safe. I think we're all upset now.

70
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:14,460
If I was weak and then something called theobromine, which we're also going to talk about, which is an alkaloid, there's 227 milligrams of fat.

71
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:21,810
There's a little bit of calcium. This is dark chocolate had been white chocolate milk chocolate over 120 milligrams of calcium.

72
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:28,620
Still not a great source of calcium to be better. And you know, the white chocolate on iron and they're actually not bad.

73
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:37,430
Three grams of 18 you might eat by the day. So magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, sodium and selenium, plus going to health food.

74
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:41,370
So chocolate contains a variety of interesting compounds that researchers are investigating

75
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:45,600
to see if they need an extra pharmaceutical intervention for a variety of diseases cancer,

76
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:54,720
coughing, first citric acid. And the name shark acid actually comes in the great steer, which means tallow because it is typically a waxy,

77
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:59,490
solid fat that comes from animals, except for two exceptions.

78
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:05,400
And it's also found in cocoa butter and it is found in shea butter.

79
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:12,720
And notably citric acid is less likely to be converted last year and is associated with lower LDL compared to other saturated fats.

80
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:19,319
The next item that's really available in chocolate are plant sterols and there are

81
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:23,700
three different plants that are also to match Raul Castro and fitness disaster.

82
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:31,889
All president, dark chocolate and plant sterols have shown anti-inflammatory anti-diabetic and anti-cancer properties however they are sensitive to.

83
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:39,370
He's in the process of actually tempering chocolate to make you eat. Destroying the theobromine is the last one.

84
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:45,870
You hear a lot about it. If you look at this a little and you'll see there's no actual building in the bromine.

85
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:51,870
And that is because it actually comes from the main steel Brahma, which is the Greek word for the chocolate plant,

86
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:56,100
which means food of the gods, which I think is a really accurate name.

87
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:05,940
So it can actually cause the plant. And the health claims made for theobromine include its ability to raise HDL, quell coughing,

88
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:13,170
improve cardiovascular health and increase libido, which spoiler it does not.

89
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:18,630
So I found this really interesting piece of research.

90
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:25,350
It was a double blind, placebo controlled, randomized controlled trial investigating whether pure theobromine increases

91
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:30,509
serum HDL or whether it's an interaction between theobromine and flavonoids.

92
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:36,720
There have been a lot of research before this that was suggesting that was using a combination of the two or just the flavonoids.

93
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:44,220
So what they did in this intervention is they talk about for me, intervention was to eat right in Syria.

94
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:49,590
They're about 38 people in each group were women and men, 40 to 70 years of age.

95
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:55,310
Each day they got a 20 milligrams milliliter drink. They have one of these four things in it.

96
00:09:55,310 --> 00:10:02,270
One, obviously placebos and the overall mean one, they had just a natural what actually occurs in a cocoa beverage,

97
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:06,980
about 115 milligrams of the overall medium, 325 milligrams of flavonoids.

98
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:13,160
The overall mean only intervention has 850 milligrams of pure theobromine.

99
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:17,570
So that's like the equivalent of three one ounce candy bars, and then the theobromine,

100
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:23,600
a couple of thousand milligrams of sodium, 325 milligrams of flavonoids.

101
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:32,929
And what the analysis showed is that theobromine effect on HDL was statistically significant.

102
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:45,079
There was a 0.126 miles per liter increase, along with a increase in the apolipoprotein one, which is an indicator of HDL.

103
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:48,590
And it decreased both the LDL and the apolipoprotein.

104
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:58,460
And since it did not happen in the only intervention that they believe it is, I mean, that may be what's lowering HDL.

105
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:10,310
All right. Chocolate and culture. So in 2020, the global chocolate industry was worth $127.9 billion.

106
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:15,470
Your surprise, your Halloween is the most popular time of year to buy chocolate.

107
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:25,520
Americans spend on average $844.90 per cup, and the Swiss actually eat the most chocolate, £25.5 for a year.

108
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:32,270
Personally, I must be Swiss. Today looks like the bronze cow.

109
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:38,390
Although it was found in South and Central America and parts of Mexico, most of it's actually grown in the Ivory Coast and Ghana now.

110
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:47,450
And there's not a lot of issues you'll hear about people growing ethically safe beans because they're not always paid a living wage.

111
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:56,180
Same thing with coffee. So in 2017, Chocolatier Palomo, another French chocolatier, discovered a new species of cacao called ruby chocolate.

112
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,000
For those of you who have seen it and think it's just white chocolate,

113
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,920
the food coloring it as an act, its natural color, it is just a new species of skin cancer.

114
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:11,959
All right. So chocolate in cuisine, as we know it can be made into sirups, bars, powders, all kinds of things.

115
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,840
Just two of my favorite things. One is a classic chocolate chip cookie.

116
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:21,920
These were actually invented in 1938 in Massachusetts by some place you may have heard of the toll house in.

117
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:29,959
Eventually that Little Inn would sell the recipe rights to Nestlé, which was cemented as America's go to cookie recipe.

118
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:34,650
But America's chocolate chip. And the other recipe that I love is chicken mole.

119
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:41,120
So if you've never had it, this is really kind of takes it back to what the Aztecs used chocolate for.

120
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,349
So something that's really savory and spicy and again is something that you will

121
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:49,129
see people make to celebrate someone's graduation or a wedding or at a funeral.

122
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:52,280
It's really a celebratory dish and it's really delicious.

123
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:55,740
York Times is a really good recipe for anyone. Want to give a chicken mole like try?

124
00:12:58,430 --> 00:12:59,540
There you go. Question.

125
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:15,100
And in the research study that you reviewed, how did they control for like the taste of chocolate with the people they use chocolate flavoring.

126
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:20,860
So you tell us lots of things that are giving commercial guys that will have chocolate flavor.

127
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:33,820
So, yeah, you did give a little bit of a spoiler alert there for the libido, but I wonder if you could elaborate on that.

128
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:41,410
So really good question. So well, chocolate does not increase your libido or cause people to fall in love with you.

129
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:45,670
Researchers do believe there's actually some scientific reasons why people might think that.

130
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:50,360
The first is that chocolate has caffeine in it, and certainly a long time ago,

131
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:55,110
when they were using more concentrated levels of it for that average caffeine's a vasodilator,

132
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:58,180
your heart gets a beating that might feel like you're excited about something.

133
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:04,540
The other is, is that chocolate has tryptophan, which we'll be talking about today.

134
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:08,650
Your body used to produce serotonin and serotonin in your body.

135
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:16,450
You're relaxed, you're in a good mood. You're in a place that may also induce you to feel better about somebody and want to get cozy.

136
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:23,560
And the last is that it contains a compound called Phenyl Epsilon Mean, which acts in your body like an antibiotic.

137
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:34,450
So nature's Adderall. And when that happens in your body, it starts off you stop meaning your brain and your body is in pleasure seeking mode.

138
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:42,700
So someone brought you a box of chocolates and roses. It might happen, but there a chemistry, but not a lot.

139
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:53,170
Thank you. Kind of separate, but when you're looking, when you went over kind of the differences between white chocolate, dark chocolate, milk,

140
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:59,200
chocolate in terms of like nutrients and what could be beneficial if you were like prescribing someone like they said,

141
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:03,770
they're like, oh, I eat a lot of chocolate. I might as well get as much nutrients from it.

142
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:08,920
Like what? Which one would you choose? So my answer would be Dark chocolate is going to have the least amount of sugar.

143
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,940
It's going to be dairy free and it's going to have the highest levels of theobromine in it.

144
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:20,170
And why? Because it's got a richer flavor. It's more satisfying with less.

145
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:26,080
Well, what's your favorite chocolate bread? My favorite chocolate brand.

146
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:33,249
My favorite chocolate. So I'm a little biased. My husband proposed to me in front of Paradise Square in San Francisco 25 years ago.

147
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:39,290
So we keep your identity in the house. It may not be the best quality chocolate, but it.

148
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:44,630
It's got place in my heart. Yeah. Okay.

149
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:55,890
Chocolate because most people rather I don't know.

150
00:15:56,070 --> 00:16:01,920
I don't I can't really tell you. I know this is a little suspicious.

151
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:08,030
And I think the lady at the delicious surprise was that.

152
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,800
Oh, come in, everybody.

153
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:19,850
Thank you. Okay, so as you can probably guess.

154
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:27,280
So today's lecture, we're going to focus on this one little project right here that I kind of alluded to a little bit, but not indirectly.

155
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:31,129
So there is a bunch of compounds we use in a body that come from amino acid.

156
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:37,459
And these are all night sitting around this. Amino acids are primary source of nitrogen and they're involved in a whole bunch of different stuff.

157
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:43,520
So what I'm going to try to do today is just talk about a bunch of these in a sort of really brief vignette type form.

158
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:49,820
Some of these will cover in a lot more detail in future coursework, and obviously there's nothing I can spend that much time on.

159
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:57,530
So I brought them broadly into compounds to support metabolism and compounds that are precursors to a variety of hormones.

160
00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:02,959
So good. Thankfully, carnitine, creatine and nucleotides are all involved in various aspects of catabolism,

161
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:10,520
whereas acetylcholine, serotonin, melatonin and dopamine, norepinephrine are all very poor ones in our bodies.

162
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:14,629
And so all of these substances in normal function are things that our body can make,

163
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:20,210
but they're conditionally essential on at least one, sometimes more than one precursor amino acid.

164
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:26,570
This can be dropped from broad support, and usually these don't exist at super high level, especially relative to protein.

165
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:30,290
So it's pretty rare that a deficiency in protein will affect the ability to

166
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:34,279
make these much to the chagrin of everybody trying to sell you supplements.

167
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:37,370
And I think all of these somebody might want to tell you a supplement for all of them,

168
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:41,620
but usually the amount that we have in our free meanwhile, supply is sufficient to make organs.

169
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:46,190
It's pretty rare even in cases of protein restriction, that you're unable to make these compounds.

170
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:53,990
So we're historical today on these two sites, kind of a wrap up lecture because like we have these we've talked about at some point before.

171
00:17:54,200 --> 00:18:00,140
So what about going all the way back to the pen tools? Phosphate chunk like fruit is important for antioxidant defense.

172
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:08,650
So it is comprised of three amino acids that are grouped together, glutamate, 16 and glycine, and they're joined by peptide bonds by glued found.

173
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:16,099
So the case we talked a lot about this, about its role in oxidative stress and reducing active stress.

174
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:22,700
And you can measure the ratio of try to reduce good if I want to get a measure of the level of oxidative stress either in the water to tissue,

175
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:27,110
there's a reasonably common for sure experimental and somewhat laboratory measurements

176
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:31,670
trying to figure out what is the level of oxidative stress in an individual organ tissue.

177
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:36,320
It's also important for some chemical reactions. Not a ton of them, but a few.

178
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:43,790
So one example would be when we talk about the pupils,

179
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:50,240
pupils are converted into their active hormonal hormones by a series of cytokines and oxygen induced,

180
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:55,729
and whatever uses glutathione as a cofactor is to make some of these prostaglandins.

181
00:18:55,730 --> 00:19:03,799
You need to have good to find out in order to in this case solid liquid trying to see through at

182
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:08,160
Lugo trying to see for it pretty rare but it is used in some reactions that I'm just mentioning.

183
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:14,450
Just because we have to ask you from a tiny exam involved in a lot of read articles like 2 minutes ago now.

184
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:19,730
Cooley as you know, Colleen is like my favorite kind of essential sort of different thing coming on

185
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:24,590
here you are this hopefully remind you of phospholipids and the phospholipid unit.

186
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:30,650
We talk a lot about how it's important for lipid transport membrane biosynthesis through its role in hospital cooling,

187
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:35,930
but it also plays a role in methylation reactions, largely through a substance called better in which,

188
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:39,320
as I'll mention in a second, is a metabolite of of coaling.

189
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:43,910
It's an also an important girl's mean transmitter in the form of acetylcholine.

190
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:47,960
So there is a whole subset of neurons that signal through acetylcholine.

191
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:53,930
These are called cholinergic neurons, and they are important for a whole bunch of different things, including brain function.

192
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:59,150
And so having a deficiency of a colleague can cause fatty liver disease, as we talked about.

193
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:06,860
They can also affect the ability of neurons to signal and especially the ability of neurons to make neuronal connections during development.

194
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:13,120
And that's one make major role of general sales like muscle control and regulation in practice.

195
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:22,370
So this session here, I think is a pretty good, simple controlled study of Colleen in and women and children.

196
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:27,020
So what you're looking at here is the mean retention time. So a low reaction time.

197
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,439
A low reaction time sort of means like better learning in small children.

198
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:36,380
So they're sort of given a variety of different images and they're asked to react to lower means, like better neuronal function.

199
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:44,240
So in this study, they were randomized into collagen supplementation in the third trimester and you can see that had some effect.

200
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:50,990
So now and this is pretty recent, it's only as of 2020, Colleen is in almost all forms of infant formula.

201
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:54,950
It is not normally not in most prenatal vitamins.

202
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:59,570
Right. And again, about 50% of people require choline in their diet.

203
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:04,700
So they're not getting enough choline, especially if they're on a diet that is low in eggs, which is a very good source of protein.

204
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:10,370
There's a risk of colon aneurysm. There is a thought that the prenatal vitamins should contain.

205
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:13,640
There's not really any side effects of having too much at this point.

206
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:20,870
There is observational studies that suggest a coin levels are associated with prevention of memory loss in the elderly.

207
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:27,290
But again, these are observational studies. There's not good longitudinal studies on evidence stating that it should be excluded.

208
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:31,129
Why hasn't it been at this point a while as well?

209
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:35,870
So clearly there's only been known as being required since like not to get too personal.

210
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:40,280
When were you born? 2000. So basically within your lifespan.

211
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:45,080
So the so we hadn't known that choline was essential for anybody for very long.

212
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:48,079
So it's taken a long you know, sometimes we think of these vitamins, there's like,

213
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,590
oh, we've known this since like 1900 or 1700 in the case of vitamin C.

214
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:57,200
But Coley, we only figured out it was essential pretty recently and it only got dry and I think 2003.

215
00:21:57,410 --> 00:22:01,580
And so it's been a while for these studies to even get going. People didn't think of it as an essential need.

216
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:05,920
You know, my view is that it probably social substitution for about half people, right?

217
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,250
So maybe not everybody needs it.

218
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:12,319
You could make a case that people will eventually will know their genotype and know if they're require additional colon supplementation.

219
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,470
Maybe it becomes part of that, but yet it's not required right now.

220
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:19,340
So there is evidence for this. But this paper, you know, 2018 is reasonably new.

221
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:24,769
And any of the research you've seen on the elderly stuff is that like you have to start taking

222
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:30,169
it early for you see like a benefit or could someone who has memory loss start taking.

223
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:34,190
Yeah, so that's one of the there I know people were actually doing studies to test this,

224
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:40,730
especially in Alzheimer's patients to try to see if they can alleviate memory loss either as a primary or secondary intervention.

225
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,589
I don't think I've seen any compelling results on that. Not that it's not working. I think it's kind of the same point it daily.

226
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:49,969
We're just kind of getting started with these studies. These studies here are just looking longitudinally.

227
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:53,840
So looking at a blood sample clearly at some age and then asking about declining.

228
00:22:54,080 --> 00:23:02,570
So could be because the co-leader could be because of literally in that difference between all these other thoughts that it might it might be,

229
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:07,639
you know, relative to many other supplements, I generally think that there's probably going to be more benefits.

230
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:14,120
We're going to find himself many colleagues than, for example, carnitine or or put out because again, we're just starting to learn.

231
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:14,629
And again,

232
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:21,110
my guess is we're going to learn that this is going to be beneficial for the subset of people who are not endogenous production of fossil for.

233
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:27,250
Okay. So you can use this to kind of transition to as human cloning.

234
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:31,750
So one of the products of cooling metabolism, as you see here, is baby.

235
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:36,940
Now, you can directly consume many of these substances here, which is in the bullet cycle.

236
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:40,760
This is the bullet in climbing cycle here. Some of them can be contributed from the diet.

237
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:49,210
You can see the binding central amino acid you get from your diet. Folate are common in many foods that stop pregnant women beginning in college.

238
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:50,709
These are all things you might get.

239
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:57,310
And they feed into these excuse me, these two overlapping cycles and these type of play a role to generate a couple of key intermediates.

240
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:02,140
This five level take up is important, and then this epigenomic timing is also really important.

241
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:10,149
So as you consume these things, these help, they help make sure that there's enough products going into the cycle to recycle.

242
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:19,059
In this case, all cysteine abbreviated c y into the lining and the lining into what we're going to focus on today as a deal with Heidi,

243
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:22,900
which is going to be functionally important this this cycle.

244
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:29,290
And of course, this will come up a lot in if you take nutrition 631 and you can see all the vitamin B6, B12, colon, folate.

245
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:33,999
These are all these are all important contributors. One common metabolism for the purposes of now,

246
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,850
I'm going to focus on on Sam because Sam is going to be a methyl donor for a whole variety of different reactions.

247
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:43,000
So Sam works as a cofactor in a lot of different reactions.

248
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:48,940
And effectively what it does is it takes some substrate and adds a medical group to it, and there's going be a whole variety of these substrates.

249
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,760
Not this process doesn't work.

250
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:59,979
You can imagine this process could be impaired or the ability to recirculate sound through a whole variety of different deficiencies.

251
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:07,390
For example, you might not have an up the thigh, you might not have coli, you might not be eating, or you might not have a B12, B2 or B six.

252
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,270
So there's a lot of vitamins that can impair obstacle.

253
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:19,180
And so a lot of these reactions can be impaired due to dietary deficiencies and a lot of those impairments show up as homocysteine.

254
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:24,940
SS Right, because as you are unable to keep the cycle, you'll keep building up homocysteine here.

255
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:30,610
Okay. There was a video that I made I think is pretty good that I totally forgot to post to cannabis but is

256
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:34,179
now posted to cannabis to talk about one comment because I was confused when I was reading comments,

257
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:40,840
a person was like, I like make this like super clear. That also five year video that I had in my head that you guys have never seen anyone.

258
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:44,080
It is now it is now on campus. I would encourage you to go back to work.

259
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:52,780
It is great. I'm wearing the same shirt I always wear on videos and all the like.

260
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,440
So what is these these networks doing?

261
00:25:56,620 --> 00:26:02,500
So they do a bunch of things. They are important for making new nucleotides that are important for rapidly dividing cells.

262
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:06,190
Rapidly growing campus or offices.

263
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:09,940
They are important for generating the energy to energy ratio.

264
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:14,590
They are important for making certain proteins lipid head modification, for example,

265
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:21,399
adding the refining onto hospital ethanol need to make also the point it's important

266
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:26,200
for making good file reducing ROS proteins defibrillation and for epigenetics.

267
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:32,469
There's a lot of we haven't talked about epigenetics much in this past, but there's a lot of modifications of DNA that can regulate gene.

268
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:37,270
Transcription is one way we think that we can sort of program metabolism based on life experiences,

269
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:44,300
and a lot of that occurs through methylation of specific genes to turn or turn off gene transcription in a tissue specific branch.

270
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:50,170
And so folate and all of these other vitamins are important for supporting those methylation reactions.

271
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:57,360
Now it can be true to myself. I didn't mention that there is variance in people's requirements.

272
00:26:57,370 --> 00:27:03,490
These things, one very common variant is in this gene here and the age of does not stem what you think it stands for.

273
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:09,700
And there are many people in the population that at variance in this gene because that variance in this gene,

274
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:12,849
they're actually quite, quite a lot more folate supplementation. Right.

275
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:17,470
Because they can't rely on the recycling throughput or Betty, they require more dietary folate.

276
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:21,400
Right. And again, this is a relatively common mutation, about 30, 40%.

277
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:27,250
And again, if you want to know more about this in security one, the folate unit,

278
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:34,870
but it's incredibly important for that and promoted because as I mentioned deficiencies

279
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:40,089
in a lot of these folate Collin B12 b6b too often it show up as for most just anemia.

280
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:45,820
And so this study here is looking at the levels of homocysteine across different dietary patterns.

281
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:50,500
As you might expect, it's lowest in meat eaters because they're consuming quite a lot of B12,

282
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:53,830
whereas vegetarians and vegans may be consuming less B12.

283
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:57,579
So one of the reasons why people might monitor if you're on a vegan or vegetarian diet,

284
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:01,150
if you're getting enough B12 would be indirectly by looking at your homocysteine levels.

285
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:05,980
So that's a good indicator of whether or not you're able to recycle your Sam and your homocysteine.

286
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:11,019
Now, homocysteine has long been associated with cardiovascular disease, it turns out,

287
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:14,919
because it's responding to a bunch of different nutritional deficiencies and potential genotypes,

288
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:18,670
it was actually quite hard to figure out is it actually causal of cardiovascular disease.

289
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:26,559
But recent Mendelian randomization studies where people who are. Genetic changes that cause more severe have showed that that alone.

290
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:30,760
So the genetic change that's causing more cyst anemia is going to increase cardiovascular risk.

291
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:35,350
So it's very strong evidence that homocysteine is directly causal of cardiovascular risk.

292
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:43,010
On the other hand, holds is going to be is also associated with neural tube defects, but it is not causal of neural tube defects.

293
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:48,460
And again, we can tell that because people who are genetically elevated homocysteine don't have higher levels of neural tube.

294
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:55,390
That is because of folate. The lack of folate is the key thing for neural tube defects that's related to homocysteine.

295
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:57,879
But it is not the whole system that is the problem.

296
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:05,140
It it's actually the methyl CHF is the problem for people with neural tube defects generally for CCS increase,

297
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:11,050
we have low B12, low folate and variance in MPH of higher or extremely high thiamin intake.

298
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:19,470
All of these can result in in the cinema and can be treated by B12 supplementation as just an equivalent.

299
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:28,450
So. So basically you're saying is vegetarians and vegans have a higher chance of cardiovascular disease because of.

300
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:34,000
So you. No, I'm not saying that. I'm saying vegans and vegetarians have higher chance of homocysteine.

301
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:37,930
You're right. And homeless just anemia is cause of cardiovascular disease.

302
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:42,430
But vegetarians, vegans are also eating a lot of other things that are protective of cardiovascular disease.

303
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:45,900
So for example, very, very low levels of saturated fat.

304
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:50,800
Yeah. So there is like pretty good evidence of vegetarians being in somewhat much lower cardiovascular risk,

305
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:58,300
but that is being pushed against by the homocysteine. Yeah. And most people of cardiovascular disease are recommended to go.

306
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:05,259
So. Exactly. But but that is also why it's important if you're on a beacon diet and this is a mixture of vegans were something with B12 and not my

307
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:11,890
understanding is most well plant but vegan diets are supplementing with B12 at this stage so that maybe becomes less the case as time goes on.

308
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:15,440
But that's why it's important to look at these types of.

309
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,800
Okay. So that is acid, you know what I mean? Slash calling. Slash.

310
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:25,480
Okay. Next, Carmen, I want to talk about is carpeting again.

311
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:29,830
Hopefully this refreshes you from oxidation is living oxidation.

312
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:35,649
So carnitine is synthesized in the liver from lysine and also requires acid.

313
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:42,310
You know what? I knew it was an organ and that's caused by metal eating of the lysine reaction.

314
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:46,990
And then there's some more reactions involve vitamin C and iron that allow you to form carnitine.

315
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:49,960
So is dependent on deficiency of a lot of different things.

316
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:56,440
But there is no as I mentioned, back in those lipid oxidation units, there is no known biosynthetic error.

317
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:02,170
So there is no no difference metabolism of any of the enzymes that affect your Khanaqin are your ozone levels.

318
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:09,310
People which have low carnitine are because of carnitine, frankly, which means that even supplementation with carnitine is not effective.

319
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:12,670
This is the kind of thing you are going to get. Those are those are pretty rare.

320
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,370
Muscle is where most of the Carnegie leaves.

321
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:20,620
That's because that's where most of the lipid oxidation occurs, even though it is not made directly in the muscle.

322
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:24,760
Carnitine is extremely high in meat, which is your muscle.

323
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:28,750
Intellect was very high and it's important functionally for transporting fatty acids.

324
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,999
I have never seen a compelling piece of data.

325
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:38,260
The supplementation criteria for the study of oxidation in all of our lives is very, very, very, very common supplement that is sold out.

326
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:42,030
But again, I've never seen any evidence, probably because no people can make it on their own.

327
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:45,070
And chances are if they can't, it actually has nothing to do with carnitine,

328
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:51,520
it has more to do with and it's either B6, B3, iron or almost nobody is deficient of vitamin C.

329
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:57,250
But, you know, you already heard me asking the question, okay,

330
00:31:57,910 --> 00:32:02,530
a lot of what I'm going to talk about before we get to our research presentation for today is creatine.

331
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:10,330
So this goes back to the lecture on glycogen. So we've covered a lot of this stuff already and creatine phosphate is a short term energy source.

332
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,840
So creatine phosphate is a source of high energy intermediates.

333
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:21,040
As you deplete ATP, the first thing you do is you access to energy in the creatine phosphate bonds that quickly regenerates ATP.

334
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:25,690
This occurs very, very, very quickly within seconds the during exercise and depletes very,

335
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:29,469
very quickly, at which point you then have to engage in a heroic or anaerobic metabolism.

336
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:34,840
But that very first quick thing is usually through creatine and it gets regenerated very, very, very quickly.

337
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:44,320
Creatine is generated from a bunch of different amino acids, glycine, arginine, and they form the the the final substance.

338
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:48,940
Here again, you'll notice you're adding a metal group here, so you need as an intimidating right.

339
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:54,790
So again, this is just another example of how prevalent Arsenene with iron is in a whole bunch of different processes.

340
00:32:54,850 --> 00:33:02,319
Most creatine in our bodies are stored in skeletal muscle. We can generally make one or two grams per day and we excrete in very slowly.

341
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:08,469
Only one or 2% just varies a little bit because the breakdown product of creatine is creatine, which is excreted through the kidneys,

342
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:11,830
and there can be increased or decreased protein secretion depending on, okay,

343
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:16,030
there's a lot of dietary sources for creatine, but the best ones are meat and fish products.

344
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:20,410
But probably this is the most commonly supplemented thing we have.

345
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:24,340
There is no driver creatine because nobody needs it, but it is very commonly supplement.

346
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:28,660
So, you know, to come down, she is going to tell us about creatine supplement,

347
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:43,790
which is the exception to I always say supplements don't do anything except maybe not creating something we'll say off the bat.

348
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:50,770
Okay. You know, as you listen to my presentation.

349
00:33:55,170 --> 00:34:04,790
You'll hear me here. You talk to me in the back?

350
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:13,120
What I want you to and I'm going to elaborate a little bit on creatine as.

351
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:19,100
So. Well, actually, I'll just start with like some supplement facts.

352
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:22,970
I'm just real quick introduces you guys about like how it's used.

353
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:26,870
Secreted monohydrate is the most common form most by the study.

354
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:33,050
Like most effective as far as we know on the 2 to 5 gram serving size is typical with very minimal side effects.

355
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:36,920
This is one of the reasons why it's so favorable for people.

356
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:40,190
A couple of optional consumption strategies are to do a loading phase.

357
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:45,620
So this is like before you start with your small incremental supplementation, you do like a really big dose for about a week.

358
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,140
This isn't entirely necessary from what I can tell.

359
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:53,660
It seems like you're pretty high saturation level in your cells, quite consistent supplementation anyway.

360
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:57,920
But you might look at a start with a loading phase if you have a short term goal.

361
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:02,210
And then a lot of people also like to pair it with immune function protein.

362
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:07,040
There's like a little bit of evidence for like an insulin mediated like creatine transport.

363
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,709
But you might need like a lot of carbs to see a difference,

364
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:16,310
like like a hundred grams and then a couple other contributors to like how effective a supplement could be for an individual that I found.

365
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:21,830
Or just like a lot of these are intuitive, like how much you can get from your diet, how much you produce as an individual,

366
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:29,120
like small variations in your genetics, the type of exercise like the state of your muscles and like your organs.

367
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:33,319
So just real quick, some of them effects of the primary use.

368
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:37,070
The reason that most people use creatine is for its muscle building properties.

369
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:41,390
So it's like creation is highly marketed for this reason, primarily.

370
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:50,209
Guarantee you any general worth the salt like a strike you at some point and like it's puppy but not like for no reason.

371
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:55,520
There is a lot of evidence to support like the increased ability to do exercise and like performance and muscle building.

372
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:59,929
So I'm not going to go into this a lot today, but it is pretty well understood.

373
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:05,270
What is a little bit less well understood. I was really curious to look into is the effect the creating has on a brain.

374
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:12,049
So a lot of people suspect that creatine is good for your brain because your right is a lot of energy.

375
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:19,130
You express creatine kind of in your brain and people that don't express screeching the ratio a lot of like neurological damage and like delays.

376
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:23,780
So I think people understand that like creatine is important for your brain.

377
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:29,569
Other people want to know the nuances of that and they want to understand like specifically a dietary supplement will have an

378
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:36,400
impact on your brain because there are a lot of people are finding is that your brain is not quite as responsive to an explosion,

379
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:40,130
a supplement as your muscles are, as this is shown in the study like this.

380
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:48,300
So in this study this just shows like differences in like creating a diet.

381
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:51,040
This is expected. Vegetarians don't get as much decrease in their diet.

382
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:56,049
And this discrepancy is normally also visible and muscle cells, but surprisingly not in the brain.

383
00:36:56,050 --> 00:37:03,520
This is not what people were predicting. So most healthy adults, regardless of their diet, will show about the same amount of creatine in the brain.

384
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:07,320
And the brain also appears to like make a little bit of creatine on its own.

385
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:12,010
So it kind of suggests like a more tightly controlled regulation of the creatine levels in the brain.

386
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:17,920
And what this means for supplementation is that in order to see an effect from creatine supplement on the brain,

387
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:23,020
you might need a higher dose than you would for like a muscle growth goal,

388
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:27,729
or you need like a significant stretch or something that would deplete recruiting levels to

389
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:31,990
the point where you like the brain might become more receptive to like an exact source.

390
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:42,340
So we'll look at this idea of stress, like to to kind of look at facets of brain function, look at cognitive function first.

391
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:46,690
So that is the effect like the stressor,

392
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:55,809
it seems pretty clear from looking at the body and like random healthy participants and have them do like a bunch of cognitive tests like memory,

393
00:37:55,810 --> 00:38:03,610
like complicated math test, things like that. Most of the trials showed a very modest improvement in these cognitive skills.

394
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:05,290
Memory was the one that was most consistent.

395
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:12,430
Not all of these skills are consistent, but shows potential for maybe like a little bit of improvement for healthy individuals.

396
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:19,930
But then this effect was much more pronounced when you add an acute stressor in situations like you have to take those same like math test,

397
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:24,520
but like really sleep deprived or like like low oxygen environments.

398
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:34,800
When these stressors were added, it was like so a decrease in cognitive ability because of stressors like creatine seem to save that a little bit,

399
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:37,900
like have like a bit of a protective factor there.

400
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,620
So if creatine is going to be used for like health and cognitive function,

401
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:48,910
it seems like it has the most potential for people to anticipate being in like an acute and acute stress environment.

402
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:54,940
But this doesn't have as many as many trials or studies as like muscle growth studies.

403
00:38:55,660 --> 00:39:03,100
So this is like acute stress. We'll look at something that was a bit more complicated to draw conclusions from and that's like more chronic stress,

404
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:06,400
like something you'd see in like psychiatric disorders.

405
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:14,200
So I was trying my best to summarize what I found, but it was like there is some contradictory like data here.

406
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:18,670
For most psychiatric disorders, it appears that there are creating abnormalities in the brain,

407
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:26,950
but it's yet to be determined if that's a good therapeutic target or if those creating abnormalities are like a downstream effect,

408
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:28,840
like a bigger and bigger problem,

409
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:34,120
and then like targeting creatine wouldn't actually be very useful for those patients, but people are looking into it.

410
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:40,870
People seem so most optimistic about using creatine for like post-traumatic stress and brain trauma

411
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:46,060
and depressive disorders because both of those showed some evidence for symptom improvement.

412
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:52,570
But this wasn't always consistent. So more trials actually need to be done, particularly with depressive disorders,

413
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:59,290
which didn't always show changes in grade creatine and in a couple of cases show kind of contradictory results,

414
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:03,190
like people had an increase in depressive symptoms.

415
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:06,010
So these should need to be looked into.

416
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:11,110
But they're like, I guess so most thing that's being cited the most right now, what people are most interested in.

417
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:16,899
There's also neurodegenerative diseases which kind of had similar results, like there was some evidence of like a neuroprotective factor,

418
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:22,780
maybe like an anti oxidative factor in some mouse models, but this wasn't always consistent.

419
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:29,820
And then schizophrenia and anxiety didn't show a great effects are like an improvement from the supplements.

420
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,990
I thought it was interesting that like for most of them they showed like an asymmetry

421
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:39,190
in like how much creatine was in like the right or left side of the brain. But that was interesting.

422
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:45,130
And then with bipolar disorder and especially like the manic episodes,

423
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:52,120
it was shown that people in manic episode had higher rates of commuting and there was like a couple of

424
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:59,050
reported cases where people were people reported that they were triggered in a manic episode as a pre-teen.

425
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:08,830
So this also needs to be looked into more. It's possible that people some people are really susceptible and they should look out for creatine.

426
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:14,079
But in general, this is unfortunately not super conclusive.

427
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:18,760
But people are very excited to look into this because it's kind of like a new field right now.

428
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:26,379
Unfortunately, there's also a lot of limitations that are of a lot of the brain creatine studies.

429
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:33,100
The biggest one is that are like one of the biggest ones is that optimal dosing hasn't really been established for cognitive goals versus most goals,

430
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:39,790
but most people agree that it should be like higher. And this is in line with most cognitive studies that use higher doses than muscle receives.

431
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:47,570
There's also now. Super great methods are now profession created in different parts of the brain in people that are alive.

432
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:53,630
And so a lot of like mental health studies measured creating on its own biometric creating and ratio.

433
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:57,030
Something else which can be a possible confounder of that component is also changing.

434
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:06,540
And then really importantly, not a lot of studies will show the effect of the supplement, both on cognitive results and on brain creating levels.

435
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:12,490
So it's. Well, hopefully this makes sense.

436
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:19,870
Like the way I diagrams like all these in gray, like all the studies that I looked at, like had one of these three like, setups, kind of.

437
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:23,650
So they only looked at like two of the components, not a lot looks at all three.

438
00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:28,120
It would be really important to be able to kind of connect those three dots and know for sure.

439
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:28,719
Like, for example,

440
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:34,660
if you did something approaching segment and you see improvements in their depressive symptoms like is it because of a change in green proteins?

441
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:39,309
Like do we know can we target that is like a therapeutic method now or did recruiting not change?

442
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:45,360
And that's because of something else, like an indirect effect on carbon metabolism or like an exercise confounder.

443
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:49,210
Not all studies like control for exercise in the same way or controlled for it at all.

444
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:55,600
So I think people are aware of this limitation. So I'm excited to see like what comes out.

445
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:59,829
I'm like invested now, but for now,

446
00:42:59,830 --> 00:43:05,350
like some conclusions that you're comfortable making are that creatine seems to be great for like performance and muscle building.

447
00:43:05,350 --> 00:43:12,159
For most people. It's probably good for silent cognitive functions, most noticeably under stress condition,

448
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:16,450
but the fact seems minimal and that it may or may not be good.

449
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:36,149
I mean, that's all. Thank you all for your time. So for the bipolar disorder that participants have established by phone disorder

450
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:41,640
and confounders like medication use that could affect kidney clearance.

451
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:47,610
So if medication is one of the biggest confounders, are the reasons that mental illness so difficult to do like they,

452
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:50,790
I think at one point took a bunch of like really high medications and showed that

453
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:54,210
they all changed creatine levels and some in like different directions too.

454
00:43:55,440 --> 00:44:00,120
So the medication is definitely something that people are trying to be better controlling for,

455
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:07,259
but it's really hard to tell someone, Hey, don't go on your medication for eight years and see what happens to the bipolar one.

456
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:15,180
I think they did like the cases. I looked at the time pre-established like I'm not for this one.

457
00:44:15,450 --> 00:44:22,300
Okay. Do you remember was that like always call with our reason.

458
00:44:22,390 --> 00:44:25,500
You said that was higher preaching in the brand. Yeah. So that was also one.

459
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:30,070
Yeah. I think because I don't think there's a way to by language.

460
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:42,520
Yeah. So that's another confounder. Do you know how like much before you you have to take creatine?

461
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:46,450
Is it different in the brain than for, like, muscle? Just think so.

462
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:53,170
Timing isn't like I didn't find any good evidence for timing, which is why I didn't include it in like the supplement facts before.

463
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:59,740
The most compelling one I saw was like, take it with a meal or take it after exercise because of increased blood flow.

464
00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:05,200
But I think most people agree that creatine is like a chronic supplement and not like acute supplements.

465
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:08,650
So like consistency is probably more impactful than timing.

466
00:45:09,850 --> 00:45:12,879
And I think that would be the case for brain stuff as well as just for grain stuff.

467
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:27,250
You might either have to wait longer or higher just to see. So if you had someone come to you and say, I'm taking some creatine,

468
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:34,569
someone's to help me study way lower your recommendation, like they come to me like wanting to take creatine.

469
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:38,170
And I so answer like the main slide is what you're saying.

470
00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:47,520
So it's well, one, I would I would definitely have them consult with like if they have a doctor psychiatrist,

471
00:45:47,530 --> 00:45:51,280
I'd like to categorize like mental health. So you might want to talk to the dietitian.

472
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,349
I'll probably take on like a case by case basis.

473
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:57,819
Like if they seem like they're at a stable point in their mental health treatment, like their doctor clears them,

474
00:45:57,820 --> 00:46:05,950
like I'd have them try it if they I would really only recommend creatine for yourself if there's like a significant stressor.

475
00:46:05,950 --> 00:46:14,589
That was the condition that shows the most like improvement in like the most significant results if they like, have a satisfying schedule.

476
00:46:14,590 --> 00:46:25,060
Like I wouldn't necessarily recommended for like I don't think it would be like as soon as you have.

477
00:46:41,570 --> 00:46:48,620
Okay. So what we're going to do now is. That was a lot of that was all the met all mentioned pertinent comment I want to cover.

478
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:55,760
So what I want you guys to do is spend 5 minutes or so and this is a great to be like you do it on your own.

479
00:46:57,380 --> 00:47:00,050
So I want you to pick one of those things we talked about, for example,

480
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:03,830
in creatine or carnitine and just kind of go do a little mini review for yourself.

481
00:47:03,830 --> 00:47:08,930
What does it contain? What are the dietary sources other what is it you one?

482
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:15,919
And then based on what it does, what you might predict if somebody turned out they were deficient in in one of these things I probably deficient

483
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:42,680
in alcohol spend about 5 minutes on that and then we'll finish up with the neurotransmitters it's just.

484
00:48:00,000 --> 00:49:20,360
To. And because, look, the National Guard, usually it's much more than what it needs to be known.

485
00:49:25,010 --> 00:49:35,820
I think that's typical.

486
00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:43,680
Yeah. Do you remember how you do that?

487
00:49:44,490 --> 00:49:48,300
I do. 10 minutes to that one.

488
00:49:50,710 --> 00:50:18,490
I hope you're not using it to see me, so I'll just try and make sure you know that that's how we have to remember that over time.

489
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:23,589
But this thing is a different thing, you know?

490
00:50:23,590 --> 00:50:31,590
No different. But yes, I mean, I suppose, you know, we utilize bleach.

491
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:40,440
I mean, that's a missile that we can see a lot of things.

492
00:50:43,290 --> 00:51:02,790
So it seems like the problem is, is that, you know, the 16 year old.

493
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:10,310
She's to.

494
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:25,190
Right. Which is?

495
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:34,370
Which is what it seems.

496
00:51:35,110 --> 00:51:55,020
If you can only do so much as you to see.

497
00:51:55,860 --> 00:52:05,319
Okay. All right. So the for the poll for the final vote, voting was like wildly close.

498
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:09,120
It was like 19 to 21. But then three people told me they voted for the wrong thing.

499
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:18,120
So the real actual voting was 22 to 18 or older than the majority by like a bare majority.

500
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:22,230
So we're going to go with Thursday 4 to 6 in this room.

501
00:52:22,410 --> 00:52:29,250
Okay. Because I'm going to go with the majority. The if you cannot make Thursday between four and six,

502
00:52:29,250 --> 00:52:35,159
email me and we'll make separate arrangements and please email me soon so that I can

503
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:41,750
make arrangements and I'll will send in a post reminder to quiet for the majority.

504
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:45,810
Hopefully it's Thursday, 4 to 6 in this physical rush.

505
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:52,979
All right. I can't believe it was that close. I totally figured it was going to be like, okay, I'm glad it wasn't 5050.

506
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:55,799
That works out. So okay.

507
00:52:55,800 --> 00:53:01,950
So the last part that I'm going to talk about, actually, last thing we've talked about all year is going to be neurotransmitters.

508
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:04,619
So I'm going to start with something that I think is super obvious,

509
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:08,939
but I feel like every single something like selling company thinks is not there is no evidence that

510
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:15,240
either amino acid supplementation or protein supplementation modifies brain neurotransmitter levels,

511
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:18,840
period. Right. I've never seen any good data on this at all.

512
00:53:19,050 --> 00:53:23,640
So even though you may be told that tyrosine is the precursor for dopamine and dopamine makes you happy,

513
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:25,380
there is no evidence that that's going to happen.

514
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:33,090
Meat may make you happy, even take entirety may make you happy, but it probably does not do it by increasing your or your serotonin levels.

515
00:53:33,330 --> 00:53:40,020
But these are required for these neurotransmitters. So I'm going to start with serotonin, which comes from tryptophan,

516
00:53:41,270 --> 00:53:49,259
as you see there it is two step reaction hydrogenation and the d carboxylic acid which starts with trip to find it and turns it into serotonin.

517
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:53,069
So serotonin is important for a lot of things. It's an exciting neurotransmitter.

518
00:53:53,070 --> 00:53:59,850
It's a beta constrictor. It affects mood, appetite, blood pressure. Going back, 95% of the serotonin in your body is your gastrointestinal tract.

519
00:53:59,850 --> 00:54:03,270
And that is entirely unrelated to the amount of serotonin in your brain.

520
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:07,650
The rate limiting step for serotonin production is dependent hydrogels.

521
00:54:08,190 --> 00:54:12,780
And so tissues that are the that are drawn serotonergic neurons are can be identified

522
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:17,669
by having high levels of VH and they regulate to promote their production.

523
00:54:17,670 --> 00:54:22,260
Now, we've known for a long time that serotonin levels in the brain were associated with depression.

524
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:26,580
And so there's two classes of compounds that have been used as antidepressants.

525
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:33,720
One are mono maybe oxidase inhibitors, so they prevent the removal of the hydroxyl group right there.

526
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:36,990
They actually work on dopamine as well as we'll talk about it.

527
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:44,040
And then the other classes are SSRI, which are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as Prozac.

528
00:54:44,310 --> 00:54:46,799
Those prevent the uptake of serotonin.

529
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:54,000
So in both cases, what they're doing is lengthening the amount of time, the sear on the serotonin is in the entire neural space.

530
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,410
Right. So it keeps signaling by keeping serotonin in that space between the two.

531
00:54:57,420 --> 00:55:05,219
So the idea is it promotes more neuronal firing. You may have seen over the summer there was some debate about is this actually really the mechanism?

532
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:09,930
There's some evidence maybe that is not actually the mechanism by which these things work as antidepressants.

533
00:55:10,170 --> 00:55:14,580
But I'm not enough of a neural psychologist to know of that is is true but these are

534
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:20,879
especially SSRI as are extremely widely prescribed because depression is incredibly common.

535
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:27,120
Now this is already out of date. This is 2019. Everything I've seen, including a recent disturbing New York Times article about children and adults,

536
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:30,840
not as much out of an 18 year old or a 16 year old at home.

537
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:35,220
He you know, levels of depression increased a lot through the pandemic.

538
00:55:35,490 --> 00:55:37,910
And so, therefore, not only are there a lot more people, France,

539
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:42,809
but a lot more people who are on medication, there is a sex difference in the levels of depression.

540
00:55:42,810 --> 00:55:50,549
This has been stable for as long as I've seen this data, where women tend to have depression at about 30% higher rates than men.

541
00:55:50,550 --> 00:55:53,970
And because of that here and it's not anti-depressants at higher rates than men,

542
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:59,309
there's a whole bunch of common potential antidepressants are just listed here.

543
00:55:59,310 --> 00:56:03,930
In case you're more familiar with their names, the most common ones are SS Horizon and Arise.

544
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:10,319
TCAS are very rarely prescribed and males are even less readily prescribed these days.

545
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:14,120
But all of these classes are. Our food with an apology for the problem.

546
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:19,610
And it will work largely by affecting either serotonin or simply awful levels in the brain.

547
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:22,050
They all tend to work pretty non specifically, right?

548
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:26,870
Because it's like all this your tone in the brain, not just the serotonin, the one part of the brain that you're trying to maybe work on.

549
00:56:26,870 --> 00:56:36,230
But that's how groups work. Okay. Melatonin, which I mentioned a little bit in our post-Thanksgiving class, is a further product from serotonin.

550
00:56:36,470 --> 00:56:42,530
So you not only need to make serotonin, but then you need to make melatonin through one extra step or two extra steps after that.

551
00:56:43,010 --> 00:56:47,870
And as I mentioned in that class, melatonin is really important for the onset of sleep, right.

552
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:54,530
So a lot of people for most people, one of the waking responses is as lights go on, your belt, go way down.

553
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:59,690
Now, there's lots of evidence that melatonin can help with sleep and treatments.

554
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:03,770
And there's been a lot a lot of studies that using placebo controlled studies so that you

555
00:57:03,770 --> 00:57:08,149
can give no time to somebody that would like increase the likelihood that they go to sleep.

556
00:57:08,150 --> 00:57:14,530
It will also increase the likelihood that they sleep for longer. Many, many, many people do not get good sleep hygiene.

557
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:15,640
And so these are very common.

558
00:57:15,650 --> 00:57:23,900
Melatonin, as we know, can be powerful with effectively no regulation, which is I don't know how many of you agree about that.

559
00:57:25,820 --> 00:57:32,300
Another thing that can impact sleep and this works directly through melatonin, as shown here, is just the avoidance of light, right?

560
00:57:32,330 --> 00:57:35,659
So the avoidance of blue light, that's one of the reasons why they suggested not to look at lights,

561
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:45,050
actually screens or phones report that bright light prevents the induction of melatonin is considered a supplement,

562
00:57:45,110 --> 00:57:48,260
not a drug, which is why you might get some sleep.

563
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:52,220
I feel like. Are we sure? Like, what's the difference here?

564
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:56,359
But they're super, super commonly used. 20% of people claim they've used in the past year.

565
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:59,360
8% of people claim they've used it in the last week. Right. So very, very,

566
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:02,980
very commonly used does help does work with sleep disorders has increased from

567
00:58:02,990 --> 00:58:06,130
effectively I had never heard of when I was in graduate school to you know,

568
00:58:06,140 --> 00:58:09,590
over $1,000,000 worth of sales is going to 2020.

569
00:58:10,130 --> 00:58:14,880
As you might expect, there are some side effects like sleepiness because you know, it's like what and stuff.

570
00:58:15,020 --> 00:58:18,380
So melatonin is, like I said, very, very, very common.

571
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:22,910
And again, there's no evidence that having more serotonin has any connection to having more melatonin,

572
00:58:22,910 --> 00:58:29,989
much less having more tryptophan, has any relationship with with melatonin.

573
00:58:29,990 --> 00:58:35,320
And certainly the other class here are the energy and metabolism.

574
00:58:35,630 --> 00:58:39,230
So going back to PMK, to everybody's favorite enzyme,

575
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:45,050
responded to adrenaline and to adrenaline is a piracy derivative and involves multiple steps past.

576
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:50,030
The opening admonition. Signaling, as we've talked about pretty extensively, is really important for the policies.

577
00:58:50,030 --> 00:58:53,450
Gluconeogenesis look at oxidation.

578
00:58:53,660 --> 00:58:59,210
They regulate blood pressure and heart rate through sort of like non nutritional pathways, but through a sympathetic activation.

579
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:04,640
So that's what the hydrogen signaling does and went all the way through to make adrenaline or noradrenaline.

580
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:09,800
Dopamine, on the other hand, which is sort of the precursor metabolite, is a basal dilator in the gut.

581
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:13,580
It's much like serotonin. There's high levels of protein in the gut.

582
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:14,989
Also like serotonin,

583
00:59:14,990 --> 00:59:22,280
there is no relationship between gastrointestinal dopamine and central dopamine is generally a happy moment is supposed to make you feel good.

584
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:29,390
So it's often prescribed as both an antipsychotic antidepressant as it is given as that.

585
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:34,459
And then antagonists tend to be treatments for bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and antipsychotics.

586
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:39,920
So again, sort of like reducing the frenzy that might be associated with excess pleasure.

587
00:59:39,950 --> 00:59:44,570
Right. And so it is adrenaline, the same thing as epinephrine or they just yeah,

588
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:49,550
I think it's like a Canada US thing that we always call epinephrine, norepinephrine.

589
00:59:49,550 --> 00:59:57,850
And in America, I think they call it drugs like a metric system thing or climate that's we're using the word or like just a general thing,

590
00:59:57,980 --> 01:00:01,190
but they mean the same thing. I've been in America my entire life, so I don't know why.

591
01:00:01,190 --> 01:00:06,530
I didn't know if it was this. I feel like if you call it epinephrine, you sound a little bit like, okay, just a little bit.

592
01:00:06,530 --> 01:00:11,660
Not by a lot people. Just a little bit. Yeah. No, it's never the adrenaline our underlying the the same thing.

593
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:21,979
Okay. Anyways, so monoamine oxidase inhibitors, they work on both trip fat and on top of me and they work by preventing the breakdown of dopamine.

594
01:00:21,980 --> 01:00:30,620
So the normal way by which would stabilize dopamine is by this oxidase reaction, which is going to get rid of the free hydroxyl group here.

595
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:35,089
And so as you do that, that if you prevent that, if you inhibit this oxidation,

596
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:42,140
this breakdown of dopamine or serotonin, and that keeps it more active in the the neurotransmitter.

597
01:00:42,470 --> 01:00:46,070
So this was one of the first antidepressants that came out.

598
01:00:46,070 --> 01:00:53,090
Again, they're not super commonly used. Now, it turns out we have this enzyme auto immune oxidase, not necessarily only for dopamine.

599
01:00:53,090 --> 01:00:57,770
We also use it to break down a bunch of other substances that have sort of excess hydroxyl groups.

600
01:00:57,770 --> 01:01:04,130
And one of those is a chemical called tyramine, which, as you can see, looks much like this hydrazine.

601
01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:11,360
Right, is just missing the provocative right here. So tyramine is found in dietary sources such as cheese especially.

602
01:01:11,430 --> 01:01:14,430
Like all these cheese beers, some alcohol, some.

603
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:21,630
Now, one of the challenges, if you're on an MRI, is that you also need to get rid of this hydroxyl group on Tierney.

604
01:01:21,870 --> 01:01:26,430
And if you do not do that, you'll have a buildup of Tierney in your body, potentially, especially in your brain.

605
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:29,940
And this is the fun sounding but unpleasant cheese crisis.

606
01:01:30,090 --> 01:01:33,270
So if you want to know why you're not supposed to eat cheese,

607
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:39,150
because I can cause a gulp of tyramine that in turn has the inability for you to break down dopamine and adrenaline.

608
01:01:39,150 --> 01:01:47,750
And so you get symptoms of hyper adrenaline. So heart increase, heart rate flushing, blood pressure, headaches, any severe cases, an average crisis.

609
01:01:48,030 --> 01:01:51,660
So people who are on email wise are often prescribed to not eat cheeses.

610
01:01:51,990 --> 01:01:54,899
I think this is kind of a fun example of, you know,

611
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:59,940
a food substance because nothing in theory we don't need to worry is one of these kinds of things that our body takes in.

612
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:06,450
But we have to deal with what it can cross, react with pharmacology in a way that historically wouldn't have really been a big issue.

613
01:02:06,450 --> 01:02:12,420
But now in if you're prescribing to me why in the world has some side effects, right.

614
01:02:12,570 --> 01:02:17,220
And there's an activity if you want to explore this a little bit more. Okay.

615
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:23,670
So that's it. So that's all I have for you, for nitrogen containing compounds here.

616
01:02:24,090 --> 01:02:28,650
So anyways, so like I said, the key thing I want you to remember is these are all precursors,

617
01:02:28,830 --> 01:02:33,300
but there is almost no evidence for any of these precursors, supplementation, having any biological.

618
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:37,920
They're important. You need it, but you don't need to get to the end. Now, before you want you to take a moment.

619
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:41,210
And I want you to think, Casanova, because there's no work done on.

620
01:02:44,540 --> 01:02:50,240
And, you know, I put a lot of burden on the technical side of this course because there's a lot of moving parts here.

621
01:02:50,390 --> 01:02:55,460
But I think she did a wonderful job of getting things working in Ireland and helping us keep up with all the great.

622
01:02:55,580 --> 01:02:59,770
And I'd like to thank all of you for all of your work over the semester. And we'll see most of you, hopefully on Thursday.

623
01:02:59,780 --> 01:03:03,259
Do not forget Thursday. Unless you know me, sir. Okay, now you can.

624
01:03:03,260 --> 01:03:03,470
Sure.
