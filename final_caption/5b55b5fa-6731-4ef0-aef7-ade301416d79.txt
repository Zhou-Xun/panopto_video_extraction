1
00:00:02,954 --> 00:00:07,954
thank you all, that are signed in so far.

2
00:00:07,954 --> 00:00:13,954
We're going to go ahead and get started and, you know, welcome, others as they join.

3
00:00:13,954 --> 00:00:16,954
And then can get caught up.

4
00:00:16,954 --> 00:00:27,954
Thank you for coming to this workshop, titled follow the yellow brick road, using yellow dig, to create a social learning community.

5
00:00:27,954 --> 00:00:43,954
We are recording this session, so that we can share it with you all afterward, get anyone caught up who needed to join late, or if you have to take off early will also be sharing it on our resilient teaching Canvas site, alongside some of our other workshop

6
00:00:43,954 --> 00:00:44,954
recordings.

7
00:00:44,954 --> 00:00:54,954
And I just want to note, because will mention it a few times the resilient teaching Canvas site is a resource created by the instructional services team.

8
00:00:54,954 --> 00:01:00,954
Initially during the switch to remote learning at the start of the pandemic.

9
00:01:00,954 --> 00:01:06,954
But we've continued to update this as we continue to be resilient.

10
00:01:06,954 --> 00:01:10,954
Now transitioning back for some people.

11
00:01:10,954 --> 00:01:19,954
So you may hear us reference this resource site and we'll make sure you will have a link to this in the follow up materials that we share.

12
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:32,954
My name is Joanna, come back of it, I'm an Instructional Technology consultant on the SPH instructional services team. And I'm presenting today with a colleague who I will let introduce herself.

13
00:01:32,954 --> 00:01:44,467
Hi everybody, my name is Monica Rosen, I'm one of the instructional designers for the instructional services team too so I also help with designing and developing those courses, and along with Joanna implementing technology with those courses.

14
00:01:46,814 --> 00:02:00,814
So our plan for the next hour is we're going to talk about what yellow dig is, you're going to get to try yellow dig yourself, we're going to discuss how to get started and cover some best practices.

15
00:02:00,814 --> 00:02:15,814
And then we are so, so happy to have some yellow to users here with us and they are going to share about their experiences and allow us to learn from what they have done.

16
00:02:15,814 --> 00:02:19,814
So, what is yellow dig,

17
00:02:19,814 --> 00:02:25,814
and maybe even more importantly, why do we need another discussion tool.

18
00:02:25,814 --> 00:02:34,814
We have Canvas discussions. Our team has hosted training sessions on jam board and peruse all the university now has slack.

19
00:02:34,814 --> 00:02:47,814
Why would we ask you to take a look at yet another discussion tool, and our short answer is that they all have different strengths and weaknesses that might lead you to choose one or the other.

20
00:02:47,814 --> 00:02:53,814
But as we switch to remote learning. And now back to sort of semi in person.

21
00:02:53,814 --> 00:03:10,814
We're always looking for ways that students can create community in the classroom. And this is one thing that yellow did can do really well. In fact yellow did calls their discussion boards, communities, and this term is intentional.

22
00:03:10,814 --> 00:03:26,814
A lot of our discussion today, and how we talk about best practices and such is going to be geared towards using yellow dig in academic courses. But that's not all, it can do you can get creative with yellow dig it can be used outside of Canvas, or graded

23
00:03:26,814 --> 00:03:33,814
environments, and we'll be able to share some more examples of that later. Towards the end of our time.

24
00:03:33,814 --> 00:03:38,814
And so,

25
00:03:38,814 --> 00:03:58,814
some unique things about yellow dig is yellow dig is designed to foster collaborative cooperative social learning, even with its look alone the actual design looks and feels like a social media platform with features that are familiar to a lot of users

26
00:03:58,814 --> 00:04:00,814
who use those platforms.

27
00:04:00,814 --> 00:04:10,814
And all of this makes that back and forth, more natural than say a tool such as the canvas discussion board.

28
00:04:10,814 --> 00:04:30,814
You look helps reshape student behavior, about how they feel about meeting discussion and participation requirements. It allows us to break out of this post once and reply to two tiers models, primarily in one way by incentivizing engagement with others

29
00:04:30,814 --> 00:04:36,814
using a point system. And we'll talk a lot about this.

30
00:04:36,814 --> 00:04:48,814
Because of this point system. It also lowers the burden on instructors to be monitoring and and assessing who's engaging who isn't who's completed all the requirements for the post and who hasn't.

31
00:04:48,814 --> 00:04:57,814
As a result, you're going to use the instructor or facilitator you're going to be able to get engaged in a different way.

32
00:04:57,814 --> 00:05:05,814
You're going to get reports, to be able to identify students who sort of falling off the radar, so to speak, and you can reach out.

33
00:05:05,814 --> 00:05:22,814
There's also a feature we can use called reminders, meaning you could set this up to nudge students to send them a little reminder email automated from yellow Digg if they haven't participated in a certain range of time that it will automate a message.

34
00:05:22,814 --> 00:05:35,814
Yellow Brick also fosters a different kind of relationship between the instructors and students. When an instructor is no longer sort of the hall monitor of the discussion board.

35
00:05:35,814 --> 00:05:45,814
It allows students to pose questions, and share articles and the instructor can then participate and engage in that alongside the students.

36
00:05:45,814 --> 00:06:05,814
Additionally, another way students can interact in yellow dig is using a feature called accolades, which allows you to almost give awards on posts and comments and we'll show you that when we jump into our resilient teaching theology community.

37
00:06:05,814 --> 00:06:15,814
And finally yellow dig aligns with a lot of evidence based practices in teaching and learning and principles of trauma informed pedagogy.

38
00:06:15,814 --> 00:06:18,814
If you're not familiar with this or these terms.

39
00:06:18,814 --> 00:06:29,814
We have a link to some training resources from about a year ago, in are resilient teaching Canvas site and will include that in the follow up.

40
00:06:29,814 --> 00:06:50,814
But this image below shows the six principles of a trauma informed approach, and they are listed as safety trustworthiness and transparency, peer support, collaboration, and mutuality empowerment, giving voice and choice and cultural, historical and gender

41
00:06:50,814 --> 00:06:52,814
issues.

42
00:06:52,814 --> 00:07:09,814
And when yellow day is set up to be a student driven community, it really opens up, it has the potential to hit on many of these. Some of the ones that stick out, in particular, right away, are that empowerment, peer support and collaboration.

43
00:07:09,814 --> 00:07:13,814
And with that, I'm going to hand this next section over to Monica.

44
00:07:13,814 --> 00:07:16,814
Thanks Joanna.

45
00:07:16,814 --> 00:07:23,814
So as john was mentioning, why should we use yellow dig versus a traditional discussion board.

46
00:07:23,814 --> 00:07:36,814
Well this is an example a diagram that kind of shows you what the standard relationship between the instructor and the students are and how they engage with a topic in a discussion board over several weeks.

47
00:07:36,814 --> 00:07:47,814
So what you will not normally see is this is only showing about five weeks but typically discussion board posts are generated by the instructor, as you can see with the instructor being in the front.

48
00:07:47,814 --> 00:08:02,814
And there's normally a different topic, each week. And so we follow this very staircase type of behavior in which the instruct or post a topic or a question and then your go getter kind of student is the first one to jump in and make a reply.

49
00:08:02,814 --> 00:08:15,814
And then as some time elapsed is getting closer to the end of the week then you start to get a bunch of students who start to reply back. This leaves the crescent eating student at the end and not much time to get as much interaction with the students.

50
00:08:15,814 --> 00:08:30,814
And this tends to be what happens all throughout the weeks, but the students, as time goes on will notice that go getter kind of students starts to lag behind, and we actually get more of the, the interactions with the discussion board, being very close

51
00:08:30,814 --> 00:08:45,814
to the very end of the week when that Cinderella deadline of 1159 and Sunday night, being when most of the discussion posts come in, which doesn't allow a lot of discussion natural conversation regarding the topic to to come up.

52
00:08:45,814 --> 00:08:59,814
Instead what yellow date behavior with students and instructors looks like it's something like this. So basically you haven't first week maybe the instructor sets the standard for how you engage you'll put a question out there share an article or, or

53
00:08:59,814 --> 00:09:06,814
whatnot. And you have lots of students who might be engaging with it. You got your go get her up there but we got a couple of other students who might be engaging with it.

54
00:09:06,814 --> 00:09:19,814
And because of the conversations of the students, this might trickle out into different types of topics, all throughout the week. So instead of having this very staircase one one week one topic, you start to get these conversations that kind of come out

55
00:09:19,814 --> 00:09:33,814
of, you know, out of the first conversation so then maybe students are normally the starters of the next conversation. And so this is a, this models more natural types of conversations among people, so that you know one conversation might lead to a whole

56
00:09:33,814 --> 00:09:39,814
new topic, or maybe two topics have popped up and they kind of converge over time.

57
00:09:39,814 --> 00:09:47,814
But this allow there to be a lot more spread of conversation over time to.

58
00:09:47,814 --> 00:10:01,814
So with that being said it's a little bit easier to understand this when we can kind of see yellow dig in action. So we're going to do is we're going to share the link to the Canvas site, so that you can kind of jump in and see what it looks like to demo

59
00:10:01,814 --> 00:10:04,814
the yellow day community.

60
00:10:04,814 --> 00:10:08,814
Joanna is going to share this with you guys as well.

61
00:10:08,814 --> 00:10:23,814
Yeah, thanks so when you click on this link you'll come, you should be directed straight to this assignment we have, which is within the resilient teaching Canvas site at the bottom is a button that says load yellow the community in a new window.

62
00:10:23,814 --> 00:10:31,814
If this is the first time you're using yellow dig. You will be prompted to fill in some account information such as a password.

63
00:10:31,814 --> 00:10:43,814
If you have you sit before and don't remember your password, you may want to use the Forgot Password or try a couple of your tried and true passwords to see you can get in.

64
00:10:43,814 --> 00:10:55,814
But we want to do is get you into the community that looks like Monica screen now

65
00:10:55,814 --> 00:11:11,814
give you a few minutes to get through that, I'm going to talk through some of the features and we just encourage you to click around while I'm doing that, feel free to play and test it out and read.

66
00:11:11,814 --> 00:11:15,814
Scroll through some of the items that are in there already.

67
00:11:15,814 --> 00:11:31,814
One of the first things I'll touch on is creating your yellow Digg profile in the very less bottom left corner is the ability to fill out your profile, Monica has her own image, down in the lower left corner.

68
00:11:31,814 --> 00:11:41,814
And she can upload a photo she's uploaded a photo but you can fill these things out things that kind of create a little bit more community

69
00:11:41,814 --> 00:11:59,814
here in the profile I believe it's under the settings over in the left hand panel where you could modify your username sort of what's your app name, similar to like a Twitter handle.

70
00:11:59,814 --> 00:12:04,814
And then if you want to return to the community.

71
00:12:04,814 --> 00:12:16,814
You can do so from the home, or the little people icon below that will pop out. There's a couple different ways to navigate to communities, you're a part of.

72
00:12:16,814 --> 00:12:28,814
And so the center area here this main content panel is this single scrolling feed, where you'll see all of the existing posts and comments on posts.

73
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:35,814
So we've used this in a few different training sessions we're kind of hosting it like a practice site.

74
00:12:35,814 --> 00:12:52,814
And so you'll see some activity has taken place in here at the top, the very first post has actually been pinned so that it's always at the top. It provides a little bit of an introduction, some ideas for how you could use yellow dig and a link to a video

75
00:12:52,814 --> 00:13:10,814
on promoting on how to promote discussion on yellow dig the right hand panel to the right hand side of the community is going to give you the Big Blue Create button to add a new post.

76
00:13:10,814 --> 00:13:13,814
And so what it's going to do I can title my post.

77
00:13:13,814 --> 00:13:16,814
I can type content in it.

78
00:13:16,814 --> 00:13:23,814
You'll notice as Monica does it actually begins typing in the message area.

79
00:13:23,814 --> 00:13:40,814
It's going to start keeping track of how many words she's typed, and it will let her know when she's reached the word minimum, and this was all set up as part of the community setup which will cover, but it will let her know when she's reached that goal.

80
00:13:40,814 --> 00:13:54,814
And so she'll be able to earn points for her contribution on this post in the text area you can use at messaging hashtags similar to social networks such as Twitter.

81
00:13:54,814 --> 00:14:02,814
But I can also add items like a poll question as part of my post. I can attach a file. A link.

82
00:14:02,814 --> 00:14:15,814
A video embed an image. I can record an audio and video clip from my computer.

83
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:29,814
Because Monica is a facilitator in this community. She has the ability to pin this post to the top students won't have this option but it will be an option for you if you want to pin something to the top to make sure everyone is the first thing they see

84
00:14:29,814 --> 00:14:32,814
when they come in.

85
00:14:32,814 --> 00:14:49,814
attaching a topic to a post these would be topics that you can set up in advance that match topics you're discussing throughout the semester, and so students can kind of attach a topic, which is going to help organize these when you're filtering or trying

86
00:14:49,814 --> 00:14:52,814
to locate a post.

87
00:14:52,814 --> 00:14:55,814
And you can add emoji icons.

88
00:14:55,814 --> 00:15:13,814
There's a Draw tool so either whiteboard style or uploading an image to annotate on record video like I mentioned, and then adding a formula, this has a lead tech editor for including equations.

89
00:15:13,814 --> 00:15:29,814
And so, as she writes this will save in a draft area, in case she decides No, I am not ready to post this I want to make some changes before I post it or she can hit go on this, and click Post.

90
00:15:29,814 --> 00:15:39,814
And I have a lot of the same features like attached file video record. When I make a comment as well.

91
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:51,814
Nice, go ahead and post that and we should see Monica's points jump in the right hand column, it was sort of in the 845 and she earned some points for doing that.

92
00:15:51,814 --> 00:16:00,814
This community is set up we'll talk about how to set up points but it's a free form meeting a long term goal.

93
00:16:00,814 --> 00:16:03,814
That's what this community is set up.

94
00:16:03,814 --> 00:16:23,814
Below that we can see some of the trending topics and trending hashtags that you can sort of click on to jump to that will sort of sort the scrolling feed for you, and higher up below the Create button are additional filters and sorting options you can

95
00:16:23,814 --> 00:16:37,814
take to get pretty granular, you know, maybe you're looking for a post I know this one student posted something you can actually filter by that individuals name and things like that to locate banks.

96
00:16:37,814 --> 00:16:40,814
So feel free to create a post.

97
00:16:40,814 --> 00:16:49,814
If you made it in. If you're having trouble making it in and you want to get in and give us a shout in the chat.

98
00:16:49,814 --> 00:16:57,814
So notice at the bottom of her post on the right is a comment button, which will allow me to respond.

99
00:16:57,814 --> 00:17:10,814
But I also on the left I have some other few buttons where I can just leave an emoji response such as a thumbs up.

100
00:17:10,814 --> 00:17:23,814
Does that say managed accolade so again, as I have my screen kind of small be again as a facilitator, Monica has the ability to give accolades which are these rewards.

101
00:17:23,814 --> 00:17:42,814
And you can see these different topics and there are actually a points like almost bonus points attached to these, so you can sort of help students see what items you sort of approve of almost, you know, an early bird a thoughtful response, where you

102
00:17:42,814 --> 00:17:56,814
can kind of award what's the an ideal post or an ideal type of response somebody who's maybe followed all the parameters that were outlined, and correct me if I'm wrong but you can ask.

103
00:17:56,814 --> 00:18:09,814
So make these yourself right you can create your own accolades. That's absolutely right and so these are some of the newest default accolades, but you can come in and modify those to match.

104
00:18:09,814 --> 00:18:14,814
You know something related to your course content, and then adjust any point values how you'd like.

105
00:18:14,814 --> 00:18:23,814
That's one nice thing about yellow dig is it's highly customizable and we're going to hit on some other customizable things.

106
00:18:23,814 --> 00:18:27,814
Anything else I needed to hit on here Monica that.

107
00:18:27,814 --> 00:18:29,814
I don't think so.

108
00:18:29,814 --> 00:18:44,814
Maybe the data and activity or something data has an instructor yellow duck has an immense amount of reports and data that are going to show you how students are doing in your community.

109
00:18:44,814 --> 00:18:58,814
There's community health. There's, which some of these are just at a glance, you're going to be able to see how everyone is ranking and points. So you know who's participating and who's not.

110
00:18:58,814 --> 00:19:17,814
They have some built in these health check will live sort of evaluate your community and the amount of activity and interaction that's going on as compared to other university of michigan yellow brick communities, or all yellow dig users across the world.

111
00:19:17,814 --> 00:19:32,814
And then I don't know what this would look like for this course since it's an ongoing one but the network graph is really a favorite of ours, because this is going to give you a really good visual of how students are interacting who's interacting with

112
00:19:32,814 --> 00:19:55,814
who is everyone just talking to me the instructor or Monica my facilitator do all lines go to one of us or our students actually interacting with each other and those lines are sort of outgoing messages comments and incoming who's responding to me.

113
00:19:55,814 --> 00:20:03,814
And so we want is we want a lot of those cross connections so that we know students are interacting with one another.

114
00:20:03,814 --> 00:20:12,814
So if you go back to the main community and do a refresh you can see if we have any.

115
00:20:12,814 --> 00:20:18,814
Yeah, good we've got some tests post. Excellent. So we want to see.

116
00:20:18,814 --> 00:20:34,814
So you can go into that anytime and play around test something out, you know, see what a poll question looks like or respond to one of the poll questions that are in there.

117
00:20:34,814 --> 00:20:42,814
So this would be one that had a post that I posted a while back, it has a, if you want to vote on it, you can always put up something and then have students reflect on that.

118
00:20:42,814 --> 00:20:53,814
Those are always really nice as well.

119
00:20:53,814 --> 00:21:11,814
While we're here Did anybody have any questions or have anything that they'd like us to, you know, click in and kind of explore while we're here.

120
00:21:11,814 --> 00:21:27,814
Feel free to take, you know bait bookmark this site if you ever want to come in as Joanna said, feel free to do whatever you like this is a sandbox for our team and for you guys, you're more than welcome to play around with him.

121
00:21:27,814 --> 00:21:43,814
Sorry, I might have missed this, but on the post when it when it has a resilient teaching versus community, what's the difference in the categories.

122
00:21:43,814 --> 00:22:01,814
Oh, so that would be. Those are basically topic tags so maybe there's something that is specifically references, resilient teaching as a concept or practice, as opposed to you know we did kind of name our Canvas site resilient teaching Canvas site.

123
00:22:01,814 --> 00:22:14,814
And it's sort of automatically named the resilient teaching community yellow big community. Community info is more about how to interact in this space, so.

124
00:22:14,814 --> 00:22:16,814
Okay, thank you.

125
00:22:16,814 --> 00:22:28,814
Right. And as she was mentioning if you were if you were in different courses that were using yellow dig you might have various communities so you would come to your community site, we have a couple of them that were each in, and you can navigate between

126
00:22:28,814 --> 00:22:37,814
your different courses or your different applications of the yellow that community. So for mine You can see that I have a couple of different communities here.

127
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:46,814
When I'm in right now that we're discussing as a result and teaching one.

128
00:22:46,814 --> 00:22:52,814
Oh, right. So, if we jump back to the slides.

129
00:22:52,814 --> 00:22:57,814
We can talk about some best practices and sort of how to get started.

130
00:22:57,814 --> 00:23:01,814
And so,

131
00:23:01,814 --> 00:23:11,814
so I think I touched on this but yellow does not need to be tied to a Canvas site, particularly if you're using it for some sort of CO curricular purpose.

132
00:23:11,814 --> 00:23:21,814
But anyone considering using this as a class discussion and engagement tool you'll want to do this canvas piece.

133
00:23:21,814 --> 00:23:32,814
So I filed this under best practices, and because one of the best practices is actually getting set up properly from the start. so I'll cover these briefly, but in Canvas.

134
00:23:32,814 --> 00:23:40,814
So I'll cover these, briefly, but I do have a handout that goes through in more detail of these

135
00:23:40,814 --> 00:23:51,814
in Canvas you'll want to create a graded assignment, and you'll want to set it to an external tool in the submission type area.

136
00:23:51,814 --> 00:24:08,814
Similar with any other assignments you would provide a point value, and a description, and one thing I'll note here is that the yellow dig all interaction that happens on yellow dig is one single grade for your Canvas site.

137
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:25,814
And so when I work with someone to set this up, I usually titled the assignments, yellow big participation, or course participation or course discussions, and then use that assignment description area to really outline your participation expectations

138
00:24:25,814 --> 00:24:33,814
that you have for students and how you'll be using the tool for the semester.

139
00:24:33,814 --> 00:24:47,814
Next number two here, the instructions in the handout I provider then going to take you over to your canvas grade book and it's suggested to hide this great column from students, until the end of the semester.

140
00:24:47,814 --> 00:25:03,814
When you're ready to release all of your final grades, and this is because for anyone using the weekly point system, students would see this great in Canvas actually reset to zero on a weekly basis and we don't want to send anyone into a panic.

141
00:25:03,814 --> 00:25:07,814
What happens is

142
00:25:07,814 --> 00:25:20,814
that grades sort of resets on weekly but the yellow The site is keeping track of the long term progress. And then, students can always see their actual progress in the yellow dig site.

143
00:25:20,814 --> 00:25:26,814
And then all of that great information will be passed back at the end of the semester.

144
00:25:26,814 --> 00:25:36,814
So secondly, after the yellow dig site, sorry the Canvas site has been set up, you're ready to configure the yellow did community.

145
00:25:36,814 --> 00:25:45,814
There's an initial setup wizard that you can click through that has some helpful for steps, such as start setting the start and end dates of your course.

146
00:25:45,814 --> 00:25:50,814
In this step, yellow big is also applying a weekly point goal.

147
00:25:50,814 --> 00:25:54,814
At that time, but we can make changes to that afterwards.

148
00:25:54,814 --> 00:26:06,814
It's also going to go ahead and prompt you to go ahead and set up some topics that are relevant to your course that students can attach to their posts for that easier searching and filtering.

149
00:26:06,814 --> 00:26:16,814
So, number two, I'm thinking about that point system, you want to think about how to utilize this based on your goals for student participation.

150
00:26:16,814 --> 00:26:30,814
And I definitely want to offer our team to be able to help you think through this, some of the items once you get into the course, and maybe start getting feedback you may be tempted to make some changes and some of those are possible with no problem.

151
00:26:30,814 --> 00:26:41,814
Some of them get a little trickier. Once students have started earning points. So we would love to meet with you and help you get set up on the right foot from the start.

152
00:26:41,814 --> 00:26:44,814
If you're interested in discussing that.

153
00:26:44,814 --> 00:26:58,814
So basically what you're thinking about and what I would be asking you if we were meeting is do you want students participating on a weekly basis, where the weekly point system makes sense, and we can go in and talk about what adjustments you might want

154
00:26:58,814 --> 00:26:59,814
to make to that.

155
00:26:59,814 --> 00:27:12,814
Or do you have more limited expectations where students may not need to post on such a regular schedule where maybe the free form point setting a goal for the semester is a better option.

156
00:27:12,814 --> 00:27:19,814
And then there's also no points, which may be a use case for some of the CO curricular uses.

157
00:27:19,814 --> 00:27:32,814
But I will note that even in those types of instances you might find that point incentive will help drive participation in the community,

158
00:27:32,814 --> 00:27:39,814
yellow tape has pre some preset point options that you can utilize and then modify from there.

159
00:27:39,814 --> 00:27:43,814
So let's look at an example.

160
00:27:43,814 --> 00:27:53,814
This is a screenshot, taken from one of my practice sites is set up as a 15 week course with a weekly point goal.

161
00:27:53,814 --> 00:28:07,814
And so starting at the top of this screenshot where it says, points. Target per period, it's set to 1000 points which means 1000 points per week.

162
00:28:07,814 --> 00:28:13,814
And this sounds like a lot when we're thinking about it in terms of our canvas gradebook scores.

163
00:28:13,814 --> 00:28:20,814
But just remember this will all be translated back using a formula to sort of fit within your gradebook point scale.

164
00:28:20,814 --> 00:28:26,814
Yellow Dog actually provide the exact formulas on their website. If you're interested.

165
00:28:26,814 --> 00:28:46,814
Below that there's called a periodic buffer, and it's noted that time flexibility, so that I can set a range of points that students can earn over that thousand students can sort of pre earn points to make up for something like spring break week where

166
00:28:46,814 --> 00:29:02,814
they're gone. They're not logging into yellow dig, but they can sort of make up for those points, because he doesn't have a way to sort of say, Oh, this is a week off, don't penalize students for not participating.

167
00:29:02,814 --> 00:29:13,814
So, the item below that the points target is 15,000, because if it's set up for 1000 points per week, over 15 weeks.

168
00:29:13,814 --> 00:29:15,814
It's 15,000.

169
00:29:15,814 --> 00:29:30,814
The earning rules is really important. And what will focus on this points per post. So if I create a new post, as indicated here I'll be able to earn 280 points.

170
00:29:30,814 --> 00:29:38,814
If I meet the word requirement, which is down below, and the post word minimum is 40.

171
00:29:38,814 --> 00:29:54,814
Going back up I'll see I can earn 210 points, almost as much by commenting on someone else's post, but I have a lower word minimum there. I have a 20 word minimum to earn those points.

172
00:29:54,814 --> 00:30:06,814
Next are called social points. This is where I earn points. As a student, if somebody comments on my posts, or leaves an emoji reaction on something I posted.

173
00:30:06,814 --> 00:30:13,814
It's like a reward for posting something that others found interesting and wanted to engage with.

174
00:30:13,814 --> 00:30:28,814
And so all of these parameters are things you can go in and adjust. And again, you just want to evaluate what your purpose is what your goals are for student interaction and set it up that way.

175
00:30:28,814 --> 00:30:42,814
This is a look at what yellow did cause the standard point preset they have some others called casual and intensive, and there's actually a drop down menu right above this.

176
00:30:42,814 --> 00:31:01,814
Where does this report this sort of summary is located in yellow dig, where you can kind of see and compare the requirements, and then you can customize and edit any of those to make small adjustments.

177
00:31:01,814 --> 00:31:04,814
See,

178
00:31:04,814 --> 00:31:20,814
so I noted that yellow dig interactions, as a whole, count is one grade in Canvas and how that grade is getting calculated is the weekly point goal contributes to the total goal.

179
00:31:20,814 --> 00:31:33,814
And then that all gets crunched through a formula to give you what in my example I set up as a canvas participation grade. So if we look at an example.

180
00:31:33,814 --> 00:31:50,814
I had mine set up for 1000 points per week for 15 weeks, week by week that contributes toward that 15,000 point goal. And then that formula is going to make that fit into what I set up in Canvas which is 100 points.

181
00:31:50,814 --> 00:32:04,814
Or I could even wait it to be a certain percentage of the final grade in my example it's participation is 10% of the final grade.

182
00:32:04,814 --> 00:32:09,814
And with that, I'm going to pass it back to Monica.

183
00:32:09,814 --> 00:32:21,814
Thanks. So picking up for Joanne I left off. One of the things that will also want to keep in mind is how to actually interact with the platform so we'll talk about a few do's and don'ts.

184
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:36,814
First I want to start off with a few things to try to avoid, and that is for one try to if you can break the mindset of that yellow dig into discussion board, my, you know discussion board and that is one posts that the instructor creates and the students

185
00:32:36,814 --> 00:32:49,814
are supposed to be responding to that question prompt. Instead, we want to make sure that we kind of think of this more like a community and so we're trying to get everybody to participate and everybody engaging with it, and everybody being the initiator

186
00:32:49,814 --> 00:33:04,814
of upcoming conversations. The other thing you want to try and do is try to avoid the written assignment prompt type so in a traditional discussion board, what ends up happening happening is it's not so much of a natural conversation because the prompts

187
00:33:04,814 --> 00:33:12,814
that often get put up are kind of like these more elaborate written assignments that are just put on a public feed.

188
00:33:12,814 --> 00:33:27,814
That doesn't make it very natural to have a conversation about it's more or less like a written assignment that has a yes or no response, or you know can be graded and the quality of the actual writing, so instead we're trying to have a conversation like

189
00:33:27,814 --> 00:33:32,814
water cooler chat around the topics of the course.

190
00:33:32,814 --> 00:33:49,814
The next thing is the try and you'll want to be helping modify how to interact with the yellow dig in the beginning but for the most part, try to avoid micromanaging the discussion board and the yellow community that is to try to avoid constraining participation

191
00:33:49,814 --> 00:34:04,814
with these very narrow requirements such as again incorrect or correct types of prompts. These kind of lead to students when they engage with other discussion prompts they just say, Yeah, that's a great comment I agree and so we're trying to avoid those

192
00:34:04,814 --> 00:34:07,814
types of responses and in order to do so.

193
00:34:07,814 --> 00:34:20,814
Think about more like open ended types of question prompts or sharing media and news about the content of your course. So again, if you can kind of think I'm going to kind of model the behavior that I want to see from students from the beginning and then

194
00:34:20,814 --> 00:34:31,814
just kind of stepping off a little bit and kind of let the students take over it, and then interact with the platform, the way the students should be interacting with him.

195
00:34:31,814 --> 00:34:49,814
Next, Joanna kind of hinted upon this already, but try to avoid making weekly yellow dig assignments in the canvas profile area that is because yellow did uses a single feed to allow for encouraging and revisiting topics, and the more assignment links

196
00:34:49,814 --> 00:35:05,814
you make back to the yellow dig community, it actually makes more additional grade book columns and this can be super confusing so the best way to approach this is to have just that one item for yellow dig participation, 10%, even if they need to, you

197
00:35:05,814 --> 00:35:19,814
know, they're getting some points for interacting with it, weekly, and we do have some resources about this and we'll share the slides with you afterwards so you can, if you'd like, you can click in here and see some of those resources for how to set

198
00:35:19,814 --> 00:35:20,814
that up.

199
00:35:20,814 --> 00:35:33,814
Now we've kind of discussed what not to do so maybe now we can shift mindset over to what to do and I've kind of hinted at this a little bit already, but the best way to get some engagement from the students is to lead by example.

200
00:35:33,814 --> 00:35:46,814
So, that is complete your profile put in your profile picture, talk about a little bit about yourself, put in the same kinds of information that you'd like students to see because they will click on each other's profiles to learn about each other.

201
00:35:46,814 --> 00:35:52,814
So it's a good idea to complete yours as well. And then also encourage students to complete their profile.

202
00:35:52,814 --> 00:35:59,814
This kind of gives them an idea of taking ownership of their status in the social in that social network platform type of environment.

203
00:35:59,814 --> 00:36:01,814
Be sure to introduce yourself.

204
00:36:01,814 --> 00:36:13,814
You know, I asked the students who didn't introduce themselves as well to the course, and then participate in it. So even though we say don't micromanage the course it is good to step in there kind of see what students are talking about.

205
00:36:13,814 --> 00:36:20,814
You can always add articles that you see that are coming up what's in the news it's relevant to the course of the material.

206
00:36:20,814 --> 00:36:30,814
You can use all the features that yellow duck has so you can upload those discussions that you really like you can like them users and mo Geez, add surveys.

207
00:36:30,814 --> 00:36:37,814
And again, as I mentioned before, feel free to share other media sources that are of course content related.

208
00:36:37,814 --> 00:36:50,814
And then again with that trying to be that guide on the side instead of the sage on the stage guide the discussions in the direction that you want. If you see, you know, good post, feel free to throw those accolades in there that'll encourage students

209
00:36:50,814 --> 00:36:55,814
to, to have an idea as to what is a good post.

210
00:36:55,814 --> 00:37:02,814
So, next and related Lee is the make use the use of all the those features.

211
00:37:02,814 --> 00:37:17,814
The pending the topics and the hashtag, you could use the pending for course announcements to or how regarding the Reddit community, and you can use the topics to organize the conversations by theme so for instance if each week has a major theme you can

212
00:37:17,814 --> 00:37:31,814
organize it that way, and ask the students to use those topics as well. And then you have the hashtags. You can use those hashtags for a variety of different ways, but I find that they're most you supposed to start to use by searching by buzzwords or

213
00:37:31,814 --> 00:37:37,814
that maybe some of the jargon and technical terms that they're learning so they're using them effectively and then you can search through the conversation.

214
00:37:37,814 --> 00:37:40,814
Using those.

215
00:37:40,814 --> 00:37:49,814
And then lastly, as mentioned before, try to avoid the, the discussion board mindset and adopt the community building mindset.

216
00:37:49,814 --> 00:37:57,814
Give the platform back to the students so you may be helping with it and the beginning, but then allow them to kind of take it in the direction that they like.

217
00:37:57,814 --> 00:38:08,814
And then again, as we've mentioned before, think of yellow Digg as an academic or professional professional social network platform, there should be a little bit more of a relaxed form of conversation.

218
00:38:08,814 --> 00:38:19,814
It should still be clean and nice and right, and there are the there is the option we didn't go over it, but you know students can kind of monitor each other as there is the option to flag inappropriate posts, if that would have happened we hadn't seen

219
00:38:19,814 --> 00:38:27,814
anything like that happened before. Students are normally pretty good on there but that is there for them.

220
00:38:27,814 --> 00:38:34,814
So with that being said we're going to talk about a few of the experiences that some of the faculty have had here.

221
00:38:34,814 --> 00:38:40,814
And the first one I want to introduce is Kevin.

222
00:38:40,814 --> 00:38:50,814
He has been using this case so go ahead Kevin and I will give you remote access so you should be able to click through using the keyboard to move my slides along.

223
00:38:50,814 --> 00:39:06,814
Okay, great. Well, good afternoon everybody and I shared with Monica and Joanne a couple of slides just to sort of guide some discussion, spend just a couple minutes on this but I'm just like many of you all.

224
00:39:06,814 --> 00:39:16,814
I mean I had never used yellow big before this semester so it's not like I'm some, you know, yellow dig plant or some expert only before August that never even touched.

225
00:39:16,814 --> 00:39:31,814
Okay, so I just wanted to sort of reinforce some of the things that we just heard from both Monique and Joanna and then just kind of give you a little bit of my own personal experience so this is with respect to an in person course.

226
00:39:31,814 --> 00:39:34,814
Population Health Informatics.

227
00:39:34,814 --> 00:39:42,814
And the way I got started was very much along the lines of what has been recommended here which is, first of all, like I said I didn't know anything about yellow day.

228
00:39:42,814 --> 00:39:52,814
And so I went right to the videos and watch them there's several of them they're very helpful extremely helpful that very very well done.

229
00:39:52,814 --> 00:39:55,814
And right off the bat.

230
00:39:55,814 --> 00:40:07,814
I got my cheat sheet, which was extremely helpful like that's like all caps you know underscore extremely helpful, because I didn't know what I was doing.

231
00:40:07,814 --> 00:40:11,814
And I just thought this is important, and it was important to do it right.

232
00:40:11,814 --> 00:40:20,814
And so that sort of went to the next point which is the lead by example I thought yeah this is really something. You can't just.

233
00:40:20,814 --> 00:40:32,814
You can't just sort of tell folks this is what you expect without doing it yourself and I thought well the easiest way to get get things rolling is to in fact do it myself and get things rolling.

234
00:40:32,814 --> 00:40:48,814
So I started with a welcome video, you know, a three minute video, which was posted the week before class started, and it was introduction to not only myself but then to yellow jet because I assumed many students had not used it themselves.

235
00:40:48,814 --> 00:41:01,814
So I gave him sort of the quick background actually using some of the very very high level talking points from the cheat sheet, and just hope to start a little momentum there.

236
00:41:01,814 --> 00:41:05,814
And I went with.

237
00:41:05,814 --> 00:41:16,814
I was very cognizant of the fact that this is not a discussion board and I think that that distinction is extremely important because you know exactly what happens with the attic.

238
00:41:16,814 --> 00:41:28,814
That Monica shared. And so I thought yeah we just got to get these students really engaged. And so I asked that first week with some open ended questions about not only introducing themselves.

239
00:41:28,814 --> 00:41:42,814
Then also, I posted some sort of thought provoking or with the intent of being thought provoking questions really with respect to the, the covert pandemic.

240
00:41:42,814 --> 00:41:55,814
because, you know, there is almost every aspect of code that relates to population health informatics so this is a real easy one to get students engaged and everybody.

241
00:41:55,814 --> 00:42:12,814
If they don't have to be epidemiology students to be engaged with coven right we're all experiencing it. So I asked them to use that as sort of a first dive into this and it got immediate traction now I will say for the first couple of weeks.

242
00:42:12,814 --> 00:42:26,814
Students tended to have sort of, you know, sort of light, type of chit chat i mean you know a bunch of students got something going that was having to do with what your favorite Pat was and stuff and I decided Don't let this kind of let this go.

243
00:42:26,814 --> 00:42:34,814
You know, I actually throughout the course so far I actually have not stepped in and said hey let's get back on up. Never I decided I was never going to do that.

244
00:42:34,814 --> 00:42:48,814
And it was never necessary. So students really sort of took off with this, I should say though that just as a backdrop, and I basically went with the default pretty much with the points I think it may have been Joanna talking about the point structure.

245
00:42:48,814 --> 00:43:00,814
I don't think I fiddled with that at all I sort of read through it, agreed with the philosophy and just said, Okay, I'm going to go with it so I think I'm 1000 points a week for 14 weeks or whatever it was and I sort of moved the default.

246
00:43:00,814 --> 00:43:14,814
And I set up my course so that this is 10% of their grade I have a 20% participation so this yellow dig is half of their participation. The in class participation is the other half and so it's a big deal.

247
00:43:14,814 --> 00:43:20,814
So I set the expectations, and students are really stepped right up to it.

248
00:43:20,814 --> 00:43:29,814
So, I'll see if I can advance my slide here, Monica.

249
00:43:29,814 --> 00:43:36,814
I'm trying to advance. Maybe you can just skip to the next slide, Monica.

250
00:43:36,814 --> 00:43:50,814
Okay, thank you. Um, so, just as an example of some of the topics that was already discussed briefly, you know, again this is population health informatics I just caught, called out some of the topics that I use just to give you a sort of an image, because

251
00:43:50,814 --> 00:43:51,814
again in.

252
00:43:51,814 --> 00:44:04,814
You know so much relates to coven 19 and population health informatics but it's obviously much broader than that we talked about big data and a big part of our course has to do with linking data sources and sort of getting leveraging other sources and

253
00:44:04,814 --> 00:44:21,814
interoperability with electronic health records, and the like. And so that was a very helpful way of anchoring the discussions and it continues even today I mean I've had many many discussions actually I just checked right before this, this session started

254
00:44:21,814 --> 00:44:34,814
somebody posted a really interesting one on big data using zip code level data for vaccine hesitancy both with overhead and other vaccines digital health care amongst low income populations.

255
00:44:34,814 --> 00:44:46,814
Big Data opportunities geographic information systems, this is just in the past like two days dv I mean, this is really something that the students are engaging with.

256
00:44:46,814 --> 00:45:03,814
And I would say that my goal also my secret goal, stated only to myself was, I do not want to be the yellow big leader, right, it's sort of I want to be somewhere near the bottom I want students to leave this is their platform I want them to discuss.

257
00:45:03,814 --> 00:45:18,814
I'm very happy to tell you that, that seems to be the case. Okay, if you can just. Next slide. So my last slide. So, I'm, they're using it, and this is a, this came right from the data

258
00:45:18,814 --> 00:45:32,814
view that, I think, Joanna told us about I've grayed out my students names, but this is from last week and you'll see that the top student there she had 13,000 points last week but she's already crossed over 14,000 so he's already gotten her.

259
00:45:32,814 --> 00:45:45,814
Her semesters worth of point, but that's not going to stop her because she's super engaged and so are the other students, and you'll see, if you look at me down there at the bottom, I'm at the bottom guy but I'm real close to the bottom and that's pretty

260
00:45:45,814 --> 00:45:55,814
much where I want to be I just want to chime in as some thoughtful questions comment on students give them the thumbs up and you know accolades and so forth.

261
00:45:55,814 --> 00:46:07,814
And every now and again I'll drop a strategic post to sort of echo what we just talked about in class, that sort of thing. And so, I can't tell you.

262
00:46:07,814 --> 00:46:11,814
I was very confident that this was going to work but it worked.

263
00:46:11,814 --> 00:46:26,814
It worked and I would strongly advise following more or less. The that tutorial and the, the guidelines that were posted because it's, it's not hard. Okay, so I've had to do extremely limited nudging.

264
00:46:26,814 --> 00:46:40,814
The first couple of weeks, I did look at some students who were not participating and just sort of the little strategic offline nudge to remind them that seemed to kind of get things a little bit more engaged.

265
00:46:40,814 --> 00:46:53,814
I think some students inherently have some reservations I have, you know, some international students that maybe not as comfortable, those sorts of things so try to you know work with them on that but basically trying to keep the conversation starters

266
00:46:53,814 --> 00:46:59,814
going and it's, it's worked really, really well so I'll stop there.

267
00:46:59,814 --> 00:47:04,814
Fantastic. Thank you so much for sharing about this.

268
00:47:04,814 --> 00:47:15,814
If anyone has any questions for Kevin please feel free to add them to the chat. We are going to move on to Amy,

269
00:47:15,814 --> 00:47:22,814
who falls into the let's get creative creative problem solving category so I'll hand it over to her.

270
00:47:22,814 --> 00:47:33,814
Great, thank you. Good afternoon. So my name is Amy sir Janice I'm actually a program manager and the Office of Global Public Health which is housed in the dean's office at Michigan Public Health.

271
00:47:33,814 --> 00:47:50,814
So I was asked today to talk a bit about the need that we had and how we use yellow tape to meet that need. So, one of the activities of our offices providing competitive funding for students to do eight week international internships, and when the pandemic

272
00:47:50,814 --> 00:48:04,814
health, you know, students had the option, they were not required to do internships, but many students still wanted that experience, and they wanted to work with international organizations so we were able to, you know, help them come up with a way to

273
00:48:04,814 --> 00:48:10,814
be funded to do remote international internships working with

274
00:48:10,814 --> 00:48:25,814
partners out you know out of the country. And so we did have about 20 students and one of our requirements, you know they have to do a report in the fall on their experience but they also have to participate in our traditional poster session which is

275
00:48:25,814 --> 00:48:36,814
usually in the winter term out, you know, following that summer internship, and to basically showcase the project they worked on during their internships.

276
00:48:36,814 --> 00:48:53,814
So, in the fall, you know, given the uncertainty of how things were happening and whether we would be able to bring students and faculty together for this in person poster session started researching, you know, how can we do this remotely, and looked

277
00:48:53,814 --> 00:48:55,814
at a lot of options.

278
00:48:55,814 --> 00:49:05,814
You know, simple as you know, can we do have a zoom session, they can do one minute lightning talks and then have breakout rooms where people can then engage with those students.

279
00:49:05,814 --> 00:49:19,814
So those were some of the things we looked at fortunately the epidemiology department under the direction of Professor l August had held an internship session and I you know I know the school was looking at that time.

280
00:49:19,814 --> 00:49:36,814
At yellow did as an option for something that they need purchase a license on and they let that department pilot for a poster session so it had kind of already been done, and we were still two months out so we started talking a bit more with Professor

281
00:49:36,814 --> 00:49:54,814
August, and talking with yellow dig about how you know, what are the capabilities and how can we do this. And so after, you know, learning about the good experiences and kind of the options for yellow did we, we went forward with deciding to do the poster

282
00:49:54,814 --> 00:50:10,814
session so here on this first slide just kind of showing the options of what we did to make this poster session successful so the students, you know posted a bio a video and abstract and their poster about you know their internship experience.

283
00:50:10,814 --> 00:50:16,814
We opened up yellow dig for all the visitors, about a week before the actual.

284
00:50:16,814 --> 00:50:35,814
We called it in real time engagement on zoom. And so, students each had a one hour time where they would get engaged face to face on zoom but before that they were required to respond to questions from visitors to their yellow duck posts.

285
00:50:35,814 --> 00:50:44,814
So see if I can change the slide here. Could you change the slide Monica.

286
00:50:44,814 --> 00:50:57,814
So this first example here is a screenshot from Yellow Dog from one of our two poster winners so and just to point out, you know we have permission to share the work of these two students.

287
00:50:57,814 --> 00:51:15,814
So this example kind of gives you an idea of how posts were required to be set up, and how students take their posts, and also kind of show how the q amp a is integrated in at the bottom there so at the top students all had their name.

288
00:51:15,814 --> 00:51:25,814
They had the title of their project which all of these things are searchable so if someone was looking for a specific student they could easily do that with the search function.

289
00:51:25,814 --> 00:51:33,814
And then as you can see there there are different color tags and so we encourage students to use these again to make searching easy.

290
00:51:33,814 --> 00:51:46,814
So they did by department, they did by the country of the organization where they worked, or the population was based for the project that they worked on, and also by topical area.

291
00:51:46,814 --> 00:51:58,814
So again, this helps so if you know someone who's interested only in sort of the environmental health projects, they could easily find those through the search function.

292
00:51:58,814 --> 00:52:00,814
We did.

293
00:52:00,814 --> 00:52:12,814
In order to easily have participants link off to the zoom sessions that were offered kind of on that Friday of the week of the event.

294
00:52:12,814 --> 00:52:21,814
They could easily click off from zoom and get into this the the zoom session for each of the students.

295
00:52:21,814 --> 00:52:36,814
Let's see. We also asked each student to create a one minute video to kind of entice the audience to want to view their posters and more detail. We found, you know, during the in person poster sessions that students really had a hard time kind of giving

296
00:52:36,814 --> 00:52:47,814
that one minute pitch, and this was actually really great practice for them to record the record and get that kind of one minute pitch down.

297
00:52:47,814 --> 00:53:05,814
And we also asked them to provide an abstract, and a poster in a PDF or PDF format and a JPEG format so what you see at the top there is the, the PDF format and then below that I'm sorry the JPEG format and below that is a PDF so participants could then

298
00:53:05,814 --> 00:53:15,814
click on those and enlarge them on their computers are saved them to their computer whatever works well for them to be able to feed it the posters.

299
00:53:15,814 --> 00:53:19,814
If you can go into the next slide please.

300
00:53:19,814 --> 00:53:38,814
So this third slide the item on the left is a depiction of the pin date and we have us our Associate Director providing kind of an overview and making the donors for the internship funding and just talking a little bit about our office and how to access

301
00:53:38,814 --> 00:53:43,814
different things on the site so that was pinned to the top.

302
00:53:43,814 --> 00:53:48,814
I think actually you might have missed one slide ahead I'm sorry.

303
00:53:48,814 --> 00:54:02,814
Oh yeah here we go so the second student example here is Anthony dang and he, he was A People's Choice Award winner, and I provided this example I mean you can see here that he has a very similar format to the first student example.

304
00:54:02,814 --> 00:54:14,814
That was how we asked students to do that but the middle box here, you very at the very top you'll see a professor was asking a question that wasn't addressed by the poster.

305
00:54:14,814 --> 00:54:31,814
And so one of the advantages of yellow dig. You can see here is his student was working on food packaging labeling and, you know, did a comparison of other countries that had requirements and some countries that had just a strong recommendation to use

306
00:54:31,814 --> 00:54:46,814
food labeling and the professor had said you know so we see these results. So, what is the difference in the food labeling so if he was standing at a traditional posterboard it makes it really difficult to

307
00:54:46,814 --> 00:54:59,814
kind of say hey here's what these others look like so. The advantage of yellow Jake is he is able to post these examples from other countries to kind of say hey this is what other places have utilized for this food labeling products.

308
00:54:59,814 --> 00:55:13,814
So, I noticed it in other posts with students they were able to share actual survey questions which they can't get on to a full poster board so I really felt like students had the opportunity to give more thoughtful responses they had the time to do that

309
00:55:13,814 --> 00:55:23,814
they could respond when they had time or look something up, which was which was great with the yellow duck so on to the last second to last slide.

310
00:55:23,814 --> 00:55:37,814
These are some of the advantages that we had with yellow dig so obviously user friendly interface is a very similar format to other social media platforms like Facebook so people kind of understood the concept of scrolling down and then having the q amp

311
00:55:37,814 --> 00:55:43,814
a right below the post for each student.

312
00:55:43,814 --> 00:56:00,814
It's the platform allows video other types of documents PDF jpg, all immersed in one post the question and answer function, it's pretty intuitive and easy to follow the response is kind of indented in so it's really obvious you know with the question

313
00:56:00,814 --> 00:56:03,814
responds, the ones that go together.

314
00:56:03,814 --> 00:56:16,814
There's different in app and email notifications that really keep people engaged so you can say I'd like to you know when someone responds to my posts or shows a reaction to my posts and get an email.

315
00:56:16,814 --> 00:56:30,814
And if someone, someone can ask you a question and you know right away and you can go in whenever you feel like going in to answer that question so you don't have to keep logging into yellow daring to find out kind of what's going on, which I thought

316
00:56:30,814 --> 00:56:32,814
was great.

317
00:56:32,814 --> 00:56:49,814
The tags obviously were very useful in terms of helping people search for things of interest that they wanted to view and a couple other things here. It provided you know opportunity for students to reflect on questions before responding so that's typically

318
00:56:49,814 --> 00:56:57,814
not always possible when they're confronted with a bunch of people standing in front of their poster board so they really were able to give the questions a lot of thought.

319
00:56:57,814 --> 00:57:11,814
It's also easier to share as I mentioned before survey questions or other graphics to kind of fill in those missing pieces that the audience doesn't necessarily know about from your poster and really one of the greatest advantages for us considering we

320
00:57:11,814 --> 00:57:15,814
were looking at, you know, global audiences.

321
00:57:15,814 --> 00:57:26,814
We were able to include people that may be otherwise could not attend you know one hour to our poster session so they could participate in yellow.

322
00:57:26,814 --> 00:57:30,814
So that was great. And so last slide, please.

323
00:57:30,814 --> 00:57:38,814
Were again trying to incorporate yellow did this year so we are wanting to do an in person poster session a traditional poster session.

324
00:57:38,814 --> 00:57:53,814
But because of just all of the advantages we're really hoping to integrate with yellow dig into more of a high reformat map this year so the hybrid formats going to allow us if for some reason we can't meet in person, we were already set up to go fully

325
00:57:53,814 --> 00:57:59,814
remote, and we know this, you know, has been successful.

326
00:57:59,814 --> 00:58:08,814
Having yellow brick is an option, it's going to allow family, friends, international partners to continue to participate in the poster session.

327
00:58:08,814 --> 00:58:21,814
And one of the things that I actually thought was kind of surprising was a lot of the students, they were getting feedback through yellow dig from your faculty and other participants other students were looking at their posters, and they were getting

328
00:58:21,814 --> 00:58:31,814
feedback and so they were actually we didn't know what's going to happen today we're reworking their posters and then reposting so that's kind of an advantage of having an online format so they were improving their poster.

329
00:58:31,814 --> 00:58:42,814
And so we're hoping you know and I wouldn't be surprised that you know they'll get feedback in that week leading up to the in person, and maybe they're going to print a totally different posts or than what you know was actually on yellow dig, and that's

330
00:58:42,814 --> 00:58:45,814
okay they're not not getting graded on that right.

331
00:58:45,814 --> 00:58:49,814
So the other thing.

332
00:58:49,814 --> 00:59:04,814
For me, it was great too because I have everything really organized and available in Yellow Dog and I can easily download that I can use that for marketing purposes or, you know, showing other students in future years about activities that students participated

333
00:59:04,814 --> 00:59:20,814
in. And so yeah definitely overwhelming positive response from both students and our audience about using analytics so we're going to continue to use that so thanks for the opportunity to share, you know, our experience with using yellow happy to answer

334
00:59:20,814 --> 00:59:25,814
any questions or offline you know if anyone wants to contact me happy to talk.

335
00:59:25,814 --> 00:59:38,814
Thank you so much, Amy. We have hit our time. So I do want to give anyone who needs to leave permission, but we did just get Michael in the room and he was going to share a little bit about his experience.

336
00:59:38,814 --> 00:59:57,814
And so I would love to still get that Michael if you have the time, at least for our recording. I'm also going to share a brief survey link in the chat, we'd love some feedback on your thoughts about today's session and about yellow dig.

337
00:59:57,814 --> 01:07:00,174
But other than that, we will hand it over to Michael.

338
01:00:01,814 --> 01:00:06,814
Thanks Joanne on apologies for getting delayed and my attendance.

339
01:00:06,814 --> 01:00:23,814
I think that the most positive aspect about young dig for my students this term has been their ability to share, both class content as well as non class content and create a community where that is possible.

340
01:00:23,814 --> 01:00:37,814
I was just looking this morning at some of the posts that have been coming through. So each of the groups that I have preset in my seminar are named for a different place in Michigan a different park or different sort of natural landmark.

341
01:00:37,814 --> 01:00:53,814
So, I saw that one of the students just posted several pictures from her trip to one of those places and it was this really nice way of kind of blending both a you know a class related topic as well as something that's not the other.

342
01:00:53,814 --> 01:01:07,814
The other piece of yellow dig that I'm looking forward to using the next couple weeks is their final presentations are all going to go on to yellow dig, they'll be recording what they're going to be developing, They're going to post it on yellow dicks

343
01:01:07,814 --> 01:01:19,814
with that way they can all see what they created last year I ended up doing this same process but it was using a Google doc and it was, you know, posting videos and canvas and just, it didn't feel very cohesive.

344
01:01:19,814 --> 01:01:22,814
This will give them a space where they can.

345
01:01:22,814 --> 01:01:32,814
They've been using LG throughout the term, the biggest takeaway or lesson learned that I guess I can share is that I had to make some adjustments to the points.

346
01:01:32,814 --> 01:01:35,814
It's a little bit daunting to have to post four or five times a week.

347
01:01:35,814 --> 01:01:42,814
Thanks to join on instructional services team for helping us to sort that out or helping me to sort that out.

348
01:01:42,814 --> 01:01:57,814
But it seems to be working well and you know they just have a chance to kind of cultivate community and I noticed it in the classroom that in person. they seem to be a little bit more integrated a little bit more collegial because they're keeping in touch,

349
01:01:57,814 --> 01:02:13,814
from week to week. So, all in all it's been very positive. I'll be teaching a large course in the winter, perhaps maybe will be the courageous one to try to use yellow dig for it 200 something person class, but stay tuned I don't know if I will do that.

350
01:02:13,814 --> 01:02:15,814
We'll see. Maybe for discussion sections.

351
01:02:15,814 --> 01:07:00,174
Maybe for discussion sections. Thank you so much for sharing a bit of your experience.

352
01:02:27,814 --> 01:02:30,814
But, on what slide to go to next.

353
01:02:30,814 --> 01:02:42,814
I will say there is another case in here if you guys are interested in watching I won't make you go through the entire one but it was a special case study again using a role playing simulation by Professor sharing Guardium.

354
01:02:42,814 --> 01:02:55,814
If you're interested, again, you're more than welcome to go through the slides and see how she set that up, which was really quite neat. And then we also have a couple of resources that we've attached at the end of these slides that you guys can use as

355
01:02:55,814 --> 01:02:59,814
well.

356
01:02:59,814 --> 01:03:10,814
And we shared a survey link and then we have another training session coming up, called the Canvas course checklist want to thank you all for spending your lunch hour with us.

357
01:03:10,814 --> 01:03:24,814
I am going to go ahead and address the question in the chat, how long does it take to monitor or grade most weeks, do one of our users want to address that

358
01:03:24,814 --> 01:03:37,814
didn't find it took a lot of time but I do have to set aside time I usually do, like on a Monday morning or something set maybe a half hour so I just make sure I can keep up with all the posts, make sure I can react to them, dump into conversation so

359
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:44,814
you know you probably wants to run, running and going, I'd say maybe an hour. That's just a guess.

360
01:03:44,814 --> 01:03:58,814
And I noticed you and Michael both reference to something that happened like today in the discussion, are you kind of in the habit of checking and seeing how things are going or How frequently do you find yourself looking at it or that notifications that

361
01:03:58,814 --> 01:04:13,814
that are prompting you to go in, both for me, both so y'all D will will now notify when somebody commented or whatever and so I do react to those but then I make it a point at least beginning of the week probably end of the week just to touch base with

362
01:04:13,814 --> 01:04:16,814
yellow big and take a look.

363
01:04:16,814 --> 01:04:27,814
Yeah, I've been kind of leaving it to be a little bit more student sort of monitored or student moderated.

364
01:04:27,814 --> 01:04:36,814
And that was only because at the beginning I was taking the same approach, Kevin that you just shared.

365
01:04:36,814 --> 01:04:46,814
And the students. I think seem to want to drive, how much they were posting etc. and I wanted to encourage them to do that.

366
01:04:46,814 --> 01:05:03,814
I will say that the point system is what for me was the most was probably the most tenuous to sort out my, I got, you know, feedback that it felt like busy work you know that they, they weren't necessarily deriving everything they were looking for from

367
01:05:03,814 --> 01:05:18,814
it but I'm not sure that I necessarily would concur that there was just busy work coming out of it I think they didn't realize yet that they were getting something out of that, that there's that community cultivation it's something that you just, you

368
01:05:18,814 --> 01:05:25,814
know, by doing that's how you get it.

369
01:05:25,814 --> 01:05:30,814
Thank you,

370
01:05:30,814 --> 01:05:37,814
all kinds of great things sorry I know I'm just you have me thinking and I'm checking here what was going on this weekend.

371
01:05:37,814 --> 01:05:46,814
And, I mean, they post articles, thoughts, ideas all kinds of things, it's just it's a very dynamic and rich platform.

372
01:05:46,814 --> 01:05:55,814
And how did you sort of set the expectations for what you expected or kind of wanted them to do as they got started.

373
01:05:55,814 --> 01:06:04,814
I created categories, they present a case every week or a group presents a case every week so I asked the case group to present to post their case presentation and yellow dig.

374
01:06:04,814 --> 01:06:17,814
They have a current event that they're assigned at some point throughout the term so each person who does their current event has to post that in so that kind of gives them something class activities breakouts I would have them posted on yellow digs that

375
01:06:17,814 --> 01:06:19,814
would give them something.

376
01:06:19,814 --> 01:06:28,814
And, and then, you know, non, non course related question, or not course related posts are sort of categorized separately.

377
01:06:28,814 --> 01:06:33,814
Thanks, some flexibility. Yeah.

378
01:06:33,814 --> 01:06:34,814
Excellent.

379
01:06:34,814 --> 01:06:37,814
Well, Thank you three for presenting.

380
01:06:37,814 --> 01:07:00,174
Thank you to our attendees.
