1
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:06,250
I'm sure a lot of the things I'm saying.

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:29,370
Yeah, I mean, I give you a lot, but it doesn't mean I wasn't running for office and I wrote, you know, I got to know something about that.

3
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:47,700
And I was like, you know, you want to do this, let's look at the story.

4
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:52,680
You think, oh, it's not this time.

5
00:00:56,130 --> 00:01:03,320
Yeah. Hello? Yeah, I know what I'm doing.

6
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:23,610
I was like, hey, you know, it's like, I think they would be like, Oh, that's what it is.

7
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:36,810
And what can we do to quantify that already if you haven't already?

8
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:43,070
Because it was not what I have been doing out here.

9
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:56,590
I'm thinking that since you've been out of town, you get to work and then after classes, just send it back up here again and won't worry about.

10
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:03,550
I'll write every Thursday over the week.

11
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:14,470
Today we will be issuing the second part of a two part start, which is kind of the state of quality here in the U.S.

12
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:18,550
Health care. A few quick things.

13
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:24,790
The great planning assignment is due today and the day, so I'm excited to be here.

14
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:29,170
1159. So does anyone have any questions on that?

15
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:37,370
Do feel free to email myself and to help you out, but make sure you get those.

16
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:44,860
Turn it back, please. We're also going to be hopefully finalizing the Qualtrics survey for the group projects this week.

17
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:51,430
And so, again, if you have a project team in mind, keep that in mind as you're kind of filling that out.

18
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:56,799
I was about to invite people again, you can do a case analysis improvement project that those that are choosing an empirical

19
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:02,920
project who will contact you and have a time to chat and kind of work through some of those.

20
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:10,420
There also will be office hours and immediately after this you report room.

21
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:19,900
It's not often that we have to public. So we'll be having kind of hours regularly after the Thursday class for about an hour.

22
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:26,350
That's just something that we can have in the books so that if people want to meet or chat about something, we'll be there.

23
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:33,070
I'm also at that time, does it work for people? I know that other people have other classes and whatnot.

24
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:38,960
Let us know. And we can also set up a different type of chat either in person or consume something like this.

25
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:44,130
So you know the romance. Okay, perfect.

26
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:47,650
Thank you. So we'll put it up on the board as it's here in a speech. But I will do it.

27
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:55,050
Yes. The next class on Tuesday, we'll be talking about measuring quality and value and different ways to do that.

28
00:03:55,390 --> 00:04:00,600
So be sure to check canvas for supplies and any kind of readings beforehand.

29
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,470
Any prompting questions. We will start on Tuesday.

30
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:10,220
Any questions or thoughts.

31
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:15,890
Okay. So overview of today's topic.

32
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:22,310
So last Tuesday, we talked about kind of what is good and not so good about the health care system, issues that we're dealing with currently.

33
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:27,559
And today we're going to be focusing on kind of how do we evaluate quality.

34
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,080
I know we kind of talk about things being high quality, low quality,

35
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:34,309
what are kind of some frameworks or ways to think about how we can specifically measure that?

36
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:36,200
And we'll get into it a little more specifically next week,

37
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:41,330
but just kind of thinking broadly about how how can we measure quality within the health care system today?

38
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:49,459
So that will be primarily the topic for today. So these are not written in stone anywhere,

39
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:54,650
but these are kind of six ways or six domains that we can think about measuring quality in health care systems.

40
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:01,640
And we'll kind of go through each of these with some examples and some vignettes about, you know, people that interact with the health care system.

41
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:05,380
So the first we can think of is, you know, patient safety, health system, harm.

42
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:11,030
You know, first, you know, that's kind of one way that we think about health care quality and how we can evaluate that,

43
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:19,700
how well we're providing evidence based care. So whether we're doing the things that we should be doing based off of evidence or minimizing overuse.

44
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:25,880
So that's a topic that has come up here in this class a few times is, you know, are we doing things more than we should be?

45
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,739
Patient experience is one that has gained a lot of traction over the last decade,

46
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:37,790
which is are people satisfied and pleased with the type of care they're getting, the effectiveness of the care that we provide?

47
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:41,540
So, you know, once we do something, how well are we doing it?

48
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:46,999
And then the last is kind of population health. And this is something that's also coming in the conversation,

49
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,000
which is outside of kind of the specifically, you know, one on one interaction between patient provider,

50
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:59,810
how are we doing things as populations and measures and ways we do things that get funded and standard the best in

51
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:07,130
experience because this not a perfect way to be done because we don't auspice and are addressing and we are upset.

52
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:12,680
Yeah, you do that. And so so the outcome is not always likely.

53
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:18,919
Yes. Yeah, no, absolutely. There are certainly flaws to many of these ways that we consider.

54
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:25,639
And so they're they're very imperfect tools for sure. So let's start with patient safety.

55
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:32,600
So we'll start with a vignette. So Miss Jones is a 67 year old patient with a BMI of 28 and a history of smoking.

56
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,050
She was admitted here at University Hospital for a hip replacement.

57
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:42,050
She developed a blood clot behind her left calf, which is called TVT, or deep vein thrombosis.

58
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:51,770
She was discharged without the DVT being diagnosed. The blood clot broke loose, became a pulmonary embolism from which she nearly died.

59
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:54,710
The complication resulted in a readmission and extended hospital stay.

60
00:06:55,130 --> 00:07:01,820
So this is an example of something that occurred to the patient outside of what the plan was, which was for them to get a hip replacement.

61
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:07,610
So these are very common.

62
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:13,730
They happen frequently, either widespread, they don't occur in surgical procedures, but occur in a lot of different areas.

63
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:22,580
You know, the this kind of famous study back in the nineties, you know, extrapolating from New York state data, about 180,000 people die each year,

64
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:30,350
partly a result of I had the Irish Republic injury, which is the safety injuries equivalent of three jumbo jet crashes every two days.

65
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:36,050
There have been some discussions about this kind of estimate. It may be a little bit overestimated.

66
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:37,040
There are some flaws with it.

67
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:44,780
But I think the point being is that, you know, the people that interact with health care system patients experience a large amount of harm.

68
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:53,749
Just interacting with the health care system initially. And autopsy studies have shown high rates of misdiagnosis that led to deaths.

69
00:07:53,750 --> 00:08:02,540
3549. So, again, we can argue the validity of these of these numbers, but I think the point remains is that anything greater than zero is,

70
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:06,320
I think, what any health care provider would tell you is not something that we want to have happen.

71
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:10,700
And so this is something that we're continually dealing with.

72
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:17,269
Even in the nineties when this started to become a hot topic in dealing with, you know, preventing estrogenic injury,

73
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:24,770
patient, patient harm has become a huge kind of focus of health care over the past few decades.

74
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:31,220
So the first thing that we obviously do is we want to measure how much or how much this is actually happening.

75
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:38,960
And there's been a huge number of patient safety measures that focus on specific kind of patient outcomes in the hospital.

76
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:43,750
So things like that, you know, patients that acquire a central line associated bloodstream infections,

77
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:48,890
supposed to have a central line in to give them nutrients and fluids and whatnot, doesn't get infected.

78
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:54,710
And there's increases because things like sepsis and ultimately that those things were relatively common.

79
00:08:55,140 --> 00:09:00,980
I say relatively common relative to now because we've done a lot of great work across the country to reduce those,

80
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:04,850
although it's still an issue also like hospitalized patients.

81
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:08,740
Google acquired catheter associated urinary tract infection.

82
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:12,820
Her patients in the hospital let me be immobile that you have a catheter.

83
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:18,639
These are also common sources of infection. And prior to the nineties were things that just happened.

84
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,620
And now we're measuring those. And those are kind of a very there are all sorts of now that we're measuring them,

85
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:30,550
we're having an idea of how frequently they're happening and designing high quality improvement initiatives around those measures.

86
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:39,850
And, you know, as a result of that, we've we've really improved a lot of these measures over recent years as estimates here,

87
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:44,139
you know, looking at adverse drug events have dropped in the last few years, pressure ulcers, not so much.

88
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:48,940
Those are always challenging hospital acquired infections and falls.

89
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:53,920
We've all seen kind of relative decreases. All of these are still relatively recent happening.

90
00:09:54,050 --> 00:10:06,310
So also one thing that's really challenging about measuring patient safety, patient harm is that it's really hard to measure these things.

91
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,620
Oftentimes, they can fly under the radar.

92
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:15,700
Also, it's there's there's an issue when we start to measure and we'll get through this, you know, through the through the semester here,

93
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:22,959
whenever we measure things, there's always an issue of, you know, not necessarily overdiagnosis because we're diagnosing it now.

94
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,820
We're seeing these huge rises in certain things.

95
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:32,060
Patient safety events are really, really challenging because they represent kind of sensitive things that happen,

96
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:37,330
things that shouldn't happen to the patient. So there's tends to be, I would say, underdiagnosed,

97
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:44,379
especially if there is there's an incentive to not diagnoses things because they could potentially be lawsuits and whatnot.

98
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:49,270
So there's always kind of issues, especially when we think of administrative data,

99
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:56,380
thinking about how we identify and measure these issues that are we actually documenting them well and capturing them,

100
00:10:57,070 --> 00:11:00,910
because if we have a hard time measuring things, it's gonna be a hard time improving it.

101
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:06,460
So that's a really important issue and thinking about addressing patient safety in measuring that.

102
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:13,380
So evidence based care. So are we doing the things that we should be doing?

103
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:21,300
So I switch gears a little bit. Mr. Travers is eight years old, has on a low educational level comes to see you for diabetes checkup.

104
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:26,700
He currently experiences mild diabetes related retinopathy or light sensitivity.

105
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:30,900
He has no social support at home. He's not motivated for self-management.

106
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:37,920
As low self-efficacy, poor self-management. His hemoglobin A1 C of a path and does not receive regular eye exam over the last year.

107
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,120
So how are we helping this patient when they come in?

108
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:47,010
Are we doing the things that we should be doing for it, for this patient that has some of these issues?

109
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:53,860
And when we think of evidence based care, we're often trying to think of processes.

110
00:11:53,880 --> 00:12:00,510
So are we doing the things that we should be doing? Rarely are we kind of measuring outcomes when it comes to evidence based care.

111
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:06,000
Examples of kind of evidence based care measures are are we giving them an annual HB one,

112
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:10,950
HB eight once the exam for patients with diabetes a regular check on their blood sugar?

113
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:14,610
Are we regularly screening women for breast cancer as they're over 40?

114
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:20,790
Do we are we giving patients active medication management for people that are diagnosed with progressive disease?

115
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:27,240
These are things that for which there's a lot of evidence that shows that these are good and are we doing that?

116
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:30,820
We're less concerned about the outcome because the outcome has been shown right.

117
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:33,810
If we know something's effective, when does a have to show the outcome?

118
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:36,930
We just got to make sure that we're doing what we're supposed to be doing for certain patients.

119
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:44,220
So patients tend to receive more than half of the recommended care they should receive.

120
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:49,950
So there's a lot of room for improvement.

121
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:56,070
And so this is a study that was done several years ago and during internal medicine that, you know,

122
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:01,440
if we look at kind of a population of people and are they adhering to quality

123
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:07,140
indicators based off of their specific kind of demographics or or clinical status?

124
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:11,700
Just over half of patients are actually receiving the care they should receive.

125
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:19,500
It's just not a great number and there's a lot of room for improvement there. It varies by type of care, so it's preventative or acute or chronic.

126
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,629
It's based off a function.

127
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:28,870
So if it's a follow up or a diagnosis and you can see here is it really is dependent on the type of care that they're trying to receive.

128
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:33,930
So when we think about it according to the type of care so we do really well in like

129
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:37,110
encounters are interventions like times where it's like an acute care settings.

130
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,480
We do really poorly in counseling and education. So are we counseling patients on smoking cessation?

131
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:47,340
Are we getting them to be educating them on diabetes management?

132
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:52,440
We do really poorly in those types of things. Those are also kind of soft things to deal with.

133
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:56,850
It's really easy to say, I sterilized and did all this stuff in a clinical setting.

134
00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:04,590
It takes a little bit different effort to deal with things like, you know, understanding patient history or understanding social support at home.

135
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:11,550
Are we educating them about how they manage their disease? And so we think about like how we're providing care.

136
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:17,670
It really is dependent on what we're talking about. But I think ultimately we don't do great.

137
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,400
But there's certainly room for improvement.

138
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:27,390
Is is that a is that a function of providing poor care or does that include people that don't have access to care?

139
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:30,870
I mean, is that an access problem or is it a provider not giving it properly?

140
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:38,550
I'd have to remember exactly how they define the population. I think it was patients that were kind of like within a health system and looking at.

141
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:45,629
So they were it was kind of already conditional on them being within a system.

142
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:49,890
So, you know, whether or not they're having access issues within a system is a different question.

143
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:55,350
But I think there are certainly issues when it comes to patients that are not and they're probably not getting any of these things overnight.

144
00:14:55,350 --> 00:15:01,980
So this is probably the best case scenario in terms of patients who have access to the services would vary based on that as well.

145
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:14,900
So, you know, in addition to the fact that we don't do well, it takes a long time for us to actually implement evidence based care.

146
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:25,760
You know, if we look chronologically in the early nineties, beta blockers are an important way for to help patients have heart attacks.

147
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:28,670
This is shown to be effective in the early nineties.

148
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:34,370
And, you know, less than 30%, less than 40% of patients are actually getting these after a heart attack.

149
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:42,410
Only until like the mid 2000 did we actually get to a point where, you know, about 90% of patients were getting beta blockers.

150
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:48,080
The ten, 12 year lag, which is shocking in that it would take that long.

151
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,840
Now that we have the trial evidence, we know that it's beneficial,

152
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:58,009
that that long curve that we see here in terms of guidelines in 1994 included in accreditation standards,

153
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:03,230
it's it takes years and years for us to really make it part of common practice.

154
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:07,160
And there's all sorts of interventions that people do to try to improve these things.

155
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:16,430
There's a fall out of industry around how do we help physicians and providers provide evidence based care that they should be providing.

156
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:22,219
And so there's still a huge kind of issue that we deal with in terms of like how do we reduce

157
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:25,820
the lag in terms of when we know something is beneficial and how do we implement it correctly?

158
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:29,180
So implementation science for those that are aware of that are that's a huge

159
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:31,610
part of that is like how do we get people to do what they should be doing?

160
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:43,420
But in general, you know, many of the improvements in quality have been for the measures for the measures of evidence based care.

161
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:54,960
So so I think we have once we start measuring these things, it becomes a lot easier to approve them without being able to measure.

162
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:58,150
We can't improve it. So that's kind of the the key part here.

163
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:06,309
And if we look at this is a study related to the hospital value is purchasing program,

164
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:10,000
which essentially provided hospitals with incentives to provide quality care.

165
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:12,280
Many of these things, once we started measuring them,

166
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:18,580
we're seeing improvements and and really even the financial incentives are not really that effective at improving them.

167
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:26,890
But it's just we see these kind of larger trends of like once we're able to measure these quality factors, these improvements will occur.

168
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:33,460
And there is some evidence that the financial incentives can help that.

169
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:38,169
But ultimately it really rests on the ability to measure these improvements.

170
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:42,250
And that's where we can start to make change.

171
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:55,210
So I guess one of the big issues is if we improve all these evidence based care measures, can we improve patient outcomes for people doing?

172
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:02,900
Sounds like a trick question, but I'd say yes. Yeah, ideally.

173
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:06,440
Right. I mean, that's that's the idea is that we know something works.

174
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:14,330
We get more people to do it. We should be improving patient outcomes. The question is always are who are the people in which we are improving?

175
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:17,330
So, you know, there's you know, patients are not all the same.

176
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:25,760
And if we're improving in the kind of lowest acuity, healthiest patients, are we actually improving the health of the population at the margin?

177
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,280
Maybe, but maybe not.

178
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:35,870
We mean that we so it's it's really thinking about not only just measuring the average, but like in patients where it may be most beneficial.

179
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:41,000
And that's where kind of more data is really needed to understand who are the patients we should target in,

180
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:49,070
you know, addressing quality issues in there. So I think largely, yes, it should it should case improve patient outcomes.

181
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:52,460
But the question is always a little bit muddier. It is kind of a tricky question.

182
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,930
Yes. In fact, a lot. Yeah. Yeah.

183
00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:03,860
In theory, yes. In practice. I mean, it's you know, one thing is there's no silver bullet for one patient.

184
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:07,640
But that's that's where I think we often try to get to.

185
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:16,379
All right. Switching to overseas. So now we know what we should be doing. Now, are we doing too much of it right now?

186
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:23,880
This kind of deal with the other side of the coin is. So Lara was screened for osteoporosis almost a decade ago.

187
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:28,950
Her bone mineral density tests showed that her T score is -1.8 for primary care.

188
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:34,320
Doctors told her that she was at risk for fracture, even though she had none of the risk factors that would lead to that.

189
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:40,350
She started on hormone replacement therapy, which has been shown to increase bone density and reduce the chance of fracture.

190
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:46,020
But after evidence from a randomized trial, the hormone replacement therapy demonstrated some harmful effects.

191
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:51,570
Her doctor suggested that she stopped medication and said try a different one for her osteoporosis.

192
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:56,999
She was started on bisphosphonate by phosphate, and then she developed terrible pain when swallowing.

193
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:04,890
She referred referred to a gastroenterologist who performed in endoscopy, found she had severe inflammation ulcers, which is a known side effect.

194
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:09,990
She was then switched to another medicine. Esophagitis healed, but a painful rash appeared all over her body.

195
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:14,790
So she was referred to as the apologist who suspected the rash was due to Haitian medication stopped.

196
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:23,920
And now she's back at square one. With all this stuff, because she had a potential risk for osteoporosis, although she didn't have other risk factors.

197
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:31,440
This is one story of many in which there's this kind of I think someone had mentioned this cascading snowball of like, we do this.

198
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:36,330
And then because of that, we do this and we do that, we do this. And it's one thing after the other.

199
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:39,470
When did we really need to do the first thing in the first place? Right.

200
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:47,370
So this is just an example of how overuse can occur, not just in the setting of one specific thing, but the cascading effects of multiple things.

201
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:56,129
And this is a huge problem. And I think, you know, Peter Orszag, who has been in the government a few years ago, that services provided,

202
00:20:56,130 --> 00:21:02,760
even though it's defined it as a service being provided, those risk of harm exceeds the benefit or when it's not warranted on medical grounds.

203
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:06,870
So we're just doing it for the sake of doing it, even though it may not actually improve and may harm vision.

204
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:16,440
So some examples. Patients who have stable coronary artery disease, so they have a blockage, but they don't have any symptoms.

205
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:20,970
They're functionally fine. They don't you know, the stress test doesn't show anything.

206
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:29,010
For a while, people were stenting these patients just because they had a partial blockage, even though they didn't have any symptoms.

207
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:35,220
And, you know, any time you do these procedures, there's a huge you know, there's a risk of complications.

208
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:40,020
There's a risk for issues down the road. So that's been seen as something that we probably shouldn't be doing.

209
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:47,670
We should be medically managing these patients. CT scans, often unnecessary or they're over, they're done multiple times.

210
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:52,380
There is an exposure risk for patients every time they have these things in terms of radiation.

211
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:58,290
And again, I think someone that uses the example, the treatment cascades, where you have a CT scan done,

212
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:04,739
you have this kind of serendipitous finding something else, then you have by biopsy for this and it leads to all sorts of different issues.

213
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:13,950
And so using CT scans, you know, excessively can lead to all sorts of overuse and are prostate specific antigen screening for prostate cancer.

214
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:19,110
High rates of false positives. False positives, when we think of screening are kind of what we're trying to avoid,

215
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:25,320
where we ultimately more unnecessary biopsies, unnecessary treatment for slow growing cancers.

216
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:31,739
So again, it's like not only are we just doing the test or the screening of it appropriately,

217
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:37,350
but we're actually doing something that maybe, you know, maybe a totally unnecessary and causing harm to the patient.

218
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:40,829
Spinal fusion surgery is another way this happens lately.

219
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:49,760
I think spine surgery is very expensive and it may not be very effective and may actually make far of software for our patient.

220
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:55,680
Other kind of noninvasive things first. So these are examples of examples of overuse.

221
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:59,190
They're not the only ones, but these are ones that are commonly cited as being problematic,

222
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:02,460
both in terms of far cost for prevention and health care system.

223
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:11,130
So not only are we doing this, but physicians actually in the US receive a high percentage of the care to be unnecessary,

224
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:15,389
which is kind of shocking because they're kind of the ones to it to a certain extent.

225
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:24,180
So if we think of, you know, this was a study that was done when they surveyed physicians and you know, you can see that the figure here where,

226
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:30,540
you know, five, 6% of physicians viewed none of the care as overtreatment, that they were doing everything they should.

227
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:38,390
And, you know, the largest proportion is the plurality here, about 15, you know, about 30%,

228
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:45,630
30, 35% of doctors under 15 to a third of the care that were providing is is unnecessary.

229
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:51,460
So and then when we look at kind of what they viewed as unnecessary, things that were, you know,

230
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:57,870
testing for prescription medications, less so procedures, I think they viewed procedures as less problematic in terms of overuse.

231
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:03,540
But things like screening the medications that it was more likely to view as being overuse than than procedures.

232
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:11,690
So really the big issue here is how well can we determine whether something's necessary?

233
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:15,060
I think a lot of this is kind of, you know, armchair, you know,

234
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,479
Monday morning quarterbacking how they should done as they should have done

235
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:21,260
that it's very easy to look in hindsight after something a cascade happens.

236
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:24,650
But how do we really know when something's appropriate or not appropriate?

237
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:29,050
This is a really sticky thing. Some. It's not always a reliable measure.

238
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:36,380
And so a big issue in terms of overuse is do we have good evidence that something is not good for patients?

239
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:40,549
And then can we measure that? Well. Those are really challenging things in this field.

240
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:47,990
And people have started to do more in that in that space, even though it appropriateness is still a challenge to many of these.

241
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:56,540
So the choosing wisely campaign, I don't know if folks have heard of that is something that has been happening for the last few years here and they've

242
00:24:56,540 --> 00:25:02,959
been really trying to address that is like can we measure overuse and can we provide some guidelines around it?

243
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:09,650
And so they've developed like 600 some recommendations, over 80 specialties that say here are things that we should or should not do.

244
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:17,180
These are things that are likely not to provide benefit for a patient or more likely to cause harm or no benefit whatsoever.

245
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:22,520
And so the goal of this is to really help, you know, conversations between patients and doctors to say,

246
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:27,709
you know, these are things that are either supported by evidence. They're not duplicative.

247
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:32,120
It's not repeating things as a frequent partner, truly necessary or truly not necessary.

248
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:37,640
So this is a campaign that people have been focusing on to try to provide more evidence,

249
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:41,760
like don't do imaging for low back pain unless they're red flags.

250
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:45,500
I think that's a way of reducing our harmful exposure to radiation.

251
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:52,579
Don't routinely provide antibiotics for acute to mild sinusitis unless they have symptoms for seven more days, since it's,

252
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:57,860
you know, not saying don't do anything ever, but like let's try to put some guardrails around when we do things.

253
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:02,450
And then this will also help us to measure whether or not we're doing too much or too little.

254
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:14,680
So the Choosing Wisely campaign had done a report a few years ago that looked at trends in these low value care services.

255
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:18,580
And and really, once they started measuring them,

256
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:26,320
they looked over time as after the kind of initiation of the choosing wisely campaign and really found that they hadn't really been,

257
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:34,239
which is kind of sobering, but identified all these things that we shouldn't be doing or we should be a little more careful of doing,

258
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:39,820
or we should do more of this, you know, high value care, and we're still doing it.

259
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:43,450
And so really, there's there's kind of more concerted efforts in this area.

260
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:48,849
This is relatively kind of small changes suggest that we need to do a little bit more in terms

261
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:54,390
of getting into practices and trying to convince providers that what they're doing is overused.

262
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:59,440
It's not good health care. So that's kind of where we're at with this.

263
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:07,899
We're also there are things in Michigan that we're doing to try to reduce this are our group along with MSK,

264
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:14,000
you see the Michigan Surgical Quality Collaborative has been working on issues related to overtesting, pre-surgery.

265
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:21,420
And there's a lot of things like doing a doing a cardiac stress test before an appendectomy or before that

266
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:26,230
to be like we shouldn't be doing that because not only will it delay a potentially important procedure,

267
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:30,550
but it may be a false positive. And now we're just doing more work for no reason.

268
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:39,879
I just wanted to comment. I think what health care administrators think is overused and what doctors think is overuse, it's completely different.

269
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:44,080
Like, for the example, with the osteoporosis, from a medical perspective,

270
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:51,010
everything was done correctly and even insurance would probably agree that this is the way things should have gone.

271
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:58,480
And the fact that she had the side effects does not say that, oh, we shouldn't use that on anyone and just possibly so.

272
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,840
Correct. Right, exactly.

273
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:05,210
And I think that's you're right in that they should have been, you know,

274
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:11,020
not doing things or doing things based off of the kind of cascade that I think the example was illustrative of,

275
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:15,579
like, should we be doing things in the first place? Because everything subsequent to that was probably find it should have been doing.

276
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:19,750
Those things are not doing those things. They're making the decision that they did. They were being correct about it.

277
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:27,480
And I think the idea was that if you do cheat right on a on a bone density scan, postmenopausal women.

278
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:34,150
Exactly. And so I think that was it. Yeah. And so I think the goal is like we need to we need to get to those, you know,

279
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:39,940
index events of potential cascades and they call this kind of overuse cascades.

280
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:44,229
And they identify these things within within data to say where are common ways in

281
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:47,500
which we're creating all of this work that we didn't need to do in the first place.

282
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:54,970
And then, you know, it maybe you we come up with some guidelines and maybe that still happens, but maybe it doesn't happen in that frequency.

283
00:28:55,540 --> 00:29:02,319
And so I think that the goal of things like choosing wisely is like, can we try to like minimize as much as possible?

284
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:07,360
Because I think there will always be overuse in some way, shape or form screening kind of guidelines around it.

285
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:13,080
Well, I think a lot of it is a function of how people are compensated or an orthopedic

286
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:17,290
surgeon is going to recommend I've been recommended spine surgery for 15 years.

287
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:23,200
I have nothing wrong with my spine. But and tell me as a physician, 15 years every time I see an orthopedic surgeon.

288
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:29,280
Right. So and an interventional radiologist is going to want to put a stent in your leg, even if there's nothing wrong.

289
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:34,809
So it's it's a largely a function of what they get compensated for is absolutely right.

290
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:44,770
I mean, I think that's a huge driver of overuse. Is that the word penis or the air is they have no repercussions for the cascade.

291
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:49,690
Right. And there, you know, their repercussion is, did I do the procedure right?

292
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:55,480
Was it effective? Did I reduce harm within that specific domain of like the care episode that I see them?

293
00:29:55,900 --> 00:30:00,040
But whatever happens afterwards, well, that's back in the GP, that's the general practitioners problem.

294
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:07,120
And so hold on that because that's a huge that's a huge thing and we'll have a discussion at the end of class.

295
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:12,910
Look at how all these things kind of tie together on to Andrew's accusation.

296
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:22,510
I think I do. I do know that that like, you know, financial incentives are a thing and they're phenomenon.

297
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:32,740
But I think one thing that's left unsaid so far is that you you have in the U.S. physicians who are really worried about their medical liability.

298
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:38,900
So a lot of overuse. It's also in addition to being incentivized by you know,

299
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:52,780
finance is related to see why defensive practice of medicine and and I learned last semester from Richard hurt that that is not always

300
00:30:53,470 --> 00:31:04,600
the case that in that in the NHS or in Japan that if you follow the nationally provided evidence based guidelines that it protects you.

301
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:11,720
From medical liability. And to me, like, I mean, that that sounds like an elegant solution to a lot of years.

302
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:16,989
Of course. Yeah. And I think that people I think that our our system probably lags in that case,

303
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:22,420
because only now are we coming up with these kind of guidelines for overuse and low value care.

304
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:27,490
Because I think you're right that people are by being caught, you're doing more by being conservative.

305
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:34,080
Right, if that makes sense. So I should probably double check some and do this additional scans work.

306
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:40,780
And that can be that kind of defensive practice can add to a lot of overuse and certainly recognized by many.

307
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:49,060
So I think the point the point being, I think what you're both are saying is that the perspective of of whether you're a patient,

308
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:55,510
whether your doctor or the administrator is like everyone's got different understanding of what overuse means,

309
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:58,480
how we define it, whether it's appropriate or inappropriate,

310
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:03,429
because maybe a patient views it entirely different that, you know, why are we doing this?

311
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:06,670
Or they may be, why are you not doing this?

312
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:09,700
I feel like I should be having, you know, why are you not doing this scan?

313
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:13,870
I think that's also so it's trying to get people on the same page of understanding,

314
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:18,340
you know, the pros and cons and coming up with kind of unified definitions.

315
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:20,780
It's really challenging. Yeah.

316
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:28,729
So if you guys are really interested in this, then you want to think about this from, like, the politics that we've discussed since last semester.

317
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:35,270
There's a book called Unhealthy Politics, and it talks about why evidence care medicine is not big in the U.S.

318
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:43,970
Pick your hand and you can other countries. And it has to do with like how the accountability structure is in the US, where it's very horizontal,

319
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:49,130
that physicians are accountable to each other as patients and not necessarily to the government.

320
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,940
And why is our politics for saying that?

321
00:32:52,940 --> 00:33:02,340
And why is it really difficult to do like these decisions off of evidence based research rather than it has to do with political accountability?

322
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:14,210
So if you're interested in healthy politics like patient experience.

323
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:19,730
So this is one that has had really grown over the past few years.

324
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:26,750
And again, it's kind of evaluates whether the extent to which patients perceive their experience of receiving care was high quality,

325
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:32,270
comfortable, compassionate. Um, it's kind of amazing that it took us this long to figure out, like,

326
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:36,409
whether patients are actually happy with what they're doing or unhappy with what they're getting,

327
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:39,410
or they feel that their partners feel like they're being ignored.

328
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:48,260
So like hospitalized patients who reported that their pain was always while their pain was always more controlled or otherwise,

329
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:51,720
patients who strongly agreed that they understood their care when they weren't.

330
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:58,110
These are ways in which we can help to understand whether or not because ultimately, when, you know,

331
00:33:58,130 --> 00:34:04,010
especially if it's like if there's an acute care issue and a patient goes home, they're no longer in the care of a hospital.

332
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:08,209
And so it's really important to kind of make sure that their they understand what they need to do.

333
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:17,960
They understand the their medication regimen or they understand whether that, you know, why they need to walk, you know, get up and walk around.

334
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:27,260
You know, it's really important to understand that. But and I think the challenge, again, is always the issue here is, you know.

335
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:37,190
If we enhance patient, you know, it is enhancing patient experience and focusing on that aligned with other aspects of quality.

336
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:43,280
So like if we make sure that every patient is happy when we leave the hospital, are we also providing them?

337
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:52,940
Why not? Because, you know, people want an antibiotic that isn't be and they walk away pissed if they don't get it.

338
00:34:53,270 --> 00:35:00,410
People get that if you refer them to Child Protective Services for neglecting their kid and they can, you know, rate zero stars.

339
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:10,910
But it was still the right thing to do. Right. So it's really it's a very slim view of health care quality when you get the patient experience.

340
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:15,170
And I really dedicate it to my patients experiences.

341
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:21,530
So I don't say that because I think the experience doesn't matter. I just think this is a really bad way to measure it.

342
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,290
Right. And I think, you know. Go ahead.

343
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:30,590
I think when you're measuring patient experience, you have to be specific on what part of the patient experience you're measuring, too.

344
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:37,480
So if you're looking at a patient's experience of team based health care, for example, that does lead to better outcomes.

345
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:42,020
So it matters like not maybe not so much like pain or no pain,

346
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:48,560
but what are their perceptions of specific things related to how their health care providers interact with one another?

347
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:53,270
Right. Yeah. So, like, a lot of this is subjective.

348
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:58,310
Yeah. But I was reading like, hospitalized patients strongly agree that they understood their care.

349
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:02,120
So many people think or claim that they understand,

350
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:08,269
like the instructions and then like there's a thousand questions because maybe it wasn't explained clearly as it needed to be.

351
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:11,450
Or maybe these, like, in a way that they didn't understand.

352
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:17,300
Mm hmm. So, like, I think how you feel in the hospital versus, like,

353
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:25,520
how they actually carry out that aftercare discharge very differently with a physician, of course.

354
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,320
And I think. Yeah, go ahead.

355
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:34,430
I think it all just comes down to the fact that you go to doctors because you don't fully know what's good for you in certain scenarios.

356
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:41,030
So we can't possibly rely on a only patient experience as telling our quality of care.

357
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:47,060
So all these things are, I would suggest, measurement issues.

358
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:58,210
Right. It's how we word the question, are we getting to an effective are we trying to understand the experience from from a place of quality?

359
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:03,970
Right. Like, are we is the question we're asking going to get to some crucial component of care that work?

360
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:07,670
We try to understand, I think the first one in terms of pain control,

361
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:11,720
many would look at the last 20 years of what's happened in this country and say maybe that was

362
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:16,010
not a great question to be asking because people say it's your pain control and they say no.

363
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:20,389
And they would say, well, we want to make sure everyone's painkillers controlled and we have some over prescribing things like opioids.

364
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:26,690
But now I think at least what's happening locally, I know when people go in for heart surgery,

365
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:30,620
our physicians give them an expectation that you will be in pain.

366
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:36,650
It will not be comfortable. But we're going to do our best to manage that in a way that's safe and effective for you.

367
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:42,800
And do you feel that? You know, and so they ask them, do you feel like your expectations of pain were well understood?

368
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:48,230
So they try to get at things not not whether or not how you feel that you feel like your expectations were met.

369
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:54,050
Do you feel that you were a partner? You know, these are these I think, again, these are all measurement questions of like,

370
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:58,880
what are we when we ask the question, what are we actually trying to get out of it? So, you know, Alison, to your point, like,

371
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:04,790
are you happy is a really tricky question to me may have totally backward side

372
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:08,600
effects or did you understand again it's like what are we trying to get at?

373
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:12,649
And so when it comes to patient experience, it's really tricky.

374
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:18,860
And so like, do we actually know other patient experiences like actually related to patient safety, clinical effectiveness?

375
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:27,210
It's do you think the measurement part is is addressable too in terms of like bias?

376
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:34,730
I mean, so for instance, I had colleagues who got patient feedback, you know,

377
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:43,639
neatly summarized by the university who wanted us to know and to change in response to this feedback that would say, I can't understand my doctor.

378
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:49,640
Her accent is too thick, my doctor keeps taking maternity leave.

379
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:58,000
And so I went to that. And so, I mean, there's really there's there's a way to, like,

380
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:08,780
contribute to burnout and to the relationship and and to just be racist and biased and all kinds of terrible things.

381
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:12,860
I'm not sure you can address by changing my mind.

382
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:16,730
Do you think it's it's reasonable to try to fix that.

383
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:21,920
So I'm not a measurement scientist in the way that like, I'm not I'm not a survey methodologies.

384
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:27,380
I you know, I don't I don't have the expertise in that. I know that there are several people that their careers are based around doing that.

385
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:29,210
What you're talking about is good. How do we.

386
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:35,930
How do we remove bias from questions or get to things that are asked questions in a way that are less susceptible to bias?

387
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:42,349
I don't think we'll ever get to a perfect situation because those are always going to color the issues that we have.

388
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:51,830
And so I know that those are those are issues that are trying to be addressed, but I'm sure we're probably lacking in many of them.

389
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:57,530
You have to ask questions that are not open ended. How long were you waiting in the lobby?

390
00:39:57,530 --> 00:40:01,220
Was it 5 to 10 minutes and 15 minutes? Was it 15 to 20?

391
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,700
How long was it before you returned to the hospital? One month. Three months.

392
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:09,770
Was it a regular? You know, I think those are the kind of questions that you have to ask to measure those things objectively.

393
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:14,170
Yeah. And so that's the challenge with experience writers.

394
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:21,950
Is experience subjective or subjective? I mean, there are parts of it that you can objectively say yes or no or this or that,

395
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:28,430
but getting it subjective experience and quantifying it and then objective ways is really a challenge.

396
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:34,260
But there's two. Yeah. I just wanted to ask.

397
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:42,930
This might come off the wrong way, but if we're measuring the effectiveness of care and overuse and all the other metrics,

398
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:47,730
what does measuring patient experience add to the quality?

399
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:51,420
So ultimately, the patient is the one at the center of this.

400
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:59,549
And I think and what I think the study here shows is that there is some examples of where engaging a patient and having

401
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:05,310
a patient be a part of the conversation and having to be a partner actually enhances the effectiveness of the care.

402
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:11,910
And so and not only within the care, within the confines of a specific episode, but longitudinally.

403
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:16,020
Right. And I think for people that. Right. So like, you know, do you understand yes or no?

404
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:21,809
And really helping them to understand that and have them be, you know, be a part of understanding their long course of their disease.

405
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:29,340
If it's a chronic disease, you know, having them engaged in and measuring whether or not they understand is challenging as that can be,

406
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:35,190
will help you to figure out, are we are we totally missing the boat on specific areas of care?

407
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:42,569
And, you know, if we're if we're struggling with engaging our patients and having them, you know, understand and effectively kind of treat their,

408
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:48,149
you know, self-manage their disease, that's what I think these things are trying to get at is like, do I feel that I'm a partner in this?

409
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:51,780
Do I feel that I'm actively, you know, I can manage my own disease?

410
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:55,080
And so I think that's where people would say that these are going to change.

411
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:04,950
And. John and and then yeah, I guess, I mean, fundamentally too, with any survey or review too, you're going to get bifurcated answers, right?

412
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:09,810
Patients that had a great experience of patients that had a terrible effect, not responding to your survey.

413
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:15,240
Right. If you win and it was a normal checkup and they did your blood work and everything was fine, like,

414
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:19,980
are you going to take the 10 minutes to fill out the survey that Michigan Medicine emails to you?

415
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:23,320
Probably not, right? Yeah. Yeah.

416
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:26,580
And that's that's the challenge of objectifying a lot of these experiences.

417
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,030
I was just going to say that I,

418
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:38,819
I appreciate the comment and and I think it's it doesn't land wrongly to me because I think it's possible to value the patient experience in

419
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:48,960
a in a 1 to 1 relationship or in a patient to clinic relationship in a way that you can meaningfully address someone's individual needs.

420
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:55,410
My problem with patient experience data is that you can't aggregate it and apply it to systems.

421
00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:05,270
It just doesn't work that way. And, you know, I agree with what you guys are saying, but I think there's also a question, again,

422
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:12,659
thinking back to our last class like equity and how do we measure whether different groups of patients are being treated equally or not?

423
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:16,319
And that, I think, is something that could be captured through these surveys,

424
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:21,090
like if we're getting consistently negative results from like African-American patients,

425
00:43:21,090 --> 00:43:25,709
for example, as compared to white patients, that's important to capture.

426
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:30,240
And I'm not sure what other way to counter that outside of like patient service.

427
00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:37,250
And I can speak to the fact that we've we've looked through these patient experience things within our own clinics,

428
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:44,159
and I've talked with my physicians about it. And I know the way they use them is not necessarily like we need to get this benchmark

429
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:47,310
or we're not going to get paid or we're not going to get a bonus or whatever.

430
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,850
They view them as ways to help them self-diagnose what's going on.

431
00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:55,050
And so not to say that that's how it's always used because it's not.

432
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:59,340
I know administrations often use those as ways to leverage points,

433
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:03,750
but I think those are ways in which they can be used effectively is like we're

434
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:07,230
having this issue like patients are saying they're not they're not happy.

435
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,060
Can we understand a little bit more of that?

436
00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:18,360
And so I think it can be a tool to help a clinic self-diagnose where they could potentially improve in terms of how they care for their patients.

437
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:21,740
But, you know, it's not to say that that's always the right thing to do.

438
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:26,820
It's very thoughtful and relatively small place to implement.

439
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:30,719
Right. Feedback, yeah, yeah, yeah.

440
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:38,910
We've been talking a lot about like taking the, like the questions we ask and how the process of taking the surveys.

441
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:48,600
I think also the way we analyze it too is extremely important, which is considering which groups are having the worst experience.

442
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:54,720
And this not I think the analysis part I should say is as people accurate, as the types of questions being asked.

443
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:58,229
Yeah, absolutely. I mean, it goes into a little bit of like data mining.

444
00:44:58,230 --> 00:45:03,600
Like are we just finding things for the sake of finding things and like all of a sudden something is a deviant and we just address that?

445
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:08,729
Or are we actually going through it, like you're saying, with an actual like plan of like, this is what we're trying to understand.

446
00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:10,650
And so I think we are you know,

447
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:16,950
we can certainly our health care system is guilty of of data mining and just doing things again for the sake of doing that.

448
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:20,280
But yeah. Any other thoughts on patient experience?

449
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:26,400
All right. So effectiveness of care.

450
00:45:26,610 --> 00:45:34,499
So. Are we when we when we do things, are we is the care that's being provided effective?

451
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:38,819
It evaluates a patient outcome conditional on treatment. So we do something to this patient.

452
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:41,340
What is their outcome? Is it good? Is it bad?

453
00:45:41,730 --> 00:45:50,219
So things like six year, six year cancer survival rates or 30 day mortality for patients of heart attack, functional status after knee replacement.

454
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:52,820
So like this is actually measuring the patient outcomes.

455
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:57,720
So relative to like evidence based care we're looking at, are we doing things the way we're supposed to be doing them?

456
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:02,160
This is once we do them, how well are our patients doing from that?

457
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:05,610
And these are kind of what we think of like quality outcomes is where we originally

458
00:46:05,610 --> 00:46:09,900
kind of started was like our patients faring after we get them into the hospital.

459
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:14,799
This is probably where the U.S. does the best once we treat them.

460
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:20,700
And this is not universal that obviously switch situations when we may not be, but once we actually treat the patient,

461
00:46:20,850 --> 00:46:26,040
the U.S. health care system does a really good job by and large for these patients relative to other countries.

462
00:46:26,490 --> 00:46:35,430
So cancer care is regarded as being one of the most advanced in the world patients with with severe bowel disease and elder placements.

463
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:42,660
Patients in the U.S. do really, really well. There's many examples of that where the U.S. leads and new therapeutics, you know,

464
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:49,889
combination drug therapy for HIV, other other areas where the U.S. is probably a leader in this.

465
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:51,810
And so a couple of examples.

466
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:59,970
So rates of coronary revascularization after heart attack, someone has a heart attack, they need a catheter and they need a standard heart surgery.

467
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:03,239
We do really well in that.

468
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:12,000
So when someone has a heart attack, how, you know, how quickly are we able to get them or how well are we able to treat them medically or surgically?

469
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:18,239
And the U.S. leads in many of these categories. And so this example where the U.S. does really well, because we spend a lot of money on it,

470
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:23,610
we spend a lot of effort to get patients to the hospital when they have heart attacks and to treat them.

471
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:28,469
Cancer survival rates are as good as or better than many poor countries.

472
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:35,549
So these are survival rates, five year survival rates from prostate, breast, colorectal, lung cancer relative to the U.K., Netherlands.

473
00:47:35,550 --> 00:47:41,220
And we do very well. So again, we there's a lot of things that are wrong with our health care system.

474
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:45,180
But once we get people in the system and treat them, they actually do pretty well.

475
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:50,790
But these are also ways in which we can measure quality, try to understand how well we do things.

476
00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:55,830
Again, these are all margins. It's not to say that every place we go to does really well.

477
00:47:55,860 --> 00:48:01,799
There's a whole literature on possible variation outcomes or geographic variation in outcomes,

478
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:05,130
and there's plenty of that in the U.S. So it's not to say that we do well everywhere.

479
00:48:05,370 --> 00:48:08,670
We do well in many places and some places better than others.

480
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:12,480
And so there's a whole kind of area around improving quality across the board.

481
00:48:13,950 --> 00:48:18,210
And that's as I think, where a lot of the efforts are placed around clinical outcomes.

482
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:26,700
So if we do, if we have really highly effective care, is that good enough to improve the health of the population?

483
00:48:27,230 --> 00:48:33,450
I would say yes. Nobody is really, really good at doing here.

484
00:48:33,450 --> 00:48:40,950
But that doesn't improve anybody. No. Yeah, I'm sure you.

485
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:45,840
Right. So population growth.

486
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:57,680
So this is where we view how at the macro level, the people in this country, how well are they faring just in terms of their overall health?

487
00:48:58,490 --> 00:49:05,510
There are ways that we can measure this. So life expectancy, maternal mortality, prevalence of diabetes, quality of life.

488
00:49:05,930 --> 00:49:09,840
These are things that are kind of not anchored to specific conditions.

489
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:13,890
They're not anchored to specific procedures or diagnoses.

490
00:49:13,910 --> 00:49:25,130
This is just how is our population doing as a whole? This is probably where the U.S. does worse than most kind of advanced countries, unfortunately.

491
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:29,970
Life expectancy, for example, is declining in recent years.

492
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:38,540
COVID obviously had a huge part in that, as you see it in the last year, in 2020, but it's not absent.

493
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:43,700
Other issues you can see, even starting in 2014, we start to see a slow, slow decline in life expectancy.

494
00:49:44,570 --> 00:49:50,120
And so in a lot of this is because mortality is increasing.

495
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:51,889
And I think this is something we talked about recently.

496
00:49:51,890 --> 00:49:58,580
But if we look at the lines here, as soon as 2029, 2011 hits, we start to see the increase in mortality.

497
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:05,120
So and this is not this is overall, I think if we looked at, you know, a lot of different domains,

498
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:09,770
we would see this cardiovascular disease just being the one that I'm most familiar with.

499
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:15,160
We were having really good rates of cardiovascular health in the past ten, 15 years.

500
00:50:15,170 --> 00:50:20,810
We started to see a decline again. We're not doing as well. And so this is not good.

501
00:50:20,910 --> 00:50:27,799
It's happening everywhere and a lot of it for a lot of different reasons. But that's an example of where this population,

502
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:34,400
even though we're seeing all of these advancements in quality and clinical effectiveness and new therapies and whatnot,

503
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:38,330
we're still not seeing the payoff there. Okay.

504
00:50:38,930 --> 00:50:43,760
So we talked about these kind of six major dimensions of health care quality.

505
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:51,530
And previously, we talked about these different issues related to our health care system, how we do well and do and don't do well.

506
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:57,530
So we'd like to do now is kind of split into similar groups like last time just around local people around you.

507
00:50:57,890 --> 00:51:01,430
And I want groups to come up with two ways in which the things on the left side.

508
00:51:01,670 --> 00:51:08,450
So fragmentation, high costs for patients, barriers to access lead to issues in quality that we talk about that.

509
00:51:09,350 --> 00:51:12,469
So we'll take about 10 minutes or so and go through that.

510
00:51:12,470 --> 00:51:31,560
So give us some groups. And then what I do we did last time go around the class and really talk about this issue that happens over time,

511
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:39,230
altering absolutely massive inequalities.

512
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:57,160
That is, I feel like this test we draw the inequalities affects the patient experience with these eating disorders.

513
00:51:57,180 --> 00:52:13,590
Like it's like I thought Dr. Spencer talking about here.

514
00:52:17,390 --> 00:52:25,600
So. As he was talking, I was getting ready to.

515
00:52:26,280 --> 00:53:26,820
The question that I have no idea what it's like to be hungry because it's not going to be right in my heart.

516
00:53:31,810 --> 00:53:45,010
I mean, I don't understand that.

517
00:53:56,170 --> 00:54:03,260
Yeah, but, you know.

518
00:54:21,430 --> 00:54:28,310
Yeah. I was like ten.

519
00:54:28,370 --> 00:54:50,760
I don't even know how many people think of anything better to say that I don't mind.

520
00:54:51,650 --> 00:54:55,850
You may not be one other person is exactly what wanted to do.

521
00:54:56,200 --> 00:55:13,900
So I don't want to waste something and one is going to help me.

522
00:55:13,910 --> 00:55:32,470
Oh, my God. Do you know what I'm saying?

523
00:55:34,170 --> 00:56:07,900
That's so true. And I just wanted to make sure that you are getting it right right now,

524
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:52,840
just like it's someone else at the same time, they can have another dance like this.

525
00:56:58,110 --> 00:57:02,570
You? Yeah.

526
00:57:05,950 --> 00:57:28,150
That's like that. Yeah. Like it'd be like, oh, my God.

527
00:57:28,810 --> 00:57:37,320
Oh, my God.

528
00:57:39,410 --> 00:57:50,550
Because I don't know that.

529
00:57:52,110 --> 00:58:05,560
Really, like. I don't know.

530
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:23,050
Think I want to tell you all I'm going to say.

531
00:58:23,770 --> 00:58:42,240
It's just like I didn't say my mom said what to do with the family.

532
00:58:42,430 --> 00:59:24,490
So it's not like it's just like for like they said that especially now that they're trying to do it for a guy like me all the time, I was nervous.

533
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:46,150
Like everything just started to feel like I was like, oh, my God.

534
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:55,730
I just feel like, I don't know.

535
00:59:55,900 --> 01:00:11,139
Like, I left our memories away for the last year.

536
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:18,440
Never that I tried to be like yoga, just like the other day.

537
01:00:18,510 --> 01:00:32,230
I don't like the rest of your body.

538
01:00:34,190 --> 01:00:40,370
But you're mean. Yeah.

539
01:00:42,900 --> 01:01:00,550
I just. I just.

540
01:01:01,050 --> 01:01:05,430
Yeah, that's right. That's right.

541
01:01:09,210 --> 01:01:12,330
That's right.

542
01:01:13,650 --> 01:01:23,730
That's right. And then, I mean, we've got to make it seem like we really.

543
01:01:24,300 --> 01:02:05,860
Yeah. I mean, I, I would surely be helping someone who is another do business and I mean, it's not I mean,

544
01:02:09,630 --> 01:02:28,090
I think everybody would still be alive and provide any feedback on our society, you know, but.

545
01:02:31,950 --> 01:02:38,670
Yeah. Yeah, it must be different.

546
01:02:45,090 --> 01:03:08,750
I feel like kind of suffocating needs to be a part of something else.

547
01:03:09,730 --> 01:03:58,770
So I think it's something that, you know, every time, you know, I think my Friday and I was like, upstairs and.

548
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:09,450
Yeah, right, right.

549
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:19,320
Yeah. That was the one I wanted to do.

550
01:04:24,090 --> 01:04:27,900
So I never got to do it. Just not going to do drop it.

551
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:39,350
I mean, it's almost astronomical.

552
01:04:39,420 --> 01:04:42,479
I don't think that was stated. Yeah. Yeah.

553
01:04:42,480 --> 01:05:00,000
I mean, I, I, I think what I don't understand how, you know, like, what's going on here.

554
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:12,210
I don't understand. This is even like in you're in the know is now like the only thing we're going to be able

555
01:05:13,190 --> 01:05:35,310
to get out of that you know actually anyway connected everything about health care.

556
01:05:36,670 --> 01:05:42,820
I mean, you know, everybody was like, that was one.

557
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:48,880
Yeah. Yeah, that's probably true.

558
01:05:48,910 --> 01:05:56,800
You know, you're like, all right. Well, we get started the a couple of microphones.

559
01:05:56,860 --> 01:06:01,269
We start over on this side of the room.

560
01:06:01,270 --> 01:06:06,970
Got a couple of one example from their group. Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

561
01:06:08,770 --> 01:06:17,470
Exactly right. Maybe you start. You know, you're going to start out we're going to start up here.

562
01:06:17,530 --> 01:06:20,850
You're going to see everything except for one thing.

563
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:26,800
I want you guys give us one example of how something on the left affects something on the right.

564
01:06:27,130 --> 01:06:35,000
Something that's just like, yeah, yeah.

565
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:52,520
Or energy saving your own. Oh, yeah, absolutely.

566
01:06:52,580 --> 01:06:57,500
Well said. Says system fragmentation and overuse. Yeah, that seemed to be a popular one.

567
01:06:57,500 --> 01:07:02,420
I think that is one of the ones that I think we've all probably experienced in some way, shape or form.

568
01:07:03,290 --> 01:07:12,310
So awesome. I grew up behind, you know, people's computer.

569
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:17,940
One of the things that was talked about was especially related to high cost efficiencies in

570
01:07:17,990 --> 01:07:23,900
system fragmentation with the payer model that we have and the systems that we've set up.

571
01:07:24,230 --> 01:07:28,460
And the patient experience becomes a lot more focused.

572
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:37,490
And so when you look at hospitals and clinics, they need to come in so that they can make their bottom line, they can make money.

573
01:07:37,940 --> 01:07:46,579
And a lot of that goes into patients being it's not only for internal reviews but also external like websites.

574
01:07:46,580 --> 01:07:50,030
You can just go on as a patient. That would be the hospital experience.

575
01:07:50,510 --> 01:07:56,610
So you put a lot of experience in clinical space and so you get those kinds of fears that can happen.

576
01:07:57,190 --> 01:08:01,430
Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Good stuff, mean.

577
01:08:07,980 --> 01:08:14,030
So yeah, we kind of did something similar. We talked about how systems are tracking patient by two or three.

578
01:08:14,550 --> 01:08:27,740
There are all kinds of the examples that were your process, for example, and some disconnect between different specialty physicians,

579
01:08:27,750 --> 01:08:40,920
kind of the effectiveness of care and you know, somebody you go through also situation, contract situation when that might not be necessary.

580
01:08:42,930 --> 01:08:49,680
And then that injury also affects patient experience throughout here.

581
01:08:52,620 --> 01:08:58,079
All right. In the back, we talk about very secure access and inequalities.

582
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:05,910
And for example, we talked about language barriers and how that could lower the effectiveness of care as well as patient experience.

583
01:09:06,780 --> 01:09:13,019
In this case, with language barriers, the patient may not be able to communicate their needs or get the help that they want,

584
01:09:13,020 --> 01:09:15,719
and they might feel stuck at that point,

585
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:25,050
which could lower the effectiveness as well as make them feel like, you know, they don't have the necessary tools to explain what they need.

586
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:33,059
And also, we talked about how with this language barrier, they might not be able to build a strong doctor patient relationship,

587
01:09:33,060 --> 01:09:41,790
which could also impact patient experience as well as the effectiveness of care, since the doctor may not know exactly what that patient needs.

588
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:48,180
And then because of all of this, it would definitely lower effectiveness and worsen patient care.

589
01:09:50,410 --> 01:09:53,970
Right. It would help to have things related to barriers.

590
01:09:53,980 --> 01:09:59,910
Just out of curiosity. I heard a couple munchkins touch on that one nice time and.

591
01:10:01,330 --> 01:10:06,340
So I don't know why I have to be in the time. So we talked about barriers to access,

592
01:10:07,150 --> 01:10:19,270
especially for people in rural areas and how it can affect population health because they may not have access to care that they need primary care.

593
01:10:19,270 --> 01:10:25,479
It can affect actually a lot of things. I think that's the first one that comes to mind is and I'm not sure how they measure it.

594
01:10:25,480 --> 01:10:33,730
We were we had a conversation about that. If they look at mortality rates or something in zip codes based on, you know,

595
01:10:33,790 --> 01:10:38,470
whatever proximity to a hospital or proximity to a clinic, that kind of thing.

596
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:42,610
Yeah, it's absolutely something that people look at a lot of distance, drive time,

597
01:10:42,610 --> 01:10:49,090
the nearest doctor's office, you know, insurance is obviously very tied to a lot of rurality as well.

598
01:10:49,180 --> 01:10:54,480
And various accesses also can be socio economic factors.

599
01:10:54,670 --> 01:10:59,770
People that, you know, have a car or maybe elderly and can't drive.

600
01:10:59,890 --> 01:11:04,240
Those kind of things all affect, you know, care.

601
01:11:04,330 --> 01:11:07,750
Yeah, absolutely. Great to get you guys back.

602
01:11:07,750 --> 01:11:11,860
Yeah. So like a lot of other groups, we talked about system fragmentation,

603
01:11:12,310 --> 01:11:18,400
but it was in the sense that it was beneficial for population health and our example,

604
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:24,040
which was vaccinations during flu season because this, for example,

605
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:29,860
pharmacies and grocery stores offer vaccinations, whereas they don't offer other medical services, obviously.

606
01:11:30,220 --> 01:11:34,240
And that could help population health because you can get vaccinated.

607
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:38,590
If somebody works two jobs and they take public transport to work every day,

608
01:11:39,070 --> 01:11:44,110
they might not be able to fit in a trip to the hospital or just to get a like a flu vaccine.

609
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:53,890
And they can just go to CBS or maybe I don't know Kroger does it but I grocery stores and they do it much more convenient.

610
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:05,430
Who's who's next? Next one? I'm here. We talk about barriers and population health and effectiveness of care.

611
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:09,000
But I'd actually like to put the question on its head if that's okay. Yeah.

612
01:12:10,110 --> 01:12:16,650
So one of the examples you mentioned on the effectiveness of care was HIV therapeutics, which is a great example.

613
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:20,990
But what I think is especially interesting about that is that HIV is one of

614
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:25,200
two diseases in this country that the federal government pays for all care.

615
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:31,080
The other being end stage renal disease. So why are HIV therapeutics so affected?

616
01:12:31,110 --> 01:12:35,910
Well, because anyone in this country with HIV can access those drugs for free.

617
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:46,020
No cost under the White Act. So we want to reduce barriers to care while increasing population, health and effectiveness of care.

618
01:12:46,410 --> 01:12:51,570
We have two really great examples of what the federal government could do if they chose to do so for other diseases.

619
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:57,530
Yeah, it's almost like it's an example of things to something that they can do.

620
01:12:57,540 --> 01:13:01,470
But right here.

621
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:19,450
So even so. But we connected barriers to care, access with openness of care, population health and provision of evidence based care.

622
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:21,370
So to focus on population health.

623
01:13:23,290 --> 01:13:30,250
If you have a significant portion of the population who is unable to access care, such as a lot of minority populations in this country,

624
01:13:30,490 --> 01:13:37,990
of course the population health is mostly positive because most of the population can access the legislation get.

625
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:42,270
Absolutely. All right.

626
01:13:42,510 --> 01:13:52,559
And then you go up side here. You know what it is to be somebody in the school system?

627
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:55,950
Family system? Yes, exactly.

628
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:04,950
You know, many times the person being asked because of the system fragmentation, they find something abnormal.

629
01:14:05,190 --> 01:14:11,310
They want to treat them like if they go to the Eden for some reason and become something else,

630
01:14:11,610 --> 01:14:18,179
they will learn and nobody will treat them and their parents to come back to somewhere else.

631
01:14:18,180 --> 01:14:25,150
And then all of this is done by the government agency so that you begin to then.

632
01:14:25,170 --> 01:14:34,300
Yes. The fragmentation of the. To tomorrow.

633
01:14:37,930 --> 01:14:42,220
We talk specifically about high costs for patients, especially those patients who are uninsured.

634
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:47,980
There are patients that is at risk if they can't get the treatment they need, and that also impacts their experience.

635
01:14:48,130 --> 01:14:54,610
If they go to their physician and they have a lot of issues that not obviously.

636
01:14:54,610 --> 01:14:57,640
And so that could reflect negatively on their providers.

637
01:14:58,110 --> 01:15:08,410
Yeah, it's certainly all tied together. Last but not least, so we talked about inequalities and population health,

638
01:15:08,980 --> 01:15:14,980
and so you have different groups of people that are not able to get the care that they

639
01:15:14,980 --> 01:15:22,840
need or socioeconomic status or the population as a whole are not able to get their care.

640
01:15:24,190 --> 01:15:28,509
Absolutely. Any other examples?

641
01:15:28,510 --> 01:15:35,120
I'm trying to think of ones that haven't really been touched on here, but any other last thoughts or comments?

642
01:15:36,680 --> 01:15:49,630
Yeah. Also in the group we talked about, we talked about inequalities and barriers to care leading to overuse in a sense,

643
01:15:50,050 --> 01:15:54,730
because you don't typically have regular access to care for them.

644
01:15:54,740 --> 01:15:58,750
Typically what you do is they usually like urgent care.

645
01:15:58,750 --> 01:16:04,020
In the emergency department, you're kind of going to want to demand more care and kind of think pressure.

646
01:16:04,390 --> 01:16:07,330
And to that department, it looks like overuse.

647
01:16:07,330 --> 01:16:12,640
But you've been underutilized for so long that you're really just trying to make sure that they're right.

648
01:16:13,210 --> 01:16:16,150
Yeah. No, it's it's absolutely I mean, we talk about system fragmentation,

649
01:16:16,150 --> 01:16:23,860
but there's also the care coordination of patient level where someone that has very fragmented care on their own,

650
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:32,200
they're going to be getting a lot else. They're going to be able to access emergency services or whatever the case may be because of that.

651
01:16:32,350 --> 01:16:37,630
So it's a great example. Handles Well, thanks, everyone.

652
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:45,430
Is there any other thoughts, questions, concerns, great planning against or size.

653
01:16:45,470 --> 01:16:53,550
Make sure to turn in your questions. Let us know and we'll be getting the Qualtrics survey around for the good projects and all of that.

654
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:57,280
We will see you all and every office hours here from that list.

655
01:16:58,180 --> 01:17:07,150
So if you have questions or much about anything that might arise and then bring your credit cards back down here,

656
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:21,768
I can't do this on Thursday because right now I have.
