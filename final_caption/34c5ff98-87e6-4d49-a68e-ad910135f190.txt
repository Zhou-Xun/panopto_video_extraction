00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:03,310
In this video,

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:13,840
I want to talk about a type of disaster communication that is a core staple of public health communications in the context of natural disasters,

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:21,310
but is actually a really complicated type of communication. And in order to understand how to accomplish its goals,

4
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:28,540
we really need to dive pretty deeply into the multiple different audiences that need to be reached when the situation occurs.

5
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:34,930
What am I talking about? Evacuation orders, like something that might happen when you have a big hurricane,

6
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:39,820
something that might happen when there is an outbreak of disease in a particular community.

7
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:48,910
And you need to isolate particular people, any kind of toxic spill, any kind of situation in which there's a public health emergency.

8
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:57,140
And the core message is that people need to evacuate a location for their own safety.

9
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:07,190
Now, if we talk about hurricane evacuation order coming from the public health agencies, coming from the Weather Service, who is the target audience?

10
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:09,920
Right, what are their salient characteristics?

11
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:18,140
Well, the obvious first salient characteristic is that they live or work in a very specific target location.

12
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:26,570
And we need to figure out how do you communicate to people who are in that location and associated with that?

13
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:32,930
How do you make sure that people can distinguish whether they are in the evacuation space or not?

14
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:43,110
Right. If it's just everybody should evacuate, that leads to chaos, but it needs to be very clear who falls into the order and who doesn't.

15
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:47,670
Now, what's the context in which they're going to receive this kind of an order?

16
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:50,820
Well, there's actually two different kinds of situations.

17
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:59,350
One is the one that's usually hopefully in the modern era, what happens with hurricanes like we know the hurricanes coming.

18
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:04,600
So there is some anticipation, there's some awareness that there might be a threat,

19
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,380
maybe we don't know if it's going to hit us or if it's going to hit somebody else.

20
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:17,500
But the context is a background level of awareness of the need to monitor the safety of what's around it.

21
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:26,560
But on the other hand, we might think about other kinds of disasters, let's say a toxic chemical spill or nuclear reactor accident.

22
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:32,950
Right. Those are things that which are surprises. So the context there is that people are going through going about their day.

23
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:38,530
They are completely not paying attention to whatever it is this risk is.

24
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:45,220
And then now it is the responsibility of the public health agency to divert their attention from what they

25
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:51,630
were already doing and make them care about this because they are at risk and they need to know that.

26
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:58,540
Now, third question, third question, third question is why should the audience care about this?

27
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:03,130
Well, in one sense, it seems obvious, right, for their own safety, but of course,

28
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:07,990
the problem there is people don't just care about their own safety, they care about their property.

29
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:12,940
They care about their jobs. They care about their loved ones who may not be able to go anywhere.

30
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:16,510
And so that then becomes the challenge.

31
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:24,730
How do we think about messaging in a context in which the message is something that somebody might care about for their own safety,

32
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:29,860
but they may also care about other things and they may not care to hear that they have to abandon their house,

33
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:33,870
but they have to leave their job, et cetera.

34
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:43,530
Now, public health agencies, in one hand, it seems fairly obvious what's the goal of the communication to get people to leave.

35
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,540
But now I want to go back for a second,

36
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:55,230
because the salient characteristics of the audience more generally is this idea of anybody who lives in a particular location, those who are at risk.

37
00:03:55,230 --> 00:04:03,870
But if we're being good public health communicators and the core message of our communication is that people need to evacuate,

38
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:18,500
we need to break our audience down into different subgroups. One subgroup is the people who have the resources and ability to be mobile, right.

39
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:23,820
People who have cars, who have the money to be able to buy the gas,

40
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:30,180
to be able to drive to a different location, to do the things that are involved in evacuating.

41
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:39,390
If you have that money, if you are privileged and have the opportunity, then the order to evacuate has a very specific meaning to you.

42
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:48,140
Like take your car, take your resources, use those to accomplish this goal of evacuating the location.

43
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:56,030
But notice, we live in a world right now in which you cannot assume that everyone has access to good independent transportation.

44
00:04:56,030 --> 00:05:05,240
We certainly cannot assume that everyone in a community has the resources to be able to stay in a hotel for many years or many years,

45
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:13,130
but for many weeks, let's say, after a major disaster, we certainly cannot assume that people have places to go.

46
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:20,510
Right. The disparities that exist within our society means that another salient characteristic of at least

47
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:26,810
a subset of our audience is these are people who now are aware that if they stay where they are,

48
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:31,570
they are at risk. But they don't know how to leave.

49
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:35,160
They may lack the ability to leave.

50
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:43,890
So what are they supposed to do, and this is one of the big problems that has happened repeatedly in the context of public health evacuation orders,

51
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:48,030
is that the orders in some sense are written for the more affluent.

52
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:57,960
They're written. They're talked about, oh, assuming that somebody will be able to get a car or get a ride with somebody else and be able to evacuate.

53
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:06,540
Who is left, those who don't have those resources and they cannot comply, even if they want to comply?

54
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:09,390
So the problem with the evacuation order is,

55
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:17,850
is it doesn't have enough information to speak to all of the relevant audiences, it speaks to those who have cars.

56
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:28,020
It doesn't speak to those who may need public transportation or have physical limitations that would inhibit their ability to move or medical needs,

57
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:33,860
for example, that would inhibit their ability to leave. What are they supposed to do?

58
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:41,840
And once we understand that those barriers to not just accepting the communication, but being able to act on them,

59
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:51,170
we recognize that a hurricane evacuation order is frankly incomplete because it cannot speak to all the needs of its different audiences.

60
00:06:51,170 --> 00:07:04,260
A good hurricane evacuation order has to both say if you have the opportunity to evacuate, do so now and to provide instructions.

61
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:09,900
Motivation and answers for those people who may face barriers to leave it right.

62
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:18,390
So if it's if you cannot leave, then where should you go or how can you call to get help to be evacuated, et cetera?

63
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:24,600
Right. Only by being clear about the needs of that other population.

64
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:31,680
Can we hope to possibly provide a message that is actually actionable by all the different people who are going to be affected by,

65
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,880
let's say, this hurricane in a particular community.

66
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:42,320
So this is what we mean when we talk about really understanding your audiences, plural, it's not just one audience.

67
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:50,520
You have to break it down. And when you do break it down, you start to recognize that a communication that might make a lot of sense.

68
00:07:50,520 --> 00:08:00,300
To somebody who can pile up the suitcases and put all their stuff in the back of their their truck or their car and drive 500 miles to,

69
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:05,380
let's say, go visit family is in a very different situation.

70
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:15,060
Then a message that has to speak to and inform and hopefully help someone who.

71
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:18,810
May live in a location in which there is poor public transportation,

72
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:31,230
may not have any independent car and may have no resources to use to spend to be able to buy their way into transportation away from that danger zone.

73
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:40,410
It is this kind of problem, this disparity in the impact of our communications, which unfortunately has in US history and in many other countries,

74
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:49,530
led to very systemic disparities in the outcomes of crisis situations because the communications have often

75
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:56,010
assumed a degree of agency that isn't necessarily there for all of the people that it's trying to communicate to.

76
00:08:56,010 --> 00:09:00,210
So this is another example where diving deep into the audience,

77
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:07,470
their characteristics and the specific barriers that they may face in acting on the communication can highlight

78
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:17,120
ways in which either the communication is incomplete or it needs to be tailored to meet each audiences goals.
