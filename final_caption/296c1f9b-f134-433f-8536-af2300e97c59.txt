1
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:11,700
Hello. Good morning.

2
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:17,090
It's Monday again. It's a little colder. I hope that you had a nice weekend.

3
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:21,620
And today we've got kind of a slightly relaxing class, actually.

4
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,600
We're going to talk about policy memos.

5
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:30,710
So there's a bit of me talking and a bit of us collectively as a group evaluating some different kinds of policy memos.

6
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:36,440
And today, so today's course is nice and straightforward in that way.

7
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:42,860
One of the reasons why we're trying to focus on policy memos and have such a boring title for the class,

8
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:50,770
which is how to write a policy memo, is really because this is a very useful skill in lots of different contexts.

9
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:57,950
So I'll talk a bit about what a policy memo is in the world of policy advocacy.

10
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:04,260
But please take this away as something that you can use in lots of different contexts.

11
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:04,850
I have.

12
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:14,780
Students tell me that they use this to write memos for like boards of directors or organizational leadership or I know community based things too.

13
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:21,470
So it is quite helpful in lots of different ways, and it is all about writing and communication.

14
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:24,799
So by assigning policy memos in this class,

15
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:34,010
what we're trying to do is give you a format and some experience of writing briefly and persuasively on a policy issue,

16
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:38,040
which people always assume that these things are really easy.

17
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:42,140
So if you looked at this assignment and you were like, This is pretty easy, I think it would be fine.

18
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:48,980
It's actually quite a hard assignment. It's quite difficult to do well. It's a little bit harder for sure than the first one that you did.

19
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:58,070
That's why we're going to give you this intro. Has anybody in this class written something like a policy memo or a one pager before?

20
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:02,820
Few people. Great. Do you want to share your experience of doing that?

21
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:09,709
What was easy and what was hard for ten to begin? There's a little cluster of folks over there.

22
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:13,520
And then there's some people over there, too, I think. Right. So what was that like?

23
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:18,109
Tell me what policy memo you wrote and how it was. Yeah, we actually did it together.

24
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:23,060
Was it the I think it like a oh, yeah.

25
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:27,320
Anti conversion therapy laws for LGBTQ youth.

26
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:36,140
And one thing I remember being difficult was being like brief and concise because you only have one page or two.

27
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:40,460
This is very true. I struggle with this myself. So I spent.

28
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:54,160
So I want to say a year and a half, nearly two years, writing policy memos for the government around the pandemic, which was pretty tough.

29
00:02:54,550 --> 00:03:03,280
And I would get a phone call from our partners that we were working with in the Army Corps like nine in the morning.

30
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:07,839
And then they would say, Can you please write me this memo by 12?

31
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,860
I need to submit it to this person at FEMA. And I'd say, okay.

32
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:20,620
And then I'd have a small panic attack quietly in my office. And the most difficult part for me was always writing briefly,

33
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:28,370
like trying to encapsulate everything as succinctly as possible and also maybe targeting it to my audience.

34
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:34,090
I found that hard, too, especially as I discovered over time that the audiences I was writing for.

35
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:41,739
I'm writing a lot of policy briefs, explaining the situation in different countries around the world, and that's kind of why they hired me.

36
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:47,260
They wanted me to, like, provide international context for some specific countries.

37
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:54,940
And you would be surprised how much these some of these policymakers do not know about some of the countries that they really,

38
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:59,560
really can affect with their decisions. So that was also a bit of a challenge.

39
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:05,100
Who else wrote a policy memo? There were some. Yeah, tell me about that.

40
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:08,340
How was it for you? Sorry. It's going to go. You had to go.

41
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:16,120
I wrote a policy memo about extending the special enrollment period for Idaho's state health care marketplace.

42
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,790
And I wrote it to the governor of Idaho.

43
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:27,400
And I think one difficult part was like coming from not having any knowledge of Idaho and supposedly writing to the governor of Idaho.

44
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:30,090
You have to do a lot of background research to make sure,

45
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:35,080
like the level of information you're presenting is appropriate for the person you're writing it to write.

46
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:38,980
What do you tell the governor of Idaho about Idaho? It's quite difficult, yeah.

47
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:46,960
Yeah. So it was a lot of research and the writing definitely took less time than you think it does, but the research takes a lot of time.

48
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:52,330
Yeah. So I was just saying to Jana before class, we're asking you.

49
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,270
Thank you. The reason why this can be a tricky,

50
00:04:55,540 --> 00:05:02,080
tricky endeavor is we're asking you to do like ten pages amount of research and then put the writing into, like, two pages.

51
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:06,879
So nice and simple. Who else wrote a policy memo? I think there was some other people.

52
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,940
I didn't. Didn't see. Yep.

53
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:16,870
So what did you like about it? And what was hard? Yes.

54
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:24,730
So I wrote like an internal memo. And what I found difficult was you had to have all the information, like again in a succinct way.

55
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,790
But then you also had to get it approved by so many different people. And everybody had like their own take on something.

56
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:34,660
And like, even, like the most minute thing that you would write would get criticized.

57
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:39,370
So yeah, just making sure that it is appealing to a very educated audience.

58
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:42,940
Yeah, absolutely. And especially. Thank you.

59
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:46,870
And some of these policy areas are so jargon heavy, too.

60
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:50,620
I would get criticized for using certain words and they didn't, but they didn't like.

61
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:54,100
And I was like, Oh, that's very much a mainstream public health term.

62
00:05:54,430 --> 00:06:00,580
But everybody in public health agrees on. But apparently you in whichever agency, you don't like that so much.

63
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:04,780
So it was a lot of adjusting a little bit again to your audience.

64
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:10,719
So that's definitely a big part of it, is trying to figure out your audience and what they would like,

65
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:17,080
in part because in your case you had to get it approved by 90 different people before it could be finalized,

66
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,980
which is can be frustrating, I think, too. All right.

67
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,940
So. Very simple class.

68
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:30,790
We're going to talk about how to write policy memos. And if you haven't written a policy memo before, don't worry.

69
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:34,299
It's not essential for attempting to do it now.

70
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:38,110
I think you're all in a good place in terms of your understanding of the issues and

71
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:44,349
evidence and writing skills so policy memos can be used for different purposes.

72
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:50,380
So when we're talking about a memo, we're actually describing a whole bunch of different kinds of documents.

73
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:56,590
They are short, they are supposed to be informative, and some of them are also argumentative, too.

74
00:06:56,590 --> 00:07:05,800
So in this class specifically, we're forcing you somewhat arbitrarily into a format that we want you to follow.

75
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:13,300
We're not saying this is the only way to write a policy memo or even that it's the best possible way to write a policy memo,

76
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:17,260
because I don't think that such a thing exists in a uniform way.

77
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:26,320
What we're trying to do for pedagogy sake is have you look at the evidence, produce an argument that's persuasive, clear, nice writing.

78
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:30,910
And we'll talk a bit more about what we're looking for specifically in this class.

79
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:35,590
But let's keep keep going on about the general characteristics of this kind of

80
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:39,970
document so they can be descriptive or they can argue for a policy position.

81
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:47,440
They get called different things like policy briefs. Sometimes they're called a one pager, even if they're not one page.

82
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:56,950
Just to confuse you, a one pager is a even more concise version of the argument when it comes to the policy challenge packet.

83
00:07:56,950 --> 00:08:00,280
At the end of the class, we are going to ask you to write a one pager.

84
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:05,290
So that is kind of important to know that it's just an even shorter version.

85
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:09,880
So we're going to look at some one pages today and give them a bit of a critique.

86
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:14,810
I want you to remember through all of this that you can write the best.

87
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:19,570
Possible policy memo. It can be an absolute work of art.

88
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:26,440
It can be graphically amazing. It can be written so persuasively and clearly it can produce the best evidence.

89
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:33,040
And that might not make one bit of difference in whether or not you actually get the change that you're seeking.

90
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:37,660
Right. There are other factors that go beyond policy memos.

91
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:44,620
You're not going to magically, you know, magic some of those barriers to change away by writing a policy memo.

92
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:53,690
However, what we do want you to take from this is that clear and precise and persuasive communication can be a really important and useful tool.

93
00:08:54,970 --> 00:09:00,879
But I think sometimes some programs really fetishize the writing of a policy memo so much

94
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:06,040
that students come away thinking that if I can just engineer the best possible policy memo,

95
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:16,150
everything else will fall into place. I don't want you to think that. So we talked about what a one pager is, and we'll look at some examples.

96
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:20,260
And when should you use a policy memo?

97
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:25,880
Well, you might want to provide support to somebody that you work with in whatever context.

98
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:35,710
Or members of the public, even when you're describing the situation in a policy area, or you might want to be argumentative and persuade somebody.

99
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:41,430
We we're asking you to do the latter because it's a little bit more difficult and I think sometimes more useful.

100
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:48,550
So they are trying to get a good balance between the evidence that you are using to support your case.

101
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:56,140
And because we're asking you to write something in an academic context, we are asking for citations and that kind of thing.

102
00:09:56,710 --> 00:10:00,760
Policy memos don't always have citations, but we're asking you to put those in.

103
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:08,559
And we really, in this case, asking you to persuade somebody to take a clearly defined action.

104
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:14,920
You want to see action? It's going to be related to one of the policy areas that you've already studied in the class.

105
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,360
So hopefully that will help you.

106
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:28,420
But we think it is a probably the most useful form of a policy memo is to do something argumentative for for efficacy sake.

107
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:32,970
So. Who reads these policy memos. This is really important.

108
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:35,999
People who wrote policy memos, who were your audience?

109
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:45,030
I think I heard a little bit about were they were they specialists or were they generally interested in the topic even?

110
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:48,870
Probably not. So when you're writing for your audience,

111
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:56,190
you've got to get out of the mindset that the person knows just as much as you do about the policy that you've just researched.

112
00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:01,760
They might not. They might be perfectly capable of understanding the same things that you are trying to explain.

113
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:08,170
So it's not that they're not generally educated or interested in the topic.

114
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:12,960
It's just that they might not have a lot of specialist knowledge. That might not be the focus of their work.

115
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:16,470
So it's good to know that about your audience, right?

116
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:23,250
What did they think about this policy area, if at all, especially if you're writing to legislators?

117
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:27,690
They might have a staff person who is engaged on this policy, but they might not.

118
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:38,070
So that it's important to note that a lot of the time they don't have a lot of spare time to sit around and educate themselves about this issue.

119
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:45,330
In fact, the people who are reading your policy memos quite often are fairly low level people in entry level jobs.

120
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:50,159
They are scanning this thing quickly. Especially in legislative context.

121
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,780
It's probably an intern and also regulatory context.

122
00:11:54,780 --> 00:12:00,929
The people who get the jobs of scanning and reading all of those different inputs to

123
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:05,430
public comment opportunities where people comment on regulations that are forthcoming.

124
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:12,800
Quite often the people at the lowest rung of the ladder and they don't have a lot of time to spend on your piece particularly.

125
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:21,060
So just keep in mind you're writing for somebody who is time pressured, who doesn't necessarily have specialist knowledge about this subject area.

126
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:27,900
So some important implications of that are make sure you avoid jargon and acronyms.

127
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:37,920
Make sure you spell out what you're saying in that way. And I would say try to anticipate the questions that they might have.

128
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:41,670
So I'm going to say this multiple times during this course.

129
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:48,150
Editing is your friend, so edit with the audience in mind, think about how they might receive what you've written.

130
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:53,850
Think about if there's a way to communicate any of it slightly more clearly to that audience,

131
00:12:53,850 --> 00:13:01,500
knowing who they are, how much time they have, how much expertize in or interest they have in the topic.

132
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:06,450
Right. So bearing all that in mind and keeping that in mind when you're writing is a good idea.

133
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:10,890
So. Any more questions?

134
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:16,110
Well, any questions about just the very basics of what a policy memo is when it gets used?

135
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:21,850
Anything I said that didn't make sense. Okay.

136
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:26,610
Good. So. For this class.

137
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:31,400
As I said, policy memos come in different formats, but we're asking you for a specific format.

138
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:36,170
There is a example memo on the website by the assignment.

139
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:40,710
I absolutely recommend that you start there. Read that carefully.

140
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:46,620
I'm going to show you the format again in a minute on the site. So it will also be discussed in this class.

141
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:56,460
And we think that this is a useful way to practice some transferable skills around argumentation and writing.

142
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:00,680
I will linger on this point for a moment. So.

143
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:05,530
Targeting is one of the most important parts of this memo.

144
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:14,499
It's a little bit sneaky in this assignment because we were asking you to go to start with the policy area

145
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:20,350
that you previously wrote about for your strategic policy analysis paper that you just wrote last week.

146
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:23,709
We're asking you to stick with that topic for the most part.

147
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:29,530
Although if you really, really want a change and you don't mind doing a bit of extra background research, that's fine.

148
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,760
Just trying to make it a bit easier on you by having you double up on the topic.

149
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:41,560
And we're asking you then to write a memo that is targeted at a specific person and asking them to take a specific action.

150
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:46,740
That means you do have to know something about the political system.

151
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:49,690
So it goes back to what we discussed around American government.

152
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:59,170
And I would say the easiest way to do this, if you're a little unsure about how to target your memo, is pick a legislator.

153
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:04,120
I would pick a legislator likely to be a champion on your issue and a bit of

154
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:09,460
legislation that's been considered or could be considered in a particular context.

155
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:14,950
Pick a context that, you know, it could be federal, but it could be state also.

156
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:21,730
If it is if you are looking at state policies, pick a state that, you know, don't make this harder on yourselves than you have to.

157
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:28,210
And from that, think about who could be a champion in that legislature.

158
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:37,310
Now that doesn't necessarily apply for everybody. So there are some other contexts in which you might want to write to somebody in the bureaucracy.

159
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:39,620
You might want to write to the governor's office.

160
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:47,450
You might want to write to somebody else who is in a position of power, let's say, around prisons or schools.

161
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:53,780
That's quite most often the policy areas where there's a little bit more ambiguity about who is making the decisions.

162
00:15:54,260 --> 00:16:00,710
Well, you absolutely do not want to do is write to somebody who doesn't have the ability to take that action.

163
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:11,690
That is an absolute problem. So that's not to say that in a lot of general contexts you won't write these kinds of things for a more general audience,

164
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:17,210
for other people in your coalition, for other people in your community, for members of the public more generally.

165
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:23,060
This does come these kinds of policy memos do come in useful in all those different contexts.

166
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,129
But for the purposes of this class,

167
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:32,690
we want you to pick a decision maker and make sure that you pick one that actually has the authority to take that decision.

168
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:38,420
If you're not sure, come and ask us. Like that's why we hold office hours.

169
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:44,870
Students quite often struggle with this aspect of the assignment. That's why I'm going on about.

170
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:48,440
It's quite so much an emphasis in this aspect of targeting.

171
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:54,630
Okay. Any questions about that at all?

172
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,220
No. Okay. Well, do come and see us if you.

173
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:06,680
Get into this and you get a little bit stuck because that's what we're here for.

174
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:15,280
It's not cheating to come and ask for our help. So this is the structure that we would use for policy in this class.

175
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:21,730
Like I said, if you look at policymakers in the wild, in the real world, there's lots of different ways to do this.

176
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:26,790
And we're not necessarily advocating for any one way, but this will work for this assignment.

177
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:30,340
And it's a useful, useful structure, I think. So.

178
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,530
We're really asking you. I'm belaboring the point. I know.

179
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:41,190
I'm sorry. We're asking for a named person with the authority to act on your request to actually do something about this problem.

180
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:49,940
You can put your name, you can make up a name. You can pick a group, interest group to represent if you if you would like, if you enjoy role playing.

181
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:58,410
And this makes it more fun for you. Sure. And then the most important is in the executive summary,

182
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:08,520
you're really trying to get as much information as possible into that first bit around what is the problem that you want to be addressed?

183
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:13,500
Why is it addressing it important and what should be done about it?

184
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:22,530
The idea here is that somebody who's time pressured can scan the beginning of this memo and know very quickly by reading one paragraph.

185
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:28,520
What is the problem here? What is the target? Why is this an important problem and why?

186
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:35,460
What should be done without having to read the rest of the memo? Because sadly, even though we put all this effort into writing these memos,

187
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:39,180
I don't know if these generals in the Army read all the way through my memos.

188
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:43,650
I don't know if the White House equity task force read through all my memos.

189
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:48,389
You know, it's one of these things where you get a little bit of feedback later on saying, oh,

190
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:54,540
this was quite useful, but you never know on the day how much attention has actually been paid to that piece.

191
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:59,220
So. The second section is about background.

192
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:06,999
What the trap here is that we're asking you to write a limited memo of two pages.

193
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,210
And we really, really, really discourage going over two pages.

194
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:15,790
Where people fall over sometimes is that they get way into the policy, which is great,

195
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:21,430
which we love, but they feel the urge to put all that research in a big background section.

196
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:27,770
That's a big problem. I would pay special attention to editing the length of that section.

197
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:34,960
Because I'm saying provide essential information that helps that person you're writing to understand the problem,

198
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:42,190
understand why you think this is an important problem. So you can stick some descriptive statistics in there if you like.

199
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:51,820
You can use some citations to back up your argument. But it's got to be not everything I learned about this topic in a paragraph because it's

200
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:55,480
going to be a very long paragraph and you use up most of the first page doing this.

201
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:03,220
And that's not an effective way to write a memo, just enough for anybody to understand the issue at stake.

202
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:08,200
Okay. Then we want to reject the status quo.

203
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:13,110
So we've had you write about the status quo in the prior assignment, right?

204
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,150
So you you have some idea about how to do this.

205
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:20,170
What's the current situation and why is it not good enough?

206
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:26,019
What is what is happening in terms of health outcomes, what's happening in terms of inequalities,

207
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:34,270
what is happening in terms of a lack of justice or however you want to frame the problem appropriately according to your policy, what's the issue?

208
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:39,760
And then you're going to make a recommendation to take an action to address that problem.

209
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:46,120
Okay. And then this is more of a pedagogical part.

210
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:49,080
You don't always have counterarguments in a policy memo.

211
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:59,520
But we think it's really helpful if we ask you guys to think through, well, what would somebody say to against the recommendation that you're making?

212
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:07,680
If you want to take action to ban semiautomatic weapons or something, what would somebody say?

213
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:11,820
Who wants to defend the ability to purchase those weapons?

214
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,560
Right. So anticipate some counterarguments.

215
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:24,599
Doesn't need to be. Too many one or two that seem to make sense and explain why you're right.

216
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:28,050
And that other person who would be countering your argument is wrong.

217
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:34,020
Okay, we're doing that kind of as a way to test whether you can think through this argument

218
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:38,580
from a political perspective and understand what your opponents might think.

219
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:47,580
Even if you don't agree with them, there's no need to agree with anything that's being said, and they might not.

220
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:52,670
I've said opponents. It might just be somebody else who wants to take a weaker form of the action.

221
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:56,850
It might be somebody else who recommends a different way of tackling the problem

222
00:21:56,850 --> 00:22:01,469
because they might think that that's what you're saying is too recommending,

223
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:05,780
is too expensive, or you what you're saying won't be effective.

224
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:11,900
Right. You have to justify why you think this is going to be an effective way of of

225
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:15,720
addressing the problem against some potential other ways to address the problem.

226
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,370
In the conclusion we really think you should. Repeat the call to action.

227
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:30,450
Make it clear why somebody should be taking that action and why it's really important in the real world.

228
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:36,840
And then bibliography at the end. That doesn't count in the two page limit, obviously.

229
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:43,890
Otherwise that would be a little bit crazy. So any questions about this?

230
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:48,150
This really is the boring part, the class. So we have to make sure everybody understands the assignment.

231
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:54,470
Please. Thank you.

232
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:01,989
I was wondering, I know in the last assignment, like it said, double spaced, but we did single spaced.

233
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:08,650
Like what's the actual like format, how it's going to look on the page or is that kind of up to us?

234
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:13,820
That is my fault because I did the template after I did the instructions and then I forgot to change the text.

235
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:18,729
I don't know. I would check. Let's check and see whatever canvas says.

236
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:26,230
Janna, would you mind doing that for me for a sec? Because I would go whatever with with whatever canvas says.

237
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:30,670
The example should be in the same format, although it is from a different class.

238
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:35,920
Is double spaced with examples of. Basically that was the point.

239
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:39,880
That was for the last one. Is it for this one as well? Yeah.

240
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:49,870
I tell you something, I had four people proofread this entire canvas schools and the syllabus, and it's still mistakes.

241
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,910
So I'm sorry. We should go with whatever canvas says.

242
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,030
I will review it and I will make a little announcement that makes it clear to everyone.

243
00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:01,710
All right. Any of the questions? Yes.

244
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:13,840
Thank you. Okay, so I might have totally missed this, but for the target person, would you recommend for this assignment?

245
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,890
Like having your target person be someone who's in support of whatever you're.

246
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:24,970
Yes. Getting past doesn't have to be. I mean, you could try persuading someone who has a very different view.

247
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:34,030
But I would say if you're going to do advocacy, it's most likely that you'll start with trying to recruit a champion, a supporter, somebody.

248
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:41,320
So, for example, if I was looking at legislators, I would that's a little easier because you could look at their record,

249
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:47,650
see what they've said in the past, see how they voted, and then you can pick somebody who has the ability to make a difference.

250
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:50,680
You might want to pick somebody who's on a committee.

251
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:56,980
If you're asking them in particular to push this legislation forward, that might make a lot of sense.

252
00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:04,840
Right, for other individuals that are not necessarily as on the public record as much as legislators.

253
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:08,559
You might have to just make an educated guess. Don't worry.

254
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:11,110
We don't expect you to be be wizards here,

255
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:18,400
but make a good guess around somebody who you think is likely to be able to be pushed in the direction that you want to see.

256
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:27,520
Right. It can be it's a bit disheartening and can be a complete waste of time to go and try to persuade somebody who's very opposed.

257
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:36,070
The most likely to not even read your memo, frankly, is a bit sad, but it's kind of the political environment that we're in.

258
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:39,950
Any other questions? Okay.

259
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:45,650
Good. So.

260
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:53,899
Thank goodness for that. That's the. Most intensive assignment.

261
00:25:53,900 --> 00:26:00,410
Intensive part of the class done. So what are some things to watch out for more generally when you're writing policy memos?

262
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:05,750
I've already said select the correct target. Don't ask somebody to do something that they can't do.

263
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:14,179
Otherwise, you just wasted your time. And in advocacy, you only have so much energy and time and resources to devote to something.

264
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:18,920
So you've got to really think this through. And knowing your audience is really important.

265
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:27,290
Another thing that students quite often struggle with a bit when they're learning to do this is the tone of your writing.

266
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:39,139
So there are some times where a very informal tone might be really appropriate if you are writing to a bunch of people

267
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:45,260
who you already work with in coalition and you're trying to use language that they would use that you all use together,

268
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:50,090
I think that might make sense. But those examples are relatively infrequent.

269
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,549
For the most part, it's not.

270
00:26:52,550 --> 00:27:03,810
It's good to keep the tone fairly neutral and professional and don't stray too far into using a bunch of jargon and complicated language.

271
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:10,760
I think sometimes students feel like if I just put more statistics in this paragraph and more citations,

272
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:16,130
and then I'll sound very knowledgeable and I'll know what I'm talking about, and that will be incredibly convincing.

273
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:19,759
You know, more technical is not necessarily more convincing.

274
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:23,840
And I think that's something you have to unlearn a bit from maybe some other assignments.

275
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:29,510
At the same time, don't use a really familiar tone.

276
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,620
If you're writing to somebody you don't know, like a legislator or a governor,

277
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:38,750
that you wouldn't write to the governor of Idaho and say, Hey, mate, how you doing?

278
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:48,890
I'm making this up. But I get occasionally some folks who will write a really informal tone and they'll kind of go very far into.

279
00:27:49,820 --> 00:28:03,140
But political rhetoric in the sense of exaggerating very strongly all the political problems and difficulties doing that too much can be.

280
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:09,800
Can actually be negative and prevent somebody from reading your memo fully.

281
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:18,530
Right. Don't under don't underestimate the seriousness of the problems that you're tackling, because some of these problems are really serious.

282
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:24,530
Well, they all are. But at the same time, try to use relatively.

283
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:29,200
Not neutral language because that's not quite the right way of putting it.

284
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:36,990
But don't go overboard and like fall into an informal tone because your that

285
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:43,150
is very emotional and very much trying to evoke emotion in the other person.

286
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:47,970
If you don't think that will respond to that emotional response.

287
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:54,160
Right. There might be some audiences that would respond very well to using emotional language or evoking imagery,

288
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:59,020
and then the other audiences that will not respond to that and will be turned off by it.

289
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:02,350
So it's about knowing your audience and trying to match the tone.

290
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:07,840
And that's, I think, one of the more difficult things to get right in this kind of writing.

291
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:11,930
I've already said limit the background to the essentials, provide some evidence.

292
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:21,220
You don't need graphics. This isn't a graphic design class in any way, so feel free to ignore that if you.

293
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:29,620
I would say the one thing to pay attention to is sometimes students really get into trouble with the editing and so they

294
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:34,870
try and squeeze everything in on one page and then there's no whitespace on the page and I can't read it very easily.

295
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:39,910
That's not a good thing to do. You do want to pay attention to readability.

296
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:46,060
Somebody should be able to pick this up. It should be accessible very quickly and you should be able to read through very easily.

297
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:49,990
If you cram a lot of text into the page. It's a little less easy to read.

298
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:56,140
So like, don't scale down the font size and stuff just to fit in a few sentences.

299
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:59,680
We've all done it. Don't do it. It doesn't help you in the end.

300
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:02,920
Instead, I would say spend loads of time editing.

301
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:07,390
When you approach this assignment, please don't write it in one day.

302
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:14,300
Please give it a go. Take the first draft, let it rest and edit it again.

303
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,840
I say you would probably need to edit this three times to do it right.

304
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:25,879
Okay. So when you're budgeting like I think somebody mentioned the writing is actually not as hard as you think.

305
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:31,040
It's not. Doesn't take as long as you think. But the editing, however, can take quite a bit longer.

306
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:35,930
So my recommendation is research fairly quickly,

307
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:39,950
which we should have hopefully given you a head start on because you did your

308
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:44,120
first assignment on the same topic that you will mostly be covering for this.

309
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:49,400
Then do the writing as briefly as you can for the first draft.

310
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:54,020
I would just sit there and bash it out. Give yourself a timer. If you like writing to a timer,

311
00:30:54,410 --> 00:31:00,260
give yourself a limited amount of time to just get some thoughts on the page and don't judge watch there the first time.

312
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:03,830
That's what I'll always do is like, write quickly, get it out.

313
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:07,160
Then I will separate myself from it from a little bit.

314
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:13,190
Go do something else and I'll come back to it and then I'll edit it and then I'll try to be self-critical

315
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:19,340
and make sure that I'm actually writing for that other person rather than writing what I want to write.

316
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:25,679
Okay. That is my most important thing that I wish all students would do when approaching this,

317
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:31,560
not just in the assignment, but in the real world, is please edit your work because sometimes people don't.

318
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:39,150
And I realize there's a ton of time pressures on everyone, but I would say to avoid that, write this in short little bursts.

319
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:47,190
Any questions about anything? I sit there. Okay.

320
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:54,860
All right. Now the fun part. So we are going to look together at some different policy memos.

321
00:31:55,520 --> 00:32:03,190
I'm going to have open some up. And I think I'm going to start with this top one, by the way.

322
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:07,749
It's just an HPI guide. It's really written by Eileen Costa.

323
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:15,160
Nikki, who is the HPI is the Institute for Health Care Policy and Innovation at the University of Michigan.

324
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:21,700
It's kind of an interesting think tank that's internal and research shop that's internal to the university.

325
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:26,710
And Eileen Costa, Nikki works for them and she is a full time advocate and lobbyist.

326
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:32,110
So, you know, I trust her more than I trust me when I'm asking people to write policy memos.

327
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:35,290
She has some great advice. I want to start with this one.

328
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:44,070
And I think what we're going to do is. Discuss these in.

329
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:52,000
Discuss these in pairs. So if you have the slides open, feel free.

330
00:32:52,930 --> 00:33:01,400
To crack this link. It is from the National Association of Regional Councils.

331
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:06,640
Doesn't that sound exciting? They have a lot of really interesting policy briefs.

332
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:11,680
This one they describe as a one pager, even though it's two pages.

333
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:15,500
Please note that I want you to have a look at this, a quick read.

334
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:19,780
I'm only going to give you a short time to read it because we're dealing with time pressure.

335
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:27,280
Let's take a look at this for a couple of minutes in pairs or threes or little groups, whatever suits you.

336
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:31,240
And I want you to judge this. I want you to give it a great.

337
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:36,850
How good a policy memo do you think this is? Does it communicate clearly about the policy area?

338
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,530
Does it ask for action in a inappropriate way?

339
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:47,560
What would you change about this memo if you had the chance?

340
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:53,390
If you were. If I asked you to write a similar thing on affordable housing.

341
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:58,400
What what would you change about this memo or would you keep it exactly the same?

342
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:07,340
Is it good as is? All right. And I'm picking a policy area that we haven't covered because I think it's important to come at this fresh.

343
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:12,020
So let's take a few minutes. You think about it.

344
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:17,070
You can ask me any questions afterwards. And we'll talk about this together as a group.

345
00:34:17,400 --> 00:35:09,560
All right. To. Just ahead.

346
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:36,740
It's. Oh. And this is starting.

347
00:35:50,550 --> 00:36:05,890
I was. So I.

348
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:28,450
Let me go. I mean, I don't think they should have just done it.

349
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:41,030
I. I really like that song.

350
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:48,630
This is all for you, sir.

351
00:36:53,880 --> 00:37:04,660
Yeah. That's like and.

352
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:15,910
Yeah. I haven't seen it yet.

353
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:39,110
No know I have not totally.

354
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:46,370
I changed the trip with you just because there's a certain way.

355
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:51,220
The one thing we definitely want in this.

356
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:57,850
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

357
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:42,260
I also think. I mean, it's sort of like, oh, my gosh, it's like, this is my chance.

358
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:51,130
All I have, Tom. When it comes to.

359
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:12,729
Oh. All right.

360
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:18,280
I'm going to give him one more minute on this one, see if you can come to a consensus.

361
00:39:55,770 --> 00:40:04,510
Yeah. All right.

362
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:09,129
So. I've lost one of my cubes to someone.

363
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:13,660
Have a cube. Yes, I have. Oh, thank you. I'm so sorry.

364
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,400
So thank you. Who would like to go first?

365
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,729
Tell me. Maybe I'll do a quick poll.

366
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:24,970
Show of hands. Who thought this was a really good memo?

367
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:30,040
Who would give it ten out of ten? Okay.

368
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:34,050
Who thought this is a dreadful memo and would give it three or less out of ten?

369
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:40,760
Okay. So somewhere in the middle. Who wants to share a little bit about how you felt about this memo?

370
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:46,950
What were some good things and bad things about it? Yep.

371
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:56,200
Oh, thanks, John. So we liked that all of the titles were bolded and made it very easy to read.

372
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:02,620
But then we noticed that it was missing like a counterpoint within the memo,

373
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:07,899
and we didn't really understand, like the point of this box that's up on the screen,

374
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:13,629
because all of those action things are more like at the federal level or like higher levels,

375
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:17,410
and then they just kind of throw in the what are the regional councils doing?

376
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:25,930
Right. I think the box is interesting because it's they clearly wanted to include something to show what the organizations they represent are doing.

377
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:31,150
But it's a very boring gray box with a block of text at the end of the first page.

378
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:37,690
And it could be really important. Like I think it would depend on who the audience was for this thing.

379
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:46,090
I think they're kind of confused about who they're writing to. To be honest, um, like the Metro Man's house and house was great.

380
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:49,990
If you've never heard of them, it doesn't really tell you what they do.

381
00:41:51,490 --> 00:41:55,690
And hurray, they've got a partnership. That's great.

382
00:41:56,530 --> 00:42:04,959
I feel like they could have written this in a better way that says this partnership would mean this or this group called for this.

383
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:11,290
This is what our members are saying kind of thing. I think that was probably their intent, but it doesn't come through very strongly.

384
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:15,999
Um, the argumentation piece, I don't know if we can hold that against them.

385
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:21,100
That's not always something that you put in a policy memo is something I'm forcing all of you to put in a policy memo.

386
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:26,440
Sorry. But it's there's definitely a pedagogical component of why we're asking you to do that.

387
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:31,780
But this is not in this memo, I think was one of my thoughts.

388
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:36,400
Who wants to share something else about. Thank you. Yep.

389
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:44,010
I appreciate. And my group talked about how we like the white space and the icons that are there.

390
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:48,909
We thought that the formatting itself was allowed for you to follow along and how

391
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:53,770
the whole second page was focused on action items that were clearly addressed to,

392
00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:54,640
I think, Congress.

393
00:42:55,360 --> 00:43:03,009
And so then people could pretty easily look at the icons, look at the bolded words, as was mentioned before, of like what is the clear action item?

394
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:06,760
And then if they have the time to read a little bit more in the text underneath.

395
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:09,850
Yeah. So I think I agree with that.

396
00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:17,709
So again, we're not asking you to do anything graphic design wise in your own paper, but I do think both of you appreciated the the white space.

397
00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:22,390
And I like the way that there's a leading topic sentence at the beginning of this paragraph,

398
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:25,450
which sounds like the kind of thing that you teach it tells you to do in high school.

399
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:28,310
But it is actually kind of important. All right.

400
00:43:28,330 --> 00:43:35,470
So if I only skim this and I read first the first sentence of each paragraph, I would at least have a sense of what you're trying to convey.

401
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:42,250
I think this might be a kind of a template because I think I've used this template before and it has these little icons.

402
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:51,430
So I have sometimes these kind of rough edges, outsourcing my design, terrible design skills to someone else who has a better template.

403
00:43:51,850 --> 00:43:54,970
But the one thing I thought about with these policy.

404
00:43:56,660 --> 00:44:00,559
Yeah. I want to ask you guys, what did we think about all these policy recommendations?

405
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:06,050
So you mentioned if someone had more time, they could go through and go through these in a bit more detail.

406
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:16,049
Mine was like kind of related to the counter argument, so I'm not sure if that is necessary,

407
00:44:16,050 --> 00:44:20,670
but they kind of just keep saying increase funding increase.

408
00:44:20,790 --> 00:44:24,809
Like all of them are just increased funding over and over again.

409
00:44:24,810 --> 00:44:29,760
And I just don't think that that's like again, it's not really like.

410
00:44:30,850 --> 00:44:33,940
They're not showing like how it might be cost effective or anything,

411
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:40,960
which I think is important because not all legislators support just increasing funding to all these different things.

412
00:44:41,530 --> 00:44:51,070
Yeah, I think it's an interesting conundrum because sometimes you're in a policy area where absolutely the most important issue is the funding.

413
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:59,440
And I often writing these policy memos for the government was getting really fed up of not being able to write give money to

414
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:05,980
people who need money the most would be like I could write a very simple policy memo that says that over and over again.

415
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:12,219
The difficult part I think here is that not that they're not justified in asking for funding,

416
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:20,320
because clearly funding is needed for housing, but it's difficult to they're not giving anybody a sense of priority here.

417
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:24,250
And they've put all their policy recommendations together. So.

418
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:31,149
If they're trying to target people where they want to give them a good overview of here's our organization,

419
00:45:31,150 --> 00:45:38,979
this is what we do on housing and here are the policy here, the problems that we see in providing affordable housing.

420
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:45,800
And here's some of the policy solutions. It provides an overview, but it doesn't provide a prioritization.

421
00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:50,930
And so it might be difficult for somebody who is legit,

422
00:45:51,530 --> 00:45:58,370
like a legislative staffer might read this and get a lot out of it potentially if they're trying to learn about these different policy areas.

423
00:45:58,370 --> 00:46:06,080
But I suspect it would be more effective to ask about one thing at a time and make prioritize your requests.

424
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:13,820
Now, that's not easy to do if you're in a situation where your policy really calls for action on all fronts.

425
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:19,790
And maybe these issues are very interlinked in some really important ways where they couldn't filter that out.

426
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:26,390
But I would say one thing to do would be to write another brief, frankly,

427
00:46:26,390 --> 00:46:34,700
which is a one page thing that concentrates on one of these issues at a time or figure out how they're going to fit into a legislative package.

428
00:46:35,150 --> 00:46:42,979
If you had legislation on the table that might be quite important, then anybody else want to come in on this this memo for anything at all?

429
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:51,590
Yeah, please. Sorry. I also think that, like just from the first page, you don't really know.

430
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:55,730
Like if someone's just glancing at this, you don't really know what their policy recommendations are.

431
00:46:56,120 --> 00:47:02,479
Like, I think it would be helpful to have the executive summary or to have like what their bottom line is just at the beginning,

432
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,940
because they do a really good job of providing why it's an issue.

433
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:09,820
But someone just glancing at it would need to like read more to see what they're advocating for,

434
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:16,160
which I think is hard when you're expecting someone to be reading it and not a lot of time necessarily to look into it.

435
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:19,740
Yeah. And could you prosecute just for. Yeah.

436
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:24,440
To add to that, I think that they could work on their title to be like less general,

437
00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:29,150
like informational and more what they want and who their audiences.

438
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:37,220
And also, I was going to say for the second page, I would put those in bullet points because they're kind of an A-list style anyway.

439
00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:41,210
Mm hmm. And I'm a big skimmer, and I did not read them the first time around.

440
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:49,159
This is true. And I did read them a few times, and I still, I, I couldn't memorize them and read them recite them back to you by heart.

441
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:53,750
So. Yeah, you're right. This, that my my critique of this brief,

442
00:47:53,900 --> 00:48:00,260
brief overall and I think it is a pretty good one but not terrific is that it doesn't know whether they're

443
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:04,910
arguing for something specific or whether they want to give an overview to the public of all the problems.

444
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:07,340
And they've tried to put everything in one brief,

445
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:13,700
which I think would be less effective than having multiple communication pieces for different audiences.

446
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:20,420
Like something that explains why this work is so important to the public and why this problem is so serious.

447
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:22,940
And some separate things that are like,

448
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:31,270
here are some concrete things that you should do in your legislative package legislators or you should do in your regulatory reform bureaucrats.

449
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:35,450
I feel like it's trying to do both things at once. Okay.

450
00:48:35,510 --> 00:48:38,750
Does anybody else have a comment on this brief? I'm going to make you do one more.

451
00:48:40,830 --> 00:48:46,890
All right. We're going to do same process. I think we're going to do this one. And maybe I'm biased here.

452
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:55,300
It's from the Buckeye Institute. So be as critical as you like depending on your allegiances to Ohio and Michigan.

453
00:48:55,600 --> 00:49:01,300
Now I'm joking. So this one is about barriers to mental health services.

454
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:05,830
It's part of a serious, clearly policy solutions for the pandemic.

455
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:10,750
Don't cheat and read this first, but there is a review of this thing.

456
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:14,380
So if you really want to get into reviewing and critiquing policy memos,

457
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:19,090
which I think would be boring to do for any longer than the duration of this class.

458
00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:27,760
You can go to the Harvard Kennedy School's website where they have policy memo reviews and they have lots of policy memos.

459
00:49:27,770 --> 00:49:29,350
They have a database of these things.

460
00:49:29,710 --> 00:49:36,910
I have included the link to this in the slides if anybody wants to go look at some memos while they're thinking about their own memo.

461
00:49:37,450 --> 00:49:44,650
But back to this. I want you guys to the link in the PowerPoint will take you to this page.

462
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:49,569
Just click on the memo link. And it will give you this document.

463
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:56,050
I want you to read that first and then we'll have a look at their review and see what they thought about this memo.

464
00:49:56,060 --> 00:50:00,840
So take a couple minutes to have a look at that and then we'll do the same thing and have a group discussion.

465
00:50:00,850 --> 00:50:56,380
Okay. You can talk to each other.

466
00:51:00,110 --> 00:51:03,140
It's a lot to read, though, which I think is my first critique maybe.

467
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:51,930
I was able to. We chatted about.

468
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:19,550
And I guess. I.

469
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:35,190
Be. A lot of.

470
00:53:42,060 --> 00:54:10,880
I. We're talking about.

471
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:57,910
Guess. Honestly, I thought this was actually.

472
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:20,790
How do you. And operations.

473
00:55:27,890 --> 00:55:44,450
Do. All right, take one more minute.

474
00:55:44,450 --> 00:55:48,020
Wrap it up. Meanwhile, the.

475
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:56,510
But now they're there. Everything right now it's just hearing on the order of as you know without.

476
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:59,220
Having enough energy to get through.

477
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:10,260
I felt like just seeing Christian that we go from a very large conference with the government in Austria last week.

478
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:16,080
The impression was that most countries think they're going to be okay this winter, but they're very concerned about next fall.

479
00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:22,270
And that's true. I think in general, it'll be it'll be all right.

480
00:56:22,290 --> 00:56:27,900
So we're not anticipating, oh, like blackouts like that.

481
00:56:29,190 --> 00:56:33,220
But I'll see. I'll be there, actually. Lucky.

482
00:56:33,330 --> 00:56:36,870
Yeah. Good luck. All right.

483
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:41,820
Switzerland is probably still taking Russian energy right now.

484
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:45,610
Switzerland? I don't know how. Um.

485
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:49,890
All right, so what do you guys think of this one?

486
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:56,360
Who would rate this anything like eight or more out of ten.

487
00:56:57,420 --> 00:57:01,160
No. Five or more out of ten. Okay.

488
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:05,360
Three or more out of ten. Absolute fat zero.

489
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:10,150
Yeah. I think I would have said, Oh, that's too cool.

490
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:17,830
I'm not that to greater, I swear, but a few points, but not many, which is a real crying shame.

491
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:22,660
Somebody obviously knows this policy and has thought about it and has put some words on paper.

492
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:25,990
But what what was good and what was bad about this?

493
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:31,329
Let's see if we can come up with a couple of good things first, before we come up with some critiques.

494
00:57:31,330 --> 00:57:31,780
Yeah, please.

495
00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:50,640
So at first I wasn't really sure what the right words were doing because I just read each of the red words first and there was no like pattern.

496
00:57:50,910 --> 00:57:56,460
But then I realized that they're links, which is kind of cool, that they lead to like other things.

497
00:57:56,490 --> 00:58:04,390
Oh, let's click on this link and see. What we so yeah coping with stress for the so from the CDC that's not that's not good.

498
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:09,880
That doesn't that doesn't make me feel better about this. But yeah, I think links are good.

499
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:14,280
But there is a question, actually a really pertinent question,

500
00:58:14,290 --> 00:58:20,140
like when you put something like this on the Internet, it's difficult if somebody prints this out or use it.

501
00:58:22,630 --> 00:58:27,680
Takes this off of an online format to distribute. Then that information is lost, right?

502
00:58:27,690 --> 00:58:32,980
So I think they're using these as their references, as that citation, the evidence is.

503
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:36,549
Was that your impression? I just thought it was like more information.

504
00:58:36,550 --> 00:58:40,630
But I guess you're right. If it's. Yeah, it's. That must be the emergency order.

505
00:58:43,730 --> 00:58:46,740
Yeah. These are all the. Oh, yeah.

506
00:58:46,750 --> 00:58:50,400
These are the actual original texts of the emergency orders.

507
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:55,320
Okay. So, I mean, that's reasonable online, but you do have to think a little bit.

508
00:58:56,820 --> 00:59:01,379
I know that we're all online in this age and we have all this ridiculous technology

509
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:04,950
that you have to grapple with to take courses at the University of Michigan.

510
00:59:05,310 --> 00:59:12,540
But when you think about this, do think about what will happen when somebody prints this thing out and especially if you use color.

511
00:59:13,590 --> 00:59:19,050
Most people don't have a color printer. What happens when you print something out and it's in black and white?

512
00:59:19,530 --> 00:59:25,679
That's not so important for this memo, but it is really important if you write to do anything where you use a figure and you

513
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:30,780
use colors to differentiate the different trajectories on your graph or something,

514
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:34,530
different bits of the data. That's not going to translate into black and white.

515
00:59:34,540 --> 00:59:39,779
So I would recommend for all policy things that you do, like a black and white check.

516
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:47,669
You can see how it looks in black and white on most programs because not everybody has the same level of access to technology that you do,

517
00:59:47,670 --> 00:59:51,510
and maybe you want this to be accessible to different audiences.

518
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:56,700
Sorry, I'm running away with your point there. Okay. What else was did you think about this memo?

519
00:59:59,250 --> 01:00:07,130
Not just my my nice participant here but yeah that's good because he had is also someone here to get his.

520
01:00:12,130 --> 01:00:16,470
Well, I guess in terms of a positive thing, there's plenty of background.

521
01:00:16,890 --> 01:00:26,190
This is true. Almost the entire paper is all background evidence based on kind of what has already happened and what they're currently working on.

522
01:00:27,330 --> 01:00:30,610
But then it's very limited when you get to what they're asking for.

523
01:00:30,630 --> 01:00:34,830
That's I think it's like one line at the end in terms of what they're asking for it to happen now.

524
01:00:35,370 --> 01:00:39,750
So it's a lot of like currently and previously, but not a lot of moving forward.

525
01:00:40,110 --> 01:00:43,349
Right. And so you might want to do that in some circumstances.

526
01:00:43,350 --> 01:00:47,160
Maybe they're trying to write this specifically for those licensing boards,

527
01:00:47,490 --> 01:00:51,030
although I would hope that the licensing boards would understand this issue already.

528
01:00:52,650 --> 01:00:56,760
But they might be, you know, trying to be generous here.

529
01:00:56,910 --> 01:01:01,889
There might be an audience that you want to write to where they really do need a lot of background.

530
01:01:01,890 --> 01:01:07,650
And we are going to spend most of the time trying to frame the problem, but they almost exclusively provide background.

531
01:01:07,650 --> 01:01:12,690
So it's almost like this that this feels to me like an intern did it, frankly,

532
01:01:13,110 --> 01:01:18,910
and they read a lot of stuff and they compile it together, which is not invaluable work, right?

533
01:01:18,930 --> 01:01:25,829
That's very valuable work. But you need to take maybe the next step from that and then try to figure out one of the things that

534
01:01:25,830 --> 01:01:31,770
we've now learned which of the most important pieces of information to present to that audience.

535
01:01:31,770 --> 01:01:32,070
Right.

536
01:01:32,430 --> 01:01:45,839
It's about targeted communication in that way, because I would say a decent student at the University of Ohio would be looking at this or Ohio State.

537
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:53,879
I have colleagues who work at both who would be able to look at this and say, okay, I can do this research, I can do this in half a day.

538
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:58,440
I can write this thing up. It's it's decently written, which is why it's a bit of a shame, to be honest,

539
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:04,979
because this background is in there and they understand the policy just fine and they know where to get the information.

540
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:08,520
But it's not really doesn't help them be persuasive.

541
01:02:09,590 --> 01:02:12,840
Did you want to come in with you? You're coming? Yeah, I was.

542
01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:16,400
Well, my. What I was going to say goes back to what Warren was saying about the links.

543
01:02:16,670 --> 01:02:22,069
I just the first thing I noticed is that the words that are bolded are just kind of strange.

544
01:02:22,070 --> 01:02:27,440
Strange. Like, I think if these policy memos are supposed to be brief, you should.

545
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:30,520
It's helpful to, like, bold your key points.

546
01:02:30,530 --> 01:02:34,040
Like. Like that. Like the last one, like that second page.

547
01:02:34,340 --> 01:02:40,999
But I think here they could have done a better job of exposing the most important points of the background that way when you first read it,

548
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:46,100
those are the first things that your eyes are drawn to. And before reading everything, you can get a sense of everything.

549
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:50,930
And then if you want to read more, you can read more. Yeah, it's a really bad graphic design choice.

550
01:02:51,290 --> 01:02:55,000
Did anybody ever use word or is that even still a thing where you.

551
01:02:55,020 --> 01:03:00,679
So it's a website you can paste in the full text of some document and it will go through and

552
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:05,480
represent graphically the main the words that are most frequently cited in that document.

553
01:03:05,750 --> 01:03:09,380
And so people make like a word cloud. It's like a workout.

554
01:03:09,650 --> 01:03:13,130
And the problem is that the words that are highlighted are not particularly significant.

555
01:03:13,430 --> 01:03:19,130
So like emergency order allows similar order lead granted temporary licenses.

556
01:03:19,310 --> 01:03:24,620
Yeah, that's that's really unhelpful in terms of I agree in terms of trying to get the message across.

557
01:03:25,010 --> 01:03:30,350
So when I say bold and things to make sure the things you put in bold are the most important things.

558
01:03:31,430 --> 01:03:41,630
Yeah. Who else wants to come in on this brief, please? Um, I think that it has a lot of good background information, like everyone said.

559
01:03:42,590 --> 01:03:50,120
I don't think that having all these links is really helpful because a lot of people don't want to be clicking around and,

560
01:03:50,120 --> 01:04:02,480
like, finding information in other places. I wish that they had had they had included like direct evidence or like numbers because

561
01:04:02,690 --> 01:04:08,930
reading all this text is not super like it doesn't like really drive the point home.

562
01:04:09,770 --> 01:04:19,249
I wish they had added like statistics about how many people are struggling with this and then like bolded their request,

563
01:04:19,250 --> 01:04:24,980
which is to allow out-of-state mental health providers to practice in Ohio,

564
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:34,130
which is like their ask and who is actually going to be able to do this rather than like all this extra information.

565
01:04:34,580 --> 01:04:41,120
Yeah. So that they're trying to make permanent changes that were enacted during the pandemic, which is not a stupid request.

566
01:04:41,810 --> 01:04:42,110
Um.

567
01:04:43,530 --> 01:04:50,720
Some people might get very frustrated at that request because it doesn't necessarily solve all the problems, but it is at least a specific request.

568
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:55,800
They kind of run into trouble because in the beginning you notice it says Ohio should do this.

569
01:04:56,220 --> 01:05:01,020
And at the end, who are the people who actually have to make a decision about this?

570
01:05:02,770 --> 01:05:06,910
They say the medical, the licensing boards and the legislature.

571
01:05:07,210 --> 01:05:15,340
So the General Assembly is the legislature. So, yes, they're right about that, but it doesn't help much that there's that ambiguity there.

572
01:05:15,670 --> 01:05:23,110
Right. So to my mind, it seems like it's a very it's an obvious policy action to take.

573
01:05:23,110 --> 01:05:28,030
But they spend all this time giving you background. It reads more like a web copy or a blog post.

574
01:05:28,030 --> 01:05:31,599
Frankly, you can put this on your Web site just fine. And maybe they did.

575
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:35,170
And then maybe they turned it into a memo afterwards.

576
01:05:36,010 --> 01:05:39,890
Does anyone else want to come in on this one? Please.

577
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:44,930
Can we pass it that way? Great. Thank you.

578
01:05:46,220 --> 01:05:54,020
This kind of goes along with what you're saying, but when I was reading this, I felt like there wasn't a lot of actual evidence.

579
01:05:54,440 --> 01:06:00,979
It was a lot of background, but like. And like what we've done and like, yeah, like you said, like it makes sense to continue it.

580
01:06:00,980 --> 01:06:05,840
But they didn't really say like, hey, these things have improved health outcomes like.

581
01:06:06,770 --> 01:06:12,049
They didn't really give a Y that these things should be implemented, even though it is for some people.

582
01:06:12,050 --> 01:06:19,790
More like. Just like naturally occurring, like for the people that are reading this, that's not going to be the case.

583
01:06:19,790 --> 01:06:23,600
So they shouldn't have left dots to connect. They should have connected them.

584
01:06:24,170 --> 01:06:28,790
Right. And I don't know what the exact date of this was. Does it have the date on there somewhere?

585
01:06:30,590 --> 01:06:36,829
The top somewhere. Okay. So they might not have had the evidence on some of these points,

586
01:06:36,830 --> 01:06:44,150
although I think they are relatively convincing and they kind of resting on the fact that Ohio's already done some of these things for these reasons.

587
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:51,799
But they don't really highlight that if they'd said it started more straight up with Ohio has done these things temporarily,

588
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:56,570
recognizing that these are serious problems. We should have this situation permanently.

589
01:06:57,030 --> 01:07:06,570
They don't they never really say these problems that were highlighted now by the pandemic are ongoing, systemic issues that we need to solve.

590
01:07:06,590 --> 01:07:10,159
They never quite get there, I think. Yes.

591
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:14,719
So the background is not framing the problem in the most crisp way.

592
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:18,080
I think you're right. All right. Anyone else on this one?

593
01:07:19,430 --> 01:07:23,600
Please. So we'll go back. Fabulous.

594
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:30,230
Thank you. I thought it was interesting how the recommendation was before the background information.

595
01:07:31,820 --> 01:07:37,729
Like, usually I think the recommendation goes after, you know, a little bit about the background information.

596
01:07:37,730 --> 01:07:43,850
So it was a little bit confusing in terms of format. Yeah, I would say normally I would agree with you.

597
01:07:43,850 --> 01:07:46,909
I think it's good to put the recommendation at the top.

598
01:07:46,910 --> 01:07:52,250
But what they don't do, I think, is I would tend to to do it in this way.

599
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:57,770
Here's the problem. Here's why the problem is important. Here's our recommendation, like in three sentences.

600
01:07:58,100 --> 01:08:03,589
And they don't do that. They just say, we need to do this. And so if you just read that first paragraph,

601
01:08:03,590 --> 01:08:10,390
you wouldn't know why this was an important problem or even really what the problem is, I think, which is a an issue.

602
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:13,880
Just scroll up a little bit. Yeah. Thank you, Jana.

603
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:19,060
So, yeah, they should do this. We should do this.

604
01:08:19,060 --> 01:08:23,620
We should do this. The three things they should do. But I would prefer to see.

605
01:08:24,670 --> 01:08:28,690
Here's the problem. You know, the mental health so framed in that way,

606
01:08:28,690 --> 01:08:37,470
in the sense of we've we've done some things during the pandemic that should be permanent because these health problems are very serious.

607
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:45,370
Here's the problem. This is why it's serious and why it remains serious, even if the pandemic goes away, which, of course, didn't at this point.

608
01:08:46,810 --> 01:08:51,010
And then this should be a recommendation and I wouldn't pick three of them.

609
01:08:51,010 --> 01:08:55,270
It's a very pedestrian way of framing the sentences, too, I guess.

610
01:08:56,770 --> 01:09:01,100
See, I hope you can see how you can be infinitely picky about some of these memos.

611
01:09:01,130 --> 01:09:05,260
This is not to say that you shouldn't. Don't go too far down that rabbit hole.

612
01:09:05,530 --> 01:09:07,750
Like I say, the perfect memo is not possible.

613
01:09:08,050 --> 01:09:13,900
And even if you could write one, it wouldn't necessarily fix the politics that would lead you to see the change that you want to see.

614
01:09:14,410 --> 01:09:17,590
But I want to see what the Harvard students thought about this,

615
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:23,170
because I am I'm guessing here that this is students writing this, although I don't know.

616
01:09:23,740 --> 01:09:28,870
I know they've all got master's degrees, so goodness knows. So the memo was reviewed by these people.

617
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:36,209
Um. So. Identify their native representation before introducing the problem.

618
01:09:36,210 --> 01:09:37,710
So the problem statements are not good.

619
01:09:37,710 --> 01:09:46,580
We kind of said that the memo's persuasiveness is constrained by lack of data, story or decision making technique.

620
01:09:46,590 --> 01:09:48,540
Great. We brought that up in the discussion.

621
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:57,090
The memo's tone is relatively formal, which I think is okay, and they say they don't use jargon, which is fair enough.

622
01:09:57,690 --> 01:10:00,479
The writing is clear. We didn't really mention those strengths.

623
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:06,389
I think it is a decently written memo and then the solution is presented without considering other options.

624
01:10:06,390 --> 01:10:13,050
So they didn't provide any alternatives. Okay, this is just to introduce this as a resource to you guys.

625
01:10:13,350 --> 01:10:17,940
If anybody has questions about the policy memo going forward, please come see us in the policy salon.

626
01:10:17,940 --> 01:10:29,220
Thank you for your time and attention. I'll see you in the next class. Yes.
