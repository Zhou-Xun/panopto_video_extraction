00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:10,870
Welcome to six 34 is module on linking transmission models to epidemiological metrics.

2
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:14,830
Part one, force of infection in this module.

3
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:18,880
In these modules, I will formally introduced the following measures.

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,740
Forced infection. Prevalence. Attack rate. Average age to infection.

5
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:30,420
Herd immunity and reproductive number. Part one will focus on the force of infection.

6
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:37,230
Are learning objectives of these modules are one to describe how standard epidemiological measures are used in

7
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:46,230
transmission models and to to describe epidemiological measures that are derived from transmission models.

8
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:54,880
The traditional epidemiological paradigm is based on risk factor analysis that is taught in introduction to epidemiology courses,

9
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:59,500
relative risks are estimated by comparing people that are exposed to people that

10
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:04,270
are not exposed at assessing whether there are differences in disease rates.

11
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:09,970
The basic question is whether an exposure is associated with the disease outcome.

12
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:18,460
We in epidemiology also distinguish between descriptive studies that are hypothesis generating and analytic studies that are hypothesis testing.

13
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:25,480
In both cases, the data collected comprise individual level data on disease and exposure.

14
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:35,890
Most importantly, all the statistical approaches used to estimate relative risk assumes that observations are independent.

15
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:40,360
On the other hand, transmission models take on a systems level perspective.

16
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:47,440
Observations are assumed to be interdependent and therefore our risk estimates rely.

17
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,650
Risk estimates are based on counterfactuals.

18
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:59,500
That is, we run a scenario twice, one with the intervention and one without and compare the different outcomes.

19
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:07,450
Again, this is in contrast to epidemiology where we are generally comparing two different population groups.

20
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:16,000
In this lecture, I will cover standard ethnological measures such as Faustman, infection prevalence and attack rate.

21
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:23,710
I will also cover other measures such as average age to infection, herd immunity and reproductive number.

22
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:30,940
Let's start with the force infection in this slide. I'm going to show that when the force of infection is constant.

23
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:37,320
It's equal to the incidence. First, let's define forceful infection.

24
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:44,160
It is the instantaneous per capita rate of change of the number of individuals at risk of infection.

25
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:49,070
And now it gets to our per capita growth rate definition for population growth models.

26
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:57,180
Force infection is equal to minus DSD t divided by s as being the numbers susceptible.

27
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:04,110
That is a force of infection is the rate of leaving the susceptible state and moving into the infected state.

28
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:09,860
It forced the infection is constant. Let's label it lowercase I.

29
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:14,130
Then the number is susceptible. Decrease exponentially over time.

30
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:22,590
At rate I, it is the same solution of the differential equation we explored when examining the exponential growth model.

31
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:29,370
Except that instead of exponentially increasing the number of susceptible or ask financially decreasing,

32
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:37,210
as with our transmission model rate parameters. One over.

33
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:44,680
As with our transmission rate, our transmission model rate parameters, one over the rate of leaving the estate.

34
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:49,900
In this case, a little lower case I is the average time to infection.

35
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:56,730
If we are modeling one time, infections is equal to the average age to infection.

36
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:11,670
Next, let's look at how we calculate Ensign intensity given in cases at a time two, in fact, and a time to infection for each case I labeled T.J.,

37
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:16,920
then incidence density is the following is the following where the number of cases

38
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:22,580
and is in the numerator and the total person time summation is in the denominator.

39
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:28,570
This is exactly how incidence density is defined in epidemiology courses.

40
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:37,850
The inverse of this ratio is the average time to infection.

41
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:43,550
Therefore, the forceful infection when constant is equal to the incidence density.

42
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:51,230
Just how we defined it in epidemiology. What happens when the force of infection is not constant?

43
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:59,390
And it varies over time. Let's look at our transmission model for S.A.S. or S.A, our models.

44
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:05,890
We see that the rate that the per capita rate of decrease in the number susceptible is our definition of force.

45
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:10,580
Infection equals to minus our transmission rate.

46
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:21,030
Beda times I. At steady state, that is when DADT is equal to zero, we have minus Beda times I.

47
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:27,590
Times S plus Delta times I equals zero.

48
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:35,720
With a little algebra, we arrive at Beda times, eyes equal to Delta Times, eye divided by S.

49
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:45,930
Where Beda Times eye is the incidence, Delta is the recovery rate, and one over Delta is a disease duration.

50
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:52,370
And finally. High over s is approximation of the prevalence.

51
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:57,320
When s is much, much greater than I.

52
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:06,170
Therefore, from this equation, we get prevalence high over S is equal to incidents, better times, eye times, disease, duration.

53
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:11,000
D or one over Delta.

54
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:19,380
This approximation that the prevalence is equal to incidents times, that this duration is based on the following assumptions, the state.

55
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:24,290
The system is a steady state, i.e. TSD is equal to zero.

56
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:31,100
The disease duration D is constant. An eye is much, much less than S.

57
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:35,720
These are the assumptions we made to drive this relationship.

58
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:46,990
P is equal to five times D. The cataclysmic climatic catalytic model has a long history in epidemiology and is

59
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:52,570
used to estimate the force of infection from age stratified prevalence curves.

60
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:58,480
Here is the model where Lambda is the force infection in you.

61
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:10,080
The number is susceptible. Number is susceptible. This is our basic assay, our model where Lambda is Beda Times I.

62
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:20,690
Here we are focused on. How these models can be used to estimate the forceful infection using cross-sectional Sara prevalence data.

63
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:25,110
And as we take blood samples at one point in time from a sample,

64
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:34,040
a pop sample of the population and look at the proportion within age groups that are, Sara, positive for a given pathogen.

65
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:43,160
So in this graph, we have data on the proportion of people that are, Sarah, positive for a given age where they age range.

66
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:52,430
Ranges from two to 62 years, data on the young provide information on recent force infection levels.

67
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:57,260
For example, these circles are the data for two to eight year olds.

68
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:02,670
And these data tell us about the infectivity in the last eight years.

69
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:09,590
On the other age extreme, we have information on the Sarah prevalence for those fifty six to sixty two years.

70
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:14,840
Their infection occurred sometime in the past fifty six to sixty two years.

71
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:19,340
So this is the only age group divide information about infection, the infection.

72
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:28,790
Fifty six to sixty two years ago. There's a lot of information about the past in these data.

73
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:37,270
If you questions, we can ask here, which diseases are these models appropriate for?

74
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:45,560
The answer, the disease that confers all diseases that confer long term immunity.

75
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:51,890
Another question, these curves suggests that the force for infection Wisconsin over the past 60 years.

76
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:56,600
Why is that the case? Get the force. The infection is constant.

77
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:05,300
That is lamda is constant in our model above. Looks just like the equation for the loss of susceptible two slides ago.

78
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:11,370
The solution to the differential equation is a decreasing exponential function.

79
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:17,660
The Sarah prevalence curve on this slide represents the R state in the essay Our Model.

80
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:25,330
Those that have conferred immunity to the fraction of the population that is zero positive is one minus S.

81
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:31,650
And mine minus. So that leaves us with one minus the exponential.

82
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:39,150
E to the minus lamda times T, which is a concave function that increases and saturates that one.

83
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:50,020
Therefore, if Sarah prevalence data takes this shape, this suggests that the force infection was constant over the past sixty two years.

84
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:56,030
Lastly, how would the curve look if the force infection was a low?

85
00:09:56,030 --> 00:10:01,460
Was at low levels in the past decade, but was constant.

86
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,530
Prior to that period,

87
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:13,070
then there would be very few Sarah positive cases represented in the zero to 10 year olds after which the Sarah positivity would increase.

88
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:24,975
Much like the one minus exponential curve that you see on the left.
