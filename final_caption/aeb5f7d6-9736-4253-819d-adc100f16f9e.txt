1
00:00:05,652 --> 00:00:12,762
Joanna Kovacevich: But in the meantime, we want to welcome you to this session of tools for collaboration and engagement.

2
00:00:12,762 --> 00:00:22,272
Joanna Kovacevich: My name is Joanna come back of itch I am the instructional technology consultant, and with me is Monica rosen do you wanna say hello, Monica.

3
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:31,152
Monica Rosen: hi everybody a like join I was saying i'm Monica i'm one of the instructional designers on the team, so you probably.

4
00:00:31,152 --> 00:00:40,512
Monica Rosen: I don't like I see a few people that i've met here before, but i'm the one who is this year with developing your courses and so.

5
00:00:40,512 --> 00:00:47,142
Joanna Kovacevich: i'm putting the pole link in once more um you still have time to take that survey.

6
00:00:47,142 --> 00:01:03,402
Joanna Kovacevich: A few things before we get started this session is actually scheduled to go until 1230 it's a 90 minute session but do please feel free to leave early if you need to we're recording this and we'll plan to share it out with you later this afternoon.

7
00:01:03,402 --> 00:01:06,702
Joanna Kovacevich: We.

8
00:01:06,702 --> 00:01:19,122
Joanna Kovacevich: have now enabled live transcript so at the bottom of your screen, you should be able to turn that on in case you would like to see a subtitle or transcript.

9
00:01:19,122 --> 00:01:23,712
Joanna Kovacevich: During today's session, please feel free to do so on your end.

10
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:37,122
Joanna Kovacevich: And for questions, we would be more than happy to answer any questions if you'd like to unmute your microphone just know that that will be captured on the recording and we may be sharing this later in our resilient teaching site.

11
00:01:37,122 --> 00:01:51,522
Joanna Kovacevich: If you'd rather not be on camera please feel free to ask any questions you have in the chat I have my window open and I know Monica has hers so that we can keep an eye on those.

12
00:01:51,522 --> 00:02:09,072
Joanna Kovacevich: So let's see what we got in our survey, so the first question we asked was what is the teaching mode, for your fall residential courses and we've got 50% only teaching in person.

13
00:02:09,072 --> 00:02:26,832
Joanna Kovacevich: And then we've got some that are 25% only teaching remotely and then both, and so one of the things we want to be able to help you with today is seeing how these can be used in either mode.

14
00:02:26,832 --> 00:02:46,692
Joanna Kovacevich: And then, what are you what's on your mind most when thinking about student engagement this semester so last term I had breakout rooms in every class not clear how to replicate that this term in person, but still socially distance that's a great question and very relevant.

15
00:02:46,692 --> 00:03:08,982
Joanna Kovacevich: ways to increase engagement, given the current circumstance hopeful to increase engagement compared to last year, so it's great so you have you sort of have a you know how it went last year and you're hoping to build on that and improve and so that that will be interesting to see ups.

16
00:03:08,982 --> 00:03:14,292
Joanna Kovacevich: managing it so it doesn't take too much time.

17
00:03:14,292 --> 00:03:16,542
That sounds good.

18
00:03:16,542 --> 00:03:24,762
Joanna Kovacevich: So we definitely want to keep those things in mind as we go through our learning objectives for this session, the ones we set up.

19
00:03:24,762 --> 00:03:33,522
Joanna Kovacevich: Our to identify the various ED tech tools available here at university of Michigan but also some that are unique to school of public health.

20
00:03:33,522 --> 00:03:38,892
Joanna Kovacevich: That foster student engagement and collaboration and how you can incorporate those in your teaching.

21
00:03:38,892 --> 00:03:46,932
Joanna Kovacevich: we're going to assess the utility of these tools and basically will just be presenting the utility and then you're going to know best.

22
00:03:46,932 --> 00:03:59,652
Joanna Kovacevich: How that will figure into your course and we're of course happy to answer any questions you might have, as you seek to meet those learning objectives and competencies for your courses.

23
00:03:59,652 --> 00:04:12,582
Joanna Kovacevich: And then, as I mentioned, will be outlining the primary function of these, but we want you to be able to have a sense of the primary function of each of these tools and know how these can be used to support.

24
00:04:12,582 --> 00:04:20,262
Joanna Kovacevich: Both remote and you're in in teaching person in person teaching sorry.

25
00:04:20,262 --> 00:04:22,632
Joanna Kovacevich: Now i'm going to hand it off to Monica.

26
00:04:22,632 --> 00:04:27,642
Monica Rosen: Right So the first thing that I want to do.

27
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:35,382
Monica Rosen: Is is to ask the question how can these tools, be used to foster engagement and collaboration and there's two main steps that you're going to be taking.

28
00:04:35,382 --> 00:04:41,712
Monica Rosen: The first one is to identify what your course level learning objectives for companies are if you've gone through our.

29
00:04:41,712 --> 00:04:54,702
Monica Rosen: process, you probably have a few of them and ask yourself what is it that you want the students to be able to do with the content that you're presenting them within the course and throughout the modules.

30
00:04:54,702 --> 00:05:05,202
Monica Rosen: One strategy is to use bloom's taxonomy to kind of get an idea about what the action verbs are and how to map that on to what the tool that you're interested in using is going to facilitate that action.

31
00:05:05,202 --> 00:05:12,852
Monica Rosen: So, then, the second step is to assess what tools, you need to actually support the students achievement of that learning objectives.

32
00:05:12,852 --> 00:05:14,472
Hsing-Fang Hsieh: And so you don't necessarily want to.

33
00:05:14,472 --> 00:05:31,782
Monica Rosen: use a tool, just for the sake of using the tool, you heard another course is using this tool and you just kind of want to find a way to weasel it in, we want to make sure that it's actually doing something to help the students gain mastery of your learning objectives.

34
00:05:31,782 --> 00:05:43,872
Monica Rosen: So some of the tools that we will be going over and this presentation is we're going to talk about G suite which is great, because at U of m, we have the full package available to.

35
00:05:43,872 --> 00:05:52,272
Monica Rosen: faculty and staff, the main one that we're going to kind of focus on our on the slides and how to use as an innovative ways in your courses.

36
00:05:52,272 --> 00:06:04,422
Monica Rosen: je suis a collection of collaborative cloud based Google programs, some of you probably like you used it to some degree, some may traders sway away from a while others embrace it completely.

37
00:06:04,422 --> 00:06:09,702
Monica Rosen: But there are ways that you can use it personally but also in a classroom setting with students.

38
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:22,752
Monica Rosen: The next one is perusal perusal is a social annotation E reader basically most professors use perusal by uploading their PDF readings and then they have students engage with the readings.

39
00:06:22,752 --> 00:06:33,222
Monica Rosen: with each other by being able to annotate and add highlighting and have a conversation regarding the reading and an offline asynchronous manner, and there are other ways, you can use perusal for.

40
00:06:33,222 --> 00:06:41,892
Monica Rosen: web based readings as well we'll kind of talk about that, when we get to that section, the next one is poll everywhere likely you've seen.

41
00:06:41,892 --> 00:06:46,992
Monica Rosen: poll everywhere used if you've dropped in in any of the school public health.

42
00:06:46,992 --> 00:06:52,392
Monica Rosen: town halls they were having fun with those cloud based types of polls.

43
00:06:52,392 --> 00:07:01,482
Monica Rosen: And these are live interactive experiences that display immediate results, but we had in the beginning, you can have these kind of covered up surveys that show up later.

44
00:07:01,482 --> 00:07:07,002
Monica Rosen: You can they can be personally for you or you can have the students engaging with it and other ways as well.

45
00:07:07,002 --> 00:07:13,962
Monica Rosen: The next one, is a newest tool in our toolbox and that's yellow dig, this is a student driven type social network.

46
00:07:13,962 --> 00:07:28,512
Monica Rosen: That is based on educational setting so it takes to kind of have that discussion board and moves it a little bit further along, so you have more of like a scrolling feed system that kind of looks like Facebook or Twitter and students engage with it in a very.

47
00:07:28,512 --> 00:07:38,472
Monica Rosen: less formal way so it's still around the education and the content but it's not like a whole written out paper um they can share hashtag at each other and things like that.

48
00:07:38,472 --> 00:07:43,002
Monica Rosen: And the last one is probably one that you're fairly familiar with, at this point zoom.

49
00:07:43,002 --> 00:07:53,562
Monica Rosen: Which is a video conference program that fosters with large and small group discussions, and so we won't spend too much time on zoom since many of you are very likely familiar with it, we will talk about some of the newest.

50
00:07:53,562 --> 00:08:07,272
Monica Rosen: features, because you know you're probably getting those prompts every couple of weeks, like we are to update your zoom there's new features so we'll try and cover the most interesting newest features provided by zoom.

51
00:08:07,272 --> 00:08:20,202
Monica Rosen: So first off we're going to start with G sweet and the Google suite has a variety of plethora really a programs that you can use, so the main ones, I want to talk about our slides docs.

52
00:08:20,202 --> 00:08:23,052
Monica Rosen: and jam board.

53
00:08:23,052 --> 00:08:34,842
Monica Rosen: As mentioned, this is a collaborative cloud based processor, you can drop documents any type of word documents you want apple if you're a little bit older maybe you remember back in the day of open.

54
00:08:34,842 --> 00:08:48,252
Monica Rosen: That Doc processor, and it can maintain its file extension as a Doc X or you can convert it to a Google document, enabling it to be used more collaboratively.

55
00:08:48,252 --> 00:08:54,912
Monica Rosen: The Google docs system is it has both folders and files which many of you are already familiar with and use it regularly.

56
00:08:54,912 --> 00:09:04,362
Monica Rosen: But you can have these as private or shared so you can have them use them for your own personal base, but you can actually set up a shared course wide shared folder.

57
00:09:04,362 --> 00:09:09,462
Monica Rosen: and which maybe you have students submitting assignments directly to a particular folder in the course.

58
00:09:09,462 --> 00:09:18,432
Monica Rosen: And then you can enable it so that students can either just view the document, maybe you have a PDF and you don't want them touching anything on there just one way to look at it.

59
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:22,992
Monica Rosen: Or you can have them actually editing together as a group, one master document.

60
00:09:22,992 --> 00:09:33,462
Monica Rosen: But another really interesting way that you could do it is you can enable the commenting feature on there, so you can share it only with commenting ability so i'm i've seen a couple of professors use interactive syllabus.

61
00:09:33,462 --> 00:09:41,712
Monica Rosen: So instead of saying hey you can email me if you have questions about the syllabus or put some questions in the discussion Board which they may or may not do.

62
00:09:41,712 --> 00:09:46,362
Monica Rosen: Or you can enable comment, and they can actually ask their question directly on the.

63
00:09:46,362 --> 00:10:00,012
Monica Rosen: On the document and all the other students, as you answer them on the document can see the responses and then you know that maybe next year you'd like to you know address the common concerns that are coming up with it directly in that same document.

64
00:10:00,012 --> 00:10:06,012
Monica Rosen: So the one good thing we in our internal team use a Google docs quite a bit in this way we can.

65
00:10:06,012 --> 00:10:11,832
Monica Rosen: If you ask somebody whenever you're doing a comment on a document you can ask them and it sends them.

66
00:10:11,832 --> 00:10:23,142
Monica Rosen: Directly an email saying hey there's a comment, and you can actually within your email, whether you want to open the document or not, you can reply back to the email and it'll put it in the actual document.

67
00:10:23,142 --> 00:10:25,002
Monica Rosen: As mentioned there's a link.

68
00:10:25,002 --> 00:10:31,962
Monica Rosen: That you can get whenever you set up your Google Doc and you can actually put that link directly into your canvas site somewhere and.

69
00:10:31,962 --> 00:10:47,382
Monica Rosen: Every year, you don't need to re upload the documents you can edit that same document every year and that link will stay there, so there's none of this like you know version 3.7 syllabus oh sorry found a little typo version 3.9.

70
00:10:47,382 --> 00:10:56,982
Monica Rosen: i'm going to upload it, you can immediately change it right there and maintain the same link, which is to me a really great feature of using Google docs.

71
00:10:56,982 --> 00:11:13,602
Monica Rosen: If you'd like to learn a little bit more, there is an actual video link, we will share these this slide presentation with you, so you can check out any of the additional resources versus we have linked on here.

72
00:11:13,602 --> 00:11:17,442
Monica Rosen: So I wanted to give you guys a little bit of an example of.

73
00:11:17,442 --> 00:11:34,572
Monica Rosen: What an interactive syllabus might look like click on here here's a just a generic syllabus template with some of the instructors information there, it looks just like a normal document and then, as you can see here if I want to I can add a comment.

74
00:11:34,572 --> 00:11:42,432
Monica Rosen: I can I right now i'm using Joanna so it looks like Joanna, but I can say hey Monica.

75
00:11:42,432 --> 00:11:54,162
Monica Rosen: I don't understand this and i'll get an email immediately that will tell me to hey can I elaborate on this, or can I edit the document so that it.

76
00:11:54,162 --> 00:12:07,722
Monica Rosen: extends a little bit more than what's on the actual document the moment if the document if the if this has been clarified or and it's been resolved, you can just check it off and then it's gone.

77
00:12:07,722 --> 00:12:15,222
Monica Rosen: And then, as mentioned whenever you share a document you click the share link.

78
00:12:15,222 --> 00:12:22,212
Monica Rosen: And then, if you want to you can change the status, though, how are you sharing it, are you sharing it with editing privileges.

79
00:12:22,212 --> 00:12:30,132
Monica Rosen: Are you sharing it only as a viewer you don't want the students to touch the document, or are you sharing it as a commenter and settled actually.

80
00:12:30,132 --> 00:12:48,342
Monica Rosen: I changed the extension of this link based on how you've modified what the privileges are so, then you can just copy the link and then you can post it wherever you'd like in your canvas site.

81
00:12:48,342 --> 00:12:51,762
Monica Rosen: If you're interested in knowing how you can copy over.

82
00:12:51,762 --> 00:13:10,002
Monica Rosen: documents we have a resource in here for some simple directions for copying over a syllabus template, but it could also be, for instance, any kind of document that you might want to set up in Google docs so the next example I want to show you guys is an interactive slides example.

83
00:13:10,002 --> 00:13:15,912
Monica Rosen: So I this came from this example came from a graduate level education course.

84
00:13:15,912 --> 00:13:24,252
Monica Rosen: Which this Professor had a set up so that there was an interactive side document for every week of the course, so I think there was 14 or 15 and total.

85
00:13:24,252 --> 00:13:29,742
Monica Rosen: The very first slide gave directions to the students for how to interact with the slides.

86
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:37,032
Monica Rosen: In this case, they had a traditional educate a traditional graduate course was that they had a couple of different readings, they had to do.

87
00:13:37,032 --> 00:13:50,202
Monica Rosen: Maybe some other interactions such as some videos to watch or an interaction with a exploration of a website and then they were to create their own slide document.

88
00:13:50,202 --> 00:13:57,882
Monica Rosen: That had a reflection of multimedia resources around the topic of that week, so in this case the week was project based learning.

89
00:13:57,882 --> 00:14:02,502
Monica Rosen: The Professor made an example side of what they thought.

90
00:14:02,502 --> 00:14:11,772
Monica Rosen: On the project based learning was to just kind of set the stage to the students about what they're going to be talking about this week, this include making being will have links to videos.

91
00:14:11,772 --> 00:14:19,542
Monica Rosen: In there as well as graphs data anything else that they'd like and then he had on the third slide this.

92
00:14:19,542 --> 00:14:26,352
Monica Rosen: Particularly only works if you have a smaller class which most of the graduate level seminar courses are a little small.

93
00:14:26,352 --> 00:14:30,822
Monica Rosen: Each of the students names up at the top, with these various category.

94
00:14:30,822 --> 00:14:39,672
Monica Rosen: Labels here, these green yellow and red dots with each of the readings listed on the left hand side or any of the engagement that they were supposed to be working on.

95
00:14:39,672 --> 00:14:46,542
Monica Rosen: And so, basically, what the students did is they gave it a green dot for any of the readings that they felt, yes, they totally jive with there's a.

96
00:14:46,542 --> 00:14:53,562
Monica Rosen: little bit of a thing down here that kind of tells them how how to use those dots are they had a positive experience with it or resonate deeply.

97
00:14:53,562 --> 00:15:03,942
Monica Rosen: With the understanding of that material the yellow dot was more neutral mixed experience and the red negative experience didn't resonate at all didn't like it didn't understand it, or something along those lines.

98
00:15:03,942 --> 00:15:13,182
Monica Rosen: So you can imagine, for the professor and both for the students this transparent ability to see how people are processing the content that they're being presented with.

99
00:15:13,182 --> 00:15:21,822
Monica Rosen: was really useful for the professor, they can decide well, maybe I should talk a little bit more about that reading or maybe I should you know ditch that reading next year.

100
00:15:21,822 --> 00:15:29,952
Monica Rosen: for students also gives them an idea, as well as how their peers were digesting the information as well, but then on the fourth slide.

101
00:15:29,952 --> 00:15:38,412
Monica Rosen: They had it an open blank slide so you can put questions in there from the students before so they had a week to complete this slide deck before they met up for there's.

102
00:15:38,412 --> 00:15:45,972
Monica Rosen: synchronous zoom session again, and so this allowed us to have an idea so like where the direction of the conversation should go into zoom session.

103
00:15:45,972 --> 00:15:56,832
Monica Rosen: And then, as mentioned each of the slide is down below was actually self created by the students, we have a couple of like you know reaching out to Microsoft kinds of.

104
00:15:56,832 --> 00:16:07,842
Monica Rosen: Pictures some videos in there as well, and then they use the notes section to actually talk about what these what these different multimedia.

105
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:18,222
Monica Rosen: meant to the content, so they basically gave some words to it, what they put on there and then during the actual zoom session they had a think pair share breakout session in the.

106
00:16:18,222 --> 00:16:27,552
Monica Rosen: In the breakout groups and which they shared with each other what their slide was meaning and then, when they came back as a major big group.

107
00:16:27,552 --> 00:16:31,572
Monica Rosen: Everybody got to discuss a little bit of their slide with each other.

108
00:16:31,572 --> 00:16:45,702
Monica Rosen: So this is just another interesting way in which you can use slides they don't have to be static powerpoints that you present to the students, but you can actually invite the students to help create the slide documents of the material.

109
00:16:45,702 --> 00:16:51,972
was born.

110
00:16:51,972 --> 00:16:59,412
Monica Rosen: Okay, so With that in mind, the first thing we're going to do is we're actually going to try this out a little bit.

111
00:16:59,412 --> 00:17:09,462
Monica Rosen: Now what other better way to understand collaboration and collaboratively and we're going to send you out to breakout rooms, to talk with your colleagues for about five to 10 minutes or so and, like you to populate.

112
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:21,462
Monica Rosen: Your group slide with keywords and multimedia, as you saw in the example regarding the theme of collaboration i'm going to put the link directly to.

113
00:17:21,462 --> 00:17:24,612
Monica Rosen: To the slide deck in the chat.

114
00:17:24,612 --> 00:17:36,252
Monica Rosen: So there it is there and then some tips there just try searching Google for Google images of the word, and it said the names are regarding collaboration.

115
00:17:36,252 --> 00:17:43,782
Joanna Kovacevich: And we're going to also going to put you in breakout rooms note when it invites you to join a breakout room.

116
00:17:43,782 --> 00:17:56,142
Joanna Kovacevich: Note the number of that breakout room and it should also be at the top, because that's going to indicate which slide you contribute to and which group you're in and there was a quick question also about.

117
00:17:56,142 --> 00:18:05,412
Joanna Kovacevich: The Google slide example collaborative deck and will we have access to those slides and, yes, that is linked in the.

118
00:18:05,412 --> 00:18:15,672
Joanna Kovacevich: slides that we can share out the presentation slides and you could make a copy of that as well, I save it to your own Google drive to sort of adapt.

119
00:18:15,672 --> 00:18:22,932
Joanna Kovacevich: Right, and these are really great these are really great examples for addressing that issue of.

120
00:18:22,932 --> 00:18:33,882
Joanna Kovacevich: Because we've been talking a lot about in zoom but this would also work well these Google suite of tools works for or in person, but we have to stay distance from one another.

121
00:18:33,882 --> 00:18:46,722
Joanna Kovacevich: Because a lot of Google products also kind of have a little chat bar off to the panel that POPs out so small groups could really be communicating over chat.

122
00:18:46,722 --> 00:19:05,982
Joanna Kovacevich: If they have laptops or tablet with them, while building a slide presentation or we're going to show another tool jam board making sort of a flip chart type display but I will just wanted to note that since it specifically came up as a.

123
00:19:05,982 --> 00:19:07,962
Joanna Kovacevich: Country concern.

124
00:19:07,962 --> 00:19:15,972
Monica Rosen: Right or even just taking some of the aspects of your course to an asynchronous aspect to it as well works offline.

125
00:19:15,972 --> 00:19:20,502
Monica Rosen: Alright, so i'm going to go ahead and open up those rooms now and maybe.

126
00:19:20,502 --> 00:19:26,005
Monica Rosen: i'll pop in and talk with you guys in a bit.

127
00:19:27,908 --> 00:19:31,988
Monica Rosen: Okay, so it looks like everybody was able to get some.

128
00:19:31,988 --> 00:19:44,768
Monica Rosen: slides populated with some items and there are pretty much kind of what we were thinking along along the lines of collaboration, this was just supposed to be kind of an example of how easy it is to set it up for the students.

129
00:19:44,768 --> 00:19:49,028
Monica Rosen: And how easy it is to participate and, as I was mentioning in one group.

130
00:19:49,028 --> 00:19:57,428
Monica Rosen: This is just another means of collaboration and the asynchronous component, you can tie this into the synchronous synchronous component of your course, but if you want to.

131
00:19:57,428 --> 00:20:09,248
Monica Rosen: You can see how the other students are engaging, which is also nice for students to see oh look I look, I see that you know katie jumped on now, you can set up, but you can have students set up their own time, for whenever if they were doing a.

132
00:20:09,248 --> 00:20:26,648
Monica Rosen: group type thing or a team type project on one slide they can set up their own time that's outside of class time to work on that slide you can also leave comments directly in the slides as well, so you can have students comment on each other's slides and give feedback that way as well.

133
00:20:26,648 --> 00:20:36,428
Monica Rosen: Today anybody else have any other questions with that activity or anything along these lines of engaging with slides in this way.

134
00:20:36,428 --> 00:20:44,378
Monica Rosen: it's pretty straightforward just another little idea and idea to add to your toolbox.

135
00:20:44,378 --> 00:20:50,348
Monica Rosen: Okay, so the next time we want to talk about was actually one that I heard.

136
00:20:50,348 --> 00:21:03,788
Monica Rosen: The Mon actually has used was jam board so jam board is basically like a whiteboard that you can add, and you can use live in your course and then you can also if you're in the in person.

137
00:21:03,788 --> 00:21:14,108
Monica Rosen: classrooms there are tablets, and some of the courses, you can actually use jam bore or two and draw directly out onto the.

138
00:21:14,108 --> 00:21:27,218
Monica Rosen: jam board, and this is especially good, for, if you have you know statistical algorithms you're writing out if you have maybe anatomy and physiology type structures, anything that may make it easier for you to write it out as your as you're lecturing.

139
00:21:27,218 --> 00:21:30,278
Monica Rosen: Some of the good features about jam board is that.

140
00:21:30,278 --> 00:21:32,588
Monica Rosen: It has a variety of viewing and editing features.

141
00:21:32,588 --> 00:21:45,578
Monica Rosen: And it can save directly into G drive and exports as a PDF image so maybe you're doing these things in your life class you got some pretty good notes and you want to save them and share them with students who weren't in the live session.

142
00:21:45,578 --> 00:21:55,838
Monica Rosen: So we'll go ahead and take a look at what jam board looks like.

143
00:21:55,838 --> 00:22:00,848
To be.

144
00:22:00,848 --> 00:22:03,368
Monica Rosen: And, did you want to.

145
00:22:03,368 --> 00:22:06,908
Monica Rosen: share that link to um I don't know if you shared that in the chat so everything.

146
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:07,508
Joanna Kovacevich: aside and just.

147
00:22:07,508 --> 00:22:11,648
Joanna Kovacevich: put that in the chat in case anyone wants to jump over there.

148
00:22:11,648 --> 00:22:17,648
Monica Rosen: You can see what that's like feel free to do use any of the features on this jam or that you.

149
00:22:17,648 --> 00:22:25,478
Monica Rosen: like just to see what it looks like if you use the pen you can draw directly on there, you can erase them.

150
00:22:25,478 --> 00:22:29,318
Monica Rosen: You can also add sticky notes in there.

151
00:22:29,318 --> 00:22:43,538
Monica Rosen: You can put images directly in there as well, you could set it up so that maybe you have some type of template that you want to use and that they're drawing on the template so perhaps like an anatomy structure and you're going in there and labeling things or describing it that way.

152
00:22:43,538 --> 00:22:48,218
Monica Rosen: there's also a really cool like it's basically like the laser pointer so it leaves a trail.

153
00:22:48,218 --> 00:22:56,558
Monica Rosen: But immediately disappear, so you can just kind of follow along one of the things you'll notice up here is it's one of three, but this is.

154
00:22:56,558 --> 00:23:06,638
Monica Rosen: One of three different jam boards that are in one group piece so, for instance, you can add in here what's your favorite season students could add their sticky note.

155
00:23:06,638 --> 00:23:22,868
Monica Rosen: which I think you know we go i'm going to say fall i'm from Florida, where we don't have seasonal changes so fall is always really nice for me, but you know you could add this is an open Oh, it looks like Brian says he's not seeing the tools.

156
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:32,288
Joanna Kovacevich: Let me make sure that there is edit ability.

157
00:23:32,288 --> 00:23:39,218
Joanna Kovacevich: Alright i'm going to post a new link that's going to have flash edit in the URL.

158
00:23:39,218 --> 00:23:40,688
Joanna Kovacevich: it's.

159
00:23:40,688 --> 00:23:43,208
Brian Zikmund-Fisher: It works if you just reload the page now.

160
00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:50,588
Joanna Kovacevich: Oh, probably get if you refresh your screen, now that I reset the share tool sorry about that.

161
00:23:50,588 --> 00:23:53,588
Monica Rosen: That happens.

162
00:23:53,588 --> 00:24:11,648
Monica Rosen: um we have another one in here, and you can have graph paper on there if it makes sense, you know draw our little normal distribution, it might make sense to you know have some cut type of graph paper in there there's just a lot of different things, you can do with jam board.

163
00:24:11,648 --> 00:24:13,538
Monica Rosen: I was just kind of.

164
00:24:13,538 --> 00:24:23,348
Monica Rosen: curious Simone I know that you had said that you used jam board in your course did you want to share how you might have used it or how you had students interact with it i'm just going to curious.

165
00:24:23,348 --> 00:24:34,118
Simone Singh: yeah I wasn't even thinking about this part, but the grass, which would work for my course as well, but I just used it in the beginning of each session for my coursera course to ask questions to have students have.

166
00:24:34,118 --> 00:24:36,788
Simone Singh: write down the questions about the material so.

167
00:24:36,788 --> 00:24:48,338
Simone Singh: I like that it was an all in one place and I liked it was anonymous so people felt more comfortable I thought, asking questions because it wasn't like I have to speak up, I have to like out myself as someone who didn't understand certain concepts so.

168
00:24:48,338 --> 00:24:58,268
Simone Singh: I basically just use that first i'm like what you had for like what's your favorite season that kind of set up and just have people put sticky notes with the with the questions.

169
00:24:58,268 --> 00:25:00,098
Monica Rosen: yep.

170
00:25:00,098 --> 00:25:12,308
Joanna Kovacevich: And one note i'm guessing it was anonymous because they maybe weren't logged in to a Google drive account they were just accessing it where it kind of lets you be anonymous and effect, it gives you weird anonymous names.

171
00:25:12,308 --> 00:25:21,788
Joanna Kovacevich: But one thing I wanted to touch on to back what Monica mentioned about using it with a tablet next week we're going to be talking about classroom recording with pinup dough.

172
00:25:21,788 --> 00:25:37,208
Joanna Kovacevich: And when, and so I just mentioned it as a alternative to using a whiteboard behind you, so that those things can be captured for any students who will be viewing your class asynchronously.

173
00:25:37,208 --> 00:25:54,938
Joanna Kovacevich: If you have your class has students, that will be participating remotely, this is a good option, and all of the SP ah classrooms have tablets screens and we're going to cover that in that panel session next week.

174
00:25:54,938 --> 00:25:58,268
Monica Rosen: I think there are also something like.

175
00:25:58,268 --> 00:26:05,438
Monica Rosen: dashboard within the zoom session that when we get to the zoom section i'll talk about if you need simpler tools that you can do something.

176
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:12,698
Monica Rosen: Similar on zoom session ones, but let's go ahead and head back and look at some of the other stuff again, as I mentioned there's a.

177
00:26:12,698 --> 00:26:28,388
Monica Rosen: We posted a link to a beginners tutorial like 14 minutes, but I think that what we showed you is pretty straightforward and then again if you ever want to come back to this and play out on our jam board just to see how that looks like feel free to do so.

178
00:26:28,388 --> 00:26:30,848
Simone Singh: I have a quick question the next.

179
00:26:30,848 --> 00:26:43,868
Simone Singh: sentence okay about the whiteboard idea, so when I taught before I often had a you know, like, I had a typical like on a whiteboard like I had something to draw on as the instructor like a screen or something.

180
00:26:43,868 --> 00:26:57,788
Simone Singh: But when i'm doing it from home obviously don't have to do, technology, so you think the jamboree this graph paper is the best the next best thing to having an actual you know screen, you could draw on.

181
00:26:57,788 --> 00:27:00,218
Monica Rosen: pleasing Joanna.

182
00:27:00,218 --> 00:27:03,848
Joanna Kovacevich: I think it is.

183
00:27:03,848 --> 00:27:12,428
Joanna Kovacevich: depends on the resources, you have we do, we may actually have tablets that can be loaned out if you are teaching remotely.

184
00:27:12,428 --> 00:27:17,858
Joanna Kovacevich: So that may be something to contact us pH dot help about.

185
00:27:17,858 --> 00:27:25,868
Joanna Kovacevich: Checking out one of those because it's really going to help you demonstrate those things that you by hand that you might do on the whiteboard.

186
00:27:25,868 --> 00:27:40,898
Joanna Kovacevich: or even with a document camera if you are in person, and so it really is about trying to make that is easy to capture and the nice thing about doing an agenda to is that is then save in your Google drive and can be shared.

187
00:27:40,898 --> 00:27:45,848
Joanna Kovacevich: So I do think that works well, if you have a.

188
00:27:45,848 --> 00:27:52,958
Joanna Kovacevich: yeah any tablet with a stylist if you have one or yeah check to see about a loner mm hmm.

189
00:27:52,958 --> 00:27:56,528
Monica Rosen: You know, there was this actually reminds me of.

190
00:27:56,528 --> 00:28:04,328
Monica Rosen: One other thing that I wanted to mention with the jam board, it was that they also has a running version history, as mentioned here, so one of the.

191
00:28:04,328 --> 00:28:14,318
Monica Rosen: You know, fears that we have at least leaving this up to the students as maybe they'll go on there, and actually delete everything, so you can actually recover, if I can get on there.

192
00:28:14,318 --> 00:28:15,128
Monica Rosen: i've gotta.

193
00:28:15,128 --> 00:28:16,208
Joanna Kovacevich: Let me.

194
00:28:16,208 --> 00:28:18,878
Monica Rosen: yeah can you click on the thing up there.

195
00:28:18,878 --> 00:28:26,108
Monica Rosen: But yeah there's a document there, so, as you can see down here on the see version history.

196
00:28:26,108 --> 00:28:35,918
Monica Rosen: We can always restore something if a student excellent goes in there, and you know, maybe does something you know, on by accident and we can actually restore it.

197
00:28:35,918 --> 00:28:47,258
Monica Rosen: To the diversion before then so that's really nice because it's just ongoing memory that's happening with jam board as well.

198
00:28:47,258 --> 00:28:58,688
Monica Rosen: OK so moving on to the next tool, this is a pretty popular tool, maybe some of you guys are using it, I know that there's many in the nutrition department, right now, who have kind of signed on to wanting to use perusal.

199
00:28:58,688 --> 00:29:06,758
Monica Rosen: But perusal is, as I mentioned a collaborative social annotation E reader i'm gonna get a couple of resources here, but you and I made a great.

200
00:29:06,758 --> 00:29:16,538
Monica Rosen: handout and instructor guide and for you guys to follow along but, basically, this is what perusal will look like i'll show you an actual going into perusal, but this is what the general.

201
00:29:16,538 --> 00:29:29,948
Monica Rosen: User interface kind of looks like you would upload documents, so we have this tab will be here, this is for an actual class and you upload the documents of the different readings and then, as you can see there there's a comment or conversation going on the.

202
00:29:29,948 --> 00:29:36,428
Monica Rosen: Other right hand panel with the initials for each of the different students, they can highlight pieces and add comments and questions into it.

203
00:29:36,428 --> 00:29:45,428
Monica Rosen: And one of the interesting things is you can they can start to add hashtags as well, so certain themes that they think that are coming across within the.

204
00:29:45,428 --> 00:29:51,578
Monica Rosen: Reading and perusal actually you can use it for graded or underrated options.

205
00:29:51,578 --> 00:30:04,118
Monica Rosen: So, with the graded component of perusal it has an Ai algorithm built into it, that the students have to engage with it, so much so that is, they have to spend so much time reading it, they can't just quickly scroll through it all.

206
00:30:04,118 --> 00:30:16,658
Monica Rosen: They have to you know leave a certain length of description comments on the perusal on the actual reading and then it generates a engagement type of school.

207
00:30:16,658 --> 00:30:24,398
Monica Rosen: Or, and one of the great things about perusal is it does link directly into your canvas site, so we can actually push the grades directly to your gradebook.

208
00:30:24,398 --> 00:30:38,858
Monica Rosen: I know that Dave bridges uses the great component or perusal and then other some faculty members aren't using the graded aspect at all they're just using it as another asynchronous way of engaging with a reading.

209
00:30:38,858 --> 00:30:53,228
Monica Rosen: As mentioned you normally people who have been using it for pdfs and, but you can also upload docs web pages and video links as well, and you can do this in a class wide so every student can engage with the same PDF or you can actually allocate students as small groups.

210
00:30:53,228 --> 00:30:57,638
Monica Rosen: And maybe they have different readings, or you just want to keep the conversations in a smaller group.

211
00:30:57,638 --> 00:31:12,698
Monica Rosen: As mentioned it's graded it has a default grade algorithm in there, or you can actually customize that grading option so maybe you want it to be a little bit differently than what's in there, or an upgraded version, and as I also said, it does not have an LTE is.

212
00:31:12,698 --> 00:31:23,018
Monica Rosen: It can directly integrate into campus so i'll show you an example assignment, if you are in our resilient teaching canvas site um you would be able to find it there as well.

213
00:31:23,018 --> 00:31:31,808
Monica Rosen: So we will load the approvals assignment in a new window and if you wanted to Would you mind, adding that link in there as well, Joanna.

214
00:31:31,808 --> 00:31:33,728
Joanna Kovacevich: yeah i'm going to interfere with your mouse.

215
00:31:33,728 --> 00:31:42,998
Joanna Kovacevich: Control one second if you can sorry we're sharing mouse control and zoom, which is something we haven't done before.

216
00:31:42,998 --> 00:31:48,338
Joanna Kovacevich: It works great unless you're both trying to do things in zoom at the same time okay it's back.

217
00:31:48,338 --> 00:31:56,468
Monica Rosen: Okay So here we have a reading that's uploaded.

218
00:31:56,468 --> 00:32:03,938
Monica Rosen: uses social annotation platforms for pre class readings and we can see there's been some highlighting is already in here somebody testing it out.

219
00:32:03,938 --> 00:32:22,418
Monica Rosen: Leaving some comments in there, we could chat with her back again there's a full ability to put in different types of texts in there, they could write out some algorithms that they wanted lead emojis add an image or link out to other relevant topics as well.

220
00:32:22,418 --> 00:32:34,598
Monica Rosen: um right, and so you can even also add sections so like perhaps maybe there's a graph or an image in there and they can actually select the image as well.

221
00:32:34,598 --> 00:32:39,278
Monica Rosen: So we here up here somebody is selected the image.

222
00:32:39,278 --> 00:32:47,588
Monica Rosen: What is happening here, so this is just another again the tool in your toolbox that you can add, we have the library, this is our the different.

223
00:32:47,588 --> 00:33:01,268
Monica Rosen: articles that this course that our courses resilient teaching has added to our library, and if you had assignments that were assigned to it, you want them to engage with it so much, then you can do so there.

224
00:33:01,268 --> 00:33:05,798
Joanna Kovacevich: are a couple of quick notes, if you don't mind i'd like to add, so this.

225
00:33:05,798 --> 00:33:16,388
Joanna Kovacevich: You can see the actual reading itself in the way my browser setup is extremely small but, at the top of the screen, there are different view options students can take this full screen.

226
00:33:16,388 --> 00:33:28,028
Joanna Kovacevich: When you upload documents you can give students be available, the ability to download them so they can read them offline and then maybe come back after the fact, and annotate and add comments.

227
00:33:28,028 --> 00:33:46,058
Joanna Kovacevich: And then there is the ability for them to hide all of these highlights and comments, giving them an opportunity to read through the document first and then go back and re enable the highlights and conversations and then begin to contribute so there's a lot of flexibility.

228
00:33:46,058 --> 00:33:48,968
Joanna Kovacevich: On there additionally.

229
00:33:48,968 --> 00:33:56,138
Joanna Kovacevich: you'll know if you see right here, you sort of see my profile picture in a bubble on the left.

230
00:33:56,138 --> 00:34:09,098
Joanna Kovacevich: If you if we were doing this synchronously you would see the bubbles of everyone else who happens to be in the document live, so if it were a collaborative activity that you were doing in an in person class.

231
00:34:09,098 --> 00:34:14,828
Joanna Kovacevich: Everyone would be in there, working together, and you would see them off to the side.

232
00:34:14,828 --> 00:34:25,268
Monica Rosen: And we also have our directions for this actual reading assignment that's popping up here it's reminding the students exactly what is expected of them for this reading.

233
00:34:25,268 --> 00:34:35,318
Monica Rosen: complete the reading and share three thoughts, you have an upload up vote at least two questions or comments shared by your peers.

234
00:34:35,318 --> 00:34:43,748
Monica Rosen: Before we move on to the next tool, are there any questions regarding Peru is all.

235
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:48,038
OK.

236
00:34:48,038 --> 00:34:55,508
Monica Rosen: So, again, there are a lot of other features in perusal if you ever wanted to learn more about it in depth just feel free to reach out to us.

237
00:34:55,508 --> 00:35:07,058
Monica Rosen: Or you can always use this link and keep playing around that's not open to anybody else just faculty members feel free to use any comments that you want with the actual example assignment.

238
00:35:07,058 --> 00:35:10,748
Monica Rosen: So now we'll go ahead and turn it over to Joanna who will talk to.

239
00:35:10,748 --> 00:35:14,018
Monica Rosen: You about poll everywhere.

240
00:35:14,018 --> 00:35:16,178
Joanna Kovacevich: Alright, so poll everywhere, is a.

241
00:35:16,178 --> 00:35:35,648
Joanna Kovacevich: tool that is licensed specifically by the School of Public Health and when, if you were to sign up for a free account or maybe you have a free account, we would want to make sure we add you to the School of Public Health license giving you access to more features and reporting.

242
00:35:35,648 --> 00:35:51,008
Joanna Kovacevich: And what it is, is a tool to create poll questions for your class and we know the good strategic use of poll questions can help you assess your students understanding on topics, or even alyssa ideas for a brainstorm.

243
00:35:51,008 --> 00:35:59,828
Joanna Kovacevich: And it's going to create opportunities to hear from students that may not be comfortable speaking up in front of the class.

244
00:35:59,828 --> 00:36:09,188
Joanna Kovacevich: So you can set questions up to have a canvas grade book column associated with them.

245
00:36:09,188 --> 00:36:15,788
Joanna Kovacevich: In the resources i'm going to share out there is a quick registration step to do in your canvas site.

246
00:36:15,788 --> 00:36:28,148
Joanna Kovacevich: to sort of get your students connect the gradebook their canvas identity with a poll everywhere account that they would need to log into to respond to questions, but then you're going to be able to port.

247
00:36:28,148 --> 00:36:37,148
Joanna Kovacevich: Those scores, and that participation back over to your grade book and get a sense of who participated and who didn't.

248
00:36:37,148 --> 00:36:52,358
Joanna Kovacevich: But then you can also set questions up to be anonymous So if you really want to talk about maybe sensitive subjects in the class or allow students to give feedback on something anonymously, you can do that as well.

249
00:36:52,358 --> 00:36:58,688
Joanna Kovacevich: You can ask questions that have a correct answer or simply pull for thoughts and ideas.

250
00:36:58,688 --> 00:37:13,478
Joanna Kovacevich: So in the examples we had in the beginning, those were both one of them was a multiple choice, but there wasn't a correct answer it was simply a survey and then the other one was open ended where you could sort of type your.

251
00:37:13,478 --> 00:37:19,538
Joanna Kovacevich: Type your own responses and thoughts.

252
00:37:19,538 --> 00:37:27,458
Joanna Kovacevich: You can present from the Web or integrate with other tools, so the survey, I had.

253
00:37:27,458 --> 00:37:41,918
Joanna Kovacevich: presented at the beginning of this training I integrate use the Google slide integration with poll everywhere, so that I don't have to jump to another website to get it to work I just need to click through my slides and it activates automatically.

254
00:37:41,918 --> 00:38:02,108
Joanna Kovacevich: There are integrations with PowerPoint and keynote and also with slack so if For those of you that teach in the online program you can drop poll everywhere questions into your slack channel and get responses that way.

255
00:38:02,108 --> 00:38:05,738
Joanna Kovacevich: You can.

256
00:38:05,738 --> 00:38:15,968
Joanna Kovacevich: So some benefits of using this in a remote or in person, setting is that it's incorporated into your tools, but you can also create a team.

257
00:38:15,968 --> 00:38:26,618
Joanna Kovacevich: so that you can share questions and questions sets with colleagues your teaching team and GS eyes, so in the scenario that.

258
00:38:26,618 --> 00:38:36,038
Joanna Kovacevich: You have a lecture section and then several discussion sections, you can build questions that each of your dsi can use in their discussion sections.

259
00:38:36,038 --> 00:38:44,648
Joanna Kovacevich: But all of those reports will be under your account, and you can kind of see how everyone did across all those sections.

260
00:38:44,648 --> 00:38:54,458
Joanna Kovacevich: And then you're going to be able to reuse your questions and so when we use zoom polls, those are really neat and you can use those in.

261
00:38:54,458 --> 00:39:02,048
Joanna Kovacevich: There she took ways, but you can't copy and reuse those in a different zoom meeting you have to reuse the same.

262
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:21,668
Joanna Kovacevich: zoom meeting to get those so you can sort of use them from year to year Semester to semester, or maybe you set up an exit ticket type question at the end of your classes and you can reuse that every week.

263
00:39:21,668 --> 00:39:25,508
Joanna Kovacevich: Right so.

264
00:39:25,508 --> 00:39:30,938
Joanna Kovacevich: So I have this set of resources here and I just wanted to.

265
00:39:30,938 --> 00:39:35,228
Joanna Kovacevich: Show you if you have used poll everywhere before.

266
00:39:35,228 --> 00:39:41,648
Joanna Kovacevich: There have been some interface changes, so I just wanted to jump briefly over to my account.

267
00:39:41,648 --> 00:39:48,488
Joanna Kovacevich: And this shows me all of the any of the folders which have a groups of questions.

268
00:39:48,488 --> 00:40:00,068
Joanna Kovacevich: or any just loose poll everywhere polls that I have created and so i've created a set of questions and examples for this workshop and here's where they all are.

269
00:40:00,068 --> 00:40:10,418
Joanna Kovacevich: I can go ahead and deactivate that and I can add new activities and this gives you a quick look at the interface the multiple choice.

270
00:40:10,418 --> 00:40:33,518
Joanna Kovacevich: The word cloud, which we see used as Monica mentioned at the speech town halls Q amp a meaning, everyone can respond with an open ended answer, but people can also give a thumbs up to other people's responses i've saved like oh yeah I I felt that way to or I think that's a good idea.

271
00:40:33,518 --> 00:40:43,448
Joanna Kovacevich: clickable image response, this is tricky if you have students who have visual impairment, but this could be an example of there is a.

272
00:40:43,448 --> 00:40:54,308
Joanna Kovacevich: Country map and mark where you're from or a pain scale of how how's your first week going or how was that first exam how's everyone feeling about that first exam.

273
00:40:54,308 --> 00:41:04,388
Monica Rosen: I would also probably add that you can upload your own images to there so like, for instance in anatomy types of things, you can have them labeling that way as well.

274
00:41:04,388 --> 00:41:07,418
Joanna Kovacevich: that's absolutely right in the survey.

275
00:41:07,418 --> 00:41:12,518
Joanna Kovacevich: This is where you can set up multiple questions that students can answer one right after another.

276
00:41:12,518 --> 00:41:18,008
Joanna Kovacevich: As opposed to just responding to one question at a time.

277
00:41:18,008 --> 00:41:22,478
Joanna Kovacevich: An open ended question and competition is interesting.

278
00:41:22,478 --> 00:41:41,168
Joanna Kovacevich: You know, for the right class if there's sort of an exam review this could be a fun sort of quiz Bible type experience, where poll everywhere is keeping track of who answered correctly and how fast and it creates a leaderboard of students or maybe even teams.

279
00:41:41,168 --> 00:41:49,778
Joanna Kovacevich: They can be fun and interactive.

280
00:41:49,778 --> 00:42:02,858
Joanna Kovacevich: The next tool, I want to talk about is yellow dig, it is a newish tool which also is unique, just to School of Public Health, this is integrated into canvas so it's ready to use.

281
00:42:02,858 --> 00:42:13,988
Joanna Kovacevich: And also links into your gradebook So this is the student driven social network based in an educational setting and so social network.

282
00:42:13,988 --> 00:42:31,508
Joanna Kovacevich: makes me think of i'm posting an idea i'm posting a picture i'm linking to an article that I liked or that's relevant to maybe what we talked about in class last week, and here it is showing up in the news and then.

283
00:42:31,508 --> 00:42:38,678
Joanna Kovacevich: Other students can leave comments or even emoji reactions have a thumbs up or like.

284
00:42:38,678 --> 00:42:52,298
Joanna Kovacevich: and students are going to be earning points for these interactions throughout the Semester, so they earn points when they create their own post they earn points when they leave a comment.

285
00:42:52,298 --> 00:42:56,018
Joanna Kovacevich: But they also earn points when.

286
00:42:56,018 --> 00:43:11,138
Joanna Kovacevich: Other students leave comments and reactions on something they posted so it's almost like a row board system for posting something of quality or something that generated discussion and interaction.

287
00:43:11,138 --> 00:43:27,758
Joanna Kovacevich: And so, this lends itself to large and small classes, if you use weekly discussions, there is a point system that resets each week and so students are trying to meet a certain goal each week or there is.

288
00:43:27,758 --> 00:43:46,898
Joanna Kovacevich: New this year is a free form points system where they just earn towards a goal for the entire semester, and then at the end of the term, this translates and posts back to your gradebook as one discussion or participation grade.

289
00:43:46,898 --> 00:43:49,358
Joanna Kovacevich: And so great types of.

290
00:43:49,358 --> 00:44:02,138
Joanna Kovacevich: conversation starters, to use in yellow dig are open ended prompts with many possible responses and interpretations, you could think of student Journal and blog posts.

291
00:44:02,138 --> 00:44:20,198
Joanna Kovacevich: We did a class in the online program that had a simulation component where students needed to become a role take on a role and communicate in that role, and we ended up using yellow dig for that.

292
00:44:20,198 --> 00:44:28,388
Joanna Kovacevich: So I thought the best way to get started, just to see it if you haven't seen it yet is to jump right in.

293
00:44:28,388 --> 00:44:32,678
Joanna Kovacevich: Again, this is a.

294
00:44:32,678 --> 00:44:40,778
Joanna Kovacevich: Practice assignment just created for the purpose of instructor practice and seeing what the tool looks like.

295
00:44:40,778 --> 00:44:52,538
Joanna Kovacevich: And so I have this setup as an assignment, which is how you would do it in your canvas site, if you scroll down to the bottom of this page and load yellow dig community in a new window.

296
00:44:52,538 --> 00:45:05,318
Joanna Kovacevich: You may 1 see an account setup step, where you just enter in your name, but this is what the Community looks like once you are in.

297
00:45:05,318 --> 00:45:16,568
Joanna Kovacevich: And so here is the initial pinned post, this was sort of the welcome from when the Community was created, and this pin post always remains at the top.

298
00:45:16,568 --> 00:45:23,378
Joanna Kovacevich: But as I scroll down, I can see what other items people have added.

299
00:45:23,378 --> 00:45:36,518
Joanna Kovacevich: And so here Monica has added a post that has a link referenced to it, and she has a poll that she's asked.

300
00:45:36,518 --> 00:45:40,028
Joanna Kovacevich: That you can respond to.

301
00:45:40,028 --> 00:45:47,048
Joanna Kovacevich: Over on the right, I can create all Members can create a post.

302
00:45:47,048 --> 00:45:54,338
Joanna Kovacevich: search and filter posts because, again, this is going to be a single scrolling feed for the whole semester.

303
00:45:54,338 --> 00:46:03,218
Joanna Kovacevich: And then here, you can see, I can track my own personal points on how i'm doing towards the Semester long goal, this is an example of the.

304
00:46:03,218 --> 00:46:23,438
Joanna Kovacevich: Free form points, but right below that I can see how to earn points i'll be able to say you know all right in this group what Oh, what do I need to do to get to the goal and i'll be able to see what I need to do and how many points I can earn for each type of interaction.

305
00:46:23,438 --> 00:46:34,298
Joanna Kovacevich: So here, I can, if I receive a comment from another user I can earn 55 points and, if I can receive a reaction and so that creates a motivation to.

306
00:46:34,298 --> 00:46:49,988
Joanna Kovacevich: create a post that generates comments that other students will see a value or maybe even as part of my post inviting students to contribute something to that just outright.

307
00:46:49,988 --> 00:47:01,508
Joanna Kovacevich: And so, then helping me, you know earn points from getting other people to interact with my post.

308
00:47:01,508 --> 00:47:09,098
Joanna Kovacevich: um so feel free to comment, and so I can leave responses here.

309
00:47:09,098 --> 00:47:17,138
Joanna Kovacevich: Or, I can just leave any type of emoji reaction.

310
00:47:17,138 --> 00:47:30,908
Monica Rosen: I would probably go ad that you can actually situate certain conversations around topics to that's right so there's a variety of topics that you can create perhaps this week, your it's all on one area we put a couple of.

311
00:47:30,908 --> 00:47:41,288
Monica Rosen: different topics in there in the news, or you know accessibility Community info but you could create whatever topics, you want so students could then just tag.

312
00:47:41,288 --> 00:47:52,448
Monica Rosen: Their post regarding whatever topic, whether it's week one information or a specific area, you can you can filter the information that way as well.

313
00:47:52,448 --> 00:48:04,298
Joanna Kovacevich: yeah it would be great to go, and you can modify these tasks tags and create one for each of the topics she'll be addressing in your class so that students can organize their posts in that way.

314
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:15,098
Joanna Kovacevich: You see, the hashtags here and, as these get created these become another search and fill trouble item.

315
00:48:15,098 --> 00:48:20,648
Monica Rosen: So, again that's open up to you guys anytime you want feel free to play with.

316
00:48:20,648 --> 00:48:28,988
Monica Rosen: It any of its features only lets faculty and staff can actually see that were in that group.

317
00:48:28,988 --> 00:48:31,478
Joanna Kovacevich: And so, this.

318
00:48:31,478 --> 00:48:41,738
Joanna Kovacevich: translates to just a single yellow dig participation grade in your grade book but they're going to be there are lots of reports in the yellow dig platform.

319
00:48:41,738 --> 00:48:49,208
Joanna Kovacevich: That give you a sense as the instructor of how much your students are participating, a lot of them are going to show you.

320
00:48:49,208 --> 00:49:03,008
Joanna Kovacevich: Reports in terms of points how they're doing and how they earn those points, but this is one example of a network graph which gives you a visual of how your students are participating.

321
00:49:03,008 --> 00:49:12,308
Joanna Kovacevich: The image on the Left was a snapshot taken in a class at the beginning of the Semester, as they were just getting in to the yellow dig community.

322
00:49:12,308 --> 00:49:25,568
Joanna Kovacevich: And so you can see all the profile pictures, maybe have one or two arrows going to or from them and they're very spaced out along the top just to.

323
00:49:25,568 --> 00:49:32,858
Joanna Kovacevich: create a to help with the visualization I pulled out students that had not yet interacted.

324
00:49:32,858 --> 00:49:46,838
Joanna Kovacevich: And so they've they've gone into yellow did they sort of activated their account but they hadn't made a post yet and they hadn't commented on anything anyone had posted so they didn't have any lines going to or from their profile.

325
00:49:46,838 --> 00:50:07,838
Joanna Kovacevich: jump ahead to the end of the course and you can see, they really became this really tight web of arrows, and this is basically just a visual representation of how much they were commenting and interacting with one another and then there are few students who were sort of outliers.

326
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:18,218
Joanna Kovacevich: But what it does, is it it'll show you whether is everyone just interacting with me the instructor or are they talking to one another and discussing these topics.

327
00:50:18,218 --> 00:50:32,168
Joanna Kovacevich: And, in fact, in this case the instructor is the one on the far left she chose to sort of keep herself out and let the students work on their project and their discussions collaborations together.

328
00:50:32,168 --> 00:50:38,558
Joanna Kovacevich: And so, she has very little interaction she's the one on the left with it looks like a flag is behind her.

329
00:50:38,558 --> 00:50:42,488
Monica Rosen: That was actually Dr Sharon Kar Diya.

330
00:50:42,488 --> 00:50:55,988
Monica Rosen: it's mentioned she had done that role playing simulation so all of the profile pictures of these students are generic profiles of like the roles that they were playing so they changed their profile to match who their character was for the simulation.

331
00:50:55,988 --> 00:50:57,458
Monica Rosen: that's right and.

332
00:50:57,458 --> 00:51:07,508
Joanna Kovacevich: So just a little bit of feedback that we've gotten phila danville Illinois in ehs in nutritional science she used it in the winter semester.

333
00:51:07,508 --> 00:51:26,378
Joanna Kovacevich: And thought that you'll dig facilitated back and forth conversation and sharing of articles and websites, creating a sense of community during the week in between those class meetings, and it also allowed her to reinforce concepts course concepts that had been discussed in yellow dig.

334
00:51:26,378 --> 00:51:34,208
Joanna Kovacevich: And then sharon's feedback on using the tool for that simulation and we have selected that she was using this.

335
00:51:34,208 --> 00:51:48,338
Joanna Kovacevich: tool and this simulation exercise to formulate multi sector collaboration that support population health improvement, so there were very specific things that she needed from a discussion tool and.

336
00:51:48,338 --> 00:51:57,938
Joanna Kovacevich: You know her thought was that yellow did really was a game changer for that exercise it created a vehicle for students to be able to take their roles into action.

337
00:51:57,938 --> 00:52:07,118
Joanna Kovacevich: and students, especially enjoyed the different multimedia posting options and we didn't go into this, but I can when I create a post.

338
00:52:07,118 --> 00:52:20,648
Joanna Kovacevich: I can upload images, I can upload I can record a 92nd video so as you're thinking of thinking of maybe having students introduce themselves in a class that's one way they can do it.

339
00:52:20,648 --> 00:52:26,408
Joanna Kovacevich: With a tool that's integrated directly into canvas.

340
00:52:26,408 --> 00:52:36,968
Joanna Kovacevich: And so, as with the other tools, I have a resources page here you'll dig video from the little company that provides a brief overview.

341
00:52:36,968 --> 00:52:49,328
Joanna Kovacevich: We have a link to a training session, and then a handout of getting started with yellow dig of how to actually set this up in your own canvas site.

342
00:52:49,328 --> 00:52:56,558
Monica Rosen: I would probably add one more thing, and that is like Why would you want to use yellow dig versus a discussion board like.

343
00:52:56,558 --> 00:53:07,718
Monica Rosen: Like if it kind of basically does the same thing, and that is mainly they don't really do the same thing, where the discussion board post is the instructor creates the discussion you just you put the question and this.

344
00:53:07,718 --> 00:53:13,238
Monica Rosen: Student answers that and normally what you'll end up noticing is that students will do the bare minimum they'll do their post and replied to.

345
00:53:13,238 --> 00:53:22,478
Monica Rosen: It doesn't normally seem like it's actually normal natural conversation that's happening around the topic yellow digs a little bit more of the instructor taking a step back, they kind.

346
00:53:22,478 --> 00:53:25,718
Monica Rosen: Of add an idea, perhaps, maybe you're engaged with the.

347
00:53:25,718 --> 00:53:45,188
Monica Rosen: Community and perhaps you're not but it's student driven so allows for more natural modern types of online conversation to facilitate and you just generally see more engagement with the yellow data platform versus the discussion board.

348
00:53:45,188 --> 00:53:58,808
Monica Rosen: Alright, so the last section we're going to talk about is zoom so we'll try to go a little bit quickly over this one, because I think that many of you are pretty pretty good pretty equivalent with zoom, especially since everything that's happened lately.

349
00:53:58,808 --> 00:54:06,008
Monica Rosen: So we'll talk about some of the newest fun features again video conferencing program that fosters both large and small group discussions it.

350
00:54:06,008 --> 00:54:18,638
Monica Rosen: doesn't necessarily have to be a purely passive activity for students, there are actually engagement tools such as the breakout rooms and some of the other tools available and zoom we have a couple of resources there for you.

351
00:54:18,638 --> 00:54:27,758
Monica Rosen: As mentioned, as well as a one that we, we have a topic in here running effective zoom sessions based off some of the past.

352
00:54:27,758 --> 00:54:38,768
Monica Rosen: Online courses that have run in from student feedback, who have said yeah these these zoom sessions, where especially good we've tried to accumulate some of those tips and put those in there for you guys to.

353
00:54:38,768 --> 00:54:52,418
Monica Rosen: share so some of the newest features are the immersive view and the PowerPoint as virtual background isn't completely new but it's an unknown feature, most people are not aware of that one which.

354
00:54:52,418 --> 00:54:54,698
Monica Rosen: A lot of instructors actually like that one quite a bit.

355
00:54:54,698 --> 00:55:07,958
Monica Rosen: But let's talk about the immersive view real quick, so the immersive view is this is our team actually demoing it, you have a background that actually looks kind of like a room there's probably 10 or 15 or so different backgrounds.

356
00:55:07,958 --> 00:55:18,728
Monica Rosen: It can only work up to 25 participants in the most important thing is that every student needs to have the most up to date zoom APP for them to participate, they won't see.

357
00:55:18,728 --> 00:55:28,298
Monica Rosen: If they try to turn the immersive view on they want people to see what else is saying they can still watch you lecture but they won't be able to participate in the same way.

358
00:55:28,298 --> 00:55:32,438
Monica Rosen: But basically, it creates a background, and you can actually move people around.

359
00:55:32,438 --> 00:55:42,938
Monica Rosen: I could actually click on each of these people and put them in different chairs, if I wanted, they can up boat, or you know you can put a little quiz in there, and you can see the responses from each.

360
00:55:42,938 --> 00:56:00,278
Monica Rosen: person in there and there's different sized rooms, that they can do so, they have small pairs, for instance, we have right Drake here, and one of our graphic designers in a more cozy intimate group scenario, or we have a larger modern looking classroom as well.

361
00:56:00,278 --> 00:56:10,178
Monica Rosen: We have some directions for on how to enable it if you're interested in looking at that again you'll have to have the most latest version of zoom for it to work.

362
00:56:10,178 --> 00:56:20,438
Monica Rosen: And then the other option is the PowerPoint as a virtual background, which i'm going to show you guys what that kind of looks like because this is a not necessarily mean that the students have to be the most up to date.

363
00:56:20,438 --> 00:56:29,048
Monica Rosen: For it to work, only the instructor who's using it needs to be up to date, so what you would basically do as you can see, we have a an example.

364
00:56:29,048 --> 00:56:54,578
Monica Rosen: posted screen shot of Joanna using a background, as her virtual image is you're going to go to the screen share options and then click the advanced button so i'm going to do that real quick, so you can kind of see what that looks like.

365
00:56:54,578 --> 00:57:03,068
Joanna Kovacevich: One really nice benefit of of that I like about this is that when typically when when you're in screen share mode, you know we get that our.

366
00:57:03,068 --> 00:57:11,588
Joanna Kovacevich: panel turns into the floating toolbar, which is often sometimes in our way and it's harder to locate your chat and things like that.

367
00:57:11,588 --> 00:57:28,748
Joanna Kovacevich: That actually kind of eliminates that and so, if you're presenting a PowerPoint from a file saved on your computer you get to keep that toolbar at the bottom and you get to keep your chat in the side panel so that's sort of a nice benefit to that.

368
00:57:28,748 --> 00:57:33,218
Monica Rosen: So I just have some generic U of m slides here.

369
00:57:33,218 --> 00:57:38,738
Monica Rosen: But, as you can see here's my background here I am I can move myself around within the screen.

370
00:57:38,738 --> 00:57:48,848
Monica Rosen: And I can actually make myself larger or smaller put myself wherever I want this might be especially nice if you like, to play the weatherman and you know point to things that you're watching.

371
00:57:48,848 --> 00:58:01,448
Monica Rosen: And these are whole group of slides in there, so I can move around to the next, slides and if there's texts in the way I can always move myself over to another side and continue on this could be a fun way, depending on how you design your slides.

372
00:58:01,448 --> 00:58:10,238
Monica Rosen: To just make them a little bit more engaging so that they can see you and your directly with the content that you're sharing with them.

373
00:58:10,238 --> 00:58:27,578
Joanna Kovacevich: One quick note that both of these features immersive view and the slide is virtual background is that they don't display the same way in the recording that they do in the live session it'll still be you'll still would see the slides and who's speaking, but it won't be in this Nice.

374
00:58:27,578 --> 00:58:31,118
Joanna Kovacevich: layout not yet anyway.

375
00:58:31,118 --> 00:58:34,688
Monica Rosen: Do you want to share your her.

376
00:58:34,688 --> 00:58:36,548
Monica Rosen: slides.

377
00:58:36,548 --> 00:58:49,628
Monica Rosen: So this only works with the PowerPoint one as much as we like Google slides at the moment they're not working, that way but PowerPoint does it and it does save locally.

378
00:58:49,628 --> 00:58:55,568
Monica Rosen: And we also have the polling you probably seen polling and some point may have even used it.

379
00:58:55,568 --> 00:59:07,628
Monica Rosen: So if you don't need really elaborate information like maybe from poll everywhere poll everywhere, has a lot of variety of different types of questions and again pushes back the grades over to canvas if you want to use that feature.

380
00:59:07,628 --> 00:59:14,348
Monica Rosen: You can actually use the pole system directly in zoom you can use these as a formative assessment, it could be like a quick little quiz.

381
00:59:14,348 --> 00:59:20,738
Monica Rosen: check check in kind of question, you can obtain student feedback or just kind of get a feel for the room.

382
00:59:20,738 --> 00:59:26,648
Monica Rosen: hey should we postpone this quiz because he's not quite on the right track, you can get some feedback on that.

383
00:59:26,648 --> 00:59:32,648
Monica Rosen: It can also generate some data for you, you can also download the csv files if you're really into.

384
00:59:32,648 --> 00:59:41,468
Monica Rosen: Learning analytics and kind of looking at how students are are reacting, you can use that and get some graphs and statistics from that that data as well.

385
00:59:41,468 --> 00:59:52,148
Monica Rosen: And, as mentioned, if you want to, if you want it to have it all not too many programs and external programs, then this option might be the best for you.

386
00:59:52,148 --> 01:00:01,598
Monica Rosen: The only thing to keep into consideration, you only have the multiple choice only types of questions single or multiple answer and the reactions that just sums up or yes, no voting.

387
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:07,058
Monica Rosen: If you want more sophisticated type of polling questions and you probably want to go in the direction of poll everywhere.

388
01:00:07,058 --> 01:00:22,118
Monica Rosen: There are there is cahoot and mental meter as well, a little bit less known and we actually don't have subscriptions to those you'll get the best bang, for your buck for poll everywhere, because you don't actually have to pay anything it's within our school.

389
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:28,178
Monica Rosen: um so the next thing is to talk about sharing audio video clips.

390
01:00:28,178 --> 01:00:37,628
Monica Rosen: So one way, you can do this is, you can obviously share your screen and have the video playing but there may be there may be reasons why you want to actually share.

391
01:00:37,628 --> 01:00:45,608
Monica Rosen: A clip individually for students, so that they can have it, and they can watch it on their own and then come back so you do have the option to.

392
01:00:45,608 --> 01:00:57,488
Monica Rosen: select the share option of an actual full video or video clip or even audio so that is there for you, if you're ever interested in doing so doing that.

393
01:00:57,488 --> 01:01:10,538
Monica Rosen: up next is the whiteboard as mentioned, this is similar to jam board with a few less options, so if we were to enable it see.

394
01:01:10,538 --> 01:01:11,828
Joanna Kovacevich: I mean I.

395
01:01:11,828 --> 01:01:13,628
Monica Rosen: think that that's something you have.

396
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:16,958
Joanna Kovacevich: To do it on your end yeah let me do a new share.

397
01:01:16,958 --> 01:01:21,008
Monica Rosen: So internally, you can still do the texture on with color.

398
01:01:21,008 --> 01:01:34,388
Monica Rosen: stamp spotlight laser pointer and even save all of this information externally as well.

399
01:01:34,388 --> 01:01:38,888
Monica Rosen: For some reason my toolbar is not showing up.

400
01:01:38,888 --> 01:01:52,778
Monica Rosen: Maybe that's something you have to enable for participants so maybe I think that that might be that the instructor has one and then shares this with the students, here we go it's going now.

401
01:01:52,778 --> 01:01:59,978
Monica Rosen: So you have that option as well just to us directly the annotation whiteboard on zoom.

402
01:01:59,978 --> 01:02:05,498
Monica Rosen: But again, this is only going to be in person, and if you ever wanted to do anything at.

403
01:02:05,498 --> 01:02:16,448
Monica Rosen: synchronously jam board might be the better option there there's also another one that's kind of similar and it's called idea boards it's also a free one.

404
01:02:16,448 --> 01:02:37,238
Monica Rosen: And for idea boards it's you can actually do more like design thinking and uploading so people can put in their ideas and then you can kind of like generate how those ideas are ranked so that's just another option is idea boards.

405
01:02:37,238 --> 01:02:54,218
Monica Rosen: i'm a few other additional features kind of talked about this in the polling section, you can always generate nonverbal feedback with a thumbs up or down, you can actually ask students to come back as to whether you need to slow down or speed up.

406
01:02:54,218 --> 01:03:03,428
Monica Rosen: You can always use the chat feature we're using the chat feature to share links and have students asked questions with each other on the side and then also being.

407
01:03:03,428 --> 01:03:07,238
Monica Rosen: Aware that you had the lice live closed captioning option.

408
01:03:07,238 --> 01:03:16,988
Monica Rosen: This is a good thing to continue to try to remember to turn on, especially because you don't always know the background of what your students are going through, they may be hard of hearing.

409
01:03:16,988 --> 01:03:24,308
Monica Rosen: They may you know, have allowed you know travel in the background, or maybe there's some reason why they need to turn their audio off.

410
01:03:24,308 --> 01:03:33,458
Monica Rosen: For that particular situation these transcripts are saved and off, you know you can have them and upload them later as well part of as part of your.

411
01:03:33,458 --> 01:03:40,208
Monica Rosen: recorded video so that's it's nice to know this information, mainly because there was a.

412
01:03:40,208 --> 01:03:49,808
Monica Rosen: poll that was done a survey earlier this year by the rackham school of graduate students and what we noticed some of the responses that.

413
01:03:49,808 --> 01:04:03,818
Monica Rosen: came in was that, yes, 300 349 of the almost 1000 participants had have claimed that they actually have a disability, which is probably a little bit surprisingly high.

414
01:04:03,818 --> 01:04:12,878
Monica Rosen: And then, even though 147 mentioned that they have no disability it, they still say that they would require some type of accommodation.

415
01:04:12,878 --> 01:04:16,538
Monica Rosen: And so just keeping in mind with these figures.

416
01:04:16,538 --> 01:04:23,978
Monica Rosen: Are It may be a good idea to try and get into the habit of turning on your closed captioning for students and reminding them.

417
01:04:23,978 --> 01:04:34,358
Monica Rosen: that once you turn on the closed captioning feature that they also need to make sure that they click the button for the live transcripts for them, for them to pop up.

418
01:04:34,358 --> 01:04:44,648
Monica Rosen: And lastly, is the the breakout room session I think we're using a lot of those I think that the Faculty been really great at using the breakout rooms for.

419
01:04:44,648 --> 01:04:51,488
Monica Rosen: small group think pair share peer reviews types of activities, you can actually do a quite a.

420
01:04:51,488 --> 01:05:05,648
Monica Rosen: bit of other things with the room so, for instance, as we did we assigned to each person to a group and we said hey these group numbers facility are associated with specific slide decks to work on, but you can also assign these rooms.

421
01:05:05,648 --> 01:05:21,908
Monica Rosen: For certain types of rooms so maybe you have a student an open work room and that's group one and maybe group two is a quiet work room maybe one is I need help, or an independent work room.

422
01:05:21,908 --> 01:05:26,408
Monica Rosen: And you can actually have the students self select the room that they want to go into.

423
01:05:26,408 --> 01:05:33,068
Monica Rosen: Or the instructor can pre assign them like maybe you already have students assigned to specific groups that they're working on a bigger project.

424
01:05:33,068 --> 01:05:35,528
Monica Rosen: Or you can assign on the fly.

425
01:05:35,528 --> 01:05:39,518
Monica Rosen: As the zoom session opens up, you can drag and drop people into specific groups.

426
01:05:39,518 --> 01:05:49,838
Monica Rosen: Or, as I did, and probably many of you have done in the past zoom can auto create groups, so you can say, I just want five groups in it equally distribute to students between those five groups.

427
01:05:49,838 --> 01:06:01,388
Monica Rosen: there's now also the added benefit of they asked for healthy feature available on each breakout room so whenever you're in the breakout room, it can alert the host so this group needs help.

428
01:06:01,388 --> 01:06:10,118
Monica Rosen: So you don't have to just keep popping in and cycling through each of the groups, they can actually flag you to come into the group to talk a little bit.

429
01:06:10,118 --> 01:06:14,978
Monica Rosen: And also now what's really great is that, as this is a new feature.

430
01:06:14,978 --> 01:06:23,498
Monica Rosen: zoom now allows you to continue to screen share as the instructor and the host of the zoom session, even though you're in breakout room, so this is new.

431
01:06:23,498 --> 01:06:36,848
Monica Rosen: again before it used to be that as soon as they went into the breakout rooms you couldn't see what it was that the instructor was screen sharing, but now that has carried over to the breakout rooms.

432
01:06:36,848 --> 01:06:53,468
Monica Rosen: And there's also enhanced code host privileges, so if you have a ta that's working with you and is maybe co hosting monitoring the chat room or anything like that they have almost all of the same.

433
01:06:53,468 --> 01:07:01,298
Monica Rosen: features and privileges as the actual host does now, with the added thing that they might.

434
01:07:01,298 --> 01:07:04,388
Monica Rosen: They can't end the meeting they can leave it but they can't end it.

435
01:07:04,388 --> 01:07:15,578
Monica Rosen: This is a good thing to counter get in the habit of making somebody a Co host in your course because if you as the instructor excellent get bumped out of your own zoom session.

436
01:07:15,578 --> 01:07:26,588
Monica Rosen: zoom will actually automatically choose somebody if you haven't designate who the Co host is it'll just randomly pick somebody to be the host, and so I don't know if any of you have been in that situation where you like console.

437
01:07:26,588 --> 01:07:35,738
Monica Rosen: Somebody made me as the instructor the host again because I lost that so it's a good idea to kind of get somebody to be the Co host, just in case that might happen.

438
01:07:35,738 --> 01:07:40,898
Monica Rosen: The co host can now broadcast messages to all the other groups.

439
01:07:40,898 --> 01:07:46,958
Monica Rosen: And they can also force all the participants back into the main room.

440
01:07:46,958 --> 01:08:05,558
Monica Rosen: Some things to know about the breakout rooms, is that there is a limit to 50 only And what if you have pre assigned group pre assigned breakout rooms, there is a cap of 200 participants participants to do that.

441
01:08:05,558 --> 01:08:14,918
Monica Rosen: So that is the end of all the tools that we wanted to go over i'm going to go ahead and pass this off over to Joanna now.

442
01:08:14,918 --> 01:08:25,568
Joanna Kovacevich: So we would invite you to attend any of our other upcoming training opportunities, as I mentioned, next week, we have a classroom recording with Pinatubo.

443
01:08:25,568 --> 01:08:39,758
Joanna Kovacevich: We have some sessions about preparing for those remote students, so if you're teaching in person, but you have a segment of students, that will be participating remotely we're going to have a session where we're focusing specifically on that.

444
01:08:39,758 --> 01:09:01,508
Joanna Kovacevich: We have some training sessions for GS is that we would love for you to invite your GPS is we're giving them some canvas basics zoom basics more in depth about teaching with zoom tools and then also some resilient teaching training, similar to what was offered when.

445
01:09:01,508 --> 01:09:05,258
Joanna Kovacevich: Everyone the university went remote.

446
01:09:05,258 --> 01:09:23,138
Joanna Kovacevich: Coming up tomorrow is also a session canvas summit hosted by it is teaching and learning and they're going to be showcasing some new features available in canvas, some of which I have not even yet learned about i'm going to learn about them.

447
01:09:23,138 --> 01:09:45,608
Joanna Kovacevich: Oh i'm sorry yeah it's tomorrow, and so the time block is 12 to five but they'll basically be running through each of the tools in 20 minutes segments, and so from the SP eight events calendar, I have that on, there is the canvas summit and they'll send you to the event information.

448
01:09:45,608 --> 01:10:03,368
Joanna Kovacevich: And so i'm just opening up this other additional poll, to see if there's anything else you would share with us feel like sharing about with us about what would be most helpful to you going forward as you prepare for the fall semester.

449
01:10:03,368 --> 01:10:21,578
Monica Rosen: If you have any ideas, we are also getting ready to put our fall training schedule together, and if there are specific things that you think would be especially interesting to learn about what we'd love to hear from you that's right.

450
01:10:21,578 --> 01:10:27,338
Joanna Kovacevich: Otherwise, that ends this session, and so we can open.

451
01:10:27,338 --> 01:10:37,868
Joanna Kovacevich: open it up for any last minute questions or we will really shoot a few minutes early and i'm going to go ahead and stop the recording so that we can.

452
01:10:37,868 --> 01:10:43,038
Joanna Kovacevich: answer any questions you might have.
