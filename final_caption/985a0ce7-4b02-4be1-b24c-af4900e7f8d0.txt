1
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:22,890
You've got to have most of you've gotten to through your smartphones.

2
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:33,550
Okay. So let's even if you haven't finished, we'll start just a couple of things and I'll post this on our CBT case study assignment page,

3
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:39,070
some resources to look up medications that might be helpful.

4
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:51,009
One way you can access a database, and I think you should have access if you go through the libraries that use them under databases.

5
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:55,629
If you search this way and you type in lexicon, make it.

6
00:00:55,630 --> 00:01:07,240
I'll post this for you as a resource. You should be able to access this database if we go to it for an example.

7
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:13,120
Then you can search up, search any drug. It's going to give you a huge monograph.

8
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:16,740
So you'll have to kind of look through it.

9
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:22,090
So this is like what it's used in the hospital. So it's going to give you way more information that than you need.

10
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:32,469
But that's a that's a resource. And then this would be possibly a more user friendly one is to go through the NIH, the Medline Plus,

11
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:45,270
and you can search different drugs and supplements here to find a better central place to look up medications before we start the case study.

12
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,090
So these are post these for your cardiovascular disease case studies.

13
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:54,130
I will post your first case study today.

14
00:01:54,280 --> 00:02:00,669
I did really good overall like over two percentage points higher than years past.

15
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:08,229
So really, really good job on that if you are not happy with your grade on the case study what

16
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:12,700
I've done in the past and so since we have two cardiovascular disease case studies,

17
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:22,360
you can complete both of those. So by the end of the semester you will have you can submit for case studies and I will drop your lowest grade.

18
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:27,760
So it's extra work, but that would replace your lowest case study if you chose to do both.

19
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:34,360
Cardiovascular disease case studies, if you if you are is happy with your your grades there.

20
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:39,070
So that is an option. And I'll I'll write that in the the assignments tab there.

21
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:43,770
Any questions? Yes. So you have them both done by the 20th?

22
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:48,129
No. So I usually will give you an extra week if you want to do another one.

23
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:54,040
But we will have to get it done before like within a reasonable time because I

24
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:59,100
don't want to release feedback and grades and then there's potential content.

25
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:04,440
So if are about this idea, then the problem is that yeah.

26
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,780
Any other questions on that? Okay.

27
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:20,230
So let's just take we're just take a couple of minutes. We'll finish talking about this case study on Tuesday.

28
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:25,360
So what did you get for this patient's ten year risk of heart disease or stroke?

29
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:32,590
Yeah. Did everybody get 10.5? Okay.

30
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,320
So at least that calculator works. It didn't work in years past.

31
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:41,380
There's other calculators. Could be interesting to see if they all come up with the same, like, ten year rest.

32
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:49,880
And you can see the feedback given here. So on the basis of your age and calculated risk, this patient.

33
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:59,390
So like if a physician use this, they might think of this patient as a candidate for stat and maybe we have for that this this

34
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:04,490
would be a conversation like that before starting any medication therapy with the physician.

35
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:10,330
We'll talk about blood pressure in more detail on Tuesday.

36
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:18,470
Whether we think that is like considered well-controlled or a one at 139 over 88 based on this and saying,

37
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,850
okay, some cardiologists may not be comfortable with that.

38
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:28,850
All right. Does anybody want to share their diagnoses for this patient?

39
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:35,760
What do you think are the two main nutrition problems?

40
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:45,990
Yeah. I just did excessive fat intake as a result of eating out for dinner 2 to 3 times a week and eating out for lunch during the day,

41
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:53,430
as evidenced by high total cholesterol, high LDL cholesterol, in addition to weight gain of Â£12.

42
00:04:53,760 --> 00:05:00,930
Okay. So I love your evidence because to support saying you said excessive fat intake is the diagnosis.

43
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:06,540
We have evidence of a high total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol.

44
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:13,290
The weight gain. What was the other one you had? Total cholesterol, high LDL, high triglycerides.

45
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:25,079
Triglycerides. So all the markers of the the lipids that may relate to a fat or high fat diet, that's good.

46
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:31,290
Does anything have if we're thinking about like a fat diagnosis with regard to fat intake, is there anything else?

47
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:38,240
Somebody else is happy ahead. And it's the same thing by the current behavior.

48
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:45,629
So the patient is on medication management for that, despite that, still having some elevated levels?

49
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:58,580
Sure. Well, I think intake of trans fats needs things like excessive saturated fat versus inadequate unsaturated fats.

50
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:01,890
Sure, yeah, yeah. Evidence and all that.

51
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:08,730
But that. Alright, so maybe specifying the specific type of fatty acid that may be is it's too excessive.

52
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:14,079
Yeah. It's also including just digestive health. Yeah, that's good.

53
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:20,760
It's like as your evidence like and we have I kind of filled out what the dietary

54
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:26,010
evidence shows like if he has too much of this particular type of fat or certain foods.

55
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,570
So I think that all of those are really good.

56
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:37,020
Any other diagnoses? Different diagnoses? Yeah, that's excessive.

57
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:51,530
So do you identify this type of and categorize just stage one analysis to 2007?

58
00:06:53,820 --> 00:07:01,050
So we have evidence of excessive sodium intake, especially from the diet recall to support that?

59
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:11,950
Yeah, definitely. That could be a focus there. How could he potentially have nothing to show?

60
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:21,230
Because, like, he's really like he's getting so much fat that he's gonna take it and that's what it has to be.

61
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:34,510
Does that mean. I would I would probably I would say probably that based on the entire picture, I don't think this patient is undernourished.

62
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:42,850
Triglycerides are tricky because they can be influenced by blood sugar levels, which I'll get him since normal.

63
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:46,420
So why somebody would have high circulating triglycerides.

64
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:57,070
You can see that in electricity I think it was that this particular thing but it's you know but to think like why else make.

65
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:16,700
Yeah because he actually discussed her distress and what silver suggested that approach is so that is your digestion.

66
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:28,320
So she may not be the one that has to take, but do we have something measurable to really say that that's what's happened?

67
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,540
But it's not for sure.

68
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:41,749
But I think maybe there's a theoretical and scientific basis to consider that.

69
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:46,560
But I don't think we have evidence of that something. My head.

70
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:55,710
I wouldn't go that direction for this picture. I like how all these things are considered.

71
00:08:55,770 --> 00:09:00,090
Yes. Question about the new technology.

72
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:03,960
So there's a lot more activity.

73
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:18,880
Would that be relevant for this case? Since that time said that, she decided to bring me every piece that I.

74
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:25,020
So that's a great question because we've tried to like, say, nutrition diagnoses.

75
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:31,140
What are we going to affect? And it's been more of like an inpatient type of focus.

76
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:36,240
But yes, you can use physical inactivity as a diagnosis that is not outside our scope.

77
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:45,900
How we might use that here so we know physical inactivity can, let's say, be related to is low HDL, for instance.

78
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:50,010
So it's like, well, let's maybe that's like a big goal of the patient.

79
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:54,910
And it's like, I want to be more active. I sit all day, I'm stressed out, you know.

80
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:58,620
Then you say the HDL is low. So that could definitely be a diagnosis.

81
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:04,920
If that's something that's a major priority with you and your patient, this is definitely more of like an outpatient scenario.

82
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:12,810
So those discussions are hard. So I don't want you guys to think it's not necessarily nutrition diagnosis.

83
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:14,700
So we don't use it. We we do.

84
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:22,290
There's certain situations where we're not going to use physical inactivity for maybe our patients in the hospital currently.

85
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,059
But this would be a situation I think you could because have evidence based on what

86
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:32,160
he's telling you is activity level is we have a reason to do it given the stress,

87
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:38,130
the weight gain, the low HDL, all of that could be benefited by physical activity.

88
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:43,710
So to reach beyond the diet and think lifestyle is appropriate so you can use that.

89
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:55,950
What would it take related to the drinking of caffeinated or alcoholic beverages rather than water by his right diet?

90
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:02,220
Yeah. So that he's not maybe hydration is a factor given what he's consuming.

91
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:08,280
So that could be a big focus, too. Yes, definitely. Coffee and alcohol does not match water.

92
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:21,330
Sure. So. Yeah, so and then that we would definitely have some really specific interventions like can we cut back on this and promote this?

93
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:27,250
So I think I know it's been like really focused on like malnutrition.

94
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:31,649
We've kind of like done a lot of that in the early part of this class.

95
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:39,930
But now, like with cardiovascular disease, a lot of this type of work is going to be outpatient counseling with it with these chronic diseases.

96
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:46,440
So you can think of ways to that would be more of a joint effort in terms of

97
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,640
coming up with a plan and based on what your patient's priorities are as well.

98
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:58,620
So I'll just look at a couple here. I think there is evidence of excessive energy intake.

99
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:03,779
You could do that related to frequent dining out lack of exercise.

100
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:06,929
So maybe also I use physical inactivity.

101
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:18,299
A lot is like an etiology too. So we have evidence that is consuming 142% of estimated energy needs and has this weight gain.

102
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:21,600
So that's usually a sign that there is some excessive energy intake.

103
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:31,380
I also use the intake of types of fats inconsistent with needs to really focus specifically on the saturated fats as opposed to total fat.

104
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:38,280
I think either way works, but this might help guide your interventions a little bit more in terms of being specific.

105
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:47,159
Very much the same type of etiology and evidence that you all spoke of,

106
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:54,900
so greater than 15% of calories from the diet coming from saturated fat in the patient, having an elevated LDL.

107
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:59,580
So that's speaking specifically to like the saturated fat component.

108
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:10,680
Inadequate fiber is another thing just because that may be an intervention that we might look at to help lower cholesterol and LDL.

109
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:17,430
We know that the the goal or the evidence to support fiber intake is pretty good.

110
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:22,679
So inadequate fiber intake related to undesirable food choices.

111
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:28,260
So this patient is consuming less than 30% of recommended type of goal for an adult male.

112
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:33,690
So there's some room there to have some specific interventions as well.

113
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:41,190
But these are not all you know, there's plenty of problems for this patient that we could address this dietitians.

114
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:51,390
So let's we'll finish this off on Tuesday talking about this patient and I'll post what I have so you can you can see how I kind of approached it.

115
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:55,260
But there's plenty of ways that we could approach this patient.

116
00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:03,059
I would say if you're able to come to class on Tuesday, we're not going to do a formal lecture.

117
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:06,150
We're going to try and get a little bit more interactive.

118
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:12,270
I know we're kind of in the end of the semester, you're kind of getting there.

119
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:19,770
It's a little bit difficult, I know, for you guys with these long lectures, so we'll try and make it a little bit more lively.

120
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:25,290
So try and be here if you can. We'll finish up this case study and then we'll we'll discuss hypertension together.

121
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,240
All right. Thank you guys so much. I'll see you next week.
