1
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:25,110
Oh, should we start or should we end as planned for in February?

2
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,180
It's kind of it's just amazing.

3
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:37,080
So today the plan is to wrap up any questions on homework.

4
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:45,330
Okay. First, I want to talk a little bit about traffic and traffic related airplanes doing

5
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:52,710
a quick preview into health impact assessment and then homework after that.

6
00:00:52,830 --> 00:01:01,620
Okay. And I've answered a few questions on the homework via email.

7
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,030
Please continue to ask and if you don't understand, just let me know.

8
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,740
Okay. We can always do a Zoom session as well, if that's helpful for you.

9
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:18,360
I did not have a chance to wrap up all the grades and put them in one place.

10
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:24,600
What? I plan on doing that in the next couple of weeks this year.

11
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:29,250
So if you do want to, you can just give me a call.

12
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:36,480
Do that. Uh, the grading policy is on the syllabus.

13
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:42,360
There are a couple of the short quizzes which are Draft Lewis two.

14
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:46,560
Okay, so if you have a little quiz, great. Don't worry about it.

15
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:51,570
Okay. You have three little quiz credits. See me or talk to me if you care.

16
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:56,310
Okay. I mean, again, the purpose here is just to give you the information.

17
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:07,470
Okay, uh, this last quiz, number ten was hard, and, um, you know, these models, these air pollution models are very complicated.

18
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:12,120
How is the screen view model working? As everybody figured it out.

19
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:16,110
Got it to run. I haven't even access.

20
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:19,320
Good. I can't. Yeah. What's the problem?

21
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:26,850
I've tried to use campus computers. They all require admin log in to install the software.

22
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:33,480
I mean, I have a mac and I tried to go through, like the loaner laptop program for the university.

23
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:38,790
So, I mean, that's the pickle I'm in.

24
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:45,180
Mm hmm. Um, as a last resort, I'm happy to lend you a computer.

25
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:51,030
Okay. Ideally done here so I can get it back in a few hours, but.

26
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:58,170
Yeah, I'm. I'm working on a few things, so I might be able to, uh, to download software.

27
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:05,470
Okay. Is there any way we have, like, an extension on the assignment from this, like, our deadline?

28
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:12,090
We want it to. Uh, I mean, if a day or two helps, no problem.

29
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:17,680
But I, um. I'm actually away most of that week, and I need to get the grades in.

30
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:23,099
That's my concern. So because I need to print them out so I can look at them and I can't print them out.

31
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:28,810
All right, trouble? I guess I could. It's just less convenient for me, but, yeah, if you need another day or two, no bother.

32
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:34,530
Okay. Who's your in your team? Uh, Sarah.

33
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,760
Yeah. So neither of you have laptops.

34
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:42,719
I'm trying to get a hold of her as a girl.

35
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:49,410
I guess I'm. Yeah. Oh, and I guess, I mean, we can email back and forth.

36
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:53,750
Yeah, I take her kids. Yeah. Yeah.

37
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,790
Um, yeah. Just let me know and. Yeah, if you need more time.

38
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,970
That's okay. Okay. Others have been able to get it to run.

39
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:09,240
Yeah. Okay. Did anybody get it to run on a mac with emulation software?

40
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:14,100
No, no, no. Okay. Okay.

41
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:21,460
Well, anyway, sorry about that. But I mean, you have to use a model to to understand how these dispersion models work.

42
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:25,180
And so this question is good.

43
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:30,070
The screen view model simulates worst case.

44
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:38,709
It's a screening model. Okay. And the idea is that, of course, if you have a high concentration that exceeds the applicable limit,

45
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:44,800
whether it's a standard or a guideline, then you can use other models to explore in depth.

46
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:56,830
On the other hand, if screen view gives you a concentration which is below any relevant standard, then there's no need to take it further.

47
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:05,340
Okay, because under any realistic condition, non worst case concentrations will be even lower in this idea.

48
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:08,860
A function of screening is really important, so that makes sense.

49
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:15,040
Why? It's called screen view. Okay.

50
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,880
And it's worst case because it's plume center line,

51
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:27,220
a critical distance where the highest concentration occurs and the critical combination of wind speed and stability.

52
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:45,090
Okay, good. So some of these questions were about a lapse rates and dispersion of pollutants, and the only correct answer was the first one.

53
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:54,120
The stable conditions suppress vertical turbulence, so you won't have this up and downs that plumes will spread out horizontally in like a farm.

54
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:59,240
And then there were some questions about permitting.

55
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:05,210
And those looked pretty good. So we talked through one of them.

56
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,300
Sure. Which one? Um.

57
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,230
Above. Yeah. Okay.

58
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:20,980
All right. So this one I just mentioned, the annual average temperature in Michigan is about nine degrees C.

59
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:27,020
Okay. On average, temperatures in elevation of the surface are expected to be cooler by 9.8.

60
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:36,600
How did that happen? Well, they applied the lapse rate of 9.0.98 400 meters.

61
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,880
Okay. Which is the dry area by the collapse rate.

62
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:52,660
Okay. But in reality, we use a standard idiomatic lapse rate, which includes the effect of humidity because air is moist.

63
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:58,930
So from that statement, we were expecting to know that that was the dry.

64
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:11,120
Yeah, it's basically that the dry one was applied to get that value, not the correct one, which would be the standard inaccurate.

65
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,390
Okay. And so the same thing kind of applies to here.

66
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,750
Well, on this one and centimeters elevation.

67
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,580
So here's my basket.

68
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:39,820
Here's the ground level, ten meters, I'd have temperature of five at 110 meters, high temperature of 4.3.

69
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:53,740
So the delta T over the delta Z, 4.8 minus five is -4.2.

70
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:59,050
And divide that by 100 meters difference. Okay, so that's labs, right?

71
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:03,130
Mm hmm. Okay. But remember, lapse rate is defined as negative.

72
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:09,500
That surface goes to positive. So that's not very much of a lapse here.

73
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:15,720
Okay. And so that would be somebody about it.

74
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:24,060
So it's not where we look at that table that's in the notes there is.

75
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:28,830
Yeah. Yeah, you could look at that. But I don't think that gives you temperature differences.

76
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:34,050
So where would I look to compare that lapse rate and determine if it's considered stable or.

77
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:48,120
I am not sure in the notes where I put that, but I think there is some examples of ranges for temperature collapse rates versus stability.

78
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:52,020
But you should recognize that this is almost a constant temperature.

79
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:57,270
I mean, it's not zero. Okay. It's pulling up up very rapidly.

80
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,310
Okay. And then.

81
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:05,330
Stability system use temperature, wind speed, cloud cover insulation.

82
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:09,440
Just made the stability cloud. That's wrong because it doesn't use temperature.

83
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:16,340
Okay. Temperature doesn't matter. I can move the whole temperature up or down and it really doesn't matter.

84
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:26,870
It's just the change in the temperature with elevation and the particle before Turner System Base is actually just based on wind speed,

85
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:30,500
cloud cover and sunlight intensity. Thank you.

86
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:34,899
Okay, good. Very detailed.

87
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:39,000
You get this. I'm really happy because there's a lot of information in this.

88
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:42,430
People don't understand these models that.

89
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:46,660
Well, many of the casual users. Okay.

90
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:58,900
I want very, very briefly to look at some stuff with traffic traffic related air pollutants.

91
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:09,819
And this is such a transformation right now that's happening because we are really starting to pay a lot more attention to livable, walkable cities.

92
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:13,390
Speaking of cycling, maybe as congested as this freeway?

93
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,870
Probably not, you know, making it quite look like that.

94
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:23,740
But the idea is to get into something that is much more healthy.

95
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:32,620
And I'm asked quite a lot about electrification, what is that going to do to air pollutants and so forth?

96
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:44,290
And this is a really good question because in the urban area where most people live, the number one pollution source, it's traffic is mobile sources.

97
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:57,219
And so I would say that exposure to air pollutants is still increasing from traffic related sources because of urbanization,

98
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:01,390
more vehicles, more commuting, more freight, more congestion.

99
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:11,219
And we know vulnerable populations often live in low. Uh, uh, income areas.

100
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:15,660
And this is often by commuting lines as well, but not always.

101
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,450
We have a lot of new development by freeways as well.

102
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:32,210
And then we have things like traffic oriented development or transit oriented development where we actually place housing by highways or uh,

103
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:36,660
uh, interchanges or subway stops and things like that.

104
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:42,000
And this can also increase exposure. And then we have more and more trucks on the route.

105
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:49,890
Now, when all of this becomes electrified, okay, these statements may change, but we're not quite there yet.

106
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:59,650
And vehicle emissions are different from smokestack or point sources because they're not released.

107
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:02,970
Elevated levels are right at ground level. Okay.

108
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:14,340
And so this is a big difference. And we know also that the small particles that are produced both by diesel and by spark,

109
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:22,379
ignition or gasoline engines can be dangerous for your health because they penetrate deeply into

110
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:27,990
the lung and they include a number of different components and their surface active and so forth.

111
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,930
So there's a lot of toxicology that we know about vehicle related emissions as well.

112
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:38,540
And then finally, there's this notion of co exposure. Okay.

113
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:44,340
We also have noise vibration associated with as well.

114
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,809
So one simplistic approach,

115
00:12:49,810 --> 00:13:01,300
but this gets some traction is to consider part of a profile of a major highway or a freeway where the zone of greatest exposure might occur within,

116
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:06,580
let's say, about 500 meters, maybe a thousand meters. But it gets worse the closer you are.

117
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:12,400
Okay. This is not an elevated source, so I don't have a plume rising overhead.

118
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:23,830
So folks at ground level are most exposed. And this has been documented with measurements.

119
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:29,590
And we have a number of models that are used for this particular kind of source.

120
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:39,370
This is the concentration profile. The wind is blowing to the right of over road, which is a longer zero distance here.

121
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:45,969
And you can see the greatest impact with this model is very interesting.

122
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:51,250
And it was one of the first models to actually show that there can be upwind exposure as well.

123
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:58,900
And so this model incorporates a tail that moves in the upward direction due to eddies that might occur once in a while.

124
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:05,980
This available on a web application.

125
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,060
They changed the name from our line to C line if you are ever interested in using that.

126
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:20,490
The other thing to think about for traffic exposure is that it's just one source.

127
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:28,169
And I like this picture because it shows sort of a hypothetical rush hour in the morning where we're generating,

128
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:34,200
for example, particles from traffic for the quiet in the afternoon, evening rush hour.

129
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:37,650
The shape of this is completely wrong, in my opinion. It's just an artist's conception.

130
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:45,840
We have other sources of PM in the urban environment which are shown by this blue line.

131
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:55,230
So this might be industry, it might be in training, soils, whatever, and then a lot of PM drifts in from long range.

132
00:14:56,070 --> 00:15:07,530
A lot of that is ammonium sulfate. It's oxidized sulfur dioxide produced by power plants and Ohio River Valley and Monroe, Michigan, whatever.

133
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:12,300
And that's what we call the regional background, which doesn't vary that much over time.

134
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:19,170
And so in a sense, this uses if we go back to that principle of superposition,

135
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:26,070
basically the net or the sum of the exposure is the sum of these three components.

136
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:33,600
And so we have the very top of this representing what you're actually exposed to.

137
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:38,549
Okay. So this picture is also not that well understood by many people.

138
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:50,700
They think, oh, it's all from traffic. It's not there are at least these three types of generalized sources that add to the urban exposures.

139
00:15:54,640 --> 00:16:03,230
Which is most important. The 24 hour period so far.

140
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:21,230
Yeah, well, uh, our latest analysis in cities like Detroit show that the these urban pieces are typically pretty small,

141
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,270
and the 24 hour traffic profile is kind of similar to the background level.

142
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:34,580
Okay. And that applies to the Midwestern area where we have a lot of coal fired power plants producing this regional power.

143
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:43,100
But. The answer is, it kind of depends on the pollutant for carbon monoxide or sulfur dioxide.

144
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:52,030
The regional and the urban background would be pretty small. All right.

145
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:58,520
So anyway, not a class about health, but PM is one of the most important ones nonetheless.

146
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:05,930
And lots of epi studies and we've done a lot of that and I don't want to get into this too much here.

147
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:13,610
We talked about emission inventories a little bit and I don't think I need to go into this again.

148
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:25,370
And, um, but you guys should be aware that there are traffic estimates from a variety of different networks.

149
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:30,290
And typically what they do is for state and federal roads,

150
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:40,280
there are shape files that you can get into the state files if you are able to find a source has ADT associated with it,

151
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:47,630
which is annual average daily traffic and commercial traffic of CAA data.

152
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:55,340
And these estimates are assembled by every state, at least every ten years because this is the way they get federal highway money.

153
00:17:55,910 --> 00:18:01,640
And this information is very useful for air pollution work because we need to know what the traffic volumes are.

154
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:06,710
Okay. And so this is Detroit.

155
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:15,410
We're just out of the picture here for I-94, as seems more only about 40,000 vehicles per day.

156
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,900
96,000 128,000 vehicles per day.

157
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:27,910
And this will be primarily heavy duty trucks, down about 1/10 of 1/20 of that number typically.

158
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:39,829
So this information exists. And, you know, these days to figure out exposures of people which you call them, which you code the traffic patterns.

159
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:45,020
And we use models as shown here to estimate what their exposures are.

160
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:53,250
And so this is becoming. Not standard, but one of the techniques that can be used.

161
00:18:55,420 --> 00:19:02,570
A couple more points. I'm going to quit on this. Traffic is obviously very periodic or cyclical.

162
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:07,960
During a weekday, we'll often see a morning and evening rush hour both.

163
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:12,020
And that applies for vehicles overall.

164
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:16,190
But if you separate out the commercial vehicles, these are heavy duty trucks.

165
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:17,900
They have a very different pattern.

166
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:24,770
They basically start work at six or seven or eight in the morning, work through the afternoon, and basically aren't there in the evening.

167
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:34,010
This is important because one of those big trucks can put out 20 to 50 times as much NOx and PM as a passenger car.

168
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:44,570
So it's important to characterize them. And then patterns on the weekend and weekdays are different as well as shown in some of these other slides.

169
00:19:54,620 --> 00:20:00,470
I did mention when we talked about monitoring about a near road monitor that the EPA set this up.

170
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:09,890
If you guys drive to the airport, Detroit airport, you'll see on the north side of the highway, this right around.

171
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:15,690
And 2039 or 24.

172
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:21,450
I can't remember right now. Anyway, it's a monitor just adjacent to the highway,

173
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:29,880
and it's designed specifically to measure impacts from vehicles as part of the near road monitoring network.

174
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:35,790
States don't like to operate these things because the people crash into it.

175
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:49,340
So if that happened there. The rest of this is research oriented.

176
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:54,130
So this is our experimental vehicle.

177
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:58,520
We have a lot of instrumentation on it. And we we drive around and measure stuff.

178
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:02,990
And if you're interested in this kind of work, please see me.

179
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:06,770
But it's not so integral to the class.

180
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,050
Okay, but we always need help.

181
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:16,690
So if you're interested, I mean. Okay.

182
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:26,200
The main thing today is to talk about how to expand ISAs into areas which are more health relevant.

183
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:31,420
And to do this, I want to really recap some of the class.

184
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:39,969
So this is quite a luxury for me to be able to do this. I almost always run out of time and for some reason we have an extra session this year.

185
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:44,570
I don't know why. And allow me to talk a little bit about some of these other topics.

186
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:53,030
So. How many of you recognize some of the titles up here?

187
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,360
Yeah. You should recognize some of them. My think.

188
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:05,450
I mean, there's so many different tools that are out there now in terms of environmental assessments,

189
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:09,980
sustainability indicators, management programs and so forth.

190
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:14,630
Okay. There's lots of things. Some of them are better than others.

191
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:23,720
Some of them have standards for their application. Some of them require teams extensive data.

192
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:27,710
Some are more conceptual. Lots of different types of things out there.

193
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:46,940
The whole idea here is to account for life cycle impacts for across the, you know, a product from sort of extraction to end of life and disposal.

194
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:57,610
Others are designed to ensure accountability in policymaking so that we understand sort of the implications very similar to ISAs.

195
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:04,820
Some of them are used by some fields more than others, like lifecycle assessment types of things.

196
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,890
So, you know, where does the US fit into this and NEPA?

197
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:20,240
Well, if you go back and remember what NEPA was supposed to do, it's supposed to consider environmental impacts,

198
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:26,600
which were pretty broadly defined, measured objectively, hopefully using indicators.

199
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:35,600
And then NEPA was to create and maintain conditions under which man and nature can exist in harmony.

200
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:43,460
Okay. And the procedure for doing this was to receive attention for these environmental values and decision making,

201
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:52,910
using the federal agencies as the mechanism and requiring this to be developed and considered.

202
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:59,750
Okay. So you're at the end of this course. You looked at a couple of voices in detail.

203
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:10,190
Does this work? What do you think?

204
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:17,860
Not really. Not really. And so to say is nothing.

205
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:26,660
So expound on that a little bit. Um, you can even say what all you want in an EIA.

206
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:32,700
And like. And it's all based on models which, like, have assumptions.

207
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:39,530
And so there's I just feel like there are people, unfortunately,

208
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:48,439
in this world that would write an EIA based on what they think people want to hear instead of what they're actually going to do.

209
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:53,240
And then maybe once they get permission, they can just do whatever they want. Okay.

210
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:59,480
Probably a realistic view. Good. So others.

211
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:05,340
I kind of agree. In a way. Sorry, this is more like.

212
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:08,700
But it's going to make me so depressed. I'm going to need to sit down.

213
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:20,940
I think Nieva tries but needs to be better because it's so broad that like it doesn't really like it makes an effect,

214
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:25,200
but it's maybe not the effect that we need going forward.

215
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:30,780
But but you have to explain because I mean, it has to be broad because of social impacts.

216
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:34,410
We're looking at cultural. Environmental. Right.

217
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:43,979
Have I feel like almost each of those need their own kind of categories and then specific applications within those to be able

218
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:52,740
to I don't want to say that need to be more controlling but it but like people can get away with a lot I think because of NEPA,

219
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:55,860
because of its broadness. Um, yeah.

220
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:06,300
So I think is I think the intention that we ever had was like, good.

221
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,680
But maybe it's not the most efficient process.

222
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:18,640
And I think there's a lot of like maybe not necessarily loopholes, but like the whole like public engagement thing.

223
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:24,969
It needs a different take on it. I mean, when was NEPA created?

224
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:31,090
It was like the seventies or something, very 70. So, yeah, like, you know, in a modern society,

225
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:42,070
I think public engagement is accessible and maybe just like getting the idea out there that like you're a stakeholder,

226
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:50,530
you know, as just a resident or like whether it's like making a NEPA for some Forest Service land.

227
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:55,750
Like, that's my forest, man. Like, you should be worrying about it, so let's get the public involved.

228
00:26:56,230 --> 00:27:07,420
I think that's where a lot of the downfall is personally, because then like alternatives that they propose are really looked at seriously.

229
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:16,330
Maybe. So, like I said, I think the intention with NEPA is there, but in today's society it needs to be reevaluated,

230
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:21,580
probably like stripped down to the bare bones and have, like, a different take on it, so.

231
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:28,150
Mm hmm. One more thing. Yeah. And he goes on to the problem with enforcement.

232
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:32,740
I mean, there's no teeth that also, you know, if you have the the best intentions,

233
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:38,470
the most well thought out plan, you can still just fall back on what you want to do originally.

234
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:42,430
No harm, no foul, except anything that you're harming family.

235
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:46,120
But no one's going to come back to you for years. You just have to consider it.

236
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:49,170
Yeah. I mean, I think you have a good diversity of views right here.

237
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:55,720
Okay? I mean, you know, you want teeth, enforcement, prescription, you want more flexibility for the here and now.

238
00:27:56,470 --> 00:28:00,640
And, you know, the only thing you ever did was put information back.

239
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:05,649
It had no teeth because except that you had to put out the information, but it had no teeth.

240
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:10,479
It didn't guarantee your process would be improved. That information would be used in a constructive way.

241
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,590
It could just be disregarded completely. It's just information.

242
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:21,700
It seems hopelessly naive in some way. So, you know, but it had a huge impact nonetheless.

243
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:29,650
And, you know, without that information, I mean, imagine being muzzled, you know, you just don't know.

244
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,140
There's a trend at the time, like in the seventies, to do an immigration law.

245
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:42,120
It just feels like it was what it would be like if it had passed today.

246
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,780
Yeah, that's a good question. I don't know. What do you think it would be like now?

247
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:51,660
Hopefully it'll be some mechanism of enforcement that you can just say whatever words you want.

248
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:59,130
I mean, but still stays in the as the environmental justice piece on the the Keystone XL pipeline.

249
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:03,940
That contrasted that to how much news was getting out about you know,

250
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:10,030
that that leaks and then we learned about the steps yet the pipeline leaks and now we can hear later fresh water

251
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:19,300
where they had just a simple paragraph where everybody is everybody along the pipeline is equally impacted.

252
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:25,450
Right. And of course, right to choose that run through the pipeline. So I mean, yeah, hopefully there'll be a mechanism.

253
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:36,190
I mean it's a really interesting exercise to think what kind of legislation we would pass these days if we could get to the other issue.

254
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,160
Yeah, I don't know.

255
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:50,680
I mean, the thing that people are talking about is fixing these because we recognize, you know, it's bureaucratic, it has a lot of gaps in it.

256
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:56,050
And, you know, one of the major gaffs is cumulative impacts it goes into.

257
00:29:57,590 --> 00:30:02,930
Okay. Something to talk about a little bit more. But don't underestimate how important a trip.

258
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:09,710
Okay. It's really changing. Okay. And without that information, you just wouldn't know any of the stuff.

259
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:14,360
So that that is important. Why didn't the press me that badly?

260
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:22,660
So. Mm hmm. Yeah, I think. I don't know the specifics of it, but it feels like there was so much climate legislation passed through then.

261
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:31,430
I remember years ago that, like, mothering, infrastructure, do all those projects have to go through NEPA?

262
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:37,460
Huh? That's a really good question. Some of them do, but many of them don't.

263
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:47,270
So and don't ask me which ones do or don't. Okay. I know that some of them do that because that and that wasn't that wasn't environmental legislation.

264
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:51,290
That was in terms of the Inflation Reduction Act that just threw money at a bunch of different things.

265
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:58,610
Oh, okay. There has been no real headway on legislation dealing with environmental protection at all except in the courts,

266
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:01,160
and that's been generally not pro-environment.

267
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:08,899
I feel like it'd just be horribly ironic if it's like, you know, you pass some type of legislation to help the climate,

268
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:12,620
but then it gets delayed through NEPA, which is trying to protect environment.

269
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:16,940
Well, I think that's likely to happen. Okay.

270
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:28,909
I mean, you know, people will throw up roadblocks. So, again, you know, NEPA 1970, 1969, really, we have Christmastime, 1969, first in the US.

271
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:34,700
And again, you know, it had these goals of predicting positive and negative outcomes, evaluating options,

272
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:42,560
using sort of systems approach to evaluate and mitigate options, adverse impacts and get the public engagement there.

273
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:52,129
The process itself, you know, somewhat bureaucratic, a written statement, a draft or a consultation, the final presented to decision makers.

274
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:56,150
And they had to actually make a decision on that. Okay. But they could disregard it.

275
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:04,489
And, you know, we've talked about a little bit pollutant transport and food and how things are pretty complicated.

276
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:08,450
There is both direct and indirect exposure pathways and I can get into that now.

277
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:13,370
And you looked at the Keystone project and you know,

278
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:21,140
the goal here that Jay articulated in one of the papers I gave you was the NEPA should be anticipatory,

279
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:27,470
should try to anticipate what's going to happen. NEPA fails at this because humans fail at this.

280
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:32,360
Right. Because we have primary impacts. Yeah, but what about those secondary effects?

281
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:39,920
Really, really challenging. I mean, I build a road. I don't expect there to be I don't know what's going to happen after I build the road.

282
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:46,760
Right. So lots of secondary and then, you know, mandated public participation.

283
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,840
And then the goal was to end institutionally embedded.

284
00:32:52,850 --> 00:33:00,340
Okay. So. This is a one page critique of the NEPA process.

285
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:06,219
First thing is, it's reactive. Okay, I'm going to build a project now.

286
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:15,160
I need an EIA. Okay. We would like to have is something that is proactive and informs development.

287
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:21,970
So instead of building this kind of, you know, facility, what do we really want at this piece of land?

288
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:25,950
Okay. So, yeah. Yeah.

289
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:35,320
I kind of feel that being proactive, the EIA assesses effects of the environment of the proposed development on the environment.

290
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:40,360
But a lot of people will argue what we need is to assess the effects of the

291
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:45,100
environment on what those development needs and opportunities are in this region.

292
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:51,700
So it shouldn't be project oriented, but it should be sort of spatial oriented.

293
00:33:53,320 --> 00:34:03,100
NEPA is designed to deal with a specific project, but what we really want is to look at an area or a region or a sector.

294
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:09,610
You know, as an example here, if you look at a facility in southwest Detroit.

295
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:14,380
Okay. And if you guys went on the tour, you're familiar with that.

296
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:18,370
We really need to consider the overall area, not just a single project.

297
00:34:19,930 --> 00:34:24,380
NEPA, You know, I have a project I put together my year.

298
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:30,940
I give it to you. It goes out for public comment or revise it, but stamp it or assign a date it.

299
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:34,510
I'm done. Okay. So it's the beginning and an end.

300
00:34:36,970 --> 00:34:41,200
But development doesn't work that way. Okay. We have one development.

301
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:45,220
It triggers the second one. We need a continuing process.

302
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:53,889
Okay. So NEPA kind of feels that way. We've talked about direct impacts and secondary impacts.

303
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:59,320
NEPA really focuses on the direct impacts. Health impacts are somewhat the emphasized.

304
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:10,240
Possibly what we want to look at primarily is cumulative impacts, multiple factors, multiple exposures, secondary development, so forth.

305
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,000
NEPA doesn't really do a very good job at that.

306
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:31,820
Of course, we talked about the EIA process whereby if you have a way to mitigate impacts, you don't need to go on to the full year.

307
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:38,430
You can just stick with an environmental assessment of EIA. So there's a lot of emphasis on mitigation of impacts.

308
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:46,830
Advocates will say what we need to do is maintain and enhance environmental quality in that area, not just mitigate the impacts of a project.

309
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:57,410
And finally here, you know, you guys may have a fairly narrow perspective, a lot of detail on a certain number of things.

310
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:03,770
But perhaps what we need is a wider perspective and maybe varying levels of detail that are suitable.

311
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:08,090
What we really want to do is provide an overall vision and framework for development.

312
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:15,590
So most of these are kind of development oriented, not project oriented, considering communities.

313
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:25,250
Again, not just specific projects, considering them in a overall continuing way with with a focus on addressing cumulative impacts.

314
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:35,840
Okay. So earlier in the course, I talked about these different kinds of critical health and environmental challenges.

315
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:49,640
And I don't think I gave you this, but there is this public health paradigm where we track disease, we investigate outbreaks, we communicate.

316
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:54,980
We partner with different folks. We have plans to prepare.

317
00:36:55,370 --> 00:37:01,820
We try to protect the most vulnerable. We have to have a workforce which is prepared to respond.

318
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:08,660
We look at the links. This one is on climate change, but it could be on infectious disease or whatever.

319
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:12,710
And this cycle continues. Okay.

320
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:24,080
This is the dream, right? It's a sort of systems approach to dealing with ongoing and, you know, newly developing threats to public health.

321
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:31,010
This health health paradigm has been around for a while.

322
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:35,630
Most of us don't understand it that well, and we feel incredibly resource constrained.

323
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:51,380
Just not enough people to do this kind of work. You may have seen the essential public health services in other contexts.

324
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:56,210
And, you know, again, these are this is the dream.

325
00:37:56,600 --> 00:38:03,290
Okay. We'd like this to happen. But again, we feel incredibly under-resourced to do all these things.

326
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:21,070
So I like to use instead as a public health paradigm, a much simplified action cycle where we recognize human activities in these areas cause impacts.

327
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:24,790
We need to develop policies to mitigate these impacts.

328
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:32,920
This is somewhat responding, not proactive, but nonetheless, I mean, it's just kind of simplified over that big paradigm.

329
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:40,790
When I look at the approaches that have been used over the years, I have to look at some trends.

330
00:38:41,810 --> 00:38:44,840
And some of the trends is that the time scales have increased.

331
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:50,300
NEPA and others focus on longer term issues frequently.

332
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:54,530
What we probably need to look at is kind of life cycle.

333
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:58,730
Okay, so that spans to lifetime or even intergenerational.

334
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:14,190
This course, we looked at spatial scales from zero surface issues, micro dispersion, diffusion, types of things to almost global.

335
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:17,640
We have a lot of different spatial scales.

336
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:25,620
We need to be able to use these in a fluid way, go from micro environments to communities and global impacts.

337
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:31,710
You guys have had a lot of interesting thoughts about participation and stakeholders.

338
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:43,630
Well, we haven't talked very much about is sort of process oriented assessments rather than product oriented.

339
00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:49,990
And I'll talk more about that as well. And things have become personal.

340
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:54,640
In many ways, it's not just institutional spelling mistake right there.

341
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:05,200
We also have trends that are dealing with the multi-disciplinary nature of all of these things.

342
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:11,380
I think that when NEPA was written in 1970, the idea was, okay, you have an air pollution problem.

343
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:16,179
Let's keep it that way. We don't have to worry about the water pollution associated with that.

344
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:21,560
It's very simple, very single disciplinary. Now we recognize it's very multi-disciplinary.

345
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:28,990
I think another trend is to encompass many more methods of analysis.

346
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:33,250
So I've tried to talk a little bit about some of the modeling techniques,

347
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:42,790
but there is a whole host of other techniques that are used and they all should be evidence based and they can help in assessing and resolving issues.

348
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:47,560
And then finally, drivers the drivers have changed completely.

349
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:52,360
Okay. And, you know, before it was just let's build a power plant.

350
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:59,800
But now we have to think about the energy system. And that energy system is under revolutions, you know, very much changing.

351
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:10,750
Okay. So practically, what's the role of public health and what's the role of environmental impact

352
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:15,340
assessments and so forth in some of these big issues of sustainable development,

353
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:18,420
environmental management? Okay.

354
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:21,550
So I make a couple arguments here and now. You don't have to agree with me.

355
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:26,110
Okay. But I would say that environmental health is a key indicator.

356
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:50,430
Right. For sustainability. I help set up a program which we call energy for sustainability some years ago, and we argued about the term many,

357
00:41:50,430 --> 00:42:00,420
many hours because this was a bunch of engineers looking to figure out how to provide, you know, sustainable systems in the energy area.

358
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:08,250
And it was not energies for energy sake, but it was energy to promote sustainability.

359
00:42:08,850 --> 00:42:13,920
So we ended up with IFRS for energy, for stability, for sustainability.

360
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:22,380
Anyway, that's just recognizing that the driver here is not energy, but it's sustainability.

361
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:32,080
Okay. So my second point is that this is a key driver, but not the only one.

362
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:38,560
A third is that we need to get evidence based tools.

363
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:48,099
Okay. And then we want to have participatory in systems, types of models that can be used for these three purposes,

364
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:52,750
surveillance, know what's going on, evaluation and intervention.

365
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:56,560
That's a public health threat. Of course. Yeah. Yeah, sure.

366
00:42:56,660 --> 00:43:09,850
The question so is, is like environmental health as a key in order for sustainability, is that like measuring people and as well as the environment?

367
00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:14,500
Or is that just like kind of cooking like soil and water and. No, that's a great question.

368
00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:25,150
With in this argument, I am saying health and it's human health and it could be ecological health and it probably should be, which is the indicator.

369
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:30,400
Okay, cool. Okay. The what are the evidence based tools like?

370
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:33,770
Could you give an example of just one of those? Sure.

371
00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:42,220
So we might use something like the risk assessment or what I'm going to say is a health impact assessment tool,

372
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:47,830
followed up with health surveillance and so forth to show that things are appropriate.

373
00:43:48,730 --> 00:44:01,600
So, you know, in some ways, the argument that we're using evidence based tools now is not solid,

374
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:06,520
because if you look at the health of the population, it's not really changing much.

375
00:44:07,090 --> 00:44:19,000
And the gap between, say, certain areas or certain race, ethnicities or incomes is increasing compared to better off individuals.

376
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:33,230
Okay. So that's a challenge. And you know, all these things particularly apply to susceptible populations and the poor, often the most vulnerable.

377
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:37,340
And, you know, there's lots of reasons, and I provide some of them up here.

378
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:41,930
We have folks who are homeless. We have housing, which is deficient.

379
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:47,390
We have transport and schools which are often deficient as well.

380
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:58,129
You know, this notion of climate migration or refugees is going to be growing in importance.

381
00:44:58,130 --> 00:45:00,470
I think we have a lot of folks who are going to be displaced.

382
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:11,210
We have, you know, fair limits to access for health and rehabilitation, food and water insecurity.

383
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:14,720
Basically, all of these things are exacerbating inequities.

384
00:45:14,810 --> 00:45:18,650
I mean, you guys know this. You're all sitting in public hall type environments.

385
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:23,750
Moreover, location matters. There is an interesting story.

386
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:31,850
Very little of this is new these days. You know, this wasn't a particularly bad hurricane season, but the impacts just keep increasing each year.

387
00:45:31,850 --> 00:45:36,110
And it's because we're we like to live in low lying and flood prone areas.

388
00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:41,690
And the amount of development in the last 30 years in Florida is just mind boggling.

389
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:48,920
Okay. We also have a lot of folks at agriculture and other things in drought prone areas.

390
00:45:50,210 --> 00:45:58,580
And we have this notion of you could talk boundaries, but in fact, all of these problems can cross these different boundaries.

391
00:45:59,870 --> 00:46:02,570
Key point on this slide is susceptibility.

392
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:14,930
As an example, we have evidence now how to identify folks who are susceptible, you know, for heat, stress, hypothermia.

393
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:26,320
I've listed some of those that are here. And so we have really good ideas about these.

394
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:32,589
Okay. So that brings me into another way of evaluating some of these impacts.

395
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:35,650
And this is called health impact analysis.

396
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:42,130
Okay. This is not new. This is a formal definition from National Research Council from over a decade ago.

397
00:46:43,450 --> 00:46:50,230
Okay. They define it as a systematic process that uses an array of data, sources and analytical methods.

398
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:55,810
So this is interesting. There's no single method. Lots of methods considers input from stakeholders.

399
00:46:55,810 --> 00:47:04,570
So here's your participation piece to determine the potential effects of a proposed policy plan, program or project on the health of a population.

400
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:11,350
This is almost NEPA language. The difference is that it's the health of a population, so it's much more focused.

401
00:47:14,430 --> 00:47:18,690
And also the distribution of those affects within the population.

402
00:47:18,990 --> 00:47:27,090
So here's the EEG piece coming up. And then each area provides recommendations on monitoring and managing those effects.

403
00:47:31,210 --> 00:47:40,750
The aims of each I am from a slightly more pragmatic perspective are listed below.

404
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:44,260
We want to maximize the health gain or minimize the health loss.

405
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:54,160
We want to be multi-disciplinary, intersectional, intersectional, sectoral, participatory, focused on health inequalities.

406
00:47:55,780 --> 00:48:04,630
The diverse set of tools can be both quantitative and qualitative, but the biggest difference is the bottom.

407
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:17,470
Okay. This is a process which emphasizes sustainability, promotion of health, participation, democracy, equity, and the ethical use of evidence.

408
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:22,150
This is where if you're going to take these definitions,

409
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:31,840
you have to recognize this is like transformative work because it's a process which differs from an EIA.

410
00:48:32,350 --> 00:48:41,190
Anybody can do any idea. Here to do an HRA, you've got to engage the stakeholders in the EIA.

411
00:48:43,110 --> 00:48:48,330
Okay. And there's no finite beginning and end necessarily to it's a continuing process.

412
00:48:53,170 --> 00:49:02,890
Okay. What are the reasons to do something that's transformative? Well, we recognize health is influenced by many broad determinants.

413
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:10,190
We need a systematic approach. We need to engage stakeholders.

414
00:49:11,570 --> 00:49:15,950
We need the data. And then bring health to non-health sectors.

415
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:20,630
There are many sectors of the economy, whatever that are related to our health.

416
00:49:23,930 --> 00:49:26,960
So I love to ask students and public health what affects your health?

417
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:32,810
Okay. You guys know this. Okay. You have these sort of fixed effects.

418
00:49:33,290 --> 00:49:40,880
You have a social economic environment. You have what we traditionally define as environment here, water, social.

419
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:45,590
We have lifestyle and we have services. Okay.

420
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:53,360
And so, you know, we can influence everything here except the fixed part.

421
00:49:54,320 --> 00:50:01,610
And the others are sort of determinants or are the determinants that we have ability to do something about?

422
00:50:05,770 --> 00:50:13,810
This is expanded more in this classic picture of the determinants of health from The Lancet.

423
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:23,410
And, you know, we have sort of layers of things that look how important, you know, the natural environment is, the built environment.

424
00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:29,230
And then, you know, these are the things that we've been talking about and in the global, global ecosystem.

425
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:43,360
Okay. So for each gave this broad definition that I gave you here can be done with many different approaches.

426
00:50:43,370 --> 00:50:49,280
There's no single approach. Okay. But the goal should be to make a health centered assessment.

427
00:50:51,980 --> 00:51:01,250
With a process which is fair. So there are many approaches and uses of HIV information.

428
00:51:01,610 --> 00:51:07,250
You've seen the Burden of Disease Studies, the Institute of Health Metrics in Seattle.

429
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:19,770
There's a benefits assessment. I'll show you an example of that, where we're trying to estimate the impact of a program or a policy.

430
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:22,520
It can be looking forward. It can be looking backward.

431
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:34,730
There is a mandate in the Congress, the U.S. Congress, to estimate the financial impact of any bill that passed.

432
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:44,210
And depending on the administration, that can include health costs if you want.

433
00:51:45,230 --> 00:51:49,400
Okay. But basically, the question is, is the policy worth it?

434
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:56,630
Okay. This is sometimes called accountability research, and it's an important and growing trend.

435
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:08,950
Those are assessments moving forward. You could do a prospective each year for decision making to try to estimate the impacts of a project.

436
00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:15,190
This is very much like EIA and the focus is different though,

437
00:52:15,190 --> 00:52:25,570
because it brings public health into areas which were previously not considered to be primarily oriented to public health like transportation.

438
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:36,470
So in addition to the categories that were used here, we're really replacing them to some extent is the use of health metrics.

439
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:45,630
So an example of accountability research. This one is fairly well-known.

440
00:52:47,550 --> 00:52:57,900
If you look at clean fuel and vehicle rules and EPA as you know, as emission limits for air pollutants,

441
00:52:58,410 --> 00:53:05,670
these apply to the tailpipe and other emissions, non running non tailpipe emissions.

442
00:53:06,510 --> 00:53:07,380
They're expensive.

443
00:53:10,110 --> 00:53:29,310
Looking backwards, in 1999, EPA reduced the amount of sulfur in gasoline to 30 parts per million and in 19 in 2000 to 15 p.m. in diesel fuel.

444
00:53:29,970 --> 00:53:43,980
Why? What's the deal with sulfur? Causes particulate matter emissions when it's burned, it causes CO2.

445
00:53:44,050 --> 00:53:47,980
But in spark ignition engines, these form particles.

446
00:53:52,210 --> 00:53:58,960
EPA estimated the health benefits and all the other benefits and then there's non road equipment as well.

447
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:11,800
And they had a 15 p.m. diesel. EPA estimated the health benefits from these three classes $278 billion per year over the lifetime.

448
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:22,120
Avoid 25,000 cases per year. Premature mortality the cost total 12.

449
00:54:22,850 --> 00:54:25,630
The net benefit is 167.

450
00:54:26,350 --> 00:54:43,300
If you like to do benefit to cost ratios, which is simple, there's 15 to 1 advantage in doing this seems like a world well worthwhile policy.

451
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:53,340
So that's an example of benefits assessment or accountability work. Okay.

452
00:54:53,850 --> 00:55:07,180
Do you agree? Is it that simple? Do we really know any of these numbers?

453
00:55:10,310 --> 00:55:13,730
Could the costs be higher? Sure. Could the benefits be lower?

454
00:55:13,790 --> 00:55:17,300
Sure. Should I use benefit costs as a ratio?

455
00:55:18,530 --> 00:55:21,650
Who are the benefits occurring to who is paying the cost?

456
00:55:22,550 --> 00:55:25,400
Okay. I mean, there's so many things involved. Right.

457
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:37,790
But a 15 to 1 ratio is, you know, if I could get that kind of payback, I would certainly invest right by people not like this.

458
00:55:38,270 --> 00:55:42,620
This is going out to the public. So people, like just not happy with it.

459
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:45,800
Or are most people saying like, let's do this?

460
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:53,720
I think that there are lots of people who would prefer EPA not to do any more regulations on motor vehicles, for sure.

461
00:55:55,190 --> 00:56:04,459
Okay. You know.

462
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:13,430
So again, this is kind of like EIA I'm giving you this information, but it doesn't mean you're going to make the right decision.

463
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:19,729
Okay. And I'm not addressing the decision making process here.

464
00:56:19,730 --> 00:56:21,230
I'm just giving you information.

465
00:56:21,890 --> 00:56:30,890
And I would hope that a reasonably intelligent, objective politician or whatever would make a decision which would support this rule.

466
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:34,950
But there are many that will not. Okay.

467
00:56:38,070 --> 00:56:43,940
Anybody have thoughts on this? So, you know, it's really interesting.

468
00:56:44,630 --> 00:56:58,220
Usually in February each year, a couple of us will go to Washington to lobby our senators and our representatives.

469
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:01,650
Typically, we meet with staffers because that's who you meet with.

470
00:57:01,670 --> 00:57:06,710
But I do occasionally meet with Debbie Dingell or needed to leave or whoever.

471
00:57:07,220 --> 00:57:18,470
And, you know, I can tell them these numbers and, you know, their eyes glaze over because they want to see this, but they don't want to hear it.

472
00:57:18,770 --> 00:57:22,490
You know, what they want are personal stories.

473
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:24,100
Okay.

474
00:57:24,110 --> 00:57:33,830
You have to tell them how somebody you know or even bring somebody you know to the office and say, you know, I really benefited from this policy.

475
00:57:34,670 --> 00:57:38,749
But the 15 to 1 ratio. Sure. But they see numbers like this all the time.

476
00:57:38,750 --> 00:57:43,790
And I don't think they they understand it, but I don't think it's convincing.

477
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:49,450
And Debbie Dingell were seated to leave are two of the most sympathetic people there.

478
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:59,839
And the. Another approach to, oh, I'm sorry, I'm going over.

479
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:04,070
I'll do this one and then stop looking at accountability.

480
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:09,260
Research is to use a program called EPA Burnout Benefits Mapping.

481
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:14,209
And this is kind of a evolving program.

482
00:58:14,210 --> 00:58:20,750
EPA has had it for about ten years, but it keeps getting a little more flexible, though it's not that easy to use.

483
00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:28,070
The idea here is that you define an area, you look at what impacts air quality.

484
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:39,770
You understand what is the population in that area and what their existing rates of disease are because it influences the impacts of air quality.

485
00:58:40,370 --> 00:58:46,700
You feed into this a particular scenario, say I'm going to reduce emissions by X percent on this type of source.

486
00:58:47,780 --> 00:58:50,569
This model then predicts the concentration.

487
00:58:50,570 --> 00:58:59,300
The change in concentration at the population level, uses health impact functions that are represented here,

488
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:08,780
which depend on the population, their existing health and the risk or dose response curve comes up with a change in health.

489
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:16,040
And then, then how has valuation functions to say how much a life is worth, how much a sickness is worth,

490
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:23,480
and estimates of monetary value of that policy and then produces the output there.

491
00:59:24,290 --> 00:59:33,440
So now I can say, yes, this policy will cost $15 billion, but it has a 10 to 1 payoff in terms of health, you know,

492
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:40,700
because I've estimated the monetary value of health and I do this for you in a few slides down the road.

493
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:47,750
I have never brought this to a politician before. It's too complicated.

494
00:59:51,390 --> 00:59:54,710
But it's something that's out there. It's a regular tool.

495
00:59:55,080 --> 01:00:01,300
And EPA has to do something like this, too, for any proposed legislation.

496
01:00:01,890 --> 01:00:10,710
I should say EPA. Congress has to do something like this because they're supposed to provide through some sort of objective assessment.

497
01:00:11,010 --> 01:00:14,160
What is the impact and cost of a regulation?

498
01:00:16,570 --> 01:00:19,660
Okay. Very tight again. Going over 5 minutes.

499
01:00:19,930 --> 01:00:25,660
But I have homework from Fiona and Anna.

500
01:00:26,980 --> 01:00:37,050
Yeah. Even.

501
01:00:41,150 --> 01:00:55,420
The whole. I thought, you know, extra credit there.

502
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:58,840
Something about what you mentioned earlier. I think so.

503
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:03,100
Oh, okay. Have a plus. Sure.

504
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:21,350
Let's do that. I think it's great. I had a good portion of our question to Park City talking about the command center for the toxic chemical release.

505
01:01:21,790 --> 01:01:30,319
Mm hmm. I guess I have a question for the command center, actually, to find the cafeteria floor where we need it to be.

506
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:33,720
Away from the floor? Yeah, I wasn't playing.

507
01:01:33,750 --> 01:01:43,010
Yeah, no, that's a great question. I should talk about that. Typically, what happens is if you're responding, as you know,

508
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:51,290
to a fire or an explosion or whatever, the first responders need to agree on the command center.

509
01:01:51,950 --> 01:01:57,650
Okay. It's a physical place where they're going to actually be able to observe, dispatch people or whatever.

510
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:02,630
So typically, you don't want this to be downwind, okay?

511
01:02:03,290 --> 01:02:06,740
Because you have to move. In that case, you don't want to be in the path of the fire.

512
01:02:07,790 --> 01:02:11,870
So you want it to be in a more protected area, but close.

513
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:20,420
Yeah. I wasn't sure if it's New York capturing because something you probably want to downwind but yeah you know that's a great, great.

514
01:02:21,170 --> 01:02:34,610
So I, I guess I'm thinking kind of as an incident command where you have this scalable approach to deal with disasters.

515
01:02:35,090 --> 01:02:42,530
And so there's it's actually you may not be very interested in this.

516
01:02:42,530 --> 01:02:42,920
I don't know.

517
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:52,250
But, you know, when you're right on top of a like a fire or something like that, you have a very interesting perspective about what's taking place.

518
01:02:52,820 --> 01:03:00,469
And nowadays with drones and cameras and things like this, you get all these different types of perspectives.

519
01:03:00,470 --> 01:03:09,230
And it's conceivable that you could say, oh, you don't have to be near there at all, you know, but traditionally, you're you're right there.

520
01:03:09,730 --> 01:04:37,040
Yeah. So one of the questions on the homework, it says like, calculus allows me an indeterminate stability and it gives us the the wind speed,

521
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:40,970
the fact that it's 10 a.m. and that there's 10% cloud cover.

522
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:44,510
So that's how I determined the stability for this or that.

523
01:04:44,510 --> 01:04:47,600
There's a different chart that I have for this one.

524
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:51,480
This is what you mean. Okay. And 10%.

525
01:04:52,370 --> 01:04:55,549
Yeah. Okay. So so that's right.

526
01:04:55,550 --> 01:05:06,890
Left and also and what's on it was at 10 a.m. so I was getting day strong and it was at 4:04 p.m.

527
01:05:07,370 --> 01:05:10,670
No, sorry. At four meters per second. Okay.

528
01:05:11,690 --> 01:05:19,460
So I said yeah or see I mean what's the mutation rate and what's with the date?

529
01:05:20,540 --> 01:05:24,800
June 1018. Yeah. Okay, so this is definitely be good.

530
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:34,519
Okay. What actually have a lot of question but you know, if you were unsure then you could use the screen model three,

531
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:41,830
you could then plug it in because it has a calculator for the cycle.

532
01:05:42,770 --> 01:05:52,400
Okay. And so, you know, if I took that condition the similar in verses in Florida, I'd have a different level of sun intensity.

533
01:05:53,150 --> 01:05:56,990
Right. Right. Okay. In Detroit. Gotcha.

534
01:05:57,140 --> 01:06:07,210
Yeah. So on that same question, you talking about the stability class, which would be for having that, but that also has to last that out.

535
01:06:07,220 --> 01:06:12,290
And based on the rate we calculated, it would be like it would be very.

536
01:06:14,250 --> 01:06:17,690
He's very stable. Okay, nice.

537
01:06:18,630 --> 01:06:22,740
Is that? I I'm not sure I remember to be here.

538
01:06:23,790 --> 01:06:30,000
This is confusing. Like how how to know if something is stable or unstable based on the classroom.

539
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:33,929
Like, based on the actual value you got. Yeah.

540
01:06:33,930 --> 01:06:43,170
So I can give you a chart of the labs rate range for different stabilities if that would help you.

541
01:06:43,470 --> 01:06:47,190
That would be, I think. Okay. And slides would have like two different lines.

542
01:06:47,970 --> 01:06:51,540
Yeah. I don't know that those are mine for actual. Yeah.

543
01:06:52,790 --> 01:06:56,790
Right. So I'll, I'll send you a table. Okay.

544
01:07:02,050 --> 01:07:07,200
Yeah. Cause I remember being for sure. This is pressure and temperature.

545
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:20,160
He is. Okay.

546
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:26,430
Let's scare. Let's presume. Okay.

547
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:36,220
So back to Ben Maps. So I'm anticipating in a couple of years, Ben Map is going to be updated a lot more.

548
01:07:36,460 --> 01:07:40,270
Right now, you have to throw into this a lot of data sets so nobody uses it.

549
01:07:40,690 --> 01:07:55,230
So it's not automatic. Turning to prospective HIV AIDS, the process that's recommended usually follows these seven steps.

550
01:07:55,710 --> 01:08:01,440
This looks just like EIA. Okay, we have a screening step.

551
01:08:02,940 --> 01:08:07,080
What are we trying to do? We should be involved. We have a scoping step.

552
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:11,490
Again, just like you. We have now an assessment step.

553
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:15,480
This is like the baseline investigation, same as it year.

554
01:08:15,930 --> 01:08:19,770
We do recommendations, reporting,

555
01:08:19,770 --> 01:08:27,030
evaluation and monitoring the parts that differ or the monitoring is excluded from

556
01:08:27,030 --> 01:08:31,470
an ERISA or an EIA because it's an open and shut case once the thing is done,

557
01:08:32,220 --> 01:08:40,650
and then the assessment uses a much more flexible approach and it can be done on an ongoing manner as well.

558
01:08:41,070 --> 01:08:49,620
But in general, the steps are similar. Okay. And this is really, again, just following a systematic approach to think broadly.

559
01:08:49,950 --> 01:08:57,569
Figure out what matters and then move forward on that. In here.

560
01:08:57,570 --> 01:09:01,500
There's a couple of definitions that I find as key definitions for folks

561
01:09:02,370 --> 01:09:07,830
attributable health burden when we're looking at impact of a project or a policy.

562
01:09:08,490 --> 01:09:11,520
This is the reduction in the current disease burden.

563
01:09:13,410 --> 01:09:17,460
The avoidable health burden is a potential reduction in the health burden.

564
01:09:19,430 --> 01:09:29,309
Okay. So it's pretty much follows what the words are. And then for your information here, I define this mathematically.

565
01:09:29,310 --> 01:09:35,070
The attributable risk. Attributable fraction. You guys have heard of disability adjusted life years.

566
01:09:35,490 --> 01:09:44,090
Okay. And so we would take the years of life lost and the years of life lived with disability,

567
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:48,030
add them together to get the daily disability adjusted life years.

568
01:09:48,990 --> 01:09:54,090
Okay. Does Debbie Dingell or Rashida Tlaib understand dialysis?

569
01:09:54,660 --> 01:10:03,180
I don't know. I never asked. I should in the scoping process.

570
01:10:03,570 --> 01:10:04,910
Again, it's pretty similar.

571
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:14,850
Maybe there's more attention in identifying the populations or communities that would be most vulnerable and potentially most affected.

572
01:10:16,470 --> 01:10:21,780
And then there is a very explicit step to try to describe their baseline status,

573
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:28,230
their health status and demographics, which is maybe a positive use of the word profiling.

574
01:10:29,220 --> 01:10:38,410
Okay. And that's in the scoping study in the risk assessment or the appraisal step.

575
01:10:39,010 --> 01:10:42,670
Again, we're trying to look at both negative and positive outcomes here.

576
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:47,650
And there are a slew of different types of techniques that can be used.

577
01:10:48,010 --> 01:10:58,420
And, you know, everything from AP studies to community surveys to some rapid assessment sort of techniques, which are just checklists that people use.

578
01:11:03,630 --> 01:11:08,910
I'm going to skip over preparing a report and jump to monitoring and evaluation.

579
01:11:08,910 --> 01:11:15,510
And again, this is where HIPAA differs from this because it's very much involved with a process.

580
01:11:15,870 --> 01:11:20,640
So there is a process evaluation step to see how successful.

581
01:11:22,070 --> 01:11:30,050
The process was was everyone included were all concerns addressed wasn't seen as being objective.

582
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:40,480
This is completely missing from me. The impact evaluation monitors, the acceptance of the recommendations, the implementation of the recommendations.

583
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:48,940
Again, this is different from NEPA. NEPA is a document, whether it's used or not, up to decision maker here.

584
01:11:48,940 --> 01:11:53,320
There's an explicit step to include this evaluation step.

585
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:59,110
And then finally, the third difference is outcome evaluation.

586
01:11:59,890 --> 01:12:04,120
So we monitor the health and the environment in the area.

587
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:12,880
And are things improving the way we expect? Again, a big difference for people overall and questions.

588
01:12:12,890 --> 01:12:17,350
I'm just curious on the process evaluation, is that different?

589
01:12:17,430 --> 01:12:23,770
Does that differ by project or is it kind of the same sort of like rubric for evaluation,

590
01:12:23,770 --> 01:12:30,430
if you will, like that gets applied to each time you do and it can be different?

591
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:42,430
Okay. So typically the way we would do this is that after each sort of phase, each hire will go out and survey the participants, the community,

592
01:12:42,850 --> 01:12:55,780
and get a sense of their engagement in the process, their knowledge of the process, their perception regarding equity and pattern and so forth.

593
01:12:55,900 --> 01:13:02,170
Okay, throughout the processes for how successful it was, it'll be a metric or metrics for that.

594
01:13:03,010 --> 01:13:07,530
You know, in contrast, the is it's there's nothing like this.

595
01:13:07,590 --> 01:13:10,990
There's no process evaluation at all. Okay.

596
01:13:11,380 --> 01:13:15,360
Thank you. This is radical for government, okay.

597
01:13:15,620 --> 01:13:19,690
Because, you know, government doesn't want to evaluate itself.

598
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:23,110
Right. Can you trust government to evaluate itself?

599
01:13:23,110 --> 01:13:33,970
It's another issue, too. So, you know, in the last decade, I guess we've been doing this in Detroit, addressing air quality issues.

600
01:13:35,500 --> 01:13:40,870
Obviously, it's quite complex. As you know, transport, this is part of the bridge thing.

601
01:13:40,870 --> 01:13:45,639
There's a lot of industry that's part of that. I mean, there are multiple sources.

602
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:54,879
There are issues with this too ozone, ppm, toxics, formaldehyde, etc. depending on how you define the boundaries.

603
01:13:54,880 --> 01:14:02,320
There's at least 40,000 people near many of these sources, but could be much larger.

604
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:07,960
And we know there are health impacts associated with these air pollutants and vulnerable communities.

605
01:14:09,130 --> 01:14:19,270
So over the past, like I said, nearly ten years, our community actions promote healthy environments.

606
01:14:19,750 --> 01:14:28,570
Acronym Project has done many of these different steps and come up with recommendations.

607
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:33,790
And these are the top ten recommendations that we have for this portion of Detroit.

608
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:47,000
And we are engaged currently in several of these areas, you know,

609
01:14:47,020 --> 01:14:56,890
where there's really a community led process which is dealing with diesel engine retrofits, with EPA funding and idling controls.

610
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:08,380
Um, there is now a city led project dealing with some of the transit and transportation measures, primarily dealing with trucking routes.

611
01:15:09,610 --> 01:15:19,480
Uh, we have Detroit public schools, Dearborn and our own installing filters and buildings.

612
01:15:20,650 --> 01:15:25,180
Uh, this hasn't gotten too far. And buffers and barriers at this point.

613
01:15:25,930 --> 01:15:29,650
And compliance, as always, is not changing.

614
01:15:29,980 --> 01:15:34,660
And we've added many additional monitors to document what's going on.

615
01:15:35,410 --> 01:15:42,850
So kind of over these ten years, I would say we've had, you know, seven or six successes out of the ten recommendations.

616
01:15:42,850 --> 01:15:48,400
So at least partial successes. So I want to show you some of the sources.

617
01:15:49,490 --> 01:15:54,940
Um, air pollution sources, primarily all burning coal.

618
01:15:55,330 --> 01:15:58,360
Dte's announced, uh, these will close.

619
01:15:58,360 --> 01:16:09,509
The U.S. steel facility is. Largely mothballed.

620
01:16:09,510 --> 01:16:16,980
It's the Sevastopol Steel which was just bought by somebody else, which is still operating.

621
01:16:21,070 --> 01:16:33,370
And in terms of some of the techniques, we estimate that about 7.3% of the deaths in Wayne County, which surrounds Detroit, are due to air pollutants.

622
01:16:34,030 --> 01:16:40,480
And this rate is actually not that much higher than what occurs in the rest of the country.

623
01:16:42,250 --> 01:16:52,720
But there are certainly pockets of greater susceptibility and vulnerability due to both high rates of existing disease and obesity and smoking,

624
01:16:53,170 --> 01:16:58,980
as well as poverty and a large minority population.

625
01:16:58,990 --> 01:17:04,720
And the juxtaposition of these pollution sources with housing.

626
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:09,370
And so not to belabor this too much,

627
01:17:09,370 --> 01:17:22,030
but basically these estimates were obtained by taking data sets spatially disaggregated for exposure for baseline health,

628
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:26,980
baseline rates of disease, population density from the census.

629
01:17:27,490 --> 01:17:32,290
Putting that together, getting those tallies, monetizing them.

630
01:17:32,650 --> 01:17:37,060
And then we can look also at measures of equity.

631
01:17:37,540 --> 01:17:48,040
And this is a bit beyond where I want to talk about these acts and concentration indices have to do with how fair the situation is.

632
01:17:48,940 --> 01:17:59,260
And high values typically mean that it's variables limiting or existing problems with disproportionate impacts.

633
01:18:01,210 --> 01:18:03,250
For me, I like tables.

634
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:18,970
We estimate, for example, all cause mortality to be uh, uh, uh, third one here in the county, but then associated with air pollution is again 7%.

635
01:18:19,150 --> 01:18:27,010
This is actually a little bit lower than an estimate that EPA provided a few years ago using been map for asthma.

636
01:18:29,020 --> 01:18:35,830
These numbers of cases are quite high, but asthma is not life threatening for most kids.

637
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:42,880
So even though the number of cases is high, the monetary impacts aren't that large.

638
01:18:43,330 --> 01:18:52,330
However, we don't really know very accurately what happens when a kid misses a day of school because of an asthma attack.

639
01:18:52,630 --> 01:18:55,870
Okay, so this is something that's not well quantified.

640
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:03,290
And then continuing with the asthma.

641
01:19:04,490 --> 01:19:07,340
If we do monetize it, monetize it.

642
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:15,920
It does sum up, but this again, is a somewhat speculative number because of the lack of information of how to account for the cost.

643
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:24,590
So this is kind of an accountability assessment or a burden of disease assessment.

644
01:19:24,950 --> 01:19:29,839
And just some of the summaries of some of the points were summarized on the slide.

645
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:33,770
So I don't really need to go through this again. Okay.

646
01:19:33,780 --> 01:19:38,030
So I've given you a couple examples of using some of these health impact assessment techniques,

647
01:19:38,030 --> 01:19:44,840
one with the Detroit study, the other being with EPA fuels and the benefit of reducing sulfur.

648
01:19:45,260 --> 01:19:54,870
Good questions on those. It's interesting that the bottom line is we take the health impact and we monetize it.

649
01:19:56,890 --> 01:20:01,030
Okay. Which is kind of interesting because it doesn't have to be that way.

650
01:20:02,110 --> 01:20:05,440
Okay. But that seems to have the most power when you talk to people.

651
01:20:12,610 --> 01:20:17,950
Okay. So I showed you some good things about this. Okay. Now, on the other side, there's bad things.

652
01:20:18,190 --> 01:20:22,270
Okay. Doing these health impact assessments is not easy.

653
01:20:22,870 --> 01:20:31,630
Some of the methods demand a lot of data. It can be very challenging to get that data can be very challenging to provide an analysis that makes sense.

654
01:20:34,260 --> 01:20:40,770
We have lots of other issues. The pace of doing the HIIT may not match the pace of decision making.

655
01:20:41,250 --> 01:20:46,170
I might be making a decision this year, but I can't do this work because I don't have all the data together.

656
01:20:46,710 --> 01:20:51,600
It's not very helpful. Public participation is not easy.

657
01:20:52,350 --> 01:20:57,930
There are procedural but not substantive requirements.

658
01:20:58,260 --> 01:21:04,770
I guess what I mean by that is that health impact assessments don't have a mandate.

659
01:21:05,130 --> 01:21:08,250
Okay. It's kind of a voluntary activity at this point.

660
01:21:12,180 --> 01:21:20,610
Agencies lack public health expertise. This is where you guys, I hope, will get into the agencies and provide that expertise.

661
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:28,560
Right now, there's a huge gap and then clearly there is an additional burden for doing this work.

662
01:21:28,710 --> 01:21:35,100
And that is another countervailing force against performing HIV AIDS.

663
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:40,560
Okay, so I just have a couple of more slides. Okay. We'll be done.

664
01:21:41,970 --> 01:21:57,480
All right. HIV requires a host of different types of activities for success and takes a lot of different types of inputs as well.

665
01:21:57,960 --> 01:22:02,610
And this is just a schema to try to think about some of those.

666
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:10,770
And they include encompassing the environmental justice concerns, maybe the health and all policies.

667
01:22:12,420 --> 01:22:16,200
From a technical standpoint, you need technical skills.

668
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:20,760
You're going to depend on getting different agencies to cooperate.

669
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:31,739
You want engagement with communities and stakeholders and of course, to have some impact through sort of a top down legislative process.

670
01:22:31,740 --> 01:22:44,200
You need to have some political will here. So just like I did with EIA, it can be pretty strange.

671
01:22:44,630 --> 01:22:48,860
It's evidence based. It uses the best science that we have.

672
01:22:50,510 --> 01:22:55,220
It's goal directed toward long term goals of sustainability, including health and equity.

673
01:22:56,090 --> 01:23:01,940
It's people centered. It encompasses pretty much any kind of technical tool that you might want to bring to it.

674
01:23:02,540 --> 01:23:08,000
And it's a systematic process which can be considered a learning process as well.

675
01:23:09,110 --> 01:23:13,220
Downside nobody is making you do this right now.

676
01:23:14,090 --> 01:23:22,010
There's no piece of legislation at the federal level and only nascent efforts at a couple of state levels to do something like this.

677
01:23:25,080 --> 01:23:28,290
You know, the EIA has a checklist.

678
01:23:28,650 --> 01:23:32,100
You have to do primary effects. You have to do secondary effects.

679
01:23:32,100 --> 01:23:36,240
You have to look at resources irretrievably lost, all these checkmarks.

680
01:23:36,690 --> 01:23:39,770
There's nothing like this for each writer. Okay.

681
01:23:39,780 --> 01:23:51,570
So there's a lot of discretion in terms of what you might include. There's many different types of toolkits, but there's a short history of use.

682
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:56,520
There's concerns with public participation in education, literacy.

683
01:23:57,300 --> 01:24:01,650
So it's another kind of hurdle or a hurdle here.

684
01:24:03,630 --> 01:24:07,930
The accuracy of predictions is always something that can be questioned.

685
01:24:09,060 --> 01:24:16,560
The dependance on the experience and the skills of the stakeholders and the assessments is particularly important.

686
01:24:17,220 --> 01:24:22,200
Okay. And of course, there can be competing interests of the stakeholders.

687
01:24:22,620 --> 01:24:29,820
And, you know, like anything else, there's a certain amount of data and time and money contentiousness that this takes.

688
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:34,140
So, you know, there's no free lunch. Everything has pros and cons.

689
01:24:34,260 --> 01:24:37,560
So I tried to organize what some of the strengths and some of the weaknesses are.

690
01:24:41,670 --> 01:24:52,410
And that's it. The only thing that this slide will pull out was this notion of cumulative effects and E.J.

691
01:24:52,680 --> 01:24:56,600
And that could be folded right into this as well. Okay.

692
01:24:59,730 --> 01:25:05,760
So I anticipate you guys may be involved in HIV AIDS in one context or another,

693
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:11,160
whether it's using a simplified approach or whether it's using a very detailed approach.

694
01:25:12,150 --> 01:25:17,220
I think it's a logical extension to something like NEPA because it makes it health center.

695
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:28,170
Yeah, it has pretty much grown up to look to you to do or to the company, since it doesn't really seem like they have legal requirements.

696
01:25:28,260 --> 01:25:32,940
It's been really interesting question for a reason you probably don't suspect.

697
01:25:33,210 --> 01:25:36,900
I've never seen a company do one of these. Okay. Okay.

698
01:25:38,730 --> 01:25:45,450
And if a company is saying, oh, I have a 15 to 1 cost benefit ratio,

699
01:25:45,900 --> 01:25:49,200
they're going to want and people are going to want to know, why have you already done this?

700
01:25:49,200 --> 01:25:51,990
And how come it's not 1000 to 1, you know?

701
01:25:52,530 --> 01:26:00,720
So these are the driver for these are coming mostly from the community level and from the environmental justice community.

702
01:26:01,060 --> 01:26:11,720
Okay. Because they feel like they've been they've gotten the short end of the shaft from everything else.

703
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:27,790
But, you know, I just I was wondering, like, how do people I guess I like compare a global context?

704
01:26:27,790 --> 01:26:38,770
Like, do other OPEC nations have like significantly stronger pieces of legislation for these sort of like evaluation and valuations?

705
01:26:39,100 --> 01:26:49,270
That's a great question. Um, I, I think I always came in Europe and in Europe, the system is set up a little differently.

706
01:26:49,900 --> 01:26:58,750
Um, there is an emphasis, there's one which is not so different in many regards,

707
01:26:59,050 --> 01:27:06,880
but there's also a much stronger in theory, um, environmental set of environmental protections.

708
01:27:08,050 --> 01:27:12,070
Okay. Now the problem is, is that in theory, okay?

709
01:27:12,130 --> 01:27:20,260
And it doesn't really drive down to the level of fixing what's already out there, which is another issue.

710
01:27:22,210 --> 01:27:30,940
But if you are, for example, proposing a new facility, then you have to comply with applicable rules.

711
01:27:31,330 --> 01:27:34,510
And some of those are much stricter than what we have in this country.

712
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:41,240
Uh, in terms of assessments. That's a really interesting question.

713
01:27:41,450 --> 01:27:48,620
I would say I would have answered ten years ago that the US had a much better track record of

714
01:27:48,620 --> 01:27:56,210
assessments of both pragmatic programmatic sort of permitting type level and research level.

715
01:27:56,630 --> 01:28:00,200
And there had been some advancements in Europe, which are pretty amazing.

716
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:05,210
And so at this point, I'm not sure that what you're saying.

717
01:28:12,690 --> 01:28:21,160
Yeah. I think this field is moving pretty fast and globally.

718
01:28:22,030 --> 01:28:26,850
I think that many folks are still using the framework.

719
01:28:27,820 --> 01:28:31,300
Okay, because it was very prescriptive and it looked like it was effective.

720
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:40,780
But it's hard to give you a global view from the point of view, but that's sort of my impression, the thinking.

721
01:28:50,630 --> 01:29:05,670
Okay. Homework questions if you're going to have folks practice. I got a couple of questions about travel time and stuff like that.

722
01:29:06,720 --> 01:29:11,130
Okay. For the plume in the groundwater. Any questions about that?

723
01:29:20,410 --> 01:29:21,960
Yeah. The question. I know.

724
01:29:23,690 --> 01:29:32,140
When calculating the worst case level, you just mean how deep it goes into it, or how much the concentration of her can help.

725
01:29:32,180 --> 01:29:35,270
And more and more. Yeah.

726
01:29:35,270 --> 01:29:44,690
I would assume worst case would be using sort of realistic assumptions.

727
01:29:45,290 --> 01:29:48,470
Okay. Not crazy assumptions. Okay.

728
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:53,240
And you need to support what your assumptions are.

729
01:29:53,720 --> 01:29:58,580
Okay. So I'm not sure which question you're asking about.

730
01:29:58,580 --> 01:30:12,830
Article one is going to be mentioned for petrol pipeline and ethanol chemical spills.

731
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:19,820
Right. And everybody should have gotten my announcement that it was a thousand liters per year.

732
01:30:20,390 --> 01:30:29,510
So you could just assume there's a constant rate of this chemical being seeping downward and then being advocated horizontally.

733
01:30:29,720 --> 01:30:37,670
Okay. So I'm sorry, what was your question? A worst case scenario is, I mean, how deep or how much or the boat.

734
01:30:38,370 --> 01:30:42,770
Well, it may not be how deep.

735
01:30:43,790 --> 01:30:49,610
That may not be really helpful. Okay. Because what you need to figure out is how fast it's migrating.

736
01:30:51,570 --> 01:30:56,400
Okay. And so to do that, you need to use Darcy's law.

737
01:30:57,060 --> 01:31:08,310
Right. And so Darcy as well will tell you how many years it takes to migrate based on the hydraulic gradient, the hydraulic conductivity.

738
01:31:08,940 --> 01:31:17,970
Okay, which you need to calculate, and the distance and the poor velocity.

739
01:31:19,470 --> 01:31:28,800
Okay. Remember, Darcy's law gives you the walk velocity, so you need to divide by the porosity to get the velocity.

740
01:31:30,810 --> 01:31:34,290
Okay. And then what contaminant are you looking at?

741
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:39,850
Well, asking for help. Okay.

742
01:31:39,880 --> 01:31:44,680
Thinking more severe than you're thinking.

743
01:31:45,100 --> 01:31:49,570
Perkins More severe than ethanol. Just because it's constant.

744
01:31:49,910 --> 01:31:56,990
Hmm. And ethanol. Just once but is a big part of this I think that getting to.

745
01:31:59,120 --> 01:32:06,820
Mm hmm. Well, yeah. So, I mean, you can there's a couple of ways to do this, okay?

746
01:32:07,090 --> 01:32:14,190
One is to, you know, if you assume worst case, then you're assuming a conservative contaminant, right?

747
01:32:14,220 --> 01:32:20,230
No, it doesn't break down. Um, I guess I'm okay with that, but it's not very realistic.

748
01:32:20,830 --> 01:32:23,889
Right. Because ethanol's going to break down pretty quickly.

749
01:32:23,890 --> 01:32:33,220
Perc is not. And you can get estimates of bio half life and things like this if you wanted to impress me.

750
01:32:33,370 --> 01:32:42,190
Okay. Um, and then in terms of travel time, you should think about retardation.

751
01:32:43,570 --> 01:32:58,149
Okay. Because the soil content, uh, is got a carbon content and the prime point or one gram per gram, right.

752
01:32:58,150 --> 01:33:05,710
So 0.1 milligram per gram, that's low, but it's influential nonetheless on an organic contaminant.

753
01:33:06,250 --> 01:33:18,250
So thinking about the retardation, which I think there's a worked out from in the notes, but the retardation, you know,

754
01:33:18,790 --> 01:33:26,620
it depends on the distribution coefficient or KDE and the density and the carbon content and the porosity, the soil.

755
01:33:27,610 --> 01:33:31,240
Okay. And so there's a simple equation here that.

756
01:33:33,890 --> 01:33:39,770
You know what the ferocity is. I don't know if I gave you the distribution coefficient.

757
01:33:45,450 --> 01:33:50,310
Again. Is that okay? That's okay. Did I give you clear hydraulic conductivity?

758
01:33:50,490 --> 01:33:56,550
Yeah. No, I. But that's not the distribution coefficient, which was Katie, you know.

759
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:03,299
Okay. So if you want to impress me, you can go to any one of many calculators and see what it is.

760
01:34:03,300 --> 01:34:15,780
Katie. Okay. And then apply that in that or reduce the perc travel time or increase it rather significantly.

761
01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:22,139
So we're looking for the community of what exactly perc and ethanol.

762
01:34:22,140 --> 01:34:26,760
But ethanol doesn't have one, so doesn't have much of one.

763
01:34:28,740 --> 01:34:33,330
Okay. And you understand why? I mean, ethanol is miserable, right?

764
01:34:33,540 --> 01:34:36,839
It's going to flow just like the water does.

765
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:39,120
Okay. It's basically going to be dissolved completely.

766
01:34:39,510 --> 01:34:46,950
Well, perc will dissolve, but it will really be happier absorbing to a body that contains carbon,

767
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:52,110
you know, a body, not a body, but, you know, and so that will slow it down.

768
01:34:52,110 --> 01:34:55,410
And the assumption with retardation is it's reversible formation.

769
01:34:56,010 --> 01:35:05,850
So it'll come off as the water flows past it. And I'm sorry, I don't have that, Katie, for that, but there are lots of calculators for that.

770
01:35:11,670 --> 01:35:13,690
I think that's okay. Okay.

771
01:35:13,710 --> 01:35:19,740
And then, you know, just to fill this one out, so it's got to flow through the groundwater and then it's picked up in the river.

772
01:35:19,770 --> 01:35:24,030
Right. And then brought to the water into it. Yeah.

773
01:35:25,110 --> 01:35:28,429
Um, regarding overseas law, what we need to know area?

774
01:35:28,430 --> 01:35:32,400
A low cross-sectional area for that problem.

775
01:35:32,520 --> 01:35:36,420
Yeah, well, it's a good question, but think about it, okay?

776
01:35:36,720 --> 01:35:41,370
I mean, if you assume a large cross-sectional area or a small cross-sectional area, what differs?

777
01:35:42,870 --> 01:35:46,710
Well, the area, obviously. Right. But I mean, it's all flowing towards the river.

778
01:35:46,720 --> 01:36:03,250
Right. So what is it different? The reason this is hard to describe without a picture.

779
01:36:07,550 --> 01:36:11,120
So here's the river flowing this way.

780
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:16,640
Here's the spill, the gradient. Let's just assume it's perpendicular.

781
01:36:17,960 --> 01:36:27,770
Right? So it's going to flow towards the river directly. So you have a trend line in the circle that goes from here to here.

782
01:36:28,190 --> 01:36:34,710
If your water intake is here, you have a travel time from here to here in the river.

783
01:36:35,030 --> 01:36:43,220
That's right. So if I had a spill, I mean, typically these bills are occurring.

784
01:36:43,310 --> 01:36:51,980
That's the scenario here. Right here. Yeah. So, I mean, two dry cleaners, you know, acre hectare, something small, relatively small.

785
01:36:52,380 --> 01:37:01,400
Right. I don't know exactly where because that's going to flow perpendicular to the lines.

786
01:37:02,150 --> 01:37:10,370
There will be some dispersion and that would have an effect of diluting things a little bit.

787
01:37:11,270 --> 01:37:15,260
But basically, this front is moving towards the river more or less the same speed.

788
01:37:25,440 --> 01:37:28,890
Here's the underground storage tank in relation to all of this.

789
01:37:29,750 --> 01:37:35,280
I think it's the same spot. Okay. But he's okay with it.

790
01:37:35,550 --> 01:37:39,240
Okay. You love a good reason.

791
01:37:39,240 --> 01:37:43,230
Like always. Yeah. Yeah. I was having a really hard time drawing this out.

792
01:37:43,260 --> 01:37:46,980
Like, my notes are just kind of. Yes, I know. Does that help?

793
01:37:47,340 --> 01:37:56,360
Yeah. I mean, that's all you really need. But but it is interesting because this is reduced to really a one day model in many regards.

794
01:37:57,150 --> 01:38:02,070
Okay. And I'm going to think about this problem.

795
01:38:02,070 --> 01:38:17,500
Is this a stage to the dynamic from. Initially, the small screen, right, the plume goes down, hits the ground, water, travels laterally.

796
01:38:18,070 --> 01:38:22,180
Okay, the front advances. So all that's changing in time, right.

797
01:38:22,930 --> 01:38:28,690
But what happens once this plume is established from this river here?

798
01:38:32,050 --> 01:38:35,320
And just consider the dispersants.

799
01:38:35,950 --> 01:38:39,940
Dispersants breaks down. But then this problem has gone on for many years.

800
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:45,220
So the next year, it's going to look exactly the same year after that's going to look the same.

801
01:38:45,430 --> 01:38:50,680
So based on the way this problem is set up, it looks like initially it's dynamic.

802
01:38:50,680 --> 01:38:57,040
Something is changing, the front is moving, the place is becoming contaminated and the leak isn't discovered for many years.

803
01:38:57,280 --> 01:39:00,610
And during those many years it looks like a steady state from.

804
01:39:06,780 --> 01:39:16,170
Yes. This might be a very simple question for you when going back to talking about calculating the worst case levels.

805
01:39:16,290 --> 01:39:19,590
Mm hmm. So you're looking for, like, a concentration in that, right? Mm hmm.

806
01:39:19,860 --> 01:39:26,230
So concentration is one based on some of those I know.

807
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:30,390
Same concentration in general, but in, like, a river, it's a little harder for me.

808
01:39:30,810 --> 01:39:34,740
But if you take flux over flow. Right, that's one way.

809
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:43,170
Yeah, you could do that. You have to have units of, you know, contaminant mass divided by the volume of the river.

810
01:39:44,460 --> 01:39:50,010
Right. Okay. Because you want to express the concentrations and, you know, micrograms per liter or something like that.

811
01:39:51,180 --> 01:40:01,800
So essentially, we take the density to convert the leaders into mass and then we use the flow information to find the volume.

812
01:40:02,190 --> 01:40:05,759
Mm hmm. Well, you can do that. Mm hmm. Because the rivers flow.

813
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:09,280
The rivers, the river flow is known. Right.

814
01:40:09,330 --> 01:40:13,800
Or at least I gave you a hydro graph there. I just.

815
01:40:13,890 --> 01:40:17,340
I don't know how else to find the volume of the river.

816
01:40:20,230 --> 01:40:23,959
It's not so much a volume, it's the flow rate. Oh, no.

817
01:40:23,960 --> 01:40:27,520
I asked about our story. Yeah, because, you know.

818
01:40:32,320 --> 01:40:37,940
If you want to get a concentration view of the mask, the volume is very right.

819
01:40:38,050 --> 01:40:50,400
And so, you know, one way to do that would be the flux rate here, which is a mask or mask complying divided by the flow rate per time.

820
01:40:51,450 --> 01:41:03,180
Okay. And it's better to give these units so we might be dealing with, I don't know, the programs or whatever per year.

821
01:41:04,530 --> 01:41:08,160
And by that, I, I don't know what the flow rate is given that.

822
01:41:08,520 --> 01:41:16,079
Well, it could be years cubed per year over years.

823
01:41:16,080 --> 01:41:20,280
Cancer I mass over volume, which is what you want.

824
01:41:21,720 --> 01:41:27,420
This is exactly like the first dilution example that we gave you in the Surface Order unit.

825
01:41:30,730 --> 01:41:35,560
And you said for the perk it was a thousand per year.

826
01:41:35,830 --> 01:41:39,610
Yeah, I think that makes your life a lot easier. It does.

827
01:41:42,280 --> 01:41:49,430
But then for the ethanol. I guess it says it occurred roughly over a year.

828
01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:54,360
So we just take the 60,000 per year for that to even though that happened.

829
01:41:55,870 --> 01:42:00,450
But. Hmm. That's not going to give you a very good answer.

830
01:42:00,520 --> 01:42:05,860
Yeah. Yeah. So how do we know how?

831
01:42:08,540 --> 01:42:18,140
How much has like decreased over the years? Well, in the way I set up the problem statement here is that at least for one year only.

832
01:42:18,950 --> 01:42:22,370
Right. And then the leak was discovered and they fixed it and it's gone.

833
01:42:24,160 --> 01:42:27,580
Service is a single event, if you will.

834
01:42:29,050 --> 01:42:35,680
If you want to make the assumption that it takes a year to completely leak out so you can use the steady state model.

835
01:42:36,460 --> 01:42:55,540
Okay, you can do that. So the couple of approaches for doing this would be to in that case, you have a former coworker.

836
01:42:58,720 --> 01:43:07,090
Which comes out and the next year, the next year and the next year and one year we had similar.

837
01:43:08,230 --> 01:43:11,650
Okay. If it takes multiple years to get there, I don't remember what the answers.

838
01:43:17,600 --> 01:43:21,210
So your your worst case would be assuming, you know,

839
01:43:21,290 --> 01:43:31,460
that this plume hits the river and lasts for one year and storms there so much and you can calculate the concentration.

840
01:43:31,760 --> 01:43:45,010
That's a reasonable assumption. What's important in ethanol's case is to recognize that this is a not a conservative.

841
01:43:45,660 --> 01:44:00,060
Right. And my little picture there, probably not very accurate because this would tend to disperse a little bit and grow as a sport over time.

842
01:44:01,410 --> 01:44:06,180
And realistically, you know, it's better representative for the distribution.

843
01:44:07,650 --> 01:44:21,180
But the way one way to solve this would be the EPA landfill, to which I mentioned in the notes, but you don't have to use it.

844
01:44:22,830 --> 01:44:27,510
However, that does have the degradation rates and it does have the cards.

845
01:44:27,690 --> 01:44:35,999
If you guys want to refer to that, that's an easy way to get those parameters because it has them for ethanol.

846
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:41,890
It has them for coke. That's just a spreadsheet model.

847
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:54,380
Um, I don't know my question, but it's not a number one. Okay.

848
01:44:55,330 --> 01:45:03,980
So I don't know if anybody else has something. Okay.

849
01:45:05,070 --> 01:45:12,560
All right. I want you to.

850
01:45:13,230 --> 01:45:19,200
Well, starting with that's where you have to make the when roses.

851
01:45:19,230 --> 01:45:23,160
Mm hmm. It says to shoot two roses.

852
01:45:23,220 --> 01:45:29,130
Mm hmm. Are we doing one for both Detroit and Traverse City?

853
01:45:29,310 --> 01:45:35,910
I thought at that point you were just doing Detroit. Why is it an F?

854
01:45:37,260 --> 01:45:43,350
F? Yeah, it says mercy c application goes to show two roses for winter, spring and summer.

855
01:45:44,100 --> 01:45:47,880
The last sentence. Oh, I'm sorry. It should be three roses, I guess.

856
01:45:48,120 --> 01:45:51,510
Oh, excuse. Three roses total. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

857
01:45:52,590 --> 01:45:58,800
Sorry about that. That's great. Yeah, I hated that because one of them is really different from the others.

858
01:45:59,670 --> 01:46:04,500
Yeah. So, yes, I mean, I wasn't sure if I needed to English.

859
01:46:04,630 --> 01:46:10,290
No, no, that's fine. Oh, I have a question.

860
01:46:11,380 --> 01:46:24,120
And to see me talking about both in both cities is the question asking where would you place like a command center out of both cities?

861
01:46:24,600 --> 01:46:30,120
Sorry, that's a bad way to word it. Are you looking for one command center and pick the city you would best fit in?

862
01:46:31,790 --> 01:46:36,270
Oh. One command center city. One one per city.

863
01:46:36,310 --> 01:46:40,860
No, I mean, yeah. In, you know, these command centers are,

864
01:46:40,860 --> 01:46:49,980
as those explaining earlier during break are typically places where first responders would gather or coordinate their actions and so forth.

865
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:53,970
They don't want to be downwind of a plume. They want to be in the opposite direction.

866
01:47:12,840 --> 01:47:15,030
Any other questions? Yes.

867
01:47:15,480 --> 01:47:26,940
So with the early morning period, with some of the inversions in the early morning, when generally would you consider that to not be relevant?

868
01:47:26,940 --> 01:47:30,420
Was that cut out of like. Oh, depends, I assume.

869
01:47:30,990 --> 01:47:34,590
Yeah. Like I said, I mean, with air quality, everything is the answer is it depends.

870
01:47:35,010 --> 01:47:40,290
But typically by the time the sun is up, it's gone.

871
01:47:41,010 --> 01:47:44,190
So, I mean, up to, you know, to break up that inversion layer.

872
01:47:44,430 --> 01:47:53,360
So practically speaking, in the summertime, eight or 9:00, you're done in the winter could be ten or 10:00.

873
01:47:53,400 --> 01:47:59,010
That's so for like for this question, we can safely assume that's 10:00 in the morning that it would be past its past.

874
01:47:59,010 --> 01:48:06,300
Yeah, I think that's reasonable. Yeah, that's a really important driver here.

875
01:48:07,290 --> 01:48:16,210
And that's also the reason why the morning peak is more pronounced in the afternoon because in the afternoon, mixing layers elevated.

876
01:48:16,230 --> 01:48:20,580
There's no nocturnal version in effect, and so fluids are mixed much more effectively.

877
01:48:20,580 --> 01:48:31,190
So concentrations are a lot more. It's also the reason why you may, you know, in Ann Arbor or whatever,

878
01:48:31,190 --> 01:48:34,489
you may smell a lot of wood smoke when you get up in the morning and you open the door

879
01:48:34,490 --> 01:48:38,170
and it smells pretty smokier and even in the evening because there's just poor mixing.

880
01:48:39,300 --> 01:48:41,870
You don't smell too much in the afternoon. Yeah, sorry.

881
01:48:41,870 --> 01:48:56,419
I have a couple of questions, so please, anyone else know I from 4 to 3 now, but the three, I mean, we're looking at wild concentrations.

882
01:48:56,420 --> 01:49:03,050
So depending on which stock you're looking at and it says, look at the blue light.

883
01:49:03,470 --> 01:49:16,670
And so when I look at my right from my data from the spring review, I don't have anything that's greater than like ten that's at ten kilometers.

884
01:49:17,150 --> 01:49:22,660
But my my plume height goes from. See.

885
01:49:25,570 --> 01:49:30,120
Like 520 to 167.

886
01:49:30,630 --> 01:49:35,100
That's like my range. Well, this is 75. Okay, 167 meters.

887
01:49:35,100 --> 01:49:40,770
Two meters low. 29, 20 meters. Yeah. So that should affect the concentration, that change.

888
01:49:41,940 --> 01:49:49,190
Right. But I guess I'm confused because it sounds like the concentrations at short less than one kilometer or long.

889
01:49:51,520 --> 01:49:56,740
Yeah. So, you know, I just ignore those numbers. Yeah, pretty much, actually.

890
01:49:56,920 --> 01:50:02,950
That's all I mean. Yeah. I mean, what I do is I change the numbers, and sometimes the other numbers don't change.

891
01:50:03,220 --> 01:50:07,000
So you're. You're playing this to the screen?

892
01:50:07,120 --> 01:50:18,280
It's possible. Anything is possible. But the the idea here, though, is that obviously higher food will reduce local concentrations.

893
01:50:18,580 --> 01:50:22,310
Yeah. Right. Correct.

894
01:50:26,640 --> 01:50:34,000
This is actually a very complicated facility because they are at this Lafarge facility, four or five stacks, I believe.

895
01:50:35,590 --> 01:50:46,479
And modeling that is complicated. And one of the things that Lafarge didn't really do was to cluster the stacks high enough or close enough together.

896
01:50:46,480 --> 01:50:57,490
So they kind of is one stack. And if you took your plume model, right, and you say, okay, four times or five times the flow,

897
01:50:57,700 --> 01:51:03,220
that means I need a bigger stack and or the velocity is much higher.

898
01:51:03,910 --> 01:51:08,830
Those are wrong ways to approach the problem because it's very much influencing clean runs.

899
01:51:10,210 --> 01:51:16,480
Okay. Because it's a function of inertia in the thermal flux or and that's increased four or five times.

900
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:21,550
If you had the four or five sources together, each stack here operates more or less independently.

901
01:51:23,140 --> 01:51:32,920
Okay. So you need just to model a single stack and then multiply the result by four if you're going to do that to account for the four sources.

902
01:51:33,940 --> 01:51:37,389
And then just as a reminder in screen view, the stability.

903
01:51:37,390 --> 01:51:43,190
One is a two or three. Okay.

904
01:51:44,480 --> 01:51:47,840
Thank you, guys. I'll be here if you want to take off.

905
01:51:48,500 --> 01:51:52,640
I'll stay here to answer any other questions. Thank you.

906
01:51:53,060 --> 01:51:58,670
Thank you. Have a good break. Anybody going far away?

907
01:52:00,050 --> 01:52:04,580
You're not even thinking about that yet, Ari? No. Oh, yeah.

908
01:52:04,900 --> 01:52:10,280
Oh, good. Yeah.

909
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:17,920
Yeah. I feel like I should have just brought in, like, sugar pills or something.

910
01:52:19,090 --> 01:52:23,710
Maybe your aunt can refill caffeine. Yeah. Power drink?

911
01:52:24,330 --> 01:52:28,530
Yeah. Yeah.

912
01:52:28,540 --> 01:52:34,300
Three or four at home last night. Yeah, yeah.

913
01:52:37,420 --> 01:52:37,690
Yeah.
