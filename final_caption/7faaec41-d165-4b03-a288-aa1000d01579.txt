1
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:40,060
okay. afternoon everybody. so

2
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:45,160
Ron. well it's the new topic except the course we talked about studies and

3
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:50,220
interpreting studies all the way through so it's not really new

4
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:55,300
stuff this lecture in the next couple of lectures and probably a little bit after

5
00:00:55,300 --> 00:01:00,900
that. we're gonna focus on research methods specifically for occupational

6
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:05,923
environmental epidemiology so I'm trying to a balance here right for

7
00:01:05,923 --> 00:01:11,183
some people haven't even done in epidemiology cars and some people probably have done to maybe

8
00:01:11,183 --> 00:01:16,203
some you got for I don't know. and we have to turn

9
00:01:16,203 --> 00:01:21,323
to cover the background everyone's on the same page but I hope not to for people

10
00:01:21,323 --> 00:01:26,543
too much. give you a challenge if you already know if fair amount of epidemiology to go along

11
00:01:26,543 --> 00:01:31,783
but we still have to get through this. so I hope it will complement things

12
00:01:31,783 --> 00:01:37,363
you might got in general epidemiology and we're gonna focus on items

13
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:42,703
that are specific especially the occupational studies but also when you got

14
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:47,943
environmental contaminants of concern and that's pretty

15
00:01:47,943 --> 00:01:53,203
much it. so for example if we get there today we'll start

16
00:01:53,203 --> 00:01:58,603
lecture on healthy worker effect which course by definition

17
00:01:58,603 --> 00:02:03,867
is an issue occupational epidemiology studies and I think

18
00:02:03,867 --> 00:02:08,967
that I'm pretty sure almost everyone in this room will hear some new things they may not have heard

19
00:02:08,967 --> 00:02:14,767
before we go through that. okay.

20
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:20,947
so these are the different topics that we wanna talk about redoing it overview say

21
00:02:20,947 --> 00:02:26,187
you've already seen any even had to discuss examples of cohort studies included at them

22
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:31,647
right now it's the same standardized mortality ratios but we'll talk about those more.

23
00:02:31,647 --> 00:02:36,747
I will talk about case control studies in the context of occupational and environmental studies.

24
00:02:36,747 --> 00:02:41,987
talk to work fact. I I know I've mention for personal mortality

25
00:02:41,987 --> 00:02:47,067
ratio studies and not sure we'd actually looked at one we talked about cross sectional

26
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:52,067
studies how they sit in and towards the end time. hoping we'll

27
00:02:52,067 --> 00:02:57,787
talk about some data analysis strategies. alright so

28
00:02:57,787 --> 00:03:02,887
here I'm and gonna also discussed parts of what's on the most of these slides to try to get through it

29
00:03:02,887 --> 00:03:08,547
well trying to make it coherent for those of you to have an actually done at the course yet so basically

30
00:03:08,547 --> 00:03:13,687
when you doing epidemiologic study. you look the in human population and you're trying to see

31
00:03:13,687 --> 00:03:19,007
whether some exposure of interest is associated with some disease

32
00:03:19,007 --> 00:03:24,087
outcome of interest. alright. so that's that's what we're trying to do. hopefully maybe

33
00:03:24,087 --> 00:03:29,927
you can comment on conversation that we've talked about extensively and

34
00:03:29,927 --> 00:03:35,287
you could say. okay. everyone in the spot this is the population I'm interested

35
00:03:35,287 --> 00:03:40,487
in this this group of people. so I'm gonna study everything a person and every single minute of that

36
00:03:40,487 --> 00:03:45,907
person 's life and left whether or not the person had that exposure and every point in time

37
00:03:45,907 --> 00:03:52,367
and I'm also gonna follow them to their whole life and look at their disease status. and

38
00:03:52,367 --> 00:03:57,427
this this one's pretty obvious but believe me if you propose that you'll never get any

39
00:03:57,427 --> 00:04:02,707
funding from anybody because they'll say that sounds like an unbelievably

40
00:04:02,707 --> 00:04:08,203
consciously study can't you get the answers your question by doing something

41
00:04:08,203 --> 00:04:13,203
more limited than that. alright. and so it's Ashley what we're doing

42
00:04:13,203 --> 00:04:18,343
is you're you're sampling an experience

43
00:04:18,343 --> 00:04:23,523
a subset of the population. you look at their person time experience both with

44
00:04:23,523 --> 00:04:28,723
respect to when do they have exposures and what exposures and when

45
00:04:28,723 --> 00:04:33,903
did they have a disease outcomes you might be interested in. so basically study designs

46
00:04:33,903 --> 00:04:39,263
are big and out what's the best way. so give valid answers but also be sufficient

47
00:04:39,263 --> 00:04:44,523
to answer the questions you wanna answer about the association and associations which might

48
00:04:44,523 --> 00:04:49,943
hopefully because all if you've like to be able to comment on that.

49
00:04:49,943 --> 00:04:54,943
but to do this in a way where you're obviously not gonna collect every bit every scrap of information

50
00:04:54,943 --> 00:05:00,143
but make sure you end up with something that's representative of what what you would've found in the entire

51
00:05:00,143 --> 00:05:05,233
population. okay. so yep the judge

52
00:05:05,233 --> 00:05:11,853
before hand. what's gonna be the best kind of design and

53
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:16,913
so there's four key issues and choices studied science feasibility efficiency

54
00:05:16,913 --> 00:05:22,673
with the decision the feasibility says it can't be done. so

55
00:05:22,673 --> 00:05:27,753
we're always interested in some kind of exposure measures of the question are are there exposure measures that already

56
00:05:27,753 --> 00:05:34,213
exist that you could use or that you could reasonably collect in the future and

57
00:05:34,213 --> 00:05:39,493
how how can that be done and the same thing with the disease measures are there already exist and records

58
00:05:39,493 --> 00:05:45,013
about who has the disease and who doesn't and maybe how severe the diseases

59
00:05:45,013 --> 00:05:51,033
or are you able to follow people forward in time to see who develops disease. okay.

60
00:05:51,033 --> 00:05:56,313
that's part of feasibility. we're also interested in efficiency.

61
00:05:56,313 --> 00:06:01,413
I mean I gave you to begin the example of the most ridiculously inefficient like

62
00:06:01,413 --> 00:06:06,653
to collect every bit of information on everybody in the population you're interested in so if

63
00:06:06,653 --> 00:06:11,813
efficiency is asking the question so what do I get out each

64
00:06:11,813 --> 00:06:16,893
incremental increase in some kind of data. I'm gonna collect and you have to think about

65
00:06:16,893 --> 00:06:22,033
that in terms of each participant in the study how many people who gonna be included and what

66
00:06:22,033 --> 00:06:27,213
day your impact on each exposure measure you're gonna decide to to obtain

67
00:06:27,213 --> 00:06:32,773
and each disease measure you can decide to obtain and that sort of

68
00:06:32,773 --> 00:06:38,037
the time I get in bang for the buck because essentially what it comes down to is it worth the extra

69
00:06:38,037 --> 00:06:43,077
time effort and usually pops direct hot collecting this additional information or

70
00:06:43,077 --> 00:06:48,097
bringing these additional people to the study and collecting information

71
00:06:48,097 --> 00:06:53,557
in order to get an answer to my question how efficient is it with

72
00:06:53,557 --> 00:06:58,617
the cut off of what the reasonable efficiency and I don't need more than that and of

73
00:06:58,617 --> 00:07:03,677
course you want to get answers that are valid that are meaningful to actually reflect the state of nature

74
00:07:03,677 --> 00:07:08,977
what's out there which you're trying to study and so that you have to decide

75
00:07:08,977 --> 00:07:14,097
whether you have you want exposure matches that actually reflect the true exposure and exposure of

76
00:07:14,097 --> 00:07:19,097
interest what what exposure is actually gonna be of interest and I think you heard me stated

77
00:07:19,097 --> 00:07:25,617
before. not on this slide but I'm the majority of occupational and environmental

78
00:07:25,617 --> 00:07:30,897
studies. when they have a big problem and they don't come up with valid

79
00:07:30,897 --> 00:07:36,074
answers and they can't really answer the question that you wanted to answer nine times

80
00:07:36,074 --> 00:07:41,154
out of ten the biggest problem is with the exposure assessment that's and where like a lot of time.

81
00:07:41,154 --> 00:07:46,414
typically needs to go in. okay. and then the same question about do you disease measures

82
00:07:46,414 --> 00:07:51,634
actually reflect the true disease state that you're interested in and

83
00:07:51,634 --> 00:08:01,534
so that too obvious things. yeah

84
00:08:01,534 --> 00:08:06,914
I mean any and all the about which we'll get to in a minute. what whatever

85
00:08:06,914 --> 00:08:12,574
method or set of message are using to estimate peoples exposure can be

86
00:08:12,574 --> 00:08:17,654
you could be just one of those combination. we also gonna talk about you know what

87
00:08:17,654 --> 00:08:23,074
industrial hygienist do you know usually go out and actually do sampling and get quantitative results.

88
00:08:23,074 --> 00:08:28,814
we'll talk about all that. couple minutes. okay. alright so

89
00:08:28,814 --> 00:08:33,834
that's exposure measures disease badgers and then the question is how did you how did

90
00:08:33,834 --> 00:08:39,192
people get enrolled in the study where they select into the study and

91
00:08:39,192 --> 00:08:44,352
did you do that in a way that they're truly representative of the underlying

92
00:08:44,352 --> 00:08:49,352
population drew them from not just representative of the representatives of but

93
00:08:49,352 --> 00:08:54,352
in terms of the association or nine association between exposure

94
00:08:54,352 --> 00:09:02,152
and the disease. alright so that's the issues around selection and then

95
00:09:02,152 --> 00:09:07,432
right I well I sort covered to of those at the same time and then of course you have to worry about

96
00:09:07,432 --> 00:09:12,432
other factors and usually focused on the wrist that

97
00:09:12,432 --> 00:09:17,432
we've known for Missus factors for the disease or diseases you're interested in because

98
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:22,492
there's like some data saying there's a. previous data before

99
00:09:22,492 --> 00:09:27,532
you came to do the study thing. 's hey looks like having you

100
00:09:27,532 --> 00:09:33,072
know high … high cholesterol certain type

101
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:38,532
is a true independent risk factor for heart disease cardiovascular

102
00:09:38,532 --> 00:09:44,288
disease okay so if I said I'm going to do start

103
00:09:44,288 --> 00:09:49,288
looking at heart disease. garden variety cardiovascular

104
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:54,668
heart disease as my chief outcome I wanted to study and I

105
00:09:54,668 --> 00:09:59,668
and I didn't collect information about family history of heart disease

106
00:09:59,668 --> 00:10:04,928
about whether people have diabetes about whether people have hypertension about whether people have

107
00:10:04,928 --> 00:10:10,128
a tight listed and so on. I would be roundly

108
00:10:10,128 --> 00:10:15,288
criticized because everyone say well those are non- risk factors are big risk factors there important

109
00:10:15,288 --> 00:10:20,668
risk factors actually can drive whether or not some of the parts of these right

110
00:10:20,668 --> 00:10:25,688
and you didn't ask about them. so how do you know whatever association you

111
00:10:25,688 --> 00:10:30,748
did or did not fine with your exposure and heart disease isn't being fired by the fact he failed to

112
00:10:30,748 --> 00:10:35,788
find out whether those were associated also with exposure. so that's confounding

113
00:10:35,788 --> 00:10:41,048
right okay and then precision is talking about lack

114
00:10:41,048 --> 00:10:46,828
of random hair. so you have to worry about the size

115
00:10:46,828 --> 00:10:52,008
of the population that's gonna be in your study. how large it needs to be that's one where you try to reduce

116
00:10:52,008 --> 00:10:57,228
Randy there. but you also have to worry about how much variability

117
00:10:57,228 --> 00:11:02,288
is there in whatever your exposure measures are and whatever your disease measures are and is

118
00:11:02,288 --> 00:11:07,648
there something about how you organize the study or you're collecting that data allows greater

119
00:11:07,648 --> 00:11:13,588
variance in those factors than are necessary because when you have

120
00:11:13,588 --> 00:11:18,928
greater variability necessary. you're gonna reduce your precision even if it's not

121
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:24,788
buy it. if it just because you have a bigger standard deviation anyone.

122
00:11:24,788 --> 00:11:30,248
alright. so that's the background on that and now what

123
00:11:30,248 --> 00:11:35,588
other questions or comments on that that's like the quick overview of sort of what the epidemiology

124
00:11:35,588 --> 00:11:41,812
all about. we're trying to do that and what are all the things you have to worry about when you choose the study design

125
00:11:41,812 --> 00:11:47,732
but also when you course analyze the data and so on. I mean that was that was the

126
00:11:47,732 --> 00:11:53,412
whatever minutes that was five ten minute sort of overview to try to get everyone on the same page.

127
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:58,492
so it's possible bit about different kinds of studies now. who here that might get people up a little

128
00:11:58,492 --> 00:12:03,632
bit more attention is at the end of this lecture. I'm gonna

129
00:12:03,632 --> 00:12:08,652
quit you take a have take answers hopefully from people be

130
00:12:08,652 --> 00:12:13,972
willing to volunteer about comparing one type of study design

131
00:12:13,972 --> 00:12:19,012
to another. I mean be asking the question of is there any reason you would say that this

132
00:12:19,012 --> 00:12:24,172
type of study design is inherently tend to be inherently superior. you know it's like

133
00:12:24,172 --> 00:12:29,872
a hierarchy of study designs that you get better and for other things being equal just because the study designs

134
00:12:29,872 --> 00:12:34,992
you get better information out of it. so I'll be asking about that a little bit later in the selection.

135
00:12:34,992 --> 00:12:40,172
so cross sectional studies definition is that you are defined in

136
00:12:40,172 --> 00:12:45,472
your population and looking to see what people 's exposures are and with people 's disease

137
00:12:45,472 --> 00:12:50,952
status is all single point in time. right and

138
00:12:50,952 --> 00:12:55,972
so you can look at the problem is for example of disease gonna

139
00:12:55,972 --> 00:13:01,172
group with and without the exposure with higher exposure medium exposure

140
00:13:01,172 --> 00:13:06,332
and lower exposure and so on. so the biggest thing a limitation. I think

141
00:13:06,332 --> 00:13:11,792
your IRA knows this is that you don't know what order

142
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:17,002
things happened and you don't know whether the tax oh which actually preceded

143
00:13:17,002 --> 00:13:22,002
the disease because you collected all the state only at one point in time. you

144
00:13:22,002 --> 00:13:27,362
can just say that the person had both of it and of course we don't believe we're interested

145
00:13:27,362 --> 00:13:32,422
not to ten associations with possible associations shut to state of nature

146
00:13:32,422 --> 00:13:37,502
what's going on with the parking lot and of course if the exposure doesn't come before

147
00:13:37,502 --> 00:13:42,882
the disease can't be caught. okay. so

148
00:13:42,882 --> 00:13:48,702
but there's a lot of advantages to it right. it's usually low possible quick and I can

149
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:53,862
useful if you just trying to come up with some preliminary hypotheses and maybe you're gonna use a more refined study

150
00:13:53,862 --> 00:13:59,122
design time to really test and the other thing all day. it's

151
00:13:59,122 --> 00:14:04,122
an issue in all studies but this is huge issue. you know occupational studies to

152
00:14:04,122 --> 00:14:09,402
do only a simple cross sectional study because the problem.

153
00:14:09,402 --> 00:14:14,799
this is now I guess two other types of studies but it tends to be sort of

154
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:19,979
exacerbated in the sense in the work workplace issue is

155
00:14:19,979 --> 00:14:25,099
you show up one day and the people in your study are the people are working in the plant.

156
00:14:25,099 --> 00:14:30,339
you don't know who else came in work in the plastic and maybe left early because they became

157
00:14:30,339 --> 00:14:35,459
ill for example. maybe ill with the disease outcome you're interested. so you have

158
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:40,559
like that when you doing an occupational study besides just you know parking for the hearts

159
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:46,079
of exposure come before the disease it's also has there been

160
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:51,119
tremendous selection bias operating here that I can't even see I don't know anything about because

161
00:14:51,119 --> 00:14:56,139
I didn't collect any historical information over time. I just know who's in the plant this is

162
00:14:56,139 --> 00:15:01,399
one moment in time sir make intuitive sense to everybody that I can be a big problem.

163
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:07,459
okay. so

164
00:15:07,459 --> 00:15:13,033
cold hard. I think everyone sisters. the population

165
00:15:13,033 --> 00:15:18,813
free of the disease. when you initiate the study. when exposure began.

166
00:15:18,813 --> 00:15:23,853
are the potential for exposure begins and you're gonna follow forward in time to look at

167
00:15:23,853 --> 00:15:30,273
who developed the disease. al counter disease outcome of interest right.

168
00:15:30,273 --> 00:15:35,433
so you can you may have groups that are completely

169
00:15:35,433 --> 00:15:40,513
on exposing our exposed that you're comparing you may have groups with different levels of exposure to compare and

170
00:15:40,513 --> 00:15:46,293
so on but um and we'll talk in a moment about retrospective

171
00:15:46,293 --> 00:15:51,633
historical cohort studies versus true prospective cohort studies prospect of card

172
00:15:51,633 --> 00:15:56,633
that means essentially you if you're the investigator the person doing the study you.

173
00:15:56,633 --> 00:16:01,793
age with the cohort in real time. alright and but in general for

174
00:16:01,793 --> 00:16:06,913
cohort studies. they tend to be very expensive to do. even the one

175
00:16:06,913 --> 00:16:11,921
where all the information about exposure has ours been collected and maybe even

176
00:16:11,921 --> 00:16:17,641
all the disease outcomes regarding happen when you when you start the study cut

177
00:16:17,641 --> 00:16:22,921
figuring out from all the existing records. exactly what what what going on in interpreting that turns

178
00:16:22,921 --> 00:16:28,061
out to be actually quite inexpensive. typically quite inexpensive enterprise.

179
00:16:28,061 --> 00:16:33,601
they take a long time to do it usually meet a couple of years or longer

180
00:16:33,601 --> 00:16:38,941
and of course if you said I'm gonna follow people forward in time for a disease that takes many years develop

181
00:16:38,941 --> 00:16:45,541
after the exposure than they would take incredibly long and that probably wouldn't be a good design

182
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:50,721
and the other thing is you can typically only studying whatever exposures

183
00:16:50,721 --> 00:16:55,761
you decided to be where of interest and I have a series of exposures which is hard to come

184
00:16:55,761 --> 00:17:00,841
back later and say oh I should've thought about this exposure I didn't study it because it and collect information

185
00:17:00,841 --> 00:17:05,941
needed about it. alright. advantages

186
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:11,413
the time defense exposure preceding disease is made explicit for you

187
00:17:11,413 --> 00:17:17,033
and the reason is good reputation for reliability is we're gonna talk in a minute about

188
00:17:17,033 --> 00:17:22,033
well eerie it's case control studies as compared to color studies can have

189
00:17:22,033 --> 00:17:27,093
a lot of problems but a high quality case control

190
00:17:27,093 --> 00:17:32,413
study is actually equal in quality to similar high-quality cohort study

191
00:17:32,413 --> 00:17:37,613
but it's a little easier not to make some mistakes in the covert study that then you can make this case

192
00:17:37,613 --> 00:17:43,013
control. okay. so case control study. I think everyone knows this as well.

193
00:17:43,013 --> 00:17:48,113
so instead of starting with people are that exposed or not expose and fun forward in time. your

194
00:17:48,113 --> 00:17:53,133
people are to either have the disease of interest the golf cases have the disease control

195
00:17:53,133 --> 00:17:58,233
down. I guess to pick the right people

196
00:17:58,233 --> 00:18:03,273
to be the controls but then you can if you compare the cases and controls look back in time to

197
00:18:03,273 --> 00:18:10,495
see whether they differed and exposures of interest right. so

198
00:18:10,495 --> 00:18:15,515
limitations one limitation here is sort of the flipside of what we just said about cohort studies

199
00:18:15,515 --> 00:18:20,655
one limitation is that I mean you could identify several diseases but basically

200
00:18:20,655 --> 00:18:25,915
you're choosing your tape is in your control based on the having maybe a primary disease

201
00:18:25,915 --> 00:18:31,395
or not having it and so you can't come back and say I wanted to study ten other diseases

202
00:18:31,395 --> 00:18:36,435
and these two populations because that's not how you select people under the study. if the defined

203
00:18:36,435 --> 00:18:41,895
with disease you're focused on it maybe difficult

204
00:18:41,895 --> 00:18:47,075
to find comparable cases and controls and they have there's all

205
00:18:47,075 --> 00:18:52,495
kinds of examples of that and it may be difficult to get comparable information about cases control

206
00:18:52,495 --> 00:18:57,635
so they show about this about the five comparable cases and controls

207
00:18:57,635 --> 00:19:02,855
um tell me what's wrong with this study the side of a case control study

208
00:19:02,855 --> 00:19:08,733
I want to figure out whether or not um

209
00:19:08,733 --> 00:19:14,333
smoking a lot of cigarettes over your lifetime is a risk factor for lung cancer

210
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:19,353
and I just I don't gonna come. I'm gonna my case is gonna be the people who love hamsters and I

211
00:19:19,353 --> 00:19:25,353
controls are gonna be the next person who's admitted to the same hospitals but didn't have lung cancer.

212
00:19:25,353 --> 00:19:30,493
that's it. that's all I'm saying about who the controls are because of that now

213
00:19:30,493 --> 00:19:35,513
this is based on your background knowledge. you're knowing what cigarettes can do as a birthday problem with

214
00:19:35,513 --> 00:19:40,753
that is not any reason you say stop right there you're gonna get the wrong answer.

215
00:19:40,753 --> 00:19:53,893
anyway willing to speak to that. you know I mean you wanna say something about why that's a problem

216
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:58,893
okay right similar conditions pre-existing but there's something really I was

217
00:19:58,893 --> 00:20:04,133
hoping you say something much more specifics about those conditions. um you think they people

218
00:20:04,133 --> 00:20:10,873
lined up and yes go ahead

219
00:20:10,873 --> 00:20:16,033
no you can't do that. the whole point is to see who smokers and who are who is not

220
00:20:16,033 --> 00:20:21,133
defined. you've entered people a study based on whether or not they have lung cancer. now you're gonna go back

221
00:20:21,133 --> 00:20:26,913
and what you're going to compare it to see who has the exposure and you done. okay

222
00:20:26,913 --> 00:20:36,633
yeah.

223
00:20:36,633 --> 00:20:41,813
okay. I agree with that that is often a big issue that's been difficult

224
00:20:41,813 --> 00:20:46,893
to get comparable information for case of Charles. but I was much trying

225
00:20:46,893 --> 00:20:53,411
to a have slightly different question go ahead

226
00:20:53,411 --> 00:21:06,571
just getting like

227
00:21:06,571 --> 00:21:11,630
these are okay

228
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:19,250
you get that what I'm trying to get at your your clothes you're hot on drugs

229
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:27,211
schools.

230
00:21:27,211 --> 00:21:32,250
you see have work because then you've just determine both whether the person 's or whether they have

231
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:41,691
the disease and whether they have exposure. so you know you don't really have anything left to come.

232
00:21:41,691 --> 00:21:46,730
yeah.

233
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:51,791
well if you're gonna you know do a really good job of documenting my disease I mean that's could be

234
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:56,830
true but you're gonna do a really good job of documenting which is using. okay I got more. so there's more

235
00:21:56,830 --> 00:22:01,970
basic problem. anybody. I mean you you. okay. so

236
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:07,230
here's the basic problem. I said I'm gonna take every individual has lung cancer

237
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:12,391
kinda take the next person that shows up the hospital with it different diagnosis.

238
00:22:12,391 --> 00:22:17,930
this is in the diagnosis is right the off bone cancer.

239
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:23,651
I down speaking of myself I say you're gonna badly underestimate

240
00:22:23,651 --> 00:22:29,271
the strength of the association between lung cancer and cigarette smoking

241
00:22:29,271 --> 00:22:34,450
has been smoking pot a lot of other diseases that the people in the hospital

242
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:39,570
by primary vascular disease an awful lot of people which is very um

243
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:44,651
whole lot about those next people are gonna have cardiovascular disease and because they have

244
00:22:44,651 --> 00:22:50,250
cardiovascular disease and been very much for lack eight of the cigarette smokers because it's such a big risk factor.

245
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:55,806
so you've been out by not excluding other disease

246
00:22:55,806 --> 00:23:01,206
entities known already known to be so David with your exposure of interest. you have guaranteed

247
00:23:01,206 --> 00:23:06,226
a buyer and in a particular direction. biased towards the knob towards no

248
00:23:06,226 --> 00:23:11,326
association. so that that's like a big mistake. you don't wanna do

249
00:23:11,326 --> 00:23:16,346
that that makes sense to everyone else that you hear me because I think get

250
00:23:16,346 --> 00:23:24,526
I wanna quite say exactly that you got the closest yeah

251
00:23:24,526 --> 00:23:29,966
your ideal control would probably be for paid that year. you have to think about the diseases

252
00:23:29,966 --> 00:23:35,186
that are creeping enough that you can you know you have a decent set of controls

253
00:23:35,186 --> 00:23:40,466
look at. I mean well I'm set I'm doing ideal control at the hospital based

254
00:23:40,466 --> 00:23:45,506
Audi eight. we could we could make it broader but you can do a good study this hospital but

255
00:23:45,506 --> 00:23:51,274
yes as they get diseases that you're quite confident. I'm not

256
00:23:51,274 --> 00:23:57,394
associated with whether or not your cigarette snobs or so for example

257
00:23:57,394 --> 00:24:02,694
you might say serious fractures serious enough

258
00:24:02,694 --> 00:24:07,875
to land you in the hospital you know so like other people got orthopedic service might

259
00:24:07,875 --> 00:24:12,954
be a good comparison group would be an example because

260
00:24:12,954 --> 00:24:18,214
I mean you can you can make up some scenarios where there'd be some association one way or another

261
00:24:18,214 --> 00:24:23,974
but in a more general way it's a well probably smoking cigarettes is not a huge predictor

262
00:24:23,974 --> 00:24:29,454
whether someone's gonna fracture there to be in the next week. okay

263
00:24:29,454 --> 00:24:35,294
that makes sense. now it's I could come back and say

264
00:24:35,294 --> 00:24:40,995
yeah. but I figure smoking somewhat associate with osteoporosis

265
00:24:40,995 --> 00:24:46,914
with loss of bone mass and if you're including especially older women where they have more of an issue.

266
00:24:46,914 --> 00:24:52,054
you might be very strong association and actually gonna you're underestimate it again. you have the think these things

267
00:24:52,054 --> 00:24:57,144
through but you know if you're if you're doing a hospital based study

268
00:24:57,144 --> 00:25:02,224
controls from the hospital and you're taking all powers we don't have

269
00:25:02,224 --> 00:25:07,564
your diagnosis and you've got you've got an exposure to positive model

270
00:25:07,564 --> 00:25:12,604
different diseases put some of the hospital. you're you're gonna come up with a mess. you'll you won't

271
00:25:12,604 --> 00:25:18,124
be able to you won't come up with an accurate estimate of what the associations. okay.

272
00:25:18,124 --> 00:25:23,184
and it will be biased towards an all in that situation you'll underestimate how strong respect

273
00:25:23,184 --> 00:25:28,344
cigarettes are from lung cancer. okay. I mean I'm not trying to do the math

274
00:25:28,344 --> 00:25:33,364
but that's that's extension everybody. okay. okay.

275
00:25:33,364 --> 00:25:38,384
alright so so that's the difficulty of

276
00:25:38,384 --> 00:25:44,084
finding comparable cases and controls now. sometimes people try to do

277
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:49,604
a different way of population that doesn't depend on people being admitted to hospitals

278
00:25:49,604 --> 00:25:55,536
but then the problem here is you got a lot of other issues or how did people get identified

279
00:25:55,536 --> 00:26:00,976
and what's their age distribution there could be a lot of other issues to think about it has the advantages

280
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:06,476
tends to possible and then doing a call heart study

281
00:26:06,476 --> 00:26:11,536
and that she actually true is if the disease is rare and the exposure

282
00:26:11,536 --> 00:26:16,596
is reasonably common. so let's stop and think for a second about why that statement should

283
00:26:16,596 --> 00:26:21,697
be true. so let's pick a really rare disease. suppose you soon

284
00:26:21,697 --> 00:26:27,457
maybe when we don't know much about you wanna figure out what are the

285
00:26:27,457 --> 00:26:32,515
risk factors for him I don't know. I'm not

286
00:26:32,515 --> 00:26:37,715
sure not constantly rare well it's soft tissue sarcoma. r Thomas

287
00:26:37,715 --> 00:26:42,734
lot less common type of cancer than Carson. so

288
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:48,175
you know I certain type of lung cancer for example it might be like

289
00:26:48,175 --> 00:26:54,035
you know one in a thousand people die for that type of bone cancer so it's quite rare

290
00:26:54,035 --> 00:27:00,275
and you might have a series that was your radiation

291
00:27:00,275 --> 00:27:05,335
put you at increased risk of lung cancer which course it actually does in real life you if

292
00:27:05,335 --> 00:27:10,854
said the right exposure and off of it and use a gun gonna do a

293
00:27:10,854 --> 00:27:16,775
call hard study of general population I'm gonna estimate

294
00:27:16,775 --> 00:27:21,854
from their work how much exposure they have the ionizing radiation and then I'll

295
00:27:21,854 --> 00:27:27,095
look to see if the people with more exposure ionizing radiation are more likely

296
00:27:27,095 --> 00:27:32,098
to have those sarcoma the people with low exposure well. so

297
00:27:32,098 --> 00:27:37,678
that's a very rare disease I said like maybe one of thousand or something. so

298
00:27:37,678 --> 00:27:42,758
anyone does for your problem with how expensive it's gonna be to do a study. it's big

299
00:27:42,758 --> 00:27:47,958
enough as a cohort study to happen enough individuals in the study actually

300
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:53,238
develop sarcoma. so that you can do a valid comparison that you have you

301
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:58,398
you you got a large enough sample size to have enough cases show

302
00:27:58,398 --> 00:28:03,938
up in your sale and your cohorts that you have

303
00:28:03,938 --> 00:28:08,958
narrow enough confidence intervals around your estimate association to say from you about whether

304
00:28:08,958 --> 00:28:13,998
it's a real association. so you might if you if you just plan to do

305
00:28:13,998 --> 00:28:19,278
a study like that you might have to put. I mean literally you might have to put

306
00:28:19,278 --> 00:28:24,278
five hundred thousand people in your study in order to get enough to start home as it's just

307
00:28:24,278 --> 00:28:30,134
to look at and actually test things and be able to come to conclusion. so gonna say wait a minute

308
00:28:30,134 --> 00:28:35,494
why aren't you calling to see fear registry

309
00:28:35,494 --> 00:28:40,734
which which is you know our cancer registry that a lot of metropolitan areas agreeing

310
00:28:40,734 --> 00:28:45,954
to try to pass I think that that he yeah. so comes

311
00:28:45,954 --> 00:28:51,214
like why aren't you doing that or read. hey why don't you. if if that's

312
00:28:51,214 --> 00:28:56,574
it's hard to been done for you but you here if there's a C registry but why you going through hospital records.

313
00:28:56,574 --> 00:29:01,694
look for who had who had sarcoma 's and then do a case control study because

314
00:29:01,694 --> 00:29:06,914
you don't need so many fewer people in your study to come to a conclusion about whether any exposure

315
00:29:06,914 --> 00:29:12,214
that much more common than the sarcoma. this so. I'm not

316
00:29:12,214 --> 00:29:17,374
showing in numbers but I'm I making sense to you if you got you have a rare outcome. you

317
00:29:17,374 --> 00:29:22,434
don't want to just take everybody you had an exposure that you're interested in being associated that

318
00:29:22,434 --> 00:29:28,638
outcomes you gonna have to wait so long so you know people that have all come to come to a conclusion

319
00:29:28,638 --> 00:29:33,658
that you're gonna probably do a case study so I got here here's a really difficult question with

320
00:29:33,658 --> 00:29:39,038
a simple answer that dad. okay it's okay for call study it's probably better if the disease

321
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:45,298
is very rare and exposures at least reasonably common. what if

322
00:29:45,298 --> 00:29:50,638
one of the diseases and

323
00:29:50,638 --> 00:29:56,058
what one of the disease is rare and the

324
00:29:56,058 --> 00:30:01,138
exposures also rare and I have it. what you can do for W

325
00:30:01,138 --> 00:30:06,558
event.

326
00:30:06,558 --> 00:30:11,638
okay. I was sort of a trick question to answer that question is you can't

327
00:30:11,638 --> 00:30:16,958
study it without spending billions of dollars.

328
00:30:16,958 --> 00:30:22,018
if both the exposure and the disease are covered too. rare bye. sorry I you

329
00:30:22,018 --> 00:30:27,258
don't really have a good way to get at least that way that any reasonable funding

330
00:30:27,258 --> 00:30:32,266
agencies gonna about this is gonna be so expensive to get an answer and then people are gonna say well why do

331
00:30:32,266 --> 00:30:37,946
you bother yourself you people have exposure and so few people have the disease

332
00:30:37,946 --> 00:30:43,026
like maybe you know comes up one time it's ten million when you bother to do the study.

333
00:30:43,026 --> 00:30:54,266
so don't they rare disease and rare exposure. both of the same time. yeah

334
00:30:54,266 --> 00:31:03,566
right well

335
00:31:03,566 --> 00:31:10,106
well I think I think it's good example if her members on the next. bye. yeah.

336
00:31:10,106 --> 00:31:15,486
talk about the next five because I think that was her name too much. so

337
00:31:15,486 --> 00:31:20,506
I really expected strategy as that often is quite cost effective.

338
00:31:20,506 --> 00:31:25,666
if you have a mix design. what people typically call and that's the case control studies so this means

339
00:31:25,666 --> 00:31:31,426
you started with the cohort studies you followed a large part over a period of time

340
00:31:31,426 --> 00:31:37,245
and then you have you see that there's a lot of people developing some disease entity

341
00:31:37,245 --> 00:31:42,485
and you want to test whether that disease

342
00:31:42,485 --> 00:31:48,206
and he is being caused by some exposure that you're suspicious is college it maybe

343
00:31:48,206 --> 00:31:53,266
potentially several different instructions you're suspicious. so what you could

344
00:31:53,266 --> 00:31:58,345
do in that case if you're ready have a large part of our to collect all the information on. you can say

345
00:31:58,345 --> 00:32:03,406
well I actually need some really much more detailed information about the exposure which is

346
00:32:03,406 --> 00:32:08,786
gonna be expensive but I'm not gonna do that every single person that didn't have didn't

347
00:32:08,786 --> 00:32:13,926
have the disease. instead of doing on their

348
00:32:13,926 --> 00:32:19,146
phone and putting all the people that had the disease and

349
00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:25,586
comparison to people in the color hardly didn't have the disease. somehow randomly selected

350
00:32:25,586 --> 00:32:30,608
by maybe like an evil numbers of the people have a disease or maybe

351
00:32:30,608 --> 00:32:35,968
twice the manager most maybe four times as many times it turns out you have diminishing returns

352
00:32:35,968 --> 00:32:40,968
you if have too many people and so you got the expense.

353
00:32:40,968 --> 00:32:46,668
doing a very detailed exposure of the exposure assessment.

354
00:32:46,668 --> 00:32:51,988
but you don't do that for the entire cohort. you only do that for this sub

355
00:32:51,988 --> 00:32:57,048
sample you pick to be the controls with with the cases. so

356
00:32:57,048 --> 00:33:02,408
that's an example where you have all the advantages that they came out of a call heart study.

357
00:33:02,408 --> 00:33:07,608
so you know a lot about them you know what came first and so on you can actually estimate after the

358
00:33:07,608 --> 00:33:13,442
rest because it's in a colored study will talk about that moment but

359
00:33:13,442 --> 00:33:18,682
you have all those advantages but you don't try to collect really expensive detailed information

360
00:33:18,682 --> 00:33:23,722
on everybody is you don't really need to you'll have almost as much optical

361
00:33:23,722 --> 00:33:28,902
power and answer the question. if you say I was just gonna do a nested case control study inside

362
00:33:28,902 --> 00:33:34,742
the toll hearts. I'll have all the people of the disease I'm worried about now. but just small.

363
00:33:34,742 --> 00:33:40,122
I mean comparable size the number of cases but in terms of who's in the cold hard to didn't have the disease

364
00:33:40,122 --> 00:33:45,161
only a small group of people will I need to spend all the money to really refine my

365
00:33:45,161 --> 00:33:50,161
exposure assessment. so it's like I don't know that sort of thing answer what you're trying to ask

366
00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:56,002
about. believe I that they've like an ideal situation and say well I sort of know

367
00:33:56,002 --> 00:34:01,382
exactly how comparable the data is in the cohort case control study and they're they're

368
00:34:01,382 --> 00:34:06,902
saying you know that done with the same care.

369
00:34:06,902 --> 00:34:12,141
alright already see him and can get the stuff straight

370
00:34:12,141 --> 00:34:17,601
see yeah. so that's

371
00:34:17,601 --> 00:34:23,361
what I was trying to explain is what the last bullet on this. it says that

372
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:29,121
you can collect this expensive to collect detailed exposure information on just a sub sample

373
00:34:29,121 --> 00:34:34,301
and have almost as much statistical powers that you included the entire covert and today that.

374
00:34:34,301 --> 00:34:39,841
so it's much more efficient. once you've identified a disease you're concerned about.

375
00:34:39,841 --> 00:34:45,220
I'm not gonna buy way I wouldn't put some complicated question about nested case control study

376
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:50,401
on the final exam. I don't think that would be quite fair but

377
00:34:50,401 --> 00:34:55,521
I thought it was you know about business or savings and answer.

378
00:34:55,521 --> 00:35:00,781
okay. so more things on feasibility

379
00:35:00,781 --> 00:35:05,895
efficiency and still one big question is what kind of disease outcomes look

380
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:10,935
for in the in the big divider is and I gotta look at mortality what people died from. I'm I

381
00:35:10,935 --> 00:35:16,135
gonna look at morbidity people they're alive but I've been diagnosed around diagnosing with

382
00:35:16,135 --> 00:35:21,275
this disease. so that's sort of comparing pluses

383
00:35:21,275 --> 00:35:26,375
and minuses of doing my county versus morbidity and we've look at. I think

384
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:31,435
both kinds of studies I more mortality. so mortality information is

385
00:35:31,435 --> 00:35:36,675
widely available. it's if if it's a disease it's frequently

386
00:35:36,675 --> 00:35:41,875
stayed all makes sense to do it. um obviously

387
00:35:41,875 --> 00:35:47,235
if it's a disease it's very rarely or never fatal. you should not be doing mortality right

388
00:35:47,235 --> 00:35:52,415
this is not gonna have any case. okay. you all know all about death

389
00:35:52,415 --> 00:35:57,815
certificate from having do stuff we talked about having done homework. you know

390
00:35:57,815 --> 00:36:02,934
the prior information you very but you can usually find them and they're classified

391
00:36:02,934 --> 00:36:08,574
certain ways and you can think about this classification and all this kind of thing and so on and

392
00:36:08,574 --> 00:36:13,615
how the night. nice from the point of view of being an investigator. nice for the first

393
00:36:13,615 --> 00:36:18,694
experience if another nice thing about death is it occurs

394
00:36:18,694 --> 00:36:24,135
only once and usually have a reliable day. it occurred on

395
00:36:24,135 --> 00:36:29,214
for any given individual right. compare that to morbidity studies which is what I

396
00:36:29,214 --> 00:36:35,594
usually do. so you a more limited data. I can be systematic

397
00:36:35,594 --> 00:36:40,635
but we you can cover almost any kind of medical condition. you can look for

398
00:36:40,635 --> 00:36:45,654
morbidity and there's a lot of different possible data sources that you had to

399
00:36:45,654 --> 00:36:52,414
think carefully about their policy. so if I don't read because you see that

400
00:36:52,414 --> 00:36:57,914
and where on death certificate. is is very standardized ways of applying

401
00:36:57,914 --> 00:37:03,116
these international classification of disease. I CD codes the death certificate

402
00:37:03,116 --> 00:37:08,197
and have the sociologist person 's trying to do that. you don't have a comparable thing

403
00:37:08,197 --> 00:37:13,197
really with type cd codes for morbidity and then

404
00:37:13,197 --> 00:37:18,197
another problem is I suppose you're doing a study. me because I mean it would be

405
00:37:18,197 --> 00:37:23,477
a really good example of it. I'm sure some of us have experience with us you know I do.

406
00:37:23,477 --> 00:37:29,037
suppose you want do a study on exposures that are associated with developing

407
00:37:29,037 --> 00:37:34,796
this a very low back pain. bad enough that you can't go to work. okay.

408
00:37:34,796 --> 00:37:40,796
so stop and think about your disease out and you realize you got a lot of headaches

409
00:37:40,796 --> 00:37:45,917
it's not back ache headache there in terms of defining it because what happens

410
00:37:45,917 --> 00:37:51,017
the most people is they get something they get bad low back pain

411
00:37:51,017 --> 00:37:56,616
maybe enough to keep them out of work especially if your work involves hard labor ads

412
00:37:56,616 --> 00:38:02,197
and then they get better and they go back to work and then they have another asset so maybe

413
00:38:02,197 --> 00:38:07,317
two months later maybe it's a year later maybe five years later is that a new disease or

414
00:38:07,317 --> 00:38:13,297
is that just the same disease again that question doesn't come up with a death certificate.

415
00:38:13,297 --> 00:38:20,237
you know it's a new debt. so there's reasons it's easier to define things

416
00:38:20,237 --> 00:38:25,397
other things to think about her talk about whether the house town is common or rare. if the comes rare.

417
00:38:25,397 --> 00:38:30,537
you probably wanna do a case control study not a covert study. but

418
00:38:30,537 --> 00:38:35,717
as it says that the very bottom. unless you're doing a prospective cohort study

419
00:38:35,717 --> 00:38:40,837
which is very expensive that's big issue meeting you agent I'm an investigator with

420
00:38:40,837 --> 00:38:46,097
the people in the study. unless you're doing that. usually the question is what records already

421
00:38:46,097 --> 00:38:51,437
exist. you're certainly interested in records if you do a case control study because exposure. you're interested

422
00:38:51,437 --> 00:38:57,312
in already happened and if you're doing a retrospective cohort study

423
00:38:57,312 --> 00:39:02,393
you you again I gonna wanna look at what records exist to see whether you can actually estimate with people

424
00:39:02,393 --> 00:39:07,552
's exposures where in the past accurately. so that's a big driver and that

425
00:39:07,552 --> 00:39:13,013
like when you when typically happens and I want to do an occupational

426
00:39:13,013 --> 00:39:18,032
study they spent a lot of time looking for that's the right facility.

427
00:39:18,032 --> 00:39:23,153
the right employer to do the study at the time. they need to find a place where

428
00:39:23,153 --> 00:39:28,513
there were certain first of all very good records of who where when that's

429
00:39:28,513 --> 00:39:33,513
not always that hard because it's often tied the payroll issue is that there's usually good records out

430
00:39:33,513 --> 00:39:38,753
but also to where their actual exposure measures taken and

431
00:39:38,753 --> 00:39:43,773
we know why people took the exposure measures when they talk them to which can be very important question

432
00:39:43,773 --> 00:39:49,233
as well. that kind of thing so you actually look around a long time to find the right the right facility

433
00:39:49,233 --> 00:39:54,737
to do it in facility that has enough historical information that you think is valid.

434
00:39:54,737 --> 00:40:00,237
if you can answer the question. okay.

435
00:40:00,237 --> 00:40:05,297
alright. so here anyone

436
00:40:05,297 --> 00:40:10,757
can chime in here. those of you that are doing industrial hygiene occupational

437
00:40:10,757 --> 00:40:16,156
hygiene you pay. you may have left comments and some of these things. but

438
00:40:16,156 --> 00:40:21,277
you have you brought up yet to come up with some way to characterize exposure.

439
00:40:21,277 --> 00:40:26,537
so one nice thing is if you have actually exposure records like measurements of what concentrations

440
00:40:26,537 --> 00:40:32,197
were in the air if you're in an occupational study and

441
00:40:32,197 --> 00:40:39,277
there's a lot of good things about that. usually the employer maintains the record so you can find them.

442
00:40:39,277 --> 00:40:44,317
you have quantified exposure that you know I was recorded before the disease outcome occurred

443
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:49,346
so at least one kind of fire you. you're not gonna see you often will have a

444
00:40:49,346 --> 00:40:54,526
personal sample. so you actually have you know where the air that's being sucked say across

445
00:40:54,526 --> 00:40:59,666
the filter for example if you know you got something now that on the person 's help

446
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:04,786
those near their nose and mouth is supposed to represent what they're actually breathing. so

447
00:41:04,786 --> 00:41:10,206
you may be able to come up with really for an individual that actually where one of those very accurate

448
00:41:10,206 --> 00:41:15,466
estimate of what the exposure was and you can you have area samples which

449
00:41:15,466 --> 00:41:21,066
you maybe built to apply to multiple individuals. so those those are all good things.

450
00:41:21,066 --> 00:41:26,506
weaknesses are usually you can't get all these records unless the employer wants to comply

451
00:41:26,506 --> 00:41:31,646
and let you do this study and another big issue that comes

452
00:41:31,646 --> 00:41:36,826
up very often with trying to do need to. I just mentioned in a moment ago. if the problem

453
00:41:36,826 --> 00:41:42,666
that when you look at historical records. air monitoring

454
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:48,681
that we collected. you'll see number people measure things

455
00:41:48,681 --> 00:41:53,721
but then the question is why did they measure that on say a personal sample

456
00:41:53,721 --> 00:41:58,941
on this person on that day. this is because the their

457
00:41:58,941 --> 00:42:04,201
industrial hygienist for the company that was doing with that person probably really should be doing with their med

458
00:42:04,201 --> 00:42:09,822
do which is to identify and control potentially adverse exposures

459
00:42:09,822 --> 00:42:14,881
and and that person mock transit based on my experience and for

460
00:42:14,881 --> 00:42:19,921
these reasons I think if anyone's getting over exposed to the station and the entire. if

461
00:42:19,921 --> 00:42:25,062
the people in this department doing that job. so that's I'm gonna measure the people don't always write

462
00:42:25,062 --> 00:42:30,121
down why they did it and if that's if that's the only people that get it measured

463
00:42:30,121 --> 00:42:35,621
and you think that's a representative sample. what if you done with your exposure estimate. you can drastically

464
00:42:35,621 --> 00:42:40,781
overestimated with average the exposures were in the plant because you don't understand because you don't understand

465
00:42:40,781 --> 00:42:46,581
the reason the reason the person collect samples

466
00:42:46,581 --> 00:42:51,760
that sense like you say cannot my name

467
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:57,220
different than the records and what exposures works but in fact

468
00:42:57,220 --> 00:43:03,000
giving time. exactly where an explosion going to be in on the major in there

469
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:08,000
and the side flip of that which unfortunately

470
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:13,060
I think this might be on the next yeah. to demonstrate legal compliance I already told you I

471
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:18,240
told my story about the call coworkers with the white spots

472
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:23,600
on it. I did tell you that right yeah. okay. please someone remember.

473
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:29,180
so yeah unfortunately it shouldn't be any different with compliance

474
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:34,980
but in fact if you wanna prove that you're not exceeding standards. sometimes

475
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:40,780
you know management putting pressure maybe on some someone is trying to do the right thing but the same

476
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:45,840
I don't want to do a high measurements come back so the person I do the opposite of what I just described and like

477
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:50,969
purposely go to the areas where they're sure they're gonna get a low recall and again if you don't know

478
00:43:50,969 --> 00:43:57,229
that now you're gonna drastically underestimates exposures. okay.

479
00:43:57,229 --> 00:44:02,750
nobody cares I can tell.

480
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:08,669
okay. okay. alright. and

481
00:44:08,669 --> 00:44:15,490
biological exposure measures. there's a lot of straight

482
00:44:15,490 --> 00:44:21,929
block the phone and wake people up. okay..

483
00:44:21,929 --> 00:44:27,290
so what's nice about it is that even compared to

484
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:32,689
personal air sampling actually manages an internal doubt. I mean it's closer to what you really interested

485
00:44:32,689 --> 00:44:37,870
in. you wanna understand. I mean really what you wanna know it's what does

486
00:44:37,870 --> 00:44:43,110
what internal exposure was the Oregon Oregon system could

487
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:48,118
be damaged the disease with the current. what was that Oregon system actually seen

488
00:44:48,118 --> 00:44:53,138
so this gets a lot closer than just measuring what's in the air and it is said there you

489
00:44:53,138 --> 00:44:58,338
know it that's text addresses all out. maybe you're in a situation

490
00:44:58,338 --> 00:45:04,398
where air exposure is important but direct direct

491
00:45:04,398 --> 00:45:09,738
penetration through the skin is actually very important as well. and when you measure internal

492
00:45:09,738 --> 00:45:14,738
dollars she'll capture both of those weird you'll completely miss what's going on. if again you only redo their sampling

493
00:45:14,738 --> 00:45:19,738
right and I hate may it

494
00:45:19,738 --> 00:45:25,138
may pick up on things that you know two people are supposed to doing the same job

495
00:45:25,138 --> 00:45:30,658
same job title have same the responsibilities. they may do the job very differently

496
00:45:30,658 --> 00:45:35,818
or they may or they may do they may differ with respect to the smoke cigarettes on the job

497
00:45:35,818 --> 00:45:41,038
and the cigarettes get contaminated with the agent where do they wash their hands before

498
00:45:41,038 --> 00:45:46,118
they eat and so a lot of things like that you wouldn't

499
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:52,274
necessarily catch up with air sampling you made that will be integrated as well.

500
00:45:52,274 --> 00:45:57,454
topic kinetics of you know maybe varied from individual to individual

501
00:45:57,454 --> 00:46:02,734
and so on and and you may even wanna know. okay but what's the person background

502
00:46:02,734 --> 00:46:09,114
exposure this it's not from work. even that's gonna be in the grade. so how sounds fantastic.

503
00:46:09,114 --> 00:46:14,234
the flipside of what it says the weight message is often the results you

504
00:46:14,234 --> 00:46:19,234
get our fix. it's very difficult to interpret what they mean. if you

505
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:24,354
don't actually understand the whole absorption

506
00:46:24,354 --> 00:46:29,596
whether things are getting vile transform how to get into maybe dated two different body compartments

507
00:46:29,596 --> 00:46:34,716
how the games created. so what would be

508
00:46:34,716 --> 00:46:40,736
a good example good example would be

509
00:46:40,736 --> 00:46:45,996
maybe there's two different metabolic routes by which agent the first

510
00:46:45,996 --> 00:46:51,356
people are been exposed to you can go to maybe one of them involved if I mean up

511
00:46:51,356 --> 00:46:56,736
side you know like triangle with oxygen and if that tends to be very reactive

512
00:46:56,736 --> 00:47:01,776
and the other one and so that's actually the toxic metabolize and the other

513
00:47:01,776 --> 00:47:07,916
one other mechanism actually

514
00:47:07,916 --> 00:47:14,096
create something that's been. so if you just go and measure

515
00:47:14,096 --> 00:47:19,276
um what is in the person 's body of the original agent. you didn't

516
00:47:19,276 --> 00:47:24,496
actually find out what was the exposure level of the agent

517
00:47:24,496 --> 00:47:29,657
of two inches which is really the approximate form metabolize you so you have to know

518
00:47:29,657 --> 00:47:34,697
a lot about what's going on you know that that's what you're looking for that's part of it it

519
00:47:34,697 --> 00:47:40,157
should often often biological measures can be difficult to interpret

520
00:47:40,157 --> 00:47:45,897
if you don't have it there is insufficient scientific information. so probably

521
00:47:45,897 --> 00:47:50,937
um if you wanna go standard is except it's not valid

522
00:47:50,937 --> 00:47:55,937
sled dogs of biological measures of lead. we

523
00:47:55,937 --> 00:48:00,977
we understand really well how they interpret and what they need like blood lab and bomb

524
00:48:00,977 --> 00:48:06,197
labs and all that. that's because we understand what

525
00:48:06,197 --> 00:48:11,317
routes of absorption and redistribution the body we know what how it ends up in the bottom

526
00:48:11,317 --> 00:48:16,557
you know refill rates the with blood we know that the flood usually represents six of the current

527
00:48:16,557 --> 00:48:21,597
flood level is closer the actual exposure and trips we have some advisers and measure which

528
00:48:21,597 --> 00:48:26,917
sort of tend to integrate with the person 's blood blood level looks like over a period of a few months and just

529
00:48:26,917 --> 00:48:31,965
that moment when you check their blood and there's been so many studies done that we can

530
00:48:31,965 --> 00:48:37,065
say for you know person of this age maybe a child with blonde black between this

531
00:48:37,065 --> 00:48:42,805
and this. we expect the CVs adverse outcomes to you. so

532
00:48:42,805 --> 00:48:48,525
I think that's so many studies been thought about file markers of let

533
00:48:48,525 --> 00:48:54,225
you understand what you're looking at one of meeting. okay. many of agents the.

534
00:48:54,225 --> 00:48:59,505
we just don't have that level of detail. so sometimes a little even though it sounds great

535
00:48:59,505 --> 00:49:04,625
well let's find out what's actually in the person 's body. just it can be hard to interpret. if you don't

536
00:49:04,625 --> 00:49:09,945
have enough background information to do it. I don't know someone is doing industrial hygiene.

537
00:49:09,945 --> 00:49:15,305
but it it do contradict things you've heard so far about biological measures

538
00:49:15,305 --> 00:49:20,345
there's a scene in keeping with us. thank anything. okay. on live the same

539
00:49:20,345 --> 00:49:25,885
page. alright. employment

540
00:49:25,885 --> 00:49:30,943
records. they have a lot of strength that written records are

541
00:49:30,943 --> 00:49:36,123
more reliable than that rate although sometimes combine the two can be the best.

542
00:49:36,123 --> 00:49:41,223
not like be reporting by somebody didn't change where their records based

543
00:49:41,223 --> 00:49:46,243
on whether or not someone developed the disease later that being unusual situation. they can

544
00:49:46,243 --> 00:49:51,963
be extensive. um give you days duration and

545
00:49:51,963 --> 00:49:57,903
you can. if you've formulated an exposure job exposure matrix maybe based on

546
00:49:57,903 --> 00:50:03,123
quantitative measurements personal air samples. you can use you can use the records

547
00:50:03,123 --> 00:50:08,543
of someone that didn't actually have a personal air sample. that individual didn't have one

548
00:50:08,543 --> 00:50:13,583
but you say oh they work in the same department and the same job or I have all these measurements and

549
00:50:13,583 --> 00:50:19,003
I I think I can do a decent job estimating with the person 's exposure was when they are on their job.

550
00:50:19,003 --> 00:50:24,023
so those are all great things. weaknesses misses the employer has to

551
00:50:24,023 --> 00:50:29,501
clock rate usually to give them to you. sometimes it's very hard to interpret the information

552
00:50:29,501 --> 00:50:34,521
things come up like I just had some plan I said

553
00:50:34,521 --> 00:50:39,881
earlier you know if if you if people get paid

554
00:50:39,881 --> 00:50:45,021
based on what their job. so that often helps to have decent records

555
00:50:45,021 --> 00:50:50,501
because it involves payroll and a lot of election the pay the problem is

556
00:50:50,501 --> 00:50:55,621
sometimes if you have this experience like in a factory situation

557
00:50:55,621 --> 00:51:00,921
you sit down and interview someone and and by the way I usually

558
00:51:00,921 --> 00:51:06,081
if you're doing an occupational funny living human beings that you can talk to the people who

559
00:51:06,081 --> 00:51:11,421
study. usually this is the best idea is you get the written record.

560
00:51:11,421 --> 00:51:16,741
you look at it first. you can sit down with the individual and it says it says here from

561
00:51:16,741 --> 00:51:22,221
July two thousand and eleven through August of two thousand

562
00:51:22,221 --> 00:51:27,761
thirteen. you were working on this job in this department is that right

563
00:51:27,761 --> 00:51:33,051
and exact oh right well they had me

564
00:51:33,051 --> 00:51:38,291
I mean that part started and that's what they said but actually I got blown out

565
00:51:38,291 --> 00:51:43,311
to another department for each month and even all it

566
00:51:43,311 --> 00:51:48,551
says I was working it was I over summer the. so that that's a lot of things. actually

567
00:51:48,551 --> 00:51:53,651
usually the best thing is to have the written record and then try to verify

568
00:51:53,651 --> 00:51:59,931
talking individual. it's if living a. okay.

569
00:51:59,931 --> 00:52:05,031
Ed the other thing. it's very time consuming and costly the abstract

570
00:52:05,031 --> 00:52:10,371
all this information for these records. if it's worth doing to do a good study and

571
00:52:10,371 --> 00:52:15,431
sometimes you can get great information but for a large

572
00:52:15,431 --> 00:52:20,471
scale occupational study. it's not unusual. if

573
00:52:20,471 --> 00:52:25,911
you have somebody good. so how long did it takes a lot to look through all these records

574
00:52:25,911 --> 00:52:31,087
public figure out how they are actually assignments those are some jobs models

575
00:52:31,087 --> 00:52:37,947
based on what was in the records and you have and maybe the

576
00:52:37,947 --> 00:52:43,027
thousand people on the stage and casualty free first year. we

577
00:52:43,027 --> 00:52:48,087
had a more one person doing it but if one person and do it. I personally have had to do it for

578
00:52:48,087 --> 00:52:53,087
three years level of intensity which you do

579
00:52:53,087 --> 00:53:00,607
to records and figure out what's you're doing with them. okay.

580
00:53:00,607 --> 00:53:07,119
for for exposures. easy to obtain an expensive

581
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:12,359
so there's a possibility recording by people especially if it's like a case

582
00:53:12,359 --> 00:53:18,319
control study people got sick. trying to figure out reasons he became sick in my life he remembered things

583
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:23,479
that kind of thing. bye. I thing is I mean there's been a lot of talk

584
00:53:23,479 --> 00:53:29,859
about if somebody somehow three four maybe five jobs

585
00:53:29,859 --> 00:53:35,039
Jackson 's average person give you pretty accurate information.

586
00:53:35,039 --> 00:53:40,079
roughly about what years they worked which jobs and what they are

587
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:45,579
actually doing their job and maybe what they're exposed to but if you have somebody in front his of head

588
00:53:45,579 --> 00:53:50,599
eight nine ten jobs you know like really I mean it's really

589
00:53:50,599 --> 00:53:55,639
deteriorated. it's just your average person can't recall

590
00:53:55,639 --> 00:54:00,819
that many different jobs of the actors. I don't know there's probably some of you in this room are older maybe

591
00:54:00,819 --> 00:54:06,376
of an interesting career that there are some some of you've done like that you had real jobs like

592
00:54:06,376 --> 00:54:11,996
five or six different jobs and probably when you get up around six even though you

593
00:54:11,996 --> 00:54:17,276
probably broader than the average person walking on the street. still it's hard to recall

594
00:54:17,276 --> 00:54:22,396
and do you get what were the dates of that. what exactly did I do for six different jobs right there could be a lot of

595
00:54:22,396 --> 00:54:27,576
jobs to remember all that. only had two jobs your in life not so

596
00:54:27,576 --> 00:54:32,736
off. okay. so and so it maybe hard to come to

597
00:54:32,736 --> 00:54:37,916
things like that can be issues. alright. so let's talk about

598
00:54:37,916 --> 00:54:43,616
bit more about precision validity of decisions about whether these random there

599
00:54:43,616 --> 00:54:48,636
and one otherwise you deal with grand America and it's expensive. it's Tuesday I mean if you make sure you have

600
00:54:48,636 --> 00:54:54,396
a large enough sample size enough people in the study that statistically

601
00:54:54,396 --> 00:54:59,556
you expect. you can expect them to reliably be representative of the population

602
00:54:59,556 --> 00:55:05,072
drawn are from the small your sample is the big of the chances that

603
00:55:05,072 --> 00:55:10,952
they won't be representative of the population drew them from just by chance

604
00:55:10,952 --> 00:55:16,292
whereas validity had to do with systematic errors you some

605
00:55:16,292 --> 00:55:21,632
kind of bias is been introduced. just a matter that's five days selection

606
00:55:21,632 --> 00:55:26,952
bias information by confounding. there's so sort the main varieties that we've touched

607
00:55:26,952 --> 00:55:32,092
on the examples of all those. so that's where it's not just you didn't have a big enough

608
00:55:32,092 --> 00:55:37,872
study you. your information wasn't high enough if. there's something

609
00:55:37,872 --> 00:55:42,972
something wrong about how people got into the study or how you're

610
00:55:42,972 --> 00:55:48,152
obtaining information about their exposure or the disease status or about food.

611
00:55:48,152 --> 00:55:53,192
we forgot to collect data on all those other risk factors normally with practice

612
00:55:53,192 --> 00:55:59,172
the disease of interest. now we can't check on whether they were acting as can founders in our population.

613
00:55:59,172 --> 00:56:06,480
where you get a systematic problem. got a wrong answer. alright

614
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:11,480
I so think some of this already. so I was talking about sampling error. if

615
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:16,580
you the large population I get unlucky and it's not in your study is not great

616
00:56:16,580 --> 00:56:21,780
for the people in the study are not represented underlying population but measurement air is also very

617
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:27,100
important. so that was used I think for example it's coming up is actually using primary function

618
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:32,260
passing which we talked about quite a bit in here so that's a good example. so

619
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:37,320
it's actually hard. I think I mention get

620
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:42,380
in a field study to get people to do this maneuver. we look

621
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:47,480
not reliable enough that you actually get good data on what their true lung capacity

622
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:52,760
is at the time. okay. not easy. actually takes a lot to do it.

623
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:57,800
so. so if you can get everybody get their best effort.

624
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:03,260
everything is done correctly. they're still gonna be some standard you know population

625
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:08,438
that you we're in you're starting to be some standard deviation around whatever the main value was

626
00:57:08,438 --> 00:57:13,618
right. but if you two year. if you do

627
00:57:13,618 --> 00:57:18,638
a sloppy job and don't get people to always give their

628
00:57:18,638 --> 00:57:23,638
best effort don't do everything right. you can. it's possible you'll do it in a

629
00:57:23,638 --> 00:57:28,878
way that's not bio meaning on your your your main for your population

630
00:57:28,878 --> 00:57:34,178
is close to what the true meaning lies but you'll have way more variability much larger

631
00:57:34,178 --> 00:57:39,358
standard deviations then you needed to have because you didn't do.

632
00:57:39,358 --> 00:57:44,418
you didn't perform that in the best possible way and that turned out to make

633
00:57:44,418 --> 00:57:51,058
a big difference. I'm gonna have to go to side the. see how far ahead it with

634
00:57:51,058 --> 00:57:56,498
right there. okay. I'm jumping ahead. so that the

635
00:57:56,498 --> 00:58:01,538
study where you if look at the latest. so

636
00:58:01,538 --> 00:58:06,634
this is a good example using things like LCD one calling function study. so

637
00:58:06,634 --> 00:58:11,634
if you look in the literature you look at the bad studies you actually and and

638
00:58:11,634 --> 00:58:18,274
I'd tell you that you know the standard error the mean I tell you this in this population

639
00:58:18,274 --> 00:58:23,454
mean I think the one with four point four zero. I mean.

640
00:58:23,454 --> 00:58:28,794
okay. I mostly telling people probably a lot of males but anyway standard

641
00:58:28,794 --> 00:58:34,714
with four point four. that was the main you know you'll see you know well done study.

642
00:58:34,714 --> 00:58:40,374
you you'll get something like a standard deviation of pointing to around that. that's the real variability

643
00:58:40,374 --> 00:58:45,554
in the population. okay. but if it's. you get a much

644
00:58:45,554 --> 00:58:50,694
bigger standard deviation and what this is showing here that the showing. I skip through a lot of things

645
00:58:50,694 --> 00:58:55,974
but you know how is the probability that

646
00:58:55,974 --> 00:59:01,434
if there is a true association state of nature the true association between

647
00:59:01,434 --> 00:59:06,914
exposure and your disease outcome in this case the message wind

648
00:59:06,914 --> 00:59:12,074
that you're going to say there's it from your study and you're gonna say there is

649
00:59:12,074 --> 00:59:17,414
a true association so if the probability of getting it right when there's

650
00:59:17,414 --> 00:59:22,434
when there's a true association. alright. so what this is showing you

651
00:59:22,434 --> 00:59:28,314
is that here. here's the well done study the real data and it's saying okay.

652
00:59:28,314 --> 00:59:33,494
and usually when you're submitting grand proposal to get funded.

653
00:59:33,494 --> 00:59:38,534
usually people like to see how that's great. I mean for your main outcome of the power that

654
00:59:38,534 --> 00:59:43,754
that we point eight. I have at least four out of five chance

655
00:59:43,754 --> 00:59:48,904
of finding real association if there is a real association out there to

656
00:59:48,904 --> 00:59:54,784
be found on with me about this man. okay. so

657
00:59:54,784 --> 01:00:00,344
and it's a matter of fact if you come back and you say if if I came back and I said here's my power calculations

658
01:00:00,344 --> 01:00:05,344
and all my power was point nine eight point nine nine. you do think

659
01:00:05,344 --> 01:00:10,384
the people review and everything oh that's great. that's gonna be really great study now that's how

660
01:00:10,384 --> 01:00:15,404
they're gonna say they're gonna say your study too big and cost you don't need

661
01:00:15,404 --> 01:00:20,444
to factor the power to cut the number of people in the sample and half. just so

662
01:00:20,444 --> 01:00:25,904
you know there's like that getting grandfathered. you wanna be like

663
01:00:25,904 --> 01:00:31,024
point eight point nine not too far about point nine of us they there's too many people in your study

664
01:00:31,024 --> 01:00:36,184
which is about to be about criticism. okay. so anyway here's what I'm trying to show

665
01:00:36,184 --> 01:00:41,244
you is it was only fifty people with the standard DAs deviation but it really should

666
01:00:41,244 --> 01:00:46,299
be if you do things very well. you're already almost at point eight and by the

667
01:00:46,299 --> 01:00:51,299
time you you know you get up to ninety people you're well about point nine this is one

668
01:00:51,299 --> 01:00:56,459
over here right. I would take the worst case scenario where you basically almost double

669
01:00:56,459 --> 01:01:02,199
your standard deviation just because you were sloppy so not saying introduced by them saying just fine

670
01:01:02,199 --> 01:01:07,479
the average is okay. but there's a lot of variability lot noise in it and

671
01:01:07,479 --> 01:01:12,579
you can see in that case with fifty people. you only have a power that's less than point

672
01:01:12,579 --> 01:01:17,639
three. so it's like only twenty five percent of the time we even come to the

673
01:01:17,639 --> 01:01:22,739
right conclusion right. if there is actually an association to be found and even

674
01:01:22,739 --> 01:01:27,799
if you get out much larger study hundred and fifty people. the power still

675
01:01:27,799 --> 01:01:33,359
only around sixty percent of time we say so what this

676
01:01:33,359 --> 01:01:38,559
this particular spot is time to drive home the point that

677
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:43,839
it's actually very important to do your measurements accurately as possible and a real

678
01:01:43,839 --> 01:01:49,471
study because it has a tremendous impact on whether or not you're gonna figure out

679
01:01:49,471 --> 01:01:54,791
if there's a tree association potentially possible between exposures you're interested in in the disease

680
01:01:54,791 --> 01:01:59,971
out here. alright that's why when I'm involved with all

681
01:01:59,971 --> 01:02:05,131
funny morbidity studies. we go through like I mean you think I'm boring

682
01:02:05,131 --> 01:02:10,131
you up here. if I was training you should be the person who's administering the p.m.

683
01:02:10,131 --> 01:02:15,131
Eastern study I'd make you go through this so many times that I. here listen to your routine what do you

684
01:02:15,131 --> 01:02:20,251
gonna say the to individual to explain what you want them to do and you get two words in a different

685
01:02:20,251 --> 01:02:25,391
order out they. I probably won't pay it that way try to do that because it

686
01:02:25,391 --> 01:02:30,491
ends up making a big difference right. it may make a difference between if there is something we all do fine. can

687
01:02:30,491 --> 01:02:35,531
you identify it or if it just lost in the noise because you have too much scatter

688
01:02:35,531 --> 01:02:41,471
on your view. okay.

689
01:02:41,471 --> 01:02:47,193
bye way. I'm actually sort of interested I realize that the underlying information here

690
01:02:47,193 --> 01:02:52,793
I'm assuming those of you that have done in ethnic studies especially I mean at class the

691
01:02:52,793 --> 01:02:58,013
general epidemiology especially if you got a couple you must've heard this all before

692
01:02:58,013 --> 01:03:03,373
but isn't this at all complimentary because it didn't put together a slightly different way than usually

693
01:03:03,373 --> 01:03:08,373
heard it because I'm trying. I'm attempting to bring so many things together.

694
01:03:08,373 --> 01:03:13,553
you can tell me the truth. you can tell me if you're just bored to tears. I'll live through it.

695
01:03:13,553 --> 01:03:18,793
I did their dishes are limited. if you have used

696
01:03:18,793 --> 01:03:25,913
that already know fair a amount of epidemiology. well I hope so

697
01:03:25,913 --> 01:03:32,173
that's two years. I kinda cry. okay.

698
01:03:32,173 --> 01:03:37,213
see I can always come back they were you're just probably smarter than most people in the classroom and you only have to hear it

699
01:03:37,213 --> 01:03:47,195
once and then you know you understand all the application. alright

700
01:03:47,195 --> 01:03:52,535
all right so we talked about that selection

701
01:03:52,535 --> 01:03:58,815
I think everyone knows we talk about the many times you probably know selection bias is when

702
01:03:58,815 --> 01:04:03,935
there's some consensus and either who gets into

703
01:04:03,935 --> 01:04:08,955
the study to start with or who stays in the study.

704
01:04:08,955 --> 01:04:14,035
long enough for you to click to date on them I so might

705
01:04:14,035 --> 01:04:19,055
basically if the relationship between exposure and disease

706
01:04:19,055 --> 01:04:24,275
and the people that ended up in your study is not the same as it was in the line

707
01:04:24,275 --> 01:04:29,415
population you're trying to draw them from that means that you have a problem selection bias you somehow

708
01:04:29,415 --> 01:04:34,675
collected people in a way it's not representative. so the thing I told you about a while

709
01:04:34,675 --> 01:04:39,735
back which I was also help person 's biases never run into the yard.

710
01:04:39,735 --> 01:04:44,821
mail and where I said it would be a really bad idea to

711
01:04:44,821 --> 01:04:50,461
do a case control study to see if cigarettes cause lung cancer and say I'm gonna take

712
01:04:50,461 --> 01:04:55,541
the person with lung cancer when I find out that the next person admitted we're not paying attention to how they made

713
01:04:55,541 --> 01:05:01,581
it. so they said the issue there is that you really want to know

714
01:05:01,581 --> 01:05:06,741
from the entire underlying population that the people

715
01:05:06,741 --> 01:05:12,861
in your study were drawn from everybody that if they got lung cancer might've ended up in hospital.

716
01:05:12,861 --> 01:05:17,921
you wanna know what the association is between cigarette smoking and lung cancer and that

717
01:05:17,921 --> 01:05:23,781
entire population and instead what you're getting is that

718
01:05:23,781 --> 01:05:28,781
people that smoked and got other diseases and cigarettes because like heart

719
01:05:28,781 --> 01:05:33,901
disease are much more likely end up in your study. so that's so that's selection

720
01:05:33,901 --> 01:05:39,381
by relation the association the strength of association between

721
01:05:39,381 --> 01:05:44,777
the cigarette smoking and the lung cancer is different in the population

722
01:05:44,777 --> 01:05:50,897
you're studying then it is in the underlying population you're trying to match up the difference because

723
01:05:50,897 --> 01:05:56,077
the cigarette smoking is not strongly tied to lung cancer because it's also tied

724
01:05:56,077 --> 01:06:04,497
all these other things which is in your control room. okay. that selection bias

725
01:06:04,497 --> 01:06:11,117
information via well. so it's where you just actually miss classify

726
01:06:11,117 --> 01:06:16,597
people and that classification it's differs

727
01:06:16,597 --> 01:06:22,577
in different groups in the study. so what we called differential missed clarification.

728
01:06:22,577 --> 01:06:27,635
so please I mean it's example bit people

729
01:06:27,635 --> 01:06:33,035
fall for him sometimes. so this guy 's in a cohort study supposed

730
01:06:33,035 --> 01:06:38,235
to do a more rigorous evaluation of

731
01:06:38,235 --> 01:06:43,355
the people didn't have exposure then the people that don't have exposure because you get

732
01:06:43,355 --> 01:06:50,935
a more rigorous workup medical evaluation of them. you're more likely to discover the disease.

733
01:06:50,935 --> 01:06:55,975
and so you you're

734
01:06:55,975 --> 01:07:01,375
correctly classify the disease because you look so carefully for

735
01:07:01,375 --> 01:07:07,115
almost always and all the people have exposure but you're often maybe classifying

736
01:07:07,115 --> 01:07:12,195
whether they have the disease or not and the people don't have exposure if you didn't do the same work

737
01:07:12,195 --> 01:07:17,335
medical work off on the people with exposure and without the exposure. so that's

738
01:07:17,335 --> 01:07:23,475
that's differential and the specifications what how someone gets classified

739
01:07:23,475 --> 01:07:29,150
in terms of disease that it actually depends on what their exposure was

740
01:07:29,150 --> 01:07:34,410
okay I'm

741
01:07:34,410 --> 01:07:39,450
I'm not good. alright. there's different guys card size casings both studies.

742
01:07:39,450 --> 01:07:44,950
so there's also a non- differential mess classification which

743
01:07:44,950 --> 01:07:50,490
is the exception for that if you can show in issue with people up in the group

744
01:07:50,490 --> 01:07:56,210
certain ways in general. usually what happens.

745
01:07:56,210 --> 01:08:01,410
so that does mean you just get things wrong. round but it but whether or not you say

746
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:06,450
they have a disease doesn't depend on whether they have exposure didn't have a probability

747
01:08:06,450 --> 01:08:11,490
if it's okay they have the disease. but you're just recently misdiagnosed it. you think some people have

748
01:08:11,490 --> 01:08:16,750
the disease but they don't and vice versa. so you know that situation usually

749
01:08:16,750 --> 01:08:22,210
you get biased towards the no towards an hypothesis hypothesis that there's no true association

750
01:08:22,210 --> 01:08:27,504
between exposure and the disease. okay so that's not differential

751
01:08:27,504 --> 01:08:33,484
the classification I mean you know that gotta be true because take the extreme case

752
01:08:33,484 --> 01:08:38,484
I don't have a claim with me but pretend can I had a client. if I do but I kinda

753
01:08:38,484 --> 01:08:43,784
oh it's too much is work up all the CT scans and MRIs and drivers just it's too much

754
01:08:43,784 --> 01:08:49,384
but since I do have the disease and who doesn't. bye. flip I'll the car Lance for heads they have the decision

755
01:08:49,384 --> 01:08:55,124
go to find an association with any exposure no matter what it is. no that would be the extreme

756
01:08:55,124 --> 01:09:00,744
form of time different from the specifications. you miss classifying people

757
01:09:00,744 --> 01:09:06,024
hardly but nothing to do with with having exposure or not. if you has got go to with

758
01:09:06,024 --> 01:09:12,544
anything. nothing to say have a disease or not. okay.

759
01:09:12,544 --> 01:09:17,664
alright I don't I don't think I'll go through all this well.

760
01:09:17,664 --> 01:09:24,232
you six almost everyone here is pricing this diagram. basically saying

761
01:09:24,232 --> 01:09:29,712
you made to kind of tears. if reality the trees data nature. if if there actually

762
01:09:29,712 --> 01:09:34,732
is an association between exposure and disease.

763
01:09:34,732 --> 01:09:39,912
I'm sorry. okay. no hypothesis is Paul. okay. this is

764
01:09:39,912 --> 01:09:45,592
reality if there is an association than if you just give you kind of a cushion there is no association

765
01:09:45,592 --> 01:09:50,772
you've made a type two error versus if in reality there is

766
01:09:50,772 --> 01:09:55,772
no real association and you come to the conclusion that there is you made a time one there.

767
01:09:55,772 --> 01:10:01,172
I think everyone knows that. if you Don you can just read the summer for the little bit.

768
01:10:01,172 --> 01:10:06,252
okay. and we're not the retire up our calculations

769
01:10:06,252 --> 01:10:11,352
and out. other than to say all these things I've been talking about including

770
01:10:11,352 --> 01:10:16,592
like how much power you wanna have to get funded. just probably polish and discuss

771
01:10:16,592 --> 01:10:23,114
it that way. I'm trying to tell you about the reality. um

772
01:10:23,114 --> 01:10:28,374
your power calculations have take account of that and they basically saying okay. under

773
01:10:28,374 --> 01:10:33,434
the assumptions and I can do it you know if you write a grant saying I can defend these assumptions here's

774
01:10:33,434 --> 01:10:39,474
why is my medicines at reasonable estimate. I do all these functions

775
01:10:39,474 --> 01:10:44,754
here is the power I would have with this many people here

776
01:10:44,754 --> 01:10:50,854
and if you have more people in the study you have more power. that's I should've said

777
01:10:50,854 --> 01:10:56,294
you know the value alpha heritage and tape which is to make

778
01:10:56,294 --> 01:11:01,334
the say that there is no

779
01:11:01,334 --> 01:11:06,434
association when there actually is. anyway you have to set your

780
01:11:06,434 --> 01:11:11,534
house air before you calculate your beta comes to

781
01:11:11,534 --> 01:11:17,794
affect each other. so when you do power calculations you specified. I'm using

782
01:11:17,794 --> 01:11:22,954
our phone level of whatever usually point oh five and then and then you're showing which

783
01:11:22,954 --> 01:11:27,954
power calculations and I'm not gonna go through all

784
01:11:27,954 --> 01:11:33,194
this because we're not gonna do power calculations here. okay. so

785
01:11:33,194 --> 01:11:38,214
usually get through everything. I saw you put

786
01:11:38,214 --> 01:11:43,254
this all together and here strategy for achieving a valid study. I'll

787
01:11:43,254 --> 01:11:48,314
come this well defined you know the car carrier for diagnosis and you can

788
01:11:48,314 --> 01:11:53,714
you can agree on them. you can confirm it with

789
01:11:53,714 --> 01:11:59,014
the proper medical test. um solid example.

790
01:11:59,014 --> 01:12:04,214
if you wanna if you try. you have a new hypothesis is there a relationship between

791
01:12:04,214 --> 01:12:09,314
some certain exposure. the looked at before and this disease and the dates.

792
01:12:09,314 --> 01:12:15,354
the third thing is that it's probably better to pick severe cases of the disease.

793
01:12:15,354 --> 01:12:20,696
so that there's so it's pretty much on a critical that they actually all have it

794
01:12:20,696 --> 01:12:27,036
if you have a choice. if you have enough people with severe disease for your study

795
01:12:27,036 --> 01:12:32,316
and your exposure assessment things and the things you have to

796
01:12:32,316 --> 01:12:37,856
use strategies that are acceptable. also as precise as possible

797
01:12:37,856 --> 01:12:43,476
and that sort of summarizes a lot of things we we are ready talk about

798
01:12:43,476 --> 01:12:48,476
on the one other thing in terms of selection bias. it's good. that's a funny

799
01:12:48,476 --> 01:12:53,476
way to worry it maybe be avoid refusal to participate clinicians and subject and the

800
01:12:53,476 --> 01:12:59,036
particular itself. so I thought saying is

801
01:12:59,036 --> 01:13:04,864
you're always gonna have to worry about whether you have on measured selection by

802
01:13:04,864 --> 01:13:10,124
if only sixty percent of the people you invited to the study agreed

803
01:13:10,124 --> 01:13:15,204
to participate because there's always to be the question was there something

804
01:13:15,204 --> 01:13:20,424
really different about the forty percent. it didn't participate and you just don't know

805
01:13:20,424 --> 01:13:25,504
and so you're everything you found out people in your study maybe true about that but it

806
01:13:25,504 --> 01:13:30,564
may not be representative underlying population. that's why the offer for a lot of kind of kinda

807
01:13:30,564 --> 01:13:35,944
make sure that you sign do the study and the way it is likely to

808
01:13:35,944 --> 01:13:42,964
weird people are gonna be comfortable with it and likely to reproduce. alright.

809
01:13:42,964 --> 01:13:48,144
so have data collection and I gave you the example

810
01:13:48,144 --> 01:13:53,204
of side train people to do. geez well I that's important. 's probably

811
01:13:53,204 --> 01:13:58,244
that I can't reference it always seems a bit high. lighthearted things to train

812
01:13:58,244 --> 01:14:03,435
people to do well his chief minister questionnaire as well I'm John

813
01:14:03,435 --> 01:14:08,475
never hired doctors didn't your see questionnaires because they're trying to do the opposite of what you

814
01:14:08,475 --> 01:14:13,655
want them to do. I've said this before. yes they're trained at pro

815
01:14:13,655 --> 01:14:18,735
because they say oh this person I have this wrong with them so they start asking questions aren't on the

816
01:14:18,735 --> 01:14:23,735
page and that's not what you want you want every every one interview and ask questions the same

817
01:14:23,735 --> 01:14:29,035
way they're all comfortable. alright. so

818
01:14:29,035 --> 01:14:35,855
and now it's 's Rick will come back to that. alright so

819
01:14:35,855 --> 01:14:41,455
wanna get through that. we'll get started with it. so that type of status I revisited.

820
01:14:41,455 --> 01:14:46,815
this is sort of like more or less the hierarchy saying in randomized

821
01:14:46,815 --> 01:14:53,775
trial where you got you doing experiments might be of the highest in here in quality

822
01:14:53,775 --> 01:14:59,075
but we usually can't do that in occupational and environmental settings. prospective

823
01:14:59,075 --> 01:15:04,781
cohort study where you follow individuals for in real time it's very strong

824
01:15:04,781 --> 01:15:10,521
design and a retrospective cohort study

825
01:15:10,521 --> 01:15:15,741
is similar to the true perspective. there you have to look at past exposures and

826
01:15:15,741 --> 01:15:21,461
depending with the diseases after nine past disease.

827
01:15:21,461 --> 01:15:26,841
we'll talk more about as American S ten p.m. hours next time

828
01:15:26,841 --> 01:15:32,361
doing well. I actually did the same same area here. so

829
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:37,681
we can't remember. have we actually I know I discussed that some are state we discussed any p.m. our studies

830
01:15:37,681 --> 01:15:43,061
today. this is proportional mortality ratio. so this is where

831
01:15:43,061 --> 01:15:49,941
somebody. okay. compared to the US population

832
01:15:49,941 --> 01:15:55,241
higher percentage of people that died and this call hard died

833
01:15:55,241 --> 01:16:00,381
from lung cancer. then you would expect based on my year

834
01:16:00,381 --> 01:16:06,337
they died but their age wise but the race was what their gender was and therefore

835
01:16:06,337 --> 01:16:14,297
concluding and savings are all workers that plant. I'm concluding or something at this facility.

836
01:16:14,297 --> 01:16:19,377
probably constantly related with lung cancer. so that would

837
01:16:19,377 --> 01:16:25,597
be like p.m. our study it's. different. that's a minute tomorrow. did you actually estimate the absolute

838
01:16:25,597 --> 01:16:30,677
number of deaths from lung cancer. I mean you have absolute number and

839
01:16:30,677 --> 01:16:35,957
you're comparing it to what the estimate the is best number in a larger population

840
01:16:35,957 --> 01:16:41,817
like the US population. I cross sectional yard and talked about those. so

841
01:16:41,817 --> 01:16:46,857
I paid controlled study and we talked about case series. we didn't really say anything about

842
01:16:46,857 --> 01:16:52,017
it not really a study but it said it's seven percent a person 's disease

843
01:16:52,017 --> 01:16:57,037
well I have exposure to risk factors he so why does that would tell me if

844
01:16:57,037 --> 01:17:02,257
you have a friends like that. why does that not allow you to reach any kind of conclusion

845
01:17:02,257 --> 01:17:07,283
about the association disease

846
01:17:07,283 --> 01:17:13,283
why would respect or see what's missing there. maybe this is too.

847
01:17:13,283 --> 01:17:18,283
if I'll tell you if I read if I say I found the twenty five

848
01:17:18,283 --> 01:17:23,543
percent of people who had multiple sclerosis

849
01:17:23,543 --> 01:17:28,583
had fixed had been exposed to pickles

850
01:17:28,583 --> 01:17:33,923
