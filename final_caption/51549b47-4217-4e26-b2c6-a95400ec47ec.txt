1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,900
All right, good afternoon everybody.

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:05,740
How many of you are so saturated with information that it's really not gonna

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,740
matter what I say at this point.

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:08,506
>> [LAUGH]. >> Yeah.

5
00:00:08,506 --> 00:00:11,750
Good, I like a pliable audience if you will.

6
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:15,901
So I wanna take ten minutes of your time and talk to you about a certificate

7
00:00:15,901 --> 00:00:19,851
program that I direct here called the Certificate in Risk Science and

8
00:00:19,851 --> 00:00:20,840
Human Health.

9
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:25,005
We'll try to keep this, as I said, relatively light and airy just given

10
00:00:25,005 --> 00:00:29,440
the time of day and the fact that you are just inundated with information.

11
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,467
But I do wanna just take a quick step back, presumably none of you would be

12
00:00:33,467 --> 00:00:37,450
here if you didn't have a strong interest in protecting human health.

13
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:40,450
So that's already one step towards an interest in this certificate.

14
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,211
It's also probably not a surprise to any of you that there's health

15
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:47,840
risks all around us all the time.

16
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,358
It's getting harder and harder unfortunately for

17
00:00:51,358 --> 00:00:54,730
us to make appropriate health based decisions.

18
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:57,842
As our society gets increasingly complex,

19
00:00:57,842 --> 00:01:02,320
as the environment that we live in gets increasingly complex.

20
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,944
And so back in 2012 when we launched this certificate,

21
00:01:05,944 --> 00:01:10,872
we identify that there's really a need for well-trained, both scientists and

22
00:01:10,872 --> 00:01:15,009
practitioners who can help us address both existing health risks.

23
00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:19,726
Things we know about for say hundreds of years, if any of you have heard of for

24
00:01:19,726 --> 00:01:24,280
example, lead being bad for you, cadmium, noise, air pollution.

25
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,910
These things aren't new, they're very much existing health risks, but

26
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:30,120
we're still very much grappling with them.

27
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:34,301
On the flip side, we have emerging risks all the time as well.

28
00:01:34,301 --> 00:01:39,619
So are e cigarettes a good idea from a health risk perspective?

29
00:01:39,619 --> 00:01:42,706
Is introducing nanoparticles into the clothing we wear,

30
00:01:42,706 --> 00:01:47,118
the products we use on our skin, is that a good idea from a health risk perspective?

31
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:47,980
We don't know.

32
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:52,946
And so the idea behind this certificate is to give you the training you need to be

33
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:58,063
able to consider these both emerging and existing threats, and try to figure out

34
00:01:58,063 --> 00:02:03,360
how do we balance those against progress from a social and financial perspective?

35
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,329
So hopefully we can all agree if we're making decisions about the health of

36
00:02:07,329 --> 00:02:09,912
people, you, me, United States, the globe,

37
00:02:09,912 --> 00:02:13,020
we really need to make those decisions based on evidence.

38
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:18,664
Once we decide that an action is needed, we really need to take that evidence and

39
00:02:18,664 --> 00:02:22,140
translate that to some practical solutions.

40
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:26,413
Of course, that demands that we have knowledge from all sorts of disciplines,

41
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:28,471
public health being only one of them.

42
00:02:28,471 --> 00:02:33,210
So we're part of the solution, we're not the solution all by itself.

43
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:38,126
And again, this key of translating the scientific evidence to something that

44
00:02:38,126 --> 00:02:41,030
might actually motivate change in society and

45
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:45,340
government wherever we determined that change is necessary.

46
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:48,353
And so the overall goal here of risk management,

47
00:02:48,353 --> 00:02:53,277
one of the elements of the Risk Science certificate is we really wanna guarantee

48
00:02:53,277 --> 00:02:58,440
that we have sustainable social, technological and financial growth.

49
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:03,930
So when we designed this certificate, we very purposely made it very flexible.

50
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:07,962
And so we wanted this to be open to people in an MPH, in an MS,

51
00:03:07,962 --> 00:03:12,483
in the business school, in other places around campus, to try and

52
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:16,540
again get some interdisciplinary cross talk going here.

53
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:21,480
And so we feel that the certificate provides is basically an opportunity for

54
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,741
you to take some course work outside of sort of your comfort zone.

55
00:03:25,741 --> 00:03:28,400
You're gonna be taking lots of courses in public health.

56
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,890
This gives you an opportunity to get in touch maybe with folks in engineering,

57
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:36,564
over in the policy school, folks from literature, science and

58
00:03:36,564 --> 00:03:39,380
the arts, economics, communications, etc.

59
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:44,790
Again, to sort of instill in you that need for cross disciplinary communication.

60
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:49,092
And when we designed the certificate, we came up with a couple of clusters that we

61
00:03:49,092 --> 00:03:51,650
felt were very important for people to master.

62
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:55,461
So you'll see there's a number of clusters listed up here five,

63
00:03:55,461 --> 00:03:58,385
three of these clusters is what we consider core.

64
00:03:58,385 --> 00:04:02,220
Public health, kind of a no brainer you can check that one off right away.

65
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:05,140
A second cluster is risk communication.

66
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:08,867
How do we talk about risk with people in risk management?

67
00:04:08,867 --> 00:04:11,470
What steps can we take to actually reduce risk?

68
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:17,860
And the third court cluster here is how do we conduct a quantitative risk assessment?

69
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:21,516
By quantifying, we can start to compare apples to apples by saying,

70
00:04:21,516 --> 00:04:25,611
well, how much of a risk is this in terms of life years lost to this other risk,

71
00:04:25,611 --> 00:04:29,840
and the one that's worse might be the one that we focus our resources on.

72
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,641
As I said, we wanna give you the opportunity though to tailor their

73
00:04:32,641 --> 00:04:33,351
certificates.

74
00:04:33,351 --> 00:04:36,071
So we have two additional clusters that you choose between.

75
00:04:36,071 --> 00:04:40,864
One of them is sort of systems thinking about managing risk, and

76
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:45,340
the other one is a more financial benefit cost cluster.

77
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,621
So we've got some requirements here.

78
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,865
Again, given the late time in the day,

79
00:04:49,865 --> 00:04:53,129
I'm not gonna dive into these too much, but basically we

80
00:04:53,129 --> 00:04:57,149
do require to have some courses from all three of those core clusters.

81
00:04:57,149 --> 00:05:01,930
And then courses from one of the two optional clusters there.

82
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:06,021
And so there's a little algorithm here to make sure that you've got enough course

83
00:05:06,021 --> 00:05:07,700
credits in each of the clusters.

84
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:11,712
Again, I think the exciting thing about this certificate is it gets you out of

85
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:13,268
the School of Public Health.

86
00:05:13,268 --> 00:05:17,329
You'll be learning a tremendous amount in the school here, and it's all quite

87
00:05:17,329 --> 00:05:21,147
valuable, but I think it's a lost opportunity if you don't branch out and

88
00:05:21,147 --> 00:05:22,981
take courses elsewhere on campus.

89
00:05:22,981 --> 00:05:25,020
And in pursuing the certificate here,

90
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:28,046
you may find yourself over at the Ross School of Business,

91
00:05:28,046 --> 00:05:32,646
at the School of Information, SEAS, the School for Environment and sustainability.

92
00:05:32,646 --> 00:05:35,190
Maybe up on north campus and engineering again,

93
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:38,810
to give you some exposure to other disciplinary perspectives here.

94
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:42,737
So this gnarly table you can't read, it's on the website,

95
00:05:42,737 --> 00:05:44,980
hopefully in a more legible form.

96
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:49,196
But I'll show you this just to give you an idea of just how flexible we've tried to

97
00:05:49,196 --> 00:05:51,191
make the risk science certificates.

98
00:05:51,191 --> 00:05:55,160
So we've got different departments and units around campus here listed on

99
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,945
the left, and then we have different courses that you can choose from.

100
00:05:58,945 --> 00:06:03,100
And you can see here well which cluster would that particular course satisfy.

101
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:06,639
So if this feels a little bit like a choose your own adventure design,

102
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:07,510
it very much is.

103
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:11,008
So you would ideally at the start of your program here say, well,

104
00:06:11,008 --> 00:06:15,411
how did this menu of courses, which ones of these seem the most interesting to me?

105
00:06:15,411 --> 00:06:18,994
And then you can start to map out well what might a certificate look like,

106
00:06:18,994 --> 00:06:21,815
that gets me over to Engineering or the Business School or

107
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:24,440
wherever you think your primary interests lie.

108
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,476
So again, we've tried to make this as easy as possible by giving you

109
00:06:27,476 --> 00:06:28,350
this matrix here.

110
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:33,324
And the other purpose of showing this as you can see, there are indeed a lot of

111
00:06:33,324 --> 00:06:37,758
units around campus that offer courses that we would give credit for

112
00:06:37,758 --> 00:06:40,430
towards the Risk Science Certificate.

113
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:42,236
You might say, well, gosh,

114
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:46,081
I'm really interested in kind of a quantitative aspect here.

115
00:06:46,081 --> 00:06:50,732
So how do I decide is getting cancer from this project worse than getting lung

116
00:06:50,732 --> 00:06:53,040
disease from the second product?

117
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:56,158
We need to do some quantitative risk assessment to be able to compare those

118
00:06:56,158 --> 00:06:56,680
directly.

119
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,192
That might steer you more towards taking courses in my home department,

120
00:07:00,192 --> 00:07:01,880
Environmental Health Sciences.

121
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,895
Maybe you wanna focus more on if we've identified a risk,

122
00:07:04,895 --> 00:07:08,785
how do we communicate that out to the public, to policymakers, whoever.

123
00:07:08,785 --> 00:07:12,540
That might take you more towards health behavior, health education.

124
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:16,451
Maybe you decide I'm really interested in the management of risk through policies,

125
00:07:16,451 --> 00:07:19,602
maybe through other types of controls we can put into place that might

126
00:07:19,602 --> 00:07:21,580
take you to health management and policy.

127
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:25,094
And maybe you say no, I'm really interested in sustainability,

128
00:07:25,094 --> 00:07:28,418
this is where it's at, and that might actually take you out and

129
00:07:28,418 --> 00:07:31,701
I apologize, I thought I cut all these acronym transitions.

130
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:34,983
Its what used to be the School of Natural Resources and the Environment, and

131
00:07:34,983 --> 00:07:37,360
is now the School of Environment and Sustainability.

132
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,010
So again, we can work with you, you can use the matrix to try to

133
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:46,860
decide what is the right selection or variety of courses for me.

134
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:50,091
What do you need to do if you want to get this certificate?

135
00:07:50,091 --> 00:07:53,051
Well, it's very consistent with what you've heard about the other certificates.

136
00:07:53,051 --> 00:07:57,789
So you put in basically a declaration of intent form where you say

137
00:07:57,789 --> 00:08:00,620
I'm interested in the certificate.

138
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:05,187
You can take any of these courses in any sequence you want, keeping in mind though,

139
00:08:05,187 --> 00:08:07,481
that some of them do have prerequisites.

140
00:08:07,481 --> 00:08:11,417
So you're probably not just gonna jump into a high level engineering class

141
00:08:11,417 --> 00:08:15,430
without having taken maybe a lower level engineering class, for example.

142
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:19,602
Like all the certificates you need a B in these courses to get the credit for

143
00:08:19,602 --> 00:08:20,440
the course.

144
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:24,006
Again, you ought to be able to do this certificate actually with no external

145
00:08:24,006 --> 00:08:26,068
input from me, just guided by the website,

146
00:08:26,068 --> 00:08:29,323
but I'm always happy to meet with folks pursuing this certificate.

147
00:08:29,323 --> 00:08:32,803
Then you apply to graduate with the certificate, they audit everything and if

148
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:36,610
it all looks good, you get the certificate issued and it turns up on your transcript.

149
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:40,092
Which is a really nice thing that I'm sure has already been emphasized

150
00:08:40,092 --> 00:08:41,230
about certificates.

151
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:46,626
So let me just wind down here and say for a moment, if I were in your shoes, I would

152
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:52,380
be asking myself, well, why would I want to do this certificate versus the others?

153
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:57,357
Honestly, to be completely truthful with you, I would say don't necessarily do this

154
00:08:57,357 --> 00:09:01,470
certificate, but I would very much encourage you to do a certificate.

155
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:05,696
It's a really nice way for you to augment your credentials with the NPH,

156
00:09:05,696 --> 00:09:10,005
to say not only have I taken all the courses that my classmates have taken.

157
00:09:10,005 --> 00:09:13,839
But I've also sort of specialized in this additional area that gives

158
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,021
me extra depth if you will, or extra breath depending on the certificate.

159
00:09:18,021 --> 00:09:21,201
So I would encourage you to do one of the certificates.

160
00:09:21,201 --> 00:09:24,980
Of course, my favorite is this one, that's probably no surprise to anybody.

161
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:28,203
I do think that this certificate can give you a different

162
00:09:28,203 --> 00:09:32,814
perspective on how we might manage human health all the way up to a global scale.

163
00:09:32,814 --> 00:09:36,160
And how we can promote that health by managing and

164
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,520
controlling risks that are within our control.

165
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,925
I think the certificate gives you opportunities of course for personal and

166
00:09:42,925 --> 00:09:46,601
professional growth, some great networking opportunities, good internship

167
00:09:46,601 --> 00:09:49,760
opportunities that are really kind of tailored to the certificate.

168
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,341
And of course, most of you are here to get a J-O-B at the end of your degree,

169
00:09:54,341 --> 00:09:59,240
we've had a really good track record of getting our students in the great jobs.

170
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,755
So they've gone on to work for government, they've gone on to work for NGOs,

171
00:10:02,755 --> 00:10:06,456
several of the merit consulting companies now, probably making twice what I do.

172
00:10:06,456 --> 00:10:08,480
>> [LAUGH].

173
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,710
>> Don't take that as a lot of money by the way, but it's twice as much.

174
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:12,242
>> [LAUGH].

175
00:10:12,242 --> 00:10:14,548
>> So, and the other opportunity here,

176
00:10:14,548 --> 00:10:18,378
I think it's just from a personal satisfaction perspective.

177
00:10:18,378 --> 00:10:22,425
Any of these certificates are gonna give you a little additional ability to go out

178
00:10:22,425 --> 00:10:25,875
and do a better job basically in protecting the health of the public,

179
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,460
which is what we're all about at the end of the day.

180
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:33,271
So I hope this is sort of intrigued you, may be interested you in a little bit.

181
00:10:33,271 --> 00:10:35,600
You're certainly welcome to visit the website.

182
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,990
You've got the links all embedded in here.

183
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:40,958
I'm also happy to meet with any of you one on one and

184
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:45,640
we're having an information session on September 11th at 10:00 AM.

185
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:49,213
So I'd encourage any of you who can make it to that session to come and

186
00:10:49,213 --> 00:10:51,640
we can have a small group discussion.

187
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:57,370
So with that, I apologize for drumming you with yet more information.

188
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:00,453
I hope this has been at least a little bit interesting,

189
00:11:00,453 --> 00:11:02,941
I think this is a quite useful certificate.

190
00:11:02,941 --> 00:11:06,142
But again, I think all the certificates that we offer here are are really worth

191
00:11:06,142 --> 00:11:06,781
a second look.

192
00:11:06,781 --> 00:11:08,816
And so with that I'll take questions, and I see one.

193
00:11:08,816 --> 00:11:10,149
>> Sir, I'm super interest in your program and

194
00:11:10,149 --> 00:11:13,120
I visited your website is at Netflix a couple of weeks ago.

195
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,550
>> Okay, [LAUGH].

196
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:17,475
>> I saw that some of the classes in particular for 4A and

197
00:11:17,475 --> 00:11:21,573
4B have a long range of prerequisite, like in last module in game theory.

198
00:11:21,573 --> 00:11:22,084
>> Yes.

199
00:11:22,084 --> 00:11:24,222
>> Is there a way that I can demonstrate competency, or

200
00:11:24,222 --> 00:11:27,138
should I be expected to take the prerequisite rule like employment, or

201
00:11:27,138 --> 00:11:28,756
experience, or something like that?

202
00:11:28,756 --> 00:11:30,695
>> Yeah, that's a great question, so

203
00:11:30,695 --> 00:11:34,780
I would say we can back this out to any class you're looking at across campus.

204
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,851
It never hurts to reach out to the instructor.

205
00:11:36,851 --> 00:11:40,660
And so there are a number of courses in there that have a few additional pre recs.

206
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:44,037
We've had students who have been able to talk to the instructor and

207
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:46,086
say, look, I have this professional,

208
00:11:46,086 --> 00:11:49,551
I have these classes as an undergrad, is this gonna be sufficient?

209
00:11:49,551 --> 00:11:52,540
And they ended up being able to getting in their class, and their were successful.

210
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,441
So yeah, absolutely.

211
00:11:54,441 --> 00:11:56,101
So don't hesitate to reach out,

212
00:11:56,101 --> 00:12:00,150
don't hesitate to reach out again when you don't get a response the first time.

213
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:00,931
>> [LAUGH]. >> You've

214
00:12:00,931 --> 00:12:03,830
probably already heard this about faculty, we stay pretty busy.

215
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:08,060
But yeah, definitely either reach out to me or to the course instructor correctly.

216
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,212
Cool, great question.

217
00:12:10,212 --> 00:12:16,438
Any others?

218
00:12:16,438 --> 00:12:18,346
All right, well, thank you so much,

219
00:12:18,346 --> 00:12:21,339
I will hope to see you on September 11th at 10 o'clock.

220
00:12:21,339 --> 00:12:26,124
>> [APPLAUSE]
