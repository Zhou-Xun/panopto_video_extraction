1
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:10,170
I forgot about that. It's about something else. You know, when you feel that you have all you needed.

2
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:17,460
You really think so? You just need to be smart.

3
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:30,200
Wouldn't 1989 and you're saying, Oh, nice.

4
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:36,480
Okay. Sorry, I'm dead. I felt like going back to the United States.

5
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:41,700
Yeah, like I started the away from flying.

6
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:49,500
I just didn't think that's what it was like there in Taiwan.

7
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:59,920
I knew that I wanted to take over the South Carolina city to try this out.

8
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:08,760
I think it's great.

9
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:16,600
I just letting their home, their friends, their areas are like, oh, next.

10
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:20,070
I know. No, it's closer on the route.

11
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:23,790
Oh, yeah. They're you so lucky and so nice.

12
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:32,880
But like, yeah, like snacks. So I think I'm all right and then I'll get there.

13
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:45,390
I'm sorry. You're like, nobody ever said that's, like, lost and wanting to play by late night.

14
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:49,050
This is not the way they're playing tomorrow.

15
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:54,990
Oh, my God. That's an appropriate time to finish.

16
00:01:55,050 --> 00:02:00,480
Yeah, I'm just like, I got it.

17
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:10,210
Thank you. I think I'll take my friend.

18
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:14,220
How are you? That's a cold afternoon to everybody.

19
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:20,790
I started the attendance list going around. So you sign it for me and grab that later.

20
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,520
Let's get kicked off with. What do you think? I know next week is.

21
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:36,480
Is Thanksgiving and you're celebrating, but when you're going home, that's your family and friends are staying here and get takeout.

22
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:43,530
So I placed on the screen things to be thankful for.

23
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,440
But you don't have to go on that list.

24
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:54,390
It's just truly something to get you to smile or get the juices flowing and what you think you might be thankful for.

25
00:02:55,060 --> 00:03:02,260
We are listening to Vanessa May and the violinist you ever seen in concert and.

26
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:06,680
Yeah, and it's.

27
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:11,220
Yeah. Now you on site go in there.

28
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,930
All right. Top corner to see something you're thankful for.

29
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,160
I am thankful for my family.

30
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:29,700
Awesome. Xbox next row down my health score helps very good something I thankful for my friends.

31
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,140
Very good. I was going to say that to friends. Okay.

32
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,440
I mean, you could see my health. My family's helped new friends.

33
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,560
You claimed new friends. Oh, I said I'm going to stay friends. Oh, okay.

34
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:46,710
New friends. Oh, well, look, just like I feel friends and family.

35
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:53,780
Friends and family and friends. The snow covered a lot.

36
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:58,230
Well, you got the list.

37
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:05,970
Okay, good. Oh, and sunsets and sunsets and sunrise.

38
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:14,280
I think it's great. I grant I was grandma finding husky.

39
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:20,760
Nice weather this weekend, and it was so much fun. So maybe I'll pop the picture up there, but something you're thankful for?

40
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:27,450
Yeah. Friends of friends show up and thanks for everything.

41
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:30,850
I love that you have very honest.

42
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:40,470
Close friends and family, but specifically to see my dog next week in the dog name of dog, you type of dog, I should say.

43
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,969
I am very good. I see a lot of people I'm thankful to.

44
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:52,770
My dog name's Daisy. She's half corgi, half Australian, but she's six years old and she's just great.

45
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,530
Okay, I understand that this week. I'm excited to just have a break.

46
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:04,140
Thankful to have a break. Are you okay? I see that.

47
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:09,350
Family, family, family.

48
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:21,510
Just think. I was so excited to see what you're thankful too.

49
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:27,570
That all my needs are met. All your needs are met. Maslow's needs are going on and you got it as William Stephen.

50
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:31,470
Sunrises and sunsets. Sunrises and sunsets.

51
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:40,680
All right. That corner and friends and family go for.

52
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:48,310
Friends and families like this. So thankful for life.

53
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:52,510
It's so nice to be with my dog.

54
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:58,120
It's kind of dog. It's a boxer full of boxer bulls dog.

55
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:07,630
Okay. I was here because of my feeling a little bit smaller and the snow was very good.

56
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:14,709
Awesome, awesome. While I am, I truly resonate with multiple things that you all have said.

57
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:21,160
Anderson has said friends and family as well on the screen joining you today.

58
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:31,570
And I think I would I'd ask to actually also same length itself just to talk about what I'm just thankful for.

59
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:39,940
Right. You stopped sharing that presentation.

60
00:06:52,590 --> 00:07:03,360
Thumbs up on a handshake screen. And.

61
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:22,170
Glad to see a thank you. Your friends. Anybody get a chance to see President Obama's speech next week?

62
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:27,430
Great reporting. Setting his agenda during council.

63
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:35,920
Talk about health and well-being. So I know the university will be engaged in a lot of talk being efforts going forward.

64
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:40,050
You know, a lot of great school of public health representation involved there.

65
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:51,730
If chance listen to the reporting, I need to hear specific improvements from some.

66
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:30,550
All right. Before I go on break on leave you with human resource management practices for quality and patient safety.

67
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:37,090
And we started the class with human resource strategies.

68
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:45,310
I have a slide that represents that as far as putting framework for what we started with in the very first class and

69
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:52,780
what I'm talking about today specific to quality and patient safety with the lens of human resources practices.

70
00:08:53,110 --> 00:09:01,480
So we are looking to learning objectives to describe the history of quality improvement and its role in health care.

71
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,580
Some of that will be a little bit of a refresher.

72
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:08,979
We've been in public health, so probably have had a lot of information around quality and quality improvement.

73
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:16,180
But it's important to set the context, understand the value of quality improvement methods, including key features and tools,

74
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:22,180
discuss human resource management considerations for implementing and sustaining quality improvement efforts.

75
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:32,380
Explain how team effectiveness contributes to quality improvement success, and describe the role.

76
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:42,490
What I would consider Main is improving and maintaining team effectiveness and sort of what will ultimately be your role.

77
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:55,210
So when we started, you would have seen this slide before regarding what is a human resource management system, what does it look like strategically?

78
00:09:55,810 --> 00:10:02,550
What are we what are we talking about? Right. We know that it's labor intensive, but basically trying to formulate h.r.

79
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,770
Strategies that reinforce the organization's business strategy.

80
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:16,420
Looking at the comprehensive set of managerial activities and then adopting strategic perspectives and recognizing critical linkages.

81
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:22,450
But again, as as we've noted before, the goal is to increase the probability that competent personnel will be available

82
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:26,680
to appropriately provide and perform services required by an organization.

83
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:37,090
So when we're thinking about sort of the system and the strategy and the approach and how we're trying to get individuals.

84
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:43,780
Sort of. Appropriately trained to provide the services.

85
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:51,810
A little bit of context about health care and quality before we move into what our focus is today,

86
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:58,080
that that'll help us to think about health care systems abroad.

87
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:04,140
Yeah. Her husband said he can't see the screening, screening and screening.

88
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:10,940
Thank you kindly. I think for.

89
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:19,070
Thank you. Thumbs up.

90
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:23,500
Okay. Thank you. Appreciate. Sometimes.

91
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:40,219
Given that health care systems are broad and scope with people, providers, ambulatory, I mean,

92
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:46,460
it's just from the the building blocks of the facilities and the systems to the people that work within those building blocks in the system.

93
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:54,230
The quality, output and patient safety, as we know will affect costs.

94
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,530
And patient and employee satisfaction.

95
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:08,590
That's just sort of a general statement of of what we believe about health care systems as they try to provide services.

96
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:12,180
But. Throughout the class.

97
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:19,860
We've also I've also tried to show that quality can be linked to financial incentives as we backed into like physician compensation and different

98
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:29,580
ways in which we think we can design a system to be effective for either over underutilization or looking at compensation in that regard,

99
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:35,520
but in a different way quality being linked to financial incentives.

100
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:42,989
When we take a step back and we think about Medicare Part B, and that's the physician quality reporting system,

101
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:47,819
which actually imposes a negative payment adjustment on practices that do not

102
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,940
provide sufficient information on quality measures for services coverage.

103
00:12:51,300 --> 00:13:00,870
So the point being here and the ACOs and Medicare and Medicaid that are also up here is just basically stating that we have some levers.

104
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:12,460
There is an environment where. We really want to ensure that when we look at quality, we are measuring it.

105
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:18,500
We're trying to put in the right rules and regulations to encourage it, to incentivize it.

106
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:23,930
And from a high level in our federal government, you've got Medicare partly trying to do that,

107
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:29,840
the accountable care organizations trying to reduce unnecessary care and medical errors while encouraging quality.

108
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:33,920
They're putting in rules and regulations again, Medicare and Medicaid,

109
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:41,840
the herb incentive programs that reward practices for implementing it, practices for continuous improvement at the point of care.

110
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:54,610
And again, it's all in the vein of what can we put in place that speaks to rules and regulations around quality that will produce an outcome?

111
00:13:54,860 --> 00:14:02,479
At what point in the system and what place what part of the continuing continuum can we have an impact?

112
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:11,900
And from a federal level, I call that here. Those are some options that can impact financial incentives if quality is done well.

113
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:26,270
The H.R. management system again speaks to more structure, infrastructure, the system that you need, the pieces of the system that you need.

114
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:32,510
But what we're going to try to focus on the day is the linkage of our practices and quality of care.

115
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:39,050
That's that's what that's the goal that we're looking for quality improvement.

116
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:44,720
So starting with quality improvement. I like this phrase.

117
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:49,969
It's basically primarily data and workforce engagement data being the basis for

118
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:55,820
design and engagement was really employing human capital to identify root causes.

119
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:03,880
And support the work to improve the situation. When we look at quality.

120
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:11,299
And then there's a question to be back there. It's it can be very measured.

121
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:20,240
It can be very metric, can be very data centered. But the attention is typically on the measurement, the.

122
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:26,870
We haven't had a balance to really look at the quality or the attention to the human side.

123
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:36,500
We haven't kept up to the quality around the humans that are involved in producing the quality results we want from an out care perspective.

124
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:43,849
And so we in human I include myself in human resources is sort of where my job is.

125
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:48,560
But we in human resources have to take a look back and think about are we preparing?

126
00:15:48,920 --> 00:16:02,150
Do we have the right measures and strategies in place to help the humans in the part of producing quality find them?

127
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:08,870
So the nice breakthrough was, what do you thankful for? I'm thankful for my family.

128
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:21,559
Awesome. And my family as well. So the focus again is it's different than the first class because that was really systems and procedures.

129
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:27,500
This is really more of the human the human resource practices and quality of care and quality.

130
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:33,320
So again, just a little bit of well,

131
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:40,040
a decent portion of history because I'm scoping this down for you as we think about

132
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:45,590
quality and scoping it down to giving you really what it looks like in human resources,

133
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:55,940
giving you a little bit of history of quality improvement and its role in healthcare quality improvement to definition from,

134
00:16:56,650 --> 00:17:07,670
let's say their names rightfully well told them and they think is the combined and unceasing efforts of everyone,

135
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:12,290
everyone's health care professionals, patients and their families,

136
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:21,229
researchers, payers, planners and educators to make the changes that will lead to better patient

137
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:29,330
outcomes or better system performance care and better professional development.

138
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:35,960
That's quality improvement. The process of quality improvement.

139
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:44,330
Looking at that particular statement, how do we arrive to that in 2007?

140
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:49,879
There's just sort of a historical timeline of when did we really start thinking about measuring quality?

141
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:54,050
When do we really start thinking about looking at the indicators?

142
00:17:54,050 --> 00:18:03,170
It was just about a long time ago. It's just a physician going into a house delivering care that I mean, 1752,

143
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:11,030
that was just a physician going in a house delivering care if they were physicians, if that was their title quality.

144
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:14,360
And what we talk about today wasn't an issue back then.

145
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:25,040
So when did we really start looking at a where we're really turning points when we look at the quality review continuum,

146
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:33,170
did we have those turning points? And in 1980, 1989, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality came into play.

147
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:37,490
In 1991, the Institute of Health Care Improvement and National Patient Safety.

148
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:41,630
Then after that, and then 1999, the IOM Institute of Medicine,

149
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:48,530
which is really been leading on a lot of the policy and regulatory changes and their definition,

150
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:55,280
which is a lot which is a little bit different than and I'm not going to call it that,

151
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:00,079
is the degree to which health services for individuals and populations increase the

152
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:05,990
likelihood of desired health outcomes and are consistent with the current professional.

153
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:17,830
So looking at those two definitions that are there, is there anything that really kind of jumps out at you?

154
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,629
Well, for me, you know,

155
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:32,110
I'm the first one is really it feels all inclusive and it specifically identifies who we're talking about in the I am I am definition is sort of less

156
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:42,759
specific but more about the health services for the individual and and what I consider the likelihood of increasing desired health outcomes for,

157
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:47,589
for them. It's sort of that's how it hits me going forward.

158
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:51,670
So getting a little bit of history about quality improvement, the timeline,

159
00:19:51,940 --> 00:20:00,130
those pivotal moments by which quality measurement came into play and why in your future world,

160
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:06,490
you will you will utilize a lot of methods for measuring quality.

161
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:10,720
But again, then talk a little bit about why that's important from a human resource management.

162
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:16,850
So. Again, a little bit more history.

163
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:22,760
The value of the quality, improvement in the methods and tools that we use.

164
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:32,390
So there was a need. So the timeline for those that got engaged from a health care perspective, we have a definition of quality improvement.

165
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:36,860
But what about quality, the work quality itself?

166
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:54,540
And I'm. Ask a judgment call when you walk into a restaurant and you think about the environmental factors that you're looking at.

167
00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:02,110
How do you know it's a quality restaurant? Going to create a following.

168
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:05,270
So you start off right before the door with that little thing in the window.

169
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:08,620
That's great. New York does that really well. Every piece visit.

170
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:12,020
Very, very significant. All right.

171
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:16,370
So you start with the greeting and you figure that goes with somebody somewhere,

172
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:20,120
had some regulations and reviewed it and audit it and gave it an A in that regard,

173
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:25,790
there are other other other factors you would think about online reviews.

174
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:29,720
Oh. Mm. Not Yelp but online reviews.

175
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:34,330
Right. Yelp do. Yeah. It's not something I feel like yield can be bias.

176
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:37,610
Yeah. That's why I was hesitating myself.

177
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:45,020
So I was in say that as well and maybe like a little bit of the service.

178
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:51,530
Like the customer service I feel like plays into a large role for higher quality like restaurants.

179
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:55,550
They typically have a better service.

180
00:21:56,060 --> 00:22:02,330
So people. Yeah, right. And one thing that kind of I don't think it's like a main thing,

181
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:07,340
but I think have been kind of I was like, you don't like the way it looks clean and there's a long way.

182
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,520
That's probably a good sign.

183
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:16,700
There's a lot of people waiting, the looks dirty and there's no way then you might want to rethink your choice right away.

184
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:22,399
Should be good or bad, right? Maybe they're understaffed or maybe they're they're prestigious of that highly recommended.

185
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,300
A lot of people are there lot like people like it think way like kind of you

186
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:29,420
have another indicator but might not be as much as some of the other ones.

187
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:34,790
Anything from this area, how do you know when you walk into a quality restaurant what hits you?

188
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:39,290
What it was first thing you think about, well, this is a great restaurant.

189
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:48,390
This can be nice. This is kind of specific, but like being like nice restaurants I've been to.

190
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:54,500
Like, they take your place as you finish eating while like so you go to a counter usually like the tables left,

191
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:58,010
like, like they don't pick up anything until you leave.

192
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:04,519
So, and I walk in a restaurant like, I see a lot of tables that, like, aren't busted or just seem messy.

193
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:08,000
Like, I would equate that to, like, a lesser quality restaurant. Okay.

194
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:18,240
Okay, great. Great answers. And, you know, it's my husband would say price that that's his determining factor if he's going to pay,

195
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:25,300
you know, $45 for, you know, something this small, he's he's like, okay, this better be this better test.

196
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:29,480
He's really good. I better stay on my mind for a while.

197
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:38,150
But but great answers. But I'm trying to get you at the macro level to think about your your measurements and criteria for quality.

198
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:43,489
And as you go into an organization, you're going to have that, that, that large view of things.

199
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:50,930
Where is that scoping, scoping down to the people and how that makes a difference as well.

200
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:57,800
And what are we doing with those individuals? But quality itself, defined by Institute of Medicine,

201
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:04,550
is the degree to which health services for individuals and populations increase the likelihood

202
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:09,260
of desired health outcomes and are consistent with current professional knowledge,

203
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:14,180
which you and I saw earlier. This again, this extends to patient safety.

204
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:28,230
And. Patient safety, then, is defined as the freedom from accidental or preventable injuries produced by medical care.

205
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:33,310
Do you agree? What do you think there's that could be possibly more to that?

206
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:43,150
Or does that sit with you as just a basic patient safety definition, freedom from accidental or preventable injuries produced by medical care?

207
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:56,090
One, two, three. No, I think it's more than just psychological safety for the patients.

208
00:24:56,310 --> 00:25:01,010
You know, when they receive hear me say that a little bit later for sure.

209
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:03,620
Yeah. Yeah. I agree with David.

210
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:13,250
I was going to add on to that psychological safety, but also like their experience in their encounter with every service they're getting as well,

211
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:21,620
depending upon the continued education of medical professionals and tend to

212
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:29,030
think when I read that I you walk in and you've got you thinking of quality.

213
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:33,799
You definitely when you walk into a physician's office for some type of service,

214
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,890
you definitely want to come out with what you think you're going to receive.

215
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:41,059
But what do you think about the quality around that? You definitely want it.

216
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:49,730
Don't want to come up with an injury, but imagine the receptionist was not as friendly as she needs to be.

217
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:55,820
You had 15 folks to get your blood.

218
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:00,170
Physician didn't see you for an hour and a half.

219
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:17,420
You start to think about, well, I was safe, but but the quality around that safety is also in in question internal medicines, key characteristics.

220
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:22,490
When they're defining quality in quality improvement, is it safe?

221
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:27,160
Is it effective? Is it patient centered?

222
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:33,110
Is it timely? Is it efficient and is it equitable?

223
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:40,150
And just looking at those characteristics, when we think about quality in quality improvement,

224
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:45,100
I tend to tend to agree to those and you sort of go to different places and spaces in describing those,

225
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:49,809
but we had to just sort of put them into a characteristic that I think I would support.

226
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:53,800
I hope that they are continued.

227
00:26:54,940 --> 00:27:01,710
So. Many of you. How many have heard of seeking continuous quality improvement?

228
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:05,730
Special opinions? Just wondering.

229
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,620
Okay. Okay.

230
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:20,310
So a decent, decent portion can UI is continuing quality improvement and it's been around for a while where we systems, health care systems,

231
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:30,300
take a look at their processes and procedures and they utilize different structural methods to pare down an issue,

232
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:39,180
a concern, and take that from a team approach and look at, well, where are we today?

233
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:41,070
Where do we want to be tomorrow?

234
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:50,250
And how do we continually stay relevant and flexible with our resources and continually improve the quality of what we're doing.

235
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:55,380
And so when we think about. Quality improvement.

236
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,410
When you think about the word quality, what is the approach?

237
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:07,270
Sikhism is an approach to getting the outcomes that you want from the services that you provide.

238
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:14,129
And so the approach of secure is the structured organizational process for involving personnel and planning and

239
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:21,870
executing a continuous flow of improvements to provide quality health care that meets or exceeds expectations.

240
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:36,449
That, again, continuous improvement is the structured organizational process for involving personnel is a key part involving personnel in

241
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:45,390
planning and executing a continuous flow of improvements to provide quality health care that meets or exceed expectations.

242
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:54,840
See, Huey tries to achieve the three goals that you see stated there true process improvement,

243
00:28:55,830 --> 00:29:00,930
gain competitive advantage and confirm a regulation and or requirement.

244
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:08,850
And so when we talked about AMD systems, I know we talked about human resource management and what they put in place.

245
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:13,650
They're trying to develop the appropriate personnel so that you can have a competitive advantage.

246
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:17,520
You can have a competitive advantage going forward.

247
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:22,860
But but you also have to think about the quality of the quality of what you're doing

248
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:30,240
and engaging with that human resource in order to gain that competitive advantage.

249
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:35,640
So tools and I'm curious to know how well this shows.

250
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:41,440
You can't just buy a I'll read them, but just by a show of hands.

251
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:47,490
How many people are familiar with total quality management? Okay.

252
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:52,000
Anybody familiar with MFI model for improvement?

253
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:57,600
Each received Six Sigma.

254
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:04,200
Pertinent or familiar interest. Lean.

255
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:10,280
I am personally LEED certified. I really kind of appreciate that approach.

256
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:16,250
And the reason why I kept saying interesting is titled Quality Management.

257
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:21,650
We started coming out in the eighties, in the nineties.

258
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:30,170
It's, it's, it's starting to become what SIKUA is, which is more of an approach rather than a methodology.

259
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:38,690
The screen is so small that I'm going to use this to make sure that I read what they are for you.

260
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:45,979
Okay. So total quality management draws on behavioral science, economic theory,

261
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:52,340
process analysis, and we may use qualitative and quantitative data to guide improvement.

262
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:59,710
Sounds very scientific. Leaving out what I consider a lot of the humanistic aspects, it's data data.

263
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:06,140
Data driven model for improvement consists of three fundamental questions.

264
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:16,010
What are we trying to accomplish? How will we know whether change in an improvement has occurred?

265
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:21,850
And what changes can we make that will result in an improvement?

266
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:28,000
And that MFI is really more like a PDK.

267
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:32,859
PDK is plan. Do check at your you're familiar with the PDK.

268
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:36,580
So my MFI is is is pretty much that particular approach.

269
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:43,360
I like this approach because it feels nonlinear to me.

270
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,740
It feels inclusive of data and inclusive of other things.

271
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:54,489
And then Six Sigma takes TQM total quality management principles with adding goals and

272
00:31:54,490 --> 00:32:00,639
identifying and eliminating the causes of errors and minimizing very variation in processes.

273
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,940
So again, very linear, seems very scientific,

274
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:08,110
boiling it down to the data and what's going to drive you and how you're going to how you're

275
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:13,450
going to sort of get to your outcomes and sort of what I consider that linear fashion lead,

276
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:24,400
which I've really embraced and as I said, Lean Certified is based on five principles that encourage continuous improvement through waste reduction,

277
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:34,570
includes customer perspective, value, streams, the flow and basically trying to pull to perfection meaning.

278
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,420
It's not trying to be perfect, but it's trying to have.

279
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:46,350
A process where you have the same outcome every time.

280
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:51,980
And that what you're looking at, even in that outcome and in that process is quality.

281
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:56,270
And so the end product quality on a rotational basis.

282
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:08,219
As an example, we used the lean approach working with an old chief health officer to really try to look at wait times,

283
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:11,400
really try to look at phone calls.

284
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:16,680
And if, you know, lean, you know, you're getting to the gemba, which is the root of something.

285
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:21,030
And then you're going to try to determine, you know, sort of there's some really cool mapping.

286
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:22,950
I kind of like the icons and the mapping,

287
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:29,730
but really trying to determine the flow of what happens in the breaks in the system that you're measuring along the way as you go.

288
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:35,360
But you're also begging the question of do we need to do this?

289
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:41,550
Is this quality? I think a good lean approach is a balance, a good quality improvement approach.

290
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:48,360
Methods to be used together are lean and because in the how are you guys doing.

291
00:33:49,140 --> 00:34:01,020
I called yeah very nice feel that in combining those two lean and MFI because it feels non it

292
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:09,510
feels somewhat linear but also nonlinear because you can ask some of those intuitive questions,

293
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:16,890
you can step back from the data. Sometimes the data can lead you to an outcome, but what are you really trying to come?

294
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:20,210
Are you getting to that accomplished effort that you put out?

295
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:25,350
So I like to to mix one or two. And these are methods.

296
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:38,110
You as you become leaders, you will look to the to your organization to determine what's kind of what are we trying to use around here?

297
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:42,090
You know, how we can make decisions, but what do we do about getting to quality outcomes?

298
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:50,940
What methods do we we use in our in our practices to really look at our practices and procedures going forward?

299
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:56,940
What I try to do here is really outline the commonalities of all of these.

300
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:03,270
And anything we do, we're going to have to plan for it. We're going to have to know what it what it is we're trying to accomplish and plan for it.

301
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:09,060
At some point, time are going to have to coordinate and organize the key process that you're trying to get to.

302
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:13,709
And there's a commonality of sustaining change or gains.

303
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:22,290
You don't want to slide backwards. So you're again. PDK Making certain that you're not going backwards in your days is showing you that participation.

304
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:29,070
Getting down to scoping involving personnel and participation in know process.

305
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:34,140
You have a method, you have an approach, you understand why we're doing it because it shows us and it guides us,

306
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:38,969
data guides us and of course, measurement, because, you know, you want to know if you're successful or not.

307
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:44,790
But the key here today is is really more about involving personnel and participation

308
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:55,020
when thinking about human resource management with with the personnel that's engaged,

309
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:59,010
that what what is what are the critical roles?

310
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:01,440
How do I want to make sure that I'm saying this correctly?

311
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:09,989
The critical role of employee and teams employees frequently have the best insights into the

312
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:17,310
causes of problems and feasibility of alternative changes and interventions that sit with you.

313
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:28,410
So. You take your role after your fellowship and your new job and you've got some you're 2 to 3 years into your role and you've got some information.

314
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:35,420
Nobody comes to you and asks you, how do we improve? Nobody asks for your participation.

315
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:37,700
And no way, shape or form.

316
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:46,070
You hate you hearing about this new system that's coming, it's going it's going to impact the quality of service that you're providing.

317
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:54,179
You're engaged, but you have not. Been asked to participate and the consequences of not engaging an employee.

318
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:58,730
Is your knowledge lost that to your employee?

319
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:03,629
Your knowledge lost because you have an understanding.

320
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:11,250
You will have an understanding. Employees will have an understanding of how things work and don't work and the subsystems

321
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:17,100
that literally thrive because of what they're doing and the trickle down effect,

322
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:24,389
which is ultimately going to impact the quality. As an example, you will not know her,

323
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:31,500
but her name is Erika and she is retiring in January from this university and she's been around the university for 35 years.

324
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,580
Her role. Who's the executive?

325
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:43,550
Assistant to every president for the last 35 years.

326
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:55,020
And. I've often stated that you want to get somewhere with somebody who's a leadership, know their assistant.

327
00:37:56,180 --> 00:38:01,610
They know them better than they know themselves. And they can get you in and they can get you what you need.

328
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:05,660
Develop that relationship. Eric is leaving and there is a pattern.

329
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:13,820
There's this. There's quite a panic because a lot of what we produce from a quality perspective was her knowing exactly what to do,

330
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:19,040
who to hit, who to reach, who to, who to contact, who to, you know, get involved.

331
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,310
How to get these meetings together when you know, when to make things happen.

332
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:30,070
That's just one example. You know, and I keep asking, I need to know your consultancy to bring you back kind of deal.

333
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:38,100
But for the most part, we're losing someone and we're losing their knowledge and all of her information about how things work.

334
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:47,170
And now. We lose a physician, we lose a president every eight years.

335
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:53,300
He's got some knowledge and some information, but the system still runs because Erica is there making it run.

336
00:38:54,780 --> 00:39:00,480
For that president when they come in, they rely on her for that. Think about you've got a physician practice.

337
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:06,900
You've got your services that you are providing. We talked about Nancy versus the new nurse.

338
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:10,650
Nancy, the old nurse is leaving. We talked about that,

339
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:16,980
the knowledge lost and then what the new nurse would have to engage in in order

340
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:21,360
to get you to the level of quality of care that you used to under Nancy.

341
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:33,580
So it's important that we think about those personnel involved when we talk about quality improvement.

342
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:39,650
We want to further that to say.

343
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:51,290
When you're trying to look at a process from patient entry to patient exit in a visit,

344
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:56,840
and there's concerns with access times or wait times or, you know,

345
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:06,650
the physician schedule, we feel like we can pull this back and look at us because we don't feel like we're providing the best quality that we can.

346
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:10,990
Okay. Who's going to do that? Know you doing it all.

347
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:23,240
Are you going to ask anyone to engage with you so that you get the information so that you can properly assess that?

348
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:29,030
Is it is it a directive? Is it a relationship you built?

349
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:36,560
What does that look like? What does that feel like when you're when you're trying to produce something of quality?

350
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,240
And I'm going to go back to the restaurant.

351
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:48,780
And you said it's the person when they greet you, it's the person that served you, or they wait until they take the dishes.

352
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:53,970
Who trained them on that? How do they know that's quality?

353
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:57,750
I mean, I could just come and just, you know, they don't table turkey.

354
00:40:57,750 --> 00:41:04,320
Just pull the pull the tablecloth and you just get around all cleaned up.

355
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:09,090
I made space for the next person coming, but that's not quality.

356
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:14,910
How how do they understand? That's what they were supposed to do.

357
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:20,350
How do you. You would think that. Training is important.

358
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:25,810
Correct. But where does quality get introduced?

359
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:31,640
To the employee to say that's what you have to produce.

360
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:37,340
How do they know the medical system just goes to get their certification?

361
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,920
After time. Some of them don't even need certification.

362
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:53,930
Example, I do know I met with my colleagues last night that when we think about poses to you, when we think about giving immunizations.

363
00:41:56,510 --> 00:42:07,330
When immunizations became available. And they were widely spread hundreds of thousands of miles available to give shots in arms.

364
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:13,200
Did we think about the quality of the person giving the shot?

365
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:19,500
No, we didn't. Was that going to be a direct impact on the quality of care you received for your shot?

366
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:30,750
So we called in the military. We called in all types of personnel that were certified and not certified.

367
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:43,620
And I've heard a varying degree of peoples and the services that they received and how they either thought it went well or it was terrible.

368
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:56,190
They had blotches because the was it right wherever they stuck them and some nurses were excellent that were felt it issue but we had a multitude of

369
00:42:56,190 --> 00:43:06,780
people called in with varying degrees of skill and training to provide something that we thought was quality and going to give us a quality outcome.

370
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:15,320
So again. When you think about your staff that you're managing.

371
00:43:16,830 --> 00:43:21,930
That you're going to manage, that you yourself will be managed by someone above you.

372
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:30,570
What is it that drives you to deliver the best quality product that you can?

373
00:43:31,350 --> 00:43:36,620
You've got a process you're going to use. You're going to in a look at like I said, look at the wait times.

374
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:43,890
It's it's really looking at the human aspect, what they know, what they believe, how they're engaged,

375
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:53,820
how they're participating to understand, delivering that that quality outcome through a process, a quality improvement process.

376
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:57,390
But it's the human aspect behind them that's going to make it work.

377
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:07,070
Nurses. Nurses constantly in my mind really look at a lot of their quality procedures and what they do.

378
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:11,120
I do think and then in their schooling, in their training, in their teaching,

379
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:16,060
when they come to an organization, they feel that they're going to have the responsibility of a job.

380
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:19,940
But nobody tells them about their attitude. Nobody tells them about.

381
00:44:20,210 --> 00:44:24,670
How do they know the bedside manner? How do they know to give that palliative care?

382
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:29,810
Where does that come? Is that just the individual? Is it right to have the employer?

383
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:41,420
Think about surrounding that. And when we think about quality improvement.

384
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:51,300
Usually it's it's within teams. It's usually an either an individual in the process that you're doing or it will involve teams.

385
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:57,850
And again, I truly think of like a medical medical team, a physician, nurse, medical, those.

386
00:44:57,870 --> 00:45:02,070
Then they're all looking at case management, what they can do and how they can be effective.

387
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:15,170
But from an H.R. perspective, when we look at how teams or an individual can be effective and what contributes to that?

388
00:45:17,930 --> 00:45:27,379
When we look at the our practices, you see the job design and job descriptions up there that we've talked about in this particular

389
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:35,480
class when we're looking at quality controls that we should consider from an H.R. perspective that

390
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:41,360
could help the employee actually deliver the best quality that they can when they're working

391
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:47,510
through a quality improvement or quality improvement process for job descriptions and job designs.

392
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:52,790
Question to be asked Is quality addressed in the job description?

393
00:45:54,560 --> 00:46:02,630
Do we talk about? We are a continuously improvement organization and we would like for you to join us.

394
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:08,150
Do you start from the beginning? What do you say in your interview?

395
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:17,660
Have you in your fellowship interviews, had any type of question about what they're doing for their quality and what quality means to them?

396
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:22,880
Have you seen it in their mission vision alignment?

397
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:30,110
Like, Are you being tied to a quality statement in any way?

398
00:46:31,070 --> 00:46:38,090
And so just by a show of hands, how many people have heard quality in their interviews, in the material,

399
00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:47,840
the word quality, quality improvement just by a show of hands might find these six individuals interesting.

400
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:57,050
There's lots of employers out there. You're you guys are applying in multiple places and spaces and it's the expectation of quality.

401
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:02,840
Has it been given to you at that leadership level in bringing you in?

402
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:12,230
Will you repeat that behavior when you're in that organization and not share that with the employees that you're hiring?

403
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:19,970
I it's so important. First impressions are everything to a degree.

404
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:28,819
So why would you not talk about this as a quality organization and have a definition for what that means for the employer,

405
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:32,900
that you are working for an employee or that you want to work for you?

406
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:38,780
Because when you bring up a quality improvement process, they are already aligned.

407
00:47:38,790 --> 00:47:42,109
What you need, what happens? You need to get it and get it.

408
00:47:42,110 --> 00:47:49,790
Come on. Okay. So from an H.R. perspective, one, take a step back and Howard scoping this down.

409
00:47:50,810 --> 00:47:54,410
Yes. There was a need for quality improvement.

410
00:47:55,010 --> 00:47:58,549
Need to define quality. But at the same time,

411
00:47:58,550 --> 00:48:08,240
we have processes and methods and we looked on the outside of our systems without looking at the inside of our systems and asking them to

412
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:15,960
join us in that particular effort and making and stating it clear some human resource perspective that that's sort of what we're getting to.

413
00:48:16,550 --> 00:48:24,650
Employee recruitment and selection. Do the applicants know that participation in activities is a key requirement?

414
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:33,200
Does the organization have a valid method of assessing assessing quality related competencies in job applicants?

415
00:48:36,130 --> 00:48:39,460
Communication, culture and inclusion.

416
00:48:41,870 --> 00:48:49,130
Is the organization sufficiently flexible to support open lines of communication both vertically and horizontally?

417
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:56,230
Do employees feel as if it's safe to express their views?

418
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:04,450
So if you're asking employees to be engaged, saying, we want your feedback, we want to know, here's a survey.

419
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:08,380
We have 51,000 staff here. We send out a survey.

420
00:49:08,590 --> 00:49:13,120
We want your thoughts. That's great. That is one way to get feedback and information.

421
00:49:13,330 --> 00:49:18,159
But when you at the grassroots ground level of operations in Michigan,

422
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:28,050
medicine or on campus and you're trying to gain gain insight in how to improve an option, it's going to be more of an intimate team that's working on.

423
00:49:28,330 --> 00:49:30,610
And how do you how do you engage that?

424
00:49:30,610 --> 00:49:38,110
And how do you have someone who is you've got a physician in the room, the nurse in the room, and then you've got the janitor in the room.

425
00:49:38,410 --> 00:49:44,020
Will the janitor feel comfortable enough to talk about that quality improvement

426
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:49,450
process and feel as if they can override what the physician is thinking?

427
00:49:51,970 --> 00:49:55,480
How many times you think that happens? I can tell you it happens a lot.

428
00:49:55,960 --> 00:50:00,350
You may be the very person in that room who says you.

429
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:06,940
Quality is what we're looking for here, and we're going have all different perspectives that need to come to the table.

430
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:12,670
So it's really important that we hear everybody's voice. There's no one left out of the system.

431
00:50:13,090 --> 00:50:16,680
So, you know, we appreciate hearing from everyone.

432
00:50:16,690 --> 00:50:22,870
So start the tone off right there. But if you have it in the job description and everybody came into the organization knowing that

433
00:50:22,870 --> 00:50:26,530
quality was important and they're going to be involved in quality changes and quality improvement,

434
00:50:26,770 --> 00:50:29,440
when the team finally sits down and they talk about quality,

435
00:50:29,650 --> 00:50:39,640
the janitors should feel just as important as a physician, but it oftentimes will be up to you to set that tone.

436
00:50:40,810 --> 00:50:48,880
One of the things and tools that I utilize in setting and making certain that they are, that's the psychological safety I think we talked about.

437
00:50:49,210 --> 00:50:52,690
I'm not sure if that's expressly here, but I think I have it on another slide.

438
00:50:55,140 --> 00:51:01,170
When I'm in a room with a baby, in a room with multiple people with multiple degrees.

439
00:51:01,630 --> 00:51:05,430
Matter of fact, CDC called today. 50 people on the call.

440
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:11,130
The one thing we do, titles are off the table. Titles are off the table.

441
00:51:11,370 --> 00:51:14,420
We need to make certain that everybody can communicate.

442
00:51:14,430 --> 00:51:18,070
We need to hear everybody's voice expressing their views.

443
00:51:18,090 --> 00:51:24,959
How are you going to create culture as a leader to engage your personnel to do quality improvement?

444
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:29,250
And how are you going to support the communications that's necessarily needed?

445
00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:33,570
Will you speak up or will you just let the tone and the culture and the climate exist?

446
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:37,919
Will you be one of the leaders or will you just let it slide?

447
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,330
Because this is how this place works.

448
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:50,100
That's that's rubber meets world of who you will be in making certain that the organization can improve or not through.

449
00:51:50,370 --> 00:51:52,559
You'll have it. You'll have a scientific system to use.

450
00:51:52,560 --> 00:52:00,299
But if you can't get the the environment for people to express their views and how to make things better,

451
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:04,470
and you haven't asked them or you yourself haven't been asking you yourself won't speak up.

452
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:25,309
Okay. That's hostile to. Is teamwork, an accepted means of getting the work done, everybody in their silos and they do their own thing.

453
00:52:25,310 --> 00:52:29,430
What do you want? Teamwork. Do you want that to happen? Performance management.

454
00:52:29,450 --> 00:52:34,040
When you're looking at the employee and what they're doing is participation in the efforts.

455
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:38,500
A part of the employee performance appraisal. It's an option.

456
00:52:38,510 --> 00:52:42,620
It's an opportunity. It's something you should you should have for your employees.

457
00:52:43,710 --> 00:52:53,090
You wouldn't you want to know what's next level. They are your employees or you yourself can be the conduit to make change.

458
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:58,160
And so in looking at that, is it in your what would you want?

459
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:02,900
So at some point in time, you're going to be evaluated in your role and in your job.

460
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,390
How comfortable will you be?

461
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:16,450
On that performance management that says you help us with quality improvement and we want quality improvement to be a part of what you do.

462
00:53:17,170 --> 00:53:24,070
Does that feel welcoming? Does it feel old? Does it feel open to feel like they care to hear what you have to say?

463
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:28,840
But if it's not there, what does that mean?

464
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:36,090
If it's not there? You can kind of scapegoat and get away from it.

465
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:40,770
I ask for it all the time. How am I helping the organization?

466
00:53:41,370 --> 00:53:46,300
How do I make blue go? You've heard that. My job.

467
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:51,100
And that monster came from Tim Kennedy years ago.

468
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:57,400
And that basically stated the level that he was working at, that the university was not a high level position.

469
00:53:57,730 --> 00:54:01,270
But he said, you know what, we make blue go in.

470
00:54:01,270 --> 00:54:06,700
Let me say this a little bit differently. I have heard leaders say I can walk out of this university and there is no impact.

471
00:54:07,390 --> 00:54:10,870
But you let the janitors leave. There is an impact.

472
00:54:11,350 --> 00:54:15,130
The bathrooms, the quality of this place starts to erode.

473
00:54:15,430 --> 00:54:25,000
Right. So, again, where are you putting this in that employees performance management plan your own performance management plan.

474
00:54:25,030 --> 00:54:30,820
Think about that as an option. Something you can bring forth, something that will be unique and different when you go forward.

475
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:39,400
Reward systems do. Reward systems take into consideration an employee's effectiveness as a team member and contributor to the UI efforts.

476
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:50,649
But you want to reward people who have engaged in quality improvement process or is it just a part of their job?

477
00:54:50,650 --> 00:54:56,610
And that's what we expect. What is the incentive? Just to say you're doing it and it's on your resume.

478
00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:00,570
And and how do you reward somebody with an improvement?

479
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:05,550
Now, quality and patient safety impact cost.

480
00:55:05,570 --> 00:55:12,180
So if we improve the patient safety and the quality of care, hopefully we're finding some efficiencies.

481
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:17,700
Maybe there's some budget dollars gain and maybe there's a raise that we can that we can get out of that.

482
00:55:17,910 --> 00:55:21,870
But again, you've just gone through a Lean Six Sigma process,

483
00:55:21,870 --> 00:55:30,000
and it took a year to be able to implement the team's approach to this or 15 people on it.

484
00:55:30,630 --> 00:55:34,410
And then you just kind of go away. That's it.

485
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:39,060
You didn't reward them for you know, was it acknowledged somewhere?

486
00:55:39,070 --> 00:55:43,649
Did you give them a gift card? You know, because that's a quality statement.

487
00:55:43,650 --> 00:55:53,700
Back to I. So the old school of thought of this is grandma sent.

488
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:58,670
$25 in the birthday card to you.

489
00:55:59,930 --> 00:56:05,090
And your mom says, did you send a thank you back, grandma?

490
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:09,080
Anybody ever go through that? Yeah. Okay.

491
00:56:09,530 --> 00:56:16,130
So what is was mom trying to say to grandma that this is what we do because this is what we do to care.

492
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:20,360
This is the quality, this this type of quality process we have.

493
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:26,330
We we show that we give in return. Exactly.

494
00:56:26,870 --> 00:56:31,580
You know, something as as a reward to say thank you for sending the money.

495
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:36,250
It's it is a reward to grandma. It is a reward to grandma.

496
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:39,519
I will never forget my mother telling me that a thousand times.

497
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:47,020
Did you send a card today? Yes, I did. Going forward, it's our reward system training.

498
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:52,000
So this is the part I was getting at from the restaurant perspective.

499
00:56:53,200 --> 00:57:04,870
Do employees receive training that is directly applicable to the organization's methodology methodologies such as teamwork and measurement?

500
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:10,420
Has anybody heard of Zingerman's onboarding orientation?

501
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:16,630
Has anybody heard of Disney's on board orientation and induction?

502
00:57:18,390 --> 00:57:27,180
Okay. All right. So in that approach, from a training perspective, Disney employees, so they need to share that.

503
00:57:27,260 --> 00:57:31,680
I went down to learn Disney's approach to quality health care years ago.

504
00:57:31,770 --> 00:57:34,860
Great conference. If you ever get a chance to do it, they're still doing it.

505
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:46,709
Absolutely fantastic. But what we learned was Disney will not release any of their employees for anywhere from 14 days to 30 days,

506
00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:52,080
depending on the job that they're doing to train them in the quality of what they want.

507
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:56,610
And their quality measurement is safety.

508
00:57:57,240 --> 00:58:01,050
You would think it's fun, but it's not. It is safety.

509
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:05,070
And it was just mind blowing.

510
00:58:05,070 --> 00:58:09,360
And now you've got a nurse that you just hired. Can you keep her off the floor for two weeks?

511
00:58:10,650 --> 00:58:16,840
Oh, no. Zingerman's actually goes through a process.

512
00:58:17,770 --> 00:58:23,050
You're offsite for a while. You're learning their mission, their vision, their goals.

513
00:58:23,290 --> 00:58:30,880
And you're learning about why they care, why it's so important that the product we produce, you're just you're soaking up all.

514
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:36,370
Some people will call it the Zingerman's Kool-Aid, but you're soaking up all of who they are.

515
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:49,180
And then they go through a training that you shatter and you shadow the best model practiced, and you get a chance to understand,

516
00:58:50,230 --> 00:59:01,240
wow, every customer smiled here because the person smiled back and but that person was trained that that is what happens.

517
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:05,830
So when you hire your employees, you're like, go ahead, do your job.

518
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:11,800
How did you engage? How how did what is it that you can do to train?

519
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:15,220
Where can you train? How can you put that forward?

520
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:20,379
That this is what we are and this is what we do? Does the organization have that for you already done.

521
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:23,050
And when they get on your floor, you're going to be the recipient of that.

522
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:31,420
But where does the training occur in the restaurant when they the hostess receives you with a smile, it feels good.

523
00:59:31,750 --> 00:59:39,219
It feels like it's going to be a quality experience. You sit down and how are you this afternoon, ma'am and sir and all that?

524
00:59:39,220 --> 00:59:43,360
I'm now in but you get that is great.

525
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:52,720
Food comes out hat ready and capable and this is getting better and water filled and you know so you've got the great a.

526
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:57,959
You've got a couple of other criteria by which you would say is quality,

527
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:06,330
but you keep getting these little nuggets of quality pieces to say this is a quality experience, but how did that come to be?

528
01:00:07,050 --> 01:00:09,840
How do you got a better question? How did that come to be?

529
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:16,860
How did that that person know that this was capable and who's telling them and who's holding them accountable?

530
01:00:16,860 --> 01:00:24,410
And where does that belong and what does that look like? Management style organizational structure again, will you?

531
01:00:24,740 --> 01:00:28,940
This is when we started the class. I talked about the arts and science.

532
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:33,530
You got the science and the tools and the processes that you can use to do that.

533
01:00:34,010 --> 01:00:38,810
But the arts is your style.

534
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:48,800
Do you model do you model that because you are going to look to you for when we look at the tone and culture of the university.

535
01:00:49,130 --> 01:00:54,650
We look at Mary Sue Coleman, Mark Schlissel and President Boneham from three different styles.

536
01:00:54,860 --> 01:01:03,410
What will they model? To produce a quality University of Michigan experience for the students and the staff that are here.

537
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:11,690
What does that look like? From our perspective, these are the things that we have to take into account in our systems.

538
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:17,090
Does the organization employ Q II methodologies to improve the organization?

539
01:01:17,660 --> 01:01:20,720
So I do know Jack.

540
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:29,270
Dr. Jack. Billy, is anybody familiar? He's retired. He led the effort over the last, I would say,

541
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:38,540
10 to 12 years of the lean through the College of Engineering and making research in as many people as he could get recruited to work through Lean,

542
01:01:39,110 --> 01:01:43,610
which was the process. And the University of Michigan supports it.

543
01:01:43,820 --> 01:01:48,250
We support Six Sigma. We support having the lean approach.

544
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:52,160
We are we support TQM, we support PDK.

545
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:55,520
For those that are staying in a fellowship with U of M,

546
01:01:55,520 --> 01:02:01,610
I'm pretty sure you probably heard some of this information, but if you're going elsewhere, ask the organization.

547
01:02:01,620 --> 01:02:09,950
Like I said, if you haven't even heard it in your interviewing and you're going into a space to be asked to make improvement,

548
01:02:10,220 --> 01:02:14,990
quality improvement, but you're not sure how the your employer does it.

549
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:25,690
You're not insured. You're not sure what that looks like. Did it in any of your thoughts around human resources when you.

550
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:34,829
Get that transactional onboarding, ask that they should know your h.r.

551
01:02:34,830 --> 01:02:45,479
Systems shouldn't and it's something that you want to go ahead and tie yourself to and ask these questions for yourself and for the

552
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:54,330
staff that you will be managing because you're going to have to ask the personnel to get involved in quality improvement processes.

553
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:03,950
Where's. Where's the bass? Are you the lone champion out here looking, trying to make this happen?

554
01:03:07,420 --> 01:03:16,420
Failures? Well, there's opportunities to be successful when you're looking at quality improvement.

555
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:21,880
And if you don't provide the training, you don't make the awareness, it's going to be a hard road at home.

556
01:03:24,770 --> 01:03:28,100
And I talked about that before. Leadership will dominate the discussion.

557
01:03:29,150 --> 01:03:31,640
They think they know. They think they know.

558
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:40,300
I tend to think of the Beaumont Spectrum merger, and there's going to be some processes that will have to change.

559
01:03:40,330 --> 01:03:45,639
There's going to be some quality improvement processes that will change. Who will do those things?

560
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:49,670
Will that just be leadership? Who signed the agreement deal or will they pull together teams?

561
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:53,739
Will they pull together individuals? And how do those teams know that they're going to be pulled?

562
01:03:53,740 --> 01:03:56,860
And what does that look like? What are we asking of them?

563
01:03:59,490 --> 01:04:08,760
Not sharing the information. You have employees that are willing and ready to engage and you train them, but they're not giving any data.

564
01:04:09,330 --> 01:04:18,719
So then how do they know exactly what they're supposed to be accomplishing if they can't look at the data and she and someone

565
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:25,920
in some office has some information that they're protecting in their silo and if it's needed to help improve the process.

566
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:33,180
But there's no relationship to get that data, to get that information, to help put that in the process to to move the process forward.

567
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:41,309
There's no support of resources. Just get it done. Just get it done.

568
01:04:41,310 --> 01:04:44,879
We don't have any money. And we thought we can't figure it out.

569
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:47,940
We're leaving plenty of money behind this. Just just get it done. Just come up with.

570
01:04:48,420 --> 01:04:51,790
Tell me what you can do. And time.

571
01:04:53,290 --> 01:04:55,149
Whether they're giving you one week,

572
01:04:55,150 --> 01:05:03,130
are you going to speak up because you've been given two days to deliver something and you know you need seven days?

573
01:05:03,670 --> 01:05:10,570
What quality outcome can you possibly deliver in two days when you know it's going to take you seven days to do it?

574
01:05:11,990 --> 01:05:15,650
Are you imposing those on your employees?

575
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:18,770
When you ask Is it being imposed on you?

576
01:05:19,430 --> 01:05:26,510
What timeline do you have to deliver this to make certain that those are involved at the time to give you what you need?

577
01:05:28,620 --> 01:05:34,859
Um, so when you, when you're thinking about quality improvement and we tend to think of that in terms of teams,

578
01:05:34,860 --> 01:05:39,780
as I said before, what are, what are factors in team effectiveness, right?

579
01:05:41,310 --> 01:05:44,700
The team makeup and the team member characteristics.

580
01:05:45,180 --> 01:05:48,210
We're talking about size. Are they empowered?

581
01:05:48,690 --> 01:05:53,310
Are they supported? Is the culture supportive internally and the training, which I talked about.

582
01:05:53,820 --> 01:06:00,760
But when. We are three men.

583
01:06:00,810 --> 01:06:04,470
About three years. Two and a half into culvert work.

584
01:06:04,890 --> 01:06:16,610
And we're thinking in terms of the team composition and how can we improve expanding COVID to other infectious disease and other immunization needs?

585
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:20,700
And we're looking at the composition of who needs to be on the team.

586
01:06:22,260 --> 01:06:33,270
Campus Health Response Committee was set up for two years, but then it went from a team of 18 to a team of 35.

587
01:06:33,930 --> 01:06:41,549
We expanded it to get additional expertise, to get those members who could give us additional information to look at our processes

588
01:06:41,550 --> 01:06:45,840
and how we were using a method to improve our our thoughts and complement it.

589
01:06:46,230 --> 01:06:55,320
They shared their information. And now we're on this rotation of looking at how can we improve the quality of work going forward?

590
01:06:55,830 --> 01:07:01,709
What does that look like? Getting those engaged, we shared with them their charge, what was going to be happening,

591
01:07:01,710 --> 01:07:08,580
what we would be expecting of them getting them engaged and actually getting them involved in the quality improvement process.

592
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:19,110
We've empowered multiple individuals to go forward and find things that we need to be aware of from a data perspective and come back and let us know.

593
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:24,800
The second thing is leadership and team level factors. Who leads the team?

594
01:07:25,740 --> 01:07:29,059
Okay. Have you ever been on a team?

595
01:07:29,060 --> 01:07:37,670
And there's a person that you just kind of feel like could use a little bit more strength in project management or a little bit

596
01:07:37,670 --> 01:07:46,640
more leadership skills because you're not really staying on target to get to that quality outcome that you're looking for.

597
01:07:46,940 --> 01:07:50,880
It's important if you are assigned, what is your role?

598
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:55,700
If you have staff that's out, that will be on a team that's doing quality improvement.

599
01:07:55,700 --> 01:08:07,390
Who's leading that team? I would just go on to basically state that the janitors should not lead surgical improvement.

600
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:17,380
For the physician. I mean, that's just the obvious. The cook should not lead improvement in how the hostess.

601
01:08:18,430 --> 01:08:26,560
Can do a better job in welcoming who's leading the team that knows the most to get us to the best quality outcome.

602
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:30,760
Are they engaged to do that? Are they trained enough to do that?

603
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:39,370
Who's who's competent enough in that particular team to create the psychological safety?

604
01:08:42,740 --> 01:08:48,080
You will be in a meeting and if you haven't seen it already.

605
01:08:50,730 --> 01:08:58,860
Where it it'll take one voice to just change the dynamics of a team trying to produce a quality outcome.

606
01:08:59,310 --> 01:09:04,590
Will you be that person? From human resource perspective, will you allow that from your staff?

607
01:09:06,140 --> 01:09:13,320
Well, I think I'm comfortable enough to say this, that don't be so in your feelings that you can't hear information from somebody else.

608
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:21,290
To just do something that's going to be the best quality outcome for you and your organization.

609
01:09:21,710 --> 01:09:28,070
Your title should not hold you back from listening to others who know what's going on.

610
01:09:28,820 --> 01:09:34,280
That's how you get to the bases of trying to have quality improvement because again, that that knowledge is important.

611
01:09:34,820 --> 01:09:39,260
And who's going to create that? Who's going to take that interpersonal risk to do that?

612
01:09:41,180 --> 01:09:47,209
Managing bottlenecks. And then third, the external team support.

613
01:09:47,210 --> 01:09:51,650
We talked about stakeholder support stakeholders and who they are and how they can support you.

614
01:09:51,650 --> 01:09:59,450
So when you're thinking. Again, these are the success factors in team effectiveness for using personnel,

615
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:04,630
getting engaged to get and use a quality improvement method to get to a quality outcome.

616
01:10:05,110 --> 01:10:14,950
Engaging and involving participants. It's important that we think about.

617
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:21,860
Looking at again the science portion of what we're doing.

618
01:10:22,310 --> 01:10:28,670
But if we can take a step back and look at the humans that are involved in those processes, you are one of them.

619
01:10:29,450 --> 01:10:33,530
How are you being treated? How are you treating others?

620
01:10:34,070 --> 01:10:44,629
Because if I if I have a personnel who's upset and they're leading a quality improvement team,

621
01:10:44,630 --> 01:10:54,080
am I going to get the best work out of that person to give me something that I then have to give to my boss and the organization is relying upon it.

622
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:59,180
How retreating? How are retraining? How how have we set the expectations?

623
01:10:59,510 --> 01:11:03,649
How have we looked at the human resource recruitment?

624
01:11:03,650 --> 01:11:10,460
Part of that retention part of it for that employee to say, this is this is this is what we're doing.

625
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:15,370
Health care talks a lot about. We need to improve. We need to improve.

626
01:11:15,380 --> 01:11:18,740
We need to improve. Health care is a term.

627
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:23,210
Health care is actually people who need.

628
01:11:23,810 --> 01:11:29,450
You can have a facility in the bed and the needles, but without the people.

629
01:11:30,170 --> 01:11:37,690
And then we're not going to invest in. Setting up the quality dynamic that we need.

630
01:11:38,380 --> 01:11:41,770
We're going to get a service, we're going to get something.

631
01:11:42,100 --> 01:11:48,940
Something is going to be for it's coming out. But what happens if you want to have quality improvement?

632
01:11:49,210 --> 01:11:54,280
It's not just the effort. It's not just the what do we want to accomplish?

633
01:11:55,350 --> 01:12:00,910
It's who's involved in that question to get you what you need from quality.

634
01:12:01,230 --> 01:12:05,220
So you do have human resource management systems, you have performance management.

635
01:12:05,610 --> 01:12:11,560
It's the stuff that we had before you got the business strategy, you've got the alignment, the well,

636
01:12:11,580 --> 01:12:18,240
we're talking about quality and patient safety and quality improvement and getting to where we need to be.

637
01:12:18,270 --> 01:12:21,570
Don't forget the humans behind that.

638
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:27,510
And how are you engaging them? And are you the leader or somebody else the leader of it?

639
01:12:28,290 --> 01:12:36,839
What is your stakeholder say? Will you be will you be the champion for total quality management improvement and where you are?

640
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:43,380
And when you're part of that system, where you're part of something and they're asking you, what are you questioning?

641
01:12:43,950 --> 01:12:51,209
Just the small piece that you can provide, or will you take a step back and say, I've got this piece to add,

642
01:12:51,210 --> 01:12:57,160
but I'm also concerned about and can we include X, Y and Z or I really feel like this is missing at the table?

643
01:12:57,160 --> 01:13:02,970
Or can we have a subcommittee to look at what you're asking for people to do the work,

644
01:13:04,290 --> 01:13:09,390
what expectation has been set for them to come in and help you and do that?

645
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:16,250
Right. I will leave you with assignment seven.

646
01:13:17,570 --> 01:13:24,920
Three pages. What quality improvement methods have you witnessed when you're extensions?

647
01:13:25,970 --> 01:13:32,030
Why is the success of quality improvement dependent on appropriate human resource management?

648
01:13:33,710 --> 01:13:37,800
These are questions you can answer in the three pages. You don't have to take each question at the community terms.

649
01:13:38,210 --> 01:13:46,760
Looking for more scope. Which practices do you see as most important in quality improvement efforts?

650
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:51,670
And based on this quote. Every system.

651
01:13:53,940 --> 01:13:58,980
Is perfectly designed to get the results it gets.

652
01:14:02,650 --> 01:14:06,470
And this is a little off, but it also makes me think.

653
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:13,740
Does anybody know the definition of insanity? Let me know that definition.

654
01:14:13,750 --> 01:14:19,170
What I do like that thing knowing something over and over again and expecting the same result.

655
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:25,970
Wow. And how many times did you witness that in the health care setting and be okay with it?

656
01:14:27,350 --> 01:14:32,120
Because it's perfectly designed to give you exactly that.

657
01:14:32,990 --> 01:14:39,320
And then everybody's going, what is happening? So you have to question that.

658
01:14:40,280 --> 01:14:43,910
So again, every system is perfectly designed to get the results it gets.

659
01:14:44,300 --> 01:14:47,600
How does this quote apply to human resource management?

660
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:56,040
There's some good bonds there. So watching every class over.

661
01:14:57,380 --> 01:15:02,690
A great Thanksgiving feast. Great to see you all.

662
01:15:02,900 --> 01:15:08,120
Stay warm. And I'd be remiss if I didn't say wash your hands.

663
01:15:09,170 --> 01:15:17,280
Trying to cover you. Stay home if you're sick. It's a public health message saying thank you, Jesus.

664
01:15:17,450 --> 01:15:21,170
Totally appreciate you being here.

665
01:15:24,330 --> 01:15:31,160
Oh, sorry. What are you doing about it?

666
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:55,020
I'm not good at that. So it's kind of like, oh, my God, I really don't have time.

667
01:15:56,850 --> 01:16:03,480
I know I'm not like that.

668
01:16:06,410 --> 01:16:10,740
But it could be like just like she said about anything.

669
01:16:11,670 --> 01:16:20,840
If she invited me and she wants to know what it is like to invite me either.

670
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:29,540
But he is also like, I'm sure, what do I know?

671
01:16:29,540 --> 01:16:40,440
Like it's going to be like a cheesy trip, like the timing and like, I'm not going inside.

672
01:16:41,020 --> 01:16:51,160
You know what so is, you know, I know.

673
01:16:52,310 --> 01:17:05,209
I could just tell you it's like every night because I don't think I would.

674
01:17:05,210 --> 01:17:08,840
I want to. I think I am.

675
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:14,450
But I wasn't trying to get I was I was thinking.

676
01:17:16,460 --> 01:17:28,390
So it's not like, oh, yeah, you know, nature's way of thinking out.

677
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:35,770
Like, there's a chance we have, but, my gosh, we're going to kill you.

678
01:17:36,650 --> 01:17:43,970
You've got. So he's got the super star. The answer is yes. We've got you know, you are the team.

679
01:17:44,030 --> 01:17:49,100
No, I'm not. Do you do you remember how people would say that's it?

680
01:17:49,510 --> 01:17:59,200
Because was that was involved in this quarantine?

681
01:17:59,270 --> 01:18:02,690
Is it just it's just like the final two.

682
01:18:03,710 --> 01:18:08,240
So it's like I four years he said, I know how it is.

683
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:17,210
Yeah. Every one of you. I wasn't raised in the same way because I just I'm just looking at some she's going

684
01:18:18,220 --> 01:18:33,770
been through a like I just want to look at it like and be like just happy to give me.

685
01:18:35,070 --> 01:18:47,930
And Michigan is still the spirit of who you are.

686
01:18:48,570 --> 01:18:56,120
Yeah, just give me a little canvas, basically, which has been very easy project for you to.

687
01:18:57,820 --> 01:19:02,300
Yeah, it's awesome. Why did you have another $10,000?

688
01:19:03,260 --> 01:19:08,020
God bless me. I love the fact time.

689
01:19:08,030 --> 01:19:11,719
And it's like I say, you know?

690
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:20,150
I know. Is everything all right?

691
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:25,910
So you talking talk about medicine.

692
01:19:26,590 --> 01:19:33,460
You know this. What is going on right now is that you need a different world.

693
01:19:35,180 --> 01:19:40,730
So you know, what I see is what is happening to me.

694
01:19:42,280 --> 01:19:45,470
And I wanna say is so again, it's about where you live.

695
01:19:47,390 --> 01:19:59,240
How are you? The little corner. And so I started off with all this talk of hope on the horizon, possibly.
