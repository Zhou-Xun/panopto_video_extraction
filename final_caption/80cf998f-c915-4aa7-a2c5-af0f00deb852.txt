1
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:09,630
All right. Started the recording. Are we waiting on one more word?

2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:26,920
Yeah. Sorry. Yeah.

3
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,610
Hi, I'm Alex. I'm Priyanka. I'm Anna.

4
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:36,250
And the name of the article is she was already battling cancer that she had to fight both letters.

5
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:39,460
So essentially, this article is about a 44 year old woman.

6
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:46,930
Her name is Jan Peters and she's from Rapid City, South Dakota, where she shares a three bedroom apartment with a friend.

7
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:55,719
In the article, she can be described as more of like a freak, free spirited person who never really planned to start a family or have children.

8
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:59,350
But in her late thirties, she decided that she wanted to do more for her adopted community.

9
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:04,780
So she decided to adopt two daughters and foster four other children.

10
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:08,890
One of her daughters, at one point in her life, had actually been homeless,

11
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:12,940
and her first two foster children were from the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation.

12
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:19,390
Unfortunately, in spring of 2020, she received news that she had been diagnosed with stage two breast cancer.

13
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:27,250
Within weeks of that diagnosis, she also received test results that confirmed that she was also at risk of ovarian cancer as well.

14
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:31,330
As we learned in this course, cancer treatment today can be very debilitating,

15
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:38,230
consisting of many rigorous procedures such as surgery infusions, chemo and radiation.

16
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:42,940
All this can be exhausting dream to a patient physically, emotionally, mentally.

17
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:49,780
And so Peter in the article talks about how this whole process for her was really scary.

18
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:55,420
She felt that the secure life that he had built for herself and her children was now crumbling.

19
00:01:55,420 --> 00:02:00,730
And she was mostly afraid of leaving them behind, especially because they've already lost so much of their young lives.

20
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:06,430
But while all these worries were building up in her mind, so were the endless medical bills.

21
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:12,040
In April, she said, she received a call from a collector saying that she owed $13,000.

22
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:16,210
But now she estimates that the medical debts exceed over $30,000.

23
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:24,089
So. Well, I'm sorry. So she just said that was more than $30,000 in debt for her cancer treatments.

24
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:27,239
And she owes this on top of what her terms are already covered.

25
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:32,250
So she has employee employer health care insurance, which is the most common form of health care insurance.

26
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:39,990
And so the average earning for one person in South Dakota is $51,723 a year.

27
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,170
So this means that one provider family, single parent family living in South Dakota like Jenny,

28
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:51,150
could owe more than half of their yearly salaries, medical bills, which is not a sustainable way to live.

29
00:02:53,280 --> 00:03:00,390
So she has this family and medical bills make it very hard for her friends and her children everything they want, but also everything they need.

30
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:07,320
So as the article stated, two thirds of adults who have had cancer or someone in their family have had cancer,

31
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:13,770
spouse kids have cut spending on food, clothing and other household necessities in order to pay their medical bills.

32
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,140
And a fourth of them have declared bankruptcy.

33
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:26,290
And what we know from what we've learned in this class, while generally declining, cancer incidence is high and 25% of the people are going around.

34
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:31,970
Who left cancer in this country. Which I thought was really interesting.

35
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:40,700
I did not know that. And then cancer patients who declare bankruptcy are also more likely to die than cancer patients who do not.

36
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:49,410
So this means that people with lower socioeconomic status were dying at a higher rate than patients of high socioeconomic status.

37
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:55,830
And the financial burden of cancer highlights most of the previously existing disparities President for the United States,

38
00:03:56,070 --> 00:04:03,840
especially the health care system. So I have this quote, the National Cancer Institute.

39
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,379
From the article,

40
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:10,920
the National Cancer Institute calculated the average cost of medical care and drugs tops $42,000 in the year following a cancer diagnosis.

41
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,550
I mean, some treatments can exceed $1,000,000 for more specialized cancers.

42
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:20,010
It said in the article that the U.S. health care system is set up for people to shop for care.

43
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,610
And it doesn't work very well with cancer because everything is expensive and you're getting treatments for the rest of your life.

44
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:34,260
Tests, treatments. You're never going to stop paying for it. And six out of ten adults with chronic conditions have had some kind of health care done.

45
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:42,450
So thinking about this on a larger scale, when thinking about cancer from a public health perspective,

46
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:47,400
it's important to consider the long term effects that cancer has on families, even outside of the medical perspective.

47
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:53,100
The article talks about how Jenny is just one of many cancer patients who struggle to pay the costs of cancer treatments.

48
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:58,440
And one in five patients actually have bills that are over $10,000 that need to be paid.

49
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:05,970
And these high costs actually deter cancer patients from coming back for follow up appointments to avoid incurring even more medical bills.

50
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:13,630
And despite some patients having private insurance, Medicare or Medicaid bills pile up to the point where patients are taking out loans multiple,

51
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:17,280
taking on multiple jobs, or even living in their cars just to afford care.

52
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:23,730
And what makes a situation unique from other forms of care for infectious diseases is the need for repeated appointments,

53
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:27,720
for chemo, surgery or follow up appointments after a cancer diagnosis.

54
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:32,459
This is this can go on for months and often years to ensure that the cancer is properly dealt

55
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:36,600
with and there's always a chance of recurrence of cancers which can lead to additional death.

56
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:40,740
And I just want to end with a quote from Jenny that was in the article that I think really

57
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:45,420
captures the dichotomy of having to choose between your health and intense financial burdens.

58
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:50,729
So Jenny said the debt collector told me that it had been my choice to get the surgery.

59
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:54,180
Petersen called and I said, Yeah, I guess I chose not to be done.

60
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:59,489
So overall, that summarizes how difficult this decision is for a lot of people have to

61
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:03,660
choose between basically just being alive and being able to pay their bills.

62
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:09,569
And we just thought this was really important to think about, especially because we're talking about cancer in a very medical sense.

63
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:12,870
But this kind of takes it on like a larger scale, day to day life.

64
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:21,520
Yeah, that's our presentation. Thank you. Anybody have any questions or comments?

65
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:27,700
I just think it's like really interesting how like, like it's one,

66
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:33,669
it's like the feels like going to the doctor and seeking treatment but like also think you're literally living out of your car.

67
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:39,010
Like, yeah, clearly you are getting like other and it like it kind of.

68
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,920
You don't have adequate funding situation and you're probably not getting. Correct.

69
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,260
Nutrients which is probably really essential to have have in your body like help fight this.

70
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:56,820
So it seems like if high quality food getting exercise, good sleep like all of those things are not happening.

71
00:06:57,030 --> 00:07:01,769
Yeah. So it's just like interesting how like it's like almost like the economic system is like,

72
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:05,280
against you, but then also like everything else is working against you.

73
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:09,530
I mean, people have done work on like chronic stress and cancer, too, right.

74
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:18,030
And so this idea that like living in a chronically stressed state because you you don't have financial stability or because you know,

75
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:25,580
you're experiencing discrimination or stigma, you know, those kinds of things are things that people have studied.

76
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:30,120
And so obviously, like, if you're so worried about paying your bills, you're you're very stressed out, right?

77
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:36,290
Like you're not in a good place with that. I think it's also so this is what people need when they say financial toxicity.

78
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:40,850
Right. Everybody's heard that term. And so this is a big area of concern for cancer survivorship.

79
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,079
And I think it's interesting,

80
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:47,239
some of you are interested in like health care distribution and probably know more about like health insurance than I do.

81
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:52,850
Mostly, I hate it and I didn't enjoy my class about it because I don't like actually dealing with that myself.

82
00:07:52,850 --> 00:08:00,620
I just want it to be easy, which it never is. But like, there's this whole thing in talking to physicians who treat cancer,

83
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:05,359
there's this whole thing where like you can have the same drug and you can give it.

84
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:14,089
I was like, I've chemo in the clinic or you can give it as a pill and it's covered under different parts of the health insurance,

85
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:19,850
like it's an inpatient procedure or something with this, but then it's a prescription with the pill, right.

86
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:26,660
And so you can actually, like most health insurance is will cover much more of an inpatient procedure than they will of a pill.

87
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:35,299
And so people can't get oral cancer medication without paying tons of money out of like thousands of dollars out-of-pocket for oral cancer medication.

88
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:41,030
And they may actually be different medications and the oral medication may be better for the patient, but they can't afford it.

89
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:46,700
And so they have to come in for this infusion therapy and stuff because of how it's covered by health insurance.

90
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:58,760
It's really kind of bonkers that that the decisions about what treatments people are receiving are more about how it's paid for than anything else.

91
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:07,129
And this one woman I know who who treats cancer patients, she was talking about how like they work really hard to find these coupons.

92
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:10,130
They have all these coupons that like the drug companies give them.

93
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:13,550
And so they'll like give these patients coupons so that they can afford them.

94
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:21,530
I mean, it's this ridiculous process of like cobbling together ways to help people get their drugs.

95
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:30,230
And they know that there are certain months where people will skip their meds because of how the rollover happens with coverage and like,

96
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:36,400
what do you call it? There's a certain amount that they cover and then you have to pay of that.

97
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:41,260
Yeah. Like half of it. But it's like a doctor does that.

98
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:44,350
Their deductibles. Yes, the prescription deductibles run out. Right.

99
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:50,860
And so that, you know, at some point in the year, like in the calendar year, they know that patients will stop taking their meds.

100
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:56,790
It's it's insane. It's totally insane. So yeah, huge, huge problems.

101
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:02,390
Also, any bullet collectors that you guys are talking about is like hospitals with like

102
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:07,240
so that which is like also another like messed up system that like if those bills.

103
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:12,420
Simply making money off something that they can't afford.

104
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:24,140
All right, so just. Well, it's sort of like trying to help the person, I think because person wants to make more money than the person.

105
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:29,580
That's like, aggressive. Like the language in the article. They're, like, really intense about it.

106
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:37,840
It's crazy. Yeah. Oh, that's all very depressing.

107
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,370
But that is a that is a major issue that people are working on. Right.

108
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:47,740
I mean, I think that's part of the you know, the the brokenness of our health care system that we are trying to fix.

109
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:51,850
But will you guys work that out? You know that.

110
00:10:54,830 --> 00:11:03,500
Good job, guys. That was an interesting one. Okay.

111
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:13,880
All right. So we were talking about where were we? Did anybody finish what I am recording?

112
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:20,390
I got a good start. Um, thank you for reminding me.

113
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:26,720
Okay, so. Were we done with the group work?

114
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:33,210
And we completely finished it through. Question. 500.

115
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:38,730
But we. But you guys finished? Were any groups still working? Okay.

116
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:46,800
So we had talked through. So yeah. So we had mentioned what the population attributable fraction was.

117
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,970
Right. And then we were going to talk about question five, is that correct. Yeah.

118
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:56,189
Okay. All right. So just to review the population attributable fraction,

119
00:11:56,190 --> 00:12:01,860
is this this statistic that essentially what you do is you're calculating what proportion

120
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:07,229
of a disease in this case cancer in the total population can be attributed to an exposure.

121
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:14,130
So like, remember those pie charts we had where we said like 30% of cancer was due to smoking, 30% was due to obesity, blah, blah, blah.

122
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:18,520
Those are population attributable fractions. Okay.

123
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:27,150
So this these are examples of things that you might have.

124
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:33,339
Created in your group. So what we had you do, I believe let me remind myself the question.

125
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:41,890
If I was you were going to hear and we were going to make maps for cancer causes, is that correct?

126
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:48,190
Okay. So cancer causes. What do you guys want me to pick?

127
00:12:50,090 --> 00:13:04,670
Infectious. So I think we looked at maps and we looked at rates and we wanted HPV and we were going to look at males and females separately.

128
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:09,559
Right. So this is males. And did I see the incidence rate or did I have.

129
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:13,490
You do. Oh, I had. You do not the incidence rate had you do the.

130
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:18,530
No, that is the wrong tab. I had you do the attributable fraction.

131
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:23,180
So this is the proportion of cancers in this place in males that are due to HPV.

132
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:43,040
So. What did you guys think of this? Let's just really quick change it to females and that is way darker red and a very different distribution.

133
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:47,560
Yeah, I think probably the darker red.

134
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:56,320
It has to do with the fact that. It is.

135
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:03,180
We want more. But there are fairings and they're a bit more rare than.

136
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,490
That is correct. Yes. So the most common cancer caused by HPV infection is cervical cancer.

137
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:14,080
Right. And so that's what's going on here. But you had your hand up.

138
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:19,130
Yeah, I just thought it was interesting. How? But even the lightest shade in the.

139
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:24,390
The percentage is still far higher than any of the percentages in the chart.

140
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:28,740
You have to look paying attention to that. That's absolutely true.

141
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:39,710
Because then you realize that this is just. The US looks bad in the other one with percentages still.

142
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:45,860
So you're right. So the orange here is the lowest category is zero to less than 1%.

143
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:55,200
And then if you go into the males. You are correct that this is you know, it's what's going on now that looks like the same.

144
00:14:55,200 --> 00:15:02,019
The scale is the same, actually. Oh.

145
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:05,499
Scale is threshold versus rank. Where are you looking at?

146
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:11,740
Rank, maybe. Okay.

147
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:17,590
I don't know. Oh. What happened? Why did that all change the the section?

148
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:23,299
Say that again. I see what he's saying. It's like in the corner.

149
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:26,420
Like. Like the percentages change here. Yeah. Okay.

150
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:31,840
So that's males. And then it doesn't actually make.

151
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:40,320
For Ranke It does. Okay. So it depends on how you scale it, right?

152
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:47,549
Threshold keeps the scale the same so that if you want to compare between the two, you can if you choose, right?

153
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:55,020
It will actually. So what it's doing with rank essentially is it's saying this is like the quartiles of the right.

154
00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:01,680
So you are correct that for females the quartiles are higher than for the males.

155
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:06,160
So if we go to males. It's much, much, much lower.

156
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:12,350
You're correct. But if you want to be able to directly compare, you can choose threshold and it will keep the cut points the same.

157
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:16,849
Yeah. Yeah. So that's a good thing to know kind of about the system, right?

158
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:19,100
That you think you can play with it. But you're absolutely right.

159
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:23,900
Your point is well taken that the the cervical cancer is a much bigger problem right now.

160
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:29,030
The proportion of cancers caused by each year much higher in women. And what is going on?

161
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:37,860
Why is the US so hard for men? This is the only reason.

162
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:43,460
But I think. Getting back to.

163
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,340
I think it's not an issue for them is.

164
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:54,600
So I would say that the U.S. probably has one of the highest HPV vaccination rates of any place worldwide in Europe.

165
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:59,430
You know, Europe and U.S. probably are kind of, you know, the developed countries that you think of.

166
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,350
And we're all kind of high.

167
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:08,940
So you are correct that people are less like the male vaccination rate is a bit lower, but it's actually just kind of low generally.

168
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:12,740
I will say that the conversation you have, my son has a lot of right.

169
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:19,500
And so I took him to the pediatrician for his visit and they were like, okay, well, let's have a conversation about the HPV vaccine.

170
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,060
Here's a pamphlet. It's really important. You know, it is for us to be.

171
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:31,200
But you know, that kind of thing, right? Expecting you to give them trouble for it because nobody wants to vaccinate their 11 year old kid.

172
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:35,190
Current study, right? They're like, oh, maybe we doesn't need that.

173
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:41,220
And you're like, Yes, but someday they will and they're not going to tell you when that is.

174
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:47,130
So let's do it now when we know that they don't need it right now, and then they'll be ready when they do.

175
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,670
So there's a lot of discussion about like provider patient interactions around the vaccine and how to kind of take the

176
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:59,790
conversation about the HPV vaccine out of the bedroom is the way they say it and make it about it's a cancer vaccine.

177
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,950
But I was like, I'm an epidemiologist. I've seen the surgical pictures for HPV related head and neck cancer.

178
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:10,950
You can put that away and you can just bring the needle in. And we're we will take all of the vaccines, all of them.

179
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:18,959
So let me ask you the question. But yeah, so that's kind of what's going on.

180
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:27,330
I saw him back. So we actually do not do screening for anything but cervical cancer.

181
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:30,660
So there's no screening for any of the HPV related cancers of men.

182
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:35,160
So actually what it is, is just in this country and in a lot of developed countries,

183
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:43,590
we've seen a real increase in oral HPV related HPV related cancers in the past 30 years.

184
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:51,140
And people have, you know, talked about why this is. And we think, you know, it's really it's really linked to sexual behavior.

185
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:58,860
Right. So we have the sexual revolution in the sixties. And since then we have seen, I guess, oral HPV infection increase.

186
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:05,760
And so men who are now in their 67 years were young in the sixties and they're starting to get oral.

187
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:12,670
So it's interesting. You can actually see. Differences.

188
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:16,780
This is where we run into trouble talking about global cancer as if it's one thing.

189
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:24,730
Right. We talk about cancer in the U.S. and while we definitely have a plethora of different cultures in our country,

190
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:28,530
more or less we're much more homogenous than the world. Right.

191
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:31,929
And so when you start talking about global cancer, it doesn't really make sense.

192
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:34,930
You actually have to look at each country individually for a lot of these things.

193
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,170
So people have done work. I think I mentioned this to a couple of groups.

194
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:46,870
People have done work with like altitude surveys and like social surveys about attitudes towards various sexual behaviors.

195
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:51,600
And there are places in the world where oral sex is not normal, right?

196
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:54,610
It's just not a thing that people engage in on a regular basis.

197
00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:03,310
And so those places tend to have lower oral HPV rates and therefore lower HPV cancer rates.

198
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:11,710
So you can actually put a map of these cancer rates to kind of the norms of sexual behavior in a culture.

199
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:16,100
It's interesting. So that's kind of what's going on.

200
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:18,170
Does anybody else have anything else they wanted to talk about here?

201
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:35,160
This is kind of a fun you know you can look at each oh, it's pillars green don't know what you know hepatitis B is a lot in Southeast Asia.

202
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:43,240
So it's interesting. I think to look at this kind of stuff and then you can go back and look in the here.

203
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:48,639
I've done one for excess BMI, right?

204
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:56,160
And so this is colon cancer, specifically a fraction of all colon cancer sexes among both sexes worldwide.

205
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,260
Colon cancer cases among both sexes worldwide.

206
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:03,070
And this is in 2012 attributable to excess body mass index by country.

207
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:09,190
Right. So you can see that kind of in the developed world, you see a lot more of it than in developing countries.

208
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:16,260
And this is all infectious agents together. And so you see a lot more of that in kind of the developing world.

209
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:20,260
So like I said, it's difficult to kind of generalize about global cancer.

210
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:31,570
But if you were going to, I would say that in less developed countries, you see more cancers of infectious origin, generally speaking.

211
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:37,149
And in more developed countries you see kind of those Western lifestyle kind of factors like your smoking,

212
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:42,370
your BMI, your diet, lack of exercise, you know, those kinds of things.

213
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:49,030
So if you generalize, that's a generalization, but I think it's fair to say.

214
00:21:54,570 --> 00:22:01,140
Okay. This is also something you can make on that plot.

215
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:06,790
So this is looking at the regions, the regions that you played around with a little bit in one of the earlier questions.

216
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:09,610
And then this is the different infections, right?

217
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:18,510
So in the African region, you have a bunch for HPV, a little bit less for Helicobacter pylori, a little less for have been hep C, right?

218
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:25,240
But if you go down here to the Western Pacific region, you got a ton of you'll go back to pylori and a whole lot of hepatitis B.

219
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:33,520
I also I don't know why I'm apologizing. I didn't mean to say these things, but every single one of these agents starts with a beach.

220
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:37,720
It's like the worst possible thing to have to try to keep in your head.

221
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:41,919
And they all rhyme. HPV. HPV, HCV.

222
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:46,209
I'm like, Guys, we couldn't. No one could come up with any other letters.

223
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:49,390
We had to, like, get all of each and every letter. That was.

224
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:53,020
Yes, that's what we had to do. I apologize. It's just how it is.

225
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:57,750
I didn't do it. I think it's stupid. But there you go.

226
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:06,150
Anything interesting there? Too early.

227
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:11,950
Too early to be interested. Not enough coffee. You got it?

228
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:15,760
Yeah. Wow. Hepatitis C, B, more common than hepatitis B.

229
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:24,380
We have a vaccine for hepatitis B, but not for hepatitis C.

230
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,730
So I think that is a big part of it.

231
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:38,149
So in places where there's a fair bit of vaccination, you you have very little hepatitis B because it's been vaccinated for it.

232
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:45,740
So fewer cancers are related to that. Like the Western about that, the US and the Western Pacific.

233
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:49,969
Now what are we actually now?

234
00:23:49,970 --> 00:24:00,740
We're a region of the Americas, so we're in here. Western Pacific is going to be a lot of Australia and some parts of Asia, I think.

235
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,940
So you're finding out about one of my can. Somebody maybe.

236
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:09,980
Let's look it up real quick. Let's look at a map of the regions.

237
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:21,290
That's a good idea. Yeah.

238
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:26,530
Okay, that's nice, but. Regions.

239
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:35,150
Let's see if we can find an image. And if I can't find one, I will give up.

240
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:43,640
Oh, there we go. That's nice. Okay, so western Pacific, you have China and Japan.

241
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:48,860
Right. So you have a kind of a big chunk of Asia in there.

242
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:53,300
So China does have a fairly large hepatitis and liver cancer tissue.

243
00:24:55,980 --> 00:25:01,350
That makes sense. And then Southeast Asia ends up being India.

244
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:09,710
I would ask, I guess. Thailand, Indonesia.

245
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:16,140
You guys are seeing one of my SO like the pub quiz.

246
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:21,479
You don't want me on sports or geography. You don't want me on either of those things.

247
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:27,090
So if I mess up geography, you can be like, that's not what that is. And I'll be like, Oh, those are fans.

248
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:31,950
That's I'm not I'm good at a lot of things. I am I'm not going to geography.

249
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:33,149
I can admit it about myself.

250
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:41,340
So I apologize if I said it wrong, but I'm pretty sure, pretty sure that's India and probably the country is just north of India.

251
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:45,330
And then you've got I know that's Thailand because I've been there.

252
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,690
I got at least one. To India and Thailand.

253
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:55,989
I got that. Okay, so those are the regions.

254
00:25:55,990 --> 00:26:00,819
So that's what it is. I would not have guessed that that much of China and that part of Asia was in the

255
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:04,490
Western Pacific and seems a little weird that like they jumped from Australia.

256
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:08,260
They're like. Now we're also including us. But this other stuff goes here.

257
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:11,830
I don't know. All right.

258
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:17,540
So these we already talked about these.

259
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:20,990
So let's talk a little bit about the availability of the data.

260
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:27,200
So remember I told you which one it has, like data from not all of the countries, but really high quality.

261
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:40,470
For C.I. five and Global. C.I. five is the one where like if you have a high quality registry, your data can be NCI.

262
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:48,670
So like developing countries or like middle high income countries that are getting their registries off the ground when they get included in sci fi,

263
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:53,310
that's a big deal for them, right? Because they have met the threshold of quality required.

264
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:58,330
So only high quality population based registry data will add up.

265
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:05,520
So if you're looking at sci fi data, you do not have the full picture, but you have very high quality data.

266
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:11,910
This is what you're getting from Global. So the dark green is high quality coverage of more than half the country.

267
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:17,220
The other greens are high quality coverage of of different proportions of the country's population.

268
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,700
And then you've got rates, national averages, regional just frequency data, and G is no data.

269
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:31,200
So if you go on to global can you will get an estimate for these countries that have no data.

270
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:40,600
And how do they do that? So they estimate it. And this this is a paper that was using level three in 2012 data.

271
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:44,040
And we've updated the data, but the idea is still the same, right.

272
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:47,430
It's it hasn't changed markedly in terms of the availability.

273
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:53,640
So essentially, this is a lot of detail about how they do this and how many countries they use this for.

274
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:00,330
But, you know, for 33 countries, they're using the rates of neighboring countries or registries in that same area.

275
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:06,149
Right. So these countries with no data, they're using neighboring countries.

276
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:12,900
But of course, you've got these countries with no data. Their neighboring countries have only frequency or like national rates data.

277
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:18,330
So like you're using and of course, you know, here this country,

278
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:25,260
some of these countries like this one only has one neighboring country as much as in this country.

279
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:32,159
We like to talk about Africa as if it's one place. Each of these countries is very distinct and they have their own cultures.

280
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:36,550
And, you know, all kind of risk factors have to be different.

281
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:43,350
I would imagine cancer rates are different than all kinds of practices and cultural things that would influence.

282
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:50,700
Cancer rates are different from all of these countries. But you're using these if you data from neighboring countries to estimate something

283
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:56,240
for this country that might be totally different and has no data for its own right.

284
00:28:56,250 --> 00:29:01,409
So this is what I mean when you go to global trends like, well, we have data from every country,

285
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:04,920
this is really cool, but it's not the same quality data from every place.

286
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:10,310
Keep this map in mind. Okay.

287
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:19,119
This is mortality data. I would have before I started looking into this, before I learned the stuff,

288
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:23,770
I would have guessed that you would have more mortality data in the world than you would have cancer data.

289
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:30,130
There are lots of places in the world where they do not collect vital statistics, data, births and deaths.

290
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:37,680
So there are places that I was surprised about that have lower quality death registration.

291
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:48,940
Like, I mean, some of the same places that have, don't have, that are very low, um, you know, low development index kind of places.

292
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:53,830
I'm like, okay, fine. But like other places I'm shocked. Like Thailand is one.

293
00:29:54,490 --> 00:30:01,180
They don't have good high quality death registration, which is weird because as you'll see, they actually have really good cancer registration.

294
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:08,590
So death registration is one of those things that is poorly collected in a lot of places, and I was surprised by that.

295
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:13,599
Does that surprise you guys? All right.

296
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,020
So they use some of these same things for estimating mortality.

297
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:22,620
If you're really interested in how they do this or if you need this data at some point or just more detail about how they do this,

298
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:30,670
this is a good publication. So this is just a little graphic of the same thing.

299
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:34,870
You know, you might have national incidents, data that would be the best quality.

300
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:42,980
You might use mortality data to model incidents. They might have regional incidence incidence data and then they would weight that by various

301
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:48,470
population characteristics and other reasons to kind of try to get an estimate for the whole country.

302
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:53,899
They might just have frequency data and they might have no data.

303
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:57,190
And then you're using data from other places. Okay.

304
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:13,460
So there's a lot of efforts being put into trying to develop cancer registries for parts of the world that don't have high quality cancer registries.

305
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:20,149
And I'm trying to see if I have the I don't have I think I have it in the cancer registration match next time.

306
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:25,010
But cancer registration is ungodly expensive, millions of dollars.

307
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:28,040
And we'll talk about the details of how you do it next time.

308
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:33,830
But it is a lot of work, a lot of specialized expertize and a lot of money.

309
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:39,530
And so if you're in a low income country and you've got all of these other public health problems,

310
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:42,530
because as these countries move through the phases of development,

311
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:49,849
it's not like they completely leave behind all of the health problems and public health problems that go along with being a low income country.

312
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:53,990
They still have infectious disease problems and childhood mortality problems and all of that.

313
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:00,079
Right. So and no one's just handed them like a big pot of money suddenly to build a cancer registry.

314
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:04,250
And so that's why they don't have one, right? Because they're prioritizing other things which are fair.

315
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:11,920
So there's this idea about the ICR, the Global Initiative for Cancer Registry Development, which is part of Iraq.

316
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:20,010
They have these six regional hubs that are working in collaboration to strengthen the quality of cancer data and their use in cancer control.

317
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:25,669
So there is some effort by air to try to work with these countries and to put in place

318
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:29,990
some of the skills and infrastructure that's necessary to build these registries.

319
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:34,250
They are not, however, handing out pots of money. Right.

320
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:37,820
So they're helping, but they're not funding.

321
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:49,820
So the aim of the GSR is to save lives. This vision is built on the understanding that an accurate measure of the cancer burden

322
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:54,230
drives improvements in health care systems through national cancer control planning.

323
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:58,130
Over time, this translates to better health, economic and social outcomes.

324
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:03,860
So they're trying to build these countries, these transitioning countries,

325
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:10,430
help them help them build their capacity to collect local cancer data, synthesize the data and disseminate the findings.

326
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:15,380
Right. So they're helping them build their capacity in terms of skills, but they're not handing out money.

327
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:26,030
So these are the this these are the hubs, right.

328
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:33,260
And who's kind of working with them? But those are the areas of the world in which these hubs exist to try to develop these cancer registries.

329
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:43,000
So how do I. I don't know how to unfold this.

330
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:47,880
Anybody help me? View. Yeah.

331
00:33:56,300 --> 00:34:01,600
We've got a structure. Where I could go.

332
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:09,810
Oh, look at you. You win. What if I.

333
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:15,450
Do all of these? Oh, look at me. I did it.

334
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:23,669
Okay. So this is not my dissertation research. This is my students dissertation research.

335
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:33,510
So I had a student and it was Kristian Alvarez, and so he was here on a fellowship from Guatemala.

336
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:41,040
And so he came here and he he started the same program the same year that I started as a professor.

337
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,270
So I was brand new professor.

338
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:53,370
I mostly studied like prostate cancer and other kind of cancers that are common in the U.S. And he had been admitted to the program with a mentor.

339
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:57,840
Dr. Villamor was his mentor because he was the head of the Fogarty fellowship.

340
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:03,120
And Dr. Villamor caught me in the hall and he's like, Hey, would you like a freaking excuse?

341
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:08,879
Didn't I like was free, you know, free things aren't usually good.

342
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:13,740
Why is he free? And he said, well, you know, this fellowship and he really wants to study cancer.

343
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:22,470
And I'm like, great. Like what? What's his area? And, and Eduardo was like, well, you know, he wants to study cervical cancer in Guatemala.

344
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:30,209
And I was like, okay, we're going to draw Venn diagram of what I do and cervical cancer in Guatemala and they do not overlap,

345
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:39,210
but I ended up taking them on. He was a wonderful student and we found this project because Dr. Brozak just left to go to Georgetown.

346
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:46,260
But he was here and he had a lot of global cancer work and she did a lot of work in Thailand, and she's kind of mentor to me as a new faculty member.

347
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:51,740
Like, What am I going to have this guy do? And she's like, We're going to have to work in Thailand, you know, he's going to learn all of this,

348
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:54,569
of these analyzes that you would get to do with like registry data.

349
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:58,320
He's going to meet with these people who set up a registry in a low middle income country.

350
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:02,790
And he's going to learn all kinds of great stuff that he's going to take back to his country.

351
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:07,859
And it worked out perfectly. It was wonderful. So he looked at prostate cancer in Seattle.

352
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:11,129
Tyler So this is Christian right here. That's me.

353
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:22,980
I'm hiding behind this lady. And so a bunch of us actually went to Thailand and these are the workers who run the sample cancer registry.

354
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:32,300
So Songkhla is in southern Thailand and this gentleman right here, that is Dr. Three Blocks.

355
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:35,759
So he is the reason that Thailand has a high quality cancer registry.

356
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:40,110
So a lot of people are like, why Thailand? That seems like a weird place.

357
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:44,700
Like of all the places you could take, why are you why are you studying cancer in Thailand?

358
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:53,190
And the reason is because Hodja in 1989 said we need a population based cancer registry in this country.

359
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:55,920
And they all like what? And he's like, No, we need it.

360
00:36:56,370 --> 00:37:04,860
And so he had a lot of students that had worked with him, and so they had disseminated and gone to various institutions, hospitals and stuff.

361
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:08,460
And he went to them and said, Now I need you to work with me on a registry.

362
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:13,470
And they were like, okay, because they all like super respect and he's amazing.

363
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:20,460
So he put together this registry and software with all of the major hospitals, and he started that in 1990.

364
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:25,770
They expanded it out kind of like seer, like we're going to talk about the Seer model next time,

365
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:30,870
but kind of like sentinel sites at various points around the country to try to get a different population.

366
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:34,529
So they have one cyclone in the south, they've got one in check.

367
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:39,090
My, they've got one up north, they've got one in Cancun, which is kind of in the middle.

368
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:47,240
So they've got I think six or seven sites at this point. And he put it together and these leaders are the ones who run the registry.

369
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:51,180
And so there's like five of them and it's pretty amazing.

370
00:37:51,180 --> 00:38:00,180
So if you want actual real high quality data about what happens to cancer rates when a country transitions, because in 1990,

371
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:06,809
Thailand was kind of a low, low middle income country and they are now a high middle income country or high income country.

372
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:11,889
Right. So if you want actual high quality data from a high quality cancer population based cancer registry

373
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:16,410
about what happens to cancer rates in a population as it moves to these phases of development,

374
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:22,290
Thailand is one of the few places in the world that has that data, so there's no estimates.

375
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:32,430
It's actually good data. So these are the top ten cancer sites in Thailand and versus the world.

376
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,480
So Thailand actually has a lot of liver cancer and lung cancer.

377
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:43,260
Prostate, although it's very common in the world, is less common in Thailand, but it is their fourth most common cancer in them.

378
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:57,179
And so people tend to think of. Prostate cancer is not being as big of a problem in Asian men or is not as big of a problem in Asian countries.

379
00:38:57,180 --> 00:39:02,940
And that is true. There is actually a genetic reason why even better, actually less risk of prostate cancer.

380
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:06,310
But it is their fourth most common cancer in Thailand. So it's not nothing.

381
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:13,800
Right. It's like bladder cancer in our country. And if you look at the the proportion that die, it's much higher.

382
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,820
Okay. So this is Thailand. This is some place in the south, like I said.

383
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,580
So that is where this registry is based.

384
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:31,720
And so what he did was he used the registry data that exists of the dots here before the red line are real data.

385
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:36,280
And to the right of the red line, he is projected out to 2030.

386
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:42,190
Okay. And so we've got incidents in blue and mortality and green.

387
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:48,910
So what you can see is that over the 20 years of data that we had from the start of the registry,

388
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:54,100
both incidence and mortality had increased at an annual percent change of about

389
00:39:54,100 --> 00:40:00,070
5% increase per year for each of these for both incidence and mortality.

390
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:09,550
And these were both quite statistically significant. And if know it continued, you would expect these rates to double by 2030.

391
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:19,730
So. A big reason for this is because of the stage.

392
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:23,350
A diagnosis in Songkhla so localized is the brown.

393
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:27,290
I don't know. Dark orange regional is the middle color.

394
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:32,390
And just as this light color here and then you've got some that are unknown.

395
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:39,220
Actually the majority are unknown, so they're unstaged. But those people are probably high, high stage disease.

396
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,790
Whereas in the U.S. you see a huge number of localized,

397
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:48,160
which is not really a fair comparison because we're doing so much PSA screening, we know we're over diagnosing.

398
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:54,520
So if instead you compare it to a country like the U.K., right, where they are not doing population based PSA screening,

399
00:40:54,940 --> 00:41:00,579
but it's still a country where, you know, they are doing some work on prostate cancer.

400
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:06,880
You can see it's still quite different. Right. Like 30% are localized, 36% regional, only 17% are distant.

401
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:15,640
If we look in Songkhla, part of the way that we can see that the majority of the majority of these

402
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:21,760
unknown stage cancers are distant is if you look at 3% surviving five years.

403
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:25,740
So even in the U.K., it's like 85%, only 41 percentile.

404
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:32,920
So the five year survival is quite low. So most of these people are getting diagnosed at late stage.

405
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:44,020
And so we actually found that if these trends continue for mortality, men in Thailand, Asian men and title, of course,

406
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:51,999
the Asian men in Thailand are going to have higher rates of mortality than men in the U.S. So just the

407
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,100
general mortality rate from prostate cancer going to be higher in Thailand than in the U.S. by 2040.

408
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:04,710
Which is not great. So we have a lot of conversations with them about what kind of screening program they could possibly put in place.

409
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:07,740
I do think that that would be a major a major thing.

410
00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:15,240
The other thing that is true, though, is, you know, so we talk a lot about black, white racial differences.

411
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:19,320
Kind of a similar distinction in Thailand is Buddhist versus Muslim.

412
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:26,840
Right. So the Buddhist community is kind of the majority in Thailand and Muslims are the minority.

413
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:32,909
And if you especially in the south, there's like a 25% Muslim population that's much less than the rest of the country.

414
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:35,400
But in Songkhla area, it's much higher.

415
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:43,230
And part of that is because they get a lot of like Malaysian immigrants, they get a lot of Malay Muslims coming into the south in Thailand.

416
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:47,790
So it's a good place to study kind of these disparities.

417
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:54,580
And so there's a higher incidence of prostate cancer in Buddhist men, but a higher among those who get diagnosed.

418
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:57,570
Mortality is quite a bit higher in women.

419
00:42:58,470 --> 00:43:07,830
Anecdotally, there is a discussion about how even though there's universal health care now and the Muslim immigrants do have access to that,

420
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:10,890
that they don't generally avail themselves of treatment.

421
00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:17,519
Anecdotally, if you talk to physicians in Thailand, they'll tell you that the Muslim men, if they get diagnosed,

422
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:24,390
will just feel like, well, there's kind of a finger with them about it and they tend to go home and not pursue treatment.

423
00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:34,630
So, you know, there is some potential for targeted interventions there, although not being part of that culture, I don't fully understand.

424
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:38,820
But my my understanding is that there is some mistrust and a lot of like kind of the

425
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:42,200
Muslim populations tend to live in more like enclaves and villages of their own.

426
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:48,790
So kind of targeting those interventions would be. We need to be done sensitively, right.

427
00:43:49,870 --> 00:43:54,010
But I think that that is an area for for potential intervention there.

428
00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:57,340
So that was Kristen's dissertation work in a nutshell, which I thought was pretty.

429
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,940
Pretty interesting. All right.

430
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:06,259
So in summary, global cancer is really important.

431
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:08,150
I hope that that's what you're taking away from this,

432
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:16,610
that we have a lack of high quality cancer information and the reasons for that are understandable.

433
00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:27,380
But there's a lot of work that are being put into trying to collect better data from these countries that have a lack of data.

434
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:34,040
These are lower income countries because as we talked about, cancer is going to continue to rise in these countries.

435
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:37,640
It's going to come as we move through this thinking that it's going to become a bigger problem.

436
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,260
And if you don't have data on the scope of the problem, you can't really do anything about it.

437
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:50,570
And the pattern of which cancers are most important in the country will have a lot to do with the culture in that country.

438
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:55,040
The risk factors. People are exposed to all kinds of stuff, right?

439
00:44:55,040 --> 00:45:02,059
And so trying to tailor cancer control programs really does require data from individual countries,

440
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:10,070
like using estimates from another country is not going to cut it. So this is really going to be, you know, to this point here,

441
00:45:10,070 --> 00:45:13,670
there are important geographic heterogeneity in the pattern of cancer that need

442
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:16,850
to be understood in order to develop these national cancer control policies.

443
00:45:18,810 --> 00:45:22,800
So we are done a little bit early today.

444
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:27,430
But these are the resources. That we used.

445
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:31,620
So. Any questions?

446
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:45,720
All right. Next time we are going to talk about cancer registration and after next class, you're going to have Quiz one become available.

447
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:50,840
We will also discuss the final group project next time. Okay.

448
00:45:50,850 --> 00:46:00,540
So I will assign you two groups before next class and then you're going to work in your groups to kind of choose the cancer.

449
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:04,770
And I will talk a little bit more about the project next time.

450
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:14,600
And then do we have? Who's on deck from the news article.

451
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:27,740
Okay, great. So you guys upload your article by tomorrow and then we will hear from you on Thursday.

452
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:34,280
All right. Any last minute questions? All right, everybody, enjoy the rest of your day.

453
00:46:36,990 --> 00:46:40,520
Oh, is it? Yeah, I just.

454
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:41,970
I don't know. I couldn't.
