1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:13,390
It's just like. I was watching the movie to see.

2
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:21,040
I think we had a good afternoon, everyone. Oh, let's see a couple of announcements there.

3
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:30,340
More maybe nice thoughts and reactions. The first one I had is I'm walking into the building and having a peek at the weather forecast.

4
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:34,030
I want to try to be as aggressive as possible of getting us outdoors,

5
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:39,850
any strong objections if we happen to get lucky with a Tuesday afternoon where it's like a really nice afternoon.

6
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:46,330
These class discussions we're having would be really amenable to like hanging out outside together and having that discussion.

7
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:53,440
Anyone object? OK? You know, with the weather around here, it might be like a last minute call.

8
00:00:53,440 --> 00:01:00,750
So with sort of apologies to the group that would be leading that discussion, like there might be like a last minute wrench thrown into it.

9
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:06,700
Um, I don't actually, I probably won't be a big deal. We could maybe share the presentation by mail,

10
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:11,980
and I'll just kind of have it up on laptops or something as the group is leading us through something along those lines.

11
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:18,370
But anyway, I'll I'll, whatever, cross my fingers and hope that that opportunity presents itself.

12
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:21,250
Next on the list is Bridget.

13
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:31,540
Ask me before class about some of the readings for I think it's for next week, a topic around Montreal Protocol, the Kyoto Protocol.

14
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:36,520
And yes, some of the readings are like hundreds of pages, right? So a little bit.

15
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,120
It's a great question. A little bit of background.

16
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:48,250
I I'm not expecting you to allocate 10 hours of the next week, just like reading hundreds of pages that's not necessarily in.

17
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:55,960
However, if we're actually debating policies and protocols and if those documents are actually available,

18
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:00,670
I make it seem like it's my responsibility to make them available through the class site.

19
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:05,140
So they're there more as a reference, maybe you can kind of browse through.

20
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:14,980
I think it's healthy to gain an understanding and appreciate what what goes into these types of documents.

21
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:21,580
As you might imagine, they are long in creation and in finalization.

22
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:29,860
So, yeah, you're not going to be examined on some random thing from page one hundred and seventy two of the Montreal Protocol,

23
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:37,060
for example, on an exam. But you know, all of the readings that look reasonable, please, please get through them.

24
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:42,490
And then maybe just kind of make yourself familiar with some of these more these larger background documents.

25
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:50,670
Does that is that a reasonable answer to your question? Okay, any other questions kind of around this?

26
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:59,970
OK, perfect. So let's see before we get into today's material, I had a couple of more announcements.

27
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:03,390
I guess this one is really only relevant to those of you.

28
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:07,590
They're going to will be here next fall, which I know is only a fraction of you.

29
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:12,750
But those of you that are I learned there was an email this morning.

30
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:18,720
Professor Aurora Lee, who is one of my colleagues in Environmental Health Sciences, is teaching a new course.

31
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:27,810
It's going to be offered next fall 2022 that is focusing on the interplay between psychosocial

32
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:35,430
factors and interactions with both environmental and workplace occupational health.

33
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:41,490
And this is really her background, her expertize where she comes from.

34
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:48,270
And so it would be a really valuable opportunity for those of you that are in the HP program.

35
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:59,160
I think that this course could very easily be kind of justified as maybe a substitution for like one of the selective options in the program.

36
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:07,350
So check it out. I've seen the syllabus, it looks fantastic, and she's also a very engaging presenter.

37
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:15,150
So, yeah, check it out. See if it looks of interest to you, and let me know if you have any questions.

38
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:24,900
And then this one, this would. The timing was just like way to perfect our discussion last week right around Flint Water.

39
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:37,590
Fantastic discussion. And it was actually on the same day, March eight, that the the EPA, as part of White House efforts,

40
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:41,850
put out this memorandum, including a fact sheet, actually had pulled that up.

41
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:50,880
Let me put you through this news article first. The title was EPA wants states to steer new water money to disadvantaged areas.

42
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:58,020
Uh, so communities that struggle disproportionately with higher pollution and environmental risks.

43
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:05,910
So making sure that they get an accurate, equitable share of the new water infrastructure funding over the next five years.

44
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:17,580
And it's specifically mandating that almost half of the money for programs go to these communities.

45
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:28,110
Right. And it's basically forcing states to, uh, revise their definitions, their criteria,

46
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:38,010
their project programs to be able to meet this mandate because the states that are actually giving out the money right at the local level.

47
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:43,800
But many of these would go to disadvantaged communities in the forms of grants and forgivable loans.

48
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:50,070
So this is fantastic. And then, yeah, I did have to have the fact sheet pulled up here.

49
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:52,290
I posted this to the canvas.

50
00:05:52,290 --> 00:06:03,780
It's a three pager, but it basically is kind of go see the highlights of, uh, infrastructure funds that are meeting local water needs nationwide.

51
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:13,980
Any any comments or questions on that? One of the articles also posted on canvas.

52
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:20,980
OK. And then today's topic.

53
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:30,670
So we are shifting gears a little bit and getting into a particular type of chemical classification,

54
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:40,480
as well as a particular type of application right in there use around the category of flame retardants.

55
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:46,390
And you know, a little bit of the background slides that I prepared are not necessarily focused on California.

56
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:54,400
But as we kind of get into further into the discussion, California's played an important role in this process.

57
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,740
I think I mentioned earlier in this semester. I mean,

58
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:05,350
as a state of California has been generally more progressive and regulations and standards that come

59
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:11,410
into play at the state level in California prior to them occurring at the federal level in the U.S.

60
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:19,620
And so and this is another example of where that has occurred.

61
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:29,470
So taking a couple of steps back household fires, I don't think anyone's going to argue that they're not a bad thing, right?

62
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:39,000
There's some statistics here and all of this information comes from the National Fire Protection Association, and these are mostly focused on the US.

63
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:49,770
Although there's some there's some data and subsequent slide that looks at aspects more globally within this country.

64
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:58,110
Fire departments respond to an average of one home fire every 88 seconds seems pretty frequent.

65
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:06,930
Right? Uh, compiling data over a four year period from 2012 to 2016's,

66
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:15,000
fire departments responded to an average of three hundred and fifty five thousand homes structure fires per year.

67
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,840
So he averaged that out. Uh, that is almost a thousand per day.

68
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:30,390
Uh, and then total per year, 11000 civilian injuries or 2500 civilian deaths per year.

69
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:37,290
Uh, and about six and a half billion dollars in direct structural damage per year.

70
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:46,770
So then again, if you look at on average, that's about seven people per day dying in the U.S. as a result of home fires.

71
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:56,520
Interestingly, these last two bullets here are both interesting. Cooking is the leading cause of home fires, as well as home fire injuries.

72
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:01,200
But when you're looking specifically at the leading causes of home fire deaths,

73
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:10,570
it's actually smoking primarily cigaret smoking in the more recent decades.

74
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:17,260
All right, so home buyers bad that hopefully we're all on the same page with that one.

75
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:28,330
There was this really interesting publicized data across the electronics industry back in the 1990s,

76
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:37,510
the early 1990s, and it came out of Sweden, which is the bluish purple bar in this and this plot.

77
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:52,720
And it resulted a really high relative number of fires per TV, right, that's distributed, sold and mostly used in residential areas.

78
00:09:52,720 --> 00:10:03,400
And it was basically the the foundation for flame retardants just spread very broadly across consumer electronics.

79
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:11,050
So not just in TVs. So now as we sit here, all of our laptops and our computers and our phones are flame retardants all over the place,

80
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:18,970
right to help prevent flames and fires 20 years later.

81
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:29,350
This publication came out that produced this plot. This is from Arlene Bloom's group, which some of the readings that were posted came from her group.

82
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:36,490
There's also a video that showed up her TED talk before we start the class discussion.

83
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:46,300
And yeah, their group's analysis said, Well, looking back, this this Sweden data, whatever the heck is going on, it's completely an outlier, right?

84
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:59,470
So if you look at nearby countries Norway, the Netherlands, England and including the US, those rates of fires in televisions was much, much lower.

85
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:10,360
So perhaps this was not the the best rationale for that foundation, but nonetheless it's already occurred right over the course of those 20 years.

86
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:19,570
Flame retardants are part of consumer electronics. We'll talk a little bit about the chemical classification here in a minute.

87
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:31,570
But for the most part, or this data is specific to a certain component of flame retardants, Holly brominated data panel beaters.

88
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:45,650
And it turns out that they don't just stay where they're applied, whether it's furniture, electronics, children's pajamas, toys,

89
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:59,980
uh, all kinds of things that we interact with as consumer products and we can see them when we measure all across wildlife.

90
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:08,890
Most of the data on this plot is from North America. There are a couple from Greenland and it shows, you know, pretty market.

91
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:10,300
There's different slopes,

92
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:20,680
but they're all increasing right over the couple of decade period prior to the implementation of the widespread use of these flame retardants.

93
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:24,730
And it just to, you know, pull out a couple of highlights here. Yes, it does.

94
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:33,190
Here's humans. The black line down here is the content of PETA and people in the US.

95
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:40,270
This is looking at the worldwide demand of PBDEs and then different fish seals,

96
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:51,070
whales and so forth, increasing levels of these compounds in the environment.

97
00:12:51,070 --> 00:13:00,490
All right, so a little bit about flame retardant, so they are more generally how you needed.

98
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:06,520
So that's what the poly bromine, right? The bromine is the halogen. It's part of the compound.

99
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:17,210
There are others that are slightly different, but they persist in the environment and build up in water bodies,

100
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:23,080
both freshwater as well as marine ecosystems, terrestrial ecosystems all around the globe.

101
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:28,540
And the highest levels are found in predators such as marine mammals, right?

102
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:32,800
We with other whales in the field in the previous plot, the birds of prey and then, of course,

103
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:41,170
humans more specific to to humans and animals here in terms of exposures have been linked to adverse health effects.

104
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:49,270
And there's a decent accumulating list that includes includes endocrine and thyroid disruption, immuno toxicity,

105
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:57,490
reproductive toxicity, cancers, adverse effects on fetal and child development, as well as neurological function.

106
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:05,770
And some of the organophosphate flame retardants specifically are classified as human carcinogens.

107
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:10,790
So cancer causing.

108
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:22,520
Starting to to narrow into California, to transition a little bit here to California, a couple of distinctions around these flame retardants,

109
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:29,870
they can either be mixed with a base material in which case they're referred to as an additive flame retardant,

110
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:36,560
or they might be chemically bonded to that base material. So in that case, they're considered a reactive wing retardant.

111
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:43,260
The additive flame retardants can escape from the consumer products and settle into house dust.

112
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:50,840
And so this is very easily ends up being a major route of exposure, especially to children,

113
00:14:50,840 --> 00:15:01,910
to these flame retardants that end up in house dust due to its widespread use again across consumer products and especially here in the US.

114
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:07,610
Americans carry much higher levels of flame retardants in their bodies than anywhere else in the world.

115
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:19,230
And for reasons that we'll talk about here in a few minutes, California children have some of the highest levels ever reported.

116
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:25,980
So we talked about consumer products in general, flame retardant chemicals have been added to polyurethane foam,

117
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:32,010
right, which is kind of the most like furniture, cushions and they say the thing textiles, building materials.

118
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:38,730
We talked about electronics and other consumer products to meet flammability standards that

119
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:43,830
were put into place by the state of California as part of California's technical bulletin.

120
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:52,200
117. Uh, that TV 117 was revised because it didn't adequately address the flammability of

121
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:58,020
upholstery cover fabric and its interactions with the underlying building materials.

122
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:10,410
So this new standard that went into place in January 2015 was TV 117 deaths 2013, and it was intended to improve fire safety,

123
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:16,380
and it often eliminated the need for flame retardant chemicals, but it didn't preclude their use.

124
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:23,670
Then finally, in 2018, a ban on flame retardants was signed the California law.

125
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:29,250
This covered children's products, mattress foam and upholstered furniture.

126
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:39,250
Since then, it's continued to be considered by subsequent states not many, but a small handful in terms of this ban.

127
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:50,100
And I don't want to step on the toes of the discussion, but just like kind of a slight context of a background and a lot of these industries,

128
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:56,310
if a standard is put into place that they need to meet as part of their manufacturing processes,

129
00:16:56,310 --> 00:17:03,840
it's more costly to manufacture a product to sell here and then manufacture it differently to sell here.

130
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:09,390
So California being a pretty big, I mean, it's it's it's bigger than many countries, right?

131
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:13,890
40 million people. So if the entire state of California is requiring this,

132
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:18,930
many of the industries and manufacturers basically just started producing all of their products,

133
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:27,000
regardless of whether they were just sold in California or not, and therefore they were distributed widely.

134
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:40,260
And then that leads us to a short video that is from Arlene Bloom's group or actually her.

135
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:46,350
Let's see what slight background on this is the date stamp this was produced in 2010.

136
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:52,020
OK, so maybe you look at it as a little bit of a historical context.

137
00:17:52,020 --> 00:18:01,800
Some of the things there she refers to are no longer the case because now we're in 20 22 and policies and legislations have have changed since then.

138
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:05,850
But it's a really great introduction to the issue, to the problem.

139
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:09,240
She delivers it at a really understandable level,

140
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:18,210
and I think all we do is have any questions on any of the slides that were presented before we play this.

141
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:51,180
All right. And I'll do a quick audio check to make sure it's working for folks.

142
00:18:51,180 --> 00:31:59,820
Not loud enough, Dr. Here.

143
00:31:59,820 --> 00:34:26,560
I. All right.

144
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:34,180
So, uh, yeah, I really appreciate that there's lots of videos of flame retardants, but that one in particular resonates with me.

145
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:42,040
I think it does, and a concise manner kind of summarizes the history, the rationale, how we've gotten to where we are now.

146
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:50,860
And again, it's a 2010 video. So we're we're 12 years down the road from it, but with good intentions, right?

147
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:58,810
To help protect people from from house fires. We've created this monstrous industry now, uh,

148
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:08,170
flame retardant chemicals and their application to basically everything we we interact with in terms of the products that we buy.

149
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:19,000
So, uh, any any comments or questions on the video without getting too deep again, just to not step on the toes of the student led discussion?

150
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:25,980
That has to come.

151
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:36,060
All right, so I'm going to propose let's do it again a few minutes early, let's take a quick five minute break and reconvene, let's say, 142 or so.

152
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:45,200
And go ahead with our last discussion and one like the group to come on up and get themselves set up.

153
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:49,910
One of us need to email it to you, I, or have somebody sent it to me.

154
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:52,947
Thank you.
