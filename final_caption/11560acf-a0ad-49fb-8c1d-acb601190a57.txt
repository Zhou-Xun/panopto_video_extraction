1
00:00:08,823 --> 00:00:12,307
You probably know that the population
of planet Earth is growing, but

2
00:00:12,307 --> 00:00:14,679
have you ever wondered
how fast it's growing?

3
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:19,643
How many people are added to the planet,
every second, every minute, every year?

4
00:00:19,643 --> 00:00:24,615
Well, it turns out that there's about
2.5 people added to our population every

5
00:00:24,615 --> 00:00:25,191
second.

6
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:29,712
About 141 people are roughly
a planeload added every minute.

7
00:00:29,712 --> 00:00:33,507
And every year, there are 78
million new people on this planet.

8
00:00:33,507 --> 00:00:36,769
That's roughly the country
of Egypt's population.

9
00:00:36,769 --> 00:00:42,234
The question then becomes exactly where
are we going to put all these people?

10
00:00:42,234 --> 00:00:45,015
I'd like to highlight
the growth in human population

11
00:00:45,015 --> 00:00:47,683
absolutely drives
environmental health issues.

12
00:00:47,683 --> 00:00:51,611
You may realize this intuitively, but
I'd like to show you some visual examples.

13
00:00:51,611 --> 00:00:55,991
What we're looking at here are images
of the city of Shanghai in China.

14
00:00:55,991 --> 00:00:59,997
Shanghai, perhaps one of the most rapidly
developing cities in the history of

15
00:00:59,997 --> 00:01:00,613
the world.

16
00:01:00,613 --> 00:01:05,425
So this first photo looks at Shanghai
in approximately the year 2000 and

17
00:01:05,425 --> 00:01:10,763
you can see it's already a fairly built
up city with some high-rise construction,

18
00:01:10,763 --> 00:01:12,584
and fair amount of density.

19
00:01:12,584 --> 00:01:16,085
But then if you look at this
next photo of Shanghai in 2015,

20
00:01:16,085 --> 00:01:19,603
that's the same Bend in the river
that we're looking at here.

21
00:01:19,603 --> 00:01:24,275
You can see there's just been explosive
growth upward where now we have some

22
00:01:24,275 --> 00:01:29,386
exceedingly tall buildings added to what
was already a pretty congested skyline.

23
00:01:29,386 --> 00:01:31,883
We can also look at this in
a slightly different perspective.

24
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:36,742
These are some images from the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration,

25
00:01:36,742 --> 00:01:40,251
NASA showing Shanghai from
overhead via satellite view.

26
00:01:40,251 --> 00:01:43,809
So here's an image of hi
taken in April of 1984.

27
00:01:43,809 --> 00:01:48,743
You can see the city is basically the sort
of black gray cluster of buildings and

28
00:01:48,743 --> 00:01:51,359
Roads towards the center of the image,,

29
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:54,372
growing towards the banks
of the nearby river.

30
00:01:54,372 --> 00:01:57,374
If we fast forward just
five years to 1989,

31
00:01:57,374 --> 00:02:00,838
you can see the city has
started to expand it somewhat.

32
00:02:00,838 --> 00:02:03,243
Going forward to 1994, again,

33
00:02:03,243 --> 00:02:07,827
you can see the city has continued
to grow at a relatively modest pace.

34
00:02:07,827 --> 00:02:10,021
But if we fast forward to 1999,

35
00:02:10,021 --> 00:02:14,202
you can now see the city is really
starting to expand its footprint.

36
00:02:14,202 --> 00:02:19,152
Going forward to 2004, now you can see
that the city has grown to come into

37
00:02:19,152 --> 00:02:24,351
contact with the river area, but also
expanded in all other directions as well.

38
00:02:24,351 --> 00:02:29,970
By 2009,you can see the city has continued
to grow now basically spanning the river.

39
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:34,458
And if we fast forward to 2014,
you can see what was initially

40
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:39,366
a relatively small city has now
sprawled into an enormous metropolis.

41
00:02:39,366 --> 00:02:46,331
By 2016 just two years later, the growth
has continued in an observable manner.

42
00:02:46,331 --> 00:02:50,635
In 2014, there were about seven billion
people that lived on planet Earth.

43
00:02:50,635 --> 00:02:55,280
And as I've already said, there's another
78 million or so that are added annually.

44
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,352
If we project forward by 2025, we're
anticipating a population of 8 billion.

45
00:03:00,352 --> 00:03:03,909
And by 2050,
depending on what predictions you look at.

46
00:03:03,909 --> 00:03:09,840
The population could be somewhere between
9.4 billion and 10.2 billion people.

47
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,288
Now, that growth is not happening
equally around the world.

48
00:03:12,288 --> 00:03:16,208
In fact, greater than 90% of the growth
is occurring in the world's developing

49
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:16,825
countries.

50
00:03:16,825 --> 00:03:21,138
Primarily in sub-Saharan Africa,
in the Middle East and in South Asia.

51
00:03:21,138 --> 00:03:25,278
There's actually a bit of good news here
in that the current population growth

52
00:03:25,278 --> 00:03:28,804
rate is actually slower than was
projected back in the 1970s.

53
00:03:28,804 --> 00:03:30,369
So in fact, in 1970,

54
00:03:30,369 --> 00:03:35,364
the projection going forward was that
the population would grow by 2% annually.

55
00:03:35,364 --> 00:03:40,501
But in fact the annual growth
rate in 2014 was only 1.17%.

56
00:03:40,501 --> 00:03:43,271
That can sound like a small
sort of rounding error.

57
00:03:43,271 --> 00:03:46,898
But when you consider we're
talking about means of people,

58
00:03:46,898 --> 00:03:50,892
even that small percentage change
can add up to a huge difference.

59
00:03:50,892 --> 00:03:55,135
Here's a photo of Tokyo, which is
considered the largest urban area in

60
00:03:55,135 --> 00:03:57,834
the world with a population of 38 million.

61
00:03:57,834 --> 00:03:59,536
If you haven't been to Tokyo,

62
00:03:59,536 --> 00:04:03,660
I can convey to you from my personal
experience that this is a very realistic

63
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,731
depiction of Tokyo and other incredibly
dense highly populated cities.

64
00:04:07,731 --> 00:04:09,633
We've got just lots and lots of people.

65
00:04:09,633 --> 00:04:13,826
And again, the challenge is how do
we accommodate all these people and

66
00:04:13,826 --> 00:04:16,538
ensure that they have
access to good health.

67
00:04:16,538 --> 00:04:20,869
We've got a number of factors that work
together here to determine population

68
00:04:20,869 --> 00:04:21,534
pressure.

69
00:04:21,534 --> 00:04:24,528
The first one I'd like to
highlight is fertility rate.

70
00:04:24,528 --> 00:04:29,307
And so back in 1970, the average
woman on the planet was having 4.8

71
00:04:29,307 --> 00:04:34,163
children over her lifetime contrast
that to 2014 where that number had

72
00:04:34,163 --> 00:04:37,648
dropped by nearly half to
2.5 children per woman.

73
00:04:37,648 --> 00:04:41,205
The graph you're looking at here
shows fertility rates by country.

74
00:04:41,205 --> 00:04:43,986
And so here, you can see that for
most of the world,

75
00:04:43,986 --> 00:04:47,418
they're In light brown or
darker brown basically at the bottom

76
00:04:47,418 --> 00:04:50,416
end of the scale here with
the lowest fertility rates.

77
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:54,082
But again, Sub-Saharan Africa,
the Middle East and South Asia,

78
00:04:54,082 --> 00:04:58,025
we see countries with some of the highest
fertility rates on the planet.

79
00:04:58,025 --> 00:05:00,646
So that's one factor that's
driving population pressure.

80
00:05:00,646 --> 00:05:03,375
Another one is average life expectancy.

81
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:08,510
Back in 1970, the average person on
the planet was going to live 59 years.

82
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:14,733
If we fast forward to 2014, now
the average life expectancy is 72 years.

83
00:05:14,733 --> 00:05:18,334
And finally, the third factor
to consider is the death rate.

84
00:05:18,334 --> 00:05:23,597
So back in 1970, 12 out of every 1,000
people would die on an annual basis.

85
00:05:23,597 --> 00:05:29,845
In 2014, that number had dropped, again,
almost in half to 7.7 per 1,000 people.

86
00:05:29,845 --> 00:05:33,251
So we've got fertility which
has been declining, but

87
00:05:33,251 --> 00:05:38,149
that's sort of counteracted by people
living longer and fewer people dying.

88
00:05:38,149 --> 00:05:43,410
All of these things are resulting
in our current population pressure.

89
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,590
In fact, if we look around the world,

90
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:49,896
there are 65 countries that are now
below replacement level fertility.

91
00:05:49,896 --> 00:05:55,390
Basically, that means these countries are
having fewer than 2.1 children per couple.

92
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,450
Why 2.1 children?

93
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:59,744
Well, we need 2 children to
replace the 2 parents and

94
00:05:59,744 --> 00:06:03,265
the 0.1 basically accounts for
childhood mortality.

95
00:06:03,265 --> 00:06:06,394
So of these 65 countries whose
populations are declining,

96
00:06:06,394 --> 00:06:10,306
because they're no longer replacing
their population through fertility,

97
00:06:10,306 --> 00:06:12,364
56 of those countries are developed.

98
00:06:12,364 --> 00:06:15,559
So we see At these countries
that have stabilized or

99
00:06:15,559 --> 00:06:18,235
whose population is started to stagnate or

100
00:06:18,235 --> 00:06:22,848
even shrink our well-over-represented
among developed countries and

101
00:06:22,848 --> 00:06:27,328
there are very few developing countries
on this list around the world.

102
00:06:27,328 --> 00:06:31,148
The fastest population growth is
happening in regions that unfortunately

103
00:06:31,148 --> 00:06:34,310
are also facing the greatest
environmental health hazards.

104
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:38,707
So these are things like air pollution and
water pollution, and injuries.

105
00:06:38,707 --> 00:06:41,198
The graph we're looking
at here shows levels and

106
00:06:41,198 --> 00:06:44,730
trends of the world's population
broken out by different regions.

107
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:49,774
And so you can see there's estimates
going back to 1975 all the way forward

108
00:06:49,774 --> 00:06:54,297
to 2015 and then projections
forward from 2015 to 2050.

109
00:06:54,297 --> 00:06:58,221
So I'd like to draw your attention to
a few of the trend lines on this graph.

110
00:06:58,221 --> 00:07:01,932
You can see the lines clustered around
the bottom of the graph are for

111
00:07:01,932 --> 00:07:05,992
places like Europe and Latin America,
and North America, and Oceania.

112
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:10,324
So basically, we're seeing essentially
a perfectly flat trend there

113
00:07:10,324 --> 00:07:15,017
no real increase in population, but
the two lines that goes swooping upwards

114
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:18,769
out of the bottom of this graph
correspond to Africa in blue and

115
00:07:18,769 --> 00:07:21,103
Asia in dark red and you can see there.

116
00:07:21,103 --> 00:07:26,119
We see tremendous population growth
with Asia in the lead through 2015 and

117
00:07:26,119 --> 00:07:31,287
maintaining that lead or greatest
population through 2050, but Africa has

118
00:07:31,287 --> 00:07:37,232
sort of rapidly increasing and potentially
converging with Asia around the year 2100.

119
00:07:37,232 --> 00:07:40,954
So we know that environmental health
hazards are present around the world,

120
00:07:40,954 --> 00:07:44,864
but we do know that Asia and Africa and
particularly the developing countries.

121
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:49,752
There are facing greater environmental
health hazards than some other countries

122
00:07:49,752 --> 00:07:50,896
around the world.

123
00:07:50,896 --> 00:07:52,607
All this leads to a natural question,

124
00:07:52,607 --> 00:07:54,700
which is what is Earth's
carrying capacity.

125
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:58,801
In other words, what's the maximum
supportable human population?

126
00:07:58,801 --> 00:08:03,061
Well, we currently have about 3.5 billion
acres of arable land that we can use for

127
00:08:03,061 --> 00:08:04,028
food production.

128
00:08:04,028 --> 00:08:07,011
If everybody on the planet wanted
to live like a vegetarian,

129
00:08:07,011 --> 00:08:10,825
it's anticipated that we could have
a population of as many as 10 billion.

130
00:08:10,825 --> 00:08:13,861
But if everyone wants to live
like a citizen in the US and

131
00:08:13,861 --> 00:08:17,491
be an omnivore with, for example,
a lot of consumption of meat,

132
00:08:17,491 --> 00:08:22,375
the sustainable population is more like
2.5 billion which is a problem, of course,

133
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:25,760
because we've already got 7
billion plus living on the planet.

134
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:29,527
What we're hoping to avoid here is
something called Thomas Malthus's

135
00:08:29,527 --> 00:08:30,347
catastrophe.

136
00:08:30,347 --> 00:08:34,067
So this was an idea put forth
by Thomas Malthus in 1798.

137
00:08:34,067 --> 00:08:36,954
You can see Illustrated in
the chart on the right here.

138
00:08:36,954 --> 00:08:41,419
So basically, what Thomas Malthus
predicted is that if we look over time and

139
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:43,931
time is our x-axis with increasing time,

140
00:08:43,931 --> 00:08:46,677
we expect our production
of food to increase.

141
00:08:46,677 --> 00:08:50,354
So you'll see a straight line on that
graph labeled production of food.

142
00:08:50,354 --> 00:08:54,267
So as there's more of us, more of us
are able to work the land and create food.

143
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:57,832
So we have that very linear
growth in food production.

144
00:08:57,832 --> 00:09:00,673
The problem is population
doesn't grow linearly.

145
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:04,806
You can see their swooping upward line
labeled population on this graph.

146
00:09:04,806 --> 00:09:07,928
The population growth is relatively
linear at the start, but

147
00:09:07,928 --> 00:09:10,157
then starts to exponentially accelerate.

148
00:09:10,157 --> 00:09:14,067
What we're trying to avoid here is what's
labeled as the Malthusian catastrophe.

149
00:09:14,067 --> 00:09:17,495
We're basically our population
has exceeded the ability.

150
00:09:17,495 --> 00:09:19,342
We have to feed that population.

151
00:09:19,342 --> 00:09:22,600
That's going to lead to collapse and
catastrophe.

152
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,337
Now, there's consensus on three things
that we need to do to come up with

153
00:09:26,337 --> 00:09:27,826
a sustainable population.

154
00:09:27,826 --> 00:09:29,874
One is to protect the environment.

155
00:09:29,874 --> 00:09:34,794
Two is to increase living standards and
achieve health equity for everyone,

156
00:09:34,794 --> 00:09:37,377
and three is to slow population growth.

157
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:38,651
So we have these three needs.

158
00:09:38,651 --> 00:09:40,195
We need to protect the environment.

159
00:09:40,195 --> 00:09:42,170
We need to increase living standards and

160
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:44,559
we need to slow population
growth fortunately.

161
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:46,430
These things are mutually reinforcing.

162
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:50,914
And if we can accomplish all three we
should be able to achieve a see the animal

163
00:09:50,914 --> 00:09:52,535
population on the planet.

164
00:09:52,535 --> 00:09:57,329
Now, I want to wrap up by highlighting
that pressure on resources from population

165
00:09:57,329 --> 00:10:00,935
is absolutely not equitably
distributed around the world.

166
00:10:00,935 --> 00:10:03,563
In the US and
everywhere around the world, we have in

167
00:10:03,563 --> 00:10:07,230
equitable distribution of resources and
that tends to lead to poverty.

168
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:09,276
We see that in the United States.

169
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:12,046
But when we look globally,
we see more extreme poverty.

170
00:10:12,046 --> 00:10:19,310
So for example, about 10% of Earth's
population earns less than $1.90 per day.

171
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:20,143
That sounds terrible.

172
00:10:20,143 --> 00:10:21,261
It's actually good news.

173
00:10:21,261 --> 00:10:25,004
That number is down by more
than a third since 1990.

174
00:10:25,004 --> 00:10:27,624
We know that more than
half of the extremely poor

175
00:10:27,624 --> 00:10:30,716
population in the world
lives in Sub-Saharan Africa.

176
00:10:30,716 --> 00:10:35,601
We also know that 11% of the world's
population can't satisfy their basic daily

177
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:40,210
food needs and that the global poor who
are making these extremely small amounts

178
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:44,092
of money, and facing food insecurity
tend to live in rural areas.

179
00:10:44,092 --> 00:10:45,514
They're poorly educated.

180
00:10:45,514 --> 00:10:50,747
They're employed in agriculture typically
and their children less than 18 years old.

181
00:10:50,747 --> 00:10:53,861
So all of that information is tragic and
troubling.

182
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:55,174
The good news is again,

183
00:10:55,174 --> 00:10:59,187
we have tools available to us to deal
with this in environmental health.

184
00:10:59,187 --> 00:11:04,100
So once we identify these populations with
the correct political will and resources,

185
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:08,475
we have ways to address these challenges
of environmental health threats and

186
00:11:08,475 --> 00:11:09,230
nutrition.

187
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:13,190
We simply need the will to do so and
we absolutely have to find that will in

188
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:19,296
order to ensure that people around the
world have good health, and health equity.
