1
00:00:02,577 --> 00:00:06,368
In the next portion of the lecture,
I'll provide an overview of the health

2
00:00:06,368 --> 00:00:13,058
behaviors that pose the greatest
risk to population health.

3
00:00:13,058 --> 00:00:18,985
Taken together, tobacco use,
poor diet, and physical inactivity,

4
00:00:18,985 --> 00:00:26,113
account for approximately one-third of
early or avoidable deaths before age 80.

5
00:00:26,113 --> 00:00:29,355
Given the scale and
complexity of these factors,

6
00:00:29,355 --> 00:00:33,843
you'll have subsequent lectures
focusing on these three factors.

7
00:00:33,843 --> 00:00:36,286
So I'll touch on these issues briefly, but

8
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:39,862
go into greater detail talking
about other major risk factors.

9
00:00:39,862 --> 00:00:47,713
Including, but not limited to, alcohol
use, motor vehicles, and illicit drug use.

10
00:00:47,713 --> 00:00:52,020
It will come at no surprise to you
that smoking takes an enormous toll on

11
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,074
the health of the US population.

12
00:00:54,074 --> 00:00:58,821
Approximately 15% of premature
mortality is linked to smoking, and

13
00:00:58,821 --> 00:01:03,196
nearly half a million deaths
annually are attributed to smoking.

14
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:08,370
The average smoker loses about ten years
of life because of their smoking habit.

15
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:10,828
In addition to the toll on population and

16
00:01:10,828 --> 00:01:15,399
individual level health, the economic
toll of smoking is astronomical.

17
00:01:15,399 --> 00:01:20,210
The cost to the country is
over $300 billion per year in

18
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:25,132
terms of healthcare expenditures and
lost productivity.

19
00:01:25,132 --> 00:01:28,798
Though still a grave problem,
as you'll learn in the subsequent lecture.

20
00:01:28,798 --> 00:01:33,186
The story of tobacco is actually
one of the greatest public health

21
00:01:33,186 --> 00:01:36,070
success stories of the past half century.

22
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:39,279
Certainly, there are many
more illnesses and

23
00:01:39,279 --> 00:01:44,221
deaths that can be prevented with
further reduction in smoking rates.

24
00:01:44,221 --> 00:01:47,859
But the decline in smoking
among the American public is

25
00:01:47,859 --> 00:01:51,031
actually a remarkable
public health success.

26
00:01:51,031 --> 00:01:53,316
I'll leave the details
of that story to Dr.

27
00:01:53,316 --> 00:01:59,908
Ken Warner,
who will be providing the tobacco lecture.

28
00:01:59,908 --> 00:02:03,397
Centers for
Disease Control Director Thomas Frieden,

29
00:02:03,397 --> 00:02:07,712
called physical activity the closest
thing we have to a wonder drug.

30
00:02:07,712 --> 00:02:13,330
For its ability to prevent or reduce
symptoms related to tens of diseases.

31
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:17,940
The graphic in front of you lists just
some of the health benefits of physical

32
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:18,668
activity.

33
00:02:18,668 --> 00:02:23,053
The flip side of the picture is
the severity of poor diet and

34
00:02:23,053 --> 00:02:24,853
physical inactivity.

35
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:29,737
In the past decade, poor diet and
physical inactivity have surpassed tobacco

36
00:02:29,737 --> 00:02:32,551
as the biggest threat
to population health.

37
00:02:32,551 --> 00:02:36,844
And the problem is,
no pun intended, growing.

38
00:02:36,844 --> 00:02:41,173
Again, a future lecture is devoted
entirely to learning about how

39
00:02:41,173 --> 00:02:47,704
poor diet and lack of exercise
are shaping population-level health.

40
00:02:47,704 --> 00:02:51,705
I'm going to dive a little
deeper into how alcohol-use and

41
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:54,037
abuse affect population health.

42
00:02:54,037 --> 00:02:58,668
Both because it has an enormous
impact on the population's health.

43
00:02:58,668 --> 00:03:03,447
But also because the public health
messaging around alcohol use is a bit more

44
00:03:03,447 --> 00:03:08,314
complicated than some of the other
behaviors we'll be talking about today.

45
00:03:08,314 --> 00:03:13,039
Around 90,000 deaths annually
can be linked to alcohol use.

46
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:16,550
And a little bit over half of those
are due to acute causes of death.

47
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:22,476
Including overdose, alcohol-related
crashes, falls, drownings, or suicide.

48
00:03:22,476 --> 00:03:27,310
About 45% of those deaths are linked
to chronic longer term use.

49
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:31,352
And those deaths are due to liver disease,
stroke, hypertension, and

50
00:03:31,352 --> 00:03:37,248
other factors you can see
listed on this slide.

51
00:03:37,248 --> 00:03:42,629
This slide shows that complex relationship
that I alluded to a moment ago.

52
00:03:42,629 --> 00:03:46,945
This graph shows the relationship
between alcohol use, or

53
00:03:46,945 --> 00:03:49,716
alcohol consumption, on the x axis.

54
00:03:49,716 --> 00:03:53,126
Which is divided into no,

55
00:03:53,126 --> 00:03:57,469
moderate, and heavy drinking.

56
00:03:57,469 --> 00:04:02,676
And the rate of heart
disease on the y axis.

57
00:04:02,676 --> 00:04:06,990
What you see here is a u-shaped
relationship between drinking and

58
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:08,074
heart disease.

59
00:04:08,074 --> 00:04:12,837
Individuals who do not drink at all
have greater rates of heart disease

60
00:04:12,837 --> 00:04:14,621
than moderate drinkers.

61
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:16,769
And then, heavy drinkers, again,

62
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:20,318
have heart disease at higher
rates than moderate drinkers.

63
00:04:20,318 --> 00:04:24,705
Higher rates among people
who do not drink at all, and

64
00:04:24,705 --> 00:04:28,031
on people who consume alcohol heavily.

65
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:31,384
So the public health message
would be something like this.

66
00:04:31,384 --> 00:04:34,990
Drinking a moderate amount is good for
you,

67
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:39,379
but drinking too much, or
not at all, is bad for you.

68
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:43,070
That's a complicated message
to communicate meaningfully.

69
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:47,029
And certainly we don't want to
encourage people who don't drink at

70
00:04:47,029 --> 00:04:48,423
all to start drinking.

71
00:04:48,423 --> 00:04:52,783
But on the other hand, we do want to let
those who do drink moderately know that

72
00:04:52,783 --> 00:04:55,347
there might be some
health benefits to that.

73
00:04:55,347 --> 00:05:01,250
Again, a complicated
public health message.

74
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:05,770
I want to look a little bit more closely
at those who are missing this message

75
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:09,586
about drinking in moderation,
those who are binge drinking.

76
00:05:09,586 --> 00:05:14,373
This is poignant, because this is
a salient topic for young adults, and

77
00:05:14,373 --> 00:05:17,052
particularly among college students.

78
00:05:17,052 --> 00:05:21,318
Estimates from the 2015
National Survey on Drug Use and

79
00:05:21,318 --> 00:05:26,352
Health show that among those 12 and
older who are current drinkers,

80
00:05:26,352 --> 00:05:30,037
just under half, or 48%,
are binge drinkers.

81
00:05:30,037 --> 00:05:34,567
And about a quarter of binge drinkers
are categorized as heavy users.

82
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:41,094
Those who report binge drinking on five or
more occasions in the last 30 days.

83
00:05:41,094 --> 00:05:47,774
So on one hand, these findings show that
half of all drinkers drink in moderation.

84
00:05:47,774 --> 00:05:52,657
But the data also show that many
millions of people are binge drinking.

85
00:05:52,657 --> 00:05:59,337
And a good chunk of those folks
are binge drinking with some frequency.

86
00:05:59,337 --> 00:06:03,704
This graph shows the two inner
circles from the previous slide, and

87
00:06:03,704 --> 00:06:08,083
looks at the distribution of binge and
heavy drinking by age group.

88
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:10,722
We can see that alcohol abuse is

89
00:06:10,722 --> 00:06:15,606
most concentrated in the 18
to 25 year old age group.

90
00:06:15,606 --> 00:06:19,635
Among 18 to 25 year olds who
drank in the past month,

91
00:06:19,635 --> 00:06:24,115
nearly 40% report at least one
episode of binge drinking.

92
00:06:24,115 --> 00:06:26,406
And more than 10% report five or

93
00:06:26,406 --> 00:06:29,814
more episodes of binge
drinking in the past month.

94
00:06:29,814 --> 00:06:34,044
Take a minute to think about how this
data aligns with your own experiences or

95
00:06:34,044 --> 00:06:39,531
observations, as a University
of Michigan student.

96
00:06:39,531 --> 00:06:44,070
Again, the data on this slide
shows national estimates.

97
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:48,440
The most recent data, from the University
of Michigan's Student Life Survey.

98
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:52,771
Suggests that rates of binge drinking
are actually higher among University of

99
00:06:52,771 --> 00:06:58,861
Michigan students than
these national estimates.

100
00:06:58,861 --> 00:07:03,759
Sometimes in public health,
we get caught up looking at statistics,

101
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,750
like number of excess deaths, or
number of potential life years lost.

102
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:12,611
And we fail to talk about
other equally serious, but

103
00:07:12,611 --> 00:07:16,404
more tangible consequences
of health behaviors.

104
00:07:16,404 --> 00:07:19,984
On college campuses each
year across the country,

105
00:07:19,984 --> 00:07:24,741
more than 1,800 students die
from alcohol related injuries.

106
00:07:24,741 --> 00:07:28,358
We don't lose a student at the University
of Michigan every year, but

107
00:07:28,358 --> 00:07:31,182
many years, we do.

108
00:07:31,182 --> 00:07:35,948
The number of deaths attributed to
alcohol is way, way too big, but

109
00:07:35,948 --> 00:07:40,472
there are some other numbers that
I also want you to think about.

110
00:07:40,472 --> 00:07:44,034
The number of assaults that
occur on college campuses,

111
00:07:44,034 --> 00:07:47,611
linked to student drinking
is almost 700,000.

112
00:07:47,611 --> 00:07:53,624
Annual reports of sexual assault,
or date rape, almost 100,000.

113
00:07:53,624 --> 00:07:57,450
And that's just the reported
incidents of sexual assault,

114
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,708
we know that that number is higher.

115
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:03,320
Binge drinking is taking a remarkable
toll on the physical and

116
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:06,867
mental health of many college
students across our country.

117
00:08:06,867 --> 00:08:11,952
And is most certainly taking a toll on
some of you and some of your peers.

118
00:08:11,952 --> 00:08:16,392
In some,
alcohol abuse is probably the biggest

119
00:08:16,392 --> 00:08:20,949
public health issue on
college campuses today.

120
00:08:20,949 --> 00:08:26,744
I want to provide one example of a policy
approach to addressing health behavior.

121
00:08:26,744 --> 00:08:31,292
Prohibition, or the 18th amendment,
passed in 1919.

122
00:08:31,292 --> 00:08:34,798
Represents a policy approach to forbid or

123
00:08:34,798 --> 00:08:38,914
outlaw engaging in
a specific health behavior.

124
00:08:38,914 --> 00:08:42,620
It was part of a moral crusade
to get rid of alcohol, and

125
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:45,854
in some respects,
it was a successful policy.

126
00:08:45,854 --> 00:08:49,768
Alcohol consumption dropped
by about two-thirds, and

127
00:08:49,768 --> 00:08:54,995
rates of liver disease dropped to half
their rate from before Prohibition.

128
00:08:54,995 --> 00:08:58,537
On the other hand, there were
a lot of unintended consequences.

129
00:08:58,537 --> 00:09:03,749
Including widespread disrespect for
the law, bootlegging,

130
00:09:03,749 --> 00:09:08,972
and a rise in organized crime,
and relatedly, more murders.

131
00:09:08,972 --> 00:09:11,907
The policy was only in effect for
about 15 years,

132
00:09:11,907 --> 00:09:14,580
when it was repealed
by the 21st amendment.

133
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:18,884
The repeal of the law was in response
to a balancing of the costs and

134
00:09:18,884 --> 00:09:20,299
benefits of the law.

135
00:09:20,299 --> 00:09:23,401
That the health effects
weren't significant enough to

136
00:09:23,401 --> 00:09:25,451
justify the disrespect for the law.

137
00:09:25,451 --> 00:09:32,354
And other negative social consequences,
like murder associated with Prohibition.

138
00:09:32,354 --> 00:09:35,553
While prohibition didn't go
the distance as a policy,

139
00:09:35,553 --> 00:09:38,411
it does give us an interesting
reference point for

140
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:41,827
how we may handle regulation
of other illicit substances.

141
00:09:41,827 --> 00:09:46,927
There are conversations in public health,
as well as political arenas,

142
00:09:46,927 --> 00:09:50,218
about the health effects
of decriminalizing or

143
00:09:50,218 --> 00:09:54,344
legalizing other substances
that are currently illegal.

144
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:59,435
Many in the public health community would
rather focus on prevention education and

145
00:09:59,435 --> 00:10:00,243
treatment.

146
00:10:00,243 --> 00:10:05,766
Rather than on prosecuting those
who are addicted to substances.

147
00:10:05,766 --> 00:10:09,132
Questions that we should be
asking ourselves include.

148
00:10:09,132 --> 00:10:14,004
Are the negative health consequences
associated with a drug because

149
00:10:14,004 --> 00:10:17,624
of the drug itself, or
because of its illegality?

150
00:10:17,624 --> 00:10:22,762
Are the benefits of creating standardized,
regulated legal substances worth

151
00:10:22,762 --> 00:10:27,605
the possible increase in use that
would be associated with legalization?

152
00:10:27,605 --> 00:10:33,395
These are important questions, for which
we do not have readily accessible answers.

153
00:10:33,395 --> 00:10:39,495
I want to highlight a little known, rarely
celebrated, public health success story.

154
00:10:39,495 --> 00:10:42,707
The significant reduction
in the number and

155
00:10:42,707 --> 00:10:47,059
rate of motor vehicle fatalities
over the past 50 years.

156
00:10:47,059 --> 00:10:53,564
There are far fewer motor vehicle deaths
today than there were in the 1960s.

157
00:10:53,564 --> 00:10:57,231
And this is especially
impressive since there are so

158
00:10:57,231 --> 00:11:01,659
many more cars on the road today
than there were 50 years ago.

159
00:11:01,659 --> 00:11:05,663
Drawing back on the ecological
model from earlier in the lecture.

160
00:11:05,663 --> 00:11:10,257
This is an instance where interventions
to reduce motor vehicle deaths were

161
00:11:10,257 --> 00:11:14,790
targeted at the policy level, and
by changing the physical environment.

162
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:20,331
One example of this is the addition of
divided highways across the nation.

163
00:11:20,331 --> 00:11:24,960
The drop in the number of deaths is not
due to individual behavior changes in

164
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,365
the way people drive.

165
00:11:26,365 --> 00:11:29,431
So again,
this is a true public health success.

166
00:11:29,431 --> 00:11:32,307
Though, as a leading killer
of children and young adults,

167
00:11:32,307 --> 00:11:38,254
this is still an important public
health issue to keep working on.

168
00:11:38,254 --> 00:11:42,840
In contrast, public health
efforts to reduce firearm related

169
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:46,483
deaths have stagnated over
the past few decades.

170
00:11:46,483 --> 00:11:51,857
Around 30,000 individuals lose their
lives annually due to gun deaths.

171
00:11:51,857 --> 00:11:57,539
About 60% of those deaths are suicides,
the remaining 40%, homicides.

172
00:11:57,539 --> 00:12:02,989
There are more than 300
million guns in the US today.

173
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:07,634
With about one out of every
three households owning one,

174
00:12:07,634 --> 00:12:10,842
or, in many cases, more than one gun.

175
00:12:10,842 --> 00:12:14,625
As has always been the case,
but especially in recent years,

176
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:16,824
with the tax on political leaders.

177
00:12:16,824 --> 00:12:21,580
In the Sandy Hook Elementary School,
and in other communities,

178
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:25,656
gun control is an extremely
divisive political issue.

179
00:12:25,656 --> 00:12:31,191
But firearms, and
specifically firearm related deaths and

180
00:12:31,191 --> 00:12:35,218
injuries, are also public health issues.

181
00:12:35,218 --> 00:12:39,956
The public health community has
failed in its efforts to meaningfully

182
00:12:39,956 --> 00:12:43,098
reduce firearm related deaths and
injuries.

183
00:12:43,098 --> 00:12:50,555
Policy solutions to reduce these
negative health consequences are needed.

184
00:12:50,555 --> 00:12:55,246
Another category of health behavior we
focus on in public health is sexual

185
00:12:55,246 --> 00:12:56,012
behavior.

186
00:12:56,012 --> 00:12:59,279
Certainly, sexual activity
has some risks with it,

187
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:04,372
including risk of sexually transmitted
infections, and unintended pregnancy.

188
00:13:04,372 --> 00:13:08,212
We know that young adults,
those 15 to 24 years old,

189
00:13:08,212 --> 00:13:12,133
only make up a quarter of
the sexually active population.

190
00:13:12,133 --> 00:13:13,714
But they account for

191
00:13:13,714 --> 00:13:19,390
50% of newly diagnosed sexually
transmitted infections, or STIs.

192
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:23,591
People in your age group have
more risky sexual practices,

193
00:13:23,591 --> 00:13:28,059
more sexual partners,
more unprotected sexual encounters.

194
00:13:28,059 --> 00:13:32,578
There are a number of deaths linked
to sexual behavior annually,

195
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:35,628
most of which are due
to HIV related deaths.

196
00:13:35,628 --> 00:13:40,971
HIV transmission and diagnosis itself
disproportionately affect young adults.

197
00:13:40,971 --> 00:13:45,920
And as you can see on the slide,
rates of infection vary greatly by age,

198
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:53,280
sex, race and ethnicity,
and sexual orientation.

199
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:57,763
The last health behavior that I want
to focus on is illicit drug use, and

200
00:13:57,763 --> 00:14:00,242
in particular, the opioid epidemic.

201
00:14:00,242 --> 00:14:05,341
Opioids refer to any class of drug
that is meant to reduce pain,

202
00:14:05,341 --> 00:14:10,263
and includes prescription drugs,
fentanyl, and heroin.

203
00:14:10,263 --> 00:14:16,222
In 2015, there were more than
33,000 deaths due to opioids,

204
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:19,162
more than any other year on record.

205
00:14:19,162 --> 00:14:25,169
This is quadruple the number of
deaths due to opioids in 1999.

206
00:14:25,169 --> 00:14:27,974
The epidemic is a national problem,

207
00:14:27,974 --> 00:14:33,052
with more than 90 people dying
every day due to opioid overdose.

208
00:14:33,052 --> 00:14:37,361
But we can also see that the epidemic
is particularly concentrated in states

209
00:14:37,361 --> 00:14:39,598
commonly referred to as the Rust Belt.

210
00:14:39,598 --> 00:14:43,250
Or Appalachia, circled on the slide.

211
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:48,208
Much media attention has been given
to the economic influences driving

212
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:49,454
usage patterns.

213
00:14:49,454 --> 00:14:54,891
The shrinking of the middle class, fewer
jobs, or jobs that pay a living wage.

214
00:14:54,891 --> 00:14:59,718
As well as environmental factors,
like fewer healthcare facilities that

215
00:14:59,718 --> 00:15:03,789
also drive overdose death rates
in these areas of the country.

216
00:15:03,789 --> 00:15:07,894
I don't have any specific insights that
I wanted to share about the epidemic.

217
00:15:07,894 --> 00:15:11,661
Other than that I think opioid use and
overdose will continue to be part of

218
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:19,067
the national, political, and public health
conversation over the coming years.
