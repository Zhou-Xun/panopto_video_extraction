00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:11,040
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: hi everyone, welcome to this recording video of going over the answers for homework for.

2
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:23,340
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: So this first question we have a table of 20 participants from a close cohort study investigators initially planned to follow each participant for 10 years and the outcome was diagnosis of tuberculosis.

3
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:33,840
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: So we have the participant number their education level at baseline whether they were diagnosed or not, and their time to diagnosis, or to their last follow up contact.

4
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:42,540
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: This first question is asking us to estimate the cumulative incidence of tuberculosis overall ignoring the values for education.

5
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:57,660
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: And so, our denominator is going to be everyone at risk, which is everyone in the study sets 20 people and five of those 20 developed tuberculosis over the course of the study and so that gives us five divided by 20.

6
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:08,400
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: For 25% in 10 years, make sure that you always include this time when you're calculating and estimating cumulative incidents.

7
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:16,200
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: This next question is asking for some conditional cumulative incidences for each case.

8
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:35,070
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: The probability of survival when each diagnosis occurred and then both the cumulative spiral proportion and the cumulative probability of TB, and that this one, we can get through the kaplan Meier formula, and so I have this table already ready to be filled out and i've.

9
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:49,620
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: ordered the the ID numbers in order of time either to diagnosis, or to loss of follow up it's a little bit easier to figure out the number censored, and the number at risk if they're organized by time.

10
00:01:49,620 --> 00:02:02,670
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: So our first case was ID number 17 that occurred at 2.28 years number event is one at this point there is zero people sensor everyone is still in the study at this point.

11
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:13,860
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: And so the number of risk is the full 20 people in the study or conditional cumulative incidence is going to be the number of events divided by the number of risk which is one divided by 20.

12
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:32,250
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: Which is 0.05 and then the conditional survival proportion at this point is the inverse of the conditional cumulative incidents so 19 divided by 20 which is 0.5 yes, not in verse but one minus the cumulative incidents.

13
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:51,390
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: And then, our cumulative survival proportion one minus the conditional cumulative incident sorry, so I can cumulative sorrow proportion at this point is just the one row which is 90 divided by 20 and so at this point it's still 0.9.

14
00:02:51,390 --> 00:03:04,380
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: Our next event is TV, yes, is it number two at a time 3.93 years so add that to the table number event is one.

15
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:12,060
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: At this point, there's zero people censored, because we have not lost me one to follow up before this point.

16
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:28,800
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: But the number at risk is going to be 20 minus this one event, and so our number at risk is 19 because we have this this ID number 17 is no longer at risk when number two became a case.

17
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:34,290
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: it's our conditional community of incidence is going to be the number of events divided by the number at risk.

18
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:55,410
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: Which is 0.05 to six conditional sparrow proportion same thing is going to be one minus the conditional cumulative incidents which is 18 over 19 and that's 0.9474 and our cumulative survival portion is going to be.

19
00:03:55,410 --> 00:04:03,180
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: Both conditional survival proportions multiplied together.

20
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:08,550
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: And that is 0.9.

21
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:14,970
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: let's see our next case is this one right here ID number 13.

22
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:19,350
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: And this case occurred at 4.84 years.

23
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:37,890
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: against one event and the number censored is going to be the number of people who we lost to follow up so that's There we have two people in this case ID number 15 and 17 who we lost a follow up before number 13 became a case and so.

24
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:53,160
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: These two people who asked to follow up and also this one person who had who was diagnosed with TB, they are no longer at risk sorry number at risk when number 13 became a case is 16 people.

25
00:04:53,160 --> 00:05:06,210
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: are conditional cumulative incidence is going to be one divided by 16 which is 0.0625 and our conditional survival proportion is going to be 15 divided by 616.

26
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:31,950
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: Which is 0.9375 and our cumulative survival proportion is going to be all three conditional survival proportions multiplied together so 19 divided by 20 times 18 divided by 19 times 15 divided by 16, and that is 0.844.

27
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:40,890
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: Our next case is ID number four right here at time 6.34 years.

28
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:49,740
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: we'll get him put that in there, that was one event and the number censored, we have one person who was last to follow up.

29
00:05:49,740 --> 00:06:00,600
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: So that's one person censored, and so our number at risk is going to subtract this event that occurred, and the one person censored.

30
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:05,460
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: Which is 14.

31
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:37,800
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: it's our conditional cumulative incidents as one divided by 14 since there were 14 people at risk, and that is 0.0714 and are conditional spiral proportion is going to be 13 divided by 14 which is 0.9286 and our cumulative certain proportion we're going to multiply those all together.

32
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:43,500
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: And that is 0.783.

33
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:53,460
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: Now our last case is this one right here ID number six this occurred 8.95 years.

34
00:06:53,460 --> 00:07:05,550
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: There was one event and we how many people censored between ID number 14 number six we have 12345678 people who are censored.

35
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:13,590
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: And so, our number at risk is me 14 minus that those eight who were censored minus this one event and that.

36
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:30,090
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: gives us five people at risk when number six became a case so conditional cumulative incidences one divided by five is 0.2 conditional survival proportions four divided by five which is 0.8.

37
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:38,850
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: And our cumulative sorrow proportion we're going to multiply again all.

38
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:47,160
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: and

39
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:52,590
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: And that gives us 0.6 to seven.

40
00:07:52,590 --> 00:08:05,610
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: And so the answers here, so our questions were asking for the conditional cumulative incidences and the conditional survival proportions, those are going to be the numbers and these two columns respectively.

41
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:17,400
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: And then, our conditional survival proportion over the whole study is 0.6 to seven and our conditional our cumulative probability of tuberculosis over the whole study.

42
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:34,140
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: is going to be 111 minus zero point 67 which is 0.373 or.

43
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:42,630
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: 37.3% over 10 years.

44
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:48,150
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: So that's this question.

45
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:53,790
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: Next, it asks us to compare the cumulative incidents estimated in a with the cumulative probability of.

46
00:08:53,790 --> 00:09:08,850
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: This estimated in be so remember the simple cumulative proportion that we estimated in a plus 25% and now here in be we estimated 37.7 point 37.3% sorry.

47
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:20,220
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: And so the simple Community portion is smaller because it assumes complete follow up and no company risks, but these assumptions are not met in the data provided so using this kaplan Meier.

48
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:33,690
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: formula we are accounting for incomplete follow up, so the simple kind of incidents underestimates the true risk because people who are no longer at risk we're continued in the nuts in the denominator.

49
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:48,030
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: And in this formula we accounted for that, and so, which one more accurately represent the risk of TV that's going to be the cumulative probability that we estimated in this table Part B.

50
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:54,780
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: question the part.

51
00:09:54,780 --> 00:10:07,260
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: next question asks us to calculate the overall rate of tuberculosis per 100 person years, so I went ahead and filled out what we want to find for a denominator is the sum of all the person time in.

52
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:22,170
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: for everyone that's in the study, so the sum of all of this time is going to be our denominators that's our total person time, and that is 140.34 years.

53
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:52,650
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: And we have five cases over this time, so the incidence rate equals five divided by 140 point three, four, which is 0.0356 and what we multiply it by 100 because it's asking for 100 person years we get 3.56 cases per 100 person years.

54
00:10:52,650 --> 00:11:08,010
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: For Part II it's asking us to estimate the rates separately, for the first five years in the second five years of follow up and to show your calculations, and so what I did is sorted the table once again.

55
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:17,940
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: In order from shorter just to longest follow up and I added these two columns I think this is an easier it's an easy way to think about it.

56
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:37,050
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: To look at what the time in the first five years for each idea is and what their time in the second five years is that we get accurate estimates of the full person time in the first five years and in the second five years, so in this first case.

57
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:49,530
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: This ID number 17 spent 2.28 years in the first five years and no time in the second five years similarly for.

58
00:11:49,530 --> 00:12:06,300
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: All of these who were in the study for less than five years, they all of their time was contributed to the first five years and they contributed no time to the second five years now, once we get greater than five we have.

59
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:12,390
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: Each person who is in the study for greater than five years contributed.

60
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:15,150
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: Five years.

61
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:38,340
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: To the first five years into their second five years we're going to subtract five from their time, so the first person contributed point one three years in the second five years of the study this person contributed 1.34 years to the second five years of study, and so on.

62
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,950
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: And we can add these.

63
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:53,970
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: Together, so the total person time in the first five years was 94.5 and the total person time in the second five years is 45.84 and so if we calculate.

64
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:59,160
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: The rates for the first.

65
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,340
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: Five years.

66
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:05,250
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: We had let's see.

67
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:13,860
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: In the first five raising in 123 cases so to me three divided by 94.5.

68
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:27,990
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: And that gives us 0.0317 which is 3.17 cases per 100 person years and second.

69
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:40,110
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: Five years we have one two cases over 45.84 years of follow up.

70
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:52,860
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: which gives us 0.0436 which is 4.36 cases per 100 person.

71
00:13:52,860 --> 00:14:00,750
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: So, based on the results, and he was it appropriate to calculate the rate per person year for the total follow up period explained in one sentence why or why not.

72
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:20,040
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: So that this rate is not constant through the follow up period, the first five years as a smaller rate than the second five years, and so it would assuming that this is not due to random variability it would not be appropriate to calculate a single rate for the total follow up.

73
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:33,360
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: What is an important assumption underlying beefs of the kaplan Meier formula and the person time approach to summarize these data, one important assumption is that sensory is an independent of survival.

74
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:40,620
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: Moving on to H tuberculosis lasts for about six years, six months and their conventional treatment assume that the rate.

75
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,980
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: Estimated and D is applicable to the population of a town.

76
00:14:43,980 --> 00:15:01,050
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: What would be the expected prevalence of tuberculosis at any given point in this population so we're going to use this formula that point prevalence is the incidence rate times disease duration divided by one plus the incidence rate times the disease duration.

77
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:06,300
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: So we.

78
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,760
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: insert.

79
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:27,120
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: out the formula for you guys, so our incidence rate we're assuming the right estimated in D is applicable, so we are using this 3.56 and we're going to go back to using point 0356 so that everything is on the scale of one year.

80
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:59,730
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: So 0.0356 multiplied by 0.5 because the disease duration is six months, and since we're doing this on the scale of one year we're going to say that's half the year we're going to divide that by one plus 0.0356 times 0.5 and that gives us 0.0175 or 1.8.

81
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:01,770
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: part is.

82
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:03,630
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: Is.

83
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:21,960
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: asking us to calculate the cumulative incidences by levels of exposure and the cumulative incidents ratio and we're assuming that education is the exposure and that low education is exposed in higher education is unexposed so in the look let's look back at our table.

84
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:37,140
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: The original table, so we have 10 low education and 10 high education and a low education group, we have 123 cases and the higher education group, we have one two cases.

85
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:45,180
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: Sorry, to make you dizzy for all the scrolling and the low education or problems is three divided by 10.

86
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:56,430
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: To 0.3 which is 30% in 10 years and higher education it's two divided by 10 which is your point two.

87
00:16:56,430 --> 00:17:15,420
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: Which is 20% in 10 years, and so our cumulative incidents ratio is going to be the Kingdom of incidents in the exposed and divided by the cumulative incidence in the unexposed that's going to be 0.3 divided by 0.2 which is 1.5.

88
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:23,460
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: If we describe this association words, we can say that there is an inverse association between education and risk of tuberculosis.

89
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:47,040
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: Because lower education is higher risk or you could also say that there is a positive association between low education and risk of tuberculosis and that the risk of TB is 1.5 times higher and people with low education, then in those with higher education over a 10 year follow up period.

90
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:55,710
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: This next question is asking assuming exchange ability what percent of tuberculosis risk among persons with low education would be attributable to their low education.

91
00:17:55,710 --> 00:18:09,360
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: So this measure of association is the access fraction or the risk fraction and the formula for that is the cumulative incident to be exposed minus the cumulative incidents in the unexposed divided by the cumulative incidents in the exposed.

92
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:19,560
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: So that's going to be 0.3 minus your point to.

93
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:29,490
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: provide them divided by 0.3 which is 0.3 33 or 33%.

94
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:40,410
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: And so, this is saying that under exchange ability 33.3% of the risk of TV among people with low education is attributable to their low education.

95
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:49,110
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: This next part assuming exchange ability what percent of TV risk would be attributable to low education and the whole cohort and, what is this measure association called.

96
00:18:49,110 --> 00:19:01,620
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: So this is the population attributable risk and the formula for this is the ci and cohort minus ci in the unexposed do I do I see I in the cohort and so if we fill out.

97
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:19,380
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: From way back in Part A, we figured out the cumulative incidents in the cohort was five divided by 10 times better by 20 sorry so five divided by 20 minus two divided by 10 since that was our.

98
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:25,740
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: cumulative incidents in the unexposed and we'll divide.

99
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:29,310
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: That whole part.

100
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:31,740
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: By five do it right.

101
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:38,460
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: And we get 0.2 or 20%.

102
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:53,190
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: And then to compare these two values and why do they differ so the population attributable risk is lower than the excess fraction because not everybody in the population is exposed.

103
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:58,200
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: Moving on to number two.

104
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:02,220
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: So in this case.

105
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:13,290
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: We are investigating so instead of education we're investigating exposure, such as wait, which can change over time and a population we're under nutrition is common so we're dealing with.

106
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:25,230
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: A time varying exposure for each year follow up, we know whether a person's underweight or not, and the table, shows the distribution of underweight were shaded is underweight so boxes that are shaded that is.

107
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:36,750
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: A year when they were exposed in cases where a marked with an axe and so here is outcome there's an x they have the outcome.

108
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:44,730
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: None of the participants who had TV when none of the participants had had TV when the study began, and there was no asked to follow up.

109
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:57,360
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: And so we want to figure out the rates of the first tuberculosis diagnosis by exposure status and the rates of all TV diagnosis by exposure status and so again.

110
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:09,150
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: To do this added columns to the table and we'll work through the first couple of rows and then fill in the rest, so we want to know.

111
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:21,780
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: How many first events we had in the expose and in the unexposed we want to know the person time to first events and the exposure and the unexposed and then we also want to know this for.

112
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:38,370
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: all events, the just number of all events and the person time for all events, and so we'll start with first so starts number one they had one first event when they were exposed.

113
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:50,760
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: And so, this is going to be a one here and their person time to expose to their first event was 123 they had no.

114
00:21:50,760 --> 00:22:02,940
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: unexposed person time before their event, they had their event in year three and so we're not going to count the rest of their follow up because we're only interested in their first event person time.

115
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:20,760
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: When when we looked at number of all events again they had just one event over the whole follow up period, but their person time exposed in total was 1234 and their person time unexposed and total was six years because of the six on shaded boxes.

116
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:32,610
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: So we can look at this next person they had no cases, so their person time to their first event, since they did not have a first event we're going to calculate all of their person time.

117
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:54,630
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: They had two years exposed and eight years unexposed and so it's the same for all events, because they did not have a first event in this case same thing, except this person number three was never exposed so they have a full 10 years unexposed in both cases.

118
00:22:54,630 --> 00:23:09,150
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: row number for this person was fully exposed the whole time but they had their first case in your number seven so they have one case and their person time to their first event was seven exposed years.

119
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:22,170
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: When we're looking at all events they had two events, it when they were exposed and person time all events they had their full 10 years they were exposed.

120
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:25,140
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: Now I feel not.

121
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,000
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: In.

122
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,590
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: For.

123
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:34,050
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: The rest and then this row I think is a little bit interesting soul work through this one.

124
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:58,110
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: So this person had their first event in your three so they have and they were exposed during this time, so they had 101 event exposed.

125
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:06,300
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: And no events they were unexposed and what we stopped counting because they had their first event the event.

126
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:11,100
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: Up until the first rent they had.

127
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,740
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: And the.

128
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:28,890
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: next person time so we're going to count all of the years, up until then, and then we're going to stop counting after the first event in this in the second case, and again just one event.

129
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:35,400
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: Time exposures three years and the total person time unexposed for seven years.

130
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:41,850
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: And so we didn't fill that in for the rest of the table i've gone ahead and fill that in.

131
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:54,420
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: For us, we are not to listen to me walk through each single one, but I hope the few that we went through are helpful and then I also calculated the totals.

132
00:24:54,420 --> 00:25:02,670
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: So we have the total first cases me exposed the total number of first cases in the unexposed we have the total number of.

133
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:14,250
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: person is exposed until the first case and the total number of person time person years unexposed until the first case, we have a total number of cases exposed.

134
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:24,840
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: And the total number of cases and the unexposed and then we also have the total amount of person time for both the exposed any unexposed.

135
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:50,700
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: So for calculating the rates first to TV diagnosis we're going to use this first block here, and so on the there were eight cases in the exposed and 96 person years and so that 0.0833 which is 8.33 cases per 100 person years.

136
00:25:50,700 --> 00:26:04,860
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: The incidence rate in the unexposed is the seven cases divided by 233 person years which gives us 0.03 which is three cases per one.

137
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:18,180
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: person years the incidence rate difference will be the exposed minus the unexposed 8.33 minus three.

138
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:36,300
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: which gives us 5.33 cases per 100 person years, and since we're subtracting will keep the units, because the units don't cancel out been the incidence rate ratio where we're dividing the exposed over the unexposed.

139
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:50,100
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: To get 2.77 the units will cancel out, so this is simply just 2.77 we can describe the Association for Part B, by saying that there is a positive association between underweight and tuberculosis.

140
00:26:50,100 --> 00:27:00,810
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: or an inverse association between body weight and tuberculosis, because lower body weight has higher rates of tuberculosis.

141
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:11,040
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: The incidence of tuberculosis among underweight persons is 5.33 person years 5.33 per 100 person years in excess of that among non underweight.

142
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:22,440
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: Or we could also say that the incidence of tuberculosis among underweight persons is 2.77 times higher and underweight people compared to those who are not under your weight.

143
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:40,380
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: Part see where we want to estimate the rates of all tuberculosis diagnoses by exposure status, so this is we're looking at all cases, so this is these last four boxes here, so we had nine cases and we exposed over 115 total person uses.

144
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:52,200
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: With she gives us 0.783 which is 7.83 cases per 100 person years.

145
00:27:52,200 --> 00:28:16,890
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: And then, in the unexposed we had eight cases over 285 total years unexposed just 0.0281 which gives us 2.81 cases per 100 person years and we can do the same thing in the incidence rate difference that will do the expose minus the unexposed so we'll do 7.83.

146
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:20,490
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: minus.

147
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:23,340
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: 2.1 sorry.

148
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:35,820
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: Do you have this 5.02 cases her 100 person years and then the ratio will divide those two.

149
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:40,500
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: And that gives us 2.7 nothing.

150
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:46,290
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: So that's the end of the kind of main portion of the homework.

151
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:49,530
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: When are moving on to the extra credit.

152
00:28:49,530 --> 00:29:01,560
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: So, in the discussion section of this paper, the author, say, although the effect of maternal obesity on cerebral palsy may seem small compared with other risk factors, the association is of public health relevance.

153
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:05,880
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: Due to the large proportion of women with overweight or obesity worldwide.

154
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:18,510
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: So in this case, they were referring to the population attributable risk because they're referring to the risk of disease and the whole population that is attributable to be exposure and they're also looking at the prevalence.

155
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:26,010
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: of obesity and this of course population of trivial risk changes with prevalence.

156
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:29,610
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: Of the.

157
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:39,930
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: next question is asking what is not true, about the study, so in this case there's evidence philosophy follow this is not true, about the study, because they say that the.

158
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:49,740
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: Children are followed until diagnosis of cerebral palsy death or end a follow up and the US National registry, so there is no evidence for loss of follow up.

159
00:29:49,740 --> 00:30:01,980
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: going to go ahead and pause the recording and bring up the paper for these next calculations.

160
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:13,800
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: Okay, so I pulled up the article, the table that we're interested in for number three is table two so number three we're looking at low birth weight.

161
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:21,690
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: And as a dichotomous variable and it's defined as birth weight less than 202,500 grams.

162
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:38,940
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: Until this first part wants us to calculate the incidence rate ratio for cerebral palsy comparing children with low birth weight with those known to have been born without low birth weight and so in this table in this case for incidence rate ratio, we want we're curious about.

163
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:51,240
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: The numbers that we need is the number of cerebral palsy cases and then child years of follow up and we want that, in this we're looking at this category birth weight.

164
00:30:51,240 --> 00:31:05,580
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: And so the incidence rate and the low birth weight there's only one category for a low birth weight, since its defined is less than 2500 so this one category there 801 cases of cerebral palsy.

165
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:27,930
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: Over 335,297 year child years of follow up so those two numbers are right here, and if we use the cases as our numerator and the total child years of follow up as our denominator, we get the incidence rate is point 002389 in the low birth weight group.

166
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:37,230
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: We can do the same thing in the non low birth weight, except now we're looking at each one of these groups.

167
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:53,760
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: there's five groups here, because all of these were greater than 2500 grid or equal to 2500 grams at birth, so all of these categories are non low birth weight categories.

168
00:31:53,760 --> 00:32:05,970
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: And, but we're still looking at the number of cerebral palsy cases and the total child years of follow up and so we're just going to add together all of the cerebral palsy cases in the in.

169
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:16,260
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: Among the groups and we're going to add together all of the trial years of follow up and we can see that here that here's our numerator that's all of those these cerebral palsy cases.

170
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:33,090
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: And this is our denominator, and this is all of the challenges of follow up added together, and that gives us incidence rate of point 000193 are incidence rate ratio is.

171
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:45,150
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: going to be the incidence rate and the exposed divided by the incidence rate in the unexposed and that's 12.4, so there is a positive association between low birth weight and incidence rate of cerebral palsy.

172
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:51,510
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: The rate in those low birth weight is 12 times, the rate in those of non low birth weight.

173
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:59,670
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: Similarly, we can calculate the cumulative incidence ratio for cerebral palsy comparing the same groups, as in Part A.

174
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:06,180
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: And so we're still interested in the number of cerebral palsy cases as our denominator split between.

175
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:17,850
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: Low birth weight and non low birth weight, but this time since we're calculating the cumulative incidents or denominator is going to be the total number of children so that's going to be the first column here.

176
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:38,940
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: And so, in the low birth weight group, we have for the 3796 no children in this group, and so this is our denominator and numerator is still gonna be 801 cerebral palsy cases and that gives us a cumulative incidence of point oh 183 over the meeting follow up time.

177
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:49,920
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: And then the cumulative incidents and the non low birth weight has the same denominator, as the incidence rate up here just all the number of cases and then are.

178
00:33:49,920 --> 00:34:00,480
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: Sorry, the same numerator and then our denominator is going to be all of the number of children in each group added together.

179
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:16,800
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: And that gives us point 00156 of over immediate follow up time and incidents ratio is going to be the cumulative incidents in the exposed divided by the cumulative incidents and the unexposed which is 11.74.

180
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:31,470
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: So, again there's a positive association between low birth weight and risk of cerebral palsy committed incidents and those with low birth weight is 11.7 times that in those of non low birth weight over in a follow up period.

181
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:34,050
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: For part four.

182
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:47,640
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: We are looking at preterm delivery as a dichotomous variable defined as birth before 37 complete weeks of just station is defined as preterm.

183
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:55,140
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: And so we're using data presented in table for of the paper in this case.

184
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:59,880
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: Serious table for.

185
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:05,700
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: um we're looking at.

186
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:14,820
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: The incidence of preterm delivery among different levels of pride early pregnancy maternal BMI because we're curious about the association between.

187
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:29,400
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: Early pregnancy BMI and incidence of preterm delivery, and so we this when going to disregard this missing categories so i'm just going to scoot the table over so we can see the full thing on the screen.

188
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:33,840
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: And so I created this table here that hopefully it helps.

189
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:37,560
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: and divided by each.

190
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:47,190
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: group of early pregnancy BMI as we can see they've divided up into six different groups and so we've just taken those six groups and they've chosen.

191
00:35:47,190 --> 00:36:02,340
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: And we're interested in the incidence of preterm delivery, so this first grouping, this is term delivery, and so we don't need these numbers up here the numbers that we want our.

192
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:16,440
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: moderately preterm delivery very preterm delivery and extremely preterm delivery, because all of these were delivery before 37 weeks, which is what we defined our as.

193
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:26,310
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: Our outcome preacher delivery, this is how we define your outcome, and so we want to know the incidence and so in this case different from part three, where we were looking at.

194
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:38,490
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: cerebral palsy cases we're not looking at cerebral palsy cases in this problem we're looking at the number of children who were born preterm.

195
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:44,250
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: And so, in this first category where maternal BMI is less than 18.5.

196
00:36:44,250 --> 00:37:06,870
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: And the moderately preterm delivery group 1694 children were born moderately preterm 136 children were born very preterm and 58 children were born extremely preterm so this those added together Those are our number of preterm children Those are our cases.

197
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:20,430
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: Because we've defined our outcome as preterm delivery, so these we have had we have 1888 preterm deliveries in this less than 18.5 maternal BMI category.

198
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:35,220
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: And since we're looking at cumulative incidence our denominator is going to be the total births and so again it's going to be this 58 plus 136 plus 1694 and then we're also going to include this.

199
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:43,950
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: Since this is the total number of children who were born to mothers in number eternal BMI category less than 18.5.

200
00:37:43,950 --> 00:38:02,700
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: And so out of the total number of children who are born to mothers in this category, how many were preterm and so that's why we're looking at these three among the total and so if we divide 1888 divided by.

201
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:13,770
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: We get a cumulative incidence of point 062 and then we can do that for each.

202
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:21,510
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: category of early pregnancy BMI.

203
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:27,090
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: In a similar way.

204
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:40,950
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: As we did for the first one, and so we're looking at the number of children who are born preterm over the total number of children who are born in that category and we'll we'll do that for each group.

205
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:45,330
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: And so we can get cumulative incidences for each group.

206
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:51,510
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: And with that we can get the cumulative incidents ratios.

207
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:56,520
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: For each group.

208
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:02,130
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: And so, if we have our cumulative incidents ratios here we can see that there's.

209
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:22,800
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: A U shaped association between early pregnancy maternal BMI and preterm delivery since here at the low end of BMI we have high incidence and then it sort of decreases but then it increases once again when we get to higher BMI.

210
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:33,360
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: So that's a u shaped Association, the cumin of incidence of preterm delivery and the lowest maternal group is higher.

211
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:41,670
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: than that and the groups with the maternal BMI 18.5 all the way through 35 4.9.

212
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:52,440
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: And then within this range it's cumulative incidences higher in these groups or it's increasing as BMI increases.

213
00:39:52,440 --> 00:40:07,320
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: And then, when maternal BMI is greater than 35 These two values are greater than this less than 18.5 so this kind of creates a u shaped association.

214
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:23,456
Brittney Anne Van Der Woude: So that is the whole homework, I hope this was helpful if you have any questions feel free to email any of the teaching team or come to our office hours.
