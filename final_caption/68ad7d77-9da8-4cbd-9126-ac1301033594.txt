1
00:00:10,319 --> 00:00:15,319
Epidemiology, at least the analytic arm of epidemiology, is concerned with identifying causes

2
00:00:15,319 --> 00:00:20,319
of health and disease outcomes. In order to inform effective and equitable public health interventions

3
00:00:20,319 --> 00:00:26,319
to improve them. First, we must agree on a definition of what is a cause.

4
00:00:26,319 --> 00:00:32,319
Rothman, in the Modern Epidemiology textbook, defines a cause as an antecedent event, condition

5
00:00:32,319 --> 00:00:37,319
or characteristic that was necessary for the occurrence of the disease. At the moment it occurred,

6
00:00:37,319 --> 00:00:42,319
given that all other characteristics are fixed. Now there are three very important parts to

7
00:00:42,319 --> 00:00:47,319
this definition. First is the use of the word antecedent. This implies that timing or

8
00:00:47,319 --> 00:00:52,319
temporal ordering of the cause preceding the disease outcome

9
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:58,319
of interest is fundamentally important. Second is the use of the word necessary.

10
00:00:58,319 --> 00:01:03,319
The cause must be present in order for the disease to occur. If the cause is not

11
00:01:03,319 --> 00:01:09,319
present and the disease occurred, then it may not be a cause. And finally,

12
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:14,319
given that all other characteristics are fixed, is an important final part of this definition.

13
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:19,319
We must be confident that other potential, unmeasured common

14
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:25,319
causes of the cause and question and the disease outcome of interest

15
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:30,319
are not affecting the association that we are observing between the cause and question and the disease

16
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:35,319
outcome of interest. This may feel a little bit confusing now. This means this

17
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:40,319
refers to confounding and we will get into this shortly. In the course. So don't

18
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:45,319
worry if it feels confusing right now. Lazarsfeld

19
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:50,319
in 1959 gave three criteria for causation in epidemiology,

20
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:55,319
criteria for causation have been a major subject of focus and debate over

21
00:01:55,319 --> 00:02:00,319
the years and they continue to be today. There are additional criteria for causation.

22
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:05,319
Different people use different frameworks for causation. In this course, we're going to get into four

23
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:11,319
very commonly used frameworks for causation. But I would say that these three criteria

24
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:16,319
are unarguable and form sort of a bedrock foundation

25
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:21,319
for thinking about causation and epidemiology. So first, a causal relationship

26
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:27,319
between two variables must have a temporal order in which the cause must proceed, the effect

27
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:32,319
in time. And this is readily intuitive that we this is part of this forms part of our understanding

28
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:37,319
of how the world works. And we use this idea of causation every day as we go about our lives.

29
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:42,319
So, for example, if A is A cause and B as an effect, then A must occur before B. This

30
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:48,319
is unquestionable. Second, the two variables. So the cause under study

31
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:53,319
and the affect or outcome under study should be empirically correlated with one another. So if

32
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:58,319
we have a data set and we look at the frequency of the outcome or effect

33
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:03,319
with in relation to the frequency of the cause, then we should see that as the cause increases

34
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:09,319
in frequency, we should see the effect or outcome. Similarly, increases in frequency

35
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:14,319
and this observed empirical correlation between two variables cannot be explained away as

36
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:20,319
the result of a third variable or a common cause of both A and B. In

37
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:25,319
other words, the relationship is not serious and occurs regularly. When this does happen, we

38
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:30,319
call it confounding. A good example is the relationship

39
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:35,319
between heavy coffee intake and risk of heart attack.

40
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:41,319
If we do a study and we and we observe that there is an increased frequency

41
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:46,319
of heart attacks among people who are extremely heavy coffee drinkers and we don't

42
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:51,319
account for any other characteristics. It may be confounded. A primary

43
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:56,319
confounder of this relationship could be smoking. So smokers may be more likely

44
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:01,319
to have heavy coffee intake and also more likely to have

45
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:06,319
a heart attack. And so the relationship that we may observe between heavy coffee intake

46
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:12,319
and heart attack may, in fact, be spurious as a result of coffee. Sorry,

47
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:18,319
smoking being related to both heavy coffee intake and heart attack.

48
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:23,319
We will talk about confounding in more detail later on in the course.

49
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:28,319
In epidemiology, we take a probabilistic approach to understanding causation.

50
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:34,319
And this is because we work in populations. So when we think about causation

51
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:39,319
from a philosophical or theoretical perspective, it is a deterministic concept,

52
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:44,319
right? A cause happens and then the outcome occurs. And so this

53
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:49,319
did very deterministic concept of causation. At a philosophical level

54
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:55,319
is supplemented with or replaced by probabilistic methods in epidemiology.

55
00:04:55,319 --> 00:05:00,319
So rather than demonstrating causality in individuals, meaning demonstrating

56
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:05,319
the causality of an individual person's incidents or occurrence of

57
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:11,319
a disease outcome, we make causal inferences about a hypothesized relationship

58
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:16,319
between a given exposure and a disease in a particular population. When thinking about

59
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:23,319
the frequencies or the probability of the exposure and disease occurring in that population.

60
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:28,319
So from a pop probabilistic perspective, the exposure X

61
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:33,319
leads to a distribution of possible outcomes in a population, or we think

62
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:38,319
about this with a percent probability or a risk that an outcome will occur in

63
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:43,319
a population with a given exposure prevalence. And this is

64
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:48,319
sort of in contrast to a deterministic perspective on causality, which just

65
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:54,319
says X leads to an outcome.

66
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:59,319
And so does thinking in terms of probability of outcomes mean it's the end of the deterministic

67
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:05,319
world? Can we ever determine real, true causality when we think in terms of probabilities?

68
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:10,319
And this isn't this is not necessarily the case. We can still adhere to the

69
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:16,319
view or the idea that disease occurrence is completely determined by a set of factors.

70
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:21,319
And this is still true for an outcome to have occurred. There must have been some cause or set of

71
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:26,319
causes that happened, but we may not know or we may not be able to measure all of the factors.

72
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:32,319
And this partly relates to the idea that most disease outcomes have a multifactorial

73
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:38,319
etiology, meaning there are multiple different sets of causes that can lead to an individual

74
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:43,319
case of disease. Let's take example. Let's take, for example, breast

75
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:48,319
cancer. We know that there are many different causes of breast cancer, for example.

76
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:53,319
One given woman may experience a breast cancer diagnosis because she has inherited

77
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:58,319
the BRCA gene, which increases her genetic risk. Another woman may experience an increased

78
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:04,319
risk of breast cancer due to an environmental exposure. Both of these things are causes,

79
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:09,319
but they are expressed in different ways in the population. And we would see a different frequency

80
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:14,319
of breast cancer associated with that specific cause at the population level. Even

81
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:22,319
though the causes, the deterministic causes at the individual level are different.

82
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:27,319
We can understand causes at the population level when we think about causal

83
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:33,319
types at the individual level. So there are four causal types.

84
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:38,319
They're showing in much better on the next slide. But really briefly, they are those who are doomed where the

85
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:43,319
disease occurs with or without the exposure. They are effect causative where the disease

86
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:48,319
occurs. If and only if the person is exposed, they are. The third is effect preventive

87
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:53,319
where the disease occurs. If and only if the person is unexposed and immune, where the disease

88
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:58,319
does not occur with or without the exposure. So populations consist of individuals

89
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:04,319
of all four causal types, and we need to look at the frequencies of these causal types.

90
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:09,319
To better understand the probability that a disease outcome will occur when there is

91
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:14,319
a specific exposure present. So this is the slide that I think is most helpful here in

92
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:19,319
understanding the four causal types. With respect to the disease

93
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:24,319
outcomes that may occur. So here, the exposure has an effect on the disease

94
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:30,319
and types two and three, but not types one in four. And we cannot directly observe

95
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:35,319
these types of individuals within the population because we cannot observe both

96
00:08:35,319 --> 00:08:40,319
exposure states simultaneously in the same individual. So if we have an individual

97
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:45,319
in our population who is a type one and if they are exposed and they become

98
00:08:45,319 --> 00:08:50,319
exposed and they become a case, we actually can't go back in time and find out

99
00:08:50,319 --> 00:08:55,319
what would have happened to them if they were not exposed. Because we because that one

100
00:08:55,319 --> 00:09:00,319
exposure condition where they did not receive the exposure is counterfactual. That is

101
00:09:00,319 --> 00:09:06,319
it is counter to the fact of what actually happened. Maybe this is a more way clear

102
00:09:06,319 --> 00:09:11,319
way to explain it. If we observe an expose person who becomes a case, we cannot determine whether

103
00:09:11,319 --> 00:09:16,319
he or she is a type one or take two. Similarly, if we observe an unexposed person

104
00:09:16,319 --> 00:09:21,319
who becomes a case, we cannot determine whether he or she is a type one or type three.

105
00:09:21,319 --> 00:09:26,319
Similarly, now, let's think up to the population level. If we observe a certain proportion

106
00:09:26,319 --> 00:09:32,319
of exposed persons at risk of developing a disease in a population, we cannot say how many of them,

107
00:09:32,319 --> 00:09:38,319
if any, were definitely caused by the exposure. We can simply look at the disease frequencies

108
00:09:38,319 --> 00:09:45,319
that occur in association with a given exposure.

109
00:09:45,319 --> 00:09:50,319
So to build on this, we use four different frameworks for causal inference that we will discuss in this course.

110
00:09:50,319 --> 00:09:56,319
These are the sufficient component cores model otherwise known as Rothman's causal PIs,

111
00:09:56,319 --> 00:10:01,319
Bradford Hills viewpoints or criteria as they are also known. They can tell the

112
00:10:01,319 --> 00:10:07,319
story, the counterfactual or potential outcomes framework and directed acyclic graphs or DAGS.

113
00:10:07,319 --> 00:10:13,319
It's useful to use these different models of causation because each has its own strengths as well as limitations

114
00:10:13,319 --> 00:10:18,319
and helps us to understand different epidemiologic concepts. That's the end of part one.

115
00:10:18,319 --> 00:10:23,319
The next is part two, where we will introduce C sufficient component cause model and Bradford Hills

116
00:10:23,319 --> 00:10:24,200
viewpoints.
