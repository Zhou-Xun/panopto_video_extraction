1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:06,390
Okay, so that is one announcement and so everyone can in your home.

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:14,350
Okay. All right. So after we go over this, um, okay.

3
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:19,850
And then we will talk about the. The paper. So the last week.

4
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:28,580
So we go over, um, you know, it's a statistical approach depending on variable characteristics,

5
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:35,280
mainly the, when the variable is continuous or it is category like a binary.

6
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,900
So then depending on the that characteristic, you choose the right statistical approach.

7
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:47,080
So this is very important. So hopefully that exercise was helpful for,

8
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:55,500
for you to review the statistical approach you learned from previous classes and then throughout this course.

9
00:00:55,650 --> 00:01:00,120
So we will go over each statistical approach one by one starting from today.

10
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:11,190
Okay. And another example, uh, this self-assessment piece that I want to also review is whether or not you are able to,

11
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,350
you know, when you look at the output and then you are able to interpret this output,

12
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:24,720
so simple linear regression, that's not just a simple, it's a multiple linear regression and the beta coefficient and how to interpret that.

13
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:35,090
And then, you know, when you do the any significance testing and then we most often use this calculating 95 confidence interval.

14
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,160
So whether or not you are able to do that.

15
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:46,830
And then the next question is when your cosine is evaluating the effect of modification and then from the output,

16
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:52,920
you are able to get the right number to calculate effect in each group.

17
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,670
Okay, so let's do this together.

18
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:00,930
So I want to give you a quick 30 seconds.

19
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:05,520
So why don't you write down a regression model from this output?

20
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:14,010
Don't think about the covariate focus on let BP b is allowed the variable and the

21
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:20,500
sex in this case the female and that interaction only using those three variable.

22
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:28,500
And then you can just simply say plus covariate closely over but write down this smaller outcome is.

23
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:36,040
I think outcome is a lot of pressure, right? Yeah, a lot of pressure.

24
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:46,440
How come? His blood pressure? Come into, let's say, SVP systolic blood pressure.

25
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:51,900
So you can just simply use SBP and this is the output outcome.

26
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:59,220
And then using this output numbers and the right write out regression equation.

27
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:28,330
Yes. Okay.

28
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:32,100
So then let's check this together.

29
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:35,530
So then I'll come. Is SVP.

30
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:47,110
So we can also put some you know subscript this I to indicate each individual but let me just skip that part and then,

31
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:52,600
you know, this is a linear regression model, so that's why we need intrastat.

32
00:04:53,560 --> 00:05:03,160
So we typically use this beta. So that's why the beta zero plus beta one PPV a lot lower.

33
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:07,450
The P B is a like a chemical symbol for let.

34
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:12,710
Plus we are two female.

35
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:25,920
Last year, three female. Times B PD plus covariate.

36
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:32,739
Right. So this is the regression border. So that's why just get the number from the output.

37
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:38,170
So 83.9 plus point ones.

38
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,740
166 APB.

39
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,970
Plus actually -5.16.

40
00:05:49,490 --> 00:06:03,550
We may just simply say F and then plus point three, three five, three times EPB plus covariance.

41
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,410
Right. Okay. So then the question is,

42
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:18,580
what is the effect as to me and I if I confidence in cover for you need increase that's one you need increase in blood alert among men.

43
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:28,330
What is it? 6.16.

44
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:40,890
.16. Right? So this is because now this female variable is coded as if this is one female.

45
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:49,090
Zero. Mayor. Right. So that's why this person is only among mayor.

46
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:56,030
So that's why you are incorporating that. Now, this variable is when mayor.

47
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:01,830
So that's why the female variable. Equal to zero.

48
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,450
So that's why all this FEMA, this component.

49
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:11,370
Gone, Interstellar gone. Right.

50
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:24,190
The only remaining part is SVP a quarter 80 39.16.166 APB.

51
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:31,840
Okay. So that's why this is. Regression model for mayor.

52
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:38,090
Okay. Which means that on average.

53
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:42,220
So how anyone can interpret this number.

54
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:46,930
So this equation. What does 8080 3.9 mean?

55
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:51,290
And what does this put in? One six 6 million.

56
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:58,070
What does this mean? Intersect. What is it?

57
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:10,180
Anything for a name is the pressure cooker maelstrom of bloodletting, level of serial.

58
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:16,050
So when the whole bit equal to zero, all the very put to zero.

59
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:22,900
And in this case even though we actually we have covariate but just just want us even though with that power.

60
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:38,890
So when BP be equal to zero right. Expected the value or mean so the mean systolic blood pressure given below the ladder level equal to zero is 83.9.

61
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,070
Right. So that's why the location is here.

62
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:51,760
And then so that's why we will say that .166.

63
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:58,400
The middle meter of a mercury.

64
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:01,870
So this is a unit of SBP, right.

65
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:09,090
Per. You need increase one microgram per deciliter increase.

66
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:15,010
In another little level. In May.

67
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,870
Right. What a one night by confidence interval.

68
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:35,250
How can you capture a 95 confidence interval? Now if I had confidence in Carver.

69
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:52,810
The. We are using reach number one, one, six, six, plus or minus three, and we are using this and then this number, right.

70
00:09:53,370 --> 00:10:05,340
So that when I if I confidence interval is .16 is plus -1.96 times the standard error is .09.

71
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:09,720
Right. So I will not calculate this part.

72
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:14,350
So you can do that. Okay. All right.

73
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:21,850
Well, then the next question is, how about for an interquartile range, which is three microgram per deciliter?

74
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:25,720
So this is for a one unit.

75
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:33,040
So one microgram per deciliter increase. What about if below the level level increase, three unit, not one unit.

76
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:41,040
How? How can we calculate? Those say someone else.

77
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:45,030
Just multiply by three. Multiply by three.

78
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:57,140
So that's why multiply two this number is the effect to estimate 2.166 times three four over nine by confidence interval.

79
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:07,190
Estimated it lost three in an hour.

80
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:12,050
So the entire part times three.

81
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:17,120
Okay. So this is knife confidence. Okay.

82
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,560
So that's why. So this is what?

83
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:25,720
This class. We will do this exercise. Okay.

84
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:29,540
And then later we will do more.

85
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,450
Like a using the code, not just using the number.

86
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:43,770
So but you should be able to like after you write your court and then later you will only get the calculated number.

87
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:51,730
But if you are not able to know how this number was derived, then you are not able to interpret that number.

88
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:54,900
So that's why you have to understand this, right? Okay.

89
00:11:55,140 --> 00:12:02,320
So the next part is for female. Okay.

90
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:08,170
So let me. So again, SVP, I put the data zero.

91
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:28,300
So let me just write for 83 nine plus .16 6pb -5.16 B man plus .335 female times BPP.

92
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:35,940
Okay for female. So then we plug in now every pore.

93
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:42,030
So this is why. When? This is one.

94
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:51,030
So this variable is dichotomous variable, a dummy variable where always it is coded as zero or one.

95
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:56,550
So that's why when this F female variable were equal to one.

96
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:02,080
So that's why you plug in this one here. Log in, one here.

97
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:19,130
Then what is the intercept of female? EV after you plug in one here this become.

98
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:25,360
Constable. Right. So that's why now you have a new Intersect.

99
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:34,730
You have a different intercept coffeemaker, which is 83.9 -5.16.

100
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:39,620
So this is New Intercept for female pro clause.

101
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:45,050
Now, this is also one. So that's why this is which top.

102
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:51,040
So this is below the level part. So that's why you are combining these two.

103
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:59,470
So that's 5.166 plus .335 BPP.

104
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:04,580
So this is a regression model for female.

105
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:11,420
Right. So that's why subtract five.

106
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:18,980
78.7 something right across.

107
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:24,520
This is polling for about five, right?

108
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:31,060
The people. So this is new Mulder.

109
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:39,790
They're regressions, Mulder. Right. What about in on the cut by rains increase.

110
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:48,630
Then how can we calculate this? This is for.

111
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:53,740
For one unit, one micrograms per deciliter increase.

112
00:14:54,460 --> 00:15:00,110
So that's a443 unit increase. Multiply by three.

113
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:05,480
So that's why you multiply all this power by three.

114
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,310
So that's what effect. Now here is the effect here.

115
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:16,690
So that's about 1.5. Mm.

116
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:20,010
Mercury increase.

117
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,990
Four three micrograms per deciliter increase.

118
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:42,589
And lot of people, right? The reason why I as not to compute night by confidence interval is that because confidence interval

119
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:50,600
calculation that you have to use how many standard error you have to use standard error on up here.

120
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:55,580
Standard error from here. Standard error from here. So you have to combine there.

121
00:15:55,850 --> 00:16:00,070
And then later I to talk about how to how to combine to stand out there.

122
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:05,090
So better question, you can just simply sum those two.

123
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:09,230
But standard error, you should not simply add to those two.

124
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:19,730
Hey. So then what is what is your conclusion on the effect the modification of the association between floodlight and SBP by gender.

125
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,430
So which come, which parameter we have to look at out of this?

126
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:31,180
Which parameter will we have to look at to make that decision?

127
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:40,680
Which one? The bottom line. Which one?

128
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:46,210
P-value. Right. So this indicates.

129
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:51,850
So what those what these p value mean. So what is your conclusion?

130
00:16:53,960 --> 00:17:02,120
For something say. Very significant direction.

131
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:11,510
So significant interaction. But what does significant interaction mean in this case?

132
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:19,790
I was looking for female and male versus outside.

133
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:24,900
Pressure is different. The slope is different.

134
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:32,040
Right. So slow. They promise that this floor B is the effect of blood lab on systolic blood pressure.

135
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:38,710
Right. So that's why I put another pressure. So below the level effect on systolic blood pressure.

136
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,590
Significantly different between male and female.

137
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:51,490
So what was the effect for Mare? It was .166.

138
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:57,380
What is the effect in filming at this point?

139
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:02,060
FI So that's why if we are making plot.

140
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:07,220
So this is pilot led. This is systolic blood pressure.

141
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:11,680
Then you can. Is that for mayor?

142
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:19,280
The slope is about this. .1664 female.

143
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:27,110
They are slow, but because they're so interested, it's smaller than men.

144
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:31,430
So that's a location of interest for female is not upper.

145
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:36,790
It is lower right here, but steeper slope.

146
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:42,650
So that's why they are slow slovis this. This is point five.

147
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:51,480
Okay. So that's the difference between those two, which is point three to be applied.

148
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:56,780
This is captured by this interaction. Okay.

149
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:01,230
So the interaction means that in linear regression model.

150
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:08,550
So additive interaction, Tom, is the difference in the effect.

151
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:13,750
So how can we interpret this? So this is difference.

152
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:21,550
In fact. Okay.

153
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:28,190
So this shouldn't be new to you.

154
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:37,710
Right. So this is the minimum. Like a prerequisite that I.

155
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:45,690
I think you have to have. Right. And then we will even though we were do this exercise throughout this class.

156
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:51,930
But you have to make sure that so. And actually, even though you are struggling right now, it's fine.

157
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:56,520
So we will do this exercise throughout this class all the time.

158
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:02,430
Okay. And then whenever I ask you, write down the equation, okay?

159
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:07,020
So take some, you know, any notes and then try, okay.

160
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:19,110
So whenever you do your own research again, so if you are not writing your equation, you are not able to understand what you are doing.

161
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,560
Okay. So all the time try this.

162
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:29,590
Okay. And then try to understand what output I am looking at right now, what this number mean.

163
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:38,920
How can we interpret these numbers? Okay. And your question about this question, so tone is fine.

164
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:47,520
Okay. So this is very early stage. So that's why this is a warning upstairs and any caution, don't hesitate.

165
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:52,200
Just raise your hand. Okay. And you're concerned about this.

166
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,900
So this is no big deal, right? Okay.

167
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:07,359
All right, let's move to the next part and then I will upload.

168
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,570
It is annotated slide to the canvas.

169
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:19,330
So I already posted the the MLK slide the last way, but because today I also added some additional one.

170
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:24,430
So I will after the class I will post this. So it's fun.

171
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:29,050
And also, in case you have to miss the class, so don't worry.

172
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:33,670
So everything will be on the like on the campus.

173
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:47,080
Okay. All right. And then next one that I want to review is so so as I mentioned last week, so that throughout this class,

174
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:54,420
during the class time, we will look at plot, land, the lover and the plot of pressure and hypertension.

175
00:21:54,430 --> 00:22:01,270
So that's the exemplar research question that we will do during the class time.

176
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:09,550
The for your homework you will be looking at is arsenic and type two diabetes.

177
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:13,670
Okay. So how was this paper?

178
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:17,690
Did you enjoy this paper? Interesting.

179
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:22,170
Right. So what did you find most interesting?

180
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:29,960
Let's let's discuss this. Selling seafood into his family.

181
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:36,800
Very interesting seafood. So then what the what how they did and what they found.

182
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:45,820
Yeah, I think they did like a 24 hour recall and they used that and all obviously.

183
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:51,590
And then also the questions and then what they found.

184
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:55,400
So in terms of the confounder you just mentioned, so you've found confounding.

185
00:22:55,400 --> 00:23:03,830
It's interesting. And the seafood intake is a confounder. So then what happened after controlling for or considering this confounding in this study?

186
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:13,740
Did find some company there. Oh, yeah, yeah.

187
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:22,290
So the confounding means that so without consideration of that specific variable, you are not able to make a proper inference.

188
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:30,030
Right. Which means that you don't get the right or valid effect to estimate from your research.

189
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:37,770
Look at your regression output. But after you are putting this into your mother and then you can get the right number.

190
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:41,510
Okay. Okay. Um.

191
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:49,599
Anyone else? Anyone want to add more? I am surprised that they are composing like those variables.

192
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:56,070
Interesting. But I like the part that they use the three models to adjust for it.

193
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,860
Different parts of components that does that. And it's like.

194
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:09,730
That's. Yeah. It's like when we do our research, we usually take all cupholders in one model and they like, they separate them,

195
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:19,750
have different categorization, like the traditional risk factors for diabetes and some potential risk factors and also the same for intake.

196
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:23,390
So that's like really interesting. That's good.

197
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:23,800
Right?

198
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:34,390
So that's why so that that is another a good strategy when you do, you know, our own research and and then let's say it is, you know everyone agree.

199
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:39,010
So that's why you know, this is a priority confounding.

200
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:45,849
So no matter I am analyzing or you are analyzing, you know, we will get the same model, right?

201
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:51,700
So that are putting this confounding everyone can agree but some other confounder or potential confounder,

202
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:56,700
we typically say that we are not sure if this is a confounder or not.

203
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,010
Right.

204
00:24:57,370 --> 00:25:10,840
So that's why then like as an author or researcher, we want to show to persuade our audience that you know how much the effect estimate changed.

205
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:18,460
We then without including this very over. So that's why we can say the adjustment for this variable is so important.

206
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:26,410
Right. But that is the way in the way that approach is to show how much a beta question is.

207
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:31,300
It's changing. But more important thing is that.

208
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:40,240
What is the knowledge about confounding and to why this group consider safe for the intake is as a confounder.

209
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:47,200
Anyone can discuss why this group considered seafood intake is a confounder.

210
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:53,629
Because seafood is a source of organic arsenic, which should be nontoxic.

211
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:57,200
So they're only interested in the inorganic component.

212
00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:05,270
Yeah. So now. So. So you talk about the relationship between compound and exploiter.

213
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:09,120
That's not a definition of confounder.

214
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:12,660
So then to fulfill confounder, then what?

215
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:19,020
Let's say for the intake should be and then also associated with diet should be also associated with the diet.

216
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:27,900
So then generally, do we know that this consumption, if for the intake is a can impaired the risk of diabetes.

217
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:37,490
Not in this class. Right. But generally, generally seafood fish consumption is good food.

218
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:44,800
Right. So that's why we generally underst understand that's a sin for the consumption is good for our heart,

219
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:49,590
not only, you know, cardiovascular disease, but also like a glucose metabolism.

220
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:58,270
Right. So that's why I sit for the intake will be a good for your glucose control and that's why but not only our general understanding,

221
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,260
but also if you look at the literature,

222
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:11,740
then a number of studies suggest fish consumption is good for glucose control and lowering risk for type two diabetes.

223
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:15,830
So that's why I say food intake. Temple fair.

224
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:20,910
So you have to understand. So the this is a very simple attack.

225
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:26,640
Right. So that's why arrows should have come from the confounder to the outcome.

226
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:31,460
But also, this arrow should have come from confounder to the exposure.

227
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:40,010
So then the next question is, is, is seafood intake is a source of our senior.

228
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:46,220
It's a scary story, right? Okay.

229
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:56,920
But. It's not just the service, but the more important one is that this paper, it doesn't.

230
00:27:57,020 --> 00:28:03,960
Okay. This paper say that. So our it's not just a one singular matter.

231
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:09,430
So I will not help all the dependents of our senior in this class.

232
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:14,240
But, you know, just a basic background with our senior.

233
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:19,260
So our senior has a many different species, so different types of Arseny.

234
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,810
So most toxic arsenal is in inorganic arson.

235
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:29,200
So that's why the arsenic that we really concern is this inorganic arsenic.

236
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:36,670
But when arsenic, you know, where this arsenic, arsenic is naturally, you know, naturally exists.

237
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:41,980
Right. So there are many a certain area, including Michigan.

238
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,950
Michigan has a naturally have high arsenic level.

239
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:53,470
So that's why the, you know, certain area, the soil concentration of arsenic is very high.

240
00:28:53,470 --> 00:29:01,330
And that's why when they, you know, drill down and then make their own private, well,

241
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:07,480
so then they have to be careful that arsenic is not detected in their drinking water like a groundwater.

242
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:14,510
Right. So that's why. No, you know, was arsenic found in the environment?

243
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:20,589
So that is the form of inorganic. Right. And then this arsenic, you know,

244
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:27,280
the bacteria take up this arsenic and they're through the food chain and then flunked all

245
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:34,100
and the small fish and the larger fears and then the human and animal eat those things.

246
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:43,750
Right. So that's why the bioaccumulation through this bioaccumulation generally, these bacteria methylated, this arsenic.

247
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:55,480
Which means that put this matter, the structure into this inorganic arsenic, which is creating this organic forms of arsenic.

248
00:29:56,290 --> 00:30:01,870
And then when this methylation repair, toxicity of arsenic go down.

249
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:12,600
So that was some form of arsenic which found in the fears has a very little toxic effect.

250
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:17,670
So toxicity not, you know, toxic if then we see in drinking water.

251
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:26,839
Okay. So that's why the so, you know, eating fish, even though, you know, arsenal liver is high.

252
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:36,560
But we don't. So if you measure arsenic from the fish, then in Oregon, in our testing is very low, but organic arsenic is very high.

253
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:42,920
Okay. Which is good news. Right. So that's why I enjoy eating fish.

254
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:48,310
Okay. So your question.

255
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:56,590
So are your cities or public utilities supposed to report harassment in open data?

256
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:02,949
Yeah. So they so the the public, you know, the water treatment plant.

257
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:09,339
And so they periodically measure this arsenic and then, you know,

258
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:15,010
they are removing all this are send people they supply the water to the you know, the resident.

259
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:20,920
So that's why. But also they why the especially in Michigan main problem is you know residents

260
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:26,020
who use their own private well and then Michigan department you know the.

261
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:36,440
Environmental Health Department and Public Health Department say they encourage the resident they pass by them,

262
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:43,110
sir, and that if they see any high arcing lover that report to the state and the state reminded.

263
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:54,190
So that's the step. Okay. And another important point, you have to think about how our Senate was measured in this study.

264
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:59,320
So now we are we talk more about just generally important to her.

265
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:03,760
Okay. Move that. Move to the in. So epidemiology.

266
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:12,340
So epidemiology is we are looking at our senior year and type two diabetes in a population.

267
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:16,030
Okay. So then we rely on.

268
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:22,370
So we. We say our thing. You. But our sending is not a simple arsenal.

269
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,170
How does a sturdy major arsenal or determined arsenal?

270
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:38,959
So if you consider our civic groups opposed to it as it goes to your audience to take a

271
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:44,280
listen to different segments except for the second one or I guess it's not libertarian,

272
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:49,430
so it stays the same. But they took from the enhanced data center.

273
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:59,060
I took a a stream of participants and had the do during spikes and then measured the different metabolites.

274
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:04,290
Right. And they started off a bit more and then some of the metabolites were under limited attacks.

275
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:09,620
Right. So they ended up with the total arsenic. The metabolite received seafood and then one of the.

276
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:13,880
Right. So rely on biomarker.

277
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:18,260
Right. So there are several way to determine arsenic exposure.

278
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:22,190
So then when you think about it, this specimen research question.

279
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:27,290
So then you when you design your study, then you have to decide how we measure arsenic.

280
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:37,010
Right. So one simple way is make a go develop your instrument in terms of historical things are sending exposure through questionnaire.

281
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:50,030
So that is one way. Another way is we rely on biomarker so that so we collect blood, we collect urine, we collect nature, we collect hair.

282
00:33:50,330 --> 00:34:00,230
So using those bio specimen and then we can determine and specifically for our senior urine is is considered good biomarker.

283
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:06,290
And this is because arsenic in blood level lover is very low.

284
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:10,280
It's hard to detect and is fast metabolized.

285
00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:15,350
And that's why the the high levels of arsenic excreted through the urine.

286
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:20,870
So that's why just take urine any time and then accounting for this urine dilution level.

287
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:27,170
So we will talk about that later. And then we can determine different species of arsenic detected in urine.

288
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:33,860
And then, you know, many different types of arsenic, this study major.

289
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:40,770
But eventually what variable they use. When they when they pass this research kitchen.

290
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:51,640
Don't put her on Twitter or any means that Twitter us any consist of inorganic garcinia, organic garcinia,

291
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:59,620
methylated arsenic many different types of us together so that your inorganic arsenic from where.

292
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:06,320
Drinking water. Rice consumption.

293
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:15,420
And then air right main source of the toxic arsenal is their organic arsenal.

294
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:19,860
Come from where? Save for the consumption.

295
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:24,000
Okay. So that's why we manager.

296
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:31,740
Maybe I better use slide. I.

297
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:37,410
So this study major, our senior.

298
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:49,280
But this is a tall order. But it's a total larceny and it's just over this in Oregon, in our Senate, and then Oregon in our Senate.

299
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:58,990
And then within this Oregon in our senior. Arsenal bet pain.

300
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:13,060
So this is the one of the most abundant organic arsenic component can be seen can be found in.

301
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:18,780
Again, not only human, but in in fish seafood.

302
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:31,930
Okay. So when you make or your conceptual motor in terms of high today ability to the right.

303
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:41,350
And then this is what you want to test. So what you actually want to test is this inorganic or a.

304
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:48,360
And then this type two diabetes. But you are not.

305
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:56,140
Measuring inorganic arsenic directly. But in this study, they have is polarizing.

306
00:36:56,570 --> 00:37:04,580
So that's why the total arsenic. So this is on observe.

307
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:11,210
So let me use it. Is that should of. And that this is actually what you made.

308
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:18,160
So what you measure. But. But they try this quarter century in practice.

309
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:23,180
And then. And then here.

310
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:30,670
Just total and also impact. Will you then put this arsenal behind?

311
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:38,770
Right. And then this is a fish.

312
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:47,840
Is it better to? Fierce impact that this are such a big thing and then fish consumption.

313
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:52,160
In practice. Type two diabetes, right.

314
00:37:53,000 --> 00:38:03,980
So what you are evaluating is looking at so in your regression model, you are putting this tolerance into the mother and the you are looking at there.

315
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:10,070
But what I actually want I want you to test is the effect of this in Oregon, in our city.

316
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:21,180
And then high two diabetes. So that's why in this the scenario, the road of this consumption through this back door.

317
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:29,370
So later, I will talk more about this whole know diagram more and then this can play as a confounder.

318
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:49,320
And then. So there are two types of confounder.

319
00:38:50,970 --> 00:39:02,250
And one is just confounder. So this is typically we see so when you look at you know the any a chemical exposure and

320
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:08,970
then our health outcome and one of the main confounder is for example smoking status.

321
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:13,770
So cigaret smoking cigaret is a source of environmental chemical.

322
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:21,450
You're right. So that's why environmental exposure and then health outcomes and then let's say smoking.

323
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:28,530
They're smoking in part explains positive associate.

324
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:31,600
Also smoking increase in long exposure.

325
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:35,110
Smoking also increase the risk of the disease.

326
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:40,270
So that's why if you look at involved exposure without smoking.

327
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:44,730
Your effect to estimate is inflated.

328
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:50,130
So by adjusting for smoking you effect this may go down.

329
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:57,680
So that's why adjustment. May the impact estimate toward their.

330
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:06,760
Because the. Direction is the same.

331
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:11,650
Okay. So negative confounder is a different case.

332
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:15,580
So in this case, our senior high today, every day.

333
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:28,309
And the fish consumption. So this confirmation impact polarizing because you are looking at a bigger fish consumption.

334
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:33,470
You're so source of this organic virus anyway. So that's why this is a positive direction.

335
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:39,780
And the fish consumption impact tied to the everyday in which the direction.

336
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:49,890
Now that you. So that's why we the adjustment this beta move away.

337
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:56,340
From the north. Okay.

338
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:09,060
So this negative compound is a very cheap cur in a situation where when you look at involuntary exposure and health outcome.

339
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:24,530
We often see this. So without consideration of this negative confounder and you open like a you make a wrong conclusion which can be mis misused.

340
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:29,389
So before this study or just for this consumption,

341
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:35,450
what was their finding in terms of the relationship between arsenic, saltwater, arsenic and type two diabetes?

342
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:42,120
No. No association.

343
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:45,680
Right. So if they stop there.

344
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:54,650
So they didn't consider this negative, confounding fish consumption, but how they conclude that in terms of this arsenic toxicity.

345
00:41:55,740 --> 00:42:01,050
Our senior does not influence the risk for type two diabetes.

346
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:11,889
Right. Which is different from what they believe because anyone study experimental studies suggest that are sending hazardous you know

347
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:21,190
metabolic effect and that's why they are there are a prior hypothesis was arsenic is so associated with type two diabetes.

348
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:25,450
So before they look at this, they were not able to make that conclusion,

349
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:32,770
but only after they consider these fish consumption, they were able to draw this conclusion.

350
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:36,570
Right. Pressure. Yeah.

351
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:40,170
It's a question about the two ratios.

352
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:43,980
Right. So, like, operations are boring, right?

353
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:50,790
So when you're thinking of managing this just for the value of the odds ratio, you get a lot.

354
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:59,309
So this one sort of we'll have another tends to talk about when you do cross-sectional study and then when you look at the binary

355
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:08,960
outcome and then whether or not confirm sort of logistic regression and then calculating odds ratio is a proper approach or not.

356
00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:13,440
So we will actually look there when you do a generalized linear model.

357
00:43:13,890 --> 00:43:17,340
Okay. So let's move.

358
00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:23,760
So without discussing that pas right now, so let's focus on in this case, we're just consulting.

359
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:30,680
Okay. Question. I just have a question about the the effects on religion, the knowledge works.

360
00:43:30,690 --> 00:43:36,260
And so if we're looking at this as the founder and say the magnitude,

361
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:42,820
the the positive, confounder, the negative, confounder or equal, does that cancel?

362
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:53,090
Right. So in this case, let's say even this is also to authentic and then this is a type of diabetes and then let's say smoking players,

363
00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:58,910
a positive confounder, and then fish consumption plays a negative confounder.

364
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:00,550
Then this two effect. So.

365
00:44:01,770 --> 00:44:10,080
If you are not considerate, both smoking and fears, then probably this positive, confounding and negative component can cancel out.

366
00:44:10,530 --> 00:44:14,430
And then so you will see, I guess, after you are putting those two.

367
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:18,490
If compounding effect is core, then you receive no change.

368
00:44:19,350 --> 00:44:25,799
So that's why the like and when you do your study and when you provide different Malda so you have

369
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:32,310
to justify so why you believe this is a confounding and then provide a different model effect to

370
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:39,270
estimate and then the audience can can see understand so how each individual impact though I guess

371
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:45,190
I'm just asking this and some of the models in all the models they have a collection of capacities,

372
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:50,520
right? And so to know which one specifically is the confounders.

373
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:59,190
So education is positive and then another right is negative and those cancel each other out in the same model.

374
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:03,960
It can happen. And then so that is also something we we do exercise a lot.

375
00:45:04,050 --> 00:45:10,740
Okay, let's so whenever we see, you know, when we run the mall, the when we look at the output and then let's discuss that together.

376
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:14,790
Okay? Okay. All right. So that's why from this paper.

377
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:20,820
So before you actually look at the this. So I will provide you, uh,

378
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:27,570
not the same data because this study looked at only one cycle of and then I will provide you

379
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:34,650
like a two cycle or three cycles of the data and you will evaluate the same idea over this.

380
00:45:34,890 --> 00:45:44,730
Okay. And then evaluating this confounding effect, but not only confounding, but also nonlinear dose response relationship and then many other things.

381
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:48,630
Okay. All right. Any question about the woman.

382
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:56,930
So in homo you have a you have eight persons and then what is the exposure and then how exposed was major?

383
00:45:56,940 --> 00:46:00,190
What is the outcome? How outcome was major not only.

384
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:06,509
So those are obviously important want before you start this study but the the the

385
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:11,110
key part of this sex so this homo one was that whether or not you understand

386
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:21,180
this negative confounding and then when negative component was considered in this paper and that in this study and how that impact the association.

387
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:25,740
Okay. It isn't a general question.

388
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:32,680
I was a little confused about why they were using total urinary arsenal, why they when they did have the time.

389
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:36,370
That's all. That's a good point. That was a direct.

390
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:40,450
Yeah. So anyone, anyone.

391
00:46:40,450 --> 00:46:45,250
Heather tends to because I hear the same.

392
00:46:49,330 --> 00:46:55,890
And then here. So those are the the hallmark person and then paper.

393
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:59,820
And then here I provide additional paper.

394
00:46:59,830 --> 00:47:04,480
So I don't know how many have a chance to read those two additional papers.

395
00:47:05,470 --> 00:47:10,930
I strongly recommend you take a look because after this.

396
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:17,670
And then another paper came out criticizing that one.

397
00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:23,280
Exactly the point. Right. So why they look at Cauterizing?

398
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:31,170
Why not? Why not? Using inorganic are saying just subtracting from water minus this organic.

399
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:40,230
And then even though we didn't directly measure inorganic but mathematically we can assume that after picking up 4% organic peas,

400
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:49,200
then the remaining remainder is in Oregon. Right. So that's why this paper use these and then click inside of the paper.

401
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:52,500
So the the all your paper that you already read.

402
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:57,060
And then they also, you know,

403
00:47:57,510 --> 00:48:06,360
ask about the statistical approach that is none of us are seeing on paper there and then also criticize their statistical approach.

404
00:48:06,990 --> 00:48:16,950
And then so the reason why I provide this is so this is how probably if they meet and then they argue each other,

405
00:48:16,950 --> 00:48:21,660
then they may not be very polite to criticize each other.

406
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:26,010
Right. But when you write a paper, you should respect the other group.

407
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:36,930
That's why I very politely. But I can I can I can feel their like a behind the, you know, the line and how they frustrate when they read this paper.

408
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:42,390
Right. And then so that's what another seeing group also responded.

409
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:48,960
And then even so, this study, they as you can see, they extended the sympathy.

410
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:56,220
So by like adding additional sticker. And then even after like so so this study.

411
00:48:57,350 --> 00:49:09,620
This additional follow up paper. They even restrict to only non fish consumer because fiscal some consumer they are also they

412
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:15,560
are total are senior or even inorganic are senior still influenced by the fish consumption.

413
00:49:16,670 --> 00:49:22,380
I can mathematical like a calculation just simple total remind us or again equal to inorganic.

414
00:49:22,670 --> 00:49:27,649
But this inorganic arsenic concentration is also highly related to fish

415
00:49:27,650 --> 00:49:33,920
consumption so it's not pure inorganic are saying the probability better approach

416
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:40,040
is restricting to non fish consumer and then when they look at non fish consumer

417
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:45,830
still they see an association between arsenic and then type two diabetes.

418
00:49:46,130 --> 00:49:55,820
So that's why they counter-attacked. And then so that's why I so this is very interesting, you know, scientific conversation, right?

419
00:49:56,270 --> 00:50:01,280
And then hopefully this is a good example so you can find that information here.

420
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:06,020
Okay. All right. Um.

421
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:10,130
It's already 953. So, any other question about humor?

422
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:18,060
One clean up. Okay. You are very excited to do this data analysis after reading this paper.

423
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:31,070
Right. Okay, so let's take up this time for a five minute break and then we will resume at ten and then move to the the Richter lecture.

424
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,761
Okay. Okay. Well, I actually think that you should see this in classical cover.

425
00:50:42,639 --> 00:50:47,739
So that today and then next week and over the next three weeks.

426
00:50:47,739 --> 00:50:57,099
So we were focused on this linear model. And today mainly we really focus on adjustment and how adjustment can be done.

427
00:50:57,099 --> 00:51:02,049
And then so this is also not very new.

428
00:51:02,529 --> 00:51:05,739
And then next week we will move to scale.

429
00:51:06,689 --> 00:51:16,329
So. And so the only skill scaling change we will consider is a lower transformation.

430
00:51:16,419 --> 00:51:28,199
But when you do longer transformation in for the outcome, and then what is the best practice to do and then to interpret the finding?

431
00:51:28,389 --> 00:51:33,979
Okay. And then the following way we just talk about the biomarker.

432
00:51:33,999 --> 00:51:43,809
And then when you look at the biomarker and how biomarker impact your statistical model building and then what component you have to consider.

433
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:50,229
Okay. So those are the our the content of this linear model.

434
00:51:51,849 --> 00:52:01,049
Okay. So the outline. So we will talk about, you know, when you write a paper and typically, you know, in paper,

435
00:52:01,049 --> 00:52:08,579
one paper to present is there in the model building and then confounding and then regression diagnostic.

436
00:52:10,639 --> 00:52:17,059
So what kind of return we typically present? So in table one descriptive statistics.

437
00:52:17,059 --> 00:52:25,129
So what is this population? What is the distribution of age, gender, race, ethnicity and many other variables that you collect here?

438
00:52:27,169 --> 00:52:34,159
And then like a statistically you are presenting mean standard deviation or quantile or frequency,

439
00:52:34,549 --> 00:52:42,719
and then you are doing this normal test and the bivariate analysis so that you are looking at this correlation or, or categorical variable.

440
00:52:42,719 --> 00:52:46,989
We're making the tool by tool and by end table.

441
00:52:47,659 --> 00:52:52,549
And then finally you are moving to this hypothesis testing and then building your regression model.

442
00:52:54,839 --> 00:52:58,799
So this is the one example of, you know, a typical table one.

443
00:52:59,099 --> 00:53:12,189
And this study looking at the air pollution and Harvard heart rate variability, which is one of the a cardiovascular function we can measure.

444
00:53:12,599 --> 00:53:21,269
And then one of the study question was whether or not this air pollution and heart rate variability modified by hypertension status.

445
00:53:21,629 --> 00:53:23,219
But that's why, you know,

446
00:53:23,219 --> 00:53:33,389
the this study showed that what is the characteristic in the entire population and then what is the characteristic stratified by hypertension status.

447
00:53:33,629 --> 00:53:40,319
And then you can see various vary over and then you can see on the person who was the author of this paper.

448
00:53:40,709 --> 00:53:45,809
I mean, this is my first piece to a dissertation paper.

449
00:53:47,719 --> 00:53:54,809
Another paper you can see is. So the previous papers show was this distribution.

450
00:53:54,879 --> 00:53:59,879
So another way is so this is kind of the bivariate relationship.

451
00:54:00,209 --> 00:54:06,869
So that's why the exporter this paper look at is this fruit and vegetable intake.

452
00:54:07,139 --> 00:54:13,129
So that's why the way this paper presented is what is the distribution of all of this variable

453
00:54:13,129 --> 00:54:22,259
here by the rank order of these fruit and vegetable intake so they categorize into quirkier.

454
00:54:22,469 --> 00:54:27,539
So Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, and then present the distribution of those.

455
00:54:28,499 --> 00:54:41,369
Okay. One thing you can notice is on the bottom, you can see this dietary intake and then there is some more, you know, superscript.

456
00:54:41,729 --> 00:54:50,369
And then it says that this is poorer energy adjusted dietary intake, not crude, the dietary intake.

457
00:54:52,299 --> 00:54:55,799
What does this mean? They reported.

458
00:54:57,419 --> 00:55:02,068
So dietary intake can be obtained from his junior,

459
00:55:02,069 --> 00:55:09,239
so food frequency kitchen area and then from the person that you can calculate the frequency of each individual food.

460
00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:15,379
In this case, they create this composite intake of fruit and vegetable,

461
00:55:16,469 --> 00:55:23,249
but not simply like a crude frequency adding of all of these vegetable and fruit.

462
00:55:25,779 --> 00:55:39,939
Main concern was that when you look at this individual diet and health and the individual diet intake depends on how much total energy you eat, right?

463
00:55:40,269 --> 00:55:48,339
And then this total energy intake is a very important predictor or risk factor for, you know, many different kinds of chronic diseases.

464
00:55:48,909 --> 00:55:58,359
So that's why if you look at just crude dietary intake and then health outcome, that association can be confounded by this total energy intake.

465
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:06,339
Right. So even though, let's say your crude frequency of fruit and vegetable is very high.

466
00:56:06,909 --> 00:56:10,179
But at the same time, you are eating a lot of random in. Right.

467
00:56:11,149 --> 00:56:24,619
And then if you just look at this large amount of fruit and vegetable, then that person's effect at the population number may not be validly computed.

468
00:56:24,739 --> 00:56:32,479
So that's why by adjusting for this total energy intake, we can tease out this pure vegetable and fruit intake effect.

469
00:56:32,809 --> 00:56:36,379
And that that's the way to do your analysis.

470
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:43,429
So even at this table, one showing the crude intake may not be very good.

471
00:56:43,999 --> 00:56:50,419
So that's why I presented this total energy adjusted dietary intake in this table.

472
00:56:50,729 --> 00:56:54,549
Okay. All right.

473
00:56:55,359 --> 00:56:59,619
Another table that I also want to show is this age adjusted predictor.

474
00:57:00,529 --> 00:57:05,689
So this is about the law of the land, tba la la land.

475
00:57:05,809 --> 00:57:12,229
The tibia and patellar land are different types of biomarker or lab exposure.

476
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:19,338
So typically we measure lead from blood. So you collect blood and then measure blood from lead.

477
00:57:19,339 --> 00:57:26,328
From blood. But blood Latin lover. So the main limitation of using blood led is blood allowed.

478
00:57:26,329 --> 00:57:32,349
Only tell you how long you saw your participant exposed to this in the lab.

479
00:57:33,319 --> 00:57:37,009
We call this is a head flight or elimination flight.

480
00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:40,459
Okay. So that's why brother led elimination.

481
00:57:40,469 --> 00:57:49,169
Her flight is about a month. Which means that when you collect your blood, those all your participants blood and the measure,

482
00:57:49,679 --> 00:57:55,399
the level it is it reflect only the blood relatives producing happen over the past number.

483
00:57:57,459 --> 00:58:03,219
When you feel outcome is chronic disease, then bloodletting may not be a relevant biomarker.

484
00:58:03,729 --> 00:58:07,929
So that's another alternative is measuring bone level fever.

485
00:58:08,319 --> 00:58:19,209
And this is because bone is our organ system that so when we exposed to led lead is certainly in the body and then saw

486
00:58:19,209 --> 00:58:29,559
my excrete out of the body but a number so large amount of lead deposited in the bone the stained open for a long time.

487
00:58:30,659 --> 00:58:41,579
So generally so tibial level this is a very hard the ball and then eliminating half life is about several decades so 30 years.

488
00:58:42,279 --> 00:58:46,408
Okay patella leather lover. So patella already is a patella.

489
00:58:46,409 --> 00:58:52,229
Bone is a softer bone. So that's why this is a more so shorter half life.

490
00:58:52,619 --> 00:58:54,719
And then typical is just several years.

491
00:58:57,379 --> 00:59:06,078
So this is why if we look at all these different types of land and by age you can see this plot leather covered,

492
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:09,679
PBR, leather, leather, patella leather lover is a function of age.

493
00:59:11,099 --> 00:59:23,039
Okay. Especially this ball at 11. So 14.6 for middle age and the 21 for ages 60 and 69 and the over 7027.

494
00:59:23,979 --> 00:59:28,329
For Keebler. Well, Patella lat, you can see the same trend.

495
00:59:28,749 --> 00:59:34,679
23. 30. 38. Okay.

496
00:59:35,939 --> 00:59:39,539
And then let's look at this part.

497
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:43,169
So smoking status and the look at the tibia and patella.

498
00:59:44,909 --> 00:59:49,829
So then you can see the never smoker. Former smoker, current smoker.

499
00:59:50,809 --> 00:59:55,069
And then the relationship with this tibial. What is your conclusion?

500
00:59:55,549 --> 00:59:58,839
What is the relationship between smoking status and TB 11?

501
01:00:00,199 --> 01:00:05,119
22. 22.7. 21.5.

502
01:00:06,169 --> 01:00:09,199
Do you see much difference? Not much. Right.

503
01:00:09,679 --> 01:00:19,999
So that's why if you look at US crude by the relationship between smoking status and TB leather lover, you will see that we don't see much difference.

504
01:00:20,239 --> 01:00:25,549
So it doesn't matter. You are somewhat you are smoker, never smoker, current smoker, former smoker.

505
01:00:25,549 --> 01:00:35,749
We don't see much difference. Right? But the problem is this could be confounded some masked by this age effect.

506
01:00:36,659 --> 01:00:47,439
Why? Age dispersion within each smoking status group a different.

507
01:00:49,829 --> 01:00:54,779
So then never a smoker. More younger or older people.

508
01:00:58,599 --> 01:01:03,399
Former smoker. More younger or older people?

509
01:01:05,679 --> 01:01:10,329
Current smokers are likely to be younger or older.

510
01:01:17,229 --> 01:01:24,749
Why are you. Why are you still small? Because you don't you don't feel any health problem, right?

511
01:01:25,199 --> 01:01:29,999
Mostly at the smoker when they stop smoking. So they feel, oh, I cannot breathe.

512
01:01:30,089 --> 01:01:34,199
That's right. My blood pressure very high. Right. And then your physician.

513
01:01:34,469 --> 01:01:41,339
So that you have to stop smoking. Right. And then when they when you feel that, you know, condition, then you'll get bored.

514
01:01:41,429 --> 01:01:48,059
Right. So that's why I called smoker. More like it to be young and therefore more smoke or more likely to be old.

515
01:01:49,379 --> 01:01:52,859
So that's why smoking status is related to age.

516
01:01:53,219 --> 01:01:58,739
And then we already see that TV a little ever is highly correlated with this age.

517
01:01:59,159 --> 01:02:09,389
So that's why after we account for age. And do you see that age adjusted to a level over 21, 22.8 24?

518
01:02:10,499 --> 01:02:18,539
So do you see this? Don't depend on pattern. Right. So that's why the current smoker hire never smoker law.

519
01:02:18,869 --> 01:02:22,839
Same phenomenon happen in Latin America.

520
01:02:23,219 --> 01:02:27,719
So that's why the goal of this paper showing this bilateral relationship.

521
01:02:27,989 --> 01:02:36,989
But if we show only so just crude by association, then it may not fully account for this age effect.

522
01:02:37,229 --> 01:02:43,379
And that's why we are not able to properly, you know, conclude the relationship between smoking and people, let alone.

523
01:02:43,709 --> 01:02:53,519
So that's why additional column and they showing their age adjusted PBR and age adjusted km number.

524
01:02:53,839 --> 01:02:58,069
Okay. So I have to read this.

525
01:02:58,909 --> 01:03:02,929
And then you can just simply say that, Oh, okay, this is a good idea.

526
01:03:03,379 --> 01:03:07,939
But now you come to this class. The person is happy.

527
01:03:08,959 --> 01:03:13,789
So how can we calculate this age adjusted PBL number?

528
01:03:14,539 --> 01:03:24,649
So from your previous classes, just think about how this can be done and you can suggest to how I can calculate this age adjusted table at the level.

529
01:03:36,839 --> 01:03:42,389
It's okay. That is what we will learn from this. Okay, let's move on.

530
01:03:43,919 --> 01:03:52,799
Simple linear regression. This is a very simple regression model that we know from the piece and that we did this exercise.

531
01:03:53,129 --> 01:03:57,089
Why? Outcome beta zero. Intercept beta one x.

532
01:03:57,809 --> 01:04:01,959
And then I put this I. So this is indicating each individual.

533
01:04:02,549 --> 01:04:10,229
And then Epsilon will add upon. So that's why the x i xy is a predictor for self that i.

534
01:04:10,499 --> 01:04:13,919
And then erratum or rejigger for subject i.

535
01:04:14,369 --> 01:04:17,879
So what does what is. What is this? What is this time?

536
01:04:24,649 --> 01:04:31,619
Return error. Wichita. So this is the part of the outcome.

537
01:04:33,159 --> 01:04:43,029
Which cannot be explained by SDI, which means that after you are accounting for or eliminating the component that

538
01:04:43,029 --> 01:04:50,199
can be explained by this X variable out of the outcome and then remaining part.

539
01:04:51,109 --> 01:04:59,479
So that's why this is a region, right? But eventually this region is.

540
01:04:59,499 --> 01:05:06,779
So this is why. This is actually why I'm making this Frigidaire independent.

541
01:05:06,789 --> 01:05:15,429
All the independent. Of X ray.

542
01:05:19,079 --> 01:05:29,249
So this is why, if better ones are after you fit them harder and then interpretation is based on equal to zero, then we say the x does another thing.

543
01:05:29,249 --> 01:05:38,669
So there is no association between x and Y. And then if you see beta one greater than zero, then when x increases, then y also increases.

544
01:05:38,879 --> 01:05:44,969
If beta less than zero so negative, then when x increases, y decrease.

545
01:05:45,569 --> 01:05:50,939
So we are testing this hypothesis equipped to beta one equal to zero.

546
01:05:51,329 --> 01:05:59,259
Okay. All right. And then after you've fit the model and then you look at whether or not your model is good,

547
01:05:59,799 --> 01:06:03,339
how good it is, so that you're you are taking this goodness of here.

548
01:06:05,149 --> 01:06:16,399
And then you you're making this regression line, this regression line equation and any any given point, and then you can calculate.

549
01:06:16,909 --> 01:06:24,289
So given X and then expected the value of X and then you can calculate this expected the value of Y from the order.

550
01:06:24,979 --> 01:06:31,959
And then other point. So let's say this, that is XY and then from the regression line.

551
01:06:31,969 --> 01:06:41,839
So that's why the expected value so y had. And then any other or so observation that we can calculate is regression point.

552
01:06:42,139 --> 01:06:50,359
And then we did our point. So that's why the distance from this expected the value to any observation.

553
01:06:51,339 --> 01:06:56,529
That distance, this horizon to the vertical distance is a regional component.

554
01:06:57,859 --> 01:07:07,069
And then this regression point, so line point and then the expected value of Y and then this is the regression component.

555
01:07:07,339 --> 01:07:12,769
So the goal is minimizing this original component and then maximizing this regression point.

556
01:07:12,769 --> 01:07:15,889
So that is how this regression line is determined.

557
01:07:17,569 --> 01:07:22,929
Hey. So our output.

558
01:07:22,969 --> 01:07:33,259
So you may have already seen. So not only are, but also in the SAS or whatever statistical program, then this is a very typical output you will see.

559
01:07:34,129 --> 01:07:41,719
So first, this is a regression model, our equation and then you will see the distribution of ADR.

560
01:07:42,259 --> 01:07:47,749
So from this distribution, what we are looking for, what do we want to see?

561
01:07:51,239 --> 01:07:54,509
So this can be used. Your goodness of fear, right?

562
01:08:06,689 --> 01:08:17,069
So what is the mean over radio? We know are.

563
01:08:22,999 --> 01:08:29,859
Mean, you do a quick tour. Zero, right?

564
01:08:30,829 --> 01:08:35,969
So that's why when you see the media. And then men.

565
01:08:37,089 --> 01:08:40,119
So looking at those two numbers, what you can.

566
01:08:40,569 --> 01:08:50,109
What you have in your. What you can imagine comparing this to a number when median close to the mere.

567
01:08:53,239 --> 01:08:57,849
It's a normal distribution. So they tried to rejigger distribution from this.

568
01:08:57,889 --> 01:09:01,179
What we are looking for is normal distribution, right?

569
01:09:02,119 --> 01:09:11,479
But not only whether or not this median is close to the mean, which is equal to zero, whether it's we are looking at looking for symmetry.

570
01:09:12,199 --> 01:09:19,429
Right. So that's why the first quarter or third quarter, whether or not they are equally like a space.

571
01:09:19,879 --> 01:09:24,509
So that's a negative point. All seven, nine. Positive point.

572
01:09:24,519 --> 01:09:28,929
All seven three. So this looks okay, right?

573
01:09:31,089 --> 01:09:36,009
And they even maximum minimum also equally space.

574
01:09:36,159 --> 01:09:40,119
Right. So it looks like this rigidity is very good, right?

575
01:09:40,509 --> 01:09:44,859
Okay. Next part is our regression table.

576
01:09:45,889 --> 01:09:49,249
So that's why this number we already did this exercise.

577
01:09:49,819 --> 01:09:56,359
Using this number, we can put this number to our regression formula and then we can understand how what

578
01:09:56,359 --> 01:10:01,739
is the relationship between age and systolic blood pressure and then bottom part.

579
01:10:02,059 --> 01:10:06,739
So this is actually the regression diagnostic estimate.

580
01:10:07,069 --> 01:10:18,109
So that's why the multiple hours care, adjusted hours care and then F statistic and R does not directly provide this analysis of various table.

581
01:10:19,039 --> 01:10:22,859
So this can be can get from another function.

582
01:10:23,419 --> 01:10:28,879
But we can also do this another test, and they're using this ANOVA test.

583
01:10:29,149 --> 01:10:33,138
So I took personal care, which is 115.

584
01:10:33,139 --> 01:10:44,419
So add them up, all of them. So they said for some of us care and then including aid, reduce this total sum of skill by 42.

585
01:10:44,719 --> 01:10:53,439
So some of scale that can be explained by the component of aid that is explained by and explained by aid.

586
01:10:54,079 --> 01:10:58,429
The component of the SBP explained by age is 42.

587
01:10:59,299 --> 01:11:04,129
So after taking out this so rigid or some obscure is 73.

588
01:11:05,289 --> 01:11:10,129
Hey. And using this. They can calculate.

589
01:11:10,159 --> 01:11:19,779
So ask him to ask Kelly is how much the mother so total sum of his care can be explained by your covariant.

590
01:11:19,879 --> 01:11:24,469
In this case, age. So how much age can you explain?

591
01:11:24,799 --> 01:11:28,209
About 37%. Okay.

592
01:11:28,679 --> 01:11:35,069
Age can explain 37% of the variation of systolic blood pressure.

593
01:11:40,999 --> 01:11:45,289
And then payroll protection aid, which is .004741.

594
01:11:45,619 --> 01:11:54,099
So each one unit increase, a one year increase in aid is associated with in this case, outcome is longer transfer and then will discuss this later.

595
01:11:54,109 --> 01:12:01,009
But let's say the effect to estimate can be interpreted as a low .0047.

596
01:12:01,729 --> 01:12:05,449
Okay. So reading this output.

597
01:12:06,259 --> 01:12:09,649
Right. So this is an incursion. So any.

598
01:12:10,739 --> 01:12:14,069
Point that. Unclear.

599
01:12:15,479 --> 01:12:20,069
Clearly not right. Okay.

600
01:12:21,839 --> 01:12:26,969
But in this case, only putting a so simple relationship is just a symptom.

601
01:12:26,979 --> 01:12:35,189
So we our body system, health outcome is not a simpler, simpler organ system.

602
01:12:35,189 --> 01:12:40,379
So that's why just a single variable may not be able to explain all the variation.

603
01:12:40,829 --> 01:12:47,129
So that's why we want to develop multiple milder of colony for many variables, right?

604
01:12:47,519 --> 01:12:50,129
So that's why we are developing this multiple linear regression.

605
01:12:51,179 --> 01:12:58,979
So the one example, so is infant birth weight influenced by either or both of mother's age and weight.

606
01:12:59,639 --> 01:13:11,309
So the outcome is infant birth weight. And we want to explain this the variation of B in front of birth weight using mom's age and then mom's weight.

607
01:13:13,179 --> 01:13:17,439
So that's why we are putting this two covariate into the model.

608
01:13:18,479 --> 01:13:23,969
And then let's say our main focus is this beta one, which is mom's age iPad.

609
01:13:25,539 --> 01:13:27,969
So then. Adjustment.

610
01:13:28,019 --> 01:13:40,559
And the interpretation is after we make this weight mom's weight effect constant or after this mom's the effect is become independent.

611
01:13:41,729 --> 01:13:50,099
If parent zero equal to zero, then there is no association and if beta one is not equal to zero.

612
01:13:50,579 --> 01:13:59,699
So then after accounting for this mom's weight, each one unit increase in mom's age, pretty infant birth weight.

613
01:14:00,329 --> 01:14:06,479
Okay. And then the other way, we can also say that after accounting for mom's age, it's fair.

614
01:14:06,779 --> 01:14:09,959
What is the petrol beta like? A long awaited back.

615
01:14:10,499 --> 01:14:19,429
Okay. So that's why adjusting for or accounting for means that you are making these.

616
01:14:20,619 --> 01:14:25,238
So this mom's age [INAUDIBLE] is independent of this.

617
01:14:25,239 --> 01:14:29,449
Mom's waiting that. Regardless of mom's weight.

618
01:14:29,449 --> 01:14:35,539
So it is £100 or £120 or £140.

619
01:14:35,919 --> 01:14:44,059
Doesn't matter. Right. We want to estimate this mom's age effect regardless of mom's weight.

620
01:14:44,609 --> 01:14:47,959
Okay. So what is the average mom's age back?

621
01:14:48,349 --> 01:14:51,619
So that is how this multiple regression is estimating.

622
01:14:56,399 --> 01:14:59,789
Okay. So that's why I already explain all this.

623
01:14:59,819 --> 01:15:12,869
So it just means that making these, you know, the other covariate or confounder constant and that you are estimating pure effect.

624
01:15:14,799 --> 01:15:22,389
So that's why this beta one. So moms age record without these moms weight records is a crude.

625
01:15:23,769 --> 01:15:29,259
And then after we are accounting for this months away, we can say that this adjusted estimate.

626
01:15:33,479 --> 01:15:38,379
And then this sentence. So if I say that so if.

627
01:15:38,379 --> 01:15:47,329
Effects of maternal aids. Different by maternal weight, which means that mom's age effects.

628
01:15:47,719 --> 01:15:56,759
So this is mom's age. And then this is infant weight.

629
01:15:57,599 --> 01:16:01,259
So the infant weight and the mom.

630
01:16:04,999 --> 01:16:09,859
Age [INAUDIBLE] is depending on mom's weight.

631
01:16:11,309 --> 01:16:14,919
So then this is a question about effective modification. Okay.

632
01:16:15,599 --> 01:16:20,699
So if commodities if you expect those effect a deposit.

633
01:16:21,779 --> 01:16:25,469
So that's why, as we said at the beginning of today's class.

634
01:16:25,829 --> 01:16:35,129
So you are putting this interaction, right? And that you are evaluating this effect modification through interaction modeling.

635
01:16:35,519 --> 01:16:40,029
Okay. Okay.

636
01:16:40,719 --> 01:16:44,649
So the back to table one. So then you remember, uh.

637
01:16:45,989 --> 01:16:50,789
She will be fair. So the relationship between Kabbalah and smoking status.

638
01:16:52,349 --> 01:17:03,659
And then after we account for the aid and then we are providing this, you know, table of age adjusted TB and leather liver by smoking status,

639
01:17:03,809 --> 01:17:12,629
which is adjusted age adjusted tibial level number is a better approach to provide this relationship.

640
01:17:14,749 --> 01:17:24,709
So then how can we do that? So that's the question. So the the main idea here is you are percolating this ball level ever.

641
01:17:26,669 --> 01:17:33,589
What a subject. Like after you are. Calculating the residual from the mortar.

642
01:17:35,079 --> 01:17:39,819
So then you are accounting for AIDS. So AIDS in the modern.

643
01:17:40,809 --> 01:17:45,609
So then the rigid air over your mother is regional.

644
01:17:45,609 --> 01:17:49,799
Dad is independent of age. Now you're eliminating age fare.

645
01:17:50,259 --> 01:17:53,789
Okay. But the reader again.

646
01:17:53,799 --> 01:17:59,469
What is this? What is the meaning of reader? Mean already there is.

647
01:18:00,419 --> 01:18:05,659
Zero. Right. So that's why you do not want to report that.

648
01:18:07,849 --> 01:18:12,319
Meanwhile, PBL at Liverpool never a smoker is zero.

649
01:18:13,469 --> 01:18:18,559
Mean or to able to deliver among foremost mockery is zero.

650
01:18:18,959 --> 01:18:22,529
Right. You don't know when a reporter. They're mean equal to zero.

651
01:18:22,919 --> 01:18:26,409
Right. So that's how we are adding a constant.

652
01:18:27,739 --> 01:18:31,549
So then what cornerstone is most representative?

653
01:18:31,549 --> 01:18:34,759
Constant. Okay.

654
01:18:35,269 --> 01:18:46,369
So what is the average person? So when you add this constant, you are calculating in this case, average.

655
01:18:47,969 --> 01:18:54,059
So a person with average age. And then you're adding blood.

656
01:18:54,149 --> 01:19:01,649
So the trivial leather lover for given the mean age, they're adding that constant.

657
01:19:02,609 --> 01:19:06,879
The dead is we can say that this is age adjusted tibia letter.

658
01:19:08,479 --> 01:19:15,249
So that is a general idea. Okay. So do this.

659
01:19:16,679 --> 01:19:19,859
Graphically explain that. So Covanta adjusted.

660
01:19:20,999 --> 01:19:24,929
All other lover making this regression line.

661
01:19:26,529 --> 01:19:30,699
And at any given point you can also calculate the rigid are.

662
01:19:32,679 --> 01:19:42,039
So this is your. And again, some of the rejigger or make so mean over there equal to zero.

663
01:19:42,039 --> 01:19:47,499
So that's we do not want to report just zero for the in fact, summary estimate.

664
01:19:47,979 --> 01:19:51,699
So that's why we are calculating average person's effect.

665
01:19:52,389 --> 01:19:55,629
In this case, the poverty we want to account for is age.

666
01:19:56,229 --> 01:20:00,519
So data. What is the expected value for leather lover?

667
01:20:01,299 --> 01:20:07,909
For the mean age. Okay.

668
01:20:08,809 --> 01:20:21,769
So that's why covariate adjusted in this case, age adjusted born leader lover is combination of this reader plus constant.

669
01:20:23,669 --> 01:20:29,599
Hey. And then this region is independent of age.

670
01:20:30,629 --> 01:20:35,069
So that's all we can say there. This rated R is independent of AIDS.

671
01:20:35,759 --> 01:20:39,029
Right. So this radio is independent.

672
01:20:46,289 --> 01:20:55,909
Right. So that's why the richer you will have something like this, right?

673
01:20:55,979 --> 01:21:02,149
Let's say you have this distribution. Adding a constant doesn't impact this distribution.

674
01:21:02,159 --> 01:21:06,779
Right. Just you are shifting. You're just simply shifting, right?

675
01:21:06,929 --> 01:21:14,219
What sphere for this distribution of reader, which is this is your TV out to deliver.

676
01:21:19,429 --> 01:21:29,599
That. Is independent of independent of age.

677
01:21:31,189 --> 01:21:36,668
Right. But if you are making crude the distribution, then the crude.

678
01:21:36,669 --> 01:21:41,339
The distribution depends on age. Right. So that's why you feel making those.

679
01:21:42,739 --> 01:21:51,239
Crude. Distribution. This is not so.

680
01:21:51,239 --> 01:22:00,779
This is dependent of age. So that's why you can say and then you better not to calculate, just mean or TB another number from this distribution.

681
01:22:01,289 --> 01:22:08,789
Okay. The goal is we want to make a distribution of TB, another level that is independent of aid.

682
01:22:09,769 --> 01:22:13,488
Okay. So then now this distribution is totally independent.

683
01:22:13,489 --> 01:22:21,899
Okay. But again, as I said, the meeting a quarter zero.

684
01:22:22,199 --> 01:22:26,159
That is not what we want to report. So that's how we are shifting.

685
01:22:27,509 --> 01:22:35,499
By adding. Shifting by adding.

686
01:22:38,079 --> 01:22:41,949
A constant loop.

687
01:22:41,979 --> 01:22:46,729
Constant. So then, you know, actually any cousin you can edit.

688
01:22:47,109 --> 01:22:51,379
Right. But, you know, you want to show. Look at this.

689
01:22:51,579 --> 01:23:00,369
That anyone can accept. Right. So that's why I want to show what is the what is the expected value of this letter lover.

690
01:23:01,089 --> 01:23:04,059
For the subject, we look at average a person in this population.

691
01:23:05,059 --> 01:23:12,169
So that's why the average person in this population, which is the person with the mean age, we are adding that number into here.

692
01:23:13,219 --> 01:23:21,499
Okay. So I want to make sure, look, conceptually now everyone is on the same page.

693
01:23:22,279 --> 01:23:24,989
Okay. They understand it.

694
01:23:26,239 --> 01:23:35,869
The relationship between this crude distribution and then you are calculating mean of this crude distribution and then by smoking status.

695
01:23:36,079 --> 01:23:40,308
So that is one way, but that's more crude distribution.

696
01:23:40,309 --> 01:23:45,949
And the mean of TB, another lover by smoking status still depends on AIDS.

697
01:23:46,399 --> 01:23:52,099
So that's why you can say that comparison. Never smoker, former smoker, current smoker.

698
01:23:52,339 --> 01:23:57,439
That comparison is not independent of AIDS. So you cannot make a proper comparison.

699
01:23:59,039 --> 01:24:06,719
That's why we want to eliminating this age of fair out of this tbeir distribution.

700
01:24:07,949 --> 01:24:13,279
How? Developing your regression model, taking residual error.

701
01:24:13,849 --> 01:24:18,589
So then this region here is distribution of tibial level number.

702
01:24:19,159 --> 01:24:22,729
But that is independent of it. Okay.

703
01:24:24,669 --> 01:24:28,269
Adding constant shifting these days to distribution.

704
01:24:29,019 --> 01:24:36,939
And then you are calculating the the the this mean of TB a little over what I saw with the mean age.

705
01:24:38,299 --> 01:24:43,519
Okay. So that's why someone may argue, oh, why mean eight?

706
01:24:44,429 --> 01:24:49,139
Well, I want to use the median age. It's a fire.

707
01:24:49,969 --> 01:24:53,689
If you're like you, if you want to use me, then it's fine.

708
01:24:53,959 --> 01:25:05,499
But you have to write in your metal section. We use media aid to calculate is the coordinate adjusted concentration, something like that.

709
01:25:05,509 --> 01:25:10,459
Right. But when you are using mean aids, then this this is typically accepted.

710
01:25:10,879 --> 01:25:22,189
So if we don't say anything that we assume that you calculate that AIDS adjusted concentration using the mean is so that is typically accepted, right?

711
01:25:23,059 --> 01:25:28,849
So that's why we are using this means. And your question.

712
01:25:30,359 --> 01:25:35,998
Clear. Except for we need a median age.

713
01:25:35,999 --> 01:25:39,989
So theoretically, any age in any age is fine.

714
01:25:41,079 --> 01:25:45,129
As long as we use you. You say that in your paper, right?

715
01:25:56,759 --> 01:26:02,369
Just before you're adding the flood levels at the mean. So it's not floods in this format.

716
01:26:02,999 --> 01:26:17,939
Yeah. Right. Right. The questions that we in a crude model like should the mean age from the mean to zero?

717
01:26:18,359 --> 01:26:22,289
Is that also eliminating the age effects?

718
01:26:25,069 --> 01:26:30,679
The another competitor that may reframe the UK.

719
01:26:30,679 --> 01:26:43,109
So the. Adding mean a so actually we are not adding meat is we are adding mean bone level liver for subs that we the mean eggs.

720
01:26:44,219 --> 01:26:47,419
Right. And actually that is constant.

721
01:26:48,509 --> 01:26:56,879
So it's a totally independent number, which doesn't impact the distribution of this as you adjust to a TV 11 network.

722
01:26:57,559 --> 01:27:02,059
Okay. So that's the core. And then if you have multiple variables.

723
01:27:02,309 --> 01:27:07,019
So that's why age, gender, race, ethnicity and the many other variables were.

724
01:27:08,079 --> 01:27:18,719
And then when you say I want to calculate this multiple variable adjusted, this pool level cover, which means that you are calculating,

725
01:27:19,059 --> 01:27:29,229
you are developing this regression model and then you are extracting reader from the model and therefore solve that with means.

726
01:27:30,159 --> 01:27:33,809
So we mean. Gender.

727
01:27:35,139 --> 01:27:40,569
I don't know what is the mean? Gender, mean, race, ethnicity, mean smoking.

728
01:27:40,579 --> 01:27:46,749
I mean education, whatever. Right. Putting all those more and then given that.

729
01:27:47,809 --> 01:27:54,139
This is the distribution of TBR level liver which is independent of all those cauvery.

730
01:27:54,589 --> 01:28:02,989
Right. Because you eliminate all that component from your motor and then using that information you are calculating this adjusted concentration.

731
01:28:04,489 --> 01:28:09,419
Okay. All right.

732
01:28:10,109 --> 01:28:17,489
Okay. Um, so four categorical variables that can be confounders.

733
01:28:18,769 --> 01:28:23,449
We just you take one of them as a reference and then adjust with that.

734
01:28:23,539 --> 01:28:27,379
Yeah. So that's why the when you calculate. So I know.

735
01:28:27,379 --> 01:28:35,989
So for those who are more familiar with the SAS, then you can use what is the estimate function.

736
01:28:36,139 --> 01:28:43,549
Right. In Grand Projet and you can use to estimate and then you specify the, you know,

737
01:28:43,549 --> 01:28:50,179
the value of continuous variable or category of your control can vary over my specified category.

738
01:28:50,839 --> 01:28:57,769
So that is how you define how you define this adjusted concentration for a certain group.

739
01:28:58,809 --> 01:29:07,449
Okay. If we don't specify specific group, then either SAS or whatever program they use mean.

740
01:29:07,689 --> 01:29:17,229
So that's why when you say when you have a binary sex variable, just zero or one, then they put point five.

741
01:29:18,729 --> 01:29:25,199
When you have three lever, for example, three lever smoking status, then one, two, three poison per.

742
01:29:25,359 --> 01:29:28,419
So then what is the mean to right.

743
01:29:29,109 --> 01:29:32,649
And actually, depending on the distribution, you have to even consider distribution, right?

744
01:29:33,069 --> 01:29:40,148
Let's say one is only 10%, two is another 20%, the rest of three is 70%.

745
01:29:40,149 --> 01:29:45,819
The mean is not two. Right. So based on the distribution and then you can have the weighted,

746
01:29:46,179 --> 01:29:54,789
so weighted mean that you then putting that in the still we are saying that mean of smoking, mean of gender.

747
01:29:54,819 --> 01:29:58,179
Right. Well, it's unclear what is the mean of gender.

748
01:29:58,179 --> 01:30:02,879
Right. There is no mean of gender. So that's why they're talking ways.

749
01:30:02,909 --> 01:30:11,559
You are just picking the reference group. So that's why this concentration is for female, this concentration for never smoke or something like that.

750
01:30:11,589 --> 01:30:16,179
Right. But another way, generally, we are using just so.

751
01:30:16,569 --> 01:30:22,779
Okay, technically it doesn't mean. But theoretically there is no mean gender, mean smoke instead.

752
01:30:22,929 --> 01:30:31,569
Right. So if you're. So if you're adding female or male to the model,

753
01:30:33,429 --> 01:30:40,549
are you saying it will be the same as stratification simply because that would be the same application?

754
01:30:41,709 --> 01:30:44,988
Uh. No.

755
01:30:44,989 --> 01:30:50,799
No. So stratification is like you are developing toward a different master.

756
01:30:51,409 --> 01:30:57,299
Right. So that's why stratification is is more likely when you consider the effect.

757
01:30:57,319 --> 01:31:06,069
In this case, you know, the. So the previous example was smoking as the exporter as the outcome.

758
01:31:06,069 --> 01:31:13,179
Right. And and then let's say you are stratify by an older age and a younger age.

759
01:31:14,079 --> 01:31:23,259
In this case, you are talking about smoking stratify by different smoking status and they each group and then calculate the.

760
01:31:25,249 --> 01:31:30,659
Each group calculate. A.G. and then a.

761
01:31:34,139 --> 01:31:38,279
I'm confused. Let me think about it.

762
01:31:38,789 --> 01:31:43,529
Okay. Okay. Let's move on. And then maybe we can come back this later.

763
01:31:44,689 --> 01:31:49,189
Okay. But, uh, another point that I actually.

764
01:31:49,459 --> 01:31:59,849
Even though I sit. Hopefully this is not the first time you you you know, you are you learn all about this adjustment, right?

765
01:32:00,509 --> 01:32:04,379
But from your previous class, you did. It is a lot of time.

766
01:32:05,919 --> 01:32:10,859
Right. How? Because you know what is centering.

767
01:32:12,359 --> 01:32:16,479
Okay. So what does the intercept indicate?

768
01:32:16,489 --> 01:32:20,138
What is this? Why call Peter zero?

769
01:32:20,139 --> 01:32:23,979
What does Peter Peter zero mean? What is it?

770
01:32:26,139 --> 01:32:30,369
This is the interest that. But what does Interessante mean?

771
01:32:32,279 --> 01:32:38,339
And that's when all the school begins. So there is no comedy in this case.

772
01:32:38,609 --> 01:32:44,739
What is it? In this, let's say this is SVP, right?

773
01:32:44,949 --> 01:32:51,069
And then you are just making systolic blood pressure without covariate on the intercept.

774
01:32:51,639 --> 01:32:57,279
So then beta zero is. This is. Meanwhile this week.

775
01:32:58,999 --> 01:33:02,819
Right. This is amino acid repair.

776
01:33:06,179 --> 01:33:11,149
What does the intercept indicate when a Corvette a Corvette in the mother.

777
01:33:11,189 --> 01:33:18,339
So again. So that's why this SVP. So the in this case, what is a zero?

778
01:33:20,829 --> 01:33:27,629
Theta zero is. Meanwhile SVP.

779
01:33:28,769 --> 01:33:33,609
When? Asia. Equal to two zero.

780
01:33:34,549 --> 01:33:41,149
Right. So that's why in your population, especially your population, is dirt.

781
01:33:41,269 --> 01:33:46,759
So that's why SDP more important or respectable, in other words.

782
01:33:47,179 --> 01:33:53,269
So then age equal to zero zero aids in your population is doesn't make sense.

783
01:33:53,299 --> 01:33:57,368
Right. So that's why you are calculating this virus.

784
01:33:57,369 --> 01:34:01,959
Zero. It may not reflect the true mean value in your population.

785
01:34:03,119 --> 01:34:06,479
So what is the strategy? How how do you handle this?

786
01:34:07,109 --> 01:34:14,219
You have seen this before, right? How do we handle this issue to get the right beat at zero?

787
01:34:14,969 --> 01:34:19,039
We sent her. Okay.

788
01:34:23,029 --> 01:34:26,959
So that's what you're subtracting. Eight minus mean eight.

789
01:34:27,529 --> 01:34:33,549
Right. Let's say median age 40.

790
01:34:34,399 --> 01:34:41,629
So then what does this data zero mean? So this is mean.

791
01:34:43,399 --> 01:34:49,669
As we peer when. Age is equal to 40.

792
01:34:50,899 --> 01:35:03,129
Right. Going back to our previous series, Emperor.

793
01:35:04,429 --> 01:35:09,019
Let's say you are. You have. This is a queer leather lover, right?

794
01:35:11,459 --> 01:35:19,109
And then here you will have. Smoking status smoking status three lover.

795
01:35:19,119 --> 01:35:24,729
So that's so you would have to dummy very over right so that's why the former smoker.

796
01:35:26,519 --> 01:35:38,099
Federal troops have been up to speed, up to be coroner, a smoker and never a smoker as the reference group OC.

797
01:35:39,229 --> 01:35:46,539
So then. What is the meaning of key below the level for never smoker.

798
01:35:49,619 --> 01:36:01,739
Which better question? From this. It gives us a major surplus demand.

799
01:36:03,299 --> 01:36:11,949
Right. So all. So the when never smoker it means that former smoker equal to zero current smoker equal to zero.

800
01:36:12,219 --> 01:36:16,059
Right. So that's what is this true term cancer.

801
01:36:17,169 --> 01:36:20,349
And then that's why this will give you.

802
01:36:22,149 --> 01:36:27,069
Mean of SBP a mino kebab lover with a never smoker.

803
01:36:28,449 --> 01:36:40,619
Former smoker when ETFs equal one. And then current smoke we've got to zero so that's why you add up energy and the beta two so that is.

804
01:36:41,799 --> 01:36:50,709
Your typical for former smoker and their current smoker is when FC equals zero and that this is one.

805
01:36:52,099 --> 01:36:58,129
So that's why beta zero plus beta three. So that is how the previous table one calculated.

806
01:36:59,129 --> 01:37:03,239
Okay. So that's why I want to.

807
01:37:03,279 --> 01:37:13,659
So that's why the adjustment or like a centering and then calculating all these the intercept beta zero, beta one, beta two.

808
01:37:14,109 --> 01:37:17,318
So the goal or what I am doing.

809
01:37:17,319 --> 01:37:25,089
So what we are doing right now is you want to understand how you interpret all these parameters from your mother.

810
01:37:25,479 --> 01:37:34,379
Okay. And then to better understand all their first areas, write out your equation.

811
01:37:35,969 --> 01:37:45,419
After you write out. Based on how you modder write and then get your output, then you can properly interpret this.

812
01:37:48,099 --> 01:37:56,689
So this exercise is very important. Okay. So back to age, you know, just to be able to deliver.

813
01:37:56,699 --> 01:38:00,389
So then, okay, so this.

814
01:38:02,029 --> 01:38:06,469
We already mentioned here. So this age or just to this.

815
01:38:08,579 --> 01:38:12,029
So this is. Without.

816
01:38:13,159 --> 01:38:17,079
This age. Or send today's.

817
01:38:21,999 --> 01:38:25,379
In the Mulder. This is weird.

818
01:38:26,049 --> 01:38:33,959
This centered. Age in the modern right.

819
01:38:34,619 --> 01:38:39,389
And then using that information, you can calculate that. But we will try to.

820
01:38:39,539 --> 01:38:47,389
So this is again, this is one way. So we will try to calculate this in different way, not using the of AIDS.

821
01:38:48,269 --> 01:38:51,629
This is because I want you to calculate what.

822
01:38:53,019 --> 01:39:05,119
Standard better. And then if we are doing center aid and then you can calculate this point estimate so the mean

823
01:39:05,839 --> 01:39:11,449
but you are not able to calculate the standard error and the making up significance testing.

824
01:39:12,019 --> 01:39:17,539
So that's why we will try the approach we looked at before.

825
01:39:17,989 --> 01:39:22,849
So we will try using this approach. Build a mother.

826
01:39:23,209 --> 01:39:26,868
Get rid of your. And then calculate.

827
01:39:26,869 --> 01:39:33,339
Is expected to value. For the mean age and then adult years.

828
01:39:33,759 --> 01:39:39,759
And then so that you are creating this new video, we're now using this new variable you are calculating.

829
01:39:43,949 --> 01:39:52,409
The main value for each group and the Senate that stand on the standard deviation as presented in this paper.

830
01:39:52,949 --> 01:39:56,599
So this is standard deviation. Okay.

831
01:39:59,369 --> 01:40:05,039
All right. Let's quickly do this using our.

832
01:40:11,409 --> 01:40:24,379
Okay. Let's open our. So this if we go to for those who have not downloaded yet.

833
01:40:24,539 --> 01:40:29,739
So if you go to. Linear Regression Model Week two.

834
01:40:30,519 --> 01:40:37,238
So please download this week to age adjusted additional code that are so open.

835
01:40:37,239 --> 01:40:48,669
This are script. It's too small.

836
01:40:49,149 --> 01:40:52,539
The font is too small to let me try to.

837
01:40:54,109 --> 01:41:14,049
What options? Maybe that's better if you also need to download.

838
01:41:14,769 --> 01:41:22,299
Okay. Not here. Okay. Sorry. I had to put this dataset here and this in week one.

839
01:41:22,809 --> 01:41:30,799
So if you go to week one. Then please download this enhanced tree that says seven PDT.

840
01:41:30,929 --> 01:41:36,569
So we will be using this data. So this is in week one.

841
01:41:42,339 --> 01:41:50,589
Download this says seven bit data set and then put that into the same folder.

842
01:42:07,559 --> 01:42:13,099
Right. And I have to change my directory to see.

843
01:42:15,239 --> 01:42:21,269
And depending on your for that. So I assume that you all know how to define your working directory.

844
01:42:22,019 --> 01:42:33,079
Right. Okay. And you should have a more camp like a more long this directory location.

845
01:42:33,089 --> 01:42:36,269
So depending on whatever.

846
01:42:36,389 --> 01:42:42,869
So down. So put your dataset through your working folder and then run this.

847
01:42:44,849 --> 01:42:48,419
Are you ready? Everyone is ready. Okay.

848
01:42:48,629 --> 01:42:51,629
All right. So then define our work into a career.

849
01:42:57,359 --> 01:43:04,419
So this is also part of the big one. But let me. Activate all of this.

850
01:43:06,639 --> 01:43:11,679
Okay. So the as you probably know.

851
01:43:12,129 --> 01:43:16,659
So reading sets, data set. So there are many different packages.

852
01:43:16,849 --> 01:43:20,339
But I think that this is the best one haven't.

853
01:43:21,249 --> 01:43:29,199
So we will use this library have. And so if we do not have this package, then everyone knows how to install the packages.

854
01:43:29,319 --> 01:43:41,819
Right. So go to on the right lower path packages and then in store and then put this happen right to that.

855
01:43:41,829 --> 01:43:46,519
And they used to your packages. So.

856
01:43:46,519 --> 01:43:53,679
Ron. Oh, no. So. Well, you have to consider this.

857
01:44:00,679 --> 01:44:18,769
Right. All right, then I'll order Liberia.

858
01:44:23,839 --> 01:44:33,329
And then read so you didn't the function read on the score says and then we will read these and they go.

859
01:44:34,729 --> 01:44:40,399
So let me stop here. I want to make sure everyone you loaded this data dataset.

860
01:44:46,669 --> 01:44:51,199
Everyone applauded this data. Anyone still working?

861
01:44:52,609 --> 01:44:56,089
It's okay. Raise your hand. Let me do it.

862
01:44:56,179 --> 01:45:12,589
Keep doing. So just in case.

863
01:45:12,739 --> 01:45:16,009
So as you also know, there are.

864
01:45:17,479 --> 01:45:25,699
So when you define your directory and the you you have to use for the slash not bad with the slash.

865
01:45:25,789 --> 01:45:34,509
Right. So if that is the case and then if you are not able to define your working directory.

866
01:45:35,769 --> 01:45:41,479
And please change this slash either forward slash or double parallel to slash.

867
01:45:41,849 --> 01:46:01,439
Okay. So it's a no win.

868
01:46:01,929 --> 01:46:05,989
Good. So limit lending. Okay. Okay.

869
01:46:07,199 --> 01:46:12,659
Good. All right. So then let's take a look at the data set.

870
01:46:13,229 --> 01:46:18,209
So names a function. We'll show you what variable we have.

871
01:46:28,379 --> 01:46:37,049
And then later, as you may also know, so we do not want to, you know, import this test dataset all the time.

872
01:46:37,049 --> 01:46:41,429
So I want to make our data set. So please save.

873
01:46:42,779 --> 01:46:56,099
Is as are they to Seth. So let's save this as a and history the idea for the next time instead of we are reading our success data again.

874
01:46:56,219 --> 01:47:00,149
So let me again make this inactivate this part.

875
01:47:01,259 --> 01:47:07,229
We do not want to repeat this. And the next time we will directly just a load of this data.

876
01:47:08,229 --> 01:47:08,469
Okay.

877
01:47:12,109 --> 01:47:22,728
And this is my personal preference, and I know some may not like this, but I do not want to hide the data set all the time, especially in this class.

878
01:47:22,729 --> 01:47:30,319
We are using only a single data set. So that's why it's better to just attach data and we don't need to type data in name.

879
01:47:30,799 --> 01:47:36,939
So attach this data. Okay.

880
01:47:40,509 --> 01:47:51,429
All right. So the goal of this modeling is that as we take the paper so that we level ever, which is dependent or dependent on age.

881
01:47:51,639 --> 01:47:59,889
So that's why we want to we wanted to calculate age adjusted piano lover, but brother lady, a source of function of age.

882
01:48:00,249 --> 01:48:05,439
So that's why in this case, we want to calculate age adjusted below the level of her.

883
01:48:06,429 --> 01:48:17,559
Okay. And then calculate summary statistic of a zero adjusted bladder leather lover by gender education and other variables.

884
01:48:18,129 --> 01:48:22,019
That's the goal of this exercise. Okay. So that's why.

885
01:48:22,029 --> 01:48:23,649
Let's run the model.

886
01:48:27,199 --> 01:48:41,219
And everyone knows this linear model is and function a linear model and and then modeling in R is your outcome tilde your exposure.

887
01:48:42,369 --> 01:48:46,479
And then when you have, let's put a variable to add the using plus assign.

888
01:48:47,349 --> 01:48:51,449
Okay. And then you can define your data set.

889
01:48:52,049 --> 01:49:00,359
In this case, because we are using only one data dataset even without data or to an industry here, actually it should do should it be working?

890
01:49:00,929 --> 01:49:07,489
But let's say we define the data set. And they look at the summary.

891
01:49:08,689 --> 01:49:12,049
So this is what we already look at before.

892
01:49:13,599 --> 01:49:17,859
Well, actually, not because this is bloodline, not systolic blood pressure.

893
01:49:18,519 --> 01:49:26,049
Okay. So that, again, when you look at the output from the read, you do what you are looking for.

894
01:49:27,659 --> 01:49:36,849
What do you want to see from this regional distribution? Weather is normally the weather, it is normally distributed.

895
01:49:37,449 --> 01:49:46,359
So that's why the the parameter so the statistic showing here do you like this distribution numbers.

896
01:49:50,029 --> 01:49:53,389
Why not? It's not.

897
01:49:55,009 --> 01:49:59,569
It's not enough. It's not normal. So how did you decide that?

898
01:50:03,949 --> 01:50:10,519
Maximum is the maximum is greater than one.

899
01:50:19,529 --> 01:50:28,559
So normal distribution means that mean is mean equal to zero and that's symmetric, right?

900
01:50:28,649 --> 01:50:35,449
So that's so that is what we want to see. And then median is a good estimate.

901
01:50:36,769 --> 01:50:43,519
But comparing medium versus me, this media is different from zero, right?

902
01:50:44,659 --> 01:50:56,639
Point eight. And the mean is negative for a minimum, the maximum is 43, which means that it is highly skilled to the where.

903
01:50:58,729 --> 01:51:02,479
So. So. Right. Maximum, right.

904
01:51:05,879 --> 01:51:14,179
So that's why. I think we all agree that this distribution or distribution doesn't look good.

905
01:51:14,839 --> 01:51:20,269
Right. And that's why I will not even consider even interpreting this number.

906
01:51:20,569 --> 01:51:26,299
Okay, go back. So that's why you want to check the distribution of origin.

907
01:51:26,299 --> 01:51:30,289
You are right. So that's why the function read you are.

908
01:51:31,989 --> 01:51:35,929
We can calculate what is the distribution of this summary but we only detect.

909
01:51:35,949 --> 01:51:41,659
So I will not run. But you can also get read it out from the mother and then check the summary.

910
01:51:42,819 --> 01:51:48,699
But let's make a plot. Okay. So, Paula and Richard, you're.

911
01:51:51,109 --> 01:51:54,349
And then we want to see how the rejiggered.

912
01:51:55,509 --> 01:52:00,099
Just visual look like. And then we are putting this line.

913
01:52:01,479 --> 01:52:05,529
And then Lois Bombshell. So it's okay.

914
01:52:05,529 --> 01:52:09,369
Just move on. Without the ladle, we will cover.

915
01:52:09,399 --> 01:52:19,929
What is the lowest function? But this is one of the the smoothing acne to put this through like a smoothing line from older.

916
01:52:20,439 --> 01:52:29,279
So adding these. And there you can see this overall trend distribution of this the region here.

917
01:52:30,059 --> 01:52:34,379
And what we want to see from here is the retailer.

918
01:52:34,679 --> 01:52:39,129
There is no typical pattern randomly distributed.

919
01:52:41,599 --> 01:52:54,289
And do you see that? Maybe the parent bedroom alter is better function is histogram.

920
01:53:01,389 --> 01:53:07,719
Running this and then. It doesn't look lunar, right?

921
01:53:08,669 --> 01:53:17,269
So that's why we don't like this product. And that's why we can run additional mother.

922
01:53:17,269 --> 01:53:21,469
But let me. So even though that's the case, let me just.

923
01:53:22,249 --> 01:53:28,489
We are not using law transformation because law transformation is what we will be doing next week.

924
01:53:29,149 --> 01:53:32,449
Okay. So that is not what we want to try today.

925
01:53:34,619 --> 01:53:40,279
So even though the mother. Violate this normal distribution assumption.

926
01:53:40,849 --> 01:53:45,409
Let's move on. Okay. Okay.

927
01:53:45,419 --> 01:53:57,568
So then the, the, what we just discussed is to calculate age adjusted below the level of her we need is what is the bloodline,

928
01:53:57,569 --> 01:54:02,029
the love, her full mean age. Okay. How can you get.

929
01:54:03,189 --> 01:54:08,379
You can get that using plug plug in this mean a to the smaller.

930
01:54:11,359 --> 01:54:20,829
Okay. So from this Mulder interest areas 2.386767.

931
01:54:22,149 --> 01:54:27,429
Put this. Better question for age is here.

932
01:54:27,669 --> 01:54:33,659
.032235. And then probably in this mean age.

933
01:54:36,589 --> 01:54:45,049
So I don't know how how many of you are comfortable or familiar with this type of modeling?

934
01:54:45,799 --> 01:54:59,359
So in our mean age, even though this is a constant, we can use this function as a comment when you do your calculation.

935
01:55:00,229 --> 01:55:07,579
Okay. So that's why you can directly add this 48.74 to this calculation.

936
01:55:08,479 --> 01:55:13,689
But another one is you are just simply putting this function. To your calculation.

937
01:55:17,549 --> 01:55:24,869
But then expected the value of mean or plot another lover for the sofa that we.

938
01:55:26,089 --> 01:55:31,739
AJ 48.74 years. You're running this.

939
01:55:32,429 --> 01:55:35,569
This is that. That is 3.958.

940
01:55:37,479 --> 01:55:45,579
So in this population. The subject with 48 seven for a year expected.

941
01:55:45,579 --> 01:55:50,219
The value of a lot of leather lover is. 3.95.

942
01:55:52,409 --> 01:55:56,329
Hey. This is a model estimated.

943
01:55:57,979 --> 01:56:06,259
A sort of mean brother lover. Okay.

944
01:56:11,939 --> 01:56:14,129
So that is the line 31 years.

945
01:56:14,129 --> 01:56:25,169
And so when you run any regression model, then if you want to see so what information this model provide, then you can chat using this attribute.

946
01:56:26,129 --> 01:56:32,399
Okay, so for example, this linear regression modeling and then you will run this attribute,

947
01:56:32,819 --> 01:56:42,449
then this model provides the coefficient of your information effect rank fit to the value and many other this information.

948
01:56:42,749 --> 01:56:47,249
Okay. So you can extract this as an object from the mother.

949
01:56:48,669 --> 01:56:54,189
By putting these. At Trivia after nine.

950
01:56:56,999 --> 01:57:09,239
Okay. So that's why the next line to what this line is doing is, oh, we want we want, want to see coefficient of this mother.

951
01:57:12,439 --> 01:57:24,199
Okay. So that's why you are extracting the equation. Which is intercept 2.38 beta four eight is .03.

952
01:57:28,619 --> 01:57:34,259
Another way is using the palms and that this will give you your regression table.

953
01:57:34,469 --> 01:57:45,419
So if you run this. And then what kind of calms are available in this moderate?

954
01:57:51,169 --> 01:57:57,109
And another from another op ed that we get is the summary function.

955
01:57:58,679 --> 01:58:03,509
So that's why let's take a look at what attribute available within the summary function.

956
01:58:05,559 --> 01:58:10,539
But then the same one. What is the model?

957
01:58:10,809 --> 01:58:17,999
What kind of promo available with your question and other features of this regression model?

958
01:58:20,019 --> 01:58:26,739
So that's why we can take a look at the summary PPV that AIDS and the using this coefficient.

959
01:58:28,529 --> 01:58:32,579
If we can get this regression paper from our paper.

960
01:58:33,359 --> 01:58:38,819
So this is not new. So regression of what you already see before there's.

961
01:58:41,089 --> 01:58:44,449
So out of this many information from regression.

962
01:58:46,069 --> 01:58:49,979
You're putting this summary, your maiden name the.

963
01:58:51,639 --> 01:58:58,529
Toms, then you will not talk coefficient, then you will extract this piece.

964
01:58:59,629 --> 01:59:08,029
Okay. So I want you to get used to this because throughout this class we will use this a lot.

965
01:59:15,349 --> 01:59:26,209
This is because, as we did before. So one way or calculating is no mean brother Latin lover for the self-identity.

966
01:59:26,209 --> 01:59:35,329
The mean age is your manually putting this intercept to point to the aid and then manually adding bait operation.

967
01:59:35,359 --> 01:59:40,129
This is one way, but we want to get out of this approach.

968
01:59:40,669 --> 01:59:46,849
We want to use this modder we've shown and they're using this matrix.

969
01:59:48,869 --> 01:59:53,279
Okay. So that's why I hear.

970
02:00:00,029 --> 02:00:08,169
And so that's why this is somebody's question.

971
02:00:09,309 --> 02:00:12,489
And then what is the dimension of this matrix?

972
02:00:19,169 --> 02:00:26,969
How many role it has. Q How many columns?

973
02:00:29,119 --> 02:00:33,409
So that's right. The demands on role first column later.

974
02:00:34,129 --> 02:00:38,239
So that's why this is a two by four matrix.

975
02:00:38,859 --> 02:00:44,679
Okay. So then I want to get interested.

976
02:00:44,919 --> 02:00:48,389
So then. What is the demand? And I'll be interested in.

977
02:00:54,609 --> 02:00:59,769
When I first saw her. One by one. One camera.

978
02:01:00,279 --> 02:01:04,299
Okay. What is the dimension of AIDS?

979
02:01:06,929 --> 02:01:10,109
Ta ta. Let's.

980
02:01:10,319 --> 02:01:13,889
Let's use common. Okay. So come to camel.

981
02:01:14,549 --> 02:01:21,259
Okay. If we want to extract, stand on the head or so that we stand on the arrow of AIDS.

982
02:01:24,639 --> 02:01:30,369
To commit to. If we want to get p value over AIDS then.

983
02:01:32,419 --> 02:01:35,749
So I to come up here. Okay.

984
02:01:37,789 --> 02:01:47,739
Right. Not if occur. So that's why instead of manually putting that number, I want you to do it.

985
02:01:47,829 --> 02:01:52,539
Okay. So then I want to get intercept from the motor.

986
02:01:53,259 --> 02:01:56,379
Then you are. You do summary your mother.

987
02:01:57,759 --> 02:02:03,068
Coefficient brackets are the matrix and the.

988
02:02:03,069 --> 02:02:08,049
When you place the location make matrix, you are using this bracket.

989
02:02:08,439 --> 02:02:14,589
Okay, bracket, roll number, comma, column, column number.

990
02:02:14,829 --> 02:02:18,729
Okay. So that's the intercept which is located in.

991
02:02:19,769 --> 02:02:24,809
One comma one. So that's why this fall Michelle will give you.

992
02:02:24,929 --> 02:02:29,669
So you are extracting intercept. Okay.

993
02:02:32,009 --> 02:02:37,379
2.38. Right. So come on.

994
02:02:37,389 --> 02:02:41,499
You are extracting beta coefficient for eight.

995
02:02:43,019 --> 02:02:49,589
If we also want to extract standard aero for AIDS, then you are using this bracket to combat.

996
02:02:50,459 --> 02:02:53,609
Okay, so that's like going back to the same way.

997
02:02:53,999 --> 02:02:57,809
What is the actually I should look why I put there.

998
02:02:58,439 --> 02:03:04,768
Okay. So forget about 41 941 so don't don't look at that just by you.

999
02:03:04,769 --> 02:03:14,549
It's the fourth space. Okay, then try let's try to calculate what is the mean, brother?

1000
02:03:14,549 --> 02:03:19,319
Let the lover for the subject with mean age using this bracket system.

1001
02:04:13,249 --> 02:04:16,789
Okay. So we are using.

1002
02:04:18,549 --> 02:04:26,799
Intercessor and then question for aid and then we are adding.

1003
02:04:27,549 --> 02:04:32,829
So multiply by mean age so combination we will get.

1004
02:04:35,359 --> 02:04:41,479
Mean bloody Latin lover for the supposed to be the mean age which is 3.95 OC.

1005
02:04:44,579 --> 02:04:49,439
So when you do your homework like homework too. So after the class, I will post.

1006
02:04:50,889 --> 02:04:58,329
And then you do this exercise. Okay. So even though, you know, just not so they're on that menu.

1007
02:04:58,329 --> 02:05:04,209
So that's a for this specific moment. Just manually typing your intercept operation.

1008
02:05:04,209 --> 02:05:07,839
Probably it's easier, right? But don't use that.

1009
02:05:08,469 --> 02:05:13,759
Okay? Try to use this breakfast system so you get used to using this approach.

1010
02:05:13,779 --> 02:05:18,099
Okay. What's the difference between using the arrows and the easiest line?

1011
02:05:19,959 --> 02:05:25,899
Arrow actually the same. So here you can use instead of this arrow, you can use this.

1012
02:05:26,319 --> 02:05:32,109
It's fine. Okay. So a single equal sign is the equivalent to a assigning.

1013
02:05:40,459 --> 02:05:44,179
Okay. So then think again.

1014
02:05:44,299 --> 02:05:51,169
So you are calculating the region, your region distribution meaning equal to zero.

1015
02:05:51,349 --> 02:05:56,869
So that's why the summary statistic from the distribution doesn't sound good, right?

1016
02:05:56,879 --> 02:06:03,109
Doesn't look good. So that's why we are we want to shift this distribution by adding a constant.

1017
02:06:03,679 --> 02:06:06,709
So that's why you are added. You are getting this region.

1018
02:06:06,709 --> 02:06:13,038
You are. Right. And a summary of retail.

1019
02:06:13,039 --> 02:06:16,219
We all have a tech mean equal to zero. Right.

1020
02:06:17,929 --> 02:06:21,139
We already checked before, but let's take a look again.

1021
02:06:21,709 --> 02:06:25,309
Summary. We know this mother.

1022
02:06:26,709 --> 02:06:29,709
So mean is zero, right?

1023
02:06:30,039 --> 02:06:34,219
We come from -0. So that's why.

1024
02:06:35,699 --> 02:06:40,389
And then calculating mean for each group. Still, it's very close to zero.

1025
02:06:40,409 --> 02:06:50,129
It doesn't reflect true below the level ever. So that's why we are seeing a constant shift in this distribution by adding this constant.

1026
02:06:50,759 --> 02:06:58,639
And actually what we just calculate was x one. We should also confirm that the residuals have equal variance.

1027
02:06:59,749 --> 02:07:05,689
Yeah. So again, so that's why the after we cover local transformation and that we will get there.

1028
02:07:06,809 --> 02:07:10,559
Okay. So today, even though this mother is not perfect.

1029
02:07:10,559 --> 02:07:25,589
Mother. Let's move on. So that's what rejigger and then adding this constant.

1030
02:07:25,829 --> 02:07:32,969
So that's what we are calculating this age adjusted blood alcohol level for each of that.

1031
02:07:33,779 --> 02:07:39,039
And we are creating this vector. This is a new variable.

1032
02:07:39,639 --> 02:07:46,449
Right. So that's why let's say this vector or new variable is adjusted bloodletting number.

1033
02:07:47,079 --> 02:07:52,939
So this name. So I always I didn't actually explain this before, but, you know, any name is fine.

1034
02:07:53,349 --> 02:07:59,739
But you better make a more a region of the name of your object in this case, vector.

1035
02:08:00,729 --> 02:08:04,869
So creating this new vector, which is adjusted below the level of earth.

1036
02:08:05,999 --> 02:08:13,949
And let's take all of summary for a just a little over and then crude or roll or the letter level.

1037
02:08:14,749 --> 02:08:26,079
Hey. What do you see? Well-adjusted brother, leather lover.

1038
02:08:26,099 --> 02:08:30,659
What is the mean? 3.958. What is the crude?

1039
02:08:31,849 --> 02:08:37,069
Mean or other Latin lover, which is 3.958 the same.

1040
02:08:37,959 --> 02:08:44,139
So by adding this miracle other Latin lover for that Cuban salve that we are shifting.

1041
02:08:44,289 --> 02:08:48,889
But mean doesn't change. Right. The one I did from.

1042
02:08:50,759 --> 02:08:56,549
Media. Different interquartile range, a different maximum minimum are all different.

1043
02:08:57,119 --> 02:09:03,069
Right? Which means the distribution of this adjustable other leather lover.

1044
02:09:03,279 --> 02:09:08,079
Now we are accounting for age effect. So that's why this very over.

1045
02:09:09,679 --> 02:09:14,969
Is independent of eight. However crude the BP.

1046
02:09:15,929 --> 02:09:26,819
It's not independent of page. You know, what I'm talking about now is too valuable to be priced right.

1047
02:09:28,489 --> 02:09:35,568
So that's why using these ideas to plot a Latin lover and then we can calculate what is the

1048
02:09:35,569 --> 02:09:45,799
mean and standard deviation of this very over by sex and then race and education and so on.

1049
02:09:46,559 --> 02:09:51,379
Okay. I know some of you may not know to apply.

1050
02:09:51,589 --> 02:10:00,169
So for those who are more familiar with assess than to apply is equivalent to prop means and class statement.

1051
02:10:00,619 --> 02:10:13,749
Okay. So that's why I want to apply this main function to this variable plot led by is categorical variable.

1052
02:10:13,759 --> 02:10:23,209
So that's a t apply parenthesis continuous variable comma categorical variable comma statistic you want to calculate.

1053
02:10:24,479 --> 02:10:32,219
Okay. And then when there are any missing value, you want to say that or how you want to handle a missing value.

1054
02:10:32,519 --> 02:10:41,779
So and that our m so if there are any missing value and a missing, then remove an equal to true.

1055
02:10:42,029 --> 02:10:54,659
So that's why any missing value just simply remove. So then we can see now a 5.0 by 3.02.

1056
02:10:55,319 --> 02:10:58,919
So one indicate made to indicate female.

1057
02:11:00,569 --> 02:11:05,909
So that's why the mean operator ladder lover is 5.05.

1058
02:11:06,659 --> 02:11:12,359
For female 3.02. And their standard deviation.

1059
02:11:13,899 --> 02:11:26,949
3.672.42. Let me skip the line 55 and 53, then move to line 50 a.

1060
02:11:29,889 --> 02:11:32,919
So then what is the age adjusted below the level ever?

1061
02:11:34,399 --> 02:11:40,969
So that's why I run this line. 3.03.

1062
02:11:43,119 --> 02:11:48,129
So then you can see that slightly changed. But we are eliminate this age effect.

1063
02:11:50,569 --> 02:11:58,689
So do you see the crude? Balotelli the lover. For each group and their adjusted level for each group.

1064
02:11:59,859 --> 02:12:03,249
Okay. So this difference.

1065
02:12:03,309 --> 02:12:06,519
So 5.05 -3.02.

1066
02:12:06,729 --> 02:12:09,969
So that difference is not independent of the AIDS.

1067
02:12:10,749 --> 02:12:20,379
So that's why if you are using the number and then comparison significance testing, then that testing is not independent of AIDS.

1068
02:12:20,439 --> 02:12:27,369
So that's a confounded by AIDS. If you want to make a proper comparison, you are doing comparison.

1069
02:12:27,369 --> 02:12:31,389
Using is 5.3 -3.04.

1070
02:12:32,049 --> 02:12:40,519
That difference is independent of AIDS. This is the kind of civil adjustment.

1071
02:12:41,739 --> 02:12:47,489
Hey. Not difficult.

1072
02:12:47,589 --> 02:12:52,009
Right. Clear. Good. Okay.

1073
02:12:53,419 --> 02:12:57,269
So the rest of them is just a different, you know, group.

1074
02:12:57,289 --> 02:13:01,549
So in this case, so a comparing male and female.

1075
02:13:01,799 --> 02:13:05,179
And the next one is, you know, black and white.

1076
02:13:05,809 --> 02:13:17,209
And you can see that. So like 61, 62 is, uh, on the unadjusted comparison lines, 64, three and 64 is a delta comparison.

1077
02:13:17,569 --> 02:13:21,469
Okay. And the 66, 67 is education.

1078
02:13:22,249 --> 02:13:25,399
So you're not wrong, but you have to do that. Okay.

1079
02:13:26,409 --> 02:13:30,199
And the smoking ads were. Okay.

1080
02:13:31,809 --> 02:13:41,079
All right. Actually, I wanted to take an additional ten minute frame of 1124.

1081
02:13:41,469 --> 02:13:48,069
If we have a ten minute break, then. So let's move on and then let's end this little bit earlier.

1082
02:13:48,459 --> 02:13:53,139
Does it hurt? Is it better? Right. Okay. All right. Okay.

1083
02:13:53,499 --> 02:13:58,449
So then stop here and then move to the slide again.

1084
02:14:03,899 --> 02:14:08,009
And so how many?

1085
02:14:09,329 --> 02:14:14,818
Uh, have more of a geometric mean. Oh, so I know geometric.

1086
02:14:14,819 --> 02:14:19,979
Mean. What it is. Okay.

1087
02:14:21,669 --> 02:14:27,129
I have calculated you missing me before. Okay.

1088
02:14:27,399 --> 02:14:28,719
Not many. Okay. All right.

1089
02:14:29,349 --> 02:14:43,539
So then, you know, so we will try this geometric mean in this class a lot and this is because environmental, chemical exposure or almost all.

1090
02:14:44,519 --> 02:14:47,739
Skewed. Pretty great, so very often.

1091
02:14:47,889 --> 02:14:55,659
So that's why arithmetic me does not provide the proper summary statistic.

1092
02:14:56,529 --> 02:15:01,239
So instead of using arithmetic mean we better use different statistics.

1093
02:15:01,629 --> 02:15:07,099
So one option is geometry. Another option, maybe you can use just medium.

1094
02:15:07,579 --> 02:15:17,859
Okay. So that definition of geometric me, it's a mathematical definition and the root of the problem and number even I do not know what that mean.

1095
02:15:17,899 --> 02:15:24,469
Right. So more likely, this practical definition, how to calculate this geometric mean.

1096
02:15:24,889 --> 02:15:30,529
So when you have a highly skilled. But not to the lack.

1097
02:15:31,539 --> 02:15:38,479
To the right. Because law transformation is you are shrinking extreme value to the right.

1098
02:15:38,489 --> 02:15:43,369
So larger value to the toward the smaller value.

1099
02:15:43,789 --> 02:15:50,539
And then that's why you are normalizing the distribution. So when you have a right skew the very over.

1100
02:15:52,019 --> 02:15:58,199
Logo transform. And then calculate the average overload, transform the variables.

1101
02:15:58,229 --> 02:16:02,189
So that's what arithmetic mean of global.

1102
02:16:02,189 --> 02:16:13,239
Transform the value over. And that bad calculation that law would transform so exponentially that average is geometric.

1103
02:16:16,139 --> 02:16:20,039
Okay. Okay. You have a highly skewed.

1104
02:16:21,379 --> 02:16:28,469
Right. Q The variable you have. We have a highly skilled variable, something like this.

1105
02:16:29,249 --> 02:16:32,849
So when you have this type of very overt. So that's a low transform.

1106
02:16:32,879 --> 02:16:37,949
Let's say this is X. You know, transform X.

1107
02:16:39,059 --> 02:16:44,719
And then you are calculating average. Or.

1108
02:16:46,969 --> 02:16:52,279
LOL. Thanks. This is not good.

1109
02:16:56,179 --> 02:17:02,659
And then back calculate for exponential exponential than me use not average.

1110
02:17:02,679 --> 02:17:08,359
Mm. Just me. Because this is the r function you are using mean.

1111
02:17:10,879 --> 02:17:14,719
Thanks. So this is domestic?

1112
02:17:14,749 --> 02:17:20,229
Yeah. Okay. So.

1113
02:17:20,499 --> 02:17:25,949
Lomax. Sorry. Long. Mix.

1114
02:17:29,599 --> 02:17:38,699
Yeah. When I. When I touched this screen, I think a little bit longer than this horizontal line just happened.

1115
02:17:38,909 --> 02:17:43,439
I don't know how I can avoid this, prevent this, but.

1116
02:17:46,049 --> 02:17:49,439
Okay. And then geometric standard deviation.

1117
02:17:49,449 --> 02:17:54,539
Yes. Again, you are calculating standard deviation of.

1118
02:17:56,209 --> 02:18:00,709
Love asks. And then explanation.

1119
02:18:01,599 --> 02:18:06,609
Standard deviation log. X.

1120
02:18:07,719 --> 02:18:11,559
Is this a geometric stand out, a deviation?

1121
02:18:13,109 --> 02:18:19,579
Okay. All right. So then, Eugene, uh.

1122
02:18:20,629 --> 02:18:24,379
Ah, don't use Excel or any calculator.

1123
02:18:24,389 --> 02:18:27,769
Just simply use. Ah, and let's compute.

1124
02:18:28,069 --> 02:18:31,819
Mean standard deviation. Geometric mean and geometric.

1125
02:18:31,819 --> 02:18:56,759
Standard deviation. All of this five number. And as I said, mean function is doesn't mean SD is lowercase sd.

1126
02:19:40,419 --> 02:19:44,109
I'm. I had.

1127
02:20:15,479 --> 02:20:35,089
I. Even.

1128
02:21:32,239 --> 02:21:44,109
Okay. So let's check this together. Then in our.

1129
02:21:45,959 --> 02:21:54,559
We can. You can create a vector of this five area over.

1130
02:21:54,859 --> 02:21:58,819
So you can we can use, let's say, events or the Z vector Z.

1131
02:22:01,249 --> 02:22:06,439
And they're using the same function like previous books.

1132
02:22:07,639 --> 02:22:10,919
Five number. Okay.

1133
02:22:11,699 --> 02:22:16,619
And then mean there, which is 253.

1134
02:22:18,649 --> 02:22:25,929
Standard deviation there. 529, which is much bigger than me.

1135
02:22:25,989 --> 02:22:29,469
Right. This is indication of skewness.

1136
02:22:30,619 --> 02:22:37,008
So that's why, rather than just reporting this mean arithmetic, mean and standard deviation,

1137
02:22:37,009 --> 02:22:44,209
we want to calculate low transport and Z and then calculate geometric mean.

1138
02:22:44,689 --> 02:22:49,669
So that's why we want to calculate a so wrong mean but not z.

1139
02:22:50,059 --> 02:22:54,679
Which one? Low Z. Okay.

1140
02:22:56,769 --> 02:23:02,709
That's 3.27. So this is arithmetic mean of global transform the.

1141
02:23:03,309 --> 02:23:09,579
So that's why. Geometry means you have to it back.

1142
02:23:09,609 --> 02:23:19,929
Calculate this. Right. So again, I can also use a number from the previous output, but my suggestion is don't try that.

1143
02:23:20,589 --> 02:23:27,009
So from now on throughout this class and in the future, try to use this function.

1144
02:23:27,789 --> 02:23:36,518
Okay. And then you are expanding this. So first step is load transform so that for, you know, the the order of this parenthesis.

1145
02:23:36,519 --> 02:23:40,629
Right. The within this space.

1146
02:23:40,689 --> 02:23:43,749
So this is the first step lo transformation.

1147
02:23:44,589 --> 02:23:51,429
Next step is calculating mean and the final step is explaining, shading this.

1148
02:23:51,939 --> 02:23:57,489
Okay. What is it? 26.45.

1149
02:23:57,819 --> 02:24:03,729
So this is geometric mean, which is very different from arithmetic mean.

1150
02:24:05,379 --> 02:24:12,489
Right. What is geometric standard deviation? So instead of me, you can use this as the.

1151
02:24:14,339 --> 02:24:20,079
Which is part. Now. This is smaller than me, right?

1152
02:24:21,289 --> 02:24:29,029
It's not skewed, right? The previous standard deviation was 529, which is much bigger than me in value.

1153
02:24:29,299 --> 02:24:32,839
So that's why these are not proper.

1154
02:24:33,229 --> 02:24:38,989
Not a good summary statistic and you should not report this number in your paper.

1155
02:24:39,199 --> 02:24:41,778
So that's why when you look at some time, even, you know,

1156
02:24:41,779 --> 02:24:51,649
peer review the paper and we often see that mean and standard deviation and then sometimes standard deviation is much larger, does mean value.

1157
02:24:52,899 --> 02:25:00,009
Suggesting that they didn't provide the right statistic representative number because this number is.

1158
02:25:01,569 --> 02:25:09,039
Influenced by his outlier, right? The more proper, better summary statistic in this data is 26.

1159
02:25:11,669 --> 02:25:18,699
Okay. All right. So that's why the last piece of space this lab is there.

1160
02:25:20,009 --> 02:25:28,158
Let's take a look at the histogram of the level lever. We already actually tech the year before so he's still got below the level of our

1161
02:25:28,159 --> 02:25:35,509
highly secure let's turn it law transformation you know relieve this skewness.

1162
02:25:36,539 --> 02:25:41,249
So look at the local BPP. And it's not perfect, but.

1163
02:25:42,249 --> 02:25:48,579
Much better than before. Okay. And then this is because, as you can see here,

1164
02:25:48,939 --> 02:25:58,239
so this relatively large proportion of this one peg is those of us who have like a food concentration is below detection limit.

1165
02:25:58,899 --> 02:26:08,079
So that's why we do not know the actual concentration, and that's why we are just assigning a constant on those unknown value.

1166
02:26:08,259 --> 02:26:15,549
And that's why we have this larger here. So otherwise we may see relatively good normal distribution.

1167
02:26:16,479 --> 02:26:19,719
But anyway, so let's say this is a much better than before.

1168
02:26:21,299 --> 02:26:28,319
Okay. So that's why when you see these highly skilled, the very overt and, you know,

1169
02:26:28,589 --> 02:26:39,839
normalization by law transformation and then another another goal of law transformation is, as Maya mentioned, that.

1170
02:26:40,439 --> 02:26:43,859
So the constant variance is another assumption.

1171
02:26:43,979 --> 02:26:48,929
And then actually we will cover that next. We're not today but just briefly mentioned.

1172
02:26:49,349 --> 02:26:53,519
So a lot of transformation, you know, account for all this normalization.

1173
02:26:53,519 --> 02:26:57,379
So normal distribution address, achieving this constant variable.

1174
02:26:58,079 --> 02:27:01,229
And so that's why we are developing on other model.

1175
02:27:03,709 --> 02:27:08,329
Exactly the same. Except now I'll come functional for me as long.

1176
02:27:09,929 --> 02:27:14,859
Okay, Ron, there's. And then look at the summary.

1177
02:27:16,939 --> 02:27:30,119
So they here. Read it here. And actually based on this distribution, we may already expect how it look like and the median it's not perfect zero,

1178
02:27:30,119 --> 02:27:35,849
but actually this is closer to zero compared to the non-local transport model.

1179
02:27:36,389 --> 02:27:41,969
And then the difference between this maximum and minimum either side and then

1180
02:27:41,969 --> 02:27:49,549
interquartile range relatively they are not perfect but better symmetric distribution.

1181
02:27:49,949 --> 02:27:53,279
Okay. And then coefficient.

1182
02:27:54,999 --> 02:27:58,479
All right. So that's why using this milder.

1183
02:28:01,079 --> 02:28:15,669
We can calculate. So actually starting from line 89, we can also calculate this geometric mean but age adjusted geometric mean by different category.

1184
02:28:15,669 --> 02:28:19,119
So sex, race, ethnicity and education and so on.

1185
02:28:19,959 --> 02:28:31,519
But another model that I want to show you is. Because we you know from the lecture we look at their we can also calculate this centered approach.

1186
02:28:32,149 --> 02:28:40,409
Yeah. Using the centering. So that's why instead of putting eight, we are doing centering this eight.

1187
02:28:42,569 --> 02:28:48,309
Okay. So let's run this. And then look at the summary.

1188
02:28:51,769 --> 02:28:55,959
And so then this interest that.

1189
02:28:57,209 --> 02:29:04,619
Compared to the previous that. The previous intercept was point six.

1190
02:29:05,279 --> 02:29:16,259
So this is mean below the level of her actually lower transformed right mean low transformed below the level ever for ourselves that we age what?

1191
02:29:18,799 --> 02:29:23,719
Zero, right. Do we have zero aids in this population?

1192
02:29:23,729 --> 02:29:26,769
So this is a dance. Right. Minimum age is 20.

1193
02:29:26,779 --> 02:29:31,279
So that's why this intersect. So this value is.

1194
02:29:32,359 --> 02:29:35,869
Not within the population. This is extrapolation. Right.

1195
02:29:36,169 --> 02:29:41,909
So that's why this is not good number. Not a reasonable number.

1196
02:29:42,509 --> 02:29:49,019
The parent number is there. And I forgot what was the mean age in this population 48.

1197
02:29:49,229 --> 02:29:53,369
Right. So that's why this intercept which is.

1198
02:29:53,609 --> 02:30:00,059
Mean. Look at her for the subject with 8048.

1199
02:30:01,439 --> 02:30:06,299
Okay. That is in this population. That's why this is much better.

1200
02:30:06,929 --> 02:30:13,809
Summary statistics. So then what is the geometric mean?

1201
02:30:15,949 --> 02:30:20,389
Geometric mean or below the level of her but age adjusted.

1202
02:30:22,789 --> 02:31:25,438
Calculate. So that is actually the line 87 here is already here.

1203
02:31:25,439 --> 02:31:38,189
But let's use all the times I is suggesting that you are using this bracket system and then so the previously using the matrix,

1204
02:31:38,489 --> 02:31:47,049
so we can also use a matrix. One way is explanation and then summary.

1205
02:31:50,089 --> 02:32:04,389
No. Let's just comfortable with this. And then we are using the summary, uh, the orbits that then we have to use this one comma one.

1206
02:32:05,109 --> 02:32:12,609
Right. So summary this attribute sort of this creation matrix from the summary output

1207
02:32:12,609 --> 02:32:19,418
is this is matrix so that you have to define using this bracket matrix one,

1208
02:32:19,419 --> 02:32:31,119
comma, one. So if you do not need to extract the standard error or P value or P value, so that's why the matrix is not very important for you.

1209
02:32:31,539 --> 02:32:37,179
Then you can directly extract just using this modern name dial up coif.

1210
02:32:37,629 --> 02:32:41,979
And then because this is a vector, not matrix, we can just simply use one.

1211
02:32:42,459 --> 02:32:46,069
Okay. So either one is fine and then let's.

1212
02:32:48,889 --> 02:32:55,099
I didn't want this to die. That's incorrect number.

1213
02:32:56,649 --> 02:33:05,129
Oh, I didn't hear. Okay.

1214
02:33:05,279 --> 02:33:15,389
So that is 3.03. So this is a g adjusted geometric mean of another Latin lover in this population.

1215
02:33:17,889 --> 02:33:21,159
Everyone get it? Good.

1216
02:33:21,819 --> 02:33:26,799
Okay. All right. So the rest of them is.

1217
02:33:26,979 --> 02:33:38,049
That's why after you run this module and then line 91 through 95 is just using the again, manually putting this number.

1218
02:33:39,829 --> 02:33:49,669
And then homo. Even though I'm not grading homo years, try to calculate why one using this bracket system.

1219
02:33:50,689 --> 02:33:55,369
Instead of using this manually entering number using the bracket system.

1220
02:33:55,549 --> 02:33:59,989
Recalculate this y and then calculate.

1221
02:34:01,459 --> 02:34:06,229
Adjusted adjusted local level cover.

1222
02:34:07,399 --> 02:34:16,999
By using this, you are. One thing you have to make sure is this reader is because alchemy is a transformed the value of earth.

1223
02:34:18,169 --> 02:34:21,289
You should have that explanation yet. Okay.

1224
02:34:21,679 --> 02:34:27,739
First step is you are calculating this vector of adjusted local at the number.

1225
02:34:30,609 --> 02:34:35,199
And then later your calculator.

1226
02:34:35,829 --> 02:34:39,459
So previously, as we did before to apply.

1227
02:34:41,669 --> 02:34:48,479
So we want okay. We want you to calculate mean or lovable other leather lover by education lover.

1228
02:34:50,519 --> 02:34:54,269
And that after we do this and that explanation.

1229
02:34:54,539 --> 02:34:58,169
So this is geometric mean. Okay.

1230
02:34:59,809 --> 02:35:02,389
Follow me. Okay.

1231
02:35:04,639 --> 02:35:14,119
And then age adjusted years after you are creating that new value over and then putting this new value over and again because this is.

1232
02:35:15,549 --> 02:35:20,109
Low blood age adjusted, low blood level ever.

1233
02:35:20,169 --> 02:35:29,409
So that's why after you are calculating mean or lower below the level of her geometric mean years explanation that.

1234
02:35:31,179 --> 02:35:35,199
Okay. All right.

1235
02:35:35,589 --> 02:35:39,399
Let me stop here for a minute earlier. Okay.

1236
02:35:40,299 --> 02:35:49,929
Well, any crystal clear, you know, so far to which I will post after the class is doing this exercise.

1237
02:35:50,559 --> 02:35:51,184
Okay. So after you've finished hormone one, you will be on x four.
