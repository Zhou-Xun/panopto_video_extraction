00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:09,481
Hello, my name is Paul Fleming, I'm an
assistant professor of health behavior and

2
00:00:09,481 --> 00:00:11,847
health education at
the School of Public Health.

3
00:00:11,847 --> 00:00:15,187
This video focuses on
engaging stakeholders and

4
00:00:15,187 --> 00:00:19,182
community members within
the program planning process.

5
00:00:19,182 --> 00:00:22,420
So first off, what is a stakeholder?

6
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:28,180
The CDC defines a stakeholder as people or
organizations invested in the program,

7
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:30,940
interested in the results
of the evaluation or

8
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:34,720
with a stake in what's going to be done
with the results of the evaluation.

9
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:40,300
Representing their needs and interests
throughout the process is fundamental.

10
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,260
How about, what is a community?

11
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:46,607
The CDC talks about a community as
groups of people who are affiliated by

12
00:00:46,607 --> 00:00:49,362
geographic proximity, special interest,

13
00:00:49,362 --> 00:00:55,191
or similar situations with respect to
issues affecting their well-being.

14
00:00:55,191 --> 00:01:01,020
So why engage stakeholders and community
members in the program planning process?

15
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,937
There are many, many reasons but

16
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:06,232
I like to think of five principle
reasons that we do this.

17
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:10,814
The first one is ethical reasons, so
it's very important that communities

18
00:01:10,814 --> 00:01:15,182
should have the power to decide what
happens in their own communities and

19
00:01:15,182 --> 00:01:17,701
what health issues are being addressed.

20
00:01:17,701 --> 00:01:21,098
And it's important that we as
public health professionals are not

21
00:01:21,098 --> 00:01:25,780
imposing programs on
communities without their say.

22
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:28,964
The second major reason is compatibility,
so

23
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:34,880
compatibility helps better match
program goals with the community needs.

24
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,530
So by involving stakeholders and

25
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:41,470
community members we're able to
make that match even better.

26
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:45,110
The third one is that it improves
the success of a program.

27
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:49,191
So if we're involving community
members and stakeholders and

28
00:01:49,191 --> 00:01:54,119
they're having a voice in what the program
looks like and how we're going to

29
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:58,597
address the program, that program
is more likely to be successful.

30
00:01:58,597 --> 00:02:03,432
The fourth one is sustainability, so we
can increase the likelihood of sustaining

31
00:02:03,432 --> 00:02:07,232
a program overtime if we're
involving the community members and

32
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:09,801
key stakeholders throughout the process.

33
00:02:09,801 --> 00:02:14,119
Lots of programs have a limited amount of
funding and once that funding ends, you

34
00:02:14,119 --> 00:02:18,930
need the investment of community members
and stakeholders to keep that going.

35
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,510
So by involving them from the start,

36
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:25,160
it increases the likelihood
of sustaining the program.

37
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:30,920
And the fifth reason is that it engages
in a process of mutual capacity building.

38
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:35,460
So the community members,
by being involved in the process,

39
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:39,630
learn more about public health,
planning a public health program and

40
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:42,260
executing a public health program.

41
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:46,509
Additionally, public health professionals
also learn from community members about

42
00:02:46,509 --> 00:02:50,289
the community members' needs,
what aspects would be most successful, and

43
00:02:50,289 --> 00:02:56,187
how to deliver a program within
that particular community.

44
00:02:56,187 --> 00:03:01,112
So to engage stakeholders we need to first
identify them, so one key question to

45
00:03:01,112 --> 00:03:06,125
identify stakeholders is, what group or
community does this program focus on?

46
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:09,874
So you wanna be thinking about,
who are the community members,

47
00:03:09,874 --> 00:03:12,797
maybe it's a patients group or
group of clients?

48
00:03:12,797 --> 00:03:16,734
Who are the advocacy group that
are working in the same area?

49
00:03:16,734 --> 00:03:20,056
And then with the community you
are working with, who are the leaders?

50
00:03:20,056 --> 00:03:22,510
What's the leadership structure
within that community?

51
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:26,448
Those are all some stakeholders that
you’ll want to engage throughout

52
00:03:26,448 --> 00:03:27,242
the process.

53
00:03:27,242 --> 00:03:31,054
You also might ask, who is going to
be involved in program operations?

54
00:03:31,054 --> 00:03:34,304
So this will include staff that
are working on the program,

55
00:03:34,304 --> 00:03:36,970
management team that’s
managing the program,

56
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:40,613
funders that are providing financial
resources for the program,

57
00:03:40,613 --> 00:03:46,370
as well as partner agencies that may be
working with you to implement the program.

58
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:50,157
Another question you might ask to
identify stakeholders is, who funds and

59
00:03:50,157 --> 00:03:51,792
has oversight for the program?

60
00:03:51,792 --> 00:03:56,552
So, again, the funders will come
into play, this may be a foundation,

61
00:03:56,552 --> 00:04:01,018
a county government, city government,
the federal government.

62
00:04:01,018 --> 00:04:03,930
And along those lines,
you wanna involve elected official or

63
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:08,120
government leaders who do have
an oversight role for the program.

64
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,740
When you're involving stakeholders and

65
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:13,460
community members you wanna think
about several key questions.

66
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,240
These aren't the only
questions you might ask,

67
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,930
but here's some to give you an example.

68
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:21,090
Does this program focus
on the right issues?

69
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:24,130
How is this program important to you?

70
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:27,359
What do you want this
program to accomplish?

71
00:04:27,359 --> 00:04:30,827
How would you define
success of this program?

72
00:04:30,827 --> 00:04:33,704
How should this program be implemented,

73
00:04:33,704 --> 00:04:38,727
how should we recruit participants,
and how should data be collected?

74
00:04:38,727 --> 00:04:42,511
What kinds of resources are you
willing to contribute to this program,

75
00:04:42,511 --> 00:04:46,880
including things like time,
funding, or expertise?

76
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:51,560
So we can think about engaging community
members and stakeholders as a spectrum.

77
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:56,690
So in any given public health project or
public health program, there's a spectrum

78
00:04:56,690 --> 00:05:01,330
of how much engagement you'll have
with a community or with stakeholders.

79
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:07,437
The NIH and the CDC have developed a
spectrum of five categories of engagement.

80
00:05:07,437 --> 00:05:12,309
It starts on the left side with outreach
and then moves to consulting the community

81
00:05:12,309 --> 00:05:16,969
or stakeholders, involving them,
collaborating with them, and finally,

82
00:05:16,969 --> 00:05:22,145
on the right hand side, shared leadership
with community members and stakeholders.

83
00:05:22,145 --> 00:05:25,750
So if we look at across this spectrum,
on the left hand side,

84
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:30,630
outreach is really the minimal
amount of involving the community.

85
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:35,210
It primarily involves communication flows
from the public health professionals

86
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:39,890
to the community, simply to inform
them about what the program is and

87
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:42,200
how it'll be conducted.

88
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,590
So they're providing the community
with some information.

89
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:47,160
Moving along the spectrum,

90
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:51,080
consulting the community involves
slightly more community involvement.

91
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:56,080
Communication flows to the community but
then also the community is providing some

92
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,580
input back to the public
health professionals.

93
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:04,980
Involving the community is again
slightly more community involvement and

94
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,940
communication flows both ways.

95
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:11,660
And this is participatory communication so
the community members and stakeholders

96
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:16,460
feel that they are able to communicate
with the planners and vise versa.

97
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:21,750
Moving to collaborate the community
involvement is increased, in that case

98
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:26,960
the community members and the program
planners are really forming a partnership

99
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,640
and they're helping to develop what
the program is going to look like.

100
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,810
Finally all the way at right
head hand is share leadership.

101
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:37,808
This is a strong bidirectional
relationship and

102
00:06:37,808 --> 00:06:41,619
final decision making is done
really at the community level.

103
00:06:41,619 --> 00:06:46,118
So the community has most of the say
in the decisions that are getting made

104
00:06:46,118 --> 00:06:50,322
about what the program will focus on,
how it'll be conducted, and

105
00:06:50,322 --> 00:06:52,124
how it'll be implemented.

106
00:06:52,124 --> 00:06:54,935
It's not always possible to
have shared leadership and

107
00:06:54,935 --> 00:06:58,120
to be all the way on the right
side of the spectrum.

108
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,900
But as public health professionals, we
should be seeking to involve communities

109
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:06,970
and stakeholders as much as possible
in the program planning process.

110
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:10,500
The CDC has developed nine
principles of community engagement

111
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:14,650
that we should keep in mind any time we're
working on a public health program and

112
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:17,800
planning on engaging community members.

113
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:22,370
The first two really should be done before
you start to engage community members.

114
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:25,110
So first,
we should be clear about the purpose or

115
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:29,060
goals of why we're engaging
community members.

116
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:32,960
Second, we need to become
knowledgeable about the community,

117
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,390
this means that we need to learn its
history, culture, economic conditions,

118
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:41,680
political and power structures,
what are its norms and values.

119
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,570
And also what's its history or experience

120
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:49,600
with efforts by outside groups to engage
it in prior public health programs.

121
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,800
All of this is about doing your research
before you try to engage community

122
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,840
members.

123
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,780
The third principle of community
engagement, is you'll actually go out

124
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:00,260
to the community,
establish relationships, and build trust.

125
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:04,330
This involves working with formal and
informal leadership.

126
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:07,340
The most important piece of this is
that you're actually spending time

127
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,300
with community members.

128
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:12,140
The fourth principle of community
engagement is that we remember and

129
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:15,620
accept that collective self-determination
is the responsibility and

130
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,410
right of all people in a community.

131
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:21,540
This really means that we need to be
giving community members a say and

132
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:24,860
a voice in what happens
in their community.

133
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:28,310
Us as public health professionals
shouldn't assume we can bestow this on

134
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:30,130
the community,

135
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:33,570
the community should have the power
to act in its own self interests.

136
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:37,850
The fifth principle is that partnering
with the community is necessary to create

137
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,430
change and improve health.

138
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:43,530
So when our goal as public health
professionals is to improve a community's

139
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:45,690
health or health outcomes,

140
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:50,470
we know that partnering with a community
is the best way to achieve those goals.

141
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:54,850
The sixth principle is that all aspects of
community engagement must recognize and

142
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:57,000
respect the diversity of the community.

143
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,470
Within any given community there
are different types of people,

144
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:04,580
different constituencies, and as public
health professionals we need to ensure

145
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:09,050
that our engagement efforts involve
each of those constituencies.

146
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:12,679
The seventh principle of community
engagement is that it can only be

147
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:16,765
sustained by identifying and
mobilizing community assets and strengths.

148
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:20,715
We also need to be building
the community's capacity and

149
00:09:20,715 --> 00:09:23,932
resources to make decisions and
take action.

150
00:09:23,932 --> 00:09:27,842
The eighth principle of community
engagement is that program planners must

151
00:09:27,842 --> 00:09:32,058
be prepared to release control of actions,
or interventions to the community and

152
00:09:32,058 --> 00:09:35,710
be flexible enough to
meet its changing needs.

153
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:40,110
And finally community collaboration
requires long-term commitment by

154
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:43,200
the program planners and
public health professionals.

155
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,480
This means that before we
initiate any engagement effort,

156
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,870
we need to know that we're invested for
the long term.

157
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:53,580
To conclude,
partnering with stakeholders and

158
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:56,920
community members is essential
to public health programs.

159
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,190
That are ethical engaging, and

160
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:02,902
ultimately successful at making
the public health change that we seek.
