1
00:00:04,416 --> 00:00:10,296
An associate professor of human genetics and the associate director of the Population Genetics at the Institute of Precision

2
00:00:10,296 --> 00:00:20,226
Health Center in Los Angeles speak with us today on computational methods for genomic studies of mixed populations.

3
00:00:22,006 --> 00:00:31,256
Great. Thank you so much. So much, and you guys hear me all the way in the back so I don't have to.

4
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:35,136
All right. Thank you so much for the invitation. I'm really excited to be here in person.

5
00:00:35,496 --> 00:00:44,645
I know that I give a talk here virtually during the zoom time and I make sure that this topic does not overlap that much with that topic.

6
00:00:44,646 --> 00:00:52,356
So by way of introduction, this is the group that essentially has done most of the work with trainees,

7
00:00:52,356 --> 00:01:00,516
and I'm going to be presenting the results today. And for the past five, ten years, my group has been focusing mainly on three main areas.

8
00:01:01,296 --> 00:01:05,585
One is genomic risk prediction that deals with all different course uncertainty.

9
00:01:05,586 --> 00:01:09,606
And this is the topic that I covered during the pandemic.

10
00:01:09,726 --> 00:01:17,045
When I give you guys, hopefully some of you listen to the other focus area of my group has been on methods

11
00:01:17,046 --> 00:01:21,516
for underrepresented populations and I'll talk more about it today about this.

12
00:01:21,966 --> 00:01:28,266
And who knows, maybe if I'll come back in the future, I'll talk about the third and a third things there,

13
00:01:28,506 --> 00:01:32,376
which is all about, you know, methods for functional genomics,

14
00:01:32,376 --> 00:01:36,246
such as transcript, wide association studies and fly mapping is is important,

15
00:01:36,516 --> 00:01:40,925
which I know that there you know you guys have amazing expertise in that area.

16
00:01:40,926 --> 00:01:44,406
It was really exciting to talk to you. All right.

17
00:01:44,556 --> 00:01:50,616
So without further ado, I'm going to spend some time introducing a mixed populations.

18
00:01:51,036 --> 00:01:57,086
And this is an area that it's a list that has a lot of conceptions and misperceptions.

19
00:01:57,106 --> 00:02:03,336
I'm going to have those lower in terms of deliberate in introducing the concept and I'm going to be using today.

20
00:02:03,756 --> 00:02:09,906
And I'm really curious how you guys see this, and I'm really curious to hear your feedback about all of the things that you're doing.

21
00:02:10,566 --> 00:02:18,396
Then I'm going to dive into statistical methodologies that we and others have been developing to do, but it's called disease mapping.

22
00:02:18,606 --> 00:02:25,986
So this will be association mapping all the way to trying to understand how genetic risk gets propagated in the mixed populations.

23
00:02:26,926 --> 00:02:36,036
And then finally, with a very interesting topic that's kind of like we started this year and we're very, very excited and fascinating about this,

24
00:02:36,396 --> 00:02:39,126
this fundamental question that we're all grapple with,

25
00:02:39,486 --> 00:02:46,176
which is whether the genetics plays the same role of disease across different ancestry populations.

26
00:02:46,176 --> 00:02:53,706
And I'm going to try to argue that you're looking at a mixed individuals or the mixed populations is a unique way where we could,

27
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:56,586
you know, answer this question. And finally,

28
00:02:56,586 --> 00:03:05,526
I'm going to show you a little bit of the results of how we're kind of operationalizing all this methodologies within our Biobank at UCLA,

29
00:03:05,526 --> 00:03:14,435
which is called Atlas, and try to convince you that we should move away from clustering clustering individuals into units of ancestry.

30
00:03:14,436 --> 00:03:18,696
And just we should start thinking about, you know, a continuum of genetic ancestry.

31
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:24,306
And again, this is a buzzword continuum that I'll try to convince you that it's actually something that we can compute.

32
00:03:24,306 --> 00:03:27,716
And that's something interesting to. All right.

33
00:03:27,726 --> 00:03:37,086
So when you think about that mixture, generally, we started thinking about admixture between different continental ancestry sources.

34
00:03:37,386 --> 00:03:39,726
So we typically think about African-Americans.

35
00:03:39,726 --> 00:03:47,616
We think about Hispanic, Latino Americans, which are a result of the transatlantic slave trade, other forms of democracies or migrations.

36
00:03:48,066 --> 00:03:52,376
But in general, that mixture occurs that all sorts of different types of foods,

37
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:59,646
all the way from Neanderthals introversion into the ancestors of currently Europeans and Asians all the way.

38
00:03:59,676 --> 00:04:07,746
So currently, you know, a mixture or a mixture of different genetic ancestries within, you know, virtually every city worldwide.

39
00:04:07,776 --> 00:04:14,826
Well, people come from having ancestry from various different genetic genetic sources.

40
00:04:15,486 --> 00:04:24,936
And really what we are starting to emerge to see in the biobanks is that mixture between different subcontinental ancestry is a bit of this,

41
00:04:24,936 --> 00:04:31,566
and virtually everyone that we're looking at is somehow some degree of genetically evidence.

42
00:04:32,046 --> 00:04:37,776
And we've gotten to the point where the papers, the perspective papers, all they're one from most results in colleagues,

43
00:04:38,196 --> 00:04:43,326
noting that what we thought about homogeneity in the genetic ancestry within populations.

44
00:04:43,566 --> 00:04:51,626
It's an idealized concept that doesn't really exist and unpacked this a little bit before I got into further.

45
00:04:51,636 --> 00:04:54,995
I want to make the point that when we think about genetic ancestry,

46
00:04:54,996 --> 00:05:02,556
that's a distinct concept from the self-reported socioeconomic for social determinants of race and ethnicity.

47
00:05:03,006 --> 00:05:07,896
There are many different papers that have been reported this, and here I'm just highlighting just one of them.

48
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:17,166
You know, a couple of years ago, that really makes the point that what people self-identify as distinct from that history of one's genome.

49
00:05:17,826 --> 00:05:24,636
And there's no other populations to exemplify this than a mixed individual where

50
00:05:24,876 --> 00:05:29,406
genetically genetic ancestry varies across the genome and various individuals.

51
00:05:31,386 --> 00:05:36,005
The other big punch line here, which is I'm sure all of us are fully aware of this,

52
00:05:36,006 --> 00:05:42,726
is that such individuals that have, you know, mixed ancestry are vastly underrepresented in genomics.

53
00:05:43,566 --> 00:05:53,046
Here's one of this log where on the x axis you see years ago going all the way back to 2000 and the wide scale,

54
00:05:53,056 --> 00:05:58,986
you see the percentage of individuals in genomic studies that are essentially from various ancestry populations.

55
00:05:59,496 --> 00:06:02,796
And as we move forward, we get more diverse ancestries.

56
00:06:03,036 --> 00:06:08,256
It remains the case that individuals or by mixed ancestry continue to be underrepresented,

57
00:06:08,676 --> 00:06:19,746
partly because there's such a misconception that the statistics or we don't have the methodologies to analyze them correct for ancestry properly.

58
00:06:20,106 --> 00:06:25,716
And if if there's one take of message that I have with you today, is that that's wrong.

59
00:06:25,746 --> 00:06:35,376
We do have quite a sophisticated statistical tool set to analyze data from from the following admixture individuals.

60
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:43,236
And just just like on trivia, roughly one third or one in three people within the U.S.

61
00:06:43,746 --> 00:06:46,896
Self-report as having mixed or mixed ancestry.

62
00:06:47,256 --> 00:06:51,966
Whereas in the genomics studies, it's roughly, you know, but it's like one in 20.

63
00:06:51,996 --> 00:07:00,426
So you see like this massive underrepresentation. And according to the U.S. Census, that number is going to go to around 50% within by 2050.

64
00:07:00,546 --> 00:07:08,166
So for all of you that are more on the junior side within your career, you'll have, you know, working with mixed populations.

65
00:07:08,436 --> 00:07:13,086
Roughly one in two individuals will be impacted by your research.

66
00:07:14,256 --> 00:07:24,156
Okay. So in order to kind of like dissect and unpack some of the methodologies here, let me go into how we traditionally model that mix pockets.

67
00:07:24,696 --> 00:07:29,886
So that's in the most simplistic form would think about it as two ancestrally diverged populations,

68
00:07:29,886 --> 00:07:34,535
let's say the red and the blue population there that have been diverged for a while.

69
00:07:34,536 --> 00:07:41,616
And then, you know, people from from those ancestry come and have offspring in a different environment and a different population.

70
00:07:42,096 --> 00:07:51,156
And due to recombination events, the genome of the mixed individuals starts recombining between segments from the different ancestral sources,

71
00:07:51,456 --> 00:07:59,196
such that the the genome that makes individuals have this unique features that they're a mosaic of segments of ancestry from.

72
00:07:59,526 --> 00:08:05,826
In this case, the red and the blue population and the length and the distribution of this ancestry segment is

73
00:08:05,876 --> 00:08:12,606
another molecular part that we can use to investigate the properties of this demographic about.

74
00:08:13,596 --> 00:08:22,596
But I'm not going to be talking about that today. I'm talking about how do we use that in, you know, genetic study with genetics of disease.

75
00:08:24,576 --> 00:08:31,186
So that type of. Genetic segments of different ancestral sources.

76
00:08:31,516 --> 00:08:38,356
It uses the unique feature for the mix individuals, where every individual has its own unique mosaic of ancestry,

77
00:08:38,506 --> 00:08:42,836
which leads to unique proportions in genome wide ancestry.

78
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:48,726
So the proportion of how much of that one's genome comes from the red or the blue population in that case.

79
00:08:49,186 --> 00:08:57,616
And here on the left side, as you're looking, you see the standard way that people plot genetic data using principal component analysis,

80
00:08:57,916 --> 00:09:03,376
where individuals with mixed ancestry form a line from their ancestral sources.

81
00:09:03,706 --> 00:09:09,516
Here on the bottom here to see individuals outside of the world as African American forming a line from this,

82
00:09:09,926 --> 00:09:19,636
an African genetic ancestry cluster towards a European genetic basis cluster, the same type of thing or variation across individuals.

83
00:09:19,636 --> 00:09:24,676
You can see it on the right side. The various populations within Central and South America,

84
00:09:24,976 --> 00:09:33,126
where you do see every individual have it has its own unique proportion of African Europeans or Native Americans.

85
00:09:33,496 --> 00:09:36,886
So every unique is personalized, if you will, based on this proportion.

86
00:09:38,476 --> 00:09:46,515
The fact that the segments of ancestry come on different or the common different ancestry

87
00:09:46,516 --> 00:09:52,666
segment allows us to think about how do we consider disease mapping in mixed populations.

88
00:09:53,116 --> 00:09:56,775
So the first one is we need to correct all these for genome wide ancestry

89
00:09:56,776 --> 00:10:01,816
because genome more ancestry is correlated with social determinants of health.

90
00:10:02,116 --> 00:10:09,616
So by correcting for it, we can remove that potential bias from from our studies and really did that.

91
00:10:10,066 --> 00:10:14,206
The most interesting point here is that every allele,

92
00:10:14,206 --> 00:10:18,046
every potential causal issue appears of multiple backgrounds in populations

93
00:10:18,056 --> 00:10:23,446
of an to here I'm showing you an example of an individual that it's a mixed

94
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:27,915
European African and we see an animal that's potentially causal having an effect

95
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:35,626
size on the African background or rather economic round here or or relevance.

96
00:10:36,346 --> 00:10:41,895
Okay. So the fact that these values appear on different backgrounds allows us to ask

97
00:10:41,896 --> 00:10:47,376
questions whether these effects by ancestry are distinct or not in these populations.

98
00:10:48,796 --> 00:10:55,546
So in the next three slides, I'll try to disentangle one of the concepts that it's often misunderstood in this area,

99
00:10:56,086 --> 00:10:59,206
and that's the concept of heterogeneity by ancestry.

100
00:10:59,476 --> 00:11:05,376
So how do we measure this distinction? How do we measure differences in the genetic effects across ancestry?

101
00:11:05,896 --> 00:11:17,086
The first one is the simplest one, the causal. You could have different impacts on disease as as if it comes on, let's say, red or blue ancestry.

102
00:11:17,446 --> 00:11:23,646
So the effect size could be different because interactions exist divided by and so on and so forth, right?

103
00:11:23,896 --> 00:11:27,066
So that's the simplest way to think about heterogeneity by ancestry.

104
00:11:27,976 --> 00:11:36,136
The other one is even when the causal effects are the same, even when biology is all the same in every cell in the body,

105
00:11:37,606 --> 00:11:42,076
it could still be the case that these mutations have different frequencies in the two populations.

106
00:11:42,616 --> 00:11:50,085
So the fact that the frequency of this causal you has a very poor population induces a difference

107
00:11:50,086 --> 00:11:54,586
in the variance explained by these mutations in the disease status across populations,

108
00:11:54,916 --> 00:12:00,346
which is usually leads to a mixture signal and I'll get back to it in a few slide.

109
00:12:00,646 --> 00:12:08,046
But that's also been referred to as heterogeneity by ancestry because now you can explain different proportions of the variants and the disease,

110
00:12:08,056 --> 00:12:12,886
even though biological the same and the B of the Middle East have the exact same effect by France.

111
00:12:14,236 --> 00:12:19,306
And finally, which kind of encompasses a lot of the challenges here,

112
00:12:19,786 --> 00:12:25,245
we often don't know the causal and we're looking at something that it's tagging the causal and

113
00:12:25,246 --> 00:12:33,166
therefore we have this tag ability issue and target tagging variants or it's ancestry specific.

114
00:12:33,526 --> 00:12:39,916
So every potential causal animal, it's tagged differentially, whether it's on, let's say European versus African, I come back.

115
00:12:40,486 --> 00:12:45,916
So every time we think about heterogeneity, we need to think about at least these three sources and which I want to focus on the fact a little.

116
00:12:47,776 --> 00:12:54,556
So how do we kind of combine these into a statistical model to do disease mapping and say in mixed populations, well,

117
00:12:54,556 --> 00:13:00,915
the standard way to do it is, you know what, it's been infectious genome wide association studies, which I'm sure all of you are familiar with.

118
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:06,196
So I'm not going to dive too much into it, but essentially I'm going to present it in the case control setting.

119
00:13:06,196 --> 00:13:13,665
But you can think about continuous as well. What do you is looking for is looking for associations or a difference in the frequencies of a

120
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:18,796
particular particular potential cases versus controls people that haven't gone after the disease,

121
00:13:19,276 --> 00:13:26,686
which is rather straightforwardly modeled by the likely ratio test where we're simply testing for an effect.

122
00:13:26,756 --> 00:13:32,816
Size of a particular mutation or a particular variant in the causal versus the normal.

123
00:13:33,176 --> 00:13:40,976
So I put it here as that like the original test, but obviously in practice in all sorts of different ways to do this associations.

124
00:13:41,576 --> 00:13:47,846
And as I said before, it's critical for any information to model it as or always correct for the genome what has.

125
00:13:49,566 --> 00:13:52,986
Because I think populations have low levels, not a pure multiple backgrounds.

126
00:13:53,226 --> 00:13:59,735
We can actually disentangle this and we can ask whether we or we can write a model

127
00:13:59,736 --> 00:14:03,666
in which the effect sizes are decoupled based on this local ancestry background.

128
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:10,596
So we can it's equivalent a meta analysis for those that are more interested in that area where

129
00:14:10,896 --> 00:14:16,656
we ask whether the effect size in the European background and in fact size on the African

130
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:22,836
background are a helpful and we assign them the same causal link and this allows us to run

131
00:14:23,286 --> 00:14:29,526
associations and that is treating this to effect sizes in different components of the link.

132
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:35,196
And because I'm here, I'm assuming a set of the same odds ratio or the same effect size,

133
00:14:35,556 --> 00:14:42,516
then it's still a 1 to 1 degree of freedom test that it's equivalent to running this test,

134
00:14:42,636 --> 00:14:47,706
you know, it's an average of them and then analyzing under a fixed effect assumption.

135
00:14:49,206 --> 00:14:52,886
So because we can do that, then we can already start modeling differentially.

136
00:14:53,316 --> 00:14:57,606
So we can, if we believe that the effect size might vary, but that's just the start.

137
00:14:57,606 --> 00:15:04,866
Modeling them as a effect size being on a couple European versus African on the two local ancestor background.

138
00:15:05,466 --> 00:15:10,865
And, you know, we can allow them to vary as we want and that will keep us to a degree of know testing or we can,

139
00:15:10,866 --> 00:15:17,776
you know, make them similar or similar. And that will allow us to play the game between one degree total freedom plus.

140
00:15:18,186 --> 00:15:26,676
And as you might expect, that will give us a tradeoff between power versus the local ancestry signal.

141
00:15:26,706 --> 00:15:35,496
You can think about it as if the disease causing the level is higher frequency in one of the ancestries.

142
00:15:35,616 --> 00:15:42,756
In this case, let's say the red ancestry that individuals that carry the disease will have more of those alleles and the disease causing locus,

143
00:15:43,296 --> 00:15:47,705
and that induces what it's called an admixture signal or a correlation between the

144
00:15:47,706 --> 00:15:51,966
average looking ancestry in the cases versus either genome wide or versus control,

145
00:15:52,086 --> 00:15:53,376
depending on the onset of.

146
00:15:53,976 --> 00:16:00,996
And for those of you that originated in the field, this was actually one of the first ways to do, you know, disease mapping even before gwas.

147
00:16:01,266 --> 00:16:05,826
So it's kind of interesting that now we're in some ways we're getting back to it and trying to merge it.

148
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:12,706
Exactly follow the same kind of paradigm where we can write a likely ratio test where we

149
00:16:12,706 --> 00:16:17,565
have under the now the there's no effect for the local ancestry under the alternate,

150
00:16:17,566 --> 00:16:19,336
there's an effect for the local ancestry.

151
00:16:19,546 --> 00:16:28,276
And we can write again a one degrees of freedom test that would be essentially equivalent to running a regression between,

152
00:16:28,936 --> 00:16:31,966
you know, time and the local ancestry status.

153
00:16:31,966 --> 00:16:41,686
And in this case, because we uncouple these now, we can start doing something more exciting or more and more or more fun if we can,

154
00:16:41,866 --> 00:16:46,996
because we uncouple the local ancestry in the first step in the case control study,

155
00:16:47,326 --> 00:16:52,966
we can essentially add these two likelihoods together or multiply them or add the look likelihoods.

156
00:16:53,296 --> 00:16:55,366
And we can mathematically show that these are independent.

157
00:16:55,696 --> 00:17:01,996
And this is this would be a way where we can sum the effect of the association with the effect of the admixture.

158
00:17:02,656 --> 00:17:06,586
And, you know, we paid the penalty off to the degree of final test.

159
00:17:06,976 --> 00:17:14,565
But again, now we're essentially gaining more insights into into how do we do admixture or association spouses.

160
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:15,526
And that makes a difference.

161
00:17:16,996 --> 00:17:24,856
The really interesting bit that that you just of like writing down with the math there is that you can actually under some very simple assumptions,

162
00:17:25,126 --> 00:17:31,606
you can write down the induced effect on the local ancestry if you know the effect size of the causal genes.

163
00:17:32,026 --> 00:17:35,536
And you know what some very straightforward manipulations can show,

164
00:17:35,536 --> 00:17:45,346
that the ancestry effect is a function of the allele effects of the causal, and the gene has this very nice and simple formula there.

165
00:17:45,796 --> 00:17:54,346
And you can clearly see that if the snip is not causal or is equal to one there, that the the ancestry effect size will be essentially one.

166
00:17:55,366 --> 00:18:02,926
Or if you see that the earlier frequencies are the same in two of the two ancestries, again it can cancel out irrespective of the causal.

167
00:18:03,586 --> 00:18:08,206
So this gives you insights of when should you expect a little bit ancestry studies.

168
00:18:08,656 --> 00:18:12,616
It's either you need both effect size as well as differentiating the frequencies.

169
00:18:13,756 --> 00:18:14,806
Okay. So I'll show you.

170
00:18:15,076 --> 00:18:20,446
I showed you a bunch of, like, squares, and, you know, there's a map behind it, which I can show you, but we can talk about it.

171
00:18:20,776 --> 00:18:24,076
How does it look? How do all these tests operate in practice?

172
00:18:24,616 --> 00:18:28,345
And here are a bunch of simulations based on advanced individuals in the UK.

173
00:18:28,346 --> 00:18:31,816
Five. So these are individuals, Africans and Europeans.

174
00:18:32,656 --> 00:18:36,256
The simulations are called simulations under some reasonable effect size,

175
00:18:36,396 --> 00:18:45,316
which is but the the the the poorer simulations are distinguish them between.

176
00:18:45,646 --> 00:18:49,186
On the left side is what happens at a randomly picked variant of the genome.

177
00:18:49,696 --> 00:18:55,036
And on the right side, what happens it varies that happens to have different audio frequencies between the two.

178
00:18:55,036 --> 00:19:02,176
But with the idea that those with a little frequency difference are some are more biologically interesting to look at.

179
00:19:02,836 --> 00:19:07,756
So with the methods that are comparing, here are just a flavor of the ones that I showed you before.

180
00:19:07,966 --> 00:19:11,556
The top one is just the vanilla juice with a correction for genome one ancestry.

181
00:19:11,806 --> 00:19:15,946
One is the one where you partition it by looking at the street.

182
00:19:16,356 --> 00:19:26,056
It's just combining them tractors. A recently proposed approach that allows for a lot of heterogeneity defined by ancestry by Elizabeth.

183
00:19:26,296 --> 00:19:29,806
So now and again, pull test, correct, for for genomic tests.

184
00:19:30,856 --> 00:19:34,726
So here's the the most powerful thing that you can see in this series.

185
00:19:35,296 --> 00:19:41,566
If you just compare, you know, these methods that do not adjust for looking at them just for local ancestry,

186
00:19:42,106 --> 00:19:50,026
you can already see that in fact, per unit of individual sample size at the same sample size of you us,

187
00:19:50,476 --> 00:19:56,235
you get more power by looking at mixed populations than by looking at homogeneous population because you

188
00:19:56,236 --> 00:20:01,126
get more signal between the differentiation because on the average every snap is slightly differentiated.

189
00:20:01,786 --> 00:20:08,086
So per unit, per individual that you are told you are you're more powerful to detect disease causing associations.

190
00:20:08,476 --> 00:20:14,906
You know, it makes populations. The other part is, as you might expect, if you condition all the affected local ancestry,

191
00:20:15,206 --> 00:20:20,186
you're actually removing some of the effects and then you might lose some of the,

192
00:20:20,456 --> 00:20:26,096
you know, a little bit about positives that you might be able to adjust for different heterogeneity by ancestry.

193
00:20:26,936 --> 00:20:34,556
And finally, if you're really going for, you know, lots of differences by ancestry, you reduce far by around 10% or so.

194
00:20:34,826 --> 00:20:39,356
But you're gaining in robustness because some regions might truly have heterogeneity.

195
00:20:41,576 --> 00:20:44,786
Those are some regions. Here's what happened in real results.

196
00:20:45,086 --> 00:20:54,086
Essentially, you get slightly 10% less power by methods that account for heterogeneity across the board.

197
00:20:54,476 --> 00:21:00,266
And this is fully expected because you need to pay a penalty by because of the extra degree of freedom.

198
00:21:02,066 --> 00:21:10,976
But really, one would be if you focus on just loci where you see a large frequency differentiation and this is the case for this.

199
00:21:11,406 --> 00:21:16,196
Duffy Smoot, which happens to be one of the highest differentiated snippets in Europeans and Africans.

200
00:21:17,246 --> 00:21:20,376
You see this method that correct for looking at three completely missing.

201
00:21:21,356 --> 00:21:28,886
And this is a well known causing a Lille that causes a condition that it's been labeled by clinician as benign ethnic neutropenia,

202
00:21:29,336 --> 00:21:32,266
which in non-medical terms means that, you know,

203
00:21:32,486 --> 00:21:36,956
the neutrophil counts as one standard deviation lower than the expectation, but it doesn't cause anything.

204
00:21:37,466 --> 00:21:41,245
So that's why it's too benign. So, you know, clinicians know that, that that's what's happening.

205
00:21:41,246 --> 00:21:47,816
This mutation causes this. And you see that my condition look honestly, completely missed all the single bit, which is what you would expect.

206
00:21:48,266 --> 00:21:54,326
Simply because local antigen tags perfectly the the the association thing.

207
00:21:55,626 --> 00:22:03,626
Okay so if I come visit them, we have a lot of statistical methods to, you know, mapping in that mixed populations as many more.

208
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:13,216
I'm happy to talk more about you, but the the really the fundamental question here that you might have is how do we select among these methods?

209
00:22:13,226 --> 00:22:22,076
What is our guiding principle? And what's fundamental there is whether we believe that the causal effects are the same or not across ancestry.

210
00:22:22,676 --> 00:22:30,476
And I, I posed this as you know, this is probably fundamental, not just for mixed individuals, but also as we think about,

211
00:22:30,476 --> 00:22:35,336
you know, transferring genetic finding from, let's say, Europeans to Asians to worldwide population.

212
00:22:36,956 --> 00:22:46,796
And the unique features of different segments of global ancestry allows us or at least individuals to actually ask this question in a very,

213
00:22:46,796 --> 00:22:54,826
very controlled environment. So within a given cell, you know, all the cellular context is all the same for a particular individual, right?

214
00:22:55,166 --> 00:23:01,586
So we can study the effect of this the on disease with we without confounders from the environment.

215
00:23:03,026 --> 00:23:10,345
And, you know, we wanted to utilize this unique feature of, you know, individuals ancestries to try to tackle this question.

216
00:23:10,346 --> 00:23:13,766
Are the effects on European backgrounds the same thing as in on Africans?

217
00:23:15,176 --> 00:23:25,256
And because we've found out for the past ten, 15 years that all the human diseases have lots and lots of other variants or risk associated regions.

218
00:23:25,676 --> 00:23:31,286
We shifted this from looking one at a time towards a genome wide model that simply says,

219
00:23:31,646 --> 00:23:35,486
If I plot the effect size in Europeans versus the effect size in Africans,

220
00:23:35,906 --> 00:23:41,216
is the slope close to one or not and is, you know, the advantage of playing, you know, one.

221
00:23:41,606 --> 00:23:45,616
So is and in fact, size is predictive really well.

222
00:23:46,976 --> 00:23:53,156
And you can label that as a correlation that the causal effect or a genetic correlation across ancestries, if you will.

223
00:23:53,456 --> 00:23:56,546
But it's really just saying whether the effect sizes are the same or not.

224
00:23:57,536 --> 00:24:07,946
And the way we solve this problem is through a mixed model approach in which we leverage the fact that old all human diseases are kind of flagellum.

225
00:24:08,156 --> 00:24:16,886
And we're literally just figuring out a genetic relationship matrix between pairs of individuals that is restricted to the Europeans,

226
00:24:17,166 --> 00:24:23,636
the segments that are restricted to the African segment. And we fit that through a model that's listed here on the right,

227
00:24:23,996 --> 00:24:30,836
but makes an assumption that the effect sizes are distinct across cultures and then they're allowed to be as distinct as possible.

228
00:24:31,196 --> 00:24:36,206
And we fit this parameters, which would be the covariance between the causal effects,

229
00:24:36,206 --> 00:24:43,976
but the which is just rolled here on the right side versus the, you know, Sigma Square, which we the variance or the heritability of.

230
00:24:45,536 --> 00:24:53,636
And under this model, this quantity, this covariance divide by the by the master, this correlation, right next week, we will label it.

231
00:24:53,636 --> 00:24:57,736
It will tell us whether the effect sizes are similar or not.

232
00:24:57,746 --> 00:25:01,406
So if this number is one, essentially that the genetic effects are all the same,

233
00:25:01,646 --> 00:25:06,086
if this correlation is zero, then essentially they're completely uncut. Hopefully that makes sense.

234
00:25:06,986 --> 00:25:12,576
And I should say that should interrupt me if. You have any questions along the way or not?

235
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:17,886
So as well as with all mathematic models,

236
00:25:17,896 --> 00:25:25,536
first we run a lot of simulations and I guide you to the preprint that it's listed there too, to see all the stories that we've done.

237
00:25:25,536 --> 00:25:34,116
But they are encapsulated in this figure on the left side, pretty much we observed that this method correctly recovers the genetic correlation,

238
00:25:35,286 --> 00:25:38,195
albeit a downward biased linear,

239
00:25:38,196 --> 00:25:47,765
because when if we mask all the true causes and we try to use the tags in the number of viruses small, but it's consistently downward.

240
00:25:47,766 --> 00:25:54,606
And so all that that motivates us to think that this is a lower band of the actual genetic correlation

241
00:25:54,606 --> 00:26:00,276
in really virtually any simulations that we've done or any breaking of the model leads to downward buys.

242
00:26:00,276 --> 00:26:09,216
And so you see here that we simulate 4.91 and you see that the that estimate is very close to that country.

243
00:26:10,536 --> 00:26:17,136
So then we applied to lots of lots of data and that here we kind of like try to look at all the data that we could get our hands on.

244
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:18,186
Again,

245
00:26:18,396 --> 00:26:26,946
guided by the fact that sample size matters in this case and that we find that it's very hard to look at individuals of African European admixture.

246
00:26:27,366 --> 00:26:33,786
So in the page study, which is a multi ancestry cohort, we looked in UK Biobank,

247
00:26:34,116 --> 00:26:40,175
we look at the all of us, which overall gives us a sample size of around 50,000 African,

248
00:26:40,176 --> 00:26:45,876
European mixed individuals, and that includes African Americans, that includes African women from UK Biobank,

249
00:26:45,876 --> 00:26:49,476
that includes all sorts of individuals that are self-reported different.

250
00:26:50,586 --> 00:26:54,786
So, you know, long story short, what we found is that the correlation is very, very low.

251
00:26:54,966 --> 00:27:01,955
So it's on the order of like 0.95. You can see the credible intervals there on the left side here you see us select

252
00:27:01,956 --> 00:27:05,556
the ten traits that we have that happened to have the larger sample size.

253
00:27:05,976 --> 00:27:08,526
And you can see that, you know, the, the,

254
00:27:08,686 --> 00:27:15,815
the credible interval or the credible range for our estimate varies widely across trait because of the sample size,

255
00:27:15,816 --> 00:27:20,346
because of number of cases by a trait. But in a meta analysis, it's very close to one.

256
00:27:20,916 --> 00:27:29,046
And I'll get you on the right side here where we compare what would happen if we look at across continents.

257
00:27:29,436 --> 00:27:34,026
So this is like if you look at African versus European, you get something on the wrong order, like a correlation.

258
00:27:34,026 --> 00:27:40,626
2.5.6 If you look at an African or European versus Asian, you can get something around point eight.

259
00:27:41,136 --> 00:27:45,256
And if you look at the mixed individuals, you get something that is point 95, which is much less about.

260
00:27:45,736 --> 00:27:52,836
So this is very consistent with this idea that by looking or by disentangling by and ancestry within the same individuals,

261
00:27:53,406 --> 00:27:58,716
your it it's more robust to this confounders by environment.

262
00:27:59,196 --> 00:28:07,596
And in many ways it's kind of illuminating as a local genetic interactions as a source or, you know, differential effect by ancestors.

263
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:14,466
It's also consistent with the fact that maybe environment contributes more when you look at, you know, across continents than when you look.

264
00:28:15,486 --> 00:28:18,686
So there's a debate that might come of my contribute to that.

265
00:28:18,686 --> 00:28:28,146
So, you know looking at transcontinental genetic ancestors so that that happens with that method, that sort of global method.

266
00:28:28,596 --> 00:28:32,946
We confirmed this by just focusing only on the genome, one significant snapshot,

267
00:28:32,946 --> 00:28:37,916
that's what's showing here now over here is just one genome wide significance snip.

268
00:28:38,256 --> 00:28:44,976
There's less power or this type of approach, but the number is very similar to what we got from our apologetic method.

269
00:28:45,036 --> 00:28:52,306
It's still, you know, higher than 90%. So the answer that we kind of convince ourselves after, you know,

270
00:28:52,326 --> 00:28:57,126
lots of work within the past year is that genetic causal effects seem to be the same percentage.

271
00:28:57,546 --> 00:29:05,435
So they seem to be, you know, very, very similar. And really what may be contributing to the fact that we see lack of transferability

272
00:29:05,436 --> 00:29:10,966
across population is the frequency and maybe tagging of unknown causal groups.

273
00:29:11,436 --> 00:29:16,986
But once we narrow down on the causal man, they seem to be operating the same across ancestries.

274
00:29:17,316 --> 00:29:27,156
That's kind of a carbon loop. So if you haven't heard my in my last statement, there's some inconsistency there.

275
00:29:27,726 --> 00:29:34,536
So how can just different frequencies contribute to such a low transferable, apologetic risk for the processes?

276
00:29:35,136 --> 00:29:42,006
And we started to try to impact that a little bit and I'll show you how that could occur.

277
00:29:43,206 --> 00:29:50,456
So. I don't want to spend as much time with probably all of you guys have heard of apologetic risk cause they're hyped to be,

278
00:29:50,456 --> 00:29:55,316
you know, the next best thing, the next life brand again, I guess, in personalized medicine.

279
00:29:55,736 --> 00:29:58,496
But essentially it's saying that in due course,

280
00:29:59,036 --> 00:30:05,096
we found a lot of small effects and minor none of these small effects can predict individuals that will get the disease.

281
00:30:05,456 --> 00:30:12,035
But if we aggregate them through some linear combination, we've seen nonlinear combination as well.

282
00:30:12,036 --> 00:30:18,416
But if we aggregate demand, we might be able to predict which individuals might be at the time of distribution

283
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:22,496
or which individuals might have higher genetic risk for some diseases.

284
00:30:22,766 --> 00:30:29,306
And we might be able to either, you know, do prevention or personalize their treatment decisions or in general,

285
00:30:30,626 --> 00:30:38,216
you know, change our our medication or change our clinical decision making based on their inherited categories.

286
00:30:39,866 --> 00:30:46,855
And like I was saying before, this is probably one of the biggest challenges in making polygenic risk boards applicable in the

287
00:30:46,856 --> 00:30:54,476
clinic is the fact that they seem to work much poorer the further away from the European ancestry.

288
00:30:55,766 --> 00:31:02,836
This figure that has been, you know, probably one of the most consequential figure in the past, you know,

289
00:31:02,846 --> 00:31:10,606
four or five years that you've seen it probably everywhere from Alicia martin and colleagues is showing the predictive accuracy,

290
00:31:10,616 --> 00:31:18,386
polygenic, risk course, all referred back to the European ancestry training that they see here on the first column.

291
00:31:18,776 --> 00:31:23,456
Seriously 100% European Ancestry Angel videos that if you move to, you know,

292
00:31:23,646 --> 00:31:32,046
preschool marks from American individuals, then you see that that 50% South Asian, East Asian Africanism.

293
00:31:33,276 --> 00:31:37,016
And also, in fact, the way I put the code mark, it's unclear what America means.

294
00:31:37,316 --> 00:31:41,696
It's like are these are these folks that are coming from the U.S.?

295
00:31:41,736 --> 00:31:44,456
Are these folks that self-identify as American?

296
00:31:44,726 --> 00:31:53,516
You know, there's a lot of admixture happening in various different forms and not that there's huge error bars there for some American individuals.

297
00:31:53,786 --> 00:32:01,316
It might be point nine. I curious if when Europeans for some American individuals might be 4.5.

298
00:32:02,666 --> 00:32:13,736
So we we try to unpack, you know, the spread of of of of performance with the idea that maybe a mixture is driving a lot of a lot of the.

299
00:32:15,876 --> 00:32:17,466
And we're not new to this.

300
00:32:17,496 --> 00:32:27,096
This is work from a young mathison and many others that are trying to look at the transfer a little to positive response directly,

301
00:32:27,096 --> 00:32:31,056
not mixed individuals. And I apologize that they shift the scale.

302
00:32:31,056 --> 00:32:37,536
So now you have to look on the right side for like higher European ancestry versus on the left side, which is lower European ancestry.

303
00:32:38,466 --> 00:32:46,776
And the whites get security. And when they plotted here, they looked at multiple African American or African.

304
00:32:48,126 --> 00:32:52,896
Some of them are African-American, but some of them are African, European and mixed individuals from UK Biobank,

305
00:32:53,256 --> 00:32:58,476
and they find it here on the x axis, the average European ancestry proportion.

306
00:32:58,926 --> 00:33:07,716
So higher on the right, another one on the left. And you see how, you know, individuals that have less and less European ancestry in their genome,

307
00:33:07,836 --> 00:33:12,126
which would be on the left side, they have lower, lower of two or C in the politicians.

308
00:33:13,626 --> 00:33:20,136
So you see how this effect is not just a population wide, but it's from individual to individual, right?

309
00:33:20,136 --> 00:33:25,295
So individual that one African adolescents do.

310
00:33:25,296 --> 00:33:31,626
This is a risk factor for wall for diabetes, that kind of stuff that in this case is height.

311
00:33:31,806 --> 00:33:36,545
So it's it's it's it's kind of the fact that they call it polygenic risk score.

312
00:33:36,546 --> 00:33:48,905
It's it's a little bit but it's a lot of the that that's why I tend to use polygenic patients as a possibly yes but I should say that the

313
00:33:48,906 --> 00:33:58,246
statements extent of most common diseases so if you do the same thing for coronary artery disease or lipids or whatever you call cancers,

314
00:33:58,566 --> 00:34:00,046
you would see the exact same trends.

315
00:34:03,116 --> 00:34:13,106
And because you asked that question, the error bars here, I think the beer bars are across trends, across individuals.

316
00:34:13,526 --> 00:34:18,236
So essentially in this plot, they looked at a couple of hundred over 80 or 100 traits.

317
00:34:18,776 --> 00:34:23,936
And what they they plotted the bars here is the standard deviation across those terms.

318
00:34:26,416 --> 00:34:32,126
Any questions? All right,

319
00:34:32,966 --> 00:34:37,226
so now I should introduce to you the by event that we're we're kind of applying

320
00:34:37,556 --> 00:34:41,005
applied this data and this is for those of you that have never been to L.A.,

321
00:34:41,006 --> 00:34:45,656
this is a very colorful map of L.A. that we use.

322
00:34:45,746 --> 00:34:48,776
So it's somewhere there in the blue shaded version.

323
00:34:48,776 --> 00:34:54,836
There you have the color coded is based on on the self-reported race, ethnicity.

324
00:34:55,316 --> 00:35:01,736
And, you know, I don't know exactly how they they they actually, you know, color coded there,

325
00:35:01,736 --> 00:35:06,626
but it's presumably as a function of which one is the most the majority in that neighborhood.

326
00:35:07,016 --> 00:35:10,166
And the punchline here is that it's very colorful.

327
00:35:10,436 --> 00:35:14,486
You see a little in L.A., it's it's it's one of those cities where there's no majority.

328
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:18,806
There's the largest population of European ancestry.

329
00:35:18,806 --> 00:35:25,136
So you're like 40, 40 something percent and Hispanic, but not the 42% of a lot of other factors.

330
00:35:25,826 --> 00:35:34,886
You're on the right side. I'll show you a principle little a of of the first 40,000 genetic data from the Biobank matches your life.

331
00:35:35,846 --> 00:35:40,096
So this is literally patients that come through the clinic get they get biobank they get the families

332
00:35:40,146 --> 00:35:48,986
to participate in the study that was very similar to how the Michigan Biobank is described here.

333
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:53,365
And, you know, it's color coded based on genetic ancestry, not based on self-report.

334
00:35:53,366 --> 00:36:00,696
But the point that I'm making here is that it's very colorful and hopefully some of the colorful illness kind of matches what was here.

335
00:36:00,716 --> 00:36:07,526
So we see diversity in our bio then throughout, and I'll focus more on this in the next couple of slides.

336
00:36:10,256 --> 00:36:15,956
The kind of the message that we are kind of beginning to emerge from all the big events in here.

337
00:36:16,076 --> 00:36:19,646
This is the same plot that I showed you before at UCLA in Los Angeles.

338
00:36:19,916 --> 00:36:25,766
This is a plot from a recent paper in science by units at all that shows in a way,

339
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:29,426
more refined color scheme that we've been in because it's in science.

340
00:36:29,816 --> 00:36:37,016
They show what happens in Miami and the buyback at Mount Sinai and which is kind of like

341
00:36:37,046 --> 00:36:42,026
take home from this is that the fact that we assign clusters and promote this movie,

342
00:36:42,266 --> 00:36:50,906
the fact that we assign cluster is very suboptimal. It's clear that you can see that individuals kind of like span the entire range from, let's say,

343
00:36:51,356 --> 00:36:55,646
the European genetic hazard stream cluster all the way to African cluster and so on and so forth.

344
00:36:56,156 --> 00:37:01,406
So you see individuals happening, you know, kind of like occupying all sorts of space in this continuum.

345
00:37:02,036 --> 00:37:04,286
And that motivates us for, you know,

346
00:37:04,286 --> 00:37:13,166
trying to disentangle or try to see how do we incorporate this continuous way of looking at ancestry into polygenic risk.

347
00:37:15,116 --> 00:37:22,406
And just to make this a little bit more what happens in the film, the figures that I showed you before is that somebody,

348
00:37:22,796 --> 00:37:27,745
you know, ran this PCR test before then drew some circles around it all.

349
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:32,636
This individual says, you know, Europe, Africa, the East Asian and so on, and be assigned this label.

350
00:37:32,636 --> 00:37:39,596
So this clusters and then within every cluster, you know, they they computed some single metric of accuracy.

351
00:37:39,836 --> 00:37:45,985
And that's what you see is you so plotted. So you see European, Hispanic, Latino, American.

352
00:37:45,986 --> 00:37:51,456
So but that's kind of like the what happens under the hood every time that you see one of these, you know,

353
00:37:51,536 --> 00:37:58,126
organic resource decay, you know, as a performance ticking as as further you move away from Europe.

354
00:38:00,116 --> 00:38:03,686
I'll try to argue in the next couple of slides. Yes.

355
00:38:03,926 --> 00:38:07,076
So what does accuracy mean, Amara? Absolute, exactly.

356
00:38:07,826 --> 00:38:15,236
Accuracy in this case means that they are somewhere between the polygenic score and the trade back in a test LP.

357
00:38:19,916 --> 00:38:26,116
When you calculate the polygenic risk, or do you scale it once and use the same scale across all your samples?

358
00:38:26,116 --> 00:38:29,446
So do you scale it in every so.

359
00:38:29,476 --> 00:38:33,686
That's a great question, which if you give me ten slides, I'll, I'll get back to it.

360
00:38:34,226 --> 00:38:46,706
Except for this one, they don't reach scale because they can put this R square in each of the population pipelines and yeah, the risk killing.

361
00:38:47,396 --> 00:38:52,186
I'm going to argue that we need to do a risk. Okay.

362
00:38:52,186 --> 00:38:58,876
So this clustering way to to think about the impact of genetic cancer risk or prediction comes with at least

363
00:38:58,876 --> 00:39:04,116
three caveats that we'll try to convince you that and probably you already kind of like hinted towards it.

364
00:39:04,456 --> 00:39:11,956
So the first one is that by assigning a single number to in the entire population ignore the fact that there's variability across individual.

365
00:39:12,646 --> 00:39:17,686
I don't know why this is so ignored by scientists in a number to the table that African-Americans

366
00:39:17,686 --> 00:39:22,026
ignore the fact that individuals that have more or less African ancestry then,

367
00:39:23,286 --> 00:39:29,446
you know, they'll have different expected appearance. The second one is the arbitrary boundary.

368
00:39:29,896 --> 00:39:38,756
And the third one is there's a lot of people that are left out from this clustering so that it's a little bit into the individual variables.

369
00:39:39,316 --> 00:39:47,446
So if I take the cluster of East Asian Americans and UCLA and then I run another principal component just on those individual labels that move there,

370
00:39:47,776 --> 00:39:50,926
then you start seeing more interesting, you know, clusters.

371
00:39:51,046 --> 00:39:56,176
So you see individuals that are of Filipino ancestry, individual Korean, individual, Japanese.

372
00:39:56,416 --> 00:40:01,456
It seems very silly to assign a single accuracy barrier to all of them while ignoring the fact that,

373
00:40:01,456 --> 00:40:04,876
you know, these individuals are really for forming different subjects.

374
00:40:05,896 --> 00:40:08,746
So there's variability within every clusters.

375
00:40:10,066 --> 00:40:16,846
The other one is, you know, like I said, assigning a single value for the table and mixed individuals in this case, let's say African-American,

376
00:40:17,986 --> 00:40:25,696
makes this very unreasonable guesses where you take two individuals that just happened to be on the one side or the other of the boundaries,

377
00:40:26,716 --> 00:40:32,876
and you would assign them totally different IQ. So you might have an individual that you might think that is, you know,

378
00:40:32,956 --> 00:40:39,645
has an accuracy and are square two versus point four, because then you assign them to different clusters.

379
00:40:39,646 --> 00:40:46,726
And that seems very unusual and problematic given that this individual is very similar in terms of their genetic risk.

380
00:40:47,356 --> 00:40:53,416
And finally, there's a lot of individuals that are left unclassified by all these clustering techniques.

381
00:40:53,686 --> 00:40:59,866
And that was a question that I don't know what this was moving forward, but that was a question that, you know, some of you asked me over lunch.

382
00:41:00,496 --> 00:41:06,706
We actually looked more thoroughly and more and more individuals over time get to be, you know,

383
00:41:07,066 --> 00:41:12,676
so complex in terms of genetic ancestries that all these clustering methods, you know, just fail to produce.

384
00:41:12,686 --> 00:41:22,726
And so if you see in adolescence, after we did our best, we have around 6% economic growth, 5% and finally 4%.

385
00:41:23,056 --> 00:41:29,806
And there's reason to believe that the numbers will keep on growing up over time because individuals will have more and more complex.

386
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:33,696
You know, they'll move to different places and the genetic counselor will continue to jump.

387
00:41:35,026 --> 00:41:45,706
And so our idea is to try to incorporate what we call genetic assets continuum and to come up with an individual based measure of actions.

388
00:41:46,126 --> 00:41:53,146
And so already has to take the clustering method approach with this label labeled individuals.

389
00:41:53,446 --> 00:41:56,155
And just simply, again, I developed this moving,

390
00:41:56,156 --> 00:42:03,766
but just move it to a way where we can assign a distance for a given individual as, as farther away from the training data.

391
00:42:04,276 --> 00:42:11,596
And in terms of distance here, we look at Euclidean distance and PC space, but believe me that you would try the bunch of things.

392
00:42:11,986 --> 00:42:15,976
All the things that I'm going to say today are kind of insensitive to the choice of the distance.

393
00:42:17,026 --> 00:42:20,866
But there's a very interesting thing about how you weight this species.

394
00:42:21,946 --> 00:42:27,406
Okay, so after you get the distance, instead of having this like clumps of single number for populations,

395
00:42:27,706 --> 00:42:38,086
you can actually estimate an individual form of accuracy for a project risk score and hopefully that that individual metric will go down for us.

396
00:42:39,376 --> 00:42:43,426
How do we go about estimating this? I know. I don't know why this slide of people moving,

397
00:42:44,806 --> 00:42:49,635
but essentially you can write down the mathematics of what will be the correlation between the genetic

398
00:42:49,636 --> 00:42:55,216
risk score and the genetic values of the general is the estimate of interest for apologetic risk score.

399
00:42:55,636 --> 00:43:01,486
And you can write it down essentially under some Bayesian approach and has that that that form.

400
00:43:01,816 --> 00:43:06,646
Again, you can read more about it in the paper that we put out on how do you actually go about estimating it?

401
00:43:07,036 --> 00:43:14,136
But essentially you can take the posterior of the variance of the genetic value divided by the, you know,

402
00:43:14,146 --> 00:43:24,706
the heritability and say essentially and that gives you an estimated measure of R squared for every individual the posterior genetic value it's

403
00:43:24,706 --> 00:43:35,056
estimated by sampling from from a method that gives you a polygenic risk for such a self disability to again I'm happy to dive into the details of it.

404
00:43:35,386 --> 00:43:40,755
It gets very complicated very fast in this space with a it's I'm happy to write the

405
00:43:40,756 --> 00:43:46,306
equation for you and try to drive them in terms of two paths we're approximating it with,

406
00:43:46,306 --> 00:43:50,625
you know, the heritability of the tree. And that's an approximate. All right.

407
00:43:50,626 --> 00:44:01,026
So how does. Look in in real data. So this is real know data from UK Biobank where we similarly data in the white British individuals.

408
00:44:01,206 --> 00:44:03,006
That's on the left side over there on top.

409
00:44:03,306 --> 00:44:14,556
And that we estimate this quantity as we look at individuals of different European ancestry and and more within UK but so you can buy bank

410
00:44:14,556 --> 00:44:23,016
is a collection of half a million individuals collected within the UK and after they collected they reported where they're coming from,

411
00:44:23,406 --> 00:44:33,306
although they're living in the UK. So we see their that accuracy begins to drop quite linearly as the genetic distance

412
00:44:33,666 --> 00:44:39,066
moves these people away from the training data which is labeled as white British.

413
00:44:39,906 --> 00:44:50,126
And you see that, for example, even if you move between individuals that are from Italy or Poland or let's say India,

414
00:44:50,136 --> 00:44:55,806
so you see that is that there's a decay in the accuracy that it happens to be.

415
00:44:57,276 --> 00:45:05,645
Now, this is an estimate. So we can actually validate this by just building individuals and then computing this are spread between simulated people.

416
00:45:05,646 --> 00:45:10,566
So it's simulated trade and actual values and we see exactly the same.

417
00:45:10,836 --> 00:45:15,946
So we see that our approximation works false and moreover we have lots of other results,

418
00:45:15,946 --> 00:45:21,456
but that kind of convince us that by approximating the security you get a pretty good result.

419
00:45:22,906 --> 00:45:25,846
The really interesting bit happens when we actually look at real people.

420
00:45:26,206 --> 00:45:36,256
So here's real data in the atmosphere when I'm covering this relationship between the genetic distance of the x axis and the individual level.

421
00:45:36,736 --> 00:45:45,256
Polygenic expected polygenic accuracy. So if you thought there's one individual and I followed that in all these different populations,

422
00:45:46,396 --> 00:45:56,356
or with the idea that maybe we can see whether they're populations, where they're just where genetic distance does not impact items.

423
00:45:56,866 --> 00:46:03,556
And so first approximation, there's no such organism. So genetic distance impacts accuracy in all population.

424
00:46:03,976 --> 00:46:09,406
So there's nothing really special about that mix individual where all that makes sense or we're all

425
00:46:10,156 --> 00:46:17,296
we all have some distance from the training might the that's a quality on the quantitative sense.

426
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:22,126
It is true that if you focus on the mix individuals like Hispanic, Latino and Germany,

427
00:46:22,126 --> 00:46:29,856
the correlation is closer to minus one versus if you look at, you know, more homogeneous population where the correlation is not as right.

428
00:46:30,406 --> 00:46:36,626
But that's a secondary. So just focusing on European-American that are labeled as from.

429
00:46:38,476 --> 00:46:45,555
We do see from that to that source the closest and the furthest that there are, there's a roughly 6% decrease.

430
00:46:45,556 --> 00:46:50,656
So individuals are further away from the UK by British.

431
00:46:50,986 --> 00:46:58,066
They vary, but there's like a 6% increase. We see a much bigger if you focus on mixed individuals,

432
00:46:58,366 --> 00:47:07,816
which is what you would expect because genetic ancestry has much wider variability up to essentially the closest half.

433
00:47:08,386 --> 00:47:13,126
I'm curious about similar to Europeans, while the furthest have an experience that it's roughly half.

434
00:47:13,696 --> 00:47:22,956
And in fact if you just plot it in the same scale in the blue are European-American individuals within our Biobank in the same color plots.

435
00:47:22,966 --> 00:47:28,126
You know, we see that, you know, the top or the closest have the same reputations, the furthest.

436
00:47:29,776 --> 00:47:35,236
And finally, just to kind of orient about what happens, let's look at all the data.

437
00:47:37,666 --> 00:47:43,216
We see that there's way more variability across individuals that across population late.

438
00:47:43,726 --> 00:47:47,386
And that's what I'm trying to show you in this. So this is what happens in Europeans.

439
00:47:47,896 --> 00:47:56,786
This is what happens in Hispanic, Latino. This is what happens in South Asians, East Asians and African-Americans.

440
00:47:57,376 --> 00:48:06,076
So you see a consistent linear decrease in the accuracy as you move further away from the training data where this polygenic risk where.

441
00:48:10,416 --> 00:48:13,596
Most of that stuff that I showed you before is one example trees.

442
00:48:14,046 --> 00:48:17,676
But really we tried to look at all the trees that we could put our hands on.

443
00:48:18,006 --> 00:48:23,556
Some of them are listed here until first approximation, there's no trade where this does not fall.

444
00:48:23,946 --> 00:48:29,706
So this is kind of answering your question probably for the lowest correlation that we will observe

445
00:48:29,706 --> 00:48:36,845
from any trade was -$0.20 across eight or so of the trees spanning all sorts of different,

446
00:48:36,846 --> 00:48:41,226
different waters. And that also holds across biomass. So that's UK Biobank.

447
00:48:41,226 --> 00:48:48,786
This is an adolescent UCLA. And then even if you look at just the European Americans, not us, there's still a much higher coverage.

448
00:48:49,926 --> 00:48:51,756
Okay, so that's all about accuracy.

449
00:48:51,766 --> 00:48:58,746
The second question is and the final question is whether the polytechnic researchers themselves actually vary with genetics.

450
00:48:59,586 --> 00:49:04,776
So so far I showed you how accuracy goes down the further,

451
00:49:06,096 --> 00:49:14,136
but how about the polygenic scores themselves and I put to me that the genetic risk or the measure of genetic risk or measure of

452
00:49:14,136 --> 00:49:22,626
genetic value so it could go down or up as a function of maybe the genetics of that particular trait bears with or with ancestry.

453
00:49:22,896 --> 00:49:26,916
Or it could be a biased estimate of genetic risk.

454
00:49:28,266 --> 00:49:36,486
So what we found is that all the pigs is 80 to 94, so virtually all actually have a significant correlation with the genetic distance.

455
00:49:37,056 --> 00:49:41,226
So all apologetic resource, very cells of cross ancestry,

456
00:49:41,796 --> 00:49:47,616
but unlike the unlike the the accuracy, the magnitude and signs that it's all over the place.

457
00:49:47,976 --> 00:49:53,346
And so some for some traits it goes up for some reason goes down. And that's kind of a reflection of maybe true signal.

458
00:49:53,496 --> 00:50:01,146
So selection changing this or most likely some bias inference in the in the genetic predictors.

459
00:50:01,836 --> 00:50:05,106
And I'm going to simplify this with just two example traits and then I'll finish.

460
00:50:05,436 --> 00:50:10,505
One is about height where we see on the top this is the apologetic risk or just in

461
00:50:10,506 --> 00:50:18,696
Europeans going down just in the according to the distance in the training data.

462
00:50:19,116 --> 00:50:24,335
So you see how it goes down the progenitor score there and then matches really well with that with actually

463
00:50:24,336 --> 00:50:30,186
what we see measured for this is the average height of this individual's bid across the genetic distance.

464
00:50:30,606 --> 00:50:34,895
And some people have used this as a sign of, you know, natural selection.

465
00:50:34,896 --> 00:50:38,946
Maybe genetics drives the difference. North to South Europe.

466
00:50:38,946 --> 00:50:40,985
Europe or in all that works,

467
00:50:40,986 --> 00:50:51,186
have reason that this is an artifact of incomplete accounting for population structure when estimating the weights for the project groups.

468
00:50:52,566 --> 00:50:57,336
This is the neutrophil count that I showed you before. And what you see here is that, you know,

469
00:50:57,396 --> 00:51:03,246
neutrophil polygenic risk for goes up at some genetic distance while the measure resistance actually goes down.

470
00:51:04,536 --> 00:51:15,276
And this is again probably, you know, modest probably indicating the encoding of this Duffy snip that has such a oversize role in that.

471
00:51:17,676 --> 00:51:23,405
So the point that I'm trying to make here is that we should time that we use any polygenic risk before any disease.

472
00:51:23,406 --> 00:51:32,316
We should put it across the continuum. Just one reason about what could in fact these correlations before we actually use it in diverse individuals.

473
00:51:33,096 --> 00:51:38,266
So in conclusions I cover lots of stuff and I kind of like us.

474
00:51:38,466 --> 00:51:45,306
I didn't go into a lot of details on, you know, please reach out if you if you have any comments.

475
00:51:45,306 --> 00:51:51,426
I would like to go into specific ones. Hopefully, I convinced you that we have lots of methods for this individual.

476
00:51:51,436 --> 00:52:00,815
So we don't don't want to remove any of those individuals from all the studies, all the all the all the methods that I showed you before are actually,

477
00:52:00,816 --> 00:52:06,366
you know, we put them in this and this can do anywhere from mapping all the way to project risk.

478
00:52:06,366 --> 00:52:12,126
Or there's also, you know, very nice software package from Elizabeth Atkins and others like Tracker.

479
00:52:12,366 --> 00:52:18,786
So we have lots of methodologies for mixed individuals. Public companies are that causal events are similar represents the streets.

480
00:52:18,876 --> 00:52:27,096
So to a first approximation we believe that difference and frequencies are really the culprit for why polygenic risk course you know

481
00:52:27,756 --> 00:52:36,786
like and performance across ancestry we are I'm a firm believer that any time that we look at any positive risk towards the clinic,

482
00:52:37,086 --> 00:52:42,606
we should first interpret it through the lens of genetic ancestry and in a continuous fashion.

483
00:52:43,266 --> 00:52:50,075
And you know, by looking at individual level, it's probably gives us a different look to where it's all we can identify.

484
00:52:50,076 --> 00:52:56,976
Subsets of patients, subset of individuals for which. Well, Jennifer sports were great and we can use them in the in practice.

485
00:52:57,546 --> 00:53:05,646
So I'll stop here by acknowledging a lot of the folks that created the UCLA Biobank is just believe it or not this is just part of them.

486
00:53:06,336 --> 00:53:09,256
Those of you that the. But I'm back here in Michigan,

487
00:53:09,256 --> 00:53:15,976
probably recognize how big of an endeavor it is to create a biobank with a medical system that was built as part of them

488
00:53:16,306 --> 00:53:24,945
and ultimately knowledge of the all the people that have done most of the work that I'm actually before them and say,

489
00:53:24,946 --> 00:53:28,056
gee, hopefully we can do something. All right.

490
00:53:28,066 --> 00:53:31,606
So I'll stop here and hopefully you guys have questions.

491
00:53:38,236 --> 00:53:44,566
Let's start to see if some students had questions before the faculty actually pulled.

492
00:53:46,276 --> 00:53:59,266
If anybody knows. I think whoever asks the question gets one of these squares and then they laugh and laugh.

493
00:53:59,506 --> 00:54:04,306
So when you're evaluating the R squared by genetic distance for you,

494
00:54:04,396 --> 00:54:11,176
evaluating the R squared in an all of the sample together instead of like the different populations,

495
00:54:11,176 --> 00:54:14,746
like how you set your theory comparing R squared in the different populations.

496
00:54:15,526 --> 00:54:20,776
Yeah. So we're looking at one, there's two ways that we did so one is by an individual.

497
00:54:21,166 --> 00:54:26,846
So we have an estimate of that size or all the individuals at this genetic distance.

498
00:54:26,866 --> 00:54:29,026
This is what we estimate the R squared would be.

499
00:54:29,116 --> 00:54:37,336
So if you sample an infinite amount of individuals just for a genetic distance, that will be the estimate that our method predicts contains.

500
00:54:37,966 --> 00:54:41,596
And then to validate that we bend individual across genetic distance.

501
00:54:42,706 --> 00:54:47,986
And that's been computed in a test held out DNA.

502
00:54:48,436 --> 00:54:52,846
But we observed A, B, R squared between the peaks and the treatment.

503
00:54:53,506 --> 00:55:00,716
And that's how we validated that. Everything lines up. Questions.

504
00:55:05,266 --> 00:55:08,586
Family. The tough questions come from.

505
00:55:12,446 --> 00:55:23,095
There was any reason to think it has to be a one dimensional metric if it matters for PC World in PC two or maybe PC into one dimension.

506
00:55:23,096 --> 00:55:28,286
But you can imagine a two dimensional space with customers were sort of interpreting things.

507
00:55:28,916 --> 00:55:33,866
Yes, that's right. And we did this just for convenience, just as a first step.

508
00:55:34,406 --> 00:55:38,966
So we looked at the top 20 pieces and we look at the Euclidean distance across them.

509
00:55:38,966 --> 00:55:44,926
So that gives us a single number. But you're absolutely right that there's no reason to just look at one dimension.

510
00:55:46,196 --> 00:55:53,366
And we hope that in the future we might be able to look at not just the PC, but other ways in which, you know,

511
00:55:53,966 --> 00:55:59,636
we can come up with measures in multiple dimensions that give us a continuous reasoning

512
00:55:59,636 --> 00:56:04,916
of how one individual's further away from the training data of the split screen.

513
00:56:05,396 --> 00:56:08,426
Yeah, that's a terrific suggestion.

514
00:56:08,426 --> 00:56:13,826
That kind of probably motivates some of our future work or somebody else's future work as well.

515
00:56:14,366 --> 00:56:21,556
And I should say that that's probably goes really well with maybe looking at other factors that we typically add when you predict it,

516
00:56:21,656 --> 00:56:30,026
such as environmental and other types of variables that we typically add when we

517
00:56:30,176 --> 00:56:34,196
take the pictures to actually predict relative or absolute risk for our patients.

518
00:56:38,636 --> 00:56:42,085
So I don't work in genetics, so just hope this isn't a silly question,

519
00:56:42,086 --> 00:56:51,206
but that the supposed genetic risk score weights the snips and the assumption is of the way to the same across the races,

520
00:56:51,956 --> 00:56:58,496
that if there are interactions with genetic genetic factors, with environmental factors, then assuming that wouldn't be the case.

521
00:56:59,336 --> 00:57:02,306
Is that a reasonable assumption, if that's true? Yes.

522
00:57:02,366 --> 00:57:11,716
So the the the the the the the basic assignment polygenic risk course is that, you know, what's that to the causal band?

523
00:57:11,726 --> 00:57:17,816
The weight that's been used is the same when you employ it across different ancestry groups.

524
00:57:19,076 --> 00:57:21,586
But then there are ways because you know,

525
00:57:21,646 --> 00:57:30,926
we see that apologetic records in various different ancestry vary across different, different, different genetic distances.

526
00:57:31,466 --> 00:57:38,486
We can rescale the predictions of the apologetic risk course, which essentially would mean to readjust the weight because everything's linear.

527
00:57:38,726 --> 00:57:43,826
We need to readjust every way that we use in the model according to this genetic distance.

528
00:57:44,786 --> 00:57:51,716
So to account for the relative contributions, you read the same material to control the sequence, which might not be the case.

529
00:57:51,806 --> 00:58:01,926
So if you file for the case, yes. And there's like there in many ways, there's more work to be done about how do we model?

530
00:58:02,156 --> 00:58:09,156
Do you buy this for straight we borrow.

531
00:58:10,586 --> 00:58:14,756
Okay. So it's kind of related to Rod's question.

532
00:58:14,756 --> 00:58:20,096
So when you showed at the start, when you look at admixture individuals,

533
00:58:20,096 --> 00:58:33,446
your figures for the causal variants look pretty similar to each other within admixture individuals depending on who you're choosing.

534
00:58:33,446 --> 00:58:43,526
Like if you're choosing African-American individuals, there still is a pretty most individuals are closer to 80%.

535
00:58:44,036 --> 00:58:47,245
Right. And mixed African to European.

536
00:58:47,246 --> 00:58:55,946
So the genetic background that they're feeling globally when you think about interactions is still pretty similar.

537
00:58:56,246 --> 00:59:01,506
So when you try to infer that they're I think all you talk about local, right?

538
00:59:01,526 --> 00:59:08,576
You can infer what the local thing is, but it doesn't actually say if there are different genetic backgrounds.

539
00:59:08,756 --> 00:59:14,846
Right. More different than you get in admixture individuals that are influencing those effects.

540
00:59:15,076 --> 00:59:16,106
Yeah. Yeah, it's very subtle.

541
00:59:16,466 --> 00:59:25,166
So most of the I think that the average genome, one assistant African-American in the US is a 28 plus minus the standard is 4.12.

542
00:59:25,676 --> 00:59:33,566
So there's, there's that the range is somewhere between, let's say 60%, the average up to 100%.

543
00:59:34,916 --> 00:59:42,866
But you're absolutely right that the the the backgrounds that might exist in other ancestries might be

544
00:59:43,076 --> 00:59:49,466
wider variance and that may allow for the environments that contribute more to body were just different.

545
00:59:49,466 --> 00:59:57,116
E will correspond to different phenotyping that will introduce different in different ways and in many ways they can.

546
00:59:57,566 --> 01:00:02,456
And this is not cooperating, but it will seem like it's going forward by itself.

547
01:00:02,546 --> 01:00:08,726
Let's see if I can make it go backwards. I showed you and I went super fast.

548
01:00:09,056 --> 01:00:15,506
My apologies, but who wants to do something?

549
01:00:16,016 --> 01:00:19,016
But this is exactly what this plant is trying to show.

550
01:00:19,346 --> 01:00:25,286
So this is African, European mixture and there's a bunch of populations there.

551
01:00:25,286 --> 01:00:28,986
But for first of all, we can consider what you said, 80% plus minus.

552
01:00:29,336 --> 01:00:34,436
Right. This is African versus European. So this is people from Africa versus people from Europe.

553
01:00:34,766 --> 01:00:38,116
And looking applying a very similar model. Right.

554
01:00:38,336 --> 01:00:39,926
Ignore the statistical part.

555
01:00:40,316 --> 01:00:47,606
But you see that the the similarity with the causal effect is, you know, pulling back here and this is, you know, 0.6.5 points.

556
01:00:47,726 --> 01:00:55,766
So you see a massive difference, which in many ways this was kind of, to me, the most surprising finding in this one,

557
01:00:56,246 --> 01:01:04,826
which suggests that there's a lot of e or environment that either fluctuates between Europeans and African exist.

558
01:01:05,396 --> 01:01:09,896
But yeah, you know, that could indicate that there's a lot of argy bargy that exists.

559
01:01:10,016 --> 01:01:15,656
So that's 111 on a professional, you know, direction of work.

560
01:01:15,926 --> 01:01:20,156
Or it could be like this, the phenotype that we measure and this individuals could be it'll be different.

561
01:01:20,786 --> 01:01:24,536
There's a lot of work that looked at, you know, of mental health phenotypes.

562
01:01:24,536 --> 01:01:30,206
And those are measured, totally different across continents, which will induce looking at different traits and methods.

563
01:01:30,836 --> 01:01:34,616
But that's consistent with exactly what you were saying that.

564
01:01:36,506 --> 01:01:41,696
There might be a lot of e that we need to take into account, particularly if you look at different continents.

565
01:01:42,236 --> 01:01:49,766
I guess I was trying to actually say the opposite that you don't know if you're if everybody wants 80%.

566
01:01:49,766 --> 01:02:00,056
And next year, for argument's sake. Right. Those European and those African illegals are feeling the same genetic background.

567
01:02:00,536 --> 01:02:03,596
So we pretend there's no difference in environment.

568
01:02:03,896 --> 01:02:09,286
Right now, you take in you put them in somebody who is European or you put that in someone who's African,

569
01:02:09,296 --> 01:02:11,936
they're using a different genetic background.

570
01:02:12,596 --> 01:02:20,186
So you don't really have a way to, even from what you've done, say that it's not that it's environment and not genetics.

571
01:02:23,246 --> 01:02:26,996
Right. Because there that also varies.

572
01:02:27,026 --> 01:02:33,146
Yeah. But I think you're making the assumption that if you look at individuals with 80%, that it's always the same 80%.

573
01:02:33,746 --> 01:02:38,396
That's never the case. So that if you look at two individuals that have the same 80% African,

574
01:02:39,026 --> 01:02:44,605
the actual illegals that are summing up to be 80% are all over the all over the genome.

575
01:02:44,606 --> 01:02:48,266
So there's a randomization that happens there. I would agree with your statement.

576
01:02:48,686 --> 01:02:54,036
If you're assuming that individuals 80% are always have the same, let's say a well,

577
01:02:54,046 --> 01:03:00,116
a genetic program that's always the same 80% throughout the genome. But that's not really the case.

578
01:03:01,436 --> 01:03:05,516
But again, we can then discuss some African wrong.

579
01:03:06,566 --> 01:03:13,226
Right. So perfect. So the the main conclusions, I think all make sense to me.

580
01:03:14,246 --> 01:03:17,736
I'm curious about the your suggestions move forward.

581
01:03:18,236 --> 01:03:24,326
So what you observe these two seemingly contradicting things.

582
01:03:24,326 --> 01:03:32,966
One is the causal variance, while the positive effects are pretty consistent across the population, groups done that before.

583
01:03:34,566 --> 01:03:39,476
And thirdly, the transferability of the PR, the PGS.

584
01:03:39,596 --> 01:03:46,376
So what should we do? Yes, I think the Prospero, both of which is directly addressable by difference in frequencies.

585
01:03:46,916 --> 01:03:55,405
So I think that that would explain almost everything. I do think that in mixed individuals, the causal effects are almost always going to be the same.

586
01:03:55,406 --> 01:04:01,686
So we can, you know, use that knowledge in the sign and file calls.

587
01:04:01,696 --> 01:04:09,026
And I mean, the allele frequency will still filter when we design, you know, all sorts of methods from magic to project response.

588
01:04:10,136 --> 01:04:16,706
And when we look at transcontinental or other types of noninfectious, if you will,

589
01:04:17,126 --> 01:04:24,506
individuals that there's a role for a lot of environment to change the way we observe these things.

590
01:04:24,746 --> 01:04:32,716
Right. I think a lot of, you know, the reasoning cited is this environmental effect is possible.

591
01:04:32,846 --> 01:04:39,786
You know, we're focused on the UAS findings, mostly using European individuals.

592
01:04:39,836 --> 01:04:47,516
So there's some risk of needles maybe is very rare in the European, but quite common.

593
01:04:47,726 --> 01:04:50,966
So the point is probably ask it for your comment.

594
01:04:51,416 --> 01:04:54,596
Should we do more g ones in other cities? Yeah, of course. It's.

595
01:04:55,226 --> 01:05:01,226
I think it's I think it's just the overall set of the causal variance are yes, there are too much.

596
01:05:01,316 --> 01:05:09,176
So maybe I didn't emphasize that enough. Yes. There's all the data that we're using and all these studies are things that were observed,

597
01:05:09,686 --> 01:05:14,216
you know, mostly in the Europeans, because in Europeans we have large sample size.

598
01:05:14,516 --> 01:05:17,306
There are a lot of variance that contributes to disease that are, let's say,

599
01:05:17,306 --> 01:05:22,736
absent or low frequency in Europeans and may have high frequencies in, you know, non Europeans.

600
01:05:23,186 --> 01:05:28,316
And, you know, I can make an instant or I didn't make any statements about that because we haven't really observed it.

601
01:05:28,676 --> 01:05:33,506
So we definitely need, you know, more studies in non European for sure.

602
01:05:34,526 --> 01:05:44,176
And that's just one principal level you it's probably not all of you know that you know by analyzing this these populations together we can,

603
01:05:44,186 --> 01:05:48,235
you know, narrow down where the causal variants are more, more, more accurately.

604
01:05:48,236 --> 01:05:52,946
And we can essentially answer these questions about the existence of Dubai or not.

605
01:05:53,876 --> 01:06:03,026
So by any means. I didn't want to make the point that that we should, you know, study only a homogeneous population by the country.

606
01:06:03,146 --> 01:06:12,386
I think looking get as much diversity as possible kind of gives us this new insights about diversity mean you genetic diversity in our studies.

607
01:06:15,296 --> 01:06:26,996
So I'm a little bit confused when you say that you expect that environmental differences make a big difference in transcontinental population.

608
01:06:27,386 --> 01:06:32,666
That seems to be in a contradiction with a very nice linear decay of the right.

609
01:06:33,116 --> 01:06:38,816
That is much more my. What would. Perspective. It's really just differences in language, definitely around a little frequency.

610
01:06:39,396 --> 01:06:45,686
Yeah. Yeah, that's that's where I find really that's where, you know, I think it's worthwhile to dissect.

611
01:06:45,686 --> 01:06:48,716
This is what I think it's consistent with, like into your body.

612
01:06:48,716 --> 01:06:54,536
But I'm not fully convinced yet that it's that you buy or it's just, you know, bad estimation.

613
01:06:54,656 --> 01:07:01,546
We don't. Hopefully we can tackle.

614
01:07:04,556 --> 01:07:15,106
Other questions. In fact, given everything you know, these are not mine to give it up.

615
01:07:17,536 --> 01:07:22,906
I was thinking about this contra memorial without, like, recovering facts or concepts such as.

616
01:07:23,686 --> 01:07:28,996
I just do like. Like focusing on a specific reason or saying nonsense,

617
01:07:29,086 --> 01:07:35,516
like trying to calibrate or just nonsense rather than frankly saying one causal snippet is causal for once,

618
01:07:35,576 --> 01:07:38,716
the exact cause of what the other is causing.

619
01:07:38,986 --> 01:07:44,756
I've got to ask you, is that an average proportional or is just like each causal narrative?

620
01:07:44,776 --> 01:07:55,546
And what's that? Is that possible that we have potentially you could have causal violence or the tactics that caused such resentment?

621
01:07:55,816 --> 01:07:56,566
And therefore,

622
01:07:56,656 --> 01:08:05,376
even though they did have like very similar causally facts across that substrate in terms of the contribution of the heart of the script.

623
01:08:05,776 --> 01:08:10,186
But there's still different commonality across different types aspects.

624
01:08:10,736 --> 01:08:13,966
Yeah, that's it's also just that they went super fast over that.

625
01:08:13,966 --> 01:08:21,226
So my apologies for not going. So in all, all this where we've finished different effects sizes and that's a problem.

626
01:08:21,406 --> 01:08:27,316
So we allow them to be assessed as clear. And we, we did it in two ways.

627
01:08:27,736 --> 01:08:34,726
But in one way is to average across all the variants of the genome in apologetic community by

628
01:08:34,726 --> 01:08:42,296
saying that the similarity in the genetic relationship matrix should match the similarity sizes.

629
01:08:42,676 --> 01:08:47,506
So this is the standard ramble type of approach, and that gives us that single number quantified.

630
01:08:48,016 --> 01:08:54,196
And then we did it the other way where we just looked at the top indexed variance of the G once before.

631
01:08:54,296 --> 01:08:58,336
Events of the slide before it's given allows me to do.

632
01:08:58,816 --> 01:09:04,096
So we did. This is where every dot here is one very uncomfortable digits.

633
01:09:04,666 --> 01:09:09,645
And in this case we did the clumping tool kind of and it played with a bunch of different

634
01:09:09,646 --> 01:09:14,266
ways to do it in terms of how do we account for the fact we don't have the costs.

635
01:09:14,746 --> 01:09:17,426
What you're saying you're saying that these words are not causal.

636
01:09:17,426 --> 01:09:25,716
We're looking at this that have been divided by region and we have the whole world and we might see something to go on, first of all.

637
01:09:25,716 --> 01:09:36,856
So we tried all the ways that we could look into it and we only see this, which is that that's why they call it either by index, by by find mapping.

638
01:09:37,786 --> 01:09:42,406
And I think this results in what our energy costs. So we did all the clumping.

639
01:09:45,046 --> 01:09:52,185
And then your other question, I think it's we can still see different effects sizes biased by particular regions.

640
01:09:52,186 --> 01:09:56,176
And you'll see here that there are some loci, especially those red ones there,

641
01:09:56,746 --> 01:10:03,976
where although overall it's very similar to one of the regions where it's really the case that the effects vary by ancestry.

642
01:10:04,996 --> 01:10:14,626
And then finally, I think it touches a little bit to your question about whether the the causal mechanism might be slightly different by ancestry.

643
01:10:15,046 --> 01:10:18,076
I don't know. It seems a little bit hard to say.

644
01:10:18,646 --> 01:10:27,856
But as far as all the work that we've done with or we've seen it slightly causal mechanism seems to be more or less similar across,

645
01:10:28,936 --> 01:10:33,316
albeit that bands might have different frequencies and it might explain different.

646
01:10:37,226 --> 01:10:42,826
Probably that that addresses the original question. One more.

647
01:10:47,046 --> 01:11:08,996
Okay. Let's thank. It's very difficult to do that under different circumstances.

648
01:11:10,696 --> 01:11:13,186
Yes. Know you.
