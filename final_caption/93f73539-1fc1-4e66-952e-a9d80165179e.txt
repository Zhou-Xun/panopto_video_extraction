00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:04,190
A balance sheet is a statement
of the assets, liabilities, and

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:09,060
equity of an organization at
a particular point in time.

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,750
A balance sheet can also
be described as a snapshot

4
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:14,910
of an organization's financial condition.

5
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:20,620
A balance sheet is broken up into two
sections, assets on the left-hand side and

6
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:23,790
liabilities and
equity on the right-hand side.

7
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:27,710
Assets always equal liabilities
plus equity, that is,

8
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:31,720
the balance sheet always balances.

9
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:36,270
Assets are the resources owned
by the organization, in general,

10
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:40,600
assets are broken down by
liquidity into current assets and

11
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,200
noncurrent, or long term assets.

12
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,270
Current assets include cash and

13
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:51,460
other assets that are expected to be
converted into cash within one year.

14
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:56,843
Examples include short-term financial
investments, accounts receivable,

15
00:00:56,843 --> 00:01:01,286
that is, money owed to the firm
by its customers, and inventory.

16
00:01:01,286 --> 00:01:05,579
Noncurrent or long-term assets are assets
that the organization expects to own for

17
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:07,560
more than one year.

18
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,413
Examples include the organization's land,
buildings, and equipment,

19
00:01:12,413 --> 00:01:18,339
also known as fixed assets, and
long-term financial investments.

20
00:01:18,339 --> 00:01:23,870
Liabilities are claims against the
organization's assets by outside creditors

21
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:30,030
such as suppliers, employees,
financial institutions and bond holders.

22
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:31,317
On the balance sheet,

23
00:01:31,317 --> 00:01:35,690
liabilities are listed in the order
in which they will be paid.

24
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:39,901
Current liabilities include liabilities
that are expected to be paid within

25
00:01:39,901 --> 00:01:40,490
one year.

26
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:45,660
Examples are accounts payable,
that is, money owed to suppliers.

27
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:50,780
Accrued salaries and wages payable,
that is, money owed to employees.

28
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:55,088
And notes payable, that is,
money owed to banks for short-term loans.

29
00:01:55,088 --> 00:01:59,862
Noncurrent are long-term
liabilities represent financing to

30
00:01:59,862 --> 00:02:04,101
the organization with maturities
of more than one year,

31
00:02:04,101 --> 00:02:08,270
examples include bank loans,
mortgages, and bonds.

32
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:10,056
Underneath all liabilities,

33
00:02:10,056 --> 00:02:14,280
the balance sheet lists
the equity of the organization.

34
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:19,184
Equity represents the portion of the
assets available to the owners after all

35
00:02:19,184 --> 00:02:26,109
liabilities have been paid.

36
00:02:26,109 --> 00:02:28,245
The difference between the assets and

37
00:02:28,245 --> 00:02:31,840
the liabilities is the equity
of the organization.

38
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,210
Equity is also known as net assets,
net worth, or ownership stake.

39
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:41,760
Equity represents the value of
the organization to its owners.

40
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,680
Assets always equal liabilities
plus equity, that is,

41
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,600
the balance sheet always balances.

42
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:53,407
This relationship is called
The Basic Accounting Equation.
