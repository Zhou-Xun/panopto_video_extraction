1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:07,020
Innovative interventions to achieve
health equity, promising approaches.

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:10,770
What role should government play in
addressing social determinants of health,

3
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:13,070
and where do we start?

4
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:16,780
These questions are important in your
health equity work, because governments

5
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:23,020
will only prioritize a limited range of
issues, based on available resources.

6
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:27,600
A critical question is what perform should
be undertaken, because they might result

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:33,320
in the biggest gains from using a social
determinants of health approach?

8
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,530
One comprehensive study that assessed the
value of a social determinants approach in

9
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:42,706
low income countries for life expectancy,
identified several areas for action.

10
00:00:42,706 --> 00:00:49,348
These included gender equality,
primary school enrollment,

11
00:00:49,348 --> 00:00:54,268
access to clean water,
a reduction in HIV, and

12
00:00:54,268 --> 00:01:02,220
political stability, among other results.

13
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:07,041
Some areas you would expect to be
influential, such as national income,

14
00:01:07,041 --> 00:01:09,141
educational expenditures, or

15
00:01:09,141 --> 00:01:16,190
employment were not associated with life
expectancy in these low income countries.

16
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:21,665
What might account for
this lack of findings in these areas?

17
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:24,590
How should the government respond?

18
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:26,600
Think of the US government.

19
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:31,130
Should public health officials divert
money away from the health care system

20
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:34,170
to address social determinants of health?

21
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:39,105
Why or why not?

22
00:01:39,105 --> 00:01:42,904
Nationally, who has control over
the US healthcare budget and

23
00:01:42,904 --> 00:01:49,982
what can be done to influence
these decision-makers.

24
00:01:49,982 --> 00:01:54,689
What type of policy initiatives may be
necessary to adequately reform healthcare

25
00:01:54,689 --> 00:02:00,794
expenditures to invest in
social determinants of health?

26
00:02:00,794 --> 00:02:05,107
What initiatives might be useful to
consider outside the healthcare system to

27
00:02:05,107 --> 00:02:09,970
improve health using healthcare resources?

28
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:12,510
Where do we go from here?

29
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:16,420
There are a number of directions you can
pursue to incorporate social determinants

30
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,470
of health in your work.

31
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:23,090
Although not always easy, the benefits
of this approach will bring us closer to

32
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:29,070
achieving health equity and improving
population health in this society.

33
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:31,820
Determining how governments
can be more proactive

34
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:35,630
in protecting the population's health.

35
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:39,220
Reviewing policies to determine
deferential application

36
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:43,080
that influences health and mental health.

37
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:48,570
Strengthening social networks at
multiple levels to effect health.

38
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:52,960
And assessing power differentials
in movements towards social change

39
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:57,480
are just a few ideas to consider.

40
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,300
With the knowledge you possess,
you can become an agent for

41
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:04,990
change in the national campaign
to achieve health equity.

42
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:08,590
How will you use this information?

43
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:13,326
Thank you for your time and
attention over the past few weeks.
