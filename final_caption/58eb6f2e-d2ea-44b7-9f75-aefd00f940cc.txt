1
00:00:00,651 --> 00:00:03,681
Yeah, well, this week I think it's an adjustment, isn't it?

2
00:00:06,291 --> 00:00:10,971
Well, and hopefully it might warm up a bit, but it'll probably still cool.

3
00:00:11,001 --> 00:00:14,871
And I think it's very cold enough for what's good for now.

4
00:00:15,861 --> 00:00:21,081
Okay. Today we're gonna be talking about aging in place and the importance of housing in neighborhoods.

5
00:00:21,741 --> 00:00:24,761
We just have a visiting scholar in our class right now.

6
00:00:24,771 --> 00:00:31,491
So Grayson Moffat is here. Dr. Norbert is going to be the guest speaker next week for biological, aging and immunosuppressants.

7
00:00:31,821 --> 00:00:35,961
She's just sitting in on the class today so she's she can be here.

8
00:00:36,171 --> 00:00:39,441
Thanks for having me. Wonderful, actually.

9
00:00:39,531 --> 00:00:44,331
You know what? Do you want to just have it? Just take a couple of minutes, introduce yourself and what you're doing so that the.

10
00:00:44,821 --> 00:00:49,221
I'm actually not going to be here next week. So great. It's going to be, you know, leading the class.

11
00:00:49,311 --> 00:00:52,341
Do you want to sort of introduce yourself and what you do?

12
00:00:52,701 --> 00:00:53,330
Yeah, well,

13
00:00:53,331 --> 00:01:00,891
I should that the most prominent feature is that I was trained by Phillip and I sat in her class for a number of years ago and she is well,

14
00:01:00,921 --> 00:01:09,171
she's the reason I was a technologist. So I trained in social and infectious disease epidemiology here, and they have a department.

15
00:01:09,831 --> 00:01:13,281
And I was told then and I knew Philip was heads going to roll,

16
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:19,881
but I was told that you will you don't study social determinants of infectious disease because that's not what sort of I'll do.

17
00:01:20,271 --> 00:01:23,441
And then a global pandemic hit, and that's what everybody does.

18
00:01:24,801 --> 00:01:30,410
But actually, it was in conversations with Phil that got me thinking about the ways that pathogens accelerate your aging processes.

19
00:01:30,411 --> 00:01:38,451
And so when I wanted to really dig into the immune system in biological systems of aging, and so I think a lot about how the social environment,

20
00:01:38,451 --> 00:01:44,721
including the neighborhood environment, gets under the skin to accelerate aging for some populations and not others.

21
00:01:44,721 --> 00:01:50,091
And what are the implications for a number of aging related decline in disease?

22
00:01:50,481 --> 00:01:59,300
So we work together quite a bit as our but I'm exclusively at ESR and have been since 2020 and say that to get to chat with you guys,

23
00:01:59,301 --> 00:02:03,270
this is like my lab group meetings and working with students and training.

24
00:02:03,271 --> 00:02:08,161
This is my favorite part of my job, so I'm excited to be able to talk with you guys next week.

25
00:02:08,681 --> 00:02:14,541
I know it's really exciting for us to be able to have recruited Chris back to Michigan for a faculty position at ESR,

26
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:22,020
and we've done a lot of collaborative work looking at the role of neighborhoods for tuberculosis and other in infectious disease.

27
00:02:22,021 --> 00:02:29,031
So, you know, place matters. So we'll get into that and talk specifically about the relevance of aging in place.

28
00:02:30,471 --> 00:02:37,660
So I wanted to like up to this point in the class, I've given you sort of some broad constructs to situate the rest of the class.

29
00:02:37,661 --> 00:02:45,251
So thinking about life course perspectives, thinking about inequality, thinking about ageism and structural ageism,

30
00:02:45,531 --> 00:02:49,850
now we're going to start using those concepts and kind of applying them to different substantive topic areas.

31
00:02:49,851 --> 00:02:56,691
So this is really thinking about how the place matters for healthy aging and how does inequality in what

32
00:02:56,691 --> 00:03:02,331
people are exposed to in both their home and their community environments shape their ability to be healthy,

33
00:03:02,751 --> 00:03:07,381
to live the long lives, and to be independent. We're going to talk.

34
00:03:07,891 --> 00:03:09,811
We have for the first half of the class,

35
00:03:09,811 --> 00:03:16,441
we're going to talk about neighborhoods and community environments and talk about some community audit tools that we're going to go into,

36
00:03:16,621 --> 00:03:20,670
what's going on inside the home, the housing environment. We'll take a break.

37
00:03:20,671 --> 00:03:27,601
And then Nick is going to be presenting a paper looking at the home environment and transitions to long term care.

38
00:03:27,991 --> 00:03:30,421
And then we'll have some group class discussion after that.

39
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:38,151
Before we jump in, I just like to see if anyone had any thoughts last week or anything that arose since our last class,

40
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:45,351
where they observed anything in terms of ageism or thought about ageism and structural ageism in their day to day interactions.

41
00:03:51,891 --> 00:04:05,031
When we measure something in that lens images and that's defined as like.

42
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:18,041
Unfair discriminatory treatment against. But I was wondering if like it could also be applied to all ages and.

43
00:04:20,401 --> 00:04:26,481
You know, sometimes younger. No, please, I.

44
00:04:27,121 --> 00:04:28,801
Yeah, that's a great point, actually.

45
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:35,281
It is something that is probably applied across the life course and something to think about with respect to how we

46
00:04:35,581 --> 00:04:41,461
how we think about how we stereotype certain people at a given age and what we what we think they can and cannot do.

47
00:04:41,911 --> 00:04:48,381
Yeah, that's a great point. Okay.

48
00:04:48,381 --> 00:04:55,611
So thinking about neighborhoods aging in place, the CDC defines this as the ability to live in one's home and community safely,

49
00:04:56,181 --> 00:04:59,631
independently and comfortably, regardless of age.

50
00:04:59,811 --> 00:05:07,671
It's not just that income or ability level. So what do we think about the community environment that can support aging in place?

51
00:05:08,451 --> 00:05:16,871
The World Health Organization in the early 2000 started recognizing that as the world's populations are aging,

52
00:05:16,881 --> 00:05:20,781
it's important to understand what can actually support aging in place.

53
00:05:21,411 --> 00:05:28,431
They started to do a lot of in-depth, qualitative work focus groups with older adults in different cities around the world.

54
00:05:29,451 --> 00:05:33,021
It's really widespread so that we're getting different cultural perspectives.

55
00:05:33,471 --> 00:05:39,800
And they developed this guide recognizing that there are these common elements that are coming up from speaking

56
00:05:39,801 --> 00:05:44,211
to older adults about what they wanted in their communities to help them be independent and to be healthy.

57
00:05:45,801 --> 00:05:52,011
So this Age Friendly Cities guide was developed, which is really going through the different aspects of what it means to be an age friendly city.

58
00:05:52,311 --> 00:05:58,041
And they developed a checklist that you can actually the communities can use to assess whether or not their community is age friendly.

59
00:05:58,821 --> 00:06:05,541
But these are the domains that they that they found that older adults were talking about the importance of these different dimensions.

60
00:06:05,931 --> 00:06:11,111
So older adults want to be involved. They want to be participating in the communities like we talked about last week.

61
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:14,631
They don't want to be segregated into nursing homes and just forgotten about.

62
00:06:15,531 --> 00:06:20,901
They want to be respected and feel part of the included in their society so related to ageism.

63
00:06:21,711 --> 00:06:26,961
They want to be able to be employed and participate in the community in terms of civic participation and voting.

64
00:06:28,191 --> 00:06:35,090
They want to be able to be able to communicate, to have the ability to have devices and assistive devices,

65
00:06:35,091 --> 00:06:41,181
to allow people to communicate, even when they're losing their vision and their hearing or they're getting cognitive problems.

66
00:06:42,261 --> 00:06:45,951
Housing and transportation are also important in terms of affordable housing,

67
00:06:45,951 --> 00:06:50,001
accessible housing and transportation when you're no longer able to drive.

68
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:56,420
Are you able are there other sources of transportation, public transportation that are age friendly, that don't you know,

69
00:06:56,421 --> 00:07:03,651
that have Ann Arbor has these kneeling busses that actually drop down so older adults don't have to step up to get on to the bus.

70
00:07:04,371 --> 00:07:09,200
Those are things that all can help people who, you know, who are losing their ability to drive,

71
00:07:09,201 --> 00:07:12,231
to continue to engage and participate in their communities.

72
00:07:14,151 --> 00:07:17,000
Obviously, health services is important, but also community supports.

73
00:07:17,001 --> 00:07:23,331
So things like Meals on Wheels, you know, other social services that can help people to age in place.

74
00:07:23,721 --> 00:07:26,991
And then finally, outdoor spaces and buildings, things.

75
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:32,600
There's a lot of documentation in this guide about the importance that older adults said they want

76
00:07:32,601 --> 00:07:38,691
to be able to walk outside on the sidewalks and have it be wide enough for two people to pass with.

77
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:44,151
Someone in a wheelchair can still navigate it places to stop and use the bathroom.

78
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:47,931
Older adults need to be able to use the bathroom more frequently than younger people.

79
00:07:48,111 --> 00:07:57,321
We don't have a lot of public restrooms throughout the community unless you're going in to use it in a in a business in Europe,

80
00:07:57,681 --> 00:08:00,261
which has a communities that are aging more quickly.

81
00:08:00,501 --> 00:08:06,191
There are many more public restrooms around that can actually older adults talk about this ability to, you know,

82
00:08:06,221 --> 00:08:11,690
if they want to go somewhere, they need to know that there's a bathroom along the way or a bench that they can rest on.

83
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:15,111
If they can't, you know, they know they're going to need to have an ability to stop.

84
00:08:16,821 --> 00:08:22,190
So the World Health Organization really built this and then some of the other more

85
00:08:22,191 --> 00:08:26,721
localized groups have taken those constructs and applied them in the US context.

86
00:08:27,441 --> 00:08:34,671
So this is the American Association of Retired Persons. It has kind of a stigma of being just kind of for old people.

87
00:08:35,411 --> 00:08:39,951
And it's, I think historically was more of a a resource,

88
00:08:39,951 --> 00:08:44,690
but it's now becoming it's actually a very active political organization that has a lot of political

89
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:50,331
leverage and is very powerful in terms of drawing attention to the needs of older adults.

90
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:55,221
It used to be considered that if you were a member of AARP, that you were old.

91
00:08:55,641 --> 00:09:01,641
It's now evolved into something much more in terms of a resource in a policy think tank with respect to aging.

92
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:05,811
So the AARP built this livability index,

93
00:09:06,501 --> 00:09:12,831
and it's derived from the same constructs that the World Health Organization identified in their Age Friendly Cities initiative.

94
00:09:13,731 --> 00:09:18,080
They also acknowledge other areas such as emergency preparedness and elder abuse.

95
00:09:18,081 --> 00:09:23,421
We talked last week about preventing financial abuse and fraud,

96
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:29,541
public safety and dementia friendly communities, which is something that's becoming increasingly important.

97
00:09:30,561 --> 00:09:36,141
Victoria just shared something with me this morning about something that she found about Singapore that's really just

98
00:09:36,351 --> 00:09:43,911
trying to design their communities to be navigable for people who are losing their ability to be cognitively engaged.

99
00:09:44,631 --> 00:09:47,791
And we'll get into that. More when we had the class on dimension.

100
00:09:48,301 --> 00:09:55,261
But from the from the air peace perspective livability is the ability to be independent,

101
00:09:55,771 --> 00:10:04,561
to remain safe in your homes and communities as you age and provide opportunities for engaging in civics, economic and social life.

102
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:11,011
So this index is slightly different in terms of what it does.

103
00:10:11,331 --> 00:10:15,451
We're going to I'm going to show you I'm going to take you to the page and we're going to spend a little time exploring it.

104
00:10:17,731 --> 00:10:22,801
It's really kind of a cool thing. You can plug in whatever address you want.

105
00:10:23,371 --> 00:10:26,821
We can do an arbor, so let's go into 48104.

106
00:10:30,221 --> 00:10:33,551
And so Ann Arbor has a livability score of 62.

107
00:10:33,581 --> 00:10:37,761
It ranges from 0 to 100. That's moderately high.

108
00:10:37,781 --> 00:10:41,231
It's quite high in terms of being a livable community.

109
00:10:41,771 --> 00:10:48,161
What do you think is the one community that the city that's got the highest livability index score in the United States?

110
00:10:54,361 --> 00:10:58,831
Near the city. New York City is pretty high. Do you know what it is?

111
00:10:58,841 --> 00:11:06,301
San Francisco. Wow. Has anybody ever lived in San Francisco or know it well enough to assess whether it's.

112
00:11:07,111 --> 00:11:10,861
What do you think about it only? It depends on the area.

113
00:11:11,011 --> 00:11:20,791
So if you're living like downtown and close to where I like the it's a big like a big tourist market that's like the nicest area.

114
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:25,891
And that's where like, well, like retired people live there, but they are all like, mm.

115
00:11:26,101 --> 00:11:30,000
Right. So, and it's hilly isn't it.

116
00:11:30,001 --> 00:11:36,541
Very crazy. But if you stay in that area here is like relatively flat.

117
00:11:37,711 --> 00:11:42,661
You can reach like all different kinds of plays. They have like little like grocery stores in town.

118
00:11:43,081 --> 00:11:46,711
So you don't want that kind of most of like people in San Francisco,

119
00:11:46,711 --> 00:11:51,450
they actually have like those like catering service that help them to do like groceries.

120
00:11:51,451 --> 00:11:55,741
They have like I said, you got to be a millionaire to live your entire life there.

121
00:11:57,391 --> 00:12:01,141
I would think that would be a big drawback in terms of being a livable city.

122
00:12:03,331 --> 00:12:09,181
But if you look at sort of what is involved in Ann Arbor score, you can go down and it provides the.

123
00:12:10,201 --> 00:12:19,871
Can you guys see I know what this I have to make this bigger. Is that better?

124
00:12:22,681 --> 00:12:31,531
You get one more? So and so in terms of an hour, how we do in this city, in terms of compared to the national average,

125
00:12:31,531 --> 00:12:38,791
our housing is around the average and the metrics for the housing are having zero step entrances.

126
00:12:39,451 --> 00:12:46,621
50% of the units in Ann Arbor housing units have a zero set entry, which means that you do not have to enter the house by going up steps.

127
00:12:46,981 --> 00:12:50,701
So steps are some of the greatest hazard for older adults. It's a tripping hazard.

128
00:12:50,851 --> 00:12:55,411
It's hard to climb steps when you start losing your strength, when you have any problems, when you have arthritis.

129
00:12:55,861 --> 00:12:59,521
If you are in a wheelchair, you cannot get into your house if you have a step.

130
00:12:59,581 --> 00:13:04,591
So zero safe entrances are very important. We have 50%, which is about the national average.

131
00:13:05,581 --> 00:13:13,471
Multifamily housing is apparently part of this as well. That's important in terms of being able to for caregiving, housing costs involved.

132
00:13:13,471 --> 00:13:20,491
So that's where I would think that San Francisco would be a problem in housing burden as well as availability of subsidized housing, housing.

133
00:13:20,881 --> 00:13:25,711
So we do not do very well on that that that particular part.

134
00:13:26,191 --> 00:13:30,751
We do have reasonably high metrics for transportation and the environment and health.

135
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:34,740
We don't we fall generally lowest on opportunity.

136
00:13:34,741 --> 00:13:42,961
And if you look at what's in opportunity, income inequality, we are around, you know,

137
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:47,941
halfway in that we are above the the US median for income inequality in the city.

138
00:13:48,841 --> 00:13:56,851
We have about the same number of jobs per person. We have a very high rate of high school graduation, which is opportunity metrics, I suppose.

139
00:13:57,241 --> 00:14:02,851
But we have relatively low age diversity,

140
00:14:02,911 --> 00:14:11,941
which is also something in terms of thinking about attitudes towards older adults sharing in the community potentially as well.

141
00:14:12,931 --> 00:14:16,321
So these are some things that are quite different in terms of what they're looking at

142
00:14:16,321 --> 00:14:20,851
compared to what the World Health Organization is having in its age friendly checklists.

143
00:14:21,751 --> 00:14:26,941
But it's something that is quite a bit of attention and it's a tool that's used quite a bit,

144
00:14:26,941 --> 00:14:32,291
just like the walkability index is to understand communities and where people are choosing to live.

145
00:14:32,311 --> 00:14:37,561
You know, they will they will locate in these different areas based on this index.

146
00:14:41,161 --> 00:14:49,881
Is that right? So Ann Arbor is actually was named one of the top two cities to live in the United States,

147
00:14:49,891 --> 00:14:54,750
not from the AARP livability index, but a different livability index,

148
00:14:54,751 --> 00:15:00,961
which is based on the realtors assessment of, you know, whether you can go tailgating,

149
00:15:00,961 --> 00:15:05,341
you can go canoeing there, you know, some providing more general life.

150
00:15:06,481 --> 00:15:12,841
But Ann Arbor does not engage in the in the AARP network with age friendly communities in Michigan.

151
00:15:12,851 --> 00:15:18,330
So this is a you can actually have your community be part of an assessed to be part of this

152
00:15:18,331 --> 00:15:23,731
age friendly community in Michigan as part of the AARP in Ann Arbor is not engaged in that,

153
00:15:25,081 --> 00:15:26,071
which is kind of interesting.

154
00:15:26,401 --> 00:15:32,911
They're not potentially interested in being identified as age friendly as opposed to just being one of the top cities to live in in the United States.

155
00:15:36,461 --> 00:15:43,721
But going back to the Jones Global Age Friendly Cities checklist, this is the category under outdoor spaces and buildings.

156
00:15:44,141 --> 00:15:49,180
And you can see that these are the kind of things that obviously can't be put into an index that's going to be on the Web,

157
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:51,821
that people can put their zip code in and come up with a score.

158
00:15:52,361 --> 00:15:57,731
The AARP Livability Index is really based on existing data that you can get about housing

159
00:15:57,731 --> 00:16:03,311
characteristics from the census or transportation from the transportation atlas.

160
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:06,481
It's not based on what is actually on the ground.

161
00:16:06,491 --> 00:16:12,671
There's not a lot of data that says whether you have sidewalks and green spaces, outdoor seating and pavements.

162
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:16,750
So that's something that's left out of the AARP index.

163
00:16:16,751 --> 00:16:22,211
And in fact, it's left out a lot of assessments of of aging in the age friendly places.

164
00:16:23,081 --> 00:16:27,941
But it's really an important part of what can keep an older adult independent in their community.

165
00:16:29,051 --> 00:16:36,971
And by this we mean the built environment. So it's how we build our cities, how we build our sidewalks, how we build our roads and our crossings.

166
00:16:37,691 --> 00:16:40,781
It's really the definition here comes from Health Canada,

167
00:16:41,081 --> 00:16:51,041
but it's all the building spaces and products that are created by people or modified by people that impact indoor and outdoor physical environments,

168
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:59,621
social environments and our health. So I this is my passion to understand the built environment.

169
00:17:00,251 --> 00:17:07,301
I've done, you know, invested a lot of my my time and my energy in my career looking at the role of the built environment for for aging.

170
00:17:08,081 --> 00:17:14,021
I was motivated to think about the built environment in the early 2000 when I left Toronto,

171
00:17:14,021 --> 00:17:17,651
where I grew up, and I went to North Carolina to do a postdoc.

172
00:17:17,651 --> 00:17:24,580
And I had been exposed to environments like this in Toronto with the crosswalks and

173
00:17:24,581 --> 00:17:30,371
sidewalks and the shelters with a place to sit and rest when it's cold and rainy.

174
00:17:31,691 --> 00:17:35,621
And I found myself in Durham, North Carolina, and I found this stuff.

175
00:17:36,491 --> 00:17:42,701
And not only is there not a place to rest or sit, if you're an older adult, there's no sidewalk.

176
00:17:43,261 --> 00:17:47,711
There is there's a a little bit of a curb cuts and you can get up and wait underneath there.

177
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:53,291
But it made me realize that it's actually really important how we build our communities for

178
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:57,910
the ability to allow for older adults to actually age in place when you're not able to drive.

179
00:17:57,911 --> 00:18:03,071
And many adults, older adults are unable to drive as they get older because they have trouble with vision,

180
00:18:03,821 --> 00:18:09,131
with, you know, just cognitive problems that don't allow them to be able to drive safely.

181
00:18:09,641 --> 00:18:13,691
And they also are more nervous driving as well. They're very afraid to drive at night.

182
00:18:14,411 --> 00:18:17,471
There's that there's just become more restrictive in terms of using a car.

183
00:18:17,891 --> 00:18:22,901
But in places in the United States that are so car dependent, it's hard to actually age in place.

184
00:18:23,981 --> 00:18:28,451
This is the road leading up to that bus stop. There's absolutely no place to walk.

185
00:18:29,021 --> 00:18:31,901
It's just hazardous. There's no sidewalk. There's not even much of a shoulder.

186
00:18:33,461 --> 00:18:39,461
When I came from North Carolina to Ann Arbor, things were a little bit better, but still not like what I was used to in Toronto.

187
00:18:40,271 --> 00:18:44,681
This is pictures that I took when I arrived here in the early 2000.

188
00:18:45,221 --> 00:18:51,221
This is the example where we have a sidewalk, which is fantastic, but it's not actually continuous,

189
00:18:51,221 --> 00:18:57,280
which means that it's it's it doesn't extend over here that if you're an older adult walking along on the sidewalk,

190
00:18:57,281 --> 00:19:04,331
you have to them navigate this rubble, this gravel, and then you have to kind of get through this whole area here.

191
00:19:05,531 --> 00:19:13,541
Older adults are very, very afraid of tripping because falling is actually one of the greatest risks for hip fractures and other other

192
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:21,401
problems that actually will be a catalyst for a sequence of decline and sequence of health decline and immobilization.

193
00:19:21,401 --> 00:19:28,421
And so this this isn't really you know, if you are an older adult, you get to this point and you look at this, you have two choices.

194
00:19:28,721 --> 00:19:35,701
You can kind of try to walk down here on this slope and go out on the road, or you can try and navigate this as best you can.

195
00:19:35,921 --> 00:19:42,641
I hope you don't trip. This is another example of what we call discontinuous sidewalk,

196
00:19:42,641 --> 00:19:48,761
where there is just stretches where sidewalks are in place, but they don't connect to other walkable sidewalks.

197
00:19:51,571 --> 00:19:54,871
Even the quality of sidewalks is important, even if through there.

198
00:19:54,901 --> 00:19:58,721
So this is an example of a sidewalk that is very hard to navigate.

199
00:19:58,741 --> 00:20:05,791
If you have someone with balance problems, arthritis, it's got a slope which is very challenging to navigate.

200
00:20:06,451 --> 00:20:16,171
It's got a lot of growth coming up in between the the pavement pieces and there's cracks and an uneven pavement along there as well.

201
00:20:18,661 --> 00:20:22,441
This is ideal. This is what we want. This would be so easy to walk along.

202
00:20:22,441 --> 00:20:25,830
If it's nice and level, there's no cracks. It's wide enough.

203
00:20:25,831 --> 00:20:30,151
So if you're in a wheelchair, you don't feel that you're going to be, you know, running out of room.

204
00:20:31,201 --> 00:20:36,001
You've also got this nice set back from the car, so you're not actually going to be at risk.

205
00:20:36,961 --> 00:20:40,561
Do you have a question? Do you look like, oh, no, that wasn't Hungary.

206
00:20:40,951 --> 00:20:46,771
Yes. And which is like a student. It's like relative to a building that where students live, not older folks.

207
00:20:47,281 --> 00:20:50,461
Right. That's it. That's a good point.

208
00:20:50,581 --> 00:20:57,471
So it's built for students. And then when I also arrived in Ann Arbor, there were these curb cuts.

209
00:20:58,251 --> 00:21:07,171
You don't see these anymore. I, I tell you a reason why. But so this is really typical in terms of how sidewalks were built in urban areas.

210
00:21:07,191 --> 00:21:10,911
So a sidewalk comes along and then you get to the curb and then you step off the curb.

211
00:21:12,621 --> 00:21:15,711
There's two problems with this curb for older adults.

212
00:21:15,921 --> 00:21:22,261
What are they? Easily transition the street.

213
00:21:22,411 --> 00:21:28,591
Exactly. Exactly. And so for people, if you are in a wheelchair, are you some kind of a wheeled device?

214
00:21:28,921 --> 00:21:32,611
It's very difficult. You cannot get off this curve. You're basically stuck here.

215
00:21:32,611 --> 00:21:35,701
You can't cross the street if you.

216
00:21:35,851 --> 00:21:41,071
We've done focus groups with older adults and they cannot step off a curb.

217
00:21:41,671 --> 00:21:48,091
So if they if they get to a point where there is not a curb, there's no there's a curb there.

218
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:52,801
They don't have the balance and stability to take that step down.

219
00:21:53,641 --> 00:21:58,051
And so what older adults will do if they discover that there's a curb,

220
00:21:58,381 --> 00:22:07,951
they'll find some place along the street here where there's a car so they can hold onto the car, step off the curb, and then walk in the street.

221
00:22:08,521 --> 00:22:10,531
So, again, putting themselves at risk that way.

222
00:22:12,181 --> 00:22:18,451
The Ann Arbor Center for Independent Living, which is an organization that supports people with disabilities,

223
00:22:19,051 --> 00:22:26,940
sued the city of Ann Arbor in the early 2000 for not being compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of making

224
00:22:26,941 --> 00:22:34,791
communities accessible so that Ann Arbor went around and put curb cuts in all of their all throughout the city.

225
00:22:35,831 --> 00:22:41,471
So now we have them. But it took a lawsuit for the city of Alberta to do that.

226
00:22:41,801 --> 00:22:46,241
Yeah, that's funny, because they just did this on my street, but it's 20 years after we're talking about.

227
00:22:46,301 --> 00:22:49,901
So they were curves there before. Yeah, right. And so they just made em all.

228
00:22:50,021 --> 00:22:53,381
They had to redo all my sidewalks in my house, but to make it.

229
00:22:54,071 --> 00:22:57,071
But I didn't know it took that long to. Wow.

230
00:22:57,131 --> 00:23:00,561
I didn't realize they were still curves in all. They're all over my street.

231
00:23:00,581 --> 00:23:03,611
Maybe anybody else have curves where they live.

232
00:23:07,001 --> 00:23:10,321
I think we don't even realize it. We just, like, press it over, you know?

233
00:23:10,941 --> 00:23:15,121
Yeah. Yeah. Who filed the lawsuit?

234
00:23:15,631 --> 00:23:23,551
It's the Ann Arbor Center for Independent Living. So there's these Seattle Center for Independent Living across the United States.

235
00:23:23,551 --> 00:23:28,141
And they're in different communities and they're a resource and an advocacy group for people with disabilities.

236
00:23:29,071 --> 00:23:32,851
What year was it? That must have been like 2006 or so.

237
00:23:33,121 --> 00:23:48,271
It was a while ago. Yeah, I think in place. So this is, you know, the new version of Curves and Crossings.

238
00:23:49,231 --> 00:23:54,420
So this is a curve cut where it's got this slope here. So if you you know, you don't have to worry about stuff.

239
00:23:54,421 --> 00:23:59,581
You might have a crude a curve or you have any you know, you have a wheelchair you can roll off easily.

240
00:24:00,331 --> 00:24:06,041
Does anybody know what these red things are for? So for people who are visually impaired.

241
00:24:06,851 --> 00:24:10,301
Yes. Yes. So they would go by different names.

242
00:24:10,691 --> 00:24:14,311
In England, they're called tactile pavement, which is what I use.

243
00:24:14,321 --> 00:24:19,761
I'm not sure what the U.S. calls them exactly, but they are for people who have.

244
00:24:19,781 --> 00:24:23,771
So they're they're a different color and they have raised bumps on them.

245
00:24:23,781 --> 00:24:29,771
Right. And so this is an ADA compliant curb crossing corner.

246
00:24:30,191 --> 00:24:34,751
It is. It has the curb cut. It has the raised tactile pavement.

247
00:24:35,081 --> 00:24:42,731
So people who are visually impaired, if they have a white cane or even if they just can't see so well, they'll see that different color.

248
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:48,401
And they're know that they're approaching a curb, a crossing. And to be careful that they don't want to just step out into the street.

249
00:24:50,981 --> 00:24:58,391
Some older adults, if they don't have vision impairment or when they do find these to be a tripping hazard,

250
00:24:58,871 --> 00:25:02,441
those bumps can actually are very difficult to navigate.

251
00:25:02,471 --> 00:25:07,991
And many people who actually use wheelchairs find this to be really unsettling and unstable as they're going.

252
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:13,691
So they will go around this and they kind of get off the curb in an area where it's actually not flat.

253
00:25:15,741 --> 00:25:19,921
Then writing them down the how can they go round and.

254
00:25:21,891 --> 00:25:25,401
Exactly. Exactly. Yeah, it's very challenging.

255
00:25:27,351 --> 00:25:33,301
So that means that, you know, this idea of universal design isn't actually universal,

256
00:25:33,321 --> 00:25:36,981
that there are different features that work for different people with different needs.

257
00:25:38,511 --> 00:25:42,531
In any case, it's better than a curve. Right. Let's see.

258
00:25:42,621 --> 00:25:50,180
I guess I don't know how often other people might have seen this or heard this, but when I was in Topeka, it was really cool.

259
00:25:50,181 --> 00:26:00,651
Like they had like a a hearing aid to at crosswalks where it like said stop or go and then it would count down at the crosswalk.

260
00:26:00,651 --> 00:26:07,220
And I thought that was really great. Yes. You know, it is true.

261
00:26:07,221 --> 00:26:12,891
And then if we we have that as well in Ann Arbor and different places where it'll have little

262
00:26:13,191 --> 00:26:17,601
the visual sign will tell you how much time you have left and then there's can be an audio.

263
00:26:17,931 --> 00:26:21,021
But I don't think there's audio in Ann Arbor is there.

264
00:26:21,441 --> 00:26:27,891
There's not I that countdowns are great. I've seen those but not I think in Ann Arbor it's just a beep that changes when it's yeah.

265
00:26:28,191 --> 00:26:32,871
And so that you know that it's it gives you more stability and security and crossing.

266
00:26:33,411 --> 00:26:39,591
There has been a lot of literature saying that there's not enough time for old people to to process the crosswalks,

267
00:26:39,591 --> 00:26:44,211
that there's not a long enough time to actually cross that.

268
00:26:44,211 --> 00:26:48,561
So that's a whole another issue as well. I'm thinking about it. Victoria,

269
00:26:49,131 --> 00:26:54,591
I saw you today and Bloomberg City Lab that Hong Kong has installed lights

270
00:26:54,651 --> 00:26:59,211
where the road bumps are so that when people are looking down at their phone,

271
00:26:59,601 --> 00:27:05,601
they don't walk into the street. So it'll be red when you're not supposed to go and then green when you can't go.

272
00:27:05,601 --> 00:27:10,131
Which, which is interesting. Um, I know there's a concept in design.

273
00:27:10,521 --> 00:27:13,551
Um, I can't remember the term one. It has benefits for everyone.

274
00:27:13,911 --> 00:27:18,291
And so I can see that having maybe paired with like a hearing implement or something like that,

275
00:27:18,291 --> 00:27:22,761
or you have this combination of light so there's no physical barrier.

276
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:27,421
And then also the hearing that keeps people are hearing like a second person.

277
00:27:28,071 --> 00:27:31,190
So yeah, that is interesting. It's true.

278
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:33,891
You know, you think about it, people walking around looking at their phones all the time,

279
00:27:33,891 --> 00:27:37,040
they're just at risk of it, you know, going into the car with someone else.

280
00:27:37,041 --> 00:27:42,921
And so this is a mechanism to help that. It's also great for for parents with small children in strollers.

281
00:27:43,381 --> 00:27:47,540
Right. It's just easier to roll a stroller than it is to kind of try and get it up over the curb.

282
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:55,131
So it's, you know, as Victoria was saying, that some of these changes are good, in fact, for the whole community, not just for older people.

283
00:28:00,121 --> 00:28:05,681
This is something that else was very interesting. So Detroit was trying to be compliant as well.

284
00:28:05,721 --> 00:28:09,170
It had been sued to put in curb cuts at their crossing.

285
00:28:09,171 --> 00:28:15,441
So they put curb cuts in. But of course, they're completely useless if there's no if there's no sidewalk that can get you anywhere.

286
00:28:17,871 --> 00:28:22,321
So there's been a tremendous amount of work that's actually evolved since I would say, you know,

287
00:28:22,371 --> 00:28:29,781
the early 2000s really documenting and examining these important features of the local built environment and how they shape health.

288
00:28:30,711 --> 00:28:35,481
So data show that uneven sidewalks, which I talked about, that's kind of, you know,

289
00:28:35,491 --> 00:28:43,281
not not smooth and sidewalk obstacles, things like parking meters, tree roots.

290
00:28:43,281 --> 00:28:50,481
So they'll often be routes that will come up and push the sidewalks up, as well as loose rocks and stones.

291
00:28:50,811 --> 00:28:55,071
They're responsible for the vast majority of outdoor falls among older adults.

292
00:28:55,521 --> 00:29:03,441
So high risk older adults in some qualitative work by Amy Gallagher show that they were say

293
00:29:03,441 --> 00:29:07,881
that safety from crime is important as well as positive sidewalk and traffic conditions,

294
00:29:08,331 --> 00:29:14,781
public walking tracks and trails and fair weather that encourages just engaging in physical activity, going out to walk.

295
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:19,851
So walking is the most common form of physical activity in older adults.

296
00:29:20,541 --> 00:29:25,461
That is, that becomes the most accessible way to maintain physical activity.

297
00:29:25,881 --> 00:29:32,541
If you can't walk outside in your neighborhood, it becomes more and more difficult to maintain that part of that aspect of physical activity.

298
00:29:34,041 --> 00:29:42,350
Older adults in areas like Michigan will often go to malls to walk, so they'll be like walking clubs for older people in malls.

299
00:29:42,351 --> 00:29:47,541
And that can be a safer place to walk than it is to be walking outside of your home.

300
00:29:51,741 --> 00:29:56,691
Some work from England shows that older adults who live in environments that make it easy for them to go outside,

301
00:29:56,961 --> 00:30:03,981
they're more likely to be physically active, to be enjoy life satisfaction, and to achieve the recommended levels of healthy walking.

302
00:30:05,391 --> 00:30:11,541
Again, poor quality environments are especially hazardous for people who have vision, mobility or other impairments.

303
00:30:12,471 --> 00:30:18,080
And then some interesting work by from some fantastic work in Finland that's going

304
00:30:18,081 --> 00:30:22,521
on is that compared to people who are independent in their ability to move,

305
00:30:22,881 --> 00:30:28,881
those who have lower extremity impairments due to balance problems for arthritis, just avoid grassy terrain.

306
00:30:29,001 --> 00:30:31,181
So they will if they have to get somewhere new,

307
00:30:31,491 --> 00:30:38,871
they will do whatever it takes to kind of avoid any area that's got grass on it because it's very difficult to walk stably and safely on grass.

308
00:30:42,921 --> 00:30:45,561
So how do we even document these things?

309
00:30:45,781 --> 00:30:52,311
They're out there, but they're not easy necessarily to document and measure for purposes of research and understanding their impact on health.

310
00:30:53,451 --> 00:31:00,321
So there's typically what's done on these kind of neighborhood audits, as anyone ever done a neighborhood audit used any kind of audit tools.

311
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:06,471
You've done it, Victoria. Not even formally,

312
00:31:06,471 --> 00:31:17,151
but when I was in the architecture and urban design industry and one of the jobs that summer intern design projects was assessing a area of Cambridge,

313
00:31:17,151 --> 00:31:27,230
Massachusetts that is a public transit other and how neighborhood residents who are also have been disenfranchized and historically

314
00:31:27,231 --> 00:31:37,711
oppressed are left out of navigator access to Boston and how they get to like the one grocery store that sort of in this area.

315
00:31:37,731 --> 00:31:42,561
So it was more from like a design like sort of a checklist matrix.

316
00:31:42,801 --> 00:31:46,101
So something similar to yeah, just like, you know, documenting a checklist.

317
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:51,201
Exactly. So there's quite a few of these different audit instruments that are developed.

318
00:31:52,581 --> 00:31:59,301
But before we get to that, I want to tell you about this particular method of actually doing an audit, which is called systematic social observation.

319
00:31:59,841 --> 00:32:02,511
This is a method that came out of a sociology literature.

320
00:32:02,511 --> 00:32:11,750
And in the late nineties it was developed actually for a project in Chicago, which was quite a famous project,

321
00:32:11,751 --> 00:32:16,401
but they were one of the first studies to really think about the role of neighborhoods for health,

322
00:32:16,401 --> 00:32:21,111
and they were actually interested in looking more at younger, younger adult health and mental health.

323
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:30,500
And they it's a direct observational method. So again, you're out there in person looking at the environment and it's it's a method that's done that.

324
00:32:30,501 --> 00:32:38,211
They did it actually by driving down the streets in Chicago with a video camera and videotaping both sides

325
00:32:38,211 --> 00:32:44,961
of the streets and then going through those videotapes afterwards and using a checklist to document,

326
00:32:45,291 --> 00:32:46,821
you know, the continuous sidewalks.

327
00:32:47,181 --> 00:32:54,171
What was the quality of the sidewalks, evidence of violence and graffiti, you know, other markers of social disorder.

328
00:32:56,001 --> 00:33:00,501
But we also implemented it here in a study that was undertaken in the early 2000.

329
00:33:01,191 --> 00:33:07,551
It was done in Chicago, but the site location was at ESR and it was done using an interviewer.

330
00:33:07,551 --> 00:33:14,271
So it capitalized on the fact that interviewers were going into the home in Chicago, so they were interviewing older adults.

331
00:33:14,781 --> 00:33:17,901
This is a study. It's called the Chicago Community Adult Health Study.

332
00:33:18,231 --> 00:33:22,131
It was conducted in the early 2000. It's an old study.

333
00:33:22,431 --> 00:33:26,391
You can still access the data though through ICP. Sorry, but the link over here,

334
00:33:27,741 --> 00:33:35,811
it's about 3000 individuals that were interviewed over the age of 18 and there's about 1200 of those who are over the age of 45.

335
00:33:36,561 --> 00:33:44,180
It's all data, but it is amazing. They have so much data on neighborhoods and on health and they have blood collection as well.

336
00:33:44,181 --> 00:33:47,330
So there's biomarkers. So a lot of people actually still use this data.

337
00:33:47,331 --> 00:33:52,311
So I know Maggie Harkin has published extensively on it and continues to use it.

338
00:33:52,971 --> 00:34:00,530
So it's a fun dataset. But what was interesting is that they did this, they did the elected a lot of data about the neighborhood,

339
00:34:00,531 --> 00:34:06,831
but they did this systematic social observation of the block around which participants were living.

340
00:34:07,341 --> 00:34:15,021
So this was a face to face interview. Got an interviewer going into people's homes to give them and ask them survey questions,

341
00:34:15,621 --> 00:34:22,911
take some hypertension, high blood pressure, high pressure metrics, ask them all sorts of other questions.

342
00:34:24,381 --> 00:34:31,490
But before they went into their homes, they were instructed to walk around all four streets around where that person was

343
00:34:31,491 --> 00:34:36,231
living and document characteristics according to the standardized instrument.

344
00:34:37,941 --> 00:34:44,061
For example, they were asked about the four streets around on that block, talking about the volume of traffic,

345
00:34:44,601 --> 00:34:48,981
what is the condition of the street in terms of very poor or under construction?

346
00:34:49,551 --> 00:34:53,751
How noisy is the street? Are there any people visible on the street?

347
00:34:54,211 --> 00:34:56,691
Bunch of things. There was a lot of lot of things that they collected.

348
00:34:59,381 --> 00:35:05,891
So when I came to Iceland, this was one of the studies that had just been collected and there was so much new data that was coming out from it.

349
00:35:05,891 --> 00:35:11,351
So I thought, this is a really great opportunity to look at what is the role of the built environment for health.

350
00:35:12,131 --> 00:35:14,651
I zoned in on this particular question, which is, you know,

351
00:35:14,711 --> 00:35:20,261
from the instrument I just showed you on asking the interviewers to document the condition of the street.

352
00:35:21,101 --> 00:35:28,601
So obviously this would be an example of a street where there are many sizable cracks, potholes and broken curbs.

353
00:35:29,921 --> 00:35:35,441
If you, again, are an older adult trying to navigate this, this is extremely hazardous in terms of a tripping hazard.

354
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:44,681
My mother on her scooter in Toronto encountered something like this on the streets and her scooter actually tipped over.

355
00:35:45,341 --> 00:35:54,461
So these are really hazardous conditions. And so we took this measure and then said, how does this relate to the health of people in this survey?

356
00:35:55,331 --> 00:36:01,451
We found that older adults who were who had arthritis or underlying impairments living in an

357
00:36:01,451 --> 00:36:07,751
area with these kind of conditions were more likely had a fourfold higher odds of reporting,

358
00:36:08,201 --> 00:36:13,121
mobility, disability, so unable to walk several blocks or just unable to get out and about.

359
00:36:14,861 --> 00:36:25,061
We also found that people living in these areas with more streets, if they have some underlying mobility difficulty, far less likely to vote.

360
00:36:27,261 --> 00:36:31,911
So really restricting ability to engage in civic life.

361
00:36:33,841 --> 00:36:39,061
It appears here that people who don't have difficulty with underlying movement and arthritis and balance,

362
00:36:40,081 --> 00:36:43,231
that they are in fact more likely to vote in poorer street conditions.

363
00:36:43,231 --> 00:36:48,571
But this difference is not significant since the play significant. This was the one that was it was was notable.

364
00:36:53,351 --> 00:37:00,101
So there are a number of these different instruments that can be used to document the features of the environment.

365
00:37:00,911 --> 00:37:04,511
I encourage you to go to the Active Living Research site. They have a lot of them there.

366
00:37:05,291 --> 00:37:09,761
One of the ones I've used extensively is the senior water walking environment assessment tool.

367
00:37:10,271 --> 00:37:17,111
We talked about this language of senior not being a really good word to be using for talking about older adults.

368
00:37:17,111 --> 00:37:24,941
But this is the instrument that was developed by Yvonne Michael in the mid to late early 2000 and it's called The Sweat,

369
00:37:25,811 --> 00:37:32,500
and he documents different aspects of the neighborhood environment in terms of features that are important for older adults,

370
00:37:32,501 --> 00:37:36,971
in terms of types of buildings and sidewalks we should just talked about,

371
00:37:37,481 --> 00:37:46,000
but also aspects of safety in terms of adequate lighting and traffic safety and in terms of the volume of traffic and speed and

372
00:37:46,001 --> 00:37:53,891
esthetic items as well as destinations where people can actually go to and access transportation and parking in the neighborhood.

373
00:37:55,781 --> 00:38:00,251
So these are just some of the examples of the kind of questions that are asked on this instrument.

374
00:38:00,581 --> 00:38:07,541
And basically, you, you know, you're sitting there, you've got a segment of a street that you're looking at and you determine,

375
00:38:07,751 --> 00:38:12,851
you know, what are the traffic up at the crossings like? Is there a pedestrian crossing signal?

376
00:38:13,241 --> 00:38:18,971
Is it a pedestrian access signals or do you press a button and you know that you can actually you're going

377
00:38:18,971 --> 00:38:25,751
to be getting a signal that's going to guide you across the street at the time of the traffic signal.

378
00:38:25,871 --> 00:38:29,981
How long is it takes and when and how much time does someone have to cross the street?

379
00:38:31,301 --> 00:38:34,541
Again, that's sort of our sidewalks present. Are they continuous?

380
00:38:34,661 --> 00:38:39,131
What's the quality of them? And again, are there abstractions on there?

381
00:38:40,421 --> 00:38:44,021
Then they have an extensive measures about curb cuts as well.

382
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:47,891
In terms of the are those bumps there? Is the color contrast there?

383
00:38:48,671 --> 00:38:54,581
Do they have these white apron, chrome curb cuts? Which are these more like more secure areas to actually cross?

384
00:38:57,551 --> 00:38:59,290
And one of the things that we did,

385
00:38:59,291 --> 00:39:05,711
we used this instrument actually in a number of studies in person and in Michigan and right outside campus, actually.

386
00:39:06,401 --> 00:39:10,901
But it's incredibly time consuming. Right? These things are very time consuming and systematic.

387
00:39:10,901 --> 00:39:14,291
Social observation is time consuming to kind of be doing this and walking around.

388
00:39:15,551 --> 00:39:21,941
And so you can get around some of the time constraints by using a virtual audit, by doing this audit through Google Street View.

389
00:39:22,541 --> 00:39:26,471
We did some reliability assessment comparing the systematic social observation in

390
00:39:26,471 --> 00:39:31,630
Chicago with an equivalent instrument using Google Street View at the same time,

391
00:39:31,631 --> 00:39:35,710
and found that a lot of the structural features of the environment can be reliably

392
00:39:35,711 --> 00:39:40,781
accessed through Google Street View at a fraction of the cost of the in-person audit.

393
00:39:41,561 --> 00:39:45,901
Some of the things that don't get assessed very well through Google Street View are those things that are transient.

394
00:39:45,911 --> 00:39:49,301
So litter and rubble on the streets.

395
00:39:51,041 --> 00:39:57,101
Obviously, you can't assess things like the number of people on the street or it's difficult to assess traffic volume,

396
00:39:57,671 --> 00:40:08,641
but it can give you an idea of the structures of that community. And so we did this with a lot of different work with traffic volume.

397
00:40:08,651 --> 00:40:11,951
Is there is it what's the concern of traffic volume?

398
00:40:12,761 --> 00:40:21,011
So the more so there's a number of different things. So if there's a lot of cars, usually it can mean also there's two lanes of traffic,

399
00:40:21,011 --> 00:40:25,301
which means it's harder to get across if because you've got more space to actually cover.

400
00:40:25,991 --> 00:40:34,721
More vehicles also can be a source of noise, and they can also be just more frightening for older adults who are just trying to,

401
00:40:35,261 --> 00:40:39,401
you know, get down there, even on the sidewalk, that there's a lot of cars going by.

402
00:40:39,401 --> 00:40:46,121
It can be unnerving to to just feel safe in terms of the volume of vehicles going.

403
00:40:46,751 --> 00:40:50,621
So but also like large volume is associated with like decreased speed.

404
00:40:51,221 --> 00:40:54,431
Like in New York City is going that fast because there are just like so many cars.

405
00:40:55,431 --> 00:40:59,571
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think that actually is a a good point.

406
00:40:59,571 --> 00:41:03,761
And thinking about the context in which that volume and the speed at which that volume is moving.

407
00:41:04,781 --> 00:41:14,961
Yeah. So if we I'm going to show you a neat little example about what this looks like to do a neighborhood audit through Google Street View.

408
00:41:16,251 --> 00:41:26,121
And so we'll go in and do this, you know, through just jumping outside the door where we are doing it remotely through Google Street View.

409
00:41:27,081 --> 00:41:36,441
So we'll get our little person over here and we go over to the School of Public Health and we'll drop down right in front of where we are right now.

410
00:41:37,941 --> 00:41:42,201
So you'll notice a few things. What's the date of this?

411
00:41:42,831 --> 00:41:49,431
It's June 20, 21. So Google Street View has this thing called the time machine up in the corner,

412
00:41:50,271 --> 00:41:57,651
which you can actually then drop down and see different years at which those images were collected.

413
00:41:58,491 --> 00:42:02,511
So you can even go back to October 27 and see what this looked like.

414
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:06,531
Obviously, a lot of construction going on in the street there.

415
00:42:08,751 --> 00:42:16,761
But if we then, you know, pop back up to 2021 here and let's take a little walk and sort of see what it looks like.

416
00:42:18,111 --> 00:42:24,080
If we move along over here, we can assess, you know, it's pretty easy to assess those crossings, right?

417
00:42:24,081 --> 00:42:27,351
We can see what with the crossing is like.

418
00:42:27,351 --> 00:42:31,221
We can see the curb cuts. We can see the pedestrian signals.

419
00:42:31,851 --> 00:42:36,351
There's a tool in Google Street view that will allow you to measure distance so you can sort

420
00:42:36,351 --> 00:42:43,551
of actually document and measure the length of that crosswalk in terms of how many feet it is.

421
00:42:46,221 --> 00:42:50,061
And then we're going to just go a little bit over here and have a look at this particular crosswalk.

422
00:42:51,841 --> 00:42:59,481
And you'll notice as you get over here, we'll take you further back out of here.

423
00:43:04,631 --> 00:43:12,641
We're going to this is June 2021, and we're going to go right over here and go right up to the curbside.

424
00:43:13,211 --> 00:43:16,391
And now we're in September 2014.

425
00:43:16,601 --> 00:43:22,301
If you look up in the corner and that's a very different crosswalk than it was.

426
00:43:22,901 --> 00:43:27,401
So they've changed this crosswalk and this turn.

427
00:43:28,301 --> 00:43:32,711
So it is now what it used to be was, in fact, a turning lane here.

428
00:43:33,461 --> 00:43:37,091
And then the street went straight this way, so it bisected them.

429
00:43:38,381 --> 00:43:44,080
And the crosswalk was, you know, two parts. One, getting to this little island and then walking along.

430
00:43:44,081 --> 00:43:47,831
And it's nice. There's no curb here, so it's just straight. The curve is on either side.

431
00:43:47,831 --> 00:43:56,531
It's pretty easy to get across. And then you cross again here. I don't know anything about design, but I was wondering like, why did they change this?

432
00:43:56,891 --> 00:44:03,431
What's what's better about what we have now compared to what this is than.

433
00:44:06,351 --> 00:44:11,760
What do you think, Leslie? I don't know, because I feel like this would be a little safer for people who might have breathing issues,

434
00:44:11,761 --> 00:44:15,831
and that might need a break to get across like a longer pulse. Yeah, me too.

435
00:44:17,811 --> 00:44:21,171
Victoria. Ideas. And looks like they made it easier to turn left.

436
00:44:22,371 --> 00:44:29,961
Make it easier from an observatory on to this one where there's no really clear direction where cars can turn left from here.

437
00:44:30,351 --> 00:44:37,131
So it looks like it's one way. Oh, wow. Um, and then this is like a right turn with other thing.

438
00:44:37,131 --> 00:44:45,770
Anything from personal experience riding my bike around and our people fly through right turn lanes, and I've almost been here like one.

439
00:44:45,771 --> 00:44:53,361
It's like my ride away or when it's pedestrian or something like that. So maybe it is a preventive measure because some people aren't just assuming

440
00:44:53,361 --> 00:44:56,811
that they can if they're in the right way and they just like here on the right.

441
00:44:57,271 --> 00:45:05,781
Right. Um, anyway, I thought that was interesting that it has changed, but also you can start seeing that,

442
00:45:06,111 --> 00:45:10,281
you know, the streets here are not in their best condition, although the crosswalks are reasonably good.

443
00:45:11,031 --> 00:45:11,270
All right.

444
00:45:11,271 --> 00:45:16,381
So say you're you're walking and you're going down the cardiovascular center and you've got an appointment down there and you're heading down.

445
00:45:16,941 --> 00:45:21,471
You can document, you know, the, um, the public transit stop here.

446
00:45:21,801 --> 00:45:28,011
There's a bench, it's covered. There's some definitely have a good crossing here with the curb cuts.

447
00:45:29,451 --> 00:45:35,240
You know, we can walk a little bit further along here and then if we head down this way,

448
00:45:35,241 --> 00:45:39,441
this is an interesting area that I have been kind of curious about.

449
00:45:41,291 --> 00:45:53,860
It's good to be around. I've had a lot of students work with me over the years and do this work and it's quite time consuming.

450
00:45:53,861 --> 00:46:03,111
But you do can you can definitely get there. This area also is a little wonky in terms of crossing.

451
00:46:03,191 --> 00:46:11,651
It's a bit rough in terms of the crossing and the you can see here that the red coloring is actually kind of disappearing.

452
00:46:11,981 --> 00:46:13,611
So that's a little bit more hazardous.

453
00:46:14,441 --> 00:46:22,151
And then we get down to this intersection, which is just further along here close to the MIT, the medical library.

454
00:46:22,451 --> 00:46:31,721
And I find personally walking on this this crossing to be challenging because it is really run down.

455
00:46:32,471 --> 00:46:36,971
The quality here is, you know, is just really there's a lot of rough pavement.

456
00:46:38,441 --> 00:46:40,361
The the curb cuts here.

457
00:46:40,361 --> 00:46:47,471
You can see that someone has actually put a big question mark right here next to this section of the pavement because it's falling apart.

458
00:46:47,831 --> 00:46:52,301
So these are tripping hazards. It's also a slope that's coming down, so it's hard to navigate.

459
00:46:53,411 --> 00:46:57,761
So anyway, it's just interesting. You can actually see quite a bit on Google Street View.

460
00:46:57,761 --> 00:47:04,511
And if you use an audit instrument, you can you can actually then just pretend that you're outside and document

461
00:47:04,511 --> 00:47:08,531
these things and then you can line up if you're interested in a particular time,

462
00:47:08,531 --> 00:47:14,170
you can line up, you know, use the Google Street View historic time machine to light it up with whatever survey data you have.

463
00:47:14,171 --> 00:47:20,111
And individuals are curious about the role in Michigan in general,

464
00:47:20,411 --> 00:47:26,651
they have constructions every year, but why are there always cracks appearing every year?

465
00:47:26,781 --> 00:47:28,451
Because of the windows cold.

466
00:47:30,661 --> 00:47:37,171
So I would love to know the answer to your question why there's so much construction and volumes of construction everywhere.

467
00:47:37,531 --> 00:47:41,371
And and why doesn't it actually make a whole lot of difference?

468
00:47:41,371 --> 00:47:45,330
And I it maybe it's the cold and the salt. Yeah.

469
00:47:45,331 --> 00:47:49,951
And then I was like, my wife is living down in Columbus, Ohio.

470
00:47:50,281 --> 00:47:57,511
So every time I travel down, I know when I reached the border of Columbus,

471
00:47:57,691 --> 00:48:05,451
of Ohio and Michigan, the sound that I hear inside of my car immediately changed it.

472
00:48:05,501 --> 00:48:14,321
It was much quieter in Ohio. So it's just like literally a feet away.

473
00:48:14,341 --> 00:48:17,341
The differences of weather. All eyes on this thing.

474
00:48:18,121 --> 00:48:24,360
I don't understand, you know, any reason? I've always heard that it's the salt that makes our streets.

475
00:48:24,361 --> 00:48:30,660
Like we don't just have a light. It's not like salt. No longevity on us, you know, because of how strong that they have to be.

476
00:48:30,661 --> 00:48:35,451
And the cold weather makes it all crap. She's a little bit colder.

477
00:48:35,451 --> 00:48:42,321
And, you know, Michigan is like doing wild like the band into like making the road kind of like drivable in wintertime.

478
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:45,201
But that's like a sacrifice in some world condition.

479
00:48:45,741 --> 00:48:52,881
So like in Colorado, you know, it's like the neighborhood streets are way better than like the Michigan Ann Arbor, at least.

480
00:48:53,631 --> 00:49:01,551
But in the wintertime, it's not very at all. Yeah, that's actually what Governor Whitmer ran on in the streets here.

481
00:49:02,241 --> 00:49:06,471
And she's still running on the streets and she did that.

482
00:49:06,471 --> 00:49:14,061
Everybody thinks those damn streets are set tomorrow, but it's like everybody got money back in insurance money because it's like a

483
00:49:14,061 --> 00:49:19,861
compensation for the fact that the streets and that's why all the construction right now.

484
00:49:19,881 --> 00:49:21,500
Yeah. There's a good amount of funding that.

485
00:49:21,501 --> 00:49:28,071
Well, my dad works for construction and there's some good jobs that went out this year for that, you know, making a difference.

486
00:49:30,971 --> 00:49:38,381
Can you actually see the city if, like your car or your moral psycho is damaged by hitting a pothole here?

487
00:49:38,861 --> 00:49:43,671
Because in San Diego, you can do that. Yeah, you can do the city.

488
00:49:43,721 --> 00:49:52,781
Can you even just do that? Right. To take it to them. You tell them I well breaks because of the roads and I fix it in 500 bucks.

489
00:49:52,871 --> 00:49:56,590
You got to give it to me back. I think that's a great idea because that happens.

490
00:49:56,591 --> 00:50:02,051
That happened to me. You got a flat tire just from hitting a pothole to the city.

491
00:50:02,061 --> 00:50:05,681
So we don't have any record and then we don't have to. But we should do that.

492
00:50:06,761 --> 00:50:10,481
They actually have like a funding because they were sued by,

493
00:50:10,721 --> 00:50:21,071
I think somebody before a years ago and I'm sure like the repair store and now to the court and testify saying that this is by like a pothole here.

494
00:50:22,541 --> 00:50:25,921
The potholes in Michigan are like astronomical.

495
00:50:25,961 --> 00:50:29,631
They are huge by by February. Right.

496
00:50:29,651 --> 00:50:34,451
I mean, there's just like an abyss to be so careful when you're driving stuff.

497
00:50:34,991 --> 00:50:38,921
All right. I just want you to have a sort of quick look at how that method actually involves.

498
00:50:40,451 --> 00:50:46,931
And then as you were deciding what about the weather and Google Street view, did we see any snow?

499
00:50:47,741 --> 00:50:54,521
No snow. I have seen some actually more recently that they're actually including the weather.

500
00:50:54,521 --> 00:50:59,891
But if you're doing a neighborhood audit of a place and it has is you know, it may have, in fact,

501
00:50:59,891 --> 00:51:04,841
great sidewalks, but if they are impassable because of the weather, then it's completely different story.

502
00:51:05,201 --> 00:51:11,561
And in fact, weather is a really, really important factor for influencing mobility and participation and all you as adults.

503
00:51:11,561 --> 00:51:17,290
And this is a study that we did, adding a question to the University of Michigan's Consumer Survey of consumers

504
00:51:17,291 --> 00:51:21,521
just asking about asking older adults about their challenges with weather.

505
00:51:21,761 --> 00:51:27,521
The biggest challenge for them is icy conditions, particularly just leaving home and driving.

506
00:51:27,671 --> 00:51:31,331
So that's that's really the greatest perceived risk.

507
00:51:33,521 --> 00:51:38,891
So I'm just going to show you this paper and just kind of walk you through some of the methods that we used in it in terms of

508
00:51:38,891 --> 00:51:47,471
understanding how to use this Google Street View audit to recognize and see how vulnerable older adults are aging in place in Detroit.

509
00:51:48,281 --> 00:51:58,691
So the purpose was to look at sort of longitudinal trajectories of outdoor mobility in this sample of, as I say, vulnerable older adults in Detroit.

510
00:51:59,111 --> 00:52:05,861
The dataset is this amazing dataset, which I think is no longer available at Michigan, but it's the Michigan minimum dataset for home care.

511
00:52:05,861 --> 00:52:13,571
So this is this is a administrative database in that it is people who are in Michigan who have chosen

512
00:52:13,811 --> 00:52:18,971
and elected to receive these home and community based services instead of going into a nursing home.

513
00:52:19,841 --> 00:52:23,511
It's what they call these and my choice waiver programs. They are big.

514
00:52:23,561 --> 00:52:27,461
They are incredibly popular from the state's perspective because they allow

515
00:52:27,791 --> 00:52:31,361
they reduce the costs in nursing homes and they allow people to age in place.

516
00:52:32,051 --> 00:52:39,221
It provides home care, visiting nurses, and they'll come to your home and allow people to age in place.

517
00:52:39,971 --> 00:52:43,811
The requirement is that there is a functional and financial eligibility criteria.

518
00:52:43,811 --> 00:52:48,670
So you do need to be low income and you need to be sufficiently impaired, obviously,

519
00:52:48,671 --> 00:52:51,821
that you would have gone to a nursing home, but you're taking this waiver program.

520
00:52:53,711 --> 00:52:59,051
So these assessments are made to have someone that's a home care worker or a nurse coming to the home every 90 days,

521
00:52:59,501 --> 00:53:02,591
documenting different things about the the patient.

522
00:53:02,981 --> 00:53:08,591
And so it's amazing data. You can really model these kind of long term trajectories based on these repeat assessments.

523
00:53:09,371 --> 00:53:14,141
So these were this was a sample that was from Detroit, about 1200 people.

524
00:53:14,831 --> 00:53:19,091
They were on average, about 77 years. The vast majority were African-American and women.

525
00:53:19,631 --> 00:53:27,221
Half of them were living alone in Detroit. Over half have less than a high school education, so never graduated from high school.

526
00:53:27,521 --> 00:53:33,251
They have over three chronic health conditions on average. So very vulnerable in terms of their health.

527
00:53:33,731 --> 00:53:38,890
They have unsteady gait and the majority, vast majority use some kind of assistive device for mobility.

528
00:53:38,891 --> 00:53:45,731
So a cane, a walker, a wheelchair and 23% have barriers at the entrance to their home.

529
00:53:46,541 --> 00:53:51,401
So as a nurse, the visiting nurse, the social worker is coming to that person's home every 90 days.

530
00:53:51,401 --> 00:53:58,661
They're documenting aspects of that home in terms of safety. And one of the things they look at is how safe are those front steps?

531
00:53:59,381 --> 00:54:05,471
And, you know, are they actually is it safe for someone to step off out of their front door and down their wooden steps?

532
00:54:05,471 --> 00:54:12,580
Are there holes, cracks? Is it unstable? These are people that are living in a medically underserved area in the city of Detroit,

533
00:54:12,581 --> 00:54:21,221
where they're at or below 150% of the poverty threshold that this study was done in the early sort of mid 2000,

534
00:54:22,151 --> 00:54:29,111
at a time when Detroit was really suffering, you know, Detroit in the last half of the.

535
00:54:29,831 --> 00:54:34,041
20th century, experienced a great exodus of people leaving the city.

536
00:54:34,901 --> 00:54:38,681
You know, going into the suburbs as a result of various factors.

537
00:54:39,101 --> 00:54:45,451
But the people who could not leave were many of the older adults, low income older adults who had to remain and age in place.

538
00:54:45,461 --> 00:54:50,981
But they were aging in a place that was literally crumbling around them in terms of dilapidated housing,

539
00:54:51,251 --> 00:54:56,531
empty, abandoned buildings, and just, you know, street and sidewalks and really poor condition.

540
00:54:58,061 --> 00:55:01,231
Detroit has undergone a tremendous revival since then.

541
00:55:01,241 --> 00:55:04,601
And so I think there's been a lot of, you know, positive things that have happened.

542
00:55:04,871 --> 00:55:07,481
It's less problematic for older adults,

543
00:55:07,811 --> 00:55:15,190
although the downside is that older adults who managed to survive and stay in their place are actually being pushed out now because

544
00:55:15,191 --> 00:55:21,671
of gentrification and they're no longer able to afford the rents in the places where they have been living for so many years.

545
00:55:23,381 --> 00:55:30,161
We did our Google Street View audit, assessing, you know, what their environments were like, where these people were living.

546
00:55:30,551 --> 00:55:37,721
We asked very similar questions to what I showed you before from the square instrument, and then we created this summary accessibility score,

547
00:55:37,721 --> 00:55:43,721
which was, you know, are there sidewalks and plain place on both sides of the street, you know, around where this person is living?

548
00:55:44,051 --> 00:55:48,040
Are they continuous and is smooth a be free from obstructions?

549
00:55:48,041 --> 00:55:53,771
Are they wide enough for people to pass? And is there a public transportation stop somewhere on the street around the block?

550
00:55:54,341 --> 00:56:01,531
And we created a summary score ranging from 0 to 6 and created a mean across all four streets around the participants.

551
00:56:01,541 --> 00:56:08,651
BLOCK So this is the summary accessibility score arranges in on average, about 3.5.

552
00:56:08,661 --> 00:56:14,651
So in the higher end of accessibility, the sidewalks were in place on both sides of the street most cases.

553
00:56:14,651 --> 00:56:20,141
So that was good. 70% were continuous, smooth, flat, broken sidewalks.

554
00:56:20,461 --> 00:56:26,941
It's, you know, less common, generally free from obstructions, generally wide transit stops.

555
00:56:26,951 --> 00:56:31,381
Obviously not going to be on everybody's street, but certainly on the block.

556
00:56:31,391 --> 00:56:38,530
It's only about a third of them. The key measure, the dependent variable we were looking at here, was just outdoor mobility,

557
00:56:38,531 --> 00:56:47,321
which is the gain documented by this caseworker, asking the participant, how many days a week on average do you go out outside?

558
00:56:48,881 --> 00:56:56,951
And you can see that about very few, only about 1% go outside every day, about a quarter go outside between two and six days.

559
00:56:57,731 --> 00:57:06,101
And those 40% go outside only once in typical week, and 33% never go outside, never leave their home.

560
00:57:07,211 --> 00:57:10,331
So we were interested in seeing what are the environmental factors that shape this.

561
00:57:12,421 --> 00:57:15,031
The method that we use is an extension of growth curve modeling.

562
00:57:15,181 --> 00:57:22,861
We've got these trajectories of frequency of people going outside that we can look at, you know, over this every 90 days.

563
00:57:23,611 --> 00:57:27,451
And instead of just looking at trajectories of going outside number of days to go outside,

564
00:57:27,451 --> 00:57:31,441
we did an extension that looks at classes, latent classes of trajectories.

565
00:57:32,251 --> 00:57:34,891
So it's an extension of conventional growth modeling,

566
00:57:35,461 --> 00:57:41,401
but it says that there could actually be this instead of just one population trajectory of average going outside,

567
00:57:42,031 --> 00:57:46,831
that could be sort of distinct subgroups, distinct populations with different patterns of going outside.

568
00:57:47,671 --> 00:57:52,561
So the game, because we're using the count of the number of days that go outside, this is a causal model,

569
00:57:53,341 --> 00:58:05,551
but it's it's distinct from latent trajectory models in the sense that it is a combination of not only the latent growth curve model with the class,

570
00:58:05,761 --> 00:58:10,021
but it also has predictor variables that can predict who's going to be in these

571
00:58:10,021 --> 00:58:15,240
different trajectories and these different latent classes of trajectories.

572
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:22,591
So the whole model is running at once. It's not into separate stages, which is sort of the typical latent trajectory model.

573
00:58:24,971 --> 00:58:30,851
So we found that there were indeed two distinct trajectories of people of going outside, of patterns, of going outside.

574
00:58:30,881 --> 00:58:32,801
Over this 15 month follow up period.

575
00:58:33,941 --> 00:58:43,631
Most people, 83%, follow this trajectory, which is goes outside, you know, between one and a half days a week, sort of bumped up.

576
00:58:43,631 --> 00:58:49,391
And then they decline over time as they become more and more infirm and unhealthy.

577
00:58:49,991 --> 00:58:54,431
But there's this other group here, which is about 17% of the whole population.

578
00:58:54,431 --> 00:58:57,491
And we're looking at they almost never go out.

579
00:58:57,701 --> 00:59:01,451
They really start off at only a point to expected number of days out per week.

580
00:59:01,841 --> 00:59:04,781
But then by three months, they just they never go outside.

581
00:59:06,371 --> 00:59:13,871
And if we then can regress that late and cross membership on characteristics of individuals and the communities we see,

582
00:59:13,871 --> 00:59:19,631
that age is a big predictor of being in this latent class that almost never goes out compared to the one that goes out more frequently.

583
00:59:20,411 --> 00:59:25,151
We also see that people who have more difficulty with self-care, like bathing and dressing,

584
00:59:25,361 --> 00:59:32,691
are much more likely to be in this isolated class and gain mobility impairments and vision impairment.

585
00:59:32,711 --> 00:59:35,411
Those things are all making. People never go outside.

586
00:59:36,071 --> 00:59:42,521
But we also found that this urban accessibility score that we created from Google Street View can help people to go outside.

587
00:59:42,551 --> 00:59:45,671
So if you're living in an environment that actually is more accessible,

588
00:59:46,301 --> 00:59:50,741
you're more likely or you're less likely to be in this group that never goes out.

589
00:59:51,881 --> 00:59:57,701
Interesting to note also that people who have barriers at the entry to their home are also more likely to be in this,

590
00:59:58,411 --> 01:00:04,361
you know, isolated group, although not statistically significant at the point of high level.

591
01:00:06,881 --> 01:00:10,991
So there's a growing interest in thinking about how do people allow people to age in place?

592
01:00:11,981 --> 01:00:15,161
And really maintaining outdoor of mobility is an important step in this.

593
01:00:15,911 --> 01:00:20,891
So living on a block with accessible sidewalks, it really makes it easy for people.

594
01:00:20,891 --> 01:00:23,981
It's important to be able to have that to go outside their home.

595
01:00:24,881 --> 01:00:30,551
But obviously, if you can't get down your front steps, you know, when you have an accessible sidewalk or not, it doesn't really matter.

596
01:00:30,941 --> 01:00:36,071
So housing is important. Okay.

597
01:00:36,251 --> 01:00:39,251
So let's take a little break here and then we'll come back and talk about housing.

598
01:00:39,251 --> 01:00:42,881
And we will hear from also Nikki talking about housing as well.

599
01:00:50,381 --> 01:00:54,241
You know, it's funny you talk about this. I heard you talking.

600
01:00:54,461 --> 01:01:01,811
You haven't heard me talk about this. Not a while, but it's like your, like, core of your passion.

601
01:01:01,881 --> 01:01:08,461
Yeah. No, the hardest thing about this class for me to teach the whole class is there's so much to say.

602
01:01:08,651 --> 01:01:12,401
Yeah, and there's only 2 hours and it's only for one semester.

603
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:16,751
Only one day a week. It's a huge breath of that.

604
01:01:17,201 --> 01:01:21,601
There's so much to talk about to captivate you now.

605
01:01:21,701 --> 01:01:25,781
Debating when you had socialized folks like I did.

606
01:01:26,061 --> 01:01:31,381
Yeah. Yeah. That's a good place to do that.

607
01:01:32,071 --> 01:01:36,161
I think Lindsay's doing is what are you teaching it this semester?

608
01:01:41,121 --> 01:01:44,661
There's going to be one.

609
01:01:46,991 --> 01:02:00,501
Yeah, I remember I did this, so I thought it was, like, very cool and very novel, but I wasn't even doing that.

610
01:02:00,501 --> 01:02:08,771
But I remember that when I had, you know, students working with students doing it and working on it as well.

611
01:02:11,131 --> 01:02:14,731
It's just so much more. Yeah. Oh, sure.

612
01:02:14,891 --> 01:02:18,481
But I think that's a kind of okay and it's really.

613
01:02:18,761 --> 01:02:25,441
Yeah, great answer in a lot of ways that we could make available.

614
01:02:25,451 --> 01:02:34,211
And certainly the results that might be or that American feature that's really cool is just really

615
01:02:34,781 --> 01:02:41,531
is stamps on paper that you referenced that like collapsing broken glass and things and stone,

616
01:02:41,531 --> 01:02:44,561
which I think I mean, broken glass is the wrong word.

617
01:02:44,561 --> 01:02:49,481
There was a moniker that came out about like open window dressing like.

618
01:02:49,631 --> 01:02:54,821
Oh, yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah. So, yeah, I never knew what the original thing that was.

619
01:02:54,891 --> 01:02:58,690
Oh yeah. I think it's going to be another time.

620
01:02:58,691 --> 01:03:03,671
But that they're the ones that was about Oh yeah, we built it.

621
01:03:03,821 --> 01:03:14,110
And this is my first really kind of person, like two weeks.

622
01:03:14,111 --> 01:03:25,261
And then I like to hear the when they said we're measuring gain speed and measuring out who you're going to hire out later this year.

623
01:03:25,571 --> 01:03:31,331
And then I, you know, I see that we were doing it right in between our cubicle that we're doing.

624
01:03:32,161 --> 01:03:39,971
We're like, how, how, how, how much of you and I remember that so well.

625
01:03:40,551 --> 01:03:43,841
You're telling me how you do that.

626
01:03:44,741 --> 01:03:48,931
And then we have a really cool thing that we do.

627
01:03:48,941 --> 01:03:53,141
We didn't want to be another one. Oh, yeah, yeah.

628
01:03:53,351 --> 01:03:58,211
We learn about people's metrics. It's so hard to remember.

629
01:03:59,081 --> 01:04:05,941
Oh, yeah, yeah. Since like you said, yeah, it's just like, oh yeah, that's when I got That is amazing.

630
01:04:05,951 --> 01:04:12,241
Like, is this what you're, like, make mistakes that animated, like, ever before, I would imagine.

631
01:04:12,251 --> 01:04:17,081
And I would have never, ever considered myself, you know, if I really thought it would save my career.

632
01:04:17,561 --> 01:04:25,871
That's all, you know. And that while she and and integrating some of the other things that astronauts are doing in the neighborhood.

633
01:04:25,991 --> 01:04:30,541
Yeah. Like, I mean basically at least not yet.

634
01:04:30,551 --> 01:04:35,440
Which department potentially backing out for the emergency might have an emergency.

635
01:04:35,441 --> 01:04:47,291
But yeah, I think about yeah, I, I know your issues that India is in India, people are, you know, is it out here with you differently than I am.

636
01:04:48,311 --> 01:04:56,261
Yeah. And they are holding about this in my area they said in reference to this is verbatim copy of for yeah.

637
01:04:56,291 --> 01:05:05,201
Especially now that yeah yeah community is the future for organizations that are I think who's telling it.

638
01:05:05,591 --> 01:05:21,481
Yeah like it means you have kids are under a huge amount of confusion as well like yeah I feel like you're there so I don't know you know,

639
01:05:22,581 --> 01:05:26,831
you in a good energy. Yeah it's a good thing.

640
01:05:27,371 --> 01:05:38,351
Yeah you know it's think it's good thinking more I and it's just like now to go and I don't know like oh yeah so I've

641
01:05:39,041 --> 01:05:48,101
heard of something about your are I mean you can't control I don't want say I was like know my happiness thing right.

642
01:05:49,151 --> 01:05:58,241
I don't want to give. In 100 seconds, if I'm sorry, I'd like to.

643
01:05:58,491 --> 01:06:02,841
Oh, it's like next to we're building. Let's just do that here.

644
01:06:03,601 --> 01:06:05,391
It's not that. I don't know. It's a gamble.

645
01:06:05,541 --> 01:06:21,231
I was like, Oh, not so good about it, because I've got the transaction and I'm like, I was like, Oh, I saw you three.

646
01:06:21,851 --> 01:06:28,561
I don't understand. I associate radio construction where you're watching video.

647
01:06:28,941 --> 01:06:36,951
Yeah, 100%. I haven't talked to 100% of its situations like this.

648
01:06:37,081 --> 01:06:41,001
I like not like it's very important.

649
01:06:41,001 --> 01:06:46,911
I still remember I was there say and I'm like, Emily,

650
01:06:47,661 --> 01:06:52,864
when you're the movie and it's like you're coming over here and you're like, from the street or something.

651
01:06:55,603 --> 01:06:57,872
It's beautiful in the ring.

652
01:06:57,873 --> 01:07:23,473
And to be able to understand that when you have adjustments for at least a few weeks, it seems to me I never saw them take them to the media or me.

653
01:07:25,683 --> 01:07:28,863
Is that her boyfriend's interest? Yeah, we can do that.

654
01:07:29,163 --> 01:07:38,883
And then. I'm sorry it came up like this when I. Keep it to slide 77 over 39.

655
01:07:38,913 --> 01:07:44,443
Yeah. We have a 40 something here.

656
01:07:45,783 --> 01:07:54,072
Yeah. There you see there's this very thin air you can stand where everyone going to go?

657
01:07:54,073 --> 01:08:00,513
Sit down. I may not have the amount of. Yeah.

658
01:08:02,083 --> 01:08:09,403
Well, you know, from that, I hope they do big things.

659
01:08:10,143 --> 01:08:16,743
Yeah, like big and like. Right.

660
01:08:18,893 --> 01:08:22,073
And my guys.

661
01:08:22,213 --> 01:08:27,833
My name is Nikki. I am second year student in general epidemiology.

662
01:08:28,313 --> 01:08:35,183
And today I'll be talking to you guys about how school accessibility and residential relocation in older adults.

663
01:08:35,633 --> 01:08:39,083
So this study is conducted by all these people at the bottom.

664
01:08:40,313 --> 01:08:47,993
They are from Johns Hopkins line to university, I think, in Sweden and then Drexel and Philadelphia.

665
01:08:49,943 --> 01:08:54,833
So and I guess really quick, I'll tell you guys a little bit about me, too, just personally,

666
01:08:54,983 --> 01:09:05,153
one of the reasons I picked this study was because I personally am interested in real estate and housing, rent of home renovations, things like that.

667
01:09:05,603 --> 01:09:13,523
I've done things like replace a toilet and patch drywall, do tile floors, things like that.

668
01:09:13,523 --> 01:09:17,302
So I know it can be really expensive, time consuming.

669
01:09:17,303 --> 01:09:18,653
It requires a lot of energy.

670
01:09:18,653 --> 01:09:27,982
And so this I think is particularly important because older adults, you know, they might need renovations in their homes to help them age in place.

671
01:09:27,983 --> 01:09:34,633
But how they do that, if they're older, they might be a little bit more tired, have health conditions that they're concerned about.

672
01:09:35,273 --> 01:09:41,153
And then especially for low income, people know they don't have the funds to complete some of these projects.

673
01:09:41,753 --> 01:09:49,792
And so in addition to that, I know just personally, my parents, they're starting to get a little bit older and they've moved a few times.

674
01:09:49,793 --> 01:09:54,803
And I just thought like the impact that that had on them and how exhausting and stressful it was.

675
01:09:55,313 --> 01:10:02,033
And so, um, you know, those are a couple things I think that make this especially interesting to me.

676
01:10:02,933 --> 01:10:08,813
So just a quick overview of the study. Obviously, accessible homes help enable independence.

677
01:10:09,323 --> 01:10:13,403
They help prevent injury and enable some of the effects of disability.

678
01:10:13,523 --> 01:10:17,783
So we've got over here this guy, he is sitting on a stair glide.

679
01:10:17,993 --> 01:10:24,233
I don't know if you guys have ever seen one of these before, but they're especially important, like we talked about today,

680
01:10:24,263 --> 01:10:32,662
for people who might have, um, you know, movement impairment, maybe they're like diabetic and they have neuropathy or something.

681
01:10:32,663 --> 01:10:36,952
And so their legs lose a little bit feeling, they lose feeling in their feet.

682
01:10:36,953 --> 01:10:42,203
And so they can't walk up walk up stairs as easily. Oh, and also check the price on these.

683
01:10:42,203 --> 01:10:45,563
They're about 2000 to $10000.

684
01:10:45,563 --> 01:10:49,253
So that's pretty expensive, not inconsiderable.

685
01:10:49,973 --> 01:10:59,093
So most studies actually focus exclusively on the relationship between health status and demographics as predictors of relocation.

686
01:10:59,453 --> 01:11:08,003
This is really important. There have been ties between these factors and relocation of residential care facilities specifically.

687
01:11:08,853 --> 01:11:14,273
And so this was actually the first study using a very large nationally representative

688
01:11:14,273 --> 01:11:20,303
sample to look at factors inside the home in addition to these factors.

689
01:11:20,633 --> 01:11:25,703
So they showed that poor indoor accessibility is associated with relocation within the community, actually.

690
01:11:26,153 --> 01:11:35,363
And we'll talk about that a little bit more later, as well as what they found regarding relocation to residential care facilities.

691
01:11:36,293 --> 01:11:43,403
So this gap in particular looking at housing factors is important because what they found could help support process

692
01:11:43,403 --> 01:11:52,943
changes and policy changes leading to more innovative ways of helping older adults modify their home potentially,

693
01:11:52,943 --> 01:11:56,453
or maybe get additional help in the home for care.

694
01:11:57,293 --> 01:12:04,583
There's a lot of different things and like you mentioned, there's a ton of different ways you can go with this water to think about.

695
01:12:06,113 --> 01:12:13,403
So quick summary of the study. The purpose, like I said, was investigate whether home factors like entrance and indoor accessibility,

696
01:12:13,973 --> 01:12:20,273
bathroom safety and housing type and condition are associated with relocation for older adults.

697
01:12:21,233 --> 01:12:27,683
They actually looked at relocation within the community and relocation to residential care facilities.

698
01:12:28,073 --> 01:12:34,913
So a couple of different moves that they're looking at here. The methods that they use at prospective cohort study,

699
01:12:35,843 --> 01:12:42,232
they used the National Health and Aging Trends study and has it looked at four years from baseline?

700
01:12:42,233 --> 01:12:50,123
So they had a pretty large sample, about 7000 Medicare beneficiaries living in the community.

701
01:12:50,933 --> 01:12:57,923
They watched them or they didn't watch them. I guess they looked at their data over four years to see if they had any moves within that time frame.

702
01:12:58,763 --> 01:13:03,053
But then something else to note, I kind of noticed, I guess during the reading last night,

703
01:13:03,713 --> 01:13:08,963
this totally excludes those who, you know, may not have a home.

704
01:13:09,353 --> 01:13:14,693
And so that's a huge, you know, population, I guess that.

705
01:13:15,773 --> 01:13:21,863
Is not included in this study. So obviously, you have to have a home to be able to relocate in the first place.

706
01:13:23,003 --> 01:13:27,293
They oversample African-Americans and older participants age 85 and older.

707
01:13:27,323 --> 01:13:34,163
So that was they did a good job there, making sure that they had the data to support the conclusions that they drew.

708
01:13:35,003 --> 01:13:43,733
And then additionally, they used multi nominal regression logistics to evaluate these two different types of moves, which is a little bit different.

709
01:13:43,853 --> 01:13:51,233
We'll talk about that later to these survey weights to make it generalizable to the United States population as a whole, which is great.

710
01:13:51,833 --> 01:13:59,033
And then they did subgroup analysis for the movers to residential care facilities.

711
01:13:59,543 --> 01:14:05,723
And so they looked at those who moved to nursing homes, independent living locations.

712
01:14:05,723 --> 01:14:11,423
And then there was another type of work on some kind of residential care location that was not a nursing home.

713
01:14:11,453 --> 01:14:16,073
So three different types. And then they controlled for demographics and health conditions.

714
01:14:16,793 --> 01:14:20,303
So that was nice, too, that they did that. All right.

715
01:14:20,313 --> 01:14:29,453
So overall, they found that 13.4% of the participants within their study population moved.

716
01:14:30,233 --> 01:14:34,433
And then using weights, they. Yes.

717
01:14:34,643 --> 01:14:38,543
What is the work that they were sampling right now?

718
01:14:39,533 --> 01:14:42,833
Extrapolated that to represent the entire U.S. population as a whole.

719
01:14:43,403 --> 01:14:50,033
And they found that 8.2%, supposedly of the entire, you know, would represent the entire United States population,

720
01:14:50,363 --> 01:14:55,763
moved within the community and then 3.9% moved to residential care facilities.

721
01:14:56,123 --> 01:14:59,903
So this is important because it's actually lower than what previous studies had found.

722
01:15:02,063 --> 01:15:04,493
So I'm not sure if they didn't draw any conclusions from that,

723
01:15:04,493 --> 01:15:09,293
but they do think that it's more representative of the entire U.S. population as a whole.

724
01:15:10,343 --> 01:15:16,193
And then what they found was that after adjusting for demographics and health conditions,

725
01:15:16,673 --> 01:15:21,923
indoor accessibility was found to be associated with community within community relocation.

726
01:15:23,063 --> 01:15:28,973
Those who lived in a single floor unit had about 42%.

727
01:15:29,483 --> 01:15:36,803
They were 42% less likely to have relocated than those not living in a single fourth floor unit.

728
01:15:37,523 --> 01:15:42,593
So, like, you know, a two storey house or not a multi-story, very complex.

729
01:15:42,953 --> 01:15:47,873
And then in addition, they found that older adults with a lift,

730
01:15:47,873 --> 01:15:53,273
a stair glide like we saw earlier, or those with the bed, bath and kitchen on the same floor,

731
01:15:53,303 --> 01:16:04,103
they actually had about a 50% that 50% less likelihood of moving compared to those who did not have those features within their home.

732
01:16:05,213 --> 01:16:07,283
And so you can see it was significant.

733
01:16:07,943 --> 01:16:18,003
And then they also found that there was no association between home environmental factors and those moving to residential care facilities.

734
01:16:18,053 --> 01:16:21,653
So nursing homes and some of those other types that we talked about.

735
01:16:24,963 --> 01:16:33,213
All right. So for community movers, some of the factors that indicated increased risk were living alone.

736
01:16:33,843 --> 01:16:37,533
Medicaid entered the eligibility. Shorter length of residence.

737
01:16:37,773 --> 01:16:41,423
Lower annual income. Hospital admissions in the last year.

738
01:16:41,433 --> 01:16:45,122
Living in your apartment. And then lack of indoor accessibility.

739
01:16:45,123 --> 01:16:48,413
So that was our main outcome of interest.

740
01:16:49,833 --> 01:16:52,863
So those are just the bivariate analysis factors.

741
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:59,133
And then after adjustment, they found that shorter length of residence, hospital admissions,

742
01:16:59,403 --> 01:17:06,483
higher self-rated health and lack of indoor accessibility were all associated with moving within the community.

743
01:17:09,103 --> 01:17:11,713
See, I'm trying to think if I had anything else to say about that.

744
01:17:16,093 --> 01:17:21,493
I guess we can talk about that more in the discussion too, because some of these things like higher self-rated health,

745
01:17:22,513 --> 01:17:31,063
that one of the reasons for that obviously is that if you are healthier, you have the capacity to move.

746
01:17:32,683 --> 01:17:40,572
You don't you may not find as many barriers to moving. But then in addition, hospital admissions in the last year.

747
01:17:40,573 --> 01:17:43,392
So that's kind of contradictory.

748
01:17:43,393 --> 01:17:52,243
I guess you have higher self-rated health, but you may have also have had increased admissions, hospital admissions in the last year.

749
01:17:53,303 --> 01:17:58,603
So we'll discuss that later. But those are the findings for community members.

750
01:17:59,203 --> 01:18:02,473
So just taking a look, this is a little blurry, actually,

751
01:18:03,493 --> 01:18:11,653
but these are all the factors that they found associated with relocating within the community using unadjusted analysis.

752
01:18:12,013 --> 01:18:15,223
So individually, each of these things had a significant association.

753
01:18:15,913 --> 01:18:20,503
And then we'll flip to the adjusted analysis. Okay.

754
01:18:20,863 --> 01:18:23,953
We move. Oh, here we go. You ask about it.

755
01:18:24,673 --> 01:18:30,462
Okay. So there's unadjusted and they're adjusted. And these are all of these factors.

756
01:18:30,463 --> 01:18:34,993
So let's see, some of them do call out.

757
01:18:34,993 --> 01:18:43,452
Hospital admissions within the last year had about 48% higher risk of relocation within the

758
01:18:43,453 --> 01:18:48,463
community compared to those who were not admitted to the hospital within the last year.

759
01:18:49,453 --> 01:18:52,063
And then, like we said, indoor accessibility.

760
01:18:52,063 --> 01:19:01,093
So like single floor versus multiple floors and multiple floors, but having a lift, stair glide or those rooms on the same floor.

761
01:19:01,483 --> 01:19:05,653
Those are those indicate a decreased risk for relocation within the community.

762
01:19:08,223 --> 01:19:15,452
All right. So taking a look at the residential care movers, all of these things like we talked about earlier,

763
01:19:15,453 --> 01:19:21,243
a lot of demographic factors were related to relocating to a residential care facility,

764
01:19:23,223 --> 01:19:31,683
increasing age, being a woman, living alone, adult difficulties an adult is activities of daily living.

765
01:19:31,683 --> 01:19:37,803
So normal things like, you know, tying your shoe, grooming, what else,

766
01:19:38,523 --> 01:19:43,253
cooking all these different things, home maintenance you need to do on a daily basis.

767
01:19:43,863 --> 01:19:48,783
The difficulties with those and then falls hospital admissions in the last year possible

768
01:19:48,783 --> 01:19:55,832
probable dementia and then another one was increased number of bathroom safety features.

769
01:19:55,833 --> 01:20:03,453
I think I forgot to mention about that earlier. Um, one that I had a question about was income.

770
01:20:04,203 --> 01:20:12,603
Well, we'll take a look at that because actually within the paper they mentioned that lower income I have the quote,

771
01:20:12,633 --> 01:20:17,462
the way that they interpreted it was a little I was confused because they interpreted

772
01:20:17,463 --> 01:20:23,883
the same like risk factor for income differently in a different part of the paper.

773
01:20:24,903 --> 01:20:32,583
But we'll look at that later. So after adjustment still you had some of the same socio demographic features increasing age,

774
01:20:33,063 --> 01:20:40,503
higher education, living alone, shorter length of residence, dementia and hospital admissions.

775
01:20:41,073 --> 01:20:49,533
So you'll note here that even after adjustment for these residential care members, home features were not a factor.

776
01:20:50,133 --> 01:20:54,243
They were not found to be associated significantly anyways with relocation.

777
01:20:55,173 --> 01:20:59,193
So that that was interesting. But you still have a lot of these demographic factors still there.

778
01:21:02,123 --> 01:21:09,323
Some of the factors associated with decreased risk or likelihood of moving one were not being wider Caucasian.

779
01:21:09,623 --> 01:21:15,923
So two other race ethnicities that they looked at were, I believe, black and African-American.

780
01:21:15,923 --> 01:21:19,763
And then I can't remember what the other one was.

781
01:21:20,613 --> 01:21:24,773
I have to look at. There were only two. Was it Hispanic? I think it was two.

782
01:21:25,523 --> 01:21:36,353
Yeah. So if you were you know, if you self as either of those race ethnicities, you had a decreased risk of moving to residential care.

783
01:21:36,563 --> 01:21:42,113
So that was interesting. No associations found for home environmental factors, like I mentioned.

784
01:21:43,163 --> 01:21:52,103
And then they actually did a subgroup analysis and found that lower income and lower self-rated health increased the odds of moving to a nursing home.

785
01:21:53,273 --> 01:21:59,813
So that was interesting because, you know, nursing homes are expensive.

786
01:22:00,473 --> 01:22:04,753
Obviously the lower self-rated health. Intuitively, that makes sense.

787
01:22:04,763 --> 01:22:10,732
If you're less healthy, you're going to need help. Maybe not in the home, but outside of the home.

788
01:22:10,733 --> 01:22:18,343
So they moved to a nursing home, but then they did not find any associations for race ethnicity in this particular study.

789
01:22:18,353 --> 01:22:24,253
So that was interesting because the authors suggest that there might be some changes going on.

790
01:22:25,043 --> 01:22:34,853
Maybe people of different races and ethnicities have more access than they did previously to aging in their place of choice, I guess.

791
01:22:36,353 --> 01:22:39,773
Yeah. And access or differential are different residential care settings.

792
01:22:40,623 --> 01:22:41,783
And so that was interesting.

793
01:22:42,203 --> 01:22:51,143
Some studies have found different things, like there was an association between race, ethnicity and a residential care location.

794
01:22:54,993 --> 01:23:06,503
All right. So this is just showing all of these factors alone are associated with moving to a nursing home or any other residential care facility.

795
01:23:07,433 --> 01:23:14,213
So that was interesting. Let's see. One of the largest risk is dementia.

796
01:23:14,303 --> 01:23:23,873
Probable dementia versus no dementia had almost a five risk factor or risk ratio of five, almost.

797
01:23:24,293 --> 01:23:34,613
So that's like 400% increased risk. Some of the other ones will see the next highest one was the hospital stay.

798
01:23:35,243 --> 01:23:42,053
Yes. Versus now they had 2.5. Their risk ratio is like hundred and 50% increased risk.

799
01:23:43,493 --> 01:23:48,083
And then if we look at the adjusted analysis,

800
01:23:49,493 --> 01:24:00,473
you still have some of those same demographic features that are associated with increased risk, but not the whole factors.

801
01:24:01,763 --> 01:24:05,993
All right. So for income, actually, let's take a look here really quick.

802
01:24:09,063 --> 01:24:15,423
I think they said. Okay.

803
01:24:15,423 --> 01:24:20,523
So income is associated for bivariate analysis. Bear with me here for a second.

804
01:24:26,903 --> 01:24:30,653
All right. So the risk is point eight, eight, nine.

805
01:24:33,773 --> 01:24:38,023
Wait. That's 2.79. It is significant.

806
01:24:40,603 --> 01:24:46,363
So that would mean lower income is associated with increased risk.

807
01:24:48,383 --> 01:24:51,913
Lower income is associated. Yeah.

808
01:24:52,333 --> 01:24:55,403
Higher income is associated with reduced risk. Right. Yeah. Okay.

809
01:24:55,423 --> 01:24:58,962
And they did not state that correctly. And in fact in the paper they didn't, did they?

810
01:24:58,963 --> 01:25:02,053
They got it. They made a mistake. Okay. I thought, I'm not crazy.

811
01:25:02,113 --> 01:25:06,403
I am not reading this relevant. Okay. We'll look at that later.

812
01:25:08,233 --> 01:25:13,903
But anyway, so a lot of things still associated, but not housing.

813
01:25:15,553 --> 01:25:17,813
Some of these housing factors. Nice.

814
01:25:17,893 --> 01:25:25,183
Like we mentioned, this was the first study to show indoor accessibility is associated with relocation within the community for older adults.

815
01:25:25,183 --> 01:25:31,452
So that's obviously important because, um, it's kind of opens the door for new evidence,

816
01:25:31,453 --> 01:25:39,403
I guess for to support policy improvements and some of these changes that might be needed to support aging in place,

817
01:25:40,573 --> 01:25:47,083
homes without stairs, with lifts or steering lines for those with stairs or with bathroom,

818
01:25:47,083 --> 01:25:51,013
bedroom and kitchen on the same floor can support older adults aging in place.

819
01:25:51,313 --> 01:25:56,533
This is important because most U.S. homes are not well suited for older adults.

820
01:25:56,983 --> 01:26:01,413
I think the US Department of Housing and something or other.

821
01:26:01,423 --> 01:26:06,943
They conducted a study and found that the majority of U.S. housing stock has problematic features.

822
01:26:07,983 --> 01:26:14,443
And this is important because 50% of older adults have difficulty performing these adult tasks.

823
01:26:15,133 --> 01:26:23,323
And then by 2030, the U.S. Census Bureau actually showed that 21% of the entire American population will be older adults.

824
01:26:23,683 --> 01:26:34,423
So that's a rate of 10,000 people per day turning age 65 for the next almost ten years until 2030, which that's a ton of people.

825
01:26:35,923 --> 01:26:45,882
Um, this is also important because they, although they looked at some of these like more tangible features like home, you know,

826
01:26:45,883 --> 01:26:50,383
whether the home's on one level, whether they have stairs leading up to the entrance,

827
01:26:50,383 --> 01:26:53,683
things like that, they didn't focus on some of the reasons for moving.

828
01:26:54,013 --> 01:26:55,273
So they show the association,

829
01:26:55,273 --> 01:27:02,923
but they don't know if that association was actually taken into consideration cognitively by these people who are moving.

830
01:27:03,733 --> 01:27:12,222
So some of these studies later on should probably use the same data and then incorporate reasons for moving the desirability of the

831
01:27:12,223 --> 01:27:19,333
destination that they actually want to move where they ended up moving some of the financial implications and health outcomes.

832
01:27:19,333 --> 01:27:22,333
So after they move, did it help them improve their health?

833
01:27:22,963 --> 01:27:31,303
Did it have so much of a financial impact, either good or bad, that it changed their health trajectory?

834
01:27:32,143 --> 01:27:40,603
And then so obviously this will help us identify if the move was truly related to accessibility and then that help with some of these other things.

835
01:27:43,693 --> 01:27:54,223
See, I want to go back really quick to and just look at this picture, because one of the things that they looked at was bathroom safety.

836
01:27:54,793 --> 01:27:58,723
And previous studies had actually found that some of these features,

837
01:27:58,723 --> 01:28:05,023
like the raised toilet seat or the grab bars, actually helped with aging in place.

838
01:28:05,023 --> 01:28:09,343
And they showed an association between that and being able to stay in the home.

839
01:28:10,123 --> 01:28:17,893
But this particular study did not find the same thing, and the authors were surprised that they didn't find an association for bathroom safety.

840
01:28:18,283 --> 01:28:24,312
So I thought that was interesting, and obviously that's going to be a little bit cheaper than adding a sewer line.

841
01:28:24,313 --> 01:28:27,703
And so that's definitely something that older adults could implement in their home.

842
01:28:28,243 --> 01:28:32,623
And I think it would help, obviously with falls, help prevent falls and whatnot.

843
01:28:33,253 --> 01:28:37,903
But for whatever reason, you know, they didn't find an association between that and moving.

844
01:28:39,103 --> 01:28:48,402
However, I wonder, though, if if they were to take some of these more subjective measures into account, what that would show.

845
01:28:48,403 --> 01:28:53,953
So that would be interesting to see if things like that made a difference.

846
01:28:55,543 --> 01:29:06,473
All right. So see. We've got some of the strengths of the study was that as a project prospective study design.

847
01:29:06,473 --> 01:29:16,283
So obviously that makes it more. I guess it supports more like the causation model potentially.

848
01:29:16,313 --> 01:29:25,733
It was a large study, it was nationally representative, and then they also did some novel analysis with the multi nominal logistic regression.

849
01:29:26,003 --> 01:29:32,242
I think that in particular is novel, but the way that they compared two different moves within two moves,

850
01:29:32,243 --> 01:29:34,583
the two different types of destinations within the same model.

851
01:29:34,973 --> 01:29:44,033
I think that was particularly new for this realm of inquiry and so some of the limitations.

852
01:29:44,243 --> 01:29:51,173
They actually only measured seven home accessibility factors like for instance, steps leading up to the entrance,

853
01:29:51,563 --> 01:30:04,313
whether the people lived in an apartment or a single family home, whereas another one single for work versus multi for the bathroom safety features.

854
01:30:06,533 --> 01:30:07,432
There were a couple of other ones,

855
01:30:07,433 --> 01:30:18,583
but only seven in total versus a Swedish study actually use 188 factors from the European housing enabler, which I thought was interesting.

856
01:30:18,593 --> 01:30:23,872
So it would be interesting to see a study done in the US using all of those different

857
01:30:23,873 --> 01:30:28,523
factors and all those relate to aging in place and whether or not people move.

858
01:30:29,603 --> 01:30:36,203
And then here's another thing I noticed. They actually included financial data for almost half of the sample.

859
01:30:36,293 --> 01:30:42,023
So I thought that was interesting because imputation, I do understand how it works.

860
01:30:42,263 --> 01:30:46,072
So statistically and you know why it's a good idea.

861
01:30:46,073 --> 01:30:53,212
But still, I'm very skeptical, especially when you're imputing almost half of the sample financial data.

862
01:30:53,213 --> 01:30:57,803
And so I know probably a lot of older adults just don't want to give their financial information out.

863
01:30:58,673 --> 01:31:08,273
But I wonder if the study results would change a little bit, especially demographically, if they were able to get the actual data.

864
01:31:10,043 --> 01:31:13,973
And then, like we said, they did not collect data on actual reasons for moving.

865
01:31:14,723 --> 01:31:22,703
So that would be valuable in further studies. I think it would help support some of these decisions that they want to make.

866
01:31:24,083 --> 01:31:28,223
All right. So my discussion question is, here's the first one that I talked about earlier.

867
01:31:28,673 --> 01:31:37,103
This is what they said. Not being white Caucasians, having a lower annual income malaba decreased the likelihood of moving to a residential facility.

868
01:31:37,613 --> 01:31:41,013
So I think that was it's got to be correct. Wrong. Yeah.

869
01:31:41,063 --> 01:31:44,723
That's I thought it was interesting because this is out of Johns Hopkins. Johns Hopkins.

870
01:31:45,113 --> 01:31:51,262
And so they could also be the reviewers as well in the journal can pick up on it too and just.

871
01:31:51,263 --> 01:31:56,663
Yeah, yeah. It was interesting that when you review manuscripts, look for these things.

872
01:31:58,133 --> 01:32:02,663
So some of my discussion questions were, let's see,

873
01:32:03,593 --> 01:32:09,323
community movers are more likely than non movers to have worse indoor accessibility and rate their health better.

874
01:32:10,613 --> 01:32:16,283
So they were more likely to have been admitted to a hospital. So this kind of like a reading comprehension check if anyone read the paper.

875
01:32:16,733 --> 01:32:23,003
What could be some possible reasons for this? And then my next question is what programs,

876
01:32:23,003 --> 01:32:32,273
businesses or innovations can help improve the situation of the housing stock being incompatible with aging in place?

877
01:32:32,993 --> 01:32:37,193
And then what are some policies that could help older adults better age in place?

878
01:32:42,733 --> 01:32:45,043
Yeah. Great presentation and great discussion questions.

879
01:32:45,373 --> 01:32:53,353
Yeah, I had a question which was it'd be so interesting to see the people that move within the community where they're moving to, you know,

880
01:32:53,363 --> 01:32:58,673
go and have will be able to follow them and see, you know, are they moving to a house that is more accessible,

881
01:32:58,693 --> 01:33:04,842
you know, to see that they're actually making improvements? Right. Yeah, that was one of the things I was thinking to that.

882
01:33:04,843 --> 01:33:11,773
And then after they get there, like, are they happy about the move? Did it help them better?

883
01:33:13,003 --> 01:33:16,933
H More successfully, things like that.

884
01:33:17,793 --> 01:33:21,553
Um, yeah, I, I was just curious like if you felt like,

885
01:33:21,973 --> 01:33:34,183
was there any effort to control for whether the community members were just going to become like nursing home movers

886
01:33:34,183 --> 01:33:41,443
with enough time and that it was actually the same group on different temporal ones versus like two distinct groups?

887
01:33:41,593 --> 01:33:48,372
Yeah, that is a good question. So they only looked at four years and they actually only used the first move in their analysis

888
01:33:48,373 --> 01:33:52,363
so that it's very possible that someone could have moved within the community and then,

889
01:33:52,693 --> 01:33:56,863
you know, maybe they weren't satisfied with the home that they moved to and then they ultimately moved into a nursing home.

890
01:33:57,193 --> 01:34:02,323
They didn't assess that, but that that would be something interesting to look at.

891
01:34:02,473 --> 01:34:09,203
Yeah, that's a cool idea. You know, there's this thing called sequence analysis, which you can kind of model typologies and pathways and sequence.

892
01:34:09,883 --> 01:34:13,813
They're going to look at who's doing different sequences and what's the time period between those.

893
01:34:14,083 --> 01:34:20,622
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I literally like that happened with my grandmother where like she moved out of her house that she'd been in for 30 years.

894
01:34:20,623 --> 01:34:28,333
And then they we like trialed like a smaller apartment closer to like one of her daughters, but then that didn't works.

895
01:34:28,333 --> 01:34:36,163
And then she went to like a home. But there was like this like trial that occurred before the actual, like.

896
01:34:37,963 --> 01:34:44,593
Um, it's interesting that the community or the home features don't impact that move to a nursing home.

897
01:34:44,593 --> 01:34:47,893
They just impact the move to somewhere else in the community. Yeah.

898
01:34:48,273 --> 01:34:53,562
If you're going to a nursing home, it's, it's, you know, it's not necessarily because you don't have a features,

899
01:34:53,563 --> 01:35:00,133
it's just that you're at that point where you cannot even from beyond that point of trying to rectify that dependance.

900
01:35:00,353 --> 01:35:10,452
Yeah. Yeah. And then kind of to your point, so, you know, to like if they're in a home and they need to move somewhere else a lot.

901
01:35:10,453 --> 01:35:16,423
I feel like anecdotally a lot of older adults might want to downsize and so maybe they move into an apartment

902
01:35:16,543 --> 01:35:24,263
or something in an apartment this study showed increases your risk of contracting different things to see.

903
01:35:27,763 --> 01:35:33,222
Yeah. Moving into a nursing home or and moving within the community.

904
01:35:33,223 --> 01:35:39,073
So does that like did you just you think you're doing better for yourself by moving into an apartment?

905
01:35:39,073 --> 01:35:46,663
But then actually, that might not be the most ideal thing to do because surely the residents associated with.

906
01:35:49,523 --> 01:35:53,653
This is community. Yeah.

907
01:35:53,743 --> 01:36:00,693
Yeah. This is with resident movers. So like and that also kind of puts this narrative of like, are you, like, moving into an apartment?

908
01:36:00,703 --> 01:36:05,143
Then you can be better, but then wasn't. And it's like probably going to be a short amount of time.

909
01:36:05,143 --> 01:36:08,593
But this other house where you lived for, like, maybe a decade. Yeah.

910
01:36:08,643 --> 01:36:13,783
Just further, you know, increasing your risk again. So that was interesting.

911
01:36:15,813 --> 01:36:24,123
Yeah. What do you what do you think about policies and interventions and, you know, issues around you?

912
01:36:24,143 --> 01:36:32,733
Yeah. Innovations that can improve and allow people to, you know, avoid getting into a nursing home or to age that are in their homes.

913
01:36:33,123 --> 01:36:42,863
What are some of the things that can be done? KING There's a lot of different ways that you can come at that.

914
01:36:44,993 --> 01:36:52,462
In-Home health, I think, is huge. I think we talked about this earlier in our lecture is that there was that program,

915
01:36:52,463 --> 01:36:58,583
the Michigan program that you talked about, the gave people credit for having home care come into their home and help.

916
01:37:00,083 --> 01:37:07,763
So the theme of that is that, as we saw just now with COVID, you know, those people are paid enough and they're first line workers.

917
01:37:07,763 --> 01:37:12,413
And so they are usually impacted the most when something like COVID happens.

918
01:37:15,633 --> 01:37:28,263
So I think maybe policies around improving education and working conditions and income for those types of positions would be helpful,

919
01:37:29,043 --> 01:37:38,043
especially since as we continue moving towards 2030, we're going have all these people by the age of 65, a lot of them may need in-home care.

920
01:37:38,943 --> 01:37:43,733
And so I think things like that, policies around that would help. Yeah, that's a good point.

921
01:37:45,553 --> 01:37:48,553
One of the other you a chance to get through all the signs.

922
01:37:48,553 --> 01:37:56,053
But that was going to show you that a randomized controlled trial that was done for vulnerable older adults in Baltimore,

923
01:37:56,413 --> 01:38:04,213
and they were randomized to either an intervention that was just, you know, home support, social support.

924
01:38:04,873 --> 01:38:07,873
And the intervention arm was a handyman.

925
01:38:09,493 --> 01:38:18,373
Mm hmm. And they found that this handyman could actually reduce their odds of disability, allow them to, you know, age in place longer.

926
01:38:18,853 --> 01:38:24,103
So it's just, you know, someone to come in and, like, turn them, fix a light bulb, right?

927
01:38:24,103 --> 01:38:30,433
To change a light bulb so that you can see where you're going to get rid of the uneven floors and just little things like that,

928
01:38:30,673 --> 01:38:37,413
you know, could make a big difference. Yeah. And to install some of these different things like the bathroom safety or, you know,

929
01:38:37,483 --> 01:38:41,622
the sterilize, if that's affordable, feasible, different things like that.

930
01:38:41,623 --> 01:38:46,452
And then also imagine changes to building codes could be helpful to make it to where

931
01:38:46,453 --> 01:38:51,133
some of these homes could be easily modified and then maybe be modified so that,

932
01:38:52,393 --> 01:38:58,573
you know, the homes can easily be resold again in the future and then people have to come in and do all that.

933
01:38:59,473 --> 01:39:00,882
Yeah, that's a really important point.

934
01:39:00,883 --> 01:39:06,523
So, you know, ramps are really great for older adults in their homes and they, you know, can no longer have to step aside.

935
01:39:06,523 --> 01:39:14,943
They've got a wheelchair, then you'll build a ramp outside their homes. But that's not easy to sell once that older person has moved out.

936
01:39:14,943 --> 01:39:19,123
10 million people or people don't want to have a home with a huge ramp outside.

937
01:39:19,873 --> 01:39:24,063
Older adults also are reluctant to put those ramps in because they feel they're going to get targeted,

938
01:39:24,073 --> 01:39:29,203
like, Oh, that old person lives here who has trouble. I'm going to be able to go in and rob that house more easily.

939
01:39:30,553 --> 01:39:33,333
So, you know, all these kind of different things. But why do we have to?

940
01:39:34,033 --> 01:39:38,833
Are there other ways that we can make homes accessible rather than just putting these huge ramps up front?

941
01:39:39,223 --> 01:39:45,583
You know, but again, like as you're saying, Nikki, what can we do to make homes accessible for everybody?

942
01:39:46,123 --> 01:39:51,733
You know, the zero step entryway is is such an easy thing to do, is don't build the steps in the front of the house.

943
01:39:51,733 --> 01:39:57,583
And that doesn't that's not something that's going to be an issue with resale, you know, to younger family.

944
01:39:58,873 --> 01:40:02,673
And I think it's a very. Oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead. Oh, no, I just love it.

945
01:40:02,683 --> 01:40:08,133
I love commenting know stuff because one of the reasons I moved out of my previous apartments because of the.
