1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:05,850
Why? Why did you decide this was a good idea for the office of this particular work space?

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:15,270
Yeah, my personality is the thing about me is actually just like putting your cell phone.

3
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:27,610
So I'm like, yes, I made a ten year old so we don't have to bargain and just have to try New Year out.

4
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:32,770
So I don't I mean, none of us have to log in and just shared it with the lake and then make it into a tiny euro.

5
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:38,230
So they have to put ten year old dot com slash bakery press pop off the slides.

6
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:43,749
Yeah, I know I have.

7
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:58,240
You have to be either friends or can I start Peter first.

8
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:13,530
I just started recording. So, my missus, you use your income somewhere?

9
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:17,240
I don't need my account. I made a tiny URL so I don't have to log in.

10
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:21,370
Oh. Okay. After.

11
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:43,240
What do you do for other people? I'm good.

12
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:49,800
I'm good. Not great. Is it?

13
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:58,390
Maybe making music for your comic or how I kind of see your writing here.

14
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:08,760
I know that a lot of the stuff that she's been sharing said, but no, not yet.

15
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,580
Okay. All right. I just want to.

16
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:22,130
So maybe you've never met a more so. Oh.

17
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:33,469
Okay. Just remind you that I'd like to share your presentation slides with the class.

18
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:41,750
So we send your presentation slides to me. I forgot to ask for this, and I think it's good that you spent quite a bit of time preparing your slides.

19
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:49,639
They look all very interesting. I really want to sort of have this available for everyone,

20
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:58,800
so send that to me and and also remember to schedule meeting with me and so we can discuss your final project and um,

21
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,810
so not are things that we have a better job kind of the economy.

22
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:06,860
So I have to move the seminar to 430 now so I'm going to hurt.

23
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,200
I'm awfully sorry.

24
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:15,710
Both of you can either come to talk to me during my office hours of schedule meetings, or you can stop by to talk about your project.

25
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:19,500
I will be available at 430 up to this lecture. Yeah.

26
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:25,519
So these features and the slides would be you just have to call them on the theme sheet and link our resolutions.

27
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:29,090
Do you think that's what we can do either way?

28
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:34,520
Yeah, I would've been posted. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

29
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:43,520
Since I've almost finished grading this, I, I agree with all the projects presented to be on Friday.

30
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:46,610
Yeah. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

31
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:55,100
Let's just, just, I don't know what, I still have some time slots available for Friday, so I also saw you asked me about Greta.

32
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:03,709
I know there are some members that I plan to retire the Green Project back to you because you need to see my comments.

33
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:07,660
I made a lot of detail comments, my thoughts, but um.

34
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:17,300
Yeah, so if you can talk to me Thursday or Friday, I can also have your grade the projects available so that we can all look at your, um,

35
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:31,580
looking ahead plans and whatever the something I want on out your, your project, your, the data capture project and okay time, but oh yes.

36
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:38,660
Okay. So 20 minutes for presentation, 5 minutes for questions.

37
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:42,940
Okay go ahead. Time it whenever you.

38
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:47,660
Um. Well, right. Okay. Well, hello. Today done.

39
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:50,930
Daniella and I will talk about the dataset we created.

40
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:55,820
It's United States county wide dataset of unemployment rate and weekly wage.

41
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:04,400
So what we're interested in there, economic wearables. Previous studies have shown that the CO in 19 pandemic has some effect on the economy.

42
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:12,590
First, unemployment increased in the US and abroad, and second, the income and poverty just fluctuated during the pandemic.

43
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:20,330
However, the association between those economic variables and the COVID 19 mortality were not fully investigated.

44
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:29,420
So data says AI employment rate and average income will allow the researchers to understand the economic climate across the U.S.,

45
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:39,260
while the Bureau of Labor Statistics provide easily accessible statewide datasets of unemployment rate and average weekly duties,

46
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:43,820
it is often cumbersome to access the county level analysis,

47
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:53,180
and our goal is just to acquire the county level dataset describing the unemployment rate and average weekly wage of each US company over time.

48
00:05:54,650 --> 00:06:02,240
And that's part of the pattern. Okay, so we have two main sources.

49
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:11,629
The first one is the barrier of labor statistics. We use the multiscreen data retrieval tool to have our two main variables,

50
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:20,120
which is are county level data on wages across the United States and also county level data on employment rates across the U.S., Brazil,

51
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:26,749
U.S. We also have the second source of information, which is the COVID 19 data repository by the center system,

52
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:33,680
signs of engineering at the Johns Hopkins University, from which we retrieved the county level COVID 19 mortality.

53
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:40,220
So from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, we have three main database.

54
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:44,570
The first one contains the county level unemployment statistics,

55
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:54,380
and this is a monthly unemployment rate with an area code from years from January of 2019 to March 2022.

56
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,850
We also had another database, which is the county level wages statistics.

57
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,129
This is the quarterly average weekly wage in dollars for the area code.

58
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:10,220
And we have this information for the first quarter of 2019 until the first quarter of 2022.

59
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,799
And then finally, we have area codes,

60
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:20,600
which is the mapping between the codes that we had in these two databases with the FIPS codes for county and state names.

61
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:25,340
Finally, after our data processing, we were able to create a.

62
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:35,320
Based on has the following variables. We have year, month, water, estate, county, the zip codes, and finally the unemployment and the wage variable.

63
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:41,049
If you after this presentation want to use this database just so you know,

64
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:51,130
if they don't can be as coded as the A's digit club needs some to like map the different variables so it's very useful.

65
00:07:53,270 --> 00:08:06,969
Now let's see the overall of our captured data. So already the contents information of 3103 counties from 50 states among the 3097 counties

66
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:13,180
had the complete data of unemployment and weekly wage from January 2019 to March 2022.

67
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:21,490
Below is a picture of our first record, and from this picture you can see that the employment data is different by month.

68
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:26,770
While the weekly wage is different by quarter, together,

69
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:35,020
our understanding of the distribution of weekly wage and unemployment we calculated for each county with calculated

70
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:46,750
the average weekly wage and wage employment from 2019 to 2022 and plotted the histograms the amount all the counties.

71
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:57,910
The minimum average weekly wage is $5,500, the median is $830 and the maximum is $3,000.

72
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:09,850
And among all the counties, the minimum average employment rate is 1.2% and the median is 4.8% and the maximum is about 10%.

73
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:22,330
Oh, we also do a lot to understand how the unemployment rate and weekly wage changes across time.

74
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,320
We also do some temporal analysis.

75
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:34,050
So for eight months we calculated the average employment across all the counties and draw the line plot from this plot.

76
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:39,860
You can see that beginning around the January 21st, 2020,

77
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:50,510
when the first COVID case was determined by CDC in the U.S., the unemployment rate experienced a rapid increase.

78
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:57,200
And to the April 2020, it's registered a big ad for 10%.

79
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,790
Then it gradually drops.

80
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:13,810
So to see how the unemployment rate changes within each state, we also do the lowest regression curve for the unemployment rate by the state.

81
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:26,050
And the 50 green curves just showed that the low curve show the lowest curve for the unemployment rate by the whole nation.

82
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:37,660
And as you can see, around the time of first detected cold cases in the U.S., the unemployment rate just experienced a rapid increase.

83
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:48,700
And for it's called her. We calculated the average weekly wage across all the counties and draw the line plot.

84
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:56,740
And you can see that the weekly wage just fluctuates during the pandemic.

85
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:04,390
And again, we draw the lowest curves for by state and nation.

86
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:18,520
And you can see from the beginning the first detected case in the U.S. The weekly wage just fluctuates across the time.

87
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:25,150
Just to be clear, so your data is available on the county level.

88
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:28,660
But the policy is made based on the state level.

89
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:37,720
That right? Yes. So I use all the data of all the counties in each state to plot.

90
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:43,930
So it's always a regression curve. Oh, I see.

91
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:49,530
So each curve aca Lois. Smooth curve, all the counties.

92
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:53,560
And then you want to get it. The blue line is Luis of Luis.

93
00:11:53,740 --> 00:12:05,830
Is that right? Oh, yeah. So. So one green curve is for a state and and it incorporates all the data of the counties.

94
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:11,440
Yeah. So. So you have the county data that you did the Lois.

95
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:17,230
Yep. And then what's a blue? Blue is the across all the solar states.

96
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,940
I see. So you have you did this Luis, twice.

97
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:25,660
Why is it come to the state level, then? To the national level?

98
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:29,360
Yes. Okay. Got it. Okay. Okay.

99
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:34,540
Now we're going to talk a little bit about our spatial exploratory analysis.

100
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:41,350
So first, this is a plot of the average weekly wage by a state in the different years.

101
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:51,580
So in 2019, the average weekly wage across the United State States was $859,

102
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:57,880
with Missouri being the only state with less than 7000 dollars per year like average weekly wage.

103
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:08,920
And if states such as California, Nevada, Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Jersey had an average weekly wage of about $8,000 for 2020.

104
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:15,340
In general, there's in between years. In general, there's an increase in the average weekly wage.

105
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:23,860
For 2020, the average weekly weekly wage across the United States increased to one $919.

106
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:29,920
And Missouri is still is the only state is the state with the lowest average weekly wage.

107
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:35,740
And in states such as California, Nevada, Connecticut, New Jersey, they have the higher average weekly wage.

108
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:44,500
And we see this same pattern in Missouri being the always and California, Nevada, New Jersey being the highest across 2021 and 2022.

109
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:50,140
And in general, there's just an increasing trend, increasing trend in the average weekly wage.

110
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:56,499
We wanted to expand our analysis also to work on a county level.

111
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:04,390
So these are plots at a county level for the average weekly wage in the first quarter of each year.

112
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:06,220
As you can see,

113
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:14,830
there is not much difference between the years and that's something that we have seen either like doing temporal analysis or this is partial plots.

114
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:21,220
In general, we don't see like any significant difference between 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022,

115
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:27,460
other than there's just like an increase that's just like weekly wages increase by year.

116
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:35,650
We did. Moreover, we weren't interested in 2020 because this is like the beginning of the pandemic.

117
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:46,460
So we wanted to test whether there's a random allocation of the wages across the U.S. counties in May of 2020, in the first quarter of the year.

118
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:52,810
I'm sorry. We found that the standard deviation statistic is around 45.

119
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:57,729
We are below P P-value less or approximately zero.

120
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:07,570
So we conclude that the average weekly wage is not randomly distributed account across counties at the beginning or in the rise of the pandemic.

121
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:15,010
Now, this is the average monthly unemployment rate by state.

122
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:22,020
There is. So we can see that in 2019, the average weekly unemployed.

123
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:28,450
The average unemployed I'm sorry, the average monthly unemployment rate across the U.S. was approximately 4%.

124
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:32,890
However, there's a huge increase between 2019 and 2020.

125
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:39,130
In 2020, the average monthly unemployment rate was close to seven.

126
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:55,990
With estates such as Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Michigan and California reaching a average monthly unemployment rate of over 9% in 2021.

127
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:58,810
We see a similar trend as in 2019.

128
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:11,490
And in general, the average monthly rate decrease from 2022 2021 and in 2022 is the best year in terms of monthly unemployment rate.

129
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:18,319
All of the states reach the best possible unemployment rate a like among the four years analyzed by Biden.

130
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:26,020
Must like you. Absolutely. We also extended our analysis at home to level.

131
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:31,839
We were particularly interested in the month of May because that's the beginning of the rise of the pandemic,

132
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:36,460
particularly when in the United States we have complete quarantine.

133
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:42,130
So we can see just by looking at the map that there's a huge difference between 2019 and 2020,

134
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:46,270
which is, as we expected from the analysis that we did before.

135
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:54,069
Moreover, for 2020, for the month of May of 2020,

136
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:59,740
we wanted to test whether there was a random allocation of the unemployment rate across the u.s. counties.

137
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:06,790
We found a standard, David, a statistic of around 58 with a p value close to zero.

138
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:13,450
Therefore, we conclude that the unemployment rate among counties in the US was not randomly allocated.

139
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:18,640
And next we'll be going through some of our preliminary comparison analyzes.

140
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:24,729
Specifically, we wanted to contest this association between monthly mortality rate and our economic variables.

141
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:32,139
And as then Danielle explained, we got our data from the Johns Hopkins University data repository where we

142
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:36,940
calculated the monthly COVID 19 mortality rate at the county level by the formula,

143
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:42,190
the number of COVID 19 deaths in county during March divided by the population size,

144
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,350
further subdivided by 100,000, meaning this mortality rate this per 100,000 individuals.

145
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:54,730
So can you remind me about this of wage and unemployment rate is a monthly or is it weekly?

146
00:17:54,790 --> 00:18:00,999
It's monthly for unemployment rate and quarterly for average average rate.

147
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:09,130
But we make it such that January, February and March have the same average weekly wage for all of those months into operation.

148
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:14,950
Yes. And some of the analysis that will be showing it to be divided by census region.

149
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:19,990
Just here's a map of the different census regions of the U.S. with West, Midwest, Northeast and the south.

150
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:26,710
And to give a general idea of what I will be showing, I be calculating the correlation in two different manners.

151
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:36,700
So what is in the Blue Square would be looking at the correlation between wage and mortality, for example, across counties in a given time point.

152
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:45,370
While the red box would show that we can calculate the correlation between wage and mortality across time points for a given county.

153
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:48,010
So just two different ways of calculating correlation.

154
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:55,270
And first, I want to show you the correlation between wage and mortality rate between counties and May 2020 across census regions,

155
00:18:55,540 --> 00:19:00,129
with each point dictating one county with its average weekly wage on the x axis

156
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:05,290
in monthly COVID 19 mortality rate on the Y axis colored by the census region.

157
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:08,919
It is an overall. You see, there's no discernible pattern, really.

158
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:12,460
The Spearman quotation across all points is about 0.5.

159
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,740
But if we specifically focus on the dark yellow points which represent counties in the Northeast Census region,

160
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:23,050
we see that they have the highest spearman correlation between these variables of roughly 0.57.

161
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:26,739
But if we take this day and kind of generalize that to all time points,

162
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:32,260
we can look at the correlation between wage or mortality rate between counties across time and census region.

163
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:41,590
With that spearman correlation being on the Y axis and across time, specifically looking at the black line, which is for all counties in the US,

164
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:45,100
you see that at the beginning of the pandemic the correlation was a bit higher,

165
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:51,040
but towards the end it wasn't as high, fluctuating around zero, but as seen on the previous slide.

166
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:59,920
The northeast region, specifically at the beginning of the pandemic here, had the highest correlation between the mortality rate and wage variables.

167
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:07,420
And kind of flipping this over, we can look at the correlation between wage and mortality rate, between time points across counties in the U.S.,

168
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:16,840
where the Spearman correlation is the color and red counties indicating a high spearman correlation correspond to an interpretation where

169
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:25,930
you'd say that counties that have at a higher average wage at certain points in this county would have higher COVID 19 mortality rates.

170
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:31,750
And as you can see, the majority of the country here has a positive correlation between these variables.

171
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:39,080
Most notably, though, you do see that Florida, the Mississippi Valley and Southeast Texas do show a slightly negative correlation, but.

172
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:49,270
These variables. I wonder if this core issue will be somewhat different between Metro or a number of regions, because for this region.

173
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:54,280
So I know the eastern part of New England area that is more industrialized,

174
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:59,590
that lot of, you know, there is probably other high tech positions, higher ups.

175
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:02,890
Mm hmm. And probably more stable jobs.

176
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:11,500
And compared to other places, I just wonder if there's a differences of actual match or sort of interaction.

177
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,239
We would definitely like to use,

178
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:20,330
I believe it's really a group who had the urban and rural proficient possibly using that as a confounder in our final project.

179
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:25,839
Yeah, because now School of Public Health is very interested in urban health initiatives,

180
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:36,580
and we do have a reality index created by one team that indicates where are the metro regions and where are the number two region.

181
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:45,700
Maybe we could do a little bit of urban health study like how this pandemic has been affecting this urban versus,

182
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,980
you know, the metro versus non-metro regions and stuff like that.

183
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:54,490
Comparison analysis will be interesting to me. Yes.

184
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,940
And then now kind of looking now with unemployment break here,

185
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:02,830
we looking at the correlation between unemployment rate and mortality rate between counties and May 2020.

186
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:07,300
And once again, the points are each a county with unemployment rate now on the x axis.

187
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:13,810
And once again, you don't see a very big discernible pattern. Here is the overall Spearman correlation across all counties is 0.25.

188
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:19,630
But once again, you see that the Northeast Census region has the highest spearman correlation of 0.43.

189
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,290
And if we once again generalize this across time points,

190
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:27,790
looking at the correlation between unemployment rate and mortality rate between counties across time,

191
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:35,950
we once again see this very initial increase in correlation where it's more positive at the beginning of the pandemic.

192
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:45,060
But what I take out of most of this slide is that for all counties and the Midwest, South and west, it fluctuates between zero and zero point you.

193
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:49,750
So there's not really a strong correlation, though positive during these time points.

194
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:57,729
But once again, I find it quite interesting that the Northeast Census region has a very high correlation between

195
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:03,700
mortality rate on unemployment rate somewhere between 0.4 and 0.6 for the majority of the pandemic.

196
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,690
And if we then though, which is kind of interesting,

197
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:15,100
this paradox of looking at the correlation between unemployment rate and mortality rate, between time points across counties in the U.S.,

198
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:17,770
you see that the majority of the country is in blue,

199
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:24,940
indicating that the Spearman correlation between monthly COVID 19 mortality rate and employment rate is kind of inversely related.

200
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:31,420
So at time points within a county when the unemployment rate is high, COVID 19 mortality rate was actually low,

201
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:36,220
which you might want to hypothesize less people being exposed to not going to work.

202
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:40,360
But once again, you see the outlier position of Florida,

203
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:46,360
the Mississippi Valley in Texas that has now a positive correlation, which is different than the rest of the country.

204
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:50,620
Also seeing that in the northeast coast of the United States as well.

205
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:54,729
But you really kind of do a bit more of analysis here.

206
00:23:54,730 --> 00:24:02,020
We also want you conduct aerial data analysis by putting simultaneous sort aggressive models using all county data for May 2020.

207
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:09,610
Here we fit. The two models were in each. The response variable was monthly mortality rate while having unemployment rate or average weekly wage,

208
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:16,330
as are explanatory variables where we defined neighbors as sharing, at least county sharing at least one boundary point.

209
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:20,950
The results of this data show that for both the terms of unemployment rate and average weekly wage,

210
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:24,340
the coefficients are positive and statistically significant,

211
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,140
which would make you have a conclusion that would say something along the lines of on

212
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:35,050
average counties that have a higher unemployment rate or higher average weekly wage,

213
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:39,070
tend to have higher COVID mortality rates in May 2020.

214
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:43,600
And with that just kind of summarizing everything we've talked about,

215
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:49,149
the average weekly wage and unemployment within U.S. counties different across time with about 2 minutes.

216
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:52,450
Yes, with unemployment rate peaking in April 2020,

217
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:56,679
we also saw that average weekly wage and unemployment differed across U.S.

218
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:01,569
counties with a strong positive autocorrelation for both variables on the US map,

219
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:04,870
as given to us by the results of the and eye test.

220
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:10,480
We also saw that wage and unemployment rate are correlated with monthly mortality rate in some counties.

221
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,520
And from those our models,

222
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:20,620
we got this idea that counties with higher unemployment rates are higher wages were associated with higher COVID 19 mortality rates in May 2020.

223
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:27,819
And with that, our group would like to take the further direction for our final project by fitting different models testing for this association

224
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:34,960
between mortality and economic variables while adjusting for possible confounders like the Urban Rural Index across all U.S. counties.

225
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,860
We'd like to fit a negative binomial zero on weighted model to see how.

226
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:42,280
Model with no temple or spatial dependencies. Would you?

227
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:48,400
We'd also like to apply a common filter using the parameters from the negative binomial model we fitted,

228
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:51,730
allowing for some temporal dependency for a state space model.

229
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:58,540
We then also like to conduct and apply some simultaneous photographs of models to allow for spatial dependencies.

230
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,370
And with that, we kind of want to see how these models do by calculating the of sample

231
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:08,110
prediction error by training models and data from February 2020 to October 2021.

232
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:12,850
And then testing these models on data from November 2021 to March 2022,

233
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:21,010
which is kind of seeing how do these models work when this American outbreak just started and you saw an increase in cases and deaths possibly.

234
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:30,850
And with that, we want to thank you for listening to our presentation. Questions from Audience.

235
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:41,000
No. I see you want some of the Lewis curves.

236
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:44,600
Some of them have a situation. Some of them is just a straight line.

237
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,770
Can you account for that? Yeah. Some of fluctuates in a straight line.

238
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:55,420
I think the difference is about the only speed limit alone.

239
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:12,410
So what for some states are the the weekly wage of the counties within that state is just not that true?

240
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:16,350
It's no wonder why it's on our streets. Yeah.

241
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:23,960
So I think there are lots of they have a small fluctuation.

242
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:29,989
So after the Louise regression, they just act like a straight line.

243
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:36,190
But. But the regional they that they are relative to the composition of industry.

244
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:48,590
They like the Louisiana culture and they're not always as very homogeneous in terms of the economy right in there probably is a little bit mixed.

245
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:59,210
You have car industry, other industry. And I think the state is more sort of elements in the industry able to have the more fluctuation.

246
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:05,330
Yeah, that would be a nice thing to see whether those plus changes if we include that like.

247
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:11,960
So that's my comment that you have that probably you could name the the state that people can see.

248
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:13,870
Right. As I mentioned,

249
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:23,690
I we are guessing the tonality of the industry would be something contributed to this sort of curves and straight line and not very minimal.

250
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:33,380
But if you name that, probably we can attach our sort of potential interpretation with that kind of different patterns of the waves.

251
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:39,170
Yeah. And especially looking at say like Kansas here in the middle, it doesn't really change across time all that much.

252
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,530
So if fluctuations within the state aren't that high,

253
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:49,400
where you see places like other places like California, there's a very big difference between the states.

254
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:55,130
Some are high, some are low. So that fluctuation, as it can fluctuate over time, might change the the west curve.

255
00:28:57,050 --> 00:29:05,130
Yeah. And also this partially reflected the attitude towards COVID 19, like in a more brutal state that in the blue state,

256
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:16,600
probably people are more sort of of how see have a higher comprise of the social distance like in Texas.

257
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:25,579
I do remember I was an a year not right in March this year like here we are still wear mask but there are people that did not wear a mask at all.

258
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:29,780
And in this, the problem is there are some reason behind it.

259
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:38,389
I think that when they have, uh, sort of the minor sort of different type of attitude towards the COVID,

260
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:44,690
that probably they have different behaviors like even the unemployment rate or,

261
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:50,150
you know, average because their business are somewhat running as usual or something.

262
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:56,690
I think that's something you can think about. That's reason of that wage change.

263
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:05,330
But overall, I think this economic factor is quite useful for us to understand the story behind me.

264
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:13,520
There's no more questions. Thanks. Team number four.

265
00:30:14,810 --> 00:31:06,590
Yeah. Move on to team number five. In.

266
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:25,650
Here. You see the speakers now?

267
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:21,160
Every weekend they click on the. Oh.

268
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:25,510
I forgot what I was thinking. Oh.

269
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:31,410
Why are you asking for this? Oh, my God.

270
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:37,300
It's only this. I need to go back to my office.

271
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:42,010
Do you want to watch the notes on my computer? Oh, no, it's okay.

272
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:46,030
You can give me 5 minutes. I'll be right back. I forgot my phone in that case.

273
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:50,550
In that order. Sitting there with a guy, right?

274
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:58,180
Yeah. Well, I'm going to have to also. I think he's going to be just fine.

275
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:01,810
You know, I don't have to look at this because, you know, I tried it before.

276
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:12,190
Oh, no, we did not extend this the second time you ever got in here.

277
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:17,319
I never tried it. I never got one. Well, the speaker notes. Yeah, I always just write down, you know, somehow.

278
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:23,590
Somehow some people can make it work. But I know I never write it down.

279
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,530
I just have to go. That's why. I'm sorry.

280
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:38,460
No, it's okay. I didn't write a lot of notes. Did you see the qualifying example?

281
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,150
You know, when he comes back, we could to see if we could start.

282
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:49,020
Yes. In that case, I would just go back to and let's.

283
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:55,930
That's it. That's easier to do once we have here in Brooklyn once again.

284
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:01,110
Well, that's a good problem. Yeah. Mm hmm.

285
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:15,510
Never mind. We don't have exams.

286
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:30,450
Okay. Which chocolate?

287
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:49,010
Special. What said was to try and produce goodwill.

288
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,180
I think that yeah yeah was.

289
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:59,300
I don't think he was saying he it this morning I think I would have been confused.

290
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:06,620
We can't confirm that ISIS has put some of the pictures that are going to be made there.

291
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:21,080
But so. And that picture was.

292
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:30,390
Okay. Ready? Yes. Okay.

293
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:37,290
Finally figure out who. Thank you.

294
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:42,470
Thank you. Go ahead.

295
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:46,720
Start. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Hi, everyone, I'm Suraj.

296
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:50,930
This is June. Andrew Thorburn and we are going to prison on mobility data capture.

297
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:57,470
Unfortunately, the dataset that we were using doesn't have mobility data after February 5th, 2022.

298
00:35:58,010 --> 00:36:02,570
And that is why we decided to include some mobility data from 2022.

299
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:07,820
So this is 19th November 2000, 2022, our friend June.

300
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:13,099
She was at the Michigan crime during on our Wolverines and we won.

301
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:19,639
It was an A in in we did win. So those who are doing this like I was is yeah.

302
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:25,550
Because there's no mobility date after, you know, like February and it's from November.

303
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:31,820
And then our dear friend Rita one had a very colorful trip to Peru. This is from Machu Picchu.

304
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:39,200
Obviously, we ordered the mobile data. Elvis, we are you know, we ordered them by date.

305
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:42,650
So that was 19. This is the 22nd of November.

306
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:48,800
And beautiful thing. And this is me old California trip.

307
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:53,450
This was when we were doing the drive through Big Sur 23rd of November.

308
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:57,200
And I won't abandon my students life.

309
00:36:58,430 --> 00:37:02,240
I don't know if you can see it, but there's like a waterfall. Yeah. Oh, yeah.

310
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:06,800
So this is all the mobility data that we could find for after February 5th.

311
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:13,610
Okay, back to our COVID 19 research.

312
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:19,020
So you know that COVID 19 life had taken so many lives in this world.

313
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:23,000
Among all the countries, the US had the highest number of cases and deaths.

314
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:29,819
So it's really important to look under the different factors that like a like for the COVID 19 transmission.

315
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:37,190
And we felt like mobility played a very important role in like COVID 19 transmission dynamics because close contact with people is a very,

316
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:40,280
extremely important factor in spreading the disease from one person to another.

317
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:45,980
So we need to see what is the effect on mobility on like COVID 19 transmission dynamics.

318
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:54,110
So the same thing as you didn't. Again, that mobility impacts the spread of the highly contagious COVID 19 virus.

319
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:59,990
We actually like got dumped in the data mobility data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics,

320
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:07,520
and we obtained the COVID 19 data and confirmed this data from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center that other groups as well.

321
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:12,079
Then the combined mobility and the mortality did that that we collected that

322
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:17,360
we made previously to be useful for researchers to find some special temporal

323
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:21,739
association between COVID mortality in government and the mobility in different

324
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:25,550
states and different counties of the US using what their motivation abilities.

325
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:32,840
So going back to the mobility data as we do one order dimension, we collected it from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics.

326
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:36,920
We had three, three, four, two counties, and the first date was January 2019.

327
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:41,270
And sadly, we don't have data after February it those in 2022.

328
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:46,040
In our case, the variables of interest were teams by distance and number of people staying at home and not staying at home.

329
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:54,680
Trips by distance was classified into four modes of transportation, driving rail, transit and air, and they included.

330
00:38:55,160 --> 00:39:02,120
So to be considered a trip, the person or the people needed to stay away from home for at least 10 minutes at an anonymized location.

331
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:08,660
And this trip people had a lot of subgroups, so they were categorized into less than one mile,

332
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:12,620
1 to 3 miles, 3 to 5 miles, depending on how far the person traveled.

333
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:20,390
But we decided to group all of them together, as that would be a variable that would be easier to interpret and to use in our analysis.

334
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:27,410
And the second variable is pretty easy to interpret in terms of how many people are not staying at home,

335
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:33,470
which means that they might have potentially like interactions with positive people.

336
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,110
So a pre-processing not it is perfect, but this data wasn't that bad, to be honest.

337
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:43,370
The data started from 1st January 2019, which we have called week zero.

338
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:50,060
We created week number numbers corresponding to this week zero. So every week after January 1st to January seven.

339
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:56,600
So this so week one would be January 8th to January 15th, 2019 or 8 to 14, 2019.

340
00:39:56,600 --> 00:40:02,659
And the only problem or the issue that we encountered here was that county level information was not available for each day of the week.

341
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:07,130
So for some counties there were like three or four days of data for the weeks.

342
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:11,960
So like we worked only by aggregating data for each week.

343
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:16,880
So like if we have an average count for each week, then it sort of mitigates the issue.

344
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:22,700
So that's what we did and that's how we got this mobility dataset, which has gone DFA for years,

345
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:28,730
which will be very useful in joining with any other potential datasets which might have information regarding COVID 19.

346
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:35,480
We have the county name the Street Postal Code, the week number where zero corresponds to January 1st through January 7th, 2019.

347
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:41,090
And then the the variables that I already mentioned are there and we also included state.

348
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:46,320
So that it's easier for people working with this to plot it using.

349
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:56,590
Okay. So we got the mortality data set from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center.

350
00:40:57,340 --> 00:41:04,150
This is a very reliable source for if you want data related to COVID deaths, cases, vaccination,

351
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:13,780
etc. They have been updating information on this on these areas by gathering data from over 260 sources,

352
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:18,190
including 180 local, state and federal U.S. agencies.

353
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:24,370
And they also have very convenient visualizations available on their website.

354
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:30,610
For instance, if you look at the U.S. map of COVID deaths and you.

355
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:37,770
This is an interactive plot. If you click on one of these counties, for example, this is the Allen County in Indiana.

356
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,679
Bill, you will see a quick summary.

357
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:52,930
Infographics on the health care, insurance facts, population, race, ethnicity, and also a summary of the number of cases and deaths in that county.

358
00:41:54,520 --> 00:42:00,790
So for our specific purpose, we wanted to look at COVID deaths and COVID cases.

359
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:05,290
So we took these two data sets.

360
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:13,250
Time Series COVID Deaths and time series COVID confirmed these two data sets from their GitHub repo.

361
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:16,989
So these two datasets have very similar formats.

362
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:28,299
They contain cumulative daily counts of COVID deaths or COVID confirmed cases over 3000 and 342 counties in the U.S. at the time of download,

363
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:34,300
it was between January 22nd, 2020 to November 14, 2022.

364
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:40,390
And the raw data set looks something like this include it includes PHE,

365
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:49,930
it includes the the FIPS code, the county, the county name, latitude and longitude,

366
00:42:50,530 --> 00:43:02,050
the population in that county, and then the daily counts of either deaths or confirmed cases in a in a wide format going from January 22nd,

367
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:05,650
2020, all the way to November 14th, 2020 to.

368
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:19,580
So we first removed missing entries. Some of these some of the some of the regions in these data sets have no available FIPS codes.

369
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:28,100
Those are typically places that are that have lower population and little to no cases or deaths.

370
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:39,830
So we removed those entries. And following the following the the format that Swaraj used to pre process the mortality, the mobility data,

371
00:43:40,130 --> 00:43:48,260
I used the same I used the same format to convert the dates to week number and we get the cumulative

372
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:56,630
weekly deaths or cases phi by directly taking the deaths in case counts at the beginning of each week.

373
00:43:57,020 --> 00:44:05,719
And then we also computed the weekly deaths in cases that the new weekly death in cases at each

374
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:11,780
week by taking the difference in cumulative death or case counts between two consecutive weeks.

375
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:19,850
So in some rare outlier cases there rock cumulative death and case counts are not strictly non decreasing.

376
00:44:20,210 --> 00:44:25,700
So we manually set the weekly new deaths and cases for those particular cases to zero.

377
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:35,450
Also, in some very rare outlier cases, the weekly new deaths and case counts were unrealistically high,

378
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:42,680
much, much higher than any neighboring observations, which seemed unrealistic.

379
00:44:42,690 --> 00:44:53,180
So for these cases, we smoothed the observation over over the previous two weeks and and and the subsequent two weeks.

380
00:44:54,730 --> 00:44:58,840
Did you report the methods you used for distributing this?

381
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:05,330
Sort of. You just seem to smile, which is like we just do it like it's like a moving average.

382
00:45:05,390 --> 00:45:08,840
The other thing, they report it.

383
00:45:09,410 --> 00:45:13,590
Yeah, we, we, we, we get. So this is something that we observed on Friday.

384
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:17,810
Yeah, but we weren't getting the draft, so this was like very last minute that we made the changes, so.

385
00:45:17,850 --> 00:45:19,540
Yeah. Yeah. But. Okay.

386
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:31,250
So finally we combine the more the mobility data and the mortality data set on the weekly and county level to create the final data data set.

387
00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:37,310
And this is a data dictionary of the data set that we use to do our exploratory analysis,

388
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:44,690
including so the variables include the county zip codes, the county name, the state postal code.

389
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:50,419
We also put in the the jiggy plot code for state and county.

390
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:57,140
So if you wanted to make a plot, you can directly plug these two variables into into the function.

391
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:01,790
Also latitude and longitude of that of the county.

392
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:09,110
The week number, which, as Siraj explained, is the number of weeks that have elapsed since January 1st,

393
00:46:09,110 --> 00:46:14,120
2019, the date which is the start date of each corresponding week,

394
00:46:15,050 --> 00:46:21,440
and the population of people staying at home, which is the total number of people staying at home during that week,

395
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:26,960
as well as the total number of people not staying at home during during the corresponding week,

396
00:46:27,770 --> 00:46:32,840
the total number of trips taken by people during that week, the poppy,

397
00:46:32,870 --> 00:46:35,299
the total population of people during the week,

398
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:45,350
and also and the proportion of people that are not staying at home over the total population for that week.

399
00:46:45,890 --> 00:46:52,820
And also the cumulative, cumulative and weekly deaths and cumulative and weekly COVID cases.

400
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:57,959
So order teams will replace the same. You should use the same data from Johns Hopkins.

401
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:03,200
Yeah, yeah. But you only collect about data up to February 15, 2022.

402
00:47:03,230 --> 00:47:09,350
Right. Like on my. Yes, well go online but you clean up this confirmed cases and deaths separately.

403
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:19,159
Yeah. For the entire dataset. Okay. So order teams if they want to analyze this confirmed cases and mortality and it can use your data.

404
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:26,360
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Because then some there was some data, we analyzed it and we found that there were like for Florida itself,

405
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:29,419
there were a few counties with abnormally high number for some. Yeah.

406
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:33,260
So it was like totally the graph was looking like it was a smooth curve and then like a spike.

407
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:38,690
And so we, we smoothed out that spike and there was no like potential of cause for the spike.

408
00:47:38,690 --> 00:47:42,140
Like the timeline that we were looking at. There were no COVID outbreaks or anything.

409
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:48,140
So people are aware of this sort of outliers there and so that if they want to use the data that they can use.

410
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:52,100
Okay, thanks. Yeah. Okay.

411
00:47:52,640 --> 00:48:00,140
So using this combined year, let's say that we need some preliminary analysis so we know that COVID 19 mortality doesn't start from 2020,

412
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:06,890
but our morbidity does this study did from 2019. But to combine the two datasets together, we started our analysis on 20, 20,

413
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:15,920
one year and in three parts like 2020 special and 2021 and 2022 like to see the official heterogeneity among the different states.

414
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,520
So our data is county level one thing before he goes on.

415
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:26,479
So we so far for all the temporal plots after this week, zero corresponds to the first week after emerging.

416
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:32,060
So it's like January 23, 2020 to 2020.

417
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:37,129
Yeah. Yeah. So this is like the special plot for just 2020.

418
00:48:37,130 --> 00:48:40,280
So how we got the spatial plot, like we aggregated values.

419
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:43,399
So this is like the spatial parts of the states we did not do over counties.

420
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:46,850
We just felt like visualizing over whole counties.

421
00:48:46,850 --> 00:48:51,770
It was like become cumbersome. So we just aggregated over all the counties in a particular state.

422
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:58,040
And over the whole year of 2020, so far, like we did the sum of the different variables,

423
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:02,780
like the number of trips, number of restrooms by week, number of COVID mortality.

424
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:07,760
We just do the same over all of 2020 in all of the counties of a particular state.

425
00:49:08,810 --> 00:49:14,209
And the observations that we saw here, like if you see this is like the proportion of people not staying at home,

426
00:49:14,210 --> 00:49:18,650
like for states like Texas, for Florida, for New York, like,

427
00:49:18,650 --> 00:49:22,700
you know, so you can see that in the Midwest, in the Southeast, despite height,

428
00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:30,709
so highest for the southeast, the excess followed by the Midway states in for the number of trips.

429
00:49:30,710 --> 00:49:33,680
It has some distinct background, as you can see, for California, for Texas,

430
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:37,940
for New York and for Florida, it is distinctively height like and for the others.

431
00:49:38,210 --> 00:49:45,590
And also you can see so if our number of deaths and number of groups, they have very like similar type of spatial pattern in 2020.

432
00:49:46,010 --> 00:49:50,120
Like for California, it is like high for Texas, it is high for New York,

433
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:55,310
it is high for Florida is also high that they have a similar spatial backgrounds for number of days and number of groups.

434
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:06,370
For 2021, the proportion of people staying not at home had almost a similar special burden as 2020 for a number of trips.

435
00:50:06,390 --> 00:50:14,640
It changed a bit like and for the number of deaths, the number of deaths in like New York and Florida now dropped a bit.

436
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:18,180
The number of deaths in Texas and California still remained the flight high,

437
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:26,930
but previously that in New York and Florida's high about it decreased a bit during 2021 and for 2022.

438
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:30,239
Also, we also observed the spatial heterogeneity of our states.

439
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:35,280
We can see and again for like California, Texas, it is high number of claims,

440
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:40,200
the number of deaths and again the pattern for like it is remained the same more or less.

441
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:44,099
And you can see like the number of creeps in the scale of number of people is like

442
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:48,540
five to deported to the border each year because for 2022 we have very little data.

443
00:50:48,810 --> 00:50:54,360
But for the other ones it is like 5 to 5 one nine because we have very listed corresponding

444
00:50:54,360 --> 00:51:00,490
to your you do well apparently those states basically our most popularized stickers.

445
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:07,620
Yeah. Yeah. So we do have probably adjusted for the population size that probably will look a little bit different.

446
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:14,850
Yeah, right. So for example, number two per person or something divided by the population,

447
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:19,560
you can see that that California, Texas and New York have some data for that.

448
00:51:19,590 --> 00:51:24,650
All of these states have the highest population, so we can just divided by the population and see.

449
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:33,670
Right. So I think that this absolute numbers are certainly very I mean, this probably going to also be a function of their I mean,

450
00:51:33,870 --> 00:51:41,610
that drive the number of COVID deaths is also because you have more population sort of observe on average more of that.

451
00:51:41,670 --> 00:51:47,159
Right. And I think you can also see that from the proportion graph that California is like the proportion of people not staying at home.

452
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:51,790
For California it is like late seventies allotment. Yeah. Dividing by the total number of people.

453
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:55,380
So Boston, it's it's clear stand off, right?

454
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:59,940
Yeah right it is. To a ratio. Yeah. Again for New York, although it is like less than other states.

455
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:08,000
So it is showing something different here. Yeah. So this is a switch temporal gov blockade over all the weeks.

456
00:52:08,010 --> 00:52:11,880
Like all the years together, like 20, 20, 2021 and 2022.

457
00:52:12,090 --> 00:52:16,020
Like this is the average number of cases, the proportion of people not staying at home and this is the number of deaths.

458
00:52:16,350 --> 00:52:20,490
So we expect that far. This is a national level plot like for the whole of us.

459
00:52:20,910 --> 00:52:25,140
Like we can see distinct like the peaks here, like corresponding to different waves.

460
00:52:25,950 --> 00:52:29,749
So far there is not a particular pattern for number more people,

461
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:34,649
the proportion of people it first decreases with random fluctuations, then it increases suddenly.

462
00:52:34,650 --> 00:52:36,360
At this point of the year, that number,

463
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:45,150
maybe the lockdowns restrictions were like there are no lockdown restrictions that were taken back and those things to a number of

464
00:52:45,150 --> 00:52:50,940
lives in including at this moment and also see the number of proportion of people not being at home also decreased at this point.

465
00:52:53,590 --> 00:52:57,030
A similar trend was seen. We also plotted just for Michigan.

466
00:52:57,030 --> 00:53:05,030
Similar trend was seen for Michigan as well. Like the trend was similar, but the big side and those things would be different for Michigan National,

467
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:09,360
obviously, but it almost had a similar type of patterns we saw.

468
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:18,879
Okay. So we also wanted to look at the correlation between mortality and mobility and mobility variables.

469
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:31,390
So in this plot, in this graph, we looked at the correlation between proportion of people not staying at home as p number of trips.

470
00:53:31,690 --> 00:53:43,960
That's T and the number of deaths. So this all these variables are averaged over 2020 to 20 20 to 2022 at the state level.

471
00:53:44,650 --> 00:53:52,719
So first, we look at the correlation between the proportion of people not staying at home and the number of trips.

472
00:53:52,720 --> 00:54:01,150
And there's quite a high correlation between the two variables throughout the states, in the United States.

473
00:54:01,150 --> 00:54:03,130
And that's that's to be expected.

474
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:17,340
And when we move on to the correlation between between a mobility variables and the number the number of deaths, we can see a spatial fact.

475
00:54:17,530 --> 00:54:27,010
We can see spatial heterogeneity in the correlation patterns between between mobility and mortality variables.

476
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:38,200
So for instance, in, in certain states like, like in in Maine, Nebraska, in Maine, Oregon, Kentucky.

477
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:41,680
And I can't remember which state this is.

478
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:48,879
And Oklahoma, these these places show a higher correlation,

479
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:54,520
a higher correlation between the proportion of people not staying at home and the number of deaths.

480
00:54:54,520 --> 00:55:00,340
And the same pattern is repeated for the number of trips and the number of deaths.

481
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:08,350
And in certain other states, the correlation between mortality and mobility variables are negative.

482
00:55:08,350 --> 00:55:18,520
For instance, that, for instance, in California, in Illinois, and this is this is Nebraska.

483
00:55:22,210 --> 00:55:26,440
Yeah. Maybe this is something to do with the compliance of vaccination.

484
00:55:27,070 --> 00:55:35,799
Maybe California is better for the vaccination given the state outside of the wars and they have higher temperature

485
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:44,210
and they have more space and even outdoors and they have higher vaccination coverage so that they probably have less.

486
00:55:44,710 --> 00:55:47,730
So, yeah, there's like a lot of special interest. Yeah.

487
00:55:50,540 --> 00:55:52,660
You have about Three and a Half Men. Okay. Okay.

488
00:55:54,560 --> 00:56:00,110
So these are like some of the dietitians we're thinking about for the final project, like and we are sitting here, we're just analyzing.

489
00:56:00,110 --> 00:56:07,159
I did them in two counties of Michigan, just in Michigan data and we are planning the mortality and the response variable like and for covariates and

490
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:12,889
thinking date the week number of weeks as a go evaluate mobility then other coverage like racial distribution,

491
00:56:12,890 --> 00:56:16,160
RNA, Asian and others like we'll think about from the other data sets were thinking

492
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:20,780
about for some of the plants at first doing some preliminary spatial models we

493
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:26,030
don't accounting for any like temporal things then and if we do for some important

494
00:56:26,030 --> 00:56:30,340
models without any special heterogeneity and finally they show temporal model,

495
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:34,760
we are like incorporating both spatial and temporal effects together,

496
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:42,530
like for we are also planning like we're planning to do something like the time getting reproduction number as the response variable.

497
00:56:42,530 --> 00:56:49,909
But I was thinking that it can be possible that a time between reproduction number after some time can become very similar for different county.

498
00:56:49,910 --> 00:56:57,560
So it may not be a very heterogeneous response variable for different counties, so it may not have a good team to see if we like.

499
00:56:57,950 --> 00:57:01,969
But these are some of the ideas we're having for the final project we can discuss with you on this Thursday.

500
00:57:01,970 --> 00:57:10,280
Like what I thought the plans. We can quickly respond when you are not interested in looking at the countries of the country.

501
00:57:11,390 --> 00:57:17,400
Only the 83 countries like probably you have see a lot more heterogeneity variability.

502
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:20,820
Well this 3300 or some of the countries like you.

503
00:57:21,230 --> 00:57:24,200
Yeah at first we are just planning that we can develop models like earnings

504
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:27,229
more like it will take less time to run models for the counties and Michigan.

505
00:57:27,230 --> 00:57:32,230
So we started down and we can just go forward with the whole country also because based on the correlation plots,

506
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:38,380
we've found a lot of features energy like spatial that there's unity. So we wanted to maybe just do the Michigan one,

507
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:43,430
then we can just if you had the code ready for that and if you don't count it, then we can go forward and extend it to look.

508
00:57:43,430 --> 00:57:47,989
I think the last point is more of like how we start to start like the some of the features starting.

509
00:57:47,990 --> 00:57:52,790
I would think that probably is interesting to have a comparison come to with the state.

510
00:57:52,910 --> 00:57:56,959
Right. Some word I can contrast California or something like that.

511
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:02,570
We can do one of the systems, right. Or some I saw is like like somewhere like for now or something.

512
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:06,950
Yeah. To, to really see the contrast. Yeah. It will be interesting to do that.

513
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:14,989
Yeah. So these are and also like this plot is like for like all the years together from 2020, 2022,

514
00:58:14,990 --> 00:58:21,680
we feel like it that this the scenario would have been a bit different if we have analyzed like each year separately like 20,

515
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:24,950
20, 21, then the correlation may have been a bit different.

516
00:58:24,950 --> 00:58:29,269
We feel like because we saw that a special pattern for the number of groups and

517
00:58:29,270 --> 00:58:33,349
the number of deaths were very similar when we analyzed with here separately.

518
00:58:33,350 --> 00:58:37,549
So maybe there's like a lag figure, a little bit mystical. Yeah, some works better. So these are things which yeah.

519
00:58:37,550 --> 00:58:41,480
So we are thinking I'm not doing any like naive models like just virus are

520
00:58:41,570 --> 00:58:46,910
correlation but going forward with some deeper and more special computer models

521
00:58:46,910 --> 00:58:54,630
to see what is definition heterogeneity in everything I clear see there's a gap between the richness of data versus number of plots you can provide,

522
00:58:54,650 --> 00:58:58,820
right? Yeah. So, so probably we need a Hollywood director.

523
00:58:58,820 --> 00:59:02,790
Tell us how to shoot a movie about the whole dynamics.

524
00:59:03,170 --> 00:59:06,830
So. So you're able to see actually a lot of more detail that data.

525
00:59:07,430 --> 00:59:13,879
That's quite a challenge. And you have very rich data, but you only have very limited space to display data.

526
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:20,780
I think so. So I don't know, like maybe this is a very important research problem.

527
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:26,590
Know. Thank you very much. Thank you. Questions from audience. Yeah, you're there.

528
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:29,950
So I just had a question with the novelty.

529
00:59:30,230 --> 00:59:38,990
He saw it in the calculator. So were you saying that that for Florida, specifically some counties of Florida.

530
00:59:38,990 --> 00:59:46,969
Yes. Yes. But were you saying that the weekly death count was abnormal or that the fact that

531
00:59:46,970 --> 00:59:51,770
the file wasn't cumulative for those counties like the the spike really high,

532
00:59:52,550 --> 00:59:54,320
the cumulative and then go back down.

533
00:59:55,890 --> 01:00:05,180
Let me go back close for some two weeks and that the cumulative counts had that there was a spike around week 158.

534
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:09,950
All right. Week 158 and which date is that? Which week is that.

535
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:14,630
What end of 2020 were.

536
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:21,150
So 158 if we start from January 1st, 2000, 19, 20, 20 and 22 on most others.

537
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:28,400
Yeah, one of the counties in Florida had there was, there was a huge spike and then went back down.

538
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:31,370
So the cumulative component back then. Yes. Okay.

539
01:00:31,910 --> 01:00:41,620
Because I was thinking the other one with the mortality and case data, sometimes specific counties or states release them in aggregate once a week.

540
01:00:41,630 --> 01:00:49,460
So it wouldn't be surprising if a county hasn't reported mortality data for three weeks and then one week they're reporting all of the passing.

541
01:00:50,570 --> 01:00:56,150
So that's the not the non-cumulative. One could have very gigantic debt increases.

542
01:00:56,870 --> 01:01:03,650
So in this case, I guess that like doing a moving average over over the weeks would have been an acceptable choice.

543
01:01:04,610 --> 01:01:12,040
Yeah. Just to do it before, two weeks after and just it just proves what everything that we did,

544
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:17,900
that's for all of the whole of doing it has to be done to be considered for that particular week.

545
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:22,660
Yeah. Questions.

546
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:31,960
Okay. Good. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.

547
01:01:35,290 --> 01:01:47,430
Send me the slides. Remember you. The last team lost person to person.

548
01:01:48,390 --> 01:01:52,000
Team one say.

549
01:02:30,330 --> 01:02:37,440
So while they're preparing this slice, I just want to remind you, I mean, I shall not remind you,

550
01:02:37,470 --> 01:02:46,170
just bring up for discussion, you know, that nature has a very special sort of journal called Scientific Data.

551
01:02:46,710 --> 01:02:50,970
It publishes different types of papers for data set.

552
01:02:51,480 --> 01:03:00,900
The weight is one type is data descriptor, basically just published a paper diet, introduce a database.

553
01:03:01,950 --> 01:03:08,100
So of course, I know there's a lot of work that we need to do if we want to put all the pieces together,

554
01:03:08,610 --> 01:03:17,040
like you harmonize all the countries and give it a little bit description what the data is, well, like summary statistics and so on.

555
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:20,040
So for now you don't need to do data analysis.

556
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:29,370
You just describe what the dataset, the impact factor is somewhere on a 9.0 or so, it's all of the data.

557
01:03:30,070 --> 01:03:36,210
So while optional can have 18 authors for that paper and if you want to go for that.

558
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:43,680
And so when there's no rush to finish up this, but if you really want to go for that direction,

559
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:49,670
have a, you know, paper for nature scientific data, we can give it a why.

560
01:03:49,910 --> 01:03:57,720
I mean, each team will contribute like two pieces or something, but so I kind of sent them to give or send to their I like it.

561
01:03:58,230 --> 01:04:05,130
I was viewers a couple of times for for this journal particular for Kobe data.

562
01:04:05,610 --> 01:04:14,510
So I think that the dataset we have is quite a comprehensive having all sorts of socio environmental and, you know,

563
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:22,920
things and you kind of you can make sort of variables that probably people want to use it for on the research.

564
01:04:23,580 --> 01:04:32,660
Yeah. Anyway, that's a option that you can consider. You can also google that journal i so if you like that.

565
01:04:32,900 --> 01:04:40,219
Okay. It's called scientific data. Okay.

566
01:04:40,220 --> 01:04:48,440
Story time. We are team one and we're going to briefly go through our data capture and exploration of the ratio distribution.

567
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:58,010
And our first goal, the data source we use. The data were taken from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2020 Census redistricting data,

568
01:04:58,670 --> 01:05:06,770
which is the latest version that we can find for the rate for the ratio distribution and the dataset covers the following variables.

569
01:05:07,190 --> 01:05:15,200
The first one is your I.D. So instead of the FIPS code, the U.S. Census Bureau uses the grid for it,

570
01:05:16,340 --> 01:05:24,110
uses the grid that uniquely identifies all of the administrative and statistical geographic areas for the tabulated data.

571
01:05:24,890 --> 01:05:28,850
Unfortunately, I can I didn't find the newest documentation for this,

572
01:05:29,210 --> 01:05:34,100
and it seems like the U.S. Census Bureau has updated the geo ID formatting recently,

573
01:05:34,850 --> 01:05:39,740
but here I still put their own documentation in 2013 here for a reference.

574
01:05:40,250 --> 01:05:44,600
And actually after matching the FIPS code based on the county name and state name,

575
01:05:44,870 --> 01:05:50,720
it turns out that the last five digits of the jihadi are exactly the same as the fifth code.

576
01:05:51,020 --> 01:05:58,880
So probably next time when we are using the data from the Census Bureau, we can directly extract the FIPS code from the due I.D.

577
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:07,639
Oh. Oh. So the data set provides the geographic area name in a formatting like county, county name, comma,

578
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:18,860
state name and in total, this dataset covers 52 states and 3217 counties all about compare with the CDC COVID 19 data.

579
01:06:19,220 --> 01:06:22,970
There are seven states missing, though most of them are islands.

580
01:06:22,970 --> 01:06:30,620
So I guess there should be no huge impact on any downstream analysis besides this.

581
01:06:30,620 --> 01:06:36,830
The does not cover very detailed population information, including the total population,

582
01:06:37,130 --> 01:06:42,970
Hispanic or Latino, black, Hispanic or Latino or Hispanic or Latino population.

583
01:06:42,980 --> 01:06:48,050
Long and here along means that they only have one racial identity.

584
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:58,340
And we also have that kind of information for blacks, for black or African American, African Indian and Alaska, Native, Asian,

585
01:06:58,610 --> 01:07:08,870
Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander and population, with two or more races and with specific combinations are also included.

586
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:13,850
And we could potentially combine some of those groups together when conducting analysis.

587
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:23,330
This variable might be like very confusing at first glance. So at least three questions here to help us being a better understanding of them

588
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:28,850
and the three questions that are also included in the dictionary of our dataset.

589
01:07:32,450 --> 01:07:35,810
I'm going to talk about a little bit about the data cleaning.

590
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:45,530
So the major goal is to get the FIPS coding our data set and make sure it actually name is consistent with the CDC data set in our original data.

591
01:07:46,190 --> 01:07:51,410
There are some where characters in accounting names, for example, are shown here.

592
01:07:51,950 --> 01:07:55,610
We can see some square use in qualifying since old.

593
01:07:56,060 --> 01:08:02,240
So after changing the encoding those we are characters turning to separation singles that were

594
01:08:02,540 --> 01:08:08,570
there were originally supposed to be accents or I should say the symbols for the tooth here.

595
01:08:09,890 --> 01:08:14,030
Like the, like the words in the brackets is the correct one.

596
01:08:14,750 --> 01:08:21,680
Oh, last thing. Snider, too, continues from the CDC data Saginaw does from Puerto Rico.

597
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:27,280
I mean, yeah, yeah. Most of them are probably the name of the country.

598
01:08:27,310 --> 01:08:35,810
So yeah. So we have to manually track all of them to make sure they can be matched with the 0606 code.

599
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:45,460
Oh. And just as Peter mentioned, most of the name issues arose from the state Paul Rico And finally we must have six counties,

600
01:08:45,470 --> 01:08:49,550
state and county names based on one our package use map.

601
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:56,000
But there are few census areas that haven't been covered in this package, which also requires a manual check.

602
01:08:56,580 --> 01:09:01,700
Oh, and then at the end, you are going to talk about our exploration based on this there.

603
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:16,550
So this is a table, one of our primary data and travel shows the summary statistics of the COVID 19 data and the rest data at the state level.

604
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:19,910
Our analysis is primarily based on 50 states.

605
01:09:20,150 --> 01:09:25,490
After seeing how states the mean proportion of black population in the US is

606
01:09:25,490 --> 01:09:34,310
around 10% and the mean proportion of the white population in USA is around 66%.

607
01:09:34,850 --> 01:09:49,249
And we love our I think that the total case total deaths and so vaccination we suppose here is the is the data from the last day

608
01:09:49,250 --> 01:10:01,200
of the 2021 and the mean total is around 1 million and the 60,000 and the mean total deaths is around 60,000 across Austria,

609
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:11,420
across all states. This is a federal one of which come, which is the heat map for the cumulative cases and the deaths.

610
01:10:13,310 --> 01:10:20,570
And fewer white indicates the distribution of the cumulative cases and deaths by states at the end of 2021,

611
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:27,290
according to this plus, among the contiguous United States,

612
01:10:27,620 --> 01:10:39,380
the north eastern part of the states and the West Coast states have relatively lower number of cumulative cases and deaths per 100,000 population,

613
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:52,490
while also west, north central states and the South Atlantic states have the higher number of cumulative cases per 100,000 population.

614
01:10:52,880 --> 01:11:02,270
So this is actually data before the availability of vaccination rate is 2021, 12 December,

615
01:11:03,770 --> 01:11:09,680
right after I think it's official record because the vaccination and vaccines are insured.

616
01:11:09,830 --> 01:11:13,909
So this is before December 31st, 2021.

617
01:11:13,910 --> 01:11:28,120
Author. So vaccines are available in the middle of December 2021, 2024, May 2021.

618
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:32,200
Oh, okay. So we have one year.

619
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:39,790
Okay. For that. I see. I was like, You know what?

620
01:11:41,730 --> 01:11:47,240
So I just kind of like, oh, yes, my third stop is last year.

621
01:11:47,330 --> 01:11:53,930
Okay. I remember I had my third like booster like December last year, correct?

622
01:11:54,350 --> 01:11:59,240
Yeah. And you think that they had until the last day of 2021?

623
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:09,830
North Dakota has the highest number of COVID 19 cases, while the Vermont has the lowest number of COVID 19 cases.

624
01:12:10,220 --> 01:12:21,500
Meanwhile, the total death in Mississippi is the highest, while the total deaths in Vermont is the lowest outright this year hit to,

625
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:30,050
not surprisingly, shows the same pattern, which indicates that the states with more cases are tend to have more deaths.

626
01:12:31,730 --> 01:12:39,200
Do you have a closer look at the potential association between the total number of cases and the ratio distribution,

627
01:12:39,470 --> 01:12:47,240
or divided the states into two groups states with total number of cases louder than the media and lower than the media.

628
01:12:47,510 --> 01:12:53,630
Here is a bar chart showing the difference off ratio distribution among these two groups.

629
01:12:54,110 --> 01:13:02,240
And now we can see that there is a huge difference between these two groups amongst black population percentage,

630
01:13:02,540 --> 01:13:12,980
which give us a guess that states with high black proportion tend to have more cases and deaths per 100,000 population.

631
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:20,870
And we also do a summary statistic stratified by the groups as described above.

632
01:13:21,410 --> 01:13:27,080
And here is the updated stratified case, table one.

633
01:13:27,620 --> 01:13:40,040
And according to the p value here, there is a there is a statistically significant difference amongst black black population percentage between

634
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:47,960
these two groups at point of five a significance level which provide to us another evidence of our guess.

635
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:58,450
From the other side. We also divides the states into two groups based on the black population percentage.

636
01:13:59,620 --> 01:14:07,630
I'm in the states with black population percentage less than or equal to the median and greater than the median.

637
01:14:07,900 --> 01:14:19,719
And still there is a there is an obvious difference in total case between these two groups which matches our previous findings and provided

638
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:31,690
evidence of our guess that states with higher black proportion tend to have more cases and the deaths per 100,000 population and not that severe.

639
01:14:31,690 --> 01:14:38,410
A few dramatic increase among the officer emotional time,

640
01:14:39,370 --> 01:14:55,330
which indicates that there might be some reason for the increase from December 2020 to February 2021 and January 20 and January 2022 to February 2022.

641
01:14:56,980 --> 01:15:08,139
And actually, when we look back to the Time series plots for total number of cases in United States from February 2021,

642
01:15:08,140 --> 01:15:14,740
November 2022, we could find there are sure significant growth as well.

643
01:15:15,310 --> 01:15:23,590
Comparing the information reflected by this plot and what we have for the timeline of COVID 19,

644
01:15:24,310 --> 01:15:32,500
actually, the first the first growth seems to be the result of the outbreak of our variant.

645
01:15:32,890 --> 01:15:37,300
And the third had might be caused by the outbreak of the all new coronavirus.

646
01:15:37,450 --> 01:15:49,870
And if such virus in the United States, I think the first one is more likely the relaxation of according to because the vaccination becomes available.

647
01:15:49,870 --> 01:15:59,350
So people tend to say, oh, okay, I have a some kind of thing that, you know, to help me to fight against the virus like people have been,

648
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:05,730
you know, in this sort of social distancing or some restrictions for a while.

649
01:16:05,740 --> 01:16:11,420
But probably there was a fatigue. It was a compliance of restrictions, though.

650
01:16:11,710 --> 01:16:16,930
And when vaccine becomes available, there's a actually, it's a winter time, right?

651
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:24,340
So that people tend to relax themselves and start to move around so they get more infections during that time.

652
01:16:25,180 --> 01:16:32,709
And so I'm going to be talking about the spatial analysis of the racial distribution.

653
01:16:32,710 --> 01:16:38,460
So before that, does anyone know how often does the Census Bureau do things this frequency?

654
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:52,179
Two years. Exactly. So that will go so that the apples are in a difficult position because the latest census data is from 2020.

655
01:16:52,180 --> 01:16:55,270
So we don't have data from 2020 to 2022.

656
01:16:55,510 --> 01:17:01,930
And the Census Bureau said over the past ten years, the structure of station situation has dramatically changed.

657
01:17:02,290 --> 01:17:06,609
But without a better source of more reliable data sources,

658
01:17:06,610 --> 01:17:15,189
we have to assume that the racial distribution is constant from 2020 and this is the overlook of what it is, and I'm not going to read it out.

659
01:17:15,190 --> 01:17:21,310
But basically you can see a pattern for each race across the nation.

660
01:17:21,580 --> 01:17:26,330
And the color here doesn't mean anything. It's it's for better visualizing.

661
01:17:26,650 --> 01:17:30,730
Probably migration will be very minimal we think. Window of two years.

662
01:17:30,850 --> 01:17:38,440
There's some reason why since superior does like the survey for everything, number one probably is very expensive to do it.

663
01:17:38,830 --> 01:17:44,170
Secondly probably the of the migration is a very short period of time.

664
01:17:44,740 --> 01:17:48,819
Exactly. So so yes.

665
01:17:48,820 --> 01:17:58,600
So when looking at data, we've been struggling with how to how to better model or export association because we try to do the more as I.

666
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:00,190
But since we have categorical data,

667
01:18:00,190 --> 01:18:12,820
we have the options first we can do and for each race like say I log of the rate for for each race but we we think that's less informative.

668
01:18:13,090 --> 01:18:23,020
And we also proposed to use a very new method called Elsa if in case you want to do categorical like spatial association.

669
01:18:23,020 --> 01:18:27,370
But we didn't present the data here because it requires more investigation of the assumptions,

670
01:18:27,370 --> 01:18:36,490
because also we need to put a weight on each pair of the category so we cannot assume equal the similarity here or so.

671
01:18:36,820 --> 01:18:41,260
But in case you want to do categorical, that's the package that's actually available in Korean.

672
01:18:41,740 --> 01:18:49,240
So before so like we read a lot of literature and they reported that race itself can be a.

673
01:18:49,640 --> 01:18:58,000
Exposure for before for COVID for different reasons, because it could be a there could be a lot of mediators say.

674
01:18:58,390 --> 01:19:04,670
Physical race can can be can be populated in a densely populated area.

675
01:19:04,670 --> 01:19:10,520
So there's a lot of like human interaction or there's going to be a lot of burden of comorbidity.

676
01:19:10,940 --> 01:19:20,749
But we've been thinking, what is the better? Is there a better way to represent the race in terms in terms of the COVID pandemic?

677
01:19:20,750 --> 01:19:30,620
So we did our homework and we found that this diversity index is quite often used and it's recommended by the Census Bureau as well.

678
01:19:30,620 --> 01:19:37,009
So if you work that each are, there's a calculator for that to actually model the productivity,

679
01:19:37,010 --> 01:19:40,720
productivity of your team based on the mix of your races.

680
01:19:40,760 --> 01:19:46,339
And the formula is quite simple. So it's bounded between zero one and so say everyone is from one race,

681
01:19:46,340 --> 01:19:51,560
then you're di zero is the higher it is, the stronger the diverse diversity it is.

682
01:19:51,950 --> 01:19:55,690
There is an and here is just a picture.

683
01:19:55,700 --> 01:20:04,939
Well, I don't stand up so so page square and how we calculate is zero was where we're sorry so that was the proportions.

684
01:20:04,940 --> 01:20:11,149
So like right so there's eight. So that's corresponding to the way we called our race before.

685
01:20:11,150 --> 01:20:17,299
So first all this was for county level were polygon or is this this DI is defined

686
01:20:17,300 --> 01:20:21,720
for four or you get a hot polygon or something like county or something.

687
01:20:21,860 --> 01:20:28,189
It's it's for any any level you want basically each and every polygon.

688
01:20:28,190 --> 01:20:31,850
Right. So yes. So you look at those ratios and squared them.

689
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:35,470
Yeah. Well then one minus stuff. Right.

690
01:20:35,570 --> 01:20:39,049
Copy all that in your dataset. Yes, we did.

691
01:20:39,050 --> 01:20:43,430
So that's what I'm going to. Oh I see. So, so is available in the dataset.

692
01:20:44,180 --> 01:20:48,379
Mm. No you can only need us to keep your total self.

693
01:20:48,380 --> 01:20:51,620
Did not. What in the data is that. Okay.

694
01:20:51,860 --> 01:20:57,620
Well I probably can you update your data set with this die because I think this a very meaningful way to.

695
01:20:57,800 --> 01:21:05,540
Yeah definitely definitely this looks like the rural index run a model like you the multilevel this sort of the racial groups or and

696
01:21:05,540 --> 01:21:13,940
that's most of the groups and you have this diversity index that could be a very useful summary of variable to be could eat them all.

697
01:21:14,090 --> 01:21:18,100
Yeah this is the division reduction basically. Right. So yeah.

698
01:21:18,170 --> 01:21:21,409
Think opt in your data and put that into the dataset.

699
01:21:21,410 --> 01:21:27,979
People can use that and in terms of why that's important and just going to make an example.

700
01:21:27,980 --> 01:21:31,070
So I'm not sure if you look at the guidebook to the New York City.

701
01:21:31,310 --> 01:21:39,080
So basically this is like I took a few paper pictures. So they mentioned that in New York City there are eight wonderful ethnicity,

702
01:21:40,130 --> 01:21:47,030
minority neighborhoods like Koreatown, little Aristo, Chinatown, little Guyana.

703
01:21:47,030 --> 01:21:57,109
So that just means that just reminds us that the data we just calculated could be an indicator because for Taco Bell,

704
01:21:57,110 --> 01:22:00,140
because it could be proxy for how people interact with each other.

705
01:22:00,290 --> 01:22:06,500
For example, like, say, Chinese people want to go to Chinatown for for Chinese food or vice versa.

706
01:22:07,610 --> 01:22:10,970
So again, this is our guess.

707
01:22:11,030 --> 01:22:19,849
We need to do more research on that. But but we we think that diversity could impact the incidence of COVID in two ways.

708
01:22:19,850 --> 01:22:23,929
One is the social pattern, where there's the like isolation by ethnicity,

709
01:22:23,930 --> 01:22:34,129
where people have less interaction but reverse way it could be like there could be more Internet like international import of the disease,

710
01:22:34,130 --> 01:22:44,420
for example, like a more diverse place could have more international like, say, flights, which could have like international COVID cases.

711
01:22:44,840 --> 01:22:51,230
So again, these, these need like more literature review to to have a like foundation for these.

712
01:22:51,530 --> 01:22:58,910
But with, with or without that those gases, it isn't hard to look at the general, the distribution for our states.

713
01:22:59,180 --> 01:23:06,079
So again remember this bounded between zero and one and the greener it is, the higher it is.

714
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:14,090
So we can see that on state level, there's the clear pattern where the borders stay East Coast, West Coast or someone board.

715
01:23:15,230 --> 01:23:21,620
They have a higher diversity index versus the England, which is relatively lower.

716
01:23:23,390 --> 01:23:25,760
And these are just some statistics.

717
01:23:26,420 --> 01:23:35,360
So the the least diverse state would be Maine, followed by Western Virginia, and the most diverse states would be Hawaii, followed by California.

718
01:23:35,690 --> 01:23:42,739
And again, we calculated more by taking a log and we use different ways to calculate neighborhoods.

719
01:23:42,740 --> 01:23:46,850
One is the inverse distance and the other one is the Queen.

720
01:23:47,060 --> 01:23:50,880
The first one is more conservative. And which gives her a bigger problem.

721
01:23:50,890 --> 01:23:54,000
But either way, it's significant.

722
01:23:54,600 --> 01:24:04,739
And again, since we mentioned that with we did some hypothesis that the index could be due to some immigrations,

723
01:24:04,740 --> 01:24:11,070
and we look further look at the county level by for four biggest immigration states.

724
01:24:11,220 --> 01:24:18,420
And you can see that the patterns are actually quite different. For example, for California, we can see irradiation from this area.

725
01:24:18,510 --> 01:24:28,140
So so that's the extent of one valley, San Jose, where lots of Asian immigrants there are doing like programmers.

726
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:32,340
And for Texas, it's going to have a stronger pattern.

727
01:24:32,820 --> 01:24:40,500
And for Newark, actually, there's also radiation from the Long Island and therefore Florida, again, it's mixed up.

728
01:24:40,680 --> 01:24:44,260
So I listed here for most eyes.

729
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:50,069
So that just means that even though the kind of level the have a stronger pattern.

730
01:24:50,070 --> 01:24:58,110
But but this pattern will have like ten different patterns when we look at the state level.

731
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:04,179
So the next thing we did is the co-location analysis, which again is the baby version of colocation.

732
01:25:04,180 --> 01:25:12,390
Now, we didn't use any cautions, so we're just we're just used to figuring out what is the ratio factor where,

733
01:25:13,050 --> 01:25:18,840
again, this is actually on the county level, sorry, state level, we don't have the county level yet.

734
01:25:19,050 --> 01:25:29,430
So so we just flagged each state. So if this state is is top four white race, black race or Hispanic race by their quintiles.

735
01:25:29,820 --> 01:25:39,150
And also we just look at it from another direction to see whether the cumulative total cases or cumulative deaths are amount to top quintiles.

736
01:25:39,480 --> 01:25:46,620
And we see if those two factors coexist in the same area, which is the state at this moment.

737
01:25:46,890 --> 01:25:49,890
So we can see that we only get a cumulative cases.

738
01:25:51,390 --> 01:25:58,260
Two states, which is Florida and Tennessee, showed a stronger pattern for for cumulative cases.

739
01:25:58,260 --> 01:26:10,370
When we look at the black black ethnicity group and when we look at the Hispanic cases, we we see that there are four states with,

740
01:26:10,650 --> 01:26:20,160
what, like stronger signal, like we can call it hotspots to see if there's a state state specific association.

741
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:24,040
Again, we can swap our definition for further.

742
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:31,980
How can we can look at death and the states flags will be different again.

743
01:26:32,310 --> 01:26:42,900
It's now up to robust because we can we can flag the like the racial factors by different quintiles like because we now you're using quintiles,

744
01:26:42,900 --> 01:26:48,360
but we can move the bars and we can probably have more states flagged or less.

745
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:57,110
And so but that's still that still shows that that the pattern we explored before,

746
01:26:57,900 --> 01:27:10,920
say black people have better higher rate rate of cases can be further explained by the how much homogeneity very heterogeneity of states.

747
01:27:11,190 --> 01:27:14,790
So here ends are presented in today.

748
01:27:14,790 --> 01:27:24,089
So our conclusion is that the increase of COVID cases there are related actually could be Aryans have cold coronavirus

749
01:27:24,090 --> 01:27:33,240
and overall if we look at spatial patterns and black poor black race is associated with COVID cases and deaths.

750
01:27:33,480 --> 01:27:41,340
But when we look at the states, we will find that not only blacks but Hispanic groups could also be associated with the outcome.

751
01:27:41,790 --> 01:27:51,360
And finally, the Diversity Migration Index, the really important thing to look at, but the pattern differs by states and counties.

752
01:27:51,660 --> 01:27:56,820
So our next step is that we need to capture more data because for now we don't have county level data.

753
01:27:57,060 --> 01:28:01,950
We could use the JHU data where actually, if you know that, I don't know if you know that,

754
01:28:01,950 --> 01:28:09,780
but CDC surveillance doesn't provide individual data which is super large, like 12 gigabytes, and we don't know how to best incorporate that.

755
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:16,680
And again, we need to incorporate other sources than our our teams collected.

756
01:28:17,220 --> 01:28:20,790
And again, this is not a inference or prediction.

757
01:28:20,790 --> 01:28:29,070
Yes, this is exploratory analysis. We need to do these models to do either influencer predictions.

758
01:28:30,150 --> 01:28:36,300
But thank you so much for your attention. But is.

759
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:45,570
I think this diversity index is very interesting and must be related to political integration.

760
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:50,160
And also Metro is the number two and reality index.

761
01:28:50,700 --> 01:28:55,799
And so yeah, I think it's variable you can give that right.

762
01:28:55,800 --> 01:29:01,740
And to just the for this racial diversity that I think that people are interested as.

763
01:29:02,250 --> 01:29:10,890
I mean what you on the divide is you confirm the of the results we know from literature that

764
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:19,530
African-Americans are proportionally higher of a risk of poor compared to other racial groups.

765
01:29:19,530 --> 01:29:24,210
And so it's very important to look at racial factors in this analysis.

766
01:29:26,070 --> 01:29:35,340
Great. Thank you. Send me the slides.

767
01:29:36,630 --> 01:29:40,990
Sure. We have one more class on Thursday and.

768
01:29:46,340 --> 01:29:57,190
We are the. Are your people divorce right there?

769
01:29:58,200 --> 01:30:07,540
The first thing that you can do can change the format.

770
01:30:08,050 --> 01:30:12,360
Yeah, try to explore that. I think we're loving everything.

771
01:30:12,640 --> 01:30:17,680
I guess when you ask someone hard to find out on their anniversary.

772
01:30:18,790 --> 01:30:24,070
Okay. Like on Thursday afternoon during the ramble so that we.

773
01:30:24,580 --> 01:30:28,590
Yeah. We want to discuss the future. Yeah, I think so.

774
01:30:30,740 --> 01:30:40,450
Yeah. And I also put in the presentation so I you how to turn after a seminar on Thursday.

775
01:30:40,450 --> 01:30:44,649
So if you want to come to that time to see me, then just sign this.

776
01:30:44,650 --> 01:30:53,310
We have this associate, right? So just indicate your time and which way to actually go after about after 430.

777
01:30:53,460 --> 01:30:59,290
Um. So probably 30 minutes one time then decide on that.

778
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:04,719
Okay. Well, I know where you are in this Excel sheet at Google Excel ship.

779
01:31:04,720 --> 01:31:09,129
Great. Where you know, that's where you sign there. The time, everything.

780
01:31:09,130 --> 01:31:11,300
They're like team. Oh yeah.

781
01:31:11,650 --> 01:31:22,780
What would you want to try to set up a set of content for me and I just put a tiny little front folder coming out of the 430 Starting Point.

782
01:31:22,780 --> 01:31:37,210
They're often similar like. I don't think he'd want to do that.

783
01:31:40,280 --> 01:31:41,260
So six.
