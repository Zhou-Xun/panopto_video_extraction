1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,070
Because I know a couple of students who had some.

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:17,870
Family sense all being. So we want to make sure they have access to discussion today.

3
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:35,830
Just quickly ask you. Of course, you all have sent the information I put on commerce regarding the extent we were helpful at U.S., for example.

4
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:41,860
So I if you don't have any questions, that's great.

5
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,980
I try to make it as clear as possible.

6
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:53,320
But if anyone have a question, please ask me as soon as you can, because a lot of time I'm working on some other things.

7
00:00:53,980 --> 00:01:00,350
That's also person. I don't necessarily check your watch my emails right the day before.

8
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:07,040
All right. That's minutes, although I try to watch as closely.

9
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:18,640
So, um, yeah, two days after the class and we're also, uh, upload the study guide,

10
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:32,470
which I know will help you to focus on some very important take home messages and help you to prepare for the exam.

11
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:39,750
So. And then I guess I was just going to ask, what is the format of the exam?

12
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:46,260
Is it like shorthand? Sort of? I think it would be a mix of four different kind of questions.

13
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:53,790
There would be one big question that included much more small questions each.

14
00:01:53,790 --> 00:02:01,950
Others are important to basic concepts, and I don't necessarily ask you to, you know,

15
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:12,150
since open book and it would be more, you know, analyze rather than memorize or copy paste.

16
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:23,700
So I would spell out some of the basic concepts I ask you to feel a short term.

17
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:37,560
What's that statement to say? Then the second question could have multiple choice relate to an important concept or piece of knowledge,

18
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:44,010
and you check or applied applied to that question.

19
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:48,770
It's not only one choice, it could be or choice.

20
00:02:48,780 --> 00:03:00,900
It could be only one of several. And then another question, it's also testing your understanding through the materials.

21
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,729
So I could provide a statement.

22
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:21,540
I haven't written to complete the exam yet, so I may write a statement, ask you to see if this statement is correct and this statement can be correct.

23
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:28,110
It it can also be passion incomplete.

24
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:44,420
For example, if we see in vaccinology a reference means a product, you know, has a reference product that's not quite a complete concept.

25
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:54,420
It's not so incorrect. But the correct answer for that's a reference we will cover it may so two different things.

26
00:03:54,510 --> 00:04:02,700
It could mean a product's use as a reference. It could also mean a set of standards so so something like that.

27
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:09,990
And then if you know, if there are some exclusion criteria for something,

28
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:16,560
if I only list the part of that you can consider that's incomplete or partial.

29
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:27,570
So that kind of question, it's also require you remember that synthesize, analyze the statement of process and memorize.

30
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:41,280
And then there were be always probably a couple which will happen so questions where you everyone can have you know is open and people can do.

31
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:50,679
Okay. I know you want to know that when I get this thing, information of the origin.

32
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:55,060
I was going to talk about that. So today and then.

33
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:01,240
Okay, now let's start today's discussion.

34
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:08,470
There's a very important part of the facts and the part I see important.

35
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:23,920
If I understand, you know, the purpose of clinical evaluation and what needs to be done to come back to clinical evaluation,

36
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:28,360
because it's the critical piece of information for license.

37
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:38,590
And then, um, you know, uh, but this is not a methodology course,

38
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:49,810
so we don't necessarily discuss the details of how to, you know, calculate your study sample and your work.

39
00:05:50,170 --> 00:06:00,640
But so we were laid out some principles in consideration of the study population, analyze the data, designing the study.

40
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:06,250
Those fundamental principles were to be covered today.

41
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:12,120
Then I'm going to do two sessions.

42
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,740
First is the traditional face.

43
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:22,950
So one, two, three clinical trials for axon axis.

44
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:33,590
This is important because the innovative approach is based on many conceptual framework.

45
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:43,239
Fundamental principles are based on these. It just gives you more flexibility in terms of retirement age.

46
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:50,870
It a resource the of population so that perhaps probably mostly more information.

47
00:06:51,260 --> 00:07:00,570
So that's a you know and you know in the interest of time and population resource.

48
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:07,640
What else can be done but still they a future advance of this fundamental design.

49
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:15,180
That's why I think I would spend a little bit more time to do this first part that runs through the information for.

50
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:26,330
So basically the first thing I want to talk about, determinants of vaccine development and the clinical vaccine trial preparation.

51
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:43,090
Some of you asked early on, what's the. Ask me or you know how you want me to be in the I am doing an investigational new drug plan.

52
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:52,630
Definitely how you plan to do the clinical trial where the essential information component in that plan.

53
00:07:53,140 --> 00:08:00,360
And then we were specifically talking about the three phase clinical trials and

54
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:08,140
they are really respective goals and how transitioning from one place to another.

55
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:14,740
Before that, I want to ask a question here, if I could.

56
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:21,250
Are you able to say the question? I try to get to actually have more than one person.

57
00:08:29,350 --> 00:09:34,360
Are you able to get into the. Very good.

58
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:42,290
Well, the question. So far we don't see any.

59
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:48,300
Yes. Which is good, because the answer is no, not necessarily.

60
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:52,970
And then the next question is whether.

61
00:09:54,850 --> 00:10:00,550
Oh, wait a minute. I think the note is correct.

62
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:12,910
Right. Can I ask anybody here to see if it's the watch that determines the pass through?

63
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:26,770
Vaccine development seen here has some the more difficult answer is not all vaccine.

64
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:33,740
Depends on the type of that has been done and the urgency and the needs of the vaccine.

65
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,930
And here you we see some explanation.

66
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:46,640
What's determined for the path of vaccine development for.

67
00:10:51,580 --> 00:11:03,880
Divers. So why not determine the type of max?

68
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:10,130
Of course, some type of vaccine requirement. What does that mean?

69
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:21,600
Because this has something to do with our previous discussion about, you know, different vaccine technologies that could reverse vaccinology pace,

70
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:28,530
the vaccine development that really starts with the genomic sequence of the patents.

71
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:35,890
Why are some other vaccines, which, for example, if you supported sacrifice,

72
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:45,820
you come to take advantage of working in sequence information so you can't really use of smaller reverse vaccinology.

73
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:51,360
So for that kind of vaccine, you start with the culture of the organism, right?

74
00:11:51,610 --> 00:12:01,629
If you can, the vaccine is a full package of protein antigen, then you can use a reverse.

75
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:06,580
Vaccinology starts with the analyze of the genomic sequence.

76
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:13,670
Identify the vaccine antigen antigens of the pathogen with the facts and potential.

77
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:17,070
Then you go back to test in the animals.

78
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:22,390
But this is the type of vaccine disease characteristics.

79
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:37,599
Yeah. Depends on, you know, hearsay, disease, currencies, pathogenesis and cancer, genesis or epidemiological characters and to which populations.

80
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:43,720
So it would be dif different. Some you can measure, you know,

81
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:54,520
with a relatively small population and so you have to use larger and the longer time if we see some more chronic infection,

82
00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:00,550
we some short time you would not be able to complete all the clinical assessment.

83
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:04,450
So it really depends on the characteristic disease.

84
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:17,380
And then population, which I will discuss is shortly when we talk about the study design, then availability of existing vaccine.

85
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:22,150
When we talk about safety, sometimes, you know,

86
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:36,460
the vaccine may be approved produce in other countries and have been used the for other populations, but it's new for another country.

87
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:47,860
So in that case, you may be able to learn something from previous vaccine and that have been licensed in other population, other countries.

88
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:56,290
So that we are also, you know, to make difference in the study design the parts of.

89
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:02,200
The. Vaccine development.

90
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:12,250
Yeah. Here we have some. What are the characteristics that all new vaccine must demonstrate no matter what parts?

91
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:29,350
Up facts and development pegs. You still need to all have to eventually meet certain goals to demonstrate some characteristics.

92
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:35,950
Any new facts has to do with potency, efficacy, safety.

93
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:42,080
Safe and effective. These are fundamental requirements.

94
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:59,770
Yeah. Mm hmm. Good.

95
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:11,830
Yeah. I think we'll cover some of the bird base or new vaccines need to demonstrate safety, protective privacy.

96
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:17,980
I think when you say potency, purity, it meets the biological characteristics.

97
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:27,730
But so for license, you will want to do this to show the practical effects of being subject to the before record.

98
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:39,300
Third license. So although potency is a term used to describe the ability of the vaccine to protect the population.

99
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:46,520
But that's more a biological concept. But for license, you don't just see these strategies.

100
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:52,800
You need to show the protective effects in a subject.

101
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:59,130
So this is not quite the same, right? Once a laboratory demonstrates the potency.

102
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:14,470
So I think for your answer with a little bit of terminology correction to cover the two of the essentials, why we also need to have immunogenicity.

103
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:21,750
I think immunogenicity is sort of the basis for protective effects and to.

104
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:39,590
What you can use if you can demonstrate the patient could generate some protective immune response by giving this particular immunity of a vaccine.

105
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:49,730
That means you have a biological basis for disease protection, and it's important.

106
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,360
With no sponsor immunogenicity.

107
00:16:53,750 --> 00:17:03,920
It's actually measured prior to clinical trial and also during the clinical trials, even after the trial, for example.

108
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:17,750
Why do we need to know this? Because this is indication of the body has some immune mechanism to fight against infection.

109
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:31,190
If you know these these also have some important implication for how long you have to do the clinical studies, which I would discuss later.

110
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:34,820
So this is reasons we want to.

111
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:53,620
Demonstrates before we can license a vaccine, and then typically prior to license release, we would have those three phase clinical trials.

112
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:58,150
Then phase four is a post licensure evaluation.

113
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:13,360
And this is also we are designed to use this opportunity design and then activity seven survey package to.

114
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:21,790
A safety outcome or a poor pick up for the bucks.

115
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:36,990
So. It's what we work doing to address the needs to demonstrate the safety, immunogenicity and the protective effects.

116
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:42,150
Basically, it was. Then from this.

117
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:57,190
So if I ask you a question, how we can then have facts and safety practices and ideally you were think about prior licensure.

118
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:04,560
We were to, you know, after animal studies, we were to phase one, phase three, phase three trial.

119
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:08,760
But this is not completed.

120
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:17,910
Then prior to licensing, more knowledge need to be up and post the licenses.

121
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:25,780
The other phase of trial or observation of studies, lack of surveillance of the disease.

122
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:31,740
So what do we need to prepare before a vaccine trial?

123
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:39,630
And you want to prepare supporting data for antigen and the formulation selection?

124
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:48,030
Well, you start contrary. You have a very defined dose and how many microgram per minute.

125
00:19:48,600 --> 00:20:00,480
So this has to be done initially in by animal studies or if it's some vaccine licensed, should other population that could also be approved.

126
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:09,960
But if it was purely based on animal studies, you also want to understand for this particular disease,

127
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:18,210
if there is good animal model that's we make the the pathogenesis of the disease.

128
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:24,720
If there's good animal model, then that's of knowledge.

129
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:30,930
The low niche then from the animal studies where be more transfer to human.

130
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:40,710
Otherwise we need to learn more. But the you need to understand the editing and relation and the determination of to deliver road and the dose.

131
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:48,569
This is you know you have to get similar to the antigen and the formulation based on the pre-clinical

132
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:56,820
evaluation in animal studies and if there are other if similar vaccine are licensing other population,

133
00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:07,080
you could also in reference that and then estimate of the potential need for those because when you prepare a trial,

134
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:16,739
you want to know if your primary serial vaccine vaccination is one dose or it

135
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:23,819
may be two or three those so these are some you don't to really wait until

136
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:37,469
your state one dose is oh I need this you know well that's not what you have to predetermine this needs the establishment of adequate safety data.

137
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:46,700
But as I say, this has to come from animal studies or other studies in humans.

138
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:58,440
Evaluate you submit the vaccine. Of course, when you have taken other vaccine study as a reference, you always want to question.

139
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:16,229
An important difference is if the population you know a similar to your target the population and will not see similar it means many you know general

140
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:30,330
or health condition genetic could back one a lot so that all the sense that could impact an individual's response to infection should be considered.

141
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:39,510
So that's the safety database is very important and you may not have much information if we suffer any effects.

142
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:47,970
But the a lot of food, the time to use vaccine has gone through several generations of a vaccine, for example,

143
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:58,170
from for cell killed for cell vaccine that can, you know, inactivates the wholesale vaccine or even stop you.

144
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:05,730
And, in fact. So there are some information out there that could be part of the safety database.

145
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:12,180
Now, also, you want to develop a lab method to test the immunogenicity.

146
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:16,790
So this is something you can start to think about this.

147
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:31,470
Why I think I touched base briefly earlier, but today we will talk more should typical protective efficacy study is measure disease right.

148
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:35,190
If the outcome is the incidence.

149
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:44,370
After infection, but then later we expanded that to burden of disease, severe disease,

150
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:57,989
which I also talk about relief and then you why you need to immunogenicity basically is to measure the immune response after,

151
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:08,510
for example, connect to the plateau or. So from the Vaseline and who test the particular neutralizing antibody,

152
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:16,520
if it's an HIV vaccine or any vaccine that's antibody mediated or particular T.

153
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:24,030
I mean, so that's the immunity.

154
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:33,310
And you need to have the rest of your license or any more than ID is racking up Chapter four clinical trials.

155
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:40,300
You always have to determine questions to be answered and the what are you a priority question?

156
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:46,960
You can start raising this these now what will be the primary question for each of these clinical trials?

157
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:54,610
And then what's the secondary questions? What's the defined primary?

158
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:01,150
What kind of a question? We would have concedes them as a primary question?

159
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:06,580
What sets of question would work on several secondary questions.

160
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:12,340
So these are some or we will talk more shortly.

161
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:23,710
But to start with and ask yourself this question, what you would consider as a primary, then you'll need to development for GCP.

162
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:30,260
You have to GMP good manufacture practice.

163
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:36,790
And here we introduce another concept of GCP, the clinical practice protocols.

164
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:45,100
And individual operation could really mess up for some of the trial funding.

165
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:49,359
So you want to have training plan and protocol.

166
00:25:49,360 --> 00:26:01,780
GCP protocol is very specifically spelled out, and you also need to design of the case reporting form and the case reporting form.

167
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:11,889
What is the use? Because of the data collected, the stories will allow you to analyze, to answer the questions.

168
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:19,330
Use that primary secondary. So what needs to be reported in your case?

169
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:26,170
Reporting form will determine your opinion to how much you can you can learn from the clinical trials.

170
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:33,880
It depends. It will also determine how substantial data collection can be.

171
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:40,390
So this is important. Establishment of investigation or key system for experience.

172
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:45,220
The personal coding trial. We talked about this before.

173
00:26:45,560 --> 00:27:01,450
You need diverse sets of expertize and so they are definitely a physician nurse and to helping with the diagnosis of some of up with these.

174
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:05,890
But there are also many other people like your public health professional.

175
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:11,110
Some of our work with data analyze collection, some of our work with government,

176
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:22,880
local governments are trying to do to, you know, ensure the access to local populations is a lot of effort.

177
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:32,530
And then also very important is your items you find sufficient of site with access to huge population.

178
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:40,260
Some of the example I would give to you today shows you how most of follow up can happen,

179
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:49,180
especially in many of the vaccine trials come back to the developing country and population.

180
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:58,590
He experienced all kind of food, you know, is a hardship that's somewhat predictable.

181
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:05,370
Some I'm not sure. So you want to have full backup sites identified?

182
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:10,290
It's not just the sites. You were wrong in your initial phase.

183
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:13,470
You need to do that backup.

184
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:18,850
So this is from Nature Review. Yes.

185
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:27,180
But I think it's a still highlights the some essential difference and that is serve as a quick overview of.

186
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:35,490
You don't notice the difference in the locations?

187
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:43,770
That's a sample size. I have I would say had four times, all had really wide range.

188
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:50,220
How many have you had for starters? I haven't collected.

189
00:28:53,820 --> 00:29:00,370
Good. Very few eyes. I would just suggest you to start something.

190
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:04,390
And ideally you have to look.

191
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:13,250
That's some kind of trial example so that you can try to make the comments.

192
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:18,400
How is that reflected? What's the hope?

193
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:23,380
The reason I would like you to do it is the sample collection.

194
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:27,730
Later, I will also share the collected sample with everyone.

195
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:38,740
If you want to analyze you know from the example you can and to compare to the general

196
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:45,270
knowledge about the three things of practice and decide how much integration to read.

197
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:50,970
You will see why. Some pieces had with them.

198
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:56,110
The typical way. Some with some. It will be interesting to have.

199
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:03,650
Some some, you know, the observation that, okay,

200
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:16,590
basically the size starts to increase the location transition from where the vaccine developed for example person.

201
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:21,490
Here are of the people.

202
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:29,380
But when you do face to face with trying to address this kind of.

203
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:35,610
You want to go to represent yourself, what you represent.

204
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:41,710
You said you. What does that mean to you?

205
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:55,580
A population that is affected. Yeah.

206
00:30:55,790 --> 00:31:03,710
I guess the higher the package, if it's the package, the disease, the infection affect the population.

207
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:11,630
So you want to use that? Not so least that the.

208
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:23,090
Phase four, of course, where the vaccine has been introduced and the president and the representative of Section 30.

209
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:41,510
So then you can also see as soon as you start to do some comparative analyzes where possible, and then study trends that you use, recommend a trial.

210
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:47,090
This is the Golden State. Another important thing to highlight here.

211
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:52,670
It's, you know. To be.

212
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:58,339
Cool face to face. So how about that?

213
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:03,110
There are some variations of face to face cooking.

214
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:07,220
It is a challenge.

215
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:15,219
What does this mean? Ten. Yeah.

216
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:24,040
I was really hoping some of. But when you do a review, you could look that up.

217
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:31,440
If you are curious about what's challenging, study is use your imagination.

218
00:32:37,200 --> 00:33:01,850
All right. When it comes. You were you were exposed.

219
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:07,340
The study is subject to the package infection.

220
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:10,639
Actually, then you were saved for the facts later.

221
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:20,820
The good work where protects against this when we the the challenging the pathogen.

222
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:26,390
So how we do this kind of study for all the pathogens.

223
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:37,740
What are we able to do for all? You know, I.

224
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:41,600
Yeah, you are right. I thought you would say no.

225
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:46,490
This is only for parents working that's made a career manager.

226
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:50,720
In other words, we have an effective treatment.

227
00:33:51,260 --> 00:34:02,210
And if you know it's something we don't have effective treatment or is something for life, you would not do that.

228
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:06,140
So I hope some of you will look up some of the examples.

229
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:10,780
Uh, for the interest of time, I think I will.

230
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:18,920
So for phase one vaccine trial, that's the first time introduced to humans.

231
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:23,210
So usually it's the volunteer.

232
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:31,490
It's not uncommon. Sometimes it's just in the research center or lab where they develop the vaccine.

233
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:34,520
The purpose is very clear.

234
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:51,520
It's to show an acceptable margin of safety and then also introduce a response so that you can justify to move you to more people.

235
00:34:51,530 --> 00:35:02,780
This is typically very small study less than 50 subjects and the safety readout is reactogenicity

236
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:11,990
and anon you another term reactogenicity and the number of studies you can for once vaccine.

237
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:18,210
You can do one study. You could also do more than one studies.

238
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:30,200
Depends, you know, the resource and sense of the nature of the vaccine, typically at least six months after the final injection.

239
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:44,700
But when you review your clinical trial study, pay attention to see the timeframe for the Phase one, why some were smaller, a shorter standard.

240
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:49,070
But this is traditional and protocol.

241
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:53,570
Important thing is to also understand this concept.

242
00:35:54,230 --> 00:36:03,049
Reactogenicity basically is a measure for local antigen or inflammatory response to one or

243
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:09,260
more components of the formulation what you give to the people characterized by collecting.

244
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:18,830
So this is the adverse events, this is reactogenicity and we just talk about the immunogenicity added to the same.

245
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:27,020
You probably also can be sure that you'll get some question related to this other than same.

246
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:47,990
They are not the same. So yeah, there's no immunogenicity is really to stimulate the immune response that you ideally

247
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:55,370
relate to the protective effects react against the it's really is a reaction to vaccine.

248
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:59,809
It can be adverse event, adverse side effects.

249
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:07,850
All these are possible. So there is no direct link between vaccine reactogenicity and the immunogenicity.

250
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:16,879
So you you will not tell people, oh, when they have a big reaction or you have what's good you realize that's not

251
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:25,160
always true varies among individuals developing an equivalent immune response.

252
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:31,730
So some people may have very strong, very strong reactogenicity fell by accident,

253
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:40,070
but do not necessarily develop for the idea of, you know, protected immune response.

254
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:53,720
However inflammatory the inflammatory process at the senior level play a crucial role in the induction of immune response.

255
00:37:54,290 --> 00:38:04,940
In other words, you know why inflammatory response is due to reactogenicity, but on the other hand,

256
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:15,950
it's still some kind of feel good immune response, response to the invited antigen.

257
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:26,620
So they have very important role. If someone has no ability to act to a vaccine for people who have very compromised used,

258
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:32,810
they may not be able to even have this kind of inflammatory response.

259
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:46,520
So these two are not directly linked to the inflammation, the way it reflects the individual's affinity to, you know.

260
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:56,570
Develop some immune response, although they don't have a direct link means higher one.

261
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:01,340
It will be higher for other that know such a relationship.

262
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:07,070
But on the other hand, you should also recognize the role.

263
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:24,260
The crucial role in a process is because of many cytokines that are involved in immune response is also they are also involved in the immune response.

264
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:28,459
So. Just know these two are not the same.

265
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:39,050
Is clear. Or have any questions. Yeah.

266
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:48,790
So. So this is the adverse events, local reactions that we talked about and also general signs and symptoms, correct.

267
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,920
In 4 to 7 days following each dose.

268
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:56,450
Also records, also adverse events during a defined time.

269
00:39:57,110 --> 00:40:05,390
Typically in the clinical study protocol, they have defined a set of adverse events to look for,

270
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:10,670
but you are also supposed to observe anything that's not predefined.

271
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:24,520
So that's, you know, the your knowledge about safety can be generated and general rules for phase one trial dose selection, it's not a single dose.

272
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:26,460
Typically you select a range,

273
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:37,400
then one dose predict to be less than optimal immunogenicity and one dose representing the likely appearance of safety to be prac.

274
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:41,660
You cannot inject it too high.

275
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:48,570
There is a threshold, so then you could have one or more intermediate.

276
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:55,790
These are some general principle you can, when you do your clinical trials summarized.

277
00:40:55,910 --> 00:41:01,850
You could have highlights how this kind of rules have been applied in this study.

278
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:08,630
And then phase two vaccine trials traditionally gather more data and safety.

279
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,020
Safety is still a primary question.

280
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:21,440
And then you can also get immunogenicity basically to see if a specific immune response can be induced.

281
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:35,660
The Pfizer vaccine. It's also because for more people, it's a also give you the possibility to have some more those range than in phase one.

282
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:43,850
If phase one have only a few dozens, if true, then you can't have many different dose group.

283
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:47,630
But in phase two you can have more.

284
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:53,870
It can last longer. But what's important is to know to today.

285
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:58,700
Phase two is a lot of time in the innovative approach.

286
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:08,120
Phase two is no longer just has a dose range of safety immunogenicity.

287
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:13,490
It's often used as a pilot of efficacy trial.

288
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:21,830
And these it can be very large, as large as are typical for phase three.

289
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:29,180
Basically, it allows more robust protective effects,

290
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:39,970
but you don't do you really think about doing this pilot effects unless the disease is really high, press is for disease.

291
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:46,700
The incidence is not that high. You you have to use a very large sample.

292
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:52,339
Then it's the better you learn something for sure before you move to.

293
00:42:52,340 --> 00:43:00,559
That's a very big sample so I highlighted here should be considered for the instance of the disease is a sufficiently

294
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:12,680
high risk as the we just heard doctor want to talk about COVID 19 and can use that is of phase two efficacy.

295
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,190
Pertinent extra.

296
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:30,350
This can provide important data for refining endpoints and the case definition for Phase three trial improving study protocol of procedure and system.

297
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:39,140
It will also allow you to evaluate study sites because of phase three where you involve more and there sites.

298
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:49,879
It's not a surprising in some sites that have to be taken were strong for different reasons and the permitting better sample

299
00:43:49,880 --> 00:44:03,210
size estimates for phase three because you were then that's you know a lot of sense that the information required for design,

300
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:12,260
the study sample and the calculations that sense it may not be all reliable.

301
00:44:12,510 --> 00:44:22,280
Actually, disease incidence from the package clinical site may varies from population, so that's important.

302
00:44:22,850 --> 00:44:26,750
And then experiments the challenges that that we just talked about.

303
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:29,640
This is really the most effective.

304
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:41,360
Actually, if you look in the paper that look for the declaration, there have been one time proposal for the challenges.

305
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:45,320
That is that even for COVID 19, there was I noticed some articles,

306
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:53,240
but I hope your assignment will help us to complete the study of different cutting trials.

307
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:59,300
So since phase two pregnancies effects this study is using.

308
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:07,670
So how do you figure out you?

309
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:23,120
How do you figure out if it's safe? Like. Usually they are conceits of form of the population in human and human subjects.

310
00:45:24,010 --> 00:45:29,390
So usually they are an absence of first. You have to be involved.

311
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:37,280
Yeah. Here. This particular slide, if you are thinking this one, this isn't for Chan and your study.

312
00:45:37,550 --> 00:45:47,660
You definitely don't include them, which means you expose them to the pathogen, then compelled to vaccinate the first person.

313
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:51,389
But usually women, children, they don't.

314
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:58,200
So they are not typically caught in the early stages of facts.

315
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:07,550
Even with the COVID 19 and more later, they definitely consider the form of the population.

316
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:26,380
These are. Okay. So since I will discuss both Phase two pilot efficacy and Phase three together,

317
00:46:28,270 --> 00:46:39,370
given that the medicines are similar and these are safety design, so phase three are of course much more people involved.

318
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:48,040
And it's important the license licensure decision by the deed, it's data,

319
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:57,160
it can last for several years and against phase three where provides rigorous evidence

320
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:03,250
about the protection against the naturally occurring infection and and all pieces.

321
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:17,740
So designing for the phase three trial, we require using these the gold standard design of the random control for safety.

322
00:47:18,190 --> 00:47:29,830
I'm sure in your statistic class or epidemic of magic cross you have talked about to ask you have you heard

323
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:41,980
I yeah okay so that this is the required by many national drug regulatory agency like FDA and some agency.

324
00:47:42,910 --> 00:47:46,030
I'm like, What? I'm sorry. I just.

325
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:49,720
I of. I have to correct this, but I still.

326
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:57,210
Oh, yes, I did. I think your size me means that this team pockets the pieces.

327
00:47:57,790 --> 00:48:03,320
Um. Yeah, that makes sense there.

328
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:10,570
Okay, so this is very important. You understand the key design.

329
00:48:10,810 --> 00:48:24,880
So the first part may not be so. So. Of this is simply Pfizer's vaccine trial, designed as a tool for randomized controlled trials.

330
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:32,080
Such a trial of the study population is a sample from a target population, as you can see here.

331
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:43,060
Population based population. When I first started going through all that, I need to inform the concern.

332
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:56,760
And I got the approval. And then you have some who are stuck in politics so that the study population will be randomized.

333
00:48:56,770 --> 00:49:00,100
So. Swimming pool.

334
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:07,090
This is supposed sometimes sometimes can have a match for a comparative difference.

335
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:19,720
If you have a different dose, for example, if you have a difference of backs and some type of a moderate versus a sort of being a person.

336
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:27,460
So these experiments are group. This is a simplified back and forth in practice.

337
00:49:27,910 --> 00:49:36,010
You could have one comparing you and you can have a multiple experiment representing different difference of those

338
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:50,050
for vaccine or different form of vaccine or difference of deliver rounds of spray versus intradermal vaccine.

339
00:49:50,380 --> 00:50:05,380
So you could potentially use in the same study population and to randomized distribution to more than one experimental group into the study.

340
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:08,590
So that that you would have more than one.

341
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:20,750
But what's important to note is that, for example, for your information, you need to think about synthesis three since we need to.

342
00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:26,960
Is that to license your vaccine safety immunogenicity?

343
00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:40,520
And protecting folks. So these are three questions for each, you know, market price comparison points in your testing experiment.

344
00:50:41,150 --> 00:50:47,760
Experiment. And I think more them. So what do you want to find out is.

345
00:50:49,310 --> 00:50:56,850
After you have been checked your. Has the vaccine all you want, plus the aging.

346
00:50:57,540 --> 00:51:06,400
You want to follow up package infection. Here, I also think you should also improve the package of the infection disease.

347
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:12,180
I'm not quite the same person for some pieces of.

348
00:51:13,130 --> 00:51:20,080
For some parasitic infection. It's almost like this is, you know, acute infection.

349
00:51:20,450 --> 00:51:24,260
Many hands would use that in a health care setting.

350
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:36,520
They use the infection a lot because infections, almost nothing like this can be of the HPV infection.

351
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:44,210
You infection is once the feces. So if you look, that's why you come here.

352
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:48,900
People have this space. You try to smash these things.

353
00:51:49,950 --> 00:51:57,110
So some of these after the bus, magic, simple smack.

354
00:51:57,870 --> 00:52:07,949
So, of course, I don't need to cancel to tell you how to calculate this, since you all have some basic statistics.

355
00:52:07,950 --> 00:52:11,820
This is also simplified calculation.

356
00:52:11,830 --> 00:52:19,650
Basically, you compared the rate or risk in the vaccine group versus the control group.

357
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:25,830
And you could also include includes more than one person group.

358
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:32,370
Then you say what you can find out and.

359
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:41,880
Protected proxy is Convention Protection Index and the package.

360
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:53,240
Like the use in this formula. So what needs you to do when you get to the results means no progress.

361
00:52:53,850 --> 00:52:57,630
And then 100%.

362
00:52:58,170 --> 00:53:03,260
And that's a complete picture.

363
00:53:03,690 --> 00:53:08,460
Most of the vaccine is licensed vaccine.

364
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:13,890
It's not paid to that. And sometimes. So when you have more than one the.

365
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:24,220
Those in the primers, sir, you could increase that protective effects,

366
00:53:24,610 --> 00:53:34,060
but sometimes you could also deter and, you know, negative how that could happen.

367
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:39,890
Now. I'm just wanting to show you some.

368
00:53:42,110 --> 00:53:50,870
This is a study of fields as far as the field over your corridor banks and in maps Bangladesh.

369
00:53:51,470 --> 00:54:00,890
So you could you can see that this study it gives you an example you can go to play afterwards.

370
00:54:01,310 --> 00:54:06,830
Basically, it shows you how the calculation is done for each school.

371
00:54:07,490 --> 00:54:11,960
Apparently, they include more than one group in the study.

372
00:54:13,730 --> 00:54:16,760
One course she is. This is active in.

373
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:31,120
Sure. To make sure it's this activity.

374
00:54:32,530 --> 00:54:38,180
Are you able to access to this course you. Hmm.

375
00:54:39,620 --> 00:54:46,519
Oh. What happened? Sorry. Are you able to access to this?

376
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:49,850
Course you. Okay.

377
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:47,930
This may be. The trial next.

378
00:55:48,090 --> 00:56:21,410
A peer to. Effective or save.

379
00:56:26,820 --> 00:56:31,740
I think you have got some good answer here.

380
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:39,270
And the vaccine is not effective. Why? Vaccine is not effective or vaccine is not effective.

381
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:47,760
You may see more when we say the target, the infection, if it hurts, who is not protected?

382
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:51,329
Yeah. If it's a negative, it means not protected.

383
00:56:51,330 --> 00:56:55,260
We'll hear some of you say the vaccine is not effective.

384
00:56:55,770 --> 00:57:08,040
Why wouldn't you know? Definitely when it's a negative for believe, it suggests the vaccine is not effective.

385
00:57:08,490 --> 00:57:19,590
But why wouldn't you? This is what we often talk about when you introduce a vaccine in a poll and weekly,

386
00:57:20,130 --> 00:57:29,790
weekly, effective vaccine, you have the risk to increase risky health behavior.

387
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:36,570
For example, if it's a respiratory infection, all people say, I'm vaccinated, I probably am protected.

388
00:57:36,930 --> 00:57:43,290
And there have been people talking about not getting flu vaccine this year, just the U.S. does.

389
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:54,120
So if the centers when you do vaccine, introduce vaccine and people think, oh, the vaccine, I have a vaccine and then I'm protected.

390
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:58,169
When you introduce a less effective vaccine,

391
00:57:58,170 --> 00:58:15,270
you can actually encourage no one encouraging some risk of health behavior that could make the vaccinated groups at higher risk for infection.

392
00:58:15,630 --> 00:58:28,470
And then from answer also mentioned to say, well, this HIV is interesting comes two and then another 30 and also talks of vaccine harmful.

393
00:58:28,740 --> 00:58:35,150
How could a vaccine harmful? And we are talking about the package, the infected means of it.

394
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:39,770
And, you know, not to any kind of adverse event.

395
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:45,080
It's not to protect against have it.

396
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:46,350
In fact,

397
00:58:46,860 --> 00:59:02,160
you may think that that might be a vaccine horse to induce the disease that becomes not adequate be inactivated or not done in the life population.

398
00:59:02,190 --> 00:59:09,630
Right. If then there could be also sometimes the population has been, you know,

399
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:18,360
exposed to some environments of pathogen that does provide some cross-protection that may,

400
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:22,770
by chance or in the control group,

401
00:59:22,770 --> 00:59:30,440
may have more exposed to some environmental pathogens that could potentially problem

402
00:59:31,020 --> 00:59:37,380
to the non-vaccinated or the absence of some protection in the vaccination.

403
00:59:38,130 --> 00:59:48,540
So this is just some sense for you to think about and I know say or even it's a no protection, but how could it be even negative?

404
00:59:48,690 --> 00:59:55,470
Meaning vaccinated would go for actually got more infection or disease than among vaccinated people.

405
00:59:56,010 --> 01:00:06,450
Then you want to question many factors and the environment factors, the trial design and the vaccine itself.

406
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:12,370
So all these different possibilities. And, of course, she's.

407
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:27,740
Okay. I think I can skip theses strands of the updated designs since you all have had some exposure to the ACTU design.

408
01:00:29,130 --> 01:00:35,640
So I want to emphasize a few points here in the vaccine design.

409
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:40,070
It's a potent rights and research question for sure.

410
01:00:40,770 --> 01:00:47,940
And the vaccine trial, we have primary questions, secondary questions, questions.

411
01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:51,030
You need to also when you.

412
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:57,310
Post question you have to define this question for what population?

413
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:08,710
So what are the primary questions, pertinent questions based on this evidence which would be conceived by regulatory agencies in licensor?

414
01:01:10,090 --> 01:01:20,530
So what have the license should be? We already say you have to show all new vaccine.

415
01:01:20,620 --> 01:01:27,910
Had to show safety, protective effects and immunogenicity.

416
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:32,050
So these are the courtiers.

417
01:01:32,410 --> 01:01:39,700
That's the regulatory agency where use to determine if these vaccines should be licensed.

418
01:01:40,150 --> 01:01:46,390
So if I say safety, you definitely worsen because that's the primary question, right?

419
01:01:46,810 --> 01:01:57,160
And then if I say protected efficacy, of course, if I see primary quasi vaccines.

420
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:02,760
Phase three trial includes the safety. You would?

421
01:02:03,030 --> 01:02:06,349
Yes, it is correct to statement. It's not complete.

422
01:02:06,350 --> 01:02:11,010
The concept should be you were your answer probably would be incomplete.

423
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:17,640
This statement because this concept is premier questions should include more than just safety.

424
01:02:18,090 --> 01:02:27,120
So when this is, you know, what's the primary question basically is the answer to this question where of

425
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:35,100
helpful inference and the decision of the regulatory agency for the licensure.

426
01:02:37,060 --> 01:02:44,170
600 questions additional important and scientific issues of interest.

427
01:02:44,590 --> 01:02:48,520
What could be additional questions?

428
01:03:07,570 --> 01:03:14,510
What can be additional scientific group interests related to vaccine?

429
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:27,200
What? Maybe like the length of protection.

430
01:03:28,220 --> 01:03:32,300
Yeah. Then several protected loads of immunogens.

431
01:03:32,810 --> 01:03:39,440
Immune response answers a timeline of developing immune responses.

432
01:03:39,620 --> 01:03:44,430
Particular sets of what would be protected.

433
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:54,440
And, you know, immunogenicity is a big 711, to be honest, that doing that already is a study.

434
01:03:54,440 --> 01:04:06,650
You just know there's some individuals that's a weak immunity and this immune response is directly related to the protective immunity,

435
01:04:06,980 --> 01:04:13,160
this sense that we need to look and then how long we can expect that,

436
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:27,530
you know, it's expected that these are the immune response that could peak and the how long it can persist and how long it is reduced.

437
01:04:27,860 --> 01:04:32,870
And then for those of us have been doing a lot of the molecular epidemiology,

438
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:42,630
you must be interesting if this vaccine protects different hands to achieve strength equally.

439
01:04:42,830 --> 01:04:52,640
Right. If we have a vaccine and maybe it's a protective like the COVID 19 vaccine and we know it protects against the previous.

440
01:04:54,070 --> 01:04:59,890
Strength. How that protects the. And all these can be useful.

441
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:09,810
Keep thinking what truth is so come true. We don't have to have answer today, but you just understand.

442
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:13,950
Answer. What's this two difference?

443
01:05:14,910 --> 01:05:19,890
But when you ask a question, you need to specify target population.

444
01:05:20,220 --> 01:05:25,110
This comes back to our earlier question about pregnant women.

445
01:05:25,410 --> 01:05:29,660
You have to say this package is like a COVID 19 disease.

446
01:05:29,670 --> 01:05:38,670
Most of the fresh memory, the latest, the major vaccine development for you, targets on different population children.

447
01:05:39,090 --> 01:05:44,430
It really is what's done after the adult population.

448
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:54,120
So you have to really specify package properly to the vaccine, reduce the disease or target.

449
01:05:55,170 --> 01:05:58,440
And, you know, for this particular population.

450
01:05:58,890 --> 01:06:11,120
And that does it to protect against infection among the immunocompromised individuals, old or young children.

451
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:16,350
So you have packaged properly and the formulation and the constituents of vaccine.

452
01:06:16,830 --> 01:06:30,300
And if it's a intradermal vaccine and you have to specify all the answers data, it's only for that particular form of vaccine.

453
01:06:30,630 --> 01:06:41,940
If you are changing the vaccine and no matter those terms or it's the form warfarin, it requires you study.

454
01:06:42,630 --> 01:06:49,920
But in that case, you can definitely also use some of your earlier version.

455
01:06:50,250 --> 01:06:56,670
So of course, this is very important to note and the schedule of administration.

456
01:06:56,970 --> 01:07:07,440
I just mentioned that if with the intradermal vaccine, you can't just take that's a licensure to make your scarification vaccine or free vaccine.

457
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:16,260
And then in the face of free trial, we always have the possibility to to study the different kind of protection.

458
01:07:16,590 --> 01:07:25,230
But you want to understand it's not for a vaccine commission study in direct.

459
01:07:25,410 --> 01:07:28,620
Right. What kind of technology?

460
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:32,530
It's only those the human to human transmission, not creative,

461
01:07:32,730 --> 01:07:39,660
which is to saw you like you don't necessarily have a penis to make sure all the

462
01:07:39,660 --> 01:07:46,170
different type and a selection of appropriate setting and population is very important.

463
01:07:46,740 --> 01:07:52,470
And the first one, for those of you who are working in Cocoa House or even public health,

464
01:07:52,950 --> 01:08:00,960
you should understand how could disease occur and predict properly is important.

465
01:08:01,050 --> 01:08:13,800
Why? Because you design your studies determine you are sample size, the lens of your study based on the disease, the package, the disease incidence.

466
01:08:14,310 --> 01:08:20,400
If you can't predict how many to happen, how can you you you you do.

467
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:26,040
That is a design. So anyone want to work in the vaccine field?

468
01:08:26,490 --> 01:08:33,000
And the first the sense especially of public health people you are involved in immunization.

469
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:40,480
You want to first work on disease surveillance and then you want to have to stay,

470
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:47,610
build stable reports of a disease and a sufficient of the high incidence of package infection.

471
01:08:47,610 --> 01:08:49,710
Of course, this will allow you,

472
01:08:49,890 --> 01:08:59,510
if the higher incidence is to shorten the duration of the trial can be may be defined by age, gender and even behaviors.

473
01:09:01,740 --> 01:09:10,620
So all this makes sense. Yeah. There are many diseases, gender specific, race as.

474
01:09:11,870 --> 01:09:20,960
No. Age specifics and behavior related to some disease health behavior really has a bigger role in transmission.

475
01:09:21,860 --> 01:09:28,470
And so that's the importance of information.

476
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:40,189
You have to face and the backup inform and the firm backing at the local national also backup for local populations the quit research

477
01:09:40,190 --> 01:09:52,450
infrastructure because you have to diagnosis accurately the outcome of reinfection or disease and considering ages specific incidents.

478
01:09:52,910 --> 01:09:58,310
Why all this is important is just to take a look at this this information.

479
01:09:58,610 --> 01:10:08,239
You can see how much of fluctuation that the pieces when they did that corner case vaccine trial

480
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:18,350
uses the population of Bangladesh you can see annual rates of reports every year so fluctuates.

481
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:27,710
That's why you need to you know I have this firm backing for local government to

482
01:10:28,130 --> 01:10:35,630
population and also you can see for different age groups as you see from this slide,

483
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:40,550
that there have very different protective effects.

484
01:10:40,970 --> 01:10:52,160
So this is what I mean. You have to you know, your answer, your specific a research question based on population packet,

485
01:10:52,160 --> 01:11:01,820
the population and the packet of population of giving age group packet, population of giving gender or health behavior.

486
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:07,610
This is just an example. And then I'm also showing you some stuff in follow up.

487
01:11:07,910 --> 01:11:14,240
You can see, you know, the early trial out there different.

488
01:11:14,570 --> 01:11:22,910
You can see at the end completely followed only one thirds and there's just barely one third of the population.

489
01:11:23,270 --> 01:11:31,880
That's why it's when you do the facts and study design, you first want to tweak some.

490
01:11:32,390 --> 01:11:40,140
How how strong they are back up populations and how predictable the disease incidence rates.

491
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:45,920
Otherwise you may end up being a trial you come closer to getting.

492
01:11:48,140 --> 01:11:53,210
And to the detecting and to the final outcome for us to send back some protection,

493
01:11:53,630 --> 01:12:00,530
you could do active and hence the occurrence of trials typically is active.

494
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:03,440
But then post the licensure,

495
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:16,310
you could do a compilation because the pensively it's really not really you go there you based on what's a physician to put you

496
01:12:16,330 --> 01:12:28,310
better active you were probably with the cancer for them may be you know the possibility of under-reporting of heart disease.

497
01:12:28,970 --> 01:12:34,520
This is no different from the the general public health program.

498
01:12:34,940 --> 01:12:41,270
Active surveillance always capture more pieces of interest.

499
01:12:42,020 --> 01:12:52,430
Um, another example here showing you how activities surveillance can identify and.

500
01:12:54,010 --> 01:13:01,930
The outcome of interest that differently. Just the sample server.

501
01:13:01,930 --> 01:13:05,710
So you want to avoid and you lose to follow up.

502
01:13:06,490 --> 01:13:14,770
You know your you were comparative good if they have an even more you can have a

503
01:13:14,770 --> 01:13:23,020
biased assessment and then you could received appropriate diagnosis if you want.

504
01:13:23,020 --> 01:13:27,790
Good for you. Larger device hands of a reporter or other group.

505
01:13:27,790 --> 01:13:33,940
You face an active detection.

506
01:13:34,270 --> 01:13:37,420
That's where you introduce some part that's a different background.

507
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:48,159
Diagnostic evidence of being interpreted with the knowledge of agents at risk saved by study subject this that it's a virus.

508
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:58,480
This is not a tool blinded the study so you can use full indicator condition.

509
01:13:58,870 --> 01:14:02,290
This is also relevant and.

510
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:08,680
You call and diagnosis lets you know.

511
01:14:08,860 --> 01:14:19,000
So basically you want to reduce avoid the detection price by ensure you follow up.

512
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:30,040
You could use for available diagnostics. You could use for surveillance of the outcome of interest that will avoid cancer or.

513
01:14:33,250 --> 01:14:40,940
And when to terminate such trial. Typically is to specify that the design.

514
01:14:41,210 --> 01:14:49,730
But I will tell you the innovative approach basically they can allow to specify server

515
01:14:49,880 --> 01:14:59,030
scenario you can already terminate and it typically will have for early termination.

516
01:14:59,390 --> 01:15:03,970
When you do your clean study a sample summary, pay attention to them.

517
01:15:04,220 --> 01:15:08,090
See if with the has early determination for what reason.

518
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:18,620
I really hope for the collection of the sample gave you much more broad information, the range of information coming to you.

519
01:15:18,620 --> 01:15:28,910
It is a civil vaccine side effect. Okay, until you look at your study sample overwhelming benefits among vaccinated.

520
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:36,010
This could happen sometimes when the disease incidence was the under detected that

521
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:42,800
in the population lack of good evidence and then the under-reported disease.

522
01:15:43,100 --> 01:15:53,630
And then you did develop in your design do a study sample based on those other reports you see but then when you start your trial that accurate well

523
01:15:54,200 --> 01:16:05,440
done surveillance the capture much more so you get to see over women benefits among vaccinated and afterwards the lack of benefits vaccinated.

524
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:11,840
If you don't see any hope when we like to talk about innovative approach,

525
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:18,470
one is to actually have the possibility of adaptive for population selection.

526
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:27,080
If some population shows no hope for what we talked and then you increase the ones that work well.

527
01:16:27,290 --> 01:16:31,959
And so this this is where I want to talk about this part first.

528
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:43,940
The to put quite a context for as a center of discussion and then deciding on approach or assessing immune response to vaccination.

529
01:16:44,270 --> 01:16:52,880
This is the one of very emphasized to date in the innovative approach, which basically is what we call the correlation studies.

530
01:16:53,180 --> 01:17:01,070
Immunogenicity studies for long term immunogenicity was not understood given some successful vaccine,

531
01:17:01,310 --> 01:17:05,540
the specific protective immunity was not well understood.

532
01:17:05,870 --> 01:17:10,969
And the primary portion for long term, this is safety protective effects.

533
01:17:10,970 --> 01:17:14,660
They may share this through disease reduction or infection reduction,

534
01:17:14,900 --> 01:17:27,620
but now immunogenicity became has become part of the primary questions and this is a to document vaccine giving in the trial

535
01:17:27,620 --> 01:17:36,500
elicits a level of response expected to on the basis of studies to determine and immunological correlates of vaccine protection.

536
01:17:37,070 --> 01:17:41,990
What's the advantage of knowing this? We will talk after the.

537
01:17:45,340 --> 01:17:49,150
Break. I think we can we can all summarize basically.

538
01:17:49,690 --> 01:17:52,690
It's all you can understand.

539
01:17:52,690 --> 01:17:57,940
I don't need to read this piece and let's pick up a minute break and come back.

540
01:18:00,290 --> 01:18:43,060
Coming back, starting with your question. It's interesting that.
