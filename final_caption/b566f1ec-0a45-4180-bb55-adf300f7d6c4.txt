1
00:00:01,607 --> 00:00:07,986
Okay, so we are going to be introducing lab for today.

2
00:00:07,986 --> 00:00:10,664
It's an overview of multi varied relationship and

3
00:00:10,664 --> 00:00:12,300
multiple linear regression.

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,670
But before that, we're gonna cover some lab three feedback.

5
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:21,538
So just in general, the GSS have noticed that people have not been incorporating

6
00:00:21,538 --> 00:00:24,843
the feedback that we've been giving into their labs.

7
00:00:24,843 --> 00:00:29,313
So, the default grade is 10 out of 12.

8
00:00:29,313 --> 00:00:32,763
You're like, you generally get three on statistical analysis,

9
00:00:32,763 --> 00:00:36,850
three on graphical analysis, 200 creativity and 200 communication.

10
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:40,237
That gets to a 10 out of 12.

11
00:00:40,237 --> 00:00:45,490
Check your score, look at the rubric see if you're expecting to get 11 out of 12.

12
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:48,779
If you got 10 out of 12 and what you were missing points on or

13
00:00:48,779 --> 00:00:50,499
even if you got 10 out of 12.

14
00:00:50,499 --> 00:00:53,113
Did you get an extra point for creativity and

15
00:00:53,113 --> 00:00:55,591
then lose one on the graphical analysis?

16
00:00:55,591 --> 00:00:58,429
It's we're reading your labs, we're going through your labs,

17
00:00:58,429 --> 00:00:59,646
we're grading your labs and

18
00:00:59,646 --> 00:01:03,261
we're expecting you to make the changes based on the grades that we're giving you.

19
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:08,822
And if you have any questions about how they're graded, please ask.

20
00:01:08,822 --> 00:01:13,399
We would much rather have you asked us questions about your grades and like why,

21
00:01:13,399 --> 00:01:18,140
like what the difference between what you did is and what we were expecting to see.

22
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:22,170
Of course, in a non threatening way.

23
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:28,420
But like definitely don't be afraid to ask where you went wrong?

24
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,321
And then yes.

25
00:01:30,321 --> 00:01:35,673
>> Where is the feedback, because all I see is just like a general.

26
00:01:35,673 --> 00:01:38,957
>> Can I see, cuz your hand looks a little different than mine.

27
00:01:40,498 --> 00:01:47,442
>> Yeah, so this is the you get a rubric.

28
00:01:47,442 --> 00:01:51,600
Normally three, three, two the feedback is the rubric.

29
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,151
So okay.

30
00:01:53,151 --> 00:01:55,676
There's no.

31
00:01:55,676 --> 00:02:00,390
>> Yeah, so if we notice that you're going wrong specifically somewhere, then we'll

32
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:04,392
probably put a comment otherwise we're just gonna fill out the rubric.

33
00:02:04,392 --> 00:02:05,840
Does that make sense?

34
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:11,093
Okay, so then we're also gonna go over the purpose of matt's example lab.

35
00:02:11,093 --> 00:02:15,097
We've noticed that a lot of people are re using the exact same phrases from

36
00:02:15,097 --> 00:02:15,890
Matt's lab.

37
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:21,256
And this is technically plagiarism and a violation of academic integrity.

38
00:02:21,256 --> 00:02:25,762
So, we're just gonna run through an example of what matt had for

39
00:02:25,762 --> 00:02:28,266
his regression analysis section,

40
00:02:28,266 --> 00:02:32,788
I'm gonna talk about how I would think about this and then yeah.

41
00:02:32,788 --> 00:02:35,132
And then we'll get into that for.

42
00:02:35,132 --> 00:02:39,697
So I just copied and pasted what Matt had on his example lab.

43
00:02:39,697 --> 00:02:42,570
These are the two paragraphs for the regression analysis.

44
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:47,605
So looking at this, I see that the two yellow lines, simple linear regression

45
00:02:47,605 --> 00:02:52,884
was used to model unadjusted associations with the telomere length, table two.

46
00:02:52,884 --> 00:02:56,387
And this regression analysis highlights the need to adjust for these factories.

47
00:02:56,387 --> 00:03:00,007
These are both like topic sentences and concluding sentences.

48
00:03:00,007 --> 00:03:02,599
They're introducing the fact that in table two,

49
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:05,640
we're talking about simple unadjusted relationships?

50
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:10,210
And then, the final one is kind of setting up that multiple linear regression

51
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:15,011
adjusting for variables having a bunch of different things going on at one time.

52
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:21,640
And then the blue part is talking about his primary exposure of interest and

53
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,822
the effect of that exposure on the outcome.

54
00:03:24,822 --> 00:03:27,451
The pink part that's other possible confounds,

55
00:03:27,451 --> 00:03:30,410
those are other relationships that we're looking at.

56
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:35,195
So what I would do is I would create a pretty simple outline of

57
00:03:35,195 --> 00:03:37,119
what Matt had written.

58
00:03:37,119 --> 00:03:40,436
Transition, primary exposure of interest in simple linear regression,

59
00:03:40,436 --> 00:03:42,400
secondary variables and then transition.

60
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,947
And I would do this for every piece of his lab.

61
00:03:44,947 --> 00:03:48,761
So take the example lab and then I would abstract out the structure of his writing.

62
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,984
And then I would use that to create my own unique lab.

63
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:58,112
I would not look at his example lab, when I'm writing my own lab,

64
00:03:58,112 --> 00:04:00,740
it needs to be in my own words.

65
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:05,777
Okay, so even having that example lab up like in the same part of my computer.

66
00:04:05,777 --> 00:04:10,850
So I'm looking at it while I'm writing, I never do that because there's the chance

67
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:15,300
that I could see something and just kind of like copy it without thinking.

68
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:20,804
You really wanna make sure that your words are your own and if you're worried

69
00:04:20,804 --> 00:04:26,309
about it making sense or worried about like if you're freezing looks good.

70
00:04:26,309 --> 00:04:28,893
Part of the problem with statistics and writing for

71
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:31,980
statistics is like interpretations are really formulaic.

72
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,660
Everything else is not.

73
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:36,993
So understanding when to use that formulaic interpretation

74
00:04:36,993 --> 00:04:41,000
of a coefficient versus when you should be using your own words is tough.

75
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,372
Bring it to the SPH writing center.

76
00:04:43,372 --> 00:04:46,441
These are people who are trained to help you write and

77
00:04:46,441 --> 00:04:49,390
who are trained to help you write properly, yes.

78
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:53,185
>> So for mine I didn't copy his example word for word,

79
00:04:53,185 --> 00:04:57,430
but I talked about this is what the experiment is about.

80
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:01,574
Then he talked about which rivals are confounding and not confounding and so on.

81
00:05:01,574 --> 00:05:04,935
And so I used some of like the language he used but

82
00:05:04,935 --> 00:05:09,992
I put it in terms of my own like variables in my lab, is that plagiarism.

83
00:05:09,992 --> 00:05:15,852
>> Yeah, so if we go back here, what we were really seeing when we

84
00:05:15,852 --> 00:05:22,418
were grading these is like 90% of people had this exact sentence.

85
00:05:22,418 --> 00:05:25,357
>> [INAUDIBLE].

86
00:05:25,357 --> 00:05:28,319
>> Just like this regression analysis highlights the need to adjust for

87
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:29,041
these factors.

88
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:33,630
Like 90% of the labs had this as their last sentence, that's plagiarism.

89
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:37,922
Even if you're taking a single sentence from what Matt had written,

90
00:05:37,922 --> 00:05:38,960
not citing him.

91
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,612
And then putting it into your lab and claiming it as your own.

92
00:05:42,612 --> 00:05:45,218
>> [INAUDIBLE].

93
00:05:45,218 --> 00:05:49,619
>> Yeah, even if you're just putting in your variables, like if I were to copy and

94
00:05:49,619 --> 00:05:50,354
paste this.

95
00:05:50,354 --> 00:05:53,073
And say I'm doing the embed lab and so

96
00:05:53,073 --> 00:05:57,564
like my exposure is cotton in my responses, homocysteine.

97
00:05:57,564 --> 00:06:02,424
If I were to replace telomere length every single time I saw telomere and

98
00:06:02,424 --> 00:06:06,807
I were to replace it with homocysteine, that's your outcome.

99
00:06:06,807 --> 00:06:10,720
That's still plagiarism, right because all you've done is change one word.

100
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,759
You've still taken the structure of the sentence,

101
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,192
you've still taken what he has written and you're claiming it as your own.

102
00:06:18,192 --> 00:06:20,298
Does that make sense?

103
00:06:20,298 --> 00:06:24,572
Okay, so that's just a heads up.

104
00:06:24,572 --> 00:06:28,862
I don't think anyone's gonna get reported to academic affairs,

105
00:06:28,862 --> 00:06:33,686
I think that's gonna that's gonna send out an email just like reminding,

106
00:06:33,686 --> 00:06:36,307
like let's not plagiarize two people.

107
00:06:36,307 --> 00:06:41,274
So just make sure that when you're writing you're using your own words, even if

108
00:06:41,274 --> 00:06:46,403
you're following the structure, that's fine, you just cannot copy and paste.

109
00:06:46,403 --> 00:06:48,389
And change just a couple of things.

110
00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:51,110
Make sense okay.

111
00:06:53,994 --> 00:06:57,240
Okay, now we're gonna get into lab form.

112
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,757
So, just a reminder of where we've been.

113
00:07:00,757 --> 00:07:04,474
We have graphical analysis that's getting familiar with your data,

114
00:07:04,474 --> 00:07:09,265
descriptive statistics you're getting more concrete characterizations of your data,

115
00:07:09,265 --> 00:07:10,790
this is being recorded too.

116
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:12,191
So you can look back in recording.

117
00:07:12,191 --> 00:07:13,754
Just so you don't have to worry about taking pictures.

118
00:07:13,754 --> 00:07:19,790
It's fine if you wanna take pictures, but I am recording this, it'll be on canvas.

119
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:22,707
So lab three, we did simple linear regressions.

120
00:07:22,707 --> 00:07:26,808
We were looking at the unadjusted relationship between a possible

121
00:07:26,808 --> 00:07:32,093
confounder, something that we had data on our exposure of interest and our outcome.

122
00:07:32,093 --> 00:07:34,890
And we did this for every single one of the variables.

123
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:39,714
It's unadjusted because we aren't taking into account BMI might

124
00:07:39,714 --> 00:07:41,702
change as our age changes.

125
00:07:41,702 --> 00:07:47,452
But how does that effective BMI change if we hold age constant.

126
00:07:47,452 --> 00:07:50,632
Okay, so now lab four we're finally getting to the fun stuff,

127
00:07:50,632 --> 00:07:53,092
we're getting to multiple linear regression.

128
00:07:53,092 --> 00:07:58,188
This is where we're able to adjust for those can founders were

129
00:07:58,188 --> 00:08:03,088
able to control the extra possible effects on our outcome.

130
00:08:03,088 --> 00:08:07,318
Does that make sense, okay.

131
00:08:07,318 --> 00:08:12,287
So, in mathematical language in equations, this is the difference

132
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:17,608
between the theoretical models that we're fitting to our data, right.

133
00:08:17,608 --> 00:08:21,495
We have unadjusted associations over here, there are no extra variables and

134
00:08:21,495 --> 00:08:23,370
we have our adjusted associations.

135
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:27,250
So if our primary exposure of interest is age and

136
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:32,488
our outcome is LDL, we can look at the way that age affects LDL but

137
00:08:32,488 --> 00:08:37,147
we're able to hold BMI gender and smoking all constant.

138
00:08:37,147 --> 00:08:40,553
So, this is one of the great things about multiple linear regression,

139
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:43,220
we're able to control for these extra factors.

140
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:46,602
The interpretations are also slightly different, so

141
00:08:46,602 --> 00:08:50,140
the slope is just the unadjusted effect size on the left.

142
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,942
The slope is adjusting for these things.

143
00:08:52,942 --> 00:08:57,078
So when you're interpreting your coefficient, you wanna include that you

144
00:08:57,078 --> 00:09:01,603
are adjusting for these effects because it does mean different things to adjust and

145
00:09:01,603 --> 00:09:05,691
to control for these variables versus not adjusting and not controlling.

146
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:11,784
Cool, okay.

147
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:15,775
So, we're gonna run through two examples, we're gonna talk about bone blood and

148
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,211
infant mental development.

149
00:09:17,211 --> 00:09:21,269
And we're also going to talk about matt's example, the telomere and

150
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,670
the exercise example.

151
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:27,411
So as a reminder the exposure of interest was lead levels in

152
00:09:27,411 --> 00:09:30,808
umbilical cord blood and maternal bone.

153
00:09:30,808 --> 00:09:34,730
And then the outcome was infant mental development.

154
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:38,464
So, this is just the simple in your aggressions, they're looking at

155
00:09:38,464 --> 00:09:42,648
the bio various relationships between every single one of these variables and

156
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:44,070
the outcome of interest.

157
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:48,127
So you can ask questions like, is the association statistically significant,

158
00:09:48,127 --> 00:09:50,343
what's the direction of the association?

159
00:09:50,343 --> 00:09:55,781
Is it a protective effect or is it a deleterious effect?

160
00:09:55,781 --> 00:09:57,260
And yeah are the significant.

161
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:01,693
So, things to note now when we're gonna run a multiple linear

162
00:10:01,693 --> 00:10:04,771
regression is the relationship the same.

163
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:09,291
And the relationship you can tell is the same as if the coefficient suddenly

164
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:12,391
changes from being positive to negative, right?

165
00:10:12,391 --> 00:10:17,177
Because then all of a sudden an increase in umbilical cord blood level,

166
00:10:17,177 --> 00:10:22,145
might be associated with a decrease in mental development of the infant.

167
00:10:22,145 --> 00:10:27,422
And then if you change that into positive, then an increase in umbilical cord

168
00:10:27,422 --> 00:10:33,400
blood level is associated with an increase in maternal fetal development.

169
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,042
Does that make sense?

170
00:10:34,042 --> 00:10:41,359
That direction matters, changing direction is important still significant.

171
00:10:41,359 --> 00:10:45,884
And then, we note that some of these p values are gonna change

172
00:10:45,884 --> 00:10:48,557
there's another slide here with.

173
00:10:48,557 --> 00:10:53,039
We'll talk about the comparison between by various analysis and

174
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:55,737
multiple linear regressions, okay.

175
00:10:55,737 --> 00:10:59,535
So this is the multiple linear regression model that

176
00:10:59,535 --> 00:11:03,090
was fit in order to get the table that we just saw.

177
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:06,604
And so again, we're asking these questions is the p-value so significant.

178
00:11:06,604 --> 00:11:08,905
What is the percent change in the effect size?

179
00:11:08,905 --> 00:11:12,481
How did the effect change when we control for these other variables?

180
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:16,860
So to compare the top is lab three.

181
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,770
The bottom is lab four simple.

182
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:22,740
Unadjusted regressions versus multiple linear regressions.

183
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:27,351
So we can see that here maternal I.

184
00:11:27,351 --> 00:11:29,208
Q. Is significant and so

185
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:31,510
is mother's years of education.

186
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:34,181
These aren't adjusting for each other but

187
00:11:34,181 --> 00:11:36,861
when we include both in a model maternal I.

188
00:11:36,861 --> 00:11:39,127
Q. Is significant here but

189
00:11:39,127 --> 00:11:42,690
total years of school and the mother is not.

190
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:44,761
So by accounting for I.

191
00:11:44,761 --> 00:11:45,700
Q.

192
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,760
Schooling isn't as significant.

193
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,861
Does that make sense?

194
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:55,681
Okay then we can also see that umbilical cord blood levels actually increases in

195
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:56,691
significance.

196
00:11:56,691 --> 00:11:58,231
That p-value drops.

197
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,960
The effect size gets more negative.

198
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,630
That association increases.

199
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:07,141
Yeah.

200
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,300
Does that make sense?

201
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:12,880
You can also see that 10% rule of thumb that we learned in class.

202
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,130
This is not like a hard and fast.

203
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:18,441
Like you can't walk up if you're to walk up to a statistician or

204
00:12:18,441 --> 00:12:21,580
biostatistician and be like by the 10% rule of thumb.

205
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:26,127
I see that it's in founder like this is just kind of a tool that Matt has given

206
00:12:26,127 --> 00:12:28,011
you it's not like universal.

207
00:12:28,011 --> 00:12:28,941
It's not a theorem.

208
00:12:28,941 --> 00:12:30,651
It's not seen as universal truth?

209
00:12:30,651 --> 00:12:34,220
It's just kind of like something that should raise a red flag for you.

210
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,341
Does that make sense?

211
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:40,870
Okay talked about that.

212
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:42,301
All right. So your lab for

213
00:12:42,301 --> 00:12:47,710
goal is to create a table similar to this with the multiple linear regression.

214
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:49,589
So fit one regression and

215
00:12:49,589 --> 00:12:54,530
then include the adjusted effect sizes and P values in the table.

216
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:55,390
And then compare.

217
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:59,476
So actually think about the difference between your multiple linear regression

218
00:12:59,476 --> 00:13:01,771
and all of those single in your aggressions.

219
00:13:01,771 --> 00:13:02,561
What changes?

220
00:13:02,561 --> 00:13:03,520
What's different?

221
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,090
Why is it different?

222
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:09,251
These are things that you can be thinking about and including in your write up.

223
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,130
Alright.

224
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:14,720
Last example we're gonna think about the telomeres.

225
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,566
So the exposure is vigorous physical activity and

226
00:13:18,566 --> 00:13:21,501
then telomere length is the outcome.

227
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:27,270
So here are the simple in your aggressions.

228
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:30,870
We can look at vigorous exercise and moderate exercise.

229
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:32,911
These are the exposures of interest.

230
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:35,760
Alright.

231
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,211
And then here is the comparison table.

232
00:13:38,211 --> 00:13:40,191
So this is what we want you guys to be creating.

233
00:13:40,191 --> 00:13:43,310
We have the unadjusted associations and the adjusted associations.

234
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:45,605
And then you can compare the effect size and

235
00:13:45,605 --> 00:13:48,880
you see that the effect size of vigorous exercise actually.

236
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,710
Think about it.

237
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:54,080
It decreases.

238
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,341
It increases in p-value.

239
00:13:56,341 --> 00:13:57,811
So it decreases in significance.

240
00:13:57,811 --> 00:14:02,390
But it's still significant At α is .5.

241
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:03,190
Okay.

242
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:05,851
And then let's see what else changes.

243
00:14:05,851 --> 00:14:10,758
We can see that smoking that affects us flip flops from being positive

244
00:14:10,758 --> 00:14:15,681
to negative from being super significant to not super significant.

245
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:23,470
there is a 71% change that's much much larger than 10%.

246
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:25,070
Okay.

247
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:28,621
And then we noticed that smoking also changes.

248
00:14:28,621 --> 00:14:29,660
And so does education.

249
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,901
All of those education.

250
00:14:30,901 --> 00:14:35,807
Categorical variables on the left are pretty statistically significant

251
00:14:35,807 --> 00:14:36,770
on the right.

252
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:37,961
Not so much.

253
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,130
Okay.

254
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:44,130
So what we want to see happen in the body of your report,

255
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:46,500
this is gonna be the more formulated part.

256
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,380
You're gonna be interpreting a coefficient.

257
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:53,670
There are very specific ways that interpreting a coefficient you want to do.

258
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:57,270
Because the language that we use in interpreting coefficients matters.

259
00:14:57,270 --> 00:15:01,960
Talking about the average predicted outcome is different than the predicted

260
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,121
average outcome.

261
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:09,411
Okay so here is the interpretation that matt has.

262
00:15:09,411 --> 00:15:13,719
He talks here, he does an interpretation and then he talks about the change from

263
00:15:13,719 --> 00:15:17,690
simple and their aggression to multiple linear regression.

264
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:20,702
So when I'm writing my report I will include an interpretation and

265
00:15:20,702 --> 00:15:23,690
I will talk about that change and maybe why that change happened.

266
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:25,141
what I would suspect.

267
00:15:25,141 --> 00:15:29,601
Maybe further questions that it leads to as a researcher, does that make sense?

268
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,181
Okay.

269
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,310
He hits on a couple of things in his interpretation.

270
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:38,681
We get that adjusted part after controlling for age, sex, B.

271
00:15:38,681 --> 00:15:39,920
M. I. And smoking status.

272
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,758
Sorry. We get the direction of the effect and

273
00:15:42,758 --> 00:15:45,271
we get the significance of the effect.

274
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:47,870
Okay.

275
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:49,020
Final comments.

276
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,980
Make sure you get your lab reports in on time.

277
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,300
They do.

278
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,700
I believe the 15th of december.

279
00:15:54,700 --> 00:16:01,470
Matt has 48 hours after the final exam is scheduled to get your final grades in.

280
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:04,521
So if you can get them in on time, it will really help the G.

281
00:16:04,521 --> 00:16:05,051
S. I. S.

282
00:16:05,051 --> 00:16:06,720
Because we're trying to help out matt.

283
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,650
There are 270 people.

284
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:13,608
So yeah, just really have that deadline in the head top of your mind and

285
00:16:13,608 --> 00:16:18,990
then taking a broader look at what we've done this entire semester is we've

286
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:24,150
basically gone through the process of performing data analysis right?

287
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:27,340
You made a ton of plots in your first lap.

288
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:30,274
There's a lot of coding that you did for that first lab and

289
00:16:30,274 --> 00:16:32,190
then you kind of just got rid of them.

290
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:37,144
, even talking to people like most of the work that I've done for

291
00:16:37,144 --> 00:16:43,600
my analysis in bio test classes has been graph after graph after graph after graph.

292
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,160
And like we don't use any of them.

293
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,278
But just understanding that you need to understand what your data looks like and

294
00:16:50,278 --> 00:16:54,211
then you get your descriptive statistics, you run your hypothesis tests,

295
00:16:54,211 --> 00:16:59,070
you run all these tests and then you're summarizing it in a good solid lab report.

296
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:02,020
And there are a ton of more statistical techniques.

297
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,800
We've kind of just dipped our toes in.

298
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:09,930
But hopefully this gets you more familiar with what happens with lab reports.

299
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:11,819
Does that make sense?

300
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:13,349
All right.

301
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:14,981
You guys can go ahead and get started.

302
00:17:14,981 --> 00:17:17,301
If you have any questions, just holler and I'll be over.

303
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,021
Okay?
