1
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:09,080
So we know that in the United States, we talk about a lot of poverty.

2
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:13,020
We focus mostly to asking what subject?

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:19,690
Water and. Do you want to go on?

4
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:25,050
So can you want to really go near the water quality of the water?

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:35,820
So lakes, rivers, streams, by then the Safe Drinking Water Act when it comes to the water quality of drinking water.

6
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:42,019
So how about the border wall that we are dealing with?

7
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:54,830
One, one of the effects. As a matter of fact, we use a tremendous amount of light, especially if you go to the southwest, Arizona and California.

8
00:00:55,400 --> 00:01:03,050
This these places we use a tremendous amount with 114 different tips every hour over here, every hour over here.

9
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:10,220
We also use global. And the source part of the for drinking water.

10
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:16,070
In other cases like the I can't remember which small town in Michigan.

11
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:22,760
The last is the company who was a bottle of the bottled water here and they transported to the other states.

12
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,650
They pay, you know how much they pay for it to go? A lot.

13
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:35,520
No, they don't pay for it. Like $100, $200 for the license fee.

14
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,000
For the registration fee. And they can just pump the water.

15
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:48,240
Okay, because the war here in the United States, basically the surface oil of water is free.

16
00:01:50,630 --> 00:02:00,620
Okay. So if you came upon the water, water like for a house, you pump the ground water and the water, you don't pay for it.

17
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:11,350
But the really careful. Okay. So that circumferences that inhibits, we need to try to figure out probably the best way for that.

18
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:19,390
But anyway, so. In the United States, not to mention the other part of the world, big cities.

19
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,030
They rely heavily on warm water.

20
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:33,280
One of the example is that in in Peru, in Lima, in the city, they just this egg trucks that were water from different locations.

21
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:44,080
And then if you cannot really find it and then they need to find another way of finding other locations to do it in the in the Qatar,

22
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:51,489
the other Arab countries, why would people try to move on different locations if that's when they sit on the island?

23
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:55,670
One location they were be aware. As one of the key leaders.

24
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:00,500
And then they use the water. Until the word come out.

25
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:06,620
We are. And then they move to another location. Is that because they want to move?

26
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:14,020
Do they have to move? It's not only just the one where they have to move because the water is essential.

27
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:19,450
If they don't have the water, they cannot survive. So that's really the reason for this.

28
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:25,450
In the culture, as recruits, they have to move around, rely on water.

29
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:39,340
Okay. So so he's about but so how they how do we really manage the water quality in the United States if we don't have this statue,

30
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,560
make the Clean Water Act governing the water.

31
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:51,549
So for this does try to see what is the ground water that's always the water helps with

32
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:58,480
within the integrated openings of such a rock beneath the land surface beneath the surface.

33
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:03,160
So here is a post water table here.

34
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:08,080
And then this is unconfined aquifers. And then we also have the confined aquifer.

35
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:14,880
So you can see here all these or here it's stems Cornwall basically under the ground as that's

36
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:19,930
the groundwater and then the surface of the water here you can see the lakes or streams rivers.

37
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:31,630
So that were the source of the groundwater mostly is from the precipitation that pass through this and then get into the ground.

38
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:36,339
So that's the record groundwater basically, or aquifers.

39
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:41,770
Aquifers is basically a large piece of the water, but they are surrounded by the rocks and the.

40
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:54,410
Okay. Under the gun. So there's a aquifers here for rays on the grounds that some unconfined they

41
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:59,780
may have direct connection with the with the streams with the with the rivers,

42
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:06,649
with the streams. And then what you can see here, you can also have this if you do the wells of what can come out,

43
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:16,129
depend on the pressure sometimes up where you see the spring of the on the on the London area because of the the opening the wells open.

44
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:22,730
It's the pressure is higher from this side through the water here is confined by the ending of the pressure to pressure the water.

45
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:33,900
I mean, you have the streets of the streets. So that's how we how we do it, how we do it.

46
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:41,460
And then this some of the whales, for example, here, they say they have to literally have the spring of the wall will come out.

47
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:46,140
But some locations, some of the locations, we don't really have that kind of pressure.

48
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:51,690
What do you do in other places in this case? But most of the time you have a.

49
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:56,970
Family used to have the precious war so often.

50
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:06,660
That's how we we gave up one war. So there's a lot of states dependent on the rocks.

51
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:12,960
We describe how much water is there and then think about porosity permeability.

52
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:21,840
Many times the in many occasions the water is confined area of a confined area.

53
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,980
There's not much exchange.

54
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:37,470
There's not to open water for them. The streams, rivers, the the repressed curiosity or even like like for example, even for the Great Lakes,

55
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:43,839
that we know that some of the Great Lakes like this area, the Heidelberg Teaching time is one year.

56
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,749
It's about a year. All the water was replaced by Lake Superior.

57
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:53,310
Could be 100 years. Okay. But for the girls, it could be much longer than that.

58
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:57,390
I mean, it depends on where they are and what's opening up.

59
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:03,660
It may take several months for them to to repress the water, to refresh that water.

60
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:07,740
So the hydraulic retention time could be much, much longer.

61
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:13,840
So most of the warm water come from these precipitation.

62
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:19,240
And then you can also discharge and the springs, for example.

63
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:24,190
And so what happens, you can see here you have the precipitation, the water come,

64
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:30,070
and then they come here and then the discharge could connect to the river, to the lakes,

65
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:35,620
and everything is under the surface of the water can go to the to the river and surface,

66
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:41,550
and that we can if you go to the caves, some, some some places, you have caves, closely related caves.

67
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:48,730
But I think that's going on through the water with pass through through the through the through the other areas to the other areas.

68
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:54,170
And we talk about the saltwater in Turin.

69
00:07:54,190 --> 00:08:02,300
Basically, we have the coastal erosion effect and the the seawater can penetrate into the groundwater.

70
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:08,830
So in coastal areas and you what you have may not be just the freshwater or the flooding effect.

71
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:19,240
You have the saltwater there. See, especially now with sea level rise, there's a lot of seawater actually get to these areas.

72
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:32,110
Okay. So 20 about 30% of the world's surface water is stored in aquifers.

73
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:38,900
So and then about 25%, one quarter of the freshwater withdrawal in the United States.

74
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:47,600
Agriculture continue about two thirds. So agriculture's use to source.

75
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:54,860
From Grandma has increased from 4542 in 2020 2000.

76
00:08:55,250 --> 00:09:02,540
One of the problem now with the increase of the population size, now we have 8 billion people.

77
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:07,610
We have the children. Now what can we do to make the food good?

78
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:12,380
So that's agriculture use was was increasing also quite dramatically.

79
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:22,960
85 population obtained the drinking water from public supplies like arable city water up to 20.

80
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:27,610
About 50% rely on the whales. Okay.

81
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,160
But even with public water supplies, almost 40% of funds going to war.

82
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:39,950
Okay. From the ground. That's pretty, pretty high. So we use a tremendous amount of the ground water, basically.

83
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:49,409
So if you look at is the withdrawal by the US in the US, but comparing the two states,

84
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:55,950
a result that we're talking about is that south, west and then Michigan, the total wisdom meaning gallon per day.

85
00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:01,040
For the public a surprise and then irrigation.

86
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:05,740
If you look at the irrigation, really use 88% for the irrigation.

87
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:12,160
And then the Michigan we just use like most for very one fifth.

88
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:20,200
About one fifth. So we use the last. Groundwater for the tap water supplies, good people with supplies.

89
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:23,260
But now you'll see in terms of the amount,

90
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:30,340
we just like one fifth of the Arizona for the withdrawal because luckily we have all the fresh water here in Michigan.

91
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:37,000
Okay. In Michigan. But in the in the in the U.S. is how much water we.

92
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,870
We withdraw from the grant. So basically that means.

93
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:48,090
The US, the French, our countries rely heavily on World War.

94
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:54,230
Okay. You may proceed. Every night in Michigan here, we have a tremendous amount of fresh water.

95
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:59,170
But it was during spring water for different people. Get to an appropriate.

96
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:08,440
And if you've got to major aquifers don't need to participate.

97
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:17,860
If you have that groundwater once in a different location and then different parts of this is big aquifers that you can think of in the United States.

98
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:25,190
And here's some like how much water you have in the ground, basically.

99
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:29,600
This is part of the water cycle here in terms of a huge amount of water.

100
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:35,770
Star. So when we talk about the water distribution, in fact, the fresh water,

101
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:42,100
a large amount of socially stored in the world is not very easily accessible to the surface water.

102
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:56,150
We have. So we have a full stretch of the Gulf War supplies like intentional use disposal and the spills leakage of industrial other chemicals.

103
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:03,630
Or excessive withdrawal. We'll talk about this information. But excessive withdrawal is another issue.

104
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:11,040
We have some obesity that doesn't make it because that withdrawal, fast amount of water is the water never drops.

105
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:14,700
And that's the key. Also, sugar drops us. We're.

106
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:23,110
When you have the in the in the in the Middle West one of the states economic

107
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:29,120
technically what happened is that because they rely heavily on the groundwater water

108
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,920
to irrigation and basically the withdraws use the wells to withdraw the water

109
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:40,610
and and they because the level of the when the water level drops dramatically.

110
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:49,510
So the closer the the. The fall of the soil must get to the state.

111
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:54,530
How to give the farmers to stop using warm water for irrigation for agriculture.

112
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:59,750
We will compensation if we stop our taxes. Okay.

113
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:05,270
So basically you keep the land, you don't grow any crops, don't use the water there.

114
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:10,540
We will give you the money. If we don't do that. Okay.

115
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:14,570
So that's the the the some some some issues that we have.

116
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:20,980
So what if the contamination may have in terms of the the groundwater here?

117
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:30,490
Relatively speaking, we know the the groundwater it's registered a more stable than the surface of the water the surface the water.

118
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:37,600
It's the amount of actually perhaps involved with the groundwater.

119
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:40,990
We have the filtration sewer for you. Okay.

120
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:45,190
If it is of every the bottle through the soil they have, remove the contaminants.

121
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:53,120
But we have much more explosive potential contamination to pollute our groundwater.

122
00:13:53,140 --> 00:14:02,680
So if you look at sewer lines, the municipal sewage system, because of the leakage, the pipes, crack pipes all the time.

123
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:15,180
And then we have these factories. And then we have the the the the fertilizer, the open use and agriculture fertilizer.

124
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:22,170
They can also get into the ground. And then we also have the deep injection wells on mines and then fields.

125
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:27,000
So now it's illegal to file online.

126
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:34,530
And then it feels because whatever it is, they can get into the ground and they can the Cornwall.

127
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:43,250
So there's multiple source can contaminate our ground, although they have the soil layer of the soil to protect them.

128
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:47,300
But still they could skip. And some places, for example, they try to.

129
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:56,020
Because deep injection wells kick the world into the blood and they inject some of these contaminants into a few.

130
00:14:56,890 --> 00:15:01,670
And like nuclear waste. Okay. Although if you are stretched, you try to avoid it.

131
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:05,060
But, you know, this is always an issue. Okay.

132
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:17,480
Um, and and it's some, some people have this crazy idea that we could just do this and let's dig the wells and put all the see you all like.

133
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:25,380
They're just without tremendous effort to do that. That's a very stupid idea to grow war.

134
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:28,530
What happened is that when you get contaminated.

135
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:37,840
It's not a surface the one and we have. Sometimes we have a solution by dilution and we have this kind of deployment of.

136
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:44,440
Because the hydraulic weakness and we still know the repairs takes a very, very long time.

137
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:49,060
If you have through pollution and then the ground will be very difficult to treat.

138
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:51,520
What? Talk about the kiss we've seen over case studies.

139
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:59,529
So we have this effluent from the West contaminating storage, different source of groundwater contamination.

140
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:04,920
You can you can. You can think of. Radioactive waste disposal.

141
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:09,180
Some others. Transportation. Leaking. Oil pipelines.

142
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:13,760
Is a big issue in the Michigan might 95.

143
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:21,540
Okay. So under the magnetic strait on the bridge is a lifetime.

144
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:30,210
That's always a topic for the debates, a controversy in terms what can you do with this?

145
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:37,350
So how can we make sure that there's no if the pipes break, what can we do?

146
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:43,980
And then we do have this all night cabinets broken with a kind of Missouri, both of them.

147
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:51,930
The Kalamazoo River once was contaminated with oil from the mines, from the voice of oil pipelines.

148
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:55,250
Okay. And that's that's just.

149
00:16:55,890 --> 00:17:05,400
And then the BP following chemical spill followed actors and the other activity, agriculture, non-point source, mining and also infiltration.

150
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:12,240
So mining, what we are doing here in the states, United States for the oil or gas.

151
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:21,820
What do we have? We. With approach common practice modified to give the oil gas from fracking.

152
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,360
I have fracking. As a new technology.

153
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:35,570
They try to inject the chemicals to break the boats and the pressure and they come out that the oil and gas come up with fresh.

154
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:46,560
They use tons of. But if we think about one point, one point, and that if EPA does not regret it, is it because it.

155
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:55,420
With this industry founded. It's common practice. They inject the water with the chemicals and they come high pressure,

156
00:17:55,420 --> 00:18:04,210
tried to break the logs and then try to because it produces a blast and the oil can come up and that's very effective.

157
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:12,520
If you think about global oil contamination as a big source of one fourth of all the measured and because we occasionally use that.

158
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:19,350
Okay. You occasionally do that. So that's the money and the oil extraction.

159
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,800
That's that's really in the these areas.

160
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:27,220
Think about the what the the the pollution.

161
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:33,040
Several times in the remote area, we know that they are not of the sanitation system.

162
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:40,540
They use septic tanks. They also contribute to the to the contamination of the groundwater and the ongoing storage tanks.

163
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:49,660
So several times, even a house, depending on the house, really do some a monitoring inspection, but is not sufficient enough.

164
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:59,449
A search and a wristwatch just pulled out. Talk about Westworld for the set solid and the last humans disposed of and one of

165
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:04,690
the way they choose to do the the implication and then that can continue our our.

166
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:11,180
Gwen Moore and then Sony's waste disposal, especially landfills, for example,

167
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:17,920
if it's not carwash or if it's not mines, and then you can also contaminate our formula.

168
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:26,280
So that's for me. So if you think about the source of global contamination of estates, most likely is from storage tanks on the storage tanks.

169
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:31,390
This system that field spills fertilizer application of the.

170
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:42,640
Sources of both the water contamination. In many states, storage tanks on the ground, storage tanks to oil gas they use in septic system.

171
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:47,880
Support system from individuals. That feels so.

172
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:59,750
What the contaminants were. Can contaminants aromatic hydrocarbon oxygen, hydrocarbon, hydrocarbon metals, nonmetal some have a lot of micrograms.

173
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:05,540
And the radio nucleotides, the the the contaminants you can't you can find.

174
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:12,110
So in the United States about. Contaminants.

175
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:19,400
About 400,000 to those size, and it's about 4000 Superfund sites.

176
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:31,040
And then and this is the EPA, the states, the federal government's still being tried to clean up these sites that have been contaminated.

177
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:38,810
So what happens? What happens is, you know, this industry, we have the manufacturing plants industry.

178
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:45,270
And the mining. So what you do when they are in the business,

179
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:52,480
then explore these resources and then then they left that left and then time they

180
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:56,950
just discuss all this science and sometimes the storage is really still there.

181
00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:01,700
There's still a view that all the. Okay.

182
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:08,250
Now, who were in charge of the. Who want to up beside the government.

183
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:13,820
The federal government now step in to do it. So but that's about resources.

184
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:19,880
So if you define as a Superfund site, I knew the federal government would help you to come up with some.

185
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:30,310
But you have to the city. Q But if it's defined as a Superfund site and the property value drops dramatically.

186
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:40,670
Kind of like Love Canal. So because you just go because the people's view of the military forces is contending.

187
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:46,660
So Ann Arbor, one of the sites, we are still alive, still there.

188
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:52,400
Open sites like developed as the ideal positive percent.

189
00:21:53,780 --> 00:22:00,740
So I object to the river is a site with a railway station, a pretty big open space.

190
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:09,890
It used to be three sites. One of the top. One of the reasons they have not been fully developed yet is because of once contamination.

191
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:14,540
And then they haven't really been able to get to that first.

192
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:20,240
If you need to back. You have to you have to go first and that's to get up.

193
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:25,640
I mean, no one wants to do that. But doesn't it depend on, like what you develop there?

194
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:29,540
So the place to go, that's a really location, perfect location.

195
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:34,840
So they try to make it a commercial and residential. So they have to you have connected.

196
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:38,960
But it's only like a certain depth, right? Yes. Okay.

197
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:46,730
So, I mean, surely if you think about the contaminants and then you have the $1 trillion, now is not enough.

198
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:58,850
Okay. One of the examples here in terms of the perchlorates contamination in the ground basically of used

199
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:05,240
to find in the California just use the example of the sea was the contamination in the groundwater.

200
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:14,180
California California because California is one of the location they would use and they become the concern.

201
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:20,360
So again, but you can afford to do a lot of monitoring to identify the perchlorate from this site.

202
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:28,160
But if you look at the groundwater in the different states, you probably will find them in eastern states and in Michigan.

203
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:38,620
Yet where we we we we also find them. But if you think about is a pufas from the pufas here, the Michigan, you see the map of the past.

204
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:44,320
You'll see probably much in this. Sides here finds the reason for that.

205
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:47,580
Could we test them? Okay. It's not like we have nausea.

206
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:53,430
So it's basically the idea. So basically what we can see full coverage is really a lot of locations.

207
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:58,650
The ground water is contaminated with perchlorate because with the use, the heavy use.

208
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:07,420
Okay. Let's take a quick break. We'll talk about the what do we do in the United States to protect the country for a lot of.

209
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,720
So for commercial use, if they have to clean up the ground.

210
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:32,820
Is that like. Only six inches that.

211
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:37,020
I'm not Newt. I don't know the specifics. I need to check to see what this is.

212
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:45,660
But is this some kind of code? There's no like the laws that guided that this is regulations policy.

213
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:50,280
From this, you get that ability. So you need to have this code.

214
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:59,230
They happen to. Okay. And that's that's an interesting one.

215
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:05,420
Talk about the case study. Let's see. The case study is syndication, but it's not like just another.

216
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:11,350
But in fact, basically, you see a lot of cases take the data and especially in industrial areas,

217
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:17,530
mining areas where historically we don't really pay attention to this.

218
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:23,830
So then we have all these sites get contaminated because over the last couple of years downriver,

219
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:32,410
there's been I think it used to be an industrial site and they want to turn it into like an international shipping site.

220
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:38,820
And if they depending on how they permitted or whatever, they would only have to clean.

221
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:42,250
I think it was no more than six inches. Oh, okay.

222
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:54,550
Yeah. Yeah. Which I know probably wouldn't do much, but it's difficult to do basically because the last year, I mean,

223
00:25:54,570 --> 00:26:03,320
in the United States, for a community, if you are looking for these kind of sites, what you do, what you do is make a.

224
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:05,620
A tiny job. Yeah.

225
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:16,720
To do it because when a more expensive so and I love quizzically part of the side is for me the legacy society is just the industry they

226
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:26,620
develop the discussion if you see to some of these remote areas it does with you and then every choice Google you'll see a lot of these sites.

227
00:26:27,310 --> 00:28:44,490
We just come around to go see that site. I think.

228
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:26,900
Okay. So what do we do in the United States to protect the groundwater?

229
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:32,250
And anyone any can think of any. Anything you already have on your mind.

230
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:38,040
We have the protection, which was true when we could take out foreign water.

231
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:46,280
We took over already because. That was in the safe water and safe drinking water sectors.

232
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:53,000
If you use groundwater a source of your drinking water, you have to take the.

233
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:58,010
The 71 act already defines that. So.

234
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:01,470
So that's one. If you if you use one $0.40.

235
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:05,550
Okay. But if you don't, then there's no safe to.

236
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:09,620
To agree with officer. Okay. Only if you do that.

237
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:14,780
So. Which is important also.

238
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:18,540
So basically in the United States, a lot of agencies,

239
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:25,810
quite a few agencies from the local level to the to the federal level, they have some programs to protect the groundwater.

240
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:34,940
And many MEPA is one of the key agencies to prevent adverse effects to the human health and

241
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:41,390
the environment and to protect the integrity of the national great groundwater resources.

242
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:49,700
So they have different programs. The the wellhead program on under on the ground injection control, fuel source aquifers,

243
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:54,290
pesticide, groundwater, state management plan and the Safe Drinking Water Act for that.

244
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:58,810
One of the example here is the underwater injection control program.

245
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:11,810
Into the the the ongoing disapproval is very it's pretty common practice is that TARP injects

246
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:22,580
the wealth and then either explore the resources or you try to try to stop the the West.

247
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:27,470
That's the problem. So the five course injection was.

248
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:32,000
Particular salt water by a different categories in the United States.

249
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:38,730
How these programs say, yes, you can you can dig the wells, but you have to protect them.

250
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:43,350
So you have taken measures to protect based on the category of these wells.

251
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:51,990
Okay. So so the EPA had these so-called cores on the ground injection control program for that.

252
00:31:53,860 --> 00:32:08,490
Okay for that. And then EPA and the D.O.D. effect has been doing quite a lot of work because duty and duty is a big problem.

253
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:15,220
Okay. Think about it. You can be the recruiter for the war.

254
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:23,090
But a lot of sites say that we find victims of perchlorate and outside of duty size.

255
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:31,810
Okay. So how do we clean them? Now, how do we have the physical control mirrors some in situ.

256
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:36,930
I mean if you could permit now if the Superfund site you.

257
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:46,720
Okay. You need to take them and use them. I would give you a case study with Amber to see who I mean.

258
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:53,509
What can we do, really? At some future technology where war criminals remove treatment and they will have the

259
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:59,540
source of removal and the soil flush soil vapor technology or a spy gene technology.

260
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:03,620
So the different engineering has different technology to try to remove the contamination from the ground.

261
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:09,020
Okay. For this pump and treat, this is another way.

262
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:22,230
Just pump the water out and then treat them for the system like we haven't come out see was that was a patent for that was it was I stand for

263
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:32,590
is a low intensity volatile compounds that can flow advance some of other nature and enhance the infusion remediation measure attenuation.

264
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:38,940
So in the grant everyone think about the groundwater right so it's more content.

265
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:44,460
So I just mentioned the rotation of the water takes a very long time.

266
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:49,680
So we don't have the pollution factor. And danger of contamination.

267
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:54,440
The kids really at all times. Get rid of them. Although we also have this volumes.

268
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:59,420
Like all you need to be able to degrade is something contaminant particles most of the time.

269
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:09,450
So the contaminant basically when you contaminate the quarter water, which takes years, years to come back, sometimes just never can come back.

270
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:15,880
Okay. Maybe we can come back. So. So this is the technology sometimes we use.

271
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:22,640
So for example, if I was comparing aquifer here, have the groundwater here you have contaminated.

272
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:27,080
Okay, if I was a contaminated. So basically you were pure.

273
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:30,560
This was to cut off and then you extract the water.

274
00:34:30,890 --> 00:34:35,050
Withdraw the water here, the wells. And then you shouldn't.

275
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:41,980
We'll get you to them. I went through them. You inject them back again to the ground.

276
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:54,980
So here you can see the groundwater here trying to get the one out from the ground and then treat them and then take them back into the ground.

277
00:34:57,830 --> 00:35:02,090
It's already very difficult. To treat our surface water is easier.

278
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:08,570
It's easier to do with your back with clean water. You can imagine the cost quite a lot to do it.

279
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:14,720
So some of this also was like if you what do you can do here.

280
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:26,810
The of the leaking tanks. So again you build a where and then you can try to capture them and then withdraw them and then you have the treatment.

281
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:30,800
So we know we have a lot of. Underneath on the ground.

282
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:35,300
Tanks, storage tanks, gear. Sometimes leaking is avoidable.

283
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:46,950
Basically, leaking is unavoidable. So that's the technology has been used to try to prove to me of the the the the the

284
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:50,630
one or two we can see it's going to take a long time to get the resources to do it.

285
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:58,720
And so basically a lot of locations, sites are intended as just the new one.

286
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:03,070
Take care of this. Do I think about it? But it's just too costly. Okay.

287
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:06,760
Because it it's a very difficult to change. So.

288
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:12,340
So that's really concerned me when we have the fracking technology come out.

289
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:17,500
It's easier to give a guest house. But if you think about the global emission.

290
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:21,940
That's not a good idea. That's not really the ideal for this.

291
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:32,800
So a quick study, we and some of you probably heard of it already for taxing contamination in the.

292
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:43,920
This is a German corporation they used to manufacture the medical filters is pretty big a

293
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:48,840
manufacturer at that time and now every now but now they bought by some other companies.

294
00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:52,660
So that becomes a whole life sciences team.

295
00:36:52,750 --> 00:37:01,090
What's the new name of the company that the merged two other company now is not called Gelman or Paul Lifesciences anymore.

296
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:13,590
It's called D Star. We do have. Could do something that one of the companies vice president for technology is my friends who my running buddy,

297
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:22,350
we run together and I always chatted with him about this issue and he said, Oh, we do all the work we try to clean up.

298
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:27,540
But no. Okay. So what I did was I was at home.

299
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:33,380
They do the manufacture, they use the vaccine for that. Okay.

300
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:41,650
But I actually for this for the medical field or the user all the time, they use the goods to store the Westlaw.

301
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:50,230
Okay. The lagoon was filled with water without my. So all these chemicals get into the pot.

302
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:54,610
Let's get you to the west side of this.

303
00:37:55,930 --> 00:38:06,120
In the mid 1980s, they found this Nike Air Max and the whales and the sport in the water has no water tied to petitions.

304
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:16,360
The soil generally isn't reacting with water. Okay. So they have some issues could be potential be to human probably human casualties.

305
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:22,030
That's when they find it. This becomes the issue and then they the US a company to treat them.

306
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:30,040
Okay so this is the here is the location we wanna do some way somewhere here that's where they get the contamination.

307
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:34,750
So this is a branch. These are nine here.

308
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:40,930
I mean, I don't know whether you're familiar with this location. It's based on the west side of Ann Arbor, 94.

309
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:56,440
And the D used to be this area is I mean, the Fonz remote area like in the eighties, in the sixties and now I mean, highly, heavily developed.

310
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:01,000
So you see the Raiders, you see the the the the Cadila.

311
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:08,620
There's a lot of candidates in this area. And then we we knew somewhere here, I think that somewhere here.

312
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:14,350
But we are in a civil war. So what happens here? Here, this groundwater is going to continue to do so.

313
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:18,210
Now they try to see what can we do with an ambush? What can we do with that?

314
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:27,720
So they tried to take care of these. Now put all these wells around this area, try to train the water to test for the vaccine to see what happened.

315
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:30,610
Can we can what? How how quickly they diffused.

316
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:40,000
So what they want to do is really say, we want to make sure to have the treatment agreement with a company to do the treatment to contain them.

317
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:43,860
So that this is a red line we're talking about. Okay.

318
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:50,640
Try to contain them within this area. That's that's the the this is is like 2060.

319
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:59,880
So we want to keep these. Though, the contamination in this area, within this area with this rain.

320
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:03,470
And so here you can see the bottom part is somewhere here.

321
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:09,200
That's the source for the drinking water. So we don't want to really want to the the risk contaminate from there to zero.

322
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:14,030
But here you can see all this red is here somewhere here threatened.

323
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:24,040
The astrology of this area above 94 that's that's also out there could be getting contaminated.

324
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:31,760
So we've got more and this area and of this area they don't really have the we are not trying to the city on the on the will's.

325
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:41,959
Okay. On the world. So they start to remediate in this area as a basic and this is the technology they are

326
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:46,430
using that time as the department of I'm the quality oversee the remediation projects.

327
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:51,770
So what they do again they. Pump out of the water.

328
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:56,290
Okay. Pump up the groundwater here and into the treatment.

329
00:40:56,470 --> 00:41:04,510
The treatments they have, the sodium sulfide, sodium hydroxide, and then they have the hydrogen hydroxide, hydroxide peroxide.

330
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:11,620
This is that way. And you realize basically you use a very strong oxidants type oxidizes in the water.

331
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:18,680
So this is what I do. Okay? This is what I do. And then this is the show.

332
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:24,140
And then they can discharge them back again. And then to try to discharge to the.

333
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:32,780
To the creek here, the honey creek here. So people are concerned about this thing, you know, where they can do it.

334
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:38,300
And secondly, it's really now you just get to the rivers. The streams will contaminate the rivers, fumes.

335
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:43,000
So this technology rules the world.

336
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:48,670
But to slow. Very positive.

337
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:54,510
Think about it. Like, do you want to leave the movie with you already?

338
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:58,740
But now you try to give it one and then do the treatments, the same treatments.

339
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:00,810
You spend that money for this.

340
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:07,740
So the company surely said, Yeah, we do the work, we do the demonstration projects, but they don't really do a full scale treatment.

341
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:12,040
Which I try to make sure that, okay, be cute.

342
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:17,610
All the people come here to see what, you know, working out, which I tried to do to, to, to, to do the work.

343
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:32,630
So. So that's also the reason what you can see here is the diffuse diffuse into these areas already to get across that red light.

344
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:37,880
So this is what they are doing. So what can we do? Think about it.

345
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:44,590
Think about it. So what can we do with this situation? Who are responsible.

346
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:53,510
SCHULKE The company actually the company continue to treat.

347
00:42:54,920 --> 00:43:00,770
Okay, that's for sure. But the company says, I don't have the money to do it.

348
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:06,870
I mean, I think I'm. Right?

349
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:11,190
I mean, you just they we we we filed the bankruptcy.

350
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:19,990
By the company that will verify that this is a pretty good company that you and me,

351
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:27,470
as the future is a company used by many medical medical fields to produce these products.

352
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:33,790
So they're still in business. But now what can you do?

353
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:46,530
And to be like rely on local or state resources and the local and the the the treatment here.

354
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:52,109
This is the technology they are using is trying to get this stuff but it is not

355
00:43:52,110 --> 00:43:57,420
creating sufficient amount make you take the most extreme measures to do it.

356
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:06,730
I mean if you if you say if we do. So this lawsuit kisses all these in the course.

357
00:44:08,830 --> 00:44:16,600
And and there's the recent development is really now the phone already close to the drinking water, we think.

358
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:21,630
Here is Baron Cohen on this close to the Baron parcel.

359
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:28,080
Eventually, they were getting into the ground to the to the bottom part. So I just mentioned, you know, with drinking water.

360
00:44:28,590 --> 00:44:32,310
I'm not really particularly concerned about the drinking water because we have a treatment.

361
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:37,710
I mean, we use the same technology like the ozone. We use all of our houses to oxidize.

362
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:43,050
And the concentration will be very low with the surface water. And that's a human person would be able to take.

363
00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:53,790
Okay. But be able to take care of it. The problem here is the problem here is really this was this Lebowitz?

364
00:44:55,210 --> 00:44:59,680
Some of them are more on the water. Okay.

365
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:03,879
They are not on the city water, so they are rely on the ground water.

366
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:09,100
So you can see here with it diffuse into this area and they will be.

367
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:18,280
Okay. That could be the issue for them. Of each of them.

368
00:45:19,330 --> 00:45:29,510
So after this occurs. Now, the the the the cases require all of them to be collected in the door.

369
00:45:29,590 --> 00:45:36,130
If they are found they are impacted by the ground, then they have to be one to the to a city one.

370
00:45:36,430 --> 00:45:40,059
So, for example, this this area, they already are monitored.

371
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:42,770
They find the whales that dig the whale. The fund is gone them.

372
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:49,780
And then the city or the township has the pure the water rights for them to get connected of people.

373
00:45:50,710 --> 00:45:57,100
Okay. But some of these areas might cruise by these areas and like these areas here, for example.

374
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:06,060
I mean, the reason we don't if you want to predict a civil war in Syria will not provide the funding for that.

375
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:10,560
You have to pay for $2,000 or $2,000 to be.

376
00:46:12,190 --> 00:46:18,800
You draw the lines like the service lines to your house, to the house.

377
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:23,269
So here this kind of make a with bathroom with a model.

378
00:46:23,270 --> 00:46:30,180
But this is not really I mean, you can get a pretty good information about the the diffused of the houses with one,

379
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:38,840
but it can not really get all the way. So so that's also one of the reason here the this value I mean, some of these house value,

380
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:43,670
they are concerned because potentially this is under the contamination site.

381
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:52,340
So the situation is that the community sued the company and the city stability and

382
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:57,500
this decrease that you try to look together come on with a solution to do this,

383
00:46:57,710 --> 00:47:09,740
going to do this. So but the try to there's a still controversial controversy right now is whether we should be

384
00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:18,320
in favor of the federal government if this debris that we find is they as a Superfund site.

385
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:22,740
Okay. And then we come. Come, come here. To help to treat them.

386
00:47:23,930 --> 00:47:30,220
Okay. And it's not urgent because he's an EPA.

387
00:47:32,130 --> 00:47:40,950
Okay. Because look what I yes, it's very important for us, but for the EPA is to make these sites multiple sites.

388
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:48,820
You have to fight. For the EPA to help you clean up this.

389
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:53,900
Okay. You have to fight because you pay.

390
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:58,340
I mean, they have used your resources to do this work. I mean, trillion dollars.

391
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:01,580
I mean, to do this work. So this. Yeah, I'll fight for it.

392
00:48:01,850 --> 00:48:11,180
But then the community, some of the communities are still are very resistance, very resistant to the EPA designation of the Superfund site.

393
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:16,730
Because of pro-Tibetan. That's one of the beauties very properly about it.

394
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:21,490
If you declare as a Superfund site, you'll probably want jobs.

395
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:32,950
So the commission has big concerns. Even if you live on the site, which has the EPA offered help in an average, they could help pick anybody out.

396
00:48:33,190 --> 00:48:39,880
But you don't get a positive result. Yeah, because if you come or just come here to contribute to your site.

397
00:48:40,270 --> 00:48:46,330
Right. The EPA has to work together with you, with the ways that we justice to clean up the site.

398
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:52,990
Then they have a bid mechanism. For example, they can probably the thought you might like to talk about emergency response.

399
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:56,390
FEMA will not just come here to give you the money to ever use.

400
00:48:56,420 --> 00:49:02,440
You have this disaster here. You can see how to designate other emergency sites.

401
00:49:02,770 --> 00:49:06,490
This has to be delivered as a Superfund site visitor to the.

402
00:49:09,110 --> 00:49:12,290
Okay. So what can we do? I mean, now.

403
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:17,150
Now this is already contaminated already here. So basically, I mean,

404
00:49:17,390 --> 00:49:28,250
what they need to do is to say if the incident area's especially affected nearby the property of this area and all these households of the Civil War.

405
00:49:30,530 --> 00:49:35,350
Okay. But if you cannot, you can choose us that way.

406
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:46,339
And if we get kisses. And then through the wall yourself. Obviously we know that's very high in the radical future carcinogens.

407
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:50,670
If we think that if not treated then it would be. Okay.

408
00:49:50,910 --> 00:49:58,170
So if I give I mean was I look for the house has to be cut every time to get the other woman to come back.

409
00:49:59,110 --> 00:50:05,010
It's on top of this contemporary site. I decided I decided not to buy it.

410
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:11,220
So. So that's one of the reason. I mean, really have impact for reading for that purpose.

411
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:18,110
Hey. How are you? Good. Okay. What's up? Very, very heavy traffic.

412
00:50:18,410 --> 00:50:23,230
All right. Where do you drive from? By the Joe from Jersey.

413
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:27,340
Okay. It was bad traffic today. Okay.

414
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:31,460
Yeah. Well, it was close range, so.

415
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:41,660
So that's the the the the I mean, when the groundwater contaminated get it, contaminated is very difficult to them.

416
00:50:41,690 --> 00:50:47,330
And so complicated issue. And we don't have this like clear guidance or laws.

417
00:50:48,470 --> 00:50:51,230
2 to 2 Cavaliers. Okay.

418
00:50:52,160 --> 00:51:02,410
So this battle was difficult, but you can see the side from 1980s, the stops, the closures from 1960 and then now the phone is than it is now.

419
00:51:02,410 --> 00:51:06,200
Well, 40 years after, we are still debate about this stuff.

420
00:51:08,330 --> 00:51:11,720
Is any testing still being done? Yeah, the continuous testing.

421
00:51:11,930 --> 00:51:15,230
That's that's I mean, in terms of testing here, for example,

422
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:23,900
the wells that feed the wells to try to control that, they'll look to see how far that diffuse in the water.

423
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:29,840
Right. So these are kind of red lines. Which goal is make sure that they will not pass through that.

424
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:39,200
So what we can do is that we treat the water so that we can contain them both before they can reach to the river.

425
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:44,750
That's that's the plan. I mean, that's a big plan for that.

426
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:53,690
But we know that that's not really the case now. And the effect across the river and now is already certain of the the the the bottom part.

427
00:51:55,780 --> 00:52:06,150
Get to the bottom. So I mean, that's a big issue locally, the big issue.

428
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:13,480
But to me it's not really urgent for them because they have so many sites to take care.

429
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:18,880
And this is just a typical example here like we have.

430
00:52:25,570 --> 00:52:29,770
So. So, yes, we do have these programs to protect the groundwater.

431
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:33,250
But again, and it's perilous.

432
00:52:34,390 --> 00:52:38,980
And when that happens, it happens very often, very frequent, where it happens.

433
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:45,190
And it's very costly, very costly. So the best way to do it is prevention.

434
00:52:45,670 --> 00:52:49,870
So that's one of the reason I'm not really in favor of fracking.

435
00:52:50,140 --> 00:53:02,500
In fact, I'm not really a fan of fracking. But this is the there's a there's always a debate about, you know, the how can we get the gas?

436
00:53:03,670 --> 00:53:05,440
But there's some other ways I can think of.

437
00:53:05,710 --> 00:53:12,490
But is it because the groundwater now is easy, convenient to get it by when the water will get contaminated so you can't get it back?

438
00:53:12,490 --> 00:53:16,620
You just almost impossible. Okay.

439
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:23,750
Obviously for that. Okay.

440
00:53:23,790 --> 00:53:24,260
Questions?
