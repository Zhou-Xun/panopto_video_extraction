1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:07,830
OK, so we've talked a bit about food security, I think, at this point.

2
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,610
Hopefully we're comfortable with, you know, all those different ideas.

3
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:15,480
And then we talked a bit about, you know, what's going on in my neck of the woods,

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:24,330
the work that I've been doing to attempt to address these issues at scale along with, of course, a pretty special team that helps this happen.

5
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:28,410
And now we are going to discuss developing strategies.

6
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:32,800
OK. So I think that this is applicable for all of the work

7
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:39,790
that you will do in the public health space, in the health and well-being space and the social determinants of health.

8
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:40,870
However you define it

9
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:48,100
I think that this will be helpful, but I thought it would be useful to think about it in the context of food security, especially.

10
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:52,260
Right. I think we always. We always hear about the issues

11
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:57,510
We don't always hear about how to address it. Right. So this is a part of the puzzle.

12
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:05,760
OK so the very first step for addressing any issue that you run into is,

13
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:12,660
Understand the problem space, right? What's going on in the world?

14
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:20,220
What does the issue look like? How many people are affected? What does the evidence base say about what the problems are?

15
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:25,960
So we have to develop a very robust and strong understanding of what the issues are.

16
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:34,840
OK, so as you're doing that, consider everything from individuals all the way up through policies, thinking about that social ecological model.

17
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:40,890
Right. What are the individuals, the communities or that person exceeds individuals, person to person,

18
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:47,960
communities, organizations, health system, systems in general, all the way up to policy.

19
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:56,610
Right. So thinking about that entire collection of folks that as you move higher up, the more people you are able to affect the work.

20
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:02,250
OK so, what are those problems look like in each one of those categories?

21
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:11,310
Is is a really critical piece of that work. So I've included a few links that are quite helpful for understanding the problem space.

22
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:16,700
OK. So Food Environment Atlas is a pretty special resource.

23
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:21,380
It's developed by the USDA and a number of other partners. We can open it up if we want.

24
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:25,340
But I would just encourage you all to take a look at it when you get a chance.

25
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:32,000
500 cities actually transition into something called the CDC Places Project.

26
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:41,000
So. What this does is it takes a look at, I think, about twenty seven different chronic disease issues,

27
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,840
whether they be health behaviors, whether they be health outcomes,

28
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:52,880
whether they be access to health care, that help us understand what the issues are in the context of a zip code,

29
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:56,990
in the context of a city, in the context of a census tract.

30
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:05,840
Right. So it's really digging deep into the data so that you can understand what those health outcomes are in a very local context.

31
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:13,580
OK. So if you wanted to take a look at, I don't know, 43604 or

32
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:16,850
I don't know each city of Detroit

33
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:24,430
you could find this sort of data that is connected to those health outcomes that we discussed way at the beginning when it comes to food security.

34
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:28,880
OK. So that's a really helpful thing. The next one that I'm going to point out is policy.

35
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:32,450
Policy map does what it says on the tin.

36
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:42,550
Right. It gives us a a perspective on what the space looks like in the world of policy across all sorts of indicators, including

37
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:50,530
things like food access. Right. Like how many grocery stores are there in this neighborhood in the zip code that we're looking at?

38
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:55,090
And how many of these areas would be considered a food desert based on that metric?

39
00:03:55,090 --> 00:04:03,400
How many of them lose money to other areas? Because people are leaving that neighborhood to go elsewhere for for food.

40
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:11,680
So it's like, how do you plug in that business case? How do you plug in changes to policy that can address issues at scale?

41
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,800
So policy map is very helpful. ALICE Index is another one,

42
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:22,520
it's through the United Way. ALICE means asset limited, income constrained and employed.

43
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:22,780
OK.

44
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:33,400
So it's a really useful way to understand what working class food and security looks like in the context of America in the present day.

45
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:41,950
OK. So they develop this index not based on the poverty guidelines, which are archaic and kind of imaginary.

46
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:50,040
Right. They base it on what are the most common costs in a household in present day America,

47
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:55,060
health care, child care, access to food, transportation, jobs, things of that nature.

48
00:04:55,060 --> 00:05:04,270
Right. So they take those numbers and they develop an average for every single census tract that they do this index in,

49
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:10,840
And then they compare it to what the household income is in that neighborhood and how much

50
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:16,670
a person would need to make in order to truly have access to all of those needed things.

51
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:26,230
OK. So hopefully that makes sense. The benefit of that is it helps us understand how people can

52
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:36,520
Have a job, right? They can be employed, have a decent income, theoretically be above the poverty line as defined by the federal poverty guidelines,

53
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:42,880
which tells us how to actually get access to a number of food programs, including SNAP.

54
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:51,390
And and it tells us where those gaps are. Right. So that question that I asked, how does this happen?

55
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:57,030
Why is there still food insecurity can also come back to the way that we define something like poverty.

56
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:03,150
Right. So ALICE Index is very helpful for helping to make that case and also understanding

57
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:07,530
local context when it comes to the challenges that people are facing.

58
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:11,930
And the last thing, just the census is always helpful.

59
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:16,410
Right. So if you want to know household size, you want to know median income.

60
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:21,540
You want to know, I don't know, breakdown of age ranges.

61
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:25,530
You want to know the number of people and the types of jobs they have.

62
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:29,640
The census is the place to go to get some of that data. OK.

63
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:33,780
The smaller the unit of measure, the more that there is variability.

64
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:42,000
So always keep that in mind. But otherwise, these are all very helpful resources for understanding the problems space.

65
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,800
OK. So all of these things that I just shared are quantitative in nature.

66
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,390
They are about the numbers.

67
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:58,330
The numbers are very, very important to make the case, to understand context, to make best guesses that are based on evidence on where to intervene.

68
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:05,790
OK. They all make sense they're all important. Qualitative is critical to actually addressing these issues.

69
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:13,080
OK. You have to be able to connect and build connections on the ground and either learn from previous work

70
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:18,990
that has occurred or do the work yourself to understand what this really means in a local context.

71
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:25,650
OK, qualitative is very, very important. And also lived experience is expertize.

72
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:30,960
OK, having to navigate this world, understanding the barriers that exist.

73
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:36,840
As you multiply that out, as you start to connect with a broader community, you're more able to address these issues.

74
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:43,620
OK so. Get those numbers, understand that context, but also talk to people, connect with people,

75
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:49,730
build with people. OK, so you've worked through the problem space, right?

76
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:57,560
You understand what the issues are. You started talking to people. One of the first things that starts to happen when you talk to people as opposed

77
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:02,780
to just looking at the numbers is you understand what has happened before.

78
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:10,640
Right. You're not just dropping into a community that has never had any sort of intervention or strategy ever.

79
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:17,390
There have always been attempts at addressing food insecurity. It's taken on a number of forms.

80
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:21,980
There are a number of people that are just as passionate about this subject as you are.

81
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:26,660
Right. So what is the existing solution space look like?

82
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:31,100
Develop that local context, consider the business case,

83
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:37,610
understand what evidence based approaches exist to address that specific issue or that

84
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:41,990
overall strategy that you're hoping to to address that you're hoping to intervene.

85
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:49,040
Right. So, figuring out how to address senior food insecurity is going to look different

86
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:55,940
than how to address it for children that are out of school due to Covid.

87
00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:05,780
As opposed to people that are living in shelters or people that are, you know, consistently unhoused.

88
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:10,820
Right. Like, these are all different populations that all actually exist in uptown,

89
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:17,250
the neighborhood I work in. They're all sizable populations. And we have to just understand that local context.

90
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:20,780
And we also have to understand what interventions are already in place.

91
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:27,100
OK. And the other thing is, you know. Projects sometimes fail.

92
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:33,130
Sometimes they succeed. A lot of it is based on the quality of the intervention,

93
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:41,140
but sometimes it just happens, right? And the only way you're really going to get that context is by talking to people,

94
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:49,690
building trust and listening, listening, listening and having some humility when you enter into spaces.

95
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:55,490
People have had so many interventions that have occurred that have come and gone, and

96
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:58,330
You know, sometimes they're burned out, sometimes they're tired,

97
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:05,470
and sometimes they provide real insight into how you address the issue, whether the project was successful or not.

98
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:14,620
There's always learning to be had. OK. So once we've looked at the problem space and the solution space, you start to fill in those gaps.

99
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:18,850
Right. What are the gaps that still remain? How do you address those?

100
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:26,600
So as you are figuring out those gaps and the work that you've done to understand both the problems and the solutions,

101
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:32,260
that's likely given you a wealth of ideas for promising practices,

102
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:37,170
for evidence based practices, for just about anything,

103
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:43,660
you're going to start to think about what those gaps are and where those gaps can potentially be filled.

104
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:47,440
OK. I like to think of it like soil,

105
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,540
I told you that urban guy right.

106
00:10:49,540 --> 00:11:00,340
So the soil is at its most nutrient dense and rich and best for the well-being of your plants and eventually for your tomatoes,

107
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:13,240
your peppers, your melons, whatever those things are, when they have the right combination of clay, of silt, of like nice soil, of nutrients.

108
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:17,620
Right. And lack of, you know, like dangerous heavy metals.

109
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:22,960
Right. So there's so many things that go into creating healthy soil.

110
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:28,840
I like to think of addressing an issue or developing a strategy in the same way.

111
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:34,600
A comprehensive strategy is a thing that is diverse and rich and has pieces of this and pieces

112
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:40,870
of that and allows for this sort of fluidity right here and this part that's really solid.

113
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:45,760
Right. So just thinking about interventions that sort of way can be helpful as well.

114
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,190
And just thinking about what those gaps are.

115
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:57,970
Maybe you need a little bit more phosphorus or the equivalent of phosphorus in food security in Ann Arbor.

116
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:05,080
Right. You know so it's like just thinking about things in that way. And also, like of course, sustainability is funding.

117
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:10,150
It's capacity building. It's accepting that all learning is iterative in nature.

118
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:16,270
It's developing those relationships that give me real insight. It's thinking strategically.

119
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:21,610
It's doing right. It's evidence based and it's always doing with

120
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:25,890
Instead of to or for. Do it with.

121
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:30,950
Do it alongside. That was very serious of me.

122
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,640
Sorry. All right.

123
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:42,520
So last step when it comes to developing a strategy is we take all of this learning that we've been doing, all of this learning that we've been doing.

124
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:49,370
And for me, this works quite well when it comes to developing a strategy.

125
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:54,550
It, It helps me understand the problem space very well.

126
00:12:54,550 --> 00:13:01,680
It helps me understand the solution space very well, and it helps to develop comprehensive strategies or strategies that

127
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:07,290
feel robust. OK. My team did this for,

128
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:15,420
We did this for COVID-19 on March 6th before the emergency announcement on March 14.

129
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:21,090
And we were ahead of the game in this neighborhood and knocking stuff out just like that, OK?

130
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:25,140
It was a fluid space. It's still a fluid space where lots of things have changed.

131
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:31,200
But that strategy that we developed, guided us, it really did.

132
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:36,240
And, you know, you can change this this table up and make it a neighborhood level.

133
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:42,600
Right. So individual person to person. Communal, organizational and systems.

134
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:53,160
Right. And then neighborhood, right. So it's just it's adapting this to fit your needs and thinking through what a strategy looks like.

135
00:13:53,160 --> 00:14:01,050
And, you know, I know that you all aren't going to be able to, you know, just pop out a strategy and develop it right now that prevents food security,

136
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:04,710
that screens where food insecurity and treats food and security,

137
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:15,300
that manages the chronic issues that come with long term food very low food insecurity vs. moderately food secure.

138
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:20,730
You know, so I'm not expecting you all to develop a strategy right this moment.

139
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:31,110
But I do think this is a very helpful exercise just to think through what it looks like, what it feels like to develop a strategy in a local context.

140
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:34,950
OK. So this is really my last slide.

141
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:49,520
My last thought. Consider this process adapted to fit your needs and work to develop strategies that address issues at scale.

142
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:55,550
I know you're all passionate. I know you all are going to figure this out and you're going to figure out the path that works for you.

143
00:14:55,550 --> 00:15:04,930
And it's possible that this is a method that will be helpful for you when it's time for you to address the issue.

144
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:10,670
So I'll open it up for questions. Imaginary questions flowing in.

145
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:16,870
And, you know, if they come to me, then I'll respond when I get a chance to.

146
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:22,460
And we'll go from there, so that's pretty much it.

147
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:27,500
I really appreciate the time. I'm excited to see, you know, I always I love FPHLP.

148
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:36,110
I love the work that that this team has been doing for years, and I think that you all are truly the next leaders.

149
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:40,430
And I'm excited to see you all grow. And hopefully this was helpful for you all.

150
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:45,110
If you ever want to get in touch with me, you know, talk to Hannah. Talk to Dana.

151
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:48,770
And we can connect. All right. Thank you.

152
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:50,560
Have a nice day.
