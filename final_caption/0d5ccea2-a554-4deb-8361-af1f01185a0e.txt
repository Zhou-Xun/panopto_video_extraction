1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:07,440
I pressed record. I will make this plug. I do think we'll end class a little bit early today, but, you know,

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:15,389
probably all the better for you because right now there's this faculty, staff, post-doc town hall.

3
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:23,820
It's happening virtually, I guess it's but right afterwards, across the street in the Cornell Community Room,

4
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,240
there will be ice cream for all, including nondairy options.

5
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,750
So if you don't have class after this, just go across the street to the community room.

6
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:38,050
And though the ice cream. Okay. So continuing with total worker health.

7
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:41,399
So we left off right before we started talking about the.

8
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:52,500
NASH Well, the. Q So this is a questionnaire that Nash themselves have made specifically for the purpose of assessing total worker health,

9
00:00:52,830 --> 00:01:03,480
and it was only just released last year. So it explores five domains workplace evaluation experience, workplace policies and culture,

10
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:09,210
the physical environment, safety, climate, health status, home community and society.

11
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,650
And it is available in both English and Spanish currently.

12
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:20,540
So we'll watch a video from the person who helped develop the well B Q Top.

13
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:25,880
And I don't know if these marks are commercials, but I hope not now.

14
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:30,060
I just like bookmarks. Bookmarks, yes, it's one.

15
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:41,430
The goal is our aim of sport is by all sides and all types of employers,

16
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:51,030
because we think the issues that workers face are going to be true for all different industries, organizations and sizes of organizations.

17
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:56,760
The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has developed a new tool for assessing worker wellbeing.

18
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:04,110
An unusual new tool, which was designed to be used by any organization to assess the wellbeing of the workplace.

19
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:12,060
Competition was part of the team that developed this new tool, that worker wellbeing questionnaire for you.

20
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:16,829
It provides a comprehensive and holistic assessment of worker.

21
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:24,510
Well, it provides its greatest measure for well-being across multiple spheres now as well.

22
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:33,950
It is intended to be used for workers of all industries and occupations and suitable for all types of work arrangements.

23
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:38,070
Full time, part time convention center work arrangements.

24
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,910
The National McHugh is based on the worker wellbeing framework.

25
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,020
Each domain is a critical aspect of safe and healthy employment.

26
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:50,070
There are two main social worker wellbeing.

27
00:02:50,670 --> 00:03:02,220
One is workplace political environment climate that refers to the control features and also working conditions such as climate.

28
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:14,950
The second domain of workers well-being is marked by immigration and experience and includes the psychological impact of social work context.

29
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:28,630
The third domain I work well in is workplace policy, a culture that captures aspects of people's lives relating to organizational policies,

30
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:37,540
of having a word wellbeing that covers all the usual things people think about.

31
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:45,550
Overall stress. Overall mental health. Physical health surrounds everything I've just talked about.

32
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:51,520
This is the home community music artists, the way I learn, algorithms, all the things I find to work.

33
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:56,680
We know that people don't live and work to actually have your whole life.

34
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:03,810
Life Worker and wellbeing questionnaire provides metrics for many different topics.

35
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:09,280
All the things that you would need to know for ongoing health workers are doing.

36
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:15,410
You can use it to set benchmarks, internal organization or workforce.

37
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:19,000
You could use it to examine changes over time.

38
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:29,200
The impact of changes to your policies or programs or involve interventions, and you can use it to compare results across different means.

39
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:39,070
Some of these, of course, you need to control for demographics and control for differences in health, occupations and job categories.

40
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:47,410
You can control for those things and you care of the wellbeing of workers within the organization.

41
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:56,920
Over time that will be key work like this. First, management must include workers in decision making about NASH or acute and community,

42
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:01,570
using the results to make necessary changes to policies, programs and or practices.

43
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:09,890
Second, communicate to employees the purpose of the survey, the intended outcomes and the privacy protections that are in place.

44
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:19,720
Third, administer the survey. Fourth, analyze and share the results.

45
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:27,110
Fifth, take action on results. Six.

46
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,010
We administer the survey at a later time. I look for changes from the actions taken.

47
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:40,440
It is up to you to decide how often the Minister will you find out if you've made

48
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:46,530
any changes to the workplace and how long those changes would need to take affects?

49
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:52,920
You know you are making a change, but if you make a difference, really, even if I might stress more often.

50
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:59,370
But we do think it could take a while for some people and programs to really make a difference.

51
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,790
And in order to increase participation in the national T, you communicate with your employees.

52
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:13,650
The purpose and uses of the survey, for example, with the shared confidentiality workers will be more inclined to give honest answers.

53
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:24,370
First of all, there must be informed consent, and workers must be aware of why the survey scheme and be effective and try to

54
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:30,570
make sure that they know when the individual responses and not for workers.

55
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:37,080
And your plan for keeping the data private and confidential should be communicated to workers.

56
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:42,660
And also, why should organizations care about the wellbeing of workers?

57
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:51,120
Well, because there has been data showing that in fact things such as engagement that work productivity, turnover,

58
00:06:51,120 --> 00:07:02,760
intention, job satisfaction, customer satisfaction and client satisfaction, even health care costs, particularly personnel.

59
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:07,740
If you work hard, you know, you save a very short sap.

60
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:18,000
We are having trouble finding people to hire. So competitive employer service right now when you have policies and programs to offer that support.

61
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:27,510
First of all, the we believe that working here is a useful tool that employers could use to understand

62
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:32,250
how workers are feeling about different aspects of our policies and culture,

63
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:42,210
and identify opportunities for strengthening worker safety, health and wellbeing, which will of course, impact organizational outcomes.

64
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:49,820
So. That's the more public facing video.

65
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,350
They did an hour and a half long webinar on how to use it.

66
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:59,600
But I want, you know, for you to watch that it's on YouTube unless you really want to do it.

67
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,760
By the way, did you see my announcement showing that previous examples?

68
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:07,940
Was that helpful? Yeah. Okay. Okay. I'll check that out.

69
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,680
I also post the papers, Josh, that she asked why I just picked three.

70
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:22,550
That seems interesting. Okay. So let's actually take a look at the barbecue now to look at what is actually inside.

71
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:33,180
This is almost a 90 page document, but a lot of it is is like a lot of boilerplate, blah, blah, blah.

72
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:41,750
Disclaimer You'll notice that in her video, even when describing the barbecue,

73
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:49,100
she kind of uses vague language that's purpose for having worked with people at Nice.

74
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:56,360
Now you don't want to get too specific, kind of dig yourself into a hole and make statements.

75
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:06,350
So you want to keep it broad in that regard. But it is, according to the researchers, like applicable to different occupations.

76
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:11,310
So there's table contents, blah, blah, acknowledgments, etc., etc.

77
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:14,710
Colorado State. Yeah, question about the vagueness.

78
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:20,480
Is that more so to make it easier for places to adopt without having like a single thing do it?

79
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:24,290
Or is it more like a government and political thing to be vague?

80
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:34,970
Both. Yeah. So like, for example, recently I wrote a nice social science blog on respiratory protection for voluntary use among construction workers,

81
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:40,300
and it underwent cross clearance for five months, at least 20 drafts.

82
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:45,080
I kid you not just on the nuance of like language to be used,

83
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:51,410
because once it's put out and it's officially like organizer, CDC or whatever, it's there forever.

84
00:09:51,800 --> 00:10:01,190
I mean, people can issue corrections and statements. That's not ideal, but you want it to be not time bound in particular.

85
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,959
So you don't want to say things like specific to COVID 19 pandemic or anything like that.

86
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:10,430
Right. But you also don't want to say like it works better for people who work in manufacturing.

87
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:16,580
So those are kind of, you know, the things I thought her.

88
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:23,630
It's always interesting to see how people decorate her other offices, but maybe they just put her in like a random empty office for the elderly.

89
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:28,090
That to, I think, nothing in the background there. Some people's offices are really like that, though.

90
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:33,280
Yeah. So how was this developed? They developed this with Rand Corporation.

91
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:36,700
How many of you are familiar with Rand Corporation? A You are?

92
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:41,810
Josh Yeah, so it's not like I think there's RAND Corporation in video games too.

93
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:46,640
They do a lot of that. Yeah, yeah. I'm most aware of them as a consultant.

94
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:53,480
They are a consulting firm, but they are one of the largest research consulting firms, private.

95
00:10:53,780 --> 00:11:01,230
So they do outside of academia. They are one of the corporations that do a ton of research.

96
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:06,650
So if you like research but you don't necessarily want to work in industry per se,

97
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:11,930
but you don't want to work in academia and you don't want to work in government. A lot of people go work at RAND Corporation.

98
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:19,069
So they were hired essentially as contractors to help design the questionnaire based on the conceptual framework

99
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:26,090
that you saw with the five domains and they use the framework was derived from in-depth literature reviews,

100
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:30,920
looking at wellbeing theories, research, measurement, tools, all that.

101
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:35,510
So they field tested the questionnaire in 2018.

102
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:41,810
The draft questionnaire was was piloted essentially on a probability based sample.

103
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:54,200
And then participants took about 20 minutes. They pilot tested it with 975 people, and from that they created multi questions, scales,

104
00:11:54,500 --> 00:12:00,500
conducted factor analysis like we previously talked about and other psychometric testing,

105
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:05,660
conducted tests of concurrent validity and eliminated less productive items.

106
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:11,570
So essentially they did what you're going to do for this class, but on like a really, really large scale.

107
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:16,700
So now this final questionnaire can be completed in approximately 15 minutes.

108
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:27,170
So they measure all of these constructs. So for worker evaluation and experience, they have all of these constructs measured in 16 questions,

109
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:36,709
workplace policies and culture, all of these constructs measured in 14 questions, workplace environment and safety, climate.

110
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:46,070
All of these constructs measured in ten items, health status, all of these in 23 items, and then human society five items.

111
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:55,480
And then they are. Also have optional items that you can add if you want more on employment circumstances and then demographic information.

112
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:59,380
Now, for the purposes of employers administering this survey,

113
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:07,270
they're not really going to go beyond descriptive right percentages and counts and kind of like the bar chart that she showed.

114
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:12,100
But for researchers or like anyone like us, you might want to implement the survey.

115
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:16,450
We're going to want to collect the demographic information as control variables.

116
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:20,140
Right. Because we're going to be doing some more sophisticated analysis.

117
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:23,979
So this is meant.

118
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:32,950
So they also generally with these things, they provide you coding instructions as well, like a code book on how to analyze and interpret the data.

119
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:44,740
So for example, you can see here this construct is job satisfaction and in the code book it's the variable is called job SAT.

120
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,830
Overall, I am blank with my job.

121
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:58,060
Not at all satisfied is equal to a one not to satisfied is equal to a to somewhat satisfied is equal to a three very satisfied is equal

122
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:08,320
to a four does not apply is a -99 and then they tell you like which where these questions came from and where it's adapted from.

123
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,350
But of course, you know, that's just a recommendations.

124
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:20,230
Some people really get into the coding and you can choose to recode or reverse code however you want, depending on your analysis.

125
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:25,000
But they show you again how to essentially use the questionnaire.

126
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:31,630
And for you, I mean, for people, for employers, they can administer this over paper.

127
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:41,680
But it's also totally feasible for you to just basically duplicate this whole thing into Qualtrics and save yourself a lot of time.

128
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,920
And you don't necessarily have to use the whole thing either.

129
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:53,320
So if you're only interested in like one domain, for example, you can just ask questions about the one domain.

130
00:14:53,740 --> 00:15:04,540
So, you know, this is the actual questionnaire starting on page 42, but, you know, just say, you know, let me scroll all the way back up.

131
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:13,550
If, you know, just say, for example, Josh, you were interested in workplace discrimination,

132
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:20,840
you would take these three questions together because they are the three questions for the construct of discrimination.

133
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:29,900
So you would use, I feel discriminated against in my job because of my age, because of my race or ethnic origin and because of my gender.

134
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:41,030
Right. Or you can see that sexual harassment is just a single standalone item because it's a binary yes or no for certain other things,

135
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:50,120
like work schedule, work flexibility. You all use these two items so they specify their this is all like the behind the scenes kind of stuff.

136
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:57,110
And then for the mock okay. And then for what's actually does that even work?

137
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:03,150
Okay. I wrote that this keyboard. What happened?

138
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:13,330
I don't know that that's keyboard works, but this is the actual questionnaire that the the workers themselves would receive.

139
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:19,270
As you can see, it's very lengthy. And then here are the optional items.

140
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:24,820
And then this one. Here is the source table.

141
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:28,900
So just say like you go through the web queue for your assignment.

142
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:34,959
Part of it is to cite where the sources came from for the specific scale.

143
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:40,450
So you could always reference back this table to see like where the specific constructs came from.

144
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:45,700
Even with your race and ethnicity and like demographic questions,

145
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:54,120
I expect there to be some justification about why you chose to include them, like race, gender, ethnicity.

146
00:16:54,130 --> 00:17:02,950
Those are all like pretty standard. But for some reason if you are asking them about their sexual orientation or

147
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:08,080
you're collecting income or you want to know the number of kids that they have,

148
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:14,470
there has to be a reason why you're choosing to include that in relation to your survey, and that should be explained.

149
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:19,120
Okay. All right. What do you all think of the.

150
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,810
Well, B q. It's pretty nifty.

151
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,940
Nifty. Okay.

152
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:33,889
Seems like a good tool to use, but I immediately just think of like, what if all employee employees just say, hate your job, don't like working there?

153
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:37,850
And the company is just like, we didn't get what we wanted.

154
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:42,290
Let's just keep going for what we're doing. Yeah, they like that. They're like acquiescence.

155
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:51,200
Or, like, sad. Sad, sad, sad, sad.

156
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:59,149
Sad, sad is facing. There it is. Sorry what we talked about earlier this semester as acquiescence is either just putting

157
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:02,670
neutral on everything and then Satisficing is just put like agree on everything.

158
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:13,520
But I think for an organization that would care enough to administer the well, BQ, the workers probably aren't predominantly curmudgeonly.

159
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:18,260
I think the fact they're able to cram all that a 15 minute questionnaire is pretty good.

160
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:21,630
I mean, there's a lot of other things we're looking at there.

161
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:25,760
Yeah, it is a lot. It's not too sensitive, though.

162
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:30,379
So if you look at the nature of the questions, though, they do ask people to recall things,

163
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:35,000
but it's not like too sensitive, like a sexual history questionnaire or something like that.

164
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:43,459
Yeah. So that took years and years to make years and years and years and years.

165
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:53,150
And now they're trying to get people to implement it further because Harvard had their own total worker health questionnaire,

166
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:59,300
which I was planning to use for one of my grants, and it's called the Harvard Wish Tool, if you'll look it up.

167
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:10,730
But that total worker health wish tool from Harvard is really meant to be answered by organizational leaders or people in charge,

168
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,680
not the average worker.

169
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:23,750
So you can't really give that to a worker and expect them to be able to answer all a lot of these questions about policy implementation.

170
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:30,500
So this is definitely thinking about the downstream user. Okay.

171
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:35,060
So now we're going to go into case studies that use total worker health.

172
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:44,750
So, you know, some really straightforward examples of integration of total worker health are like

173
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:49,910
regular joint meetings between the Safety Committee and the Health Promotion Committee.

174
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:59,780
A lot of workplaces now kind of fuze them together like a respiratory protection program that addresses tobacco use.

175
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:07,610
So like, we're all wearing you, we're all wearing masks, but we're not part of a respiratory protection program.

176
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:14,899
A respiratory protection program is like if you work at a health care facility or a workplace that requires you to

177
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:22,280
have respiratory protection that is done through fit testing to a specific model like a 95 or something like that.

178
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:30,590
Often times, if you are a tobacco user, when you are fit tested for your respirator,

179
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:36,980
the results are less accurate because they do something called what they call a qualitative fit test.

180
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:43,849
So they'll, like, put a giant bonnet over your head, not like a southern southern bell bought it,

181
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:47,930
but like a like a clear board, like a clear plastic bonnet.

182
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:51,739
And then they'll spray a couple of chemicals in.

183
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:55,910
One is like a banana smell. One is like a sweet taste.

184
00:20:56,210 --> 00:21:02,750
One is a bitter taste and one is simulated smoke, which I've done that before and like coughed immediately.

185
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:11,240
But if you're a tobacco user, your ability to taste and smell and detect those chemicals is a lot lower.

186
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:18,110
So they think you're not you have to be fitted for a higher level respirator,

187
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:23,810
but that's just because you've damaged your olfactory and taste buds, essentially.

188
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:29,480
So, you know, an wanted to be more effective, they would address something like tobacco use,

189
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:36,500
ergonomic consultations and interventions that include joint health and arthritis stress management,

190
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:43,940
leading to worker resiliency, integrated programs for both work and community, for example, fall prevention.

191
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:47,330
So now we have multigenerational communities.

192
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,379
If you ever come visit me on the sixth floor where my office is,

193
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:57,950
I have like an article posted on on my bulletin board outside that I ripped out of our trade magazine,

194
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:03,260
talking about how, like, millennial leaders are the next generation of leaders.

195
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:12,200
But now we have four generations in the workplace baby boomers, X, Millennial and Gen Z and so forth.

196
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:19,360
Prevention very much is a real thing because for the older adults they not only have to worry about that in the workplace, but at the home as well.

197
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:25,790
So if you're able to implement that in both places, those are straightforward examples of total worker health integration,

198
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,620
comprehensive screenings for things like diabetes or cardiovascular health,

199
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:38,810
occupational health clinics, EPA employee assistance programs, nutrition counseling, all that.

200
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:46,880
We'll talk more about EPA's and then occupational health and workplace delivered in the patient centered medical home model.

201
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:58,490
How many of you are familiar with a patient centered medical model that, like family members are trained to administer medical like procedures?

202
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:04,400
No medical bonus like your doctor's office, right?

203
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:08,590
Yes. System that you're in. I don't know.

204
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:11,680
That's all. That's all you know. Okay, that's a good start.

205
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:19,900
So a Patient-Centered medical home is a new health care approach in primary prevention.

206
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:23,890
This is like a large chunk of what my master's concentration was about.

207
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:34,030
So rather than receiving care from a primary provider or a primary care provider, you have a whole team that is your primary care provider.

208
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:38,979
So you not only have your point of contact physician, you have your team nurse,

209
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:48,850
you have your team nutritionist or like dietetics counselor, someone who does p t, r, o t and then mental health as well.

210
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:54,940
So at any given time, like just see Team Orange is responsible for care for Bridget.

211
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:58,989
Everybody knows what's going on with Bridget and everybody knows what the other

212
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:03,930
members of the team are asking Bridget to do or what her needs are just used for,

213
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:08,799
like nursing homes. Because I'm just trying to think of the cost of being.

214
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:15,130
I mean, the normal people have this or are like, no, I know what a 40 year old have a medical team or that, oh,

215
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:26,109
it's frequently used in federally qualified health centers or medical centers with a large Medicare Medicaid reimbursement.

216
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:35,830
Or like in the clinic that I did my internship, what which was a flagship clinic to resettle refugees like additional funds from the state.

217
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:42,550
I was just trying to think of like the I mean, the average person doesn't also have a dietician and no,

218
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:50,799
no, say the acute C that I was I actually had almost that like the dietitians were AmeriCorps members.

219
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:56,620
We were actually dietitians. But they have like mental health, like multiple doctors with different specialties,

220
00:24:56,620 --> 00:25:03,190
like pediatric pediatricians up to like it was a geriatrics focused doctor.

221
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:08,860
Yeah. Yeah. And some of these federally qualified health centers will have a dentist in-house as well,

222
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:13,440
outside of why our teeth and I's not considered health care.

223
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:18,549
Sorry, I didn't mean to give that, but like, you know, most people realistically don't have it.

224
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:24,490
So I have, I would say, really good health care, but I don't have a patient centered medical team.

225
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:28,000
I have a primary care provider, and then I have a bunch of specialists.

226
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:34,929
And then when they look up, they can see what the other people wrote about me, but they've never like met them.

227
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:43,390
They don't work in the same facility. There is no relationship, there's no rapport, there's no like group effort to address my health.

228
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:52,990
I would say this is a more common practice in like Western European countries and then some countries in like South America.

229
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:56,380
Mm hmm. But it's a nice it's a really nice model.

230
00:25:56,740 --> 00:26:01,479
I think it's a good work better than having, like, five different doctors who don't speak.

231
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:08,020
But obviously, I, I like Spectrum in Grand Rapids and it's like, yeah, I can get referred to like whatever specialist they need.

232
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:10,179
But every single time I go to different specialists,

233
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:15,850
I have to like relay my entire medical history and then, like, tell them what my problem is again.

234
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:22,640
Yeah. Patient-Centered medical home is nice. It is. It is for sure.

235
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:30,530
I will say, you know, being in academia, it's really hard to hurt my feelings because I've read like peer reviews,

236
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:34,189
I've read grant reviews, I've read student evaluations.

237
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:42,470
But if you want to hurt your own feelings, read what a doctor's summary notes are of you after your visit.

238
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:50,710
Oh, well, last time I was marked down for moderate drug use, they said I drink alcohol and I feel like that was there is a difference.

239
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:57,499
I have to get the truth from record because I'm like, let's give you a chance that it's always well,

240
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:04,700
they always have to write in a very specific way, like patient rather than like patient does not smell like patient, denies, whatever.

241
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:09,440
Yeah, it's like 43 bit like that. Yeah, well, I don't deny that.

242
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,710
I just said, like, I don't smoke. It seems different.

243
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:17,750
My doctor's thinking I was, like, shooting up or something. But they think you're lying.

244
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,230
That you're lying? Yeah. Everything. Yeah, well, I.

245
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:26,060
You know how it's innocent until proven guilty, I think in health care, it's.

246
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:36,320
Yeah, yes, yes, yes. So for this first case study for total worker help is is a very basic one.

247
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,770
It's called healthy parks, healthy communities, healthy nation.

248
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:47,060
So this is through the National Park Service. And I've had the pleasure of helping to develop some trainings for the NPS,

249
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:53,960
specifically around opioid waste and people just dumping random opioid waste in parks.

250
00:27:54,410 --> 00:28:01,500
But this this total worker health intervention, in particular, the National Public Service.

251
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:13,190
The National Park Service has over 400 park areas in the United States and over 22,000 permanent and seasonal employees, mostly seasonal employees.

252
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:22,190
But on the job injuries and fatalities is super common in the Park Service, as you can imagine.

253
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:25,700
And they also want to increase employee satisfaction.

254
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:29,120
It can be pretty lonely, but you definitely see some stuff.

255
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:32,239
And we've heard from NPS personnel,

256
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:41,240
like some people have really dangerous jobs where they have to essentially like do landscaping or maintain shrubbery off like cliffs

257
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:49,310
and stuff and people will just like fall down and die or like you might get bit by like a rattlesnake or something like that,

258
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:52,639
and there's no one around to help these kinds of things.

259
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:58,070
So essentially the goal of this total worker health intervention was to address the physical health component,

260
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:03,290
but also increase employee satisfaction. So there wasn't as much staff turnover.

261
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:12,320
So what they did was they used an E tool for self assessment looking at safety, health and wellness.

262
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:19,190
And so you can see they looked at leadership management and so the pillars were accountability,

263
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:26,540
sustained capacity communication, consistent service, wide management systems, etc.

264
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:34,370
So their goal essentially was to eventually broaden safety, to include psychological safety,

265
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:40,370
suicide prevention, respectful work environments, DNI and mental health.

266
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:44,510
But their total work health intervention thus far was just that.

267
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:48,410
The E tool self assessment. So very, very basic.

268
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:54,980
Okay, this one under the hat addressing mental health in the construction industry.

269
00:29:55,640 --> 00:30:05,240
So the construction industry does have some of the highest rates of suicide and that has continued to be true throughout the opioid epidemic.

270
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:10,459
And now the the sin DMX of COVID 19 and opioids.

271
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:15,590
And at least 57% have experienced a mental health issue during their career.

272
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:23,780
But this is likely to be a severe under-reporting just because and I'm working right now with the Nash construction sector,

273
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:33,620
just because of the culture of construction. There's a lot of toxic masculinity or like also like a machismo in some way where

274
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:38,990
they don't necessarily speak openly about mental health issues because of stigma.

275
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:43,730
They don't necessarily talk openly about addiction because of stigma.

276
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:47,990
It's very much like tough person mentality.

277
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:55,310
There are more women now who work in the construction and trades, but it is still very much predominantly male.

278
00:30:56,270 --> 00:31:04,940
So this total worker health intervention was Willis Towers Watson, which is one of the largest construction companies in the United States,

279
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:11,840
developed partnered with the Suicide Awareness Voices of Education r save to develop a state of the art,

280
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,680
mental health, education and suicide prevention training program.

281
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:24,470
So this was a multi level. Intervention that included online videos, live presentations and face to face trainings.

282
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:31,760
So the first level of the intervention was to just educate the entire Willers.

283
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:34,280
Willis watched two Towers Watson workforce,

284
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:42,620
including contractors to just number one promote awareness of mental health and recognizing self recognition of mental health issues.

285
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:50,180
Then Level two is talking to foremen and managers who we call frontline supervisors on

286
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:56,030
getting them to enhance their listening skills and how to direct those in need to resources.

287
00:31:56,040 --> 00:32:02,630
So rather than being punitive for substance use disorders or issues that might come up at work.

288
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:11,509
Recognizing that being able to talk to them and then directing them to the resources and then level three of this intervention was getting

289
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:22,100
owners and senior stakeholders essentially to ensure appropriate products services available to protect organization and employee health.

290
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:31,780
Okay. Again, notice how none of these have been evaluated yet.

291
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:35,909
I say. Uh huh. How effective are they? Yeah.

292
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:38,200
I guess we'll get to one where it's actually evaluated.

293
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:46,580
This one here is the Eriksen living extends care to wellness and integrates employee health and wellness.

294
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,030
That's kind of a long intervention name.

295
00:32:48,040 --> 00:33:00,220
But essentially this Ericsson living is a full spectrum retirement community, basically like nursing homes with 16 campuses in nine states.

296
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:07,750
So they have lot of special features for the residents like memory care and different types of housing and stuff.

297
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:11,170
But what about for the 12,000 plus employees?

298
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:20,350
So essentially they rolled out this program where they provided sick care that was free or low cost on health

299
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:27,670
onsite health services for their employees in appointments that were guaranteed to take no longer than 30 minutes.

300
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:35,110
They did a health IQ, 15 minute preventative health screening with these employees.

301
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:40,840
Well, visits and general health physical exams guaranteed to last no more than 45 minutes.

302
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:44,709
Wellness resources such as smoking cessation.

303
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:48,580
Weight Watchers Choose My Place, classes and Exercise Facilities,

304
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:56,080
referrals to primary care and behavioral health with direct referrals to primary care providers and employee assistance programs.

305
00:33:56,830 --> 00:34:01,150
And they did do a return on investment evaluation.

306
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:13,959
So they gained $4 for every $1 they spent in primary prevention back in terms of reduced sick days, reduced turnover,

307
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:22,240
reduced health care costs for employee insurance and other perks included continued regulatory compliance,

308
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:29,560
increased productivity, employee satisfaction and retention cost avoided due to disease management.

309
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:34,030
So this one actually sounds like pretty nice, right?

310
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:45,370
I would love to have onsite health care. I'm sure whatever manager who got the full realized is a $4 per $1 spent return on investment, obviously.

311
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:52,870
Yeah, they're pretty counts about that. I mean, I guess we don't have onsite care, but since we're right here next to the hospital,

312
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:57,909
I'd just like, you know, bop bop over for a blood draw or whatever.

313
00:34:57,910 --> 00:35:04,990
But it's it's not always like that. Right. And it depends on how well, like what the uptake is among employees.

314
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:10,060
So I will say my mom is also a nurse at a nursing home, as I'm sure I previously discussed.

315
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:19,120
And she does get a physical exam once a year just to make sure that she's not going to hurt herself on the job.

316
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:28,380
But the physician is a retired physician who does this for like at a very discounted rate.

317
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:36,370
I think he's hard of hearing because two years in a row, he told my mom she had a heart murmur and she freaked out.

318
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:39,969
And then she went to Kaiser to her main PCP to get that checked.

319
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:43,720
And they were like, you don't know, you don't have a murmur.

320
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:48,430
And I was like, Okay, yeah, I probably, probably.

321
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:52,690
But I mean, can we think of any workplaces that kind of have this model?

322
00:35:57,490 --> 00:36:00,110
I'm kind of working with that. You should be in Texas.

323
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:09,860
They have they're not inside, but they'll have connections to like in big cities where you go, okay, it's like you can go in there.

324
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:14,479
And now mostly it's for if you hurt yourself, it's like, Oh, go to the doctor.

325
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:20,630
We know them can get it fast kind of thing. So can I really Google?

326
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:29,230
After KLA and after that stuff similar to it, not quite to that level that might have worked for Beaumont,

327
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:33,760
which is still kind of like that since their hospital system.

328
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:45,520
But I met a. I have friends who are I better formally facebook such Instagram Nike apple.

329
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:52,480
So if you work for these large industries, they basically have giant campuses,

330
00:36:52,480 --> 00:37:03,130
essentially where they offer you the full range of not only onsite health care, gym, free food, exercise classes, bless you.

331
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:09,460
Even like on shot on site barbers and like you can get your haircut there.

332
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:13,510
They have now paws. You can bring your dog.

333
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:17,890
Why would you do all of that? Why would they do all that? ROBERTSON Exxon.

334
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:21,520
Exxon. Yeah, they work longer. Exactly.

335
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:27,219
Yeah. You never have to leave. Yeah, you get there. You know, it's it's kind of creepy.

336
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:31,780
I mean, Kayla is in Silicon Valley. They get the vibe, all the good hoodies and stuff.

337
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:37,180
Like, literally, though, it's so people, like, stay, like, 8:00 at night and come back.

338
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:49,060
It's crazy. I think I think there probably could be some studies on the employee wellness of working ADR weeks, even if their place is really nice.

339
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:55,740
Yeah, Microsoft is like that too. If I worked at a place like that, my office is not like that.

340
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:58,840
I try really hard. If you come visit me up there, it looks like a prison.

341
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:06,640
So I try to make it cute though. But if I had worked at a place like that, I would just rent the cheapest,

342
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:14,049
smallest studio apartment and just, like, go back there and sleep sometimes if I needed to.

343
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:17,410
But I'd be the kind of person who, like, literally lives at work.

344
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:26,350
They say if you only work your whole living then and just, you know, have breakfast at the computer, dinner at the computer.

345
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:36,400
Or do you think you'd have the Division one? Oh, no, the sidewalk, the revolving from, like, engineers to sleeping spots.

346
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:43,230
And we're like, cool. But like, that has to go because it's like you're in a closet, like, bunch of flammable substances.

347
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:54,340
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. There's an apple, uh, here in Ann Arbor, uh, an apple satellite on Industrial Parkway.

348
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:59,530
Kind of like in a store. Like a facility. Like a facility for engineers.

349
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:03,580
The store in Braidwood is terrible. I've been there so many times, so I don't.

350
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:07,930
But, you know, obviously, yeah, the purpose is for you to stay there and work.

351
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:16,060
But like, the workers are happier. Microsoft has a and Google have a really low turnover rate because you make good money.

352
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:23,590
If you live in Silicon Valley, they have shuttles to pick people up from their house with wi fi.

353
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:26,510
So you can start working when you're on the shuttle, right.

354
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:35,200
The shuttle you talk make a really good salary for friends that I have who work at Metta when it was still Facebook,

355
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,110
their husband and wife, they both work there.

356
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:45,639
Uh, they gained what they call a Facebook 20 when you start working there cause all the food is free, right?

357
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:50,220
And you just take the snacks, and then every day they would just one of them.

358
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:52,510
These are people I worked with at the satire newspaper.

359
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:59,860
So one would just post a series of like, what were the things they threw into the water that day to make the flavored water?

360
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:07,599
So it's just like giant chunks of like watermelon or like pineapple or like berries and herbs and stuff.

361
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:15,309
It looks really kush looks really nice. I'd like to tour one of those places one day, but it is partially.

362
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:20,200
Yeah, but I'll be curious to see a study on like work life balance in these places.

363
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:29,830
Nige, which I visited the headquarters in Morgantown, West Virginia, that you have a gym facility in the basement for employees.

364
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:34,749
And the Old School of Public Health that I used to work with at Indiana University.

365
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:43,000
The gym was in the same building, which was really nice, but it also kind of was weird because it was like, you know,

366
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:48,969
you'd have like eight indoor basketball courts and then an indoor running track and then you'd walk by the hallway in

367
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:56,350
that communal area where the students said overlooks an indoor swimming pool that kids come in like take classes with.

368
00:40:56,350 --> 00:41:02,950
And then you there were dance studios. You have like little girls running around in tutus all over, and there's just like students.

369
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:08,019
And then you go in the next hallway and just by the faculty offices, it was an interesting building,

370
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:12,850
but I definitely went to the gym more because I just like would literally walk down the hallway.

371
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:17,830
I'm not going to be doesn't ask about the gym you have to use.

372
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:21,850
I don't use I don't go to the gym. It's okay.

373
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:29,230
But plus they're like going to tear it down and soon they have a big tent.

374
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:34,450
I live near the one in the north and that's not that. That's not bad.

375
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:44,049
Yeah. Oh, yeah. So I also I think I'm beyond the point where it's like I want to work out with 18 year olds that's very close to an edge to them.

376
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:45,190
And I'm single undergrads.

377
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:51,520
Yeah, I've been, like, running outside on, like, during the day where I have to go run on the treadmill and be around underground.

378
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:56,470
Oh, I have a treadmill in my house because I don't like being outside.

379
00:41:56,500 --> 00:42:03,180
But also the sidewalks are really uneven. So kudos to you because I'm that kind of person where if I take a look at the sidewalk the whole time,

380
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:06,700
yeah, if you take me hiking, I'm not looking at the trees.

381
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:13,120
I'm looking at the ground. Yeah, yeah, that's me. How many of you own stuff from L.L. Bean?

382
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:23,440
No, it's a very New England thing. So L.L. Bean had a safety reserve redesign jumpstart for their aging workforce.

383
00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:32,470
So L.L. Bean is one of those companies that try to be on the cutting edge, looking beyond safety and health infrastructure to optimize work processes.

384
00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:37,209
So many of the workers who work at L.L. Bean, this is like a lifelong job.

385
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:42,910
People really like working at L.L. Bean. It's like Costco. If I don't get tenure, I want to work at Costco.

386
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:49,690
I told you I did. I have. Okay. And if I move to another city and I'm moving out, there's a Costco.

387
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:52,780
But these are physically demanding jobs.

388
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:59,830
But people still generally like work there, on average, 25 to 30 years and the average employee age is 50 at L.L. Bean.

389
00:43:00,490 --> 00:43:05,979
So prior to the total worker health approach, they were already doing some pretty good things,

390
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:13,900
like shift rotation for material handling, three sets of five minute paid rests, which they generally don't let.

391
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:18,850
You have paid rest unless you're in California and daily stretch breaks.

392
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:29,590
So with L.L. Bean, what they did with this total worker health intervention was they implemented technologies such as robotics back in,

393
00:43:29,590 --> 00:43:38,919
drifted lift assists and adjustable lift pallets, and they piloted Jumpstart, which was a voluntary cardiovascular conditioning program,

394
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:44,380
12 weeks long supervised aerobics, strength training, paid time.

395
00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:54,250
You can do it while you're at work. And they had a consultation with a physical therapist to add customized program components for their job task.

396
00:43:55,720 --> 00:44:01,540
And yeah, overall, it was a very successful program that reduced injuries and improved well-being.

397
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:06,640
So this was a pretty well executed total worker health intervention.

398
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:14,720
So let's talk now about a systematic review of total worker health interventions.

399
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:21,560
So you remember to work out this really new concept. So keep in mind this systematic review came out in 2016.

400
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:32,179
So it looked at ten. It looked at 15 studies total that had done total worker health interventions up until that point.

401
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:40,400
But generally with systematic reviews, it takes a full year to do a proper systematic review because you have to register it

402
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:44,960
with the database and make sure no one else is working on the same systematic review.

403
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:49,910
You are so likely they're just capturing studies up to 2015.

404
00:44:50,450 --> 00:44:57,350
Ten of the 15 studies that they looked at had high risk of bias assessment.

405
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:01,880
Okay, so these are direct quotes,

406
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:14,000
findings graded low strength of evidence on improving smoking cessation as measured by self-reported seven day abstinence over 22 to 26 weeks.

407
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:19,700
There were two randomized controlled trials who did this with about 800 participants,

408
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:27,679
and then another total worker health intervention category was increasing the consumption of fruits and vegetables anywhere

409
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:36,170
between 26 to 104 weeks for three different types of randomized controlled trials that had about 6000 workers in it.

410
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:44,930
And the results apply to populations of blue collar manufacturing and construction industries predominantly.

411
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:54,010
So they tried to start off with like really literally like low hanging fruit, like fruit consumption, but also smoking cessation.

412
00:45:54,020 --> 00:46:00,679
Okay. Findings graded as having low S.O.

413
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:11,450
We supported this as a effect size of the effectiveness of total worker health interventions for reducing sedentary work behavior and office workers.

414
00:46:11,870 --> 00:46:22,820
16 to 52 weeks to rc ts evidence was insufficient or lacking for other outcomes of interest, such as work rates, injuries, quality of life and harms.

415
00:46:23,570 --> 00:46:31,530
Okay. Why do you think these interventions didn't work?

416
00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:35,640
I mean, total worker health seems like an awesome, cool idea, right?

417
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:40,620
Oh, I didn't. I couldn't help, but there is no effect.

418
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:46,860
I feel like it's probably a first off, really hard to study.

419
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:52,160
I mean, like, I mean, there's high variance and what is a total worker health intervention?

420
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:57,260
And then there's different side qualities and then also the individual workers and the responsiveness to it.

421
00:46:57,270 --> 00:47:03,620
And I mean, so there's so many factors and it's not like there's a standard total worker health intervention.

422
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:08,150
And so I guess I feel like maybe that didn't go statistically.

423
00:47:08,570 --> 00:47:20,480
Yeah. Yeah. Other than that. I think I like to really change the environment at work, but then the environment outside of work was still the same.

424
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:25,250
Potentially, yeah. I mean, that's.

425
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:34,650
Which ones are we talking about? Which of the like is a systematic review, including like some of the ones that we went over?

426
00:47:35,070 --> 00:47:43,940
No, no, no. So this systematic review across 15 studies of different interventions using total worker health,

427
00:47:43,950 --> 00:47:51,330
the general effect size on creating any like notable health impact was really low.

428
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:57,720
Could also be. Like.

429
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:12,800
I'm kind of with the organization like the employer was like leaving the assessment potentially more biased in that way.

430
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:17,659
Yeah. Yeah. Risk of bias potentially. That's definitely a possibility.

431
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:25,610
You'll notice some of these are as little as four months and some of these are as much as a two year intervention, the 104 weeks.

432
00:48:26,090 --> 00:48:30,170
Right. So it's not like it was sort of like a short burst of something like that.

433
00:48:30,590 --> 00:48:34,730
But in terms of administering an intervention.

434
00:48:37,470 --> 00:48:45,360
Not only does it have to be administered correctly, but that the data has to be collected and analyzed properly.

435
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:49,350
Rate So risk of bias assessment like it's it is a huge issue there.

436
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,020
And then yeah, I think that might be a huge one.

437
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:59,190
Bridge is only targeting the workplace in particular or not necessarily thinking about family systems, right?

438
00:48:59,190 --> 00:49:12,240
So just say, for example, some of these behaviors I would argue is, uh, integrated into the work or the work family life sphere.

439
00:49:12,630 --> 00:49:15,360
So I'm going to make some sweeping generalizations. Okay.

440
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:22,380
So we're talking about blue collar manufacturing and construction workers, which is probably like mostly men.

441
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:27,060
Who do you think is responsible for grocery shopping at their house?

442
00:49:27,090 --> 00:49:33,389
I was going to say, like, I mean, they're probably the ones buying the fruits and vegetables, but none of the interventions,

443
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:37,320
if you're ever told work to eat more veggies like they're not changed circumstances,

444
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:41,760
you either pay or your grocery store bill availability or all that kind of stuff.

445
00:49:41,790 --> 00:49:50,970
Right. Right. It would be totally different if the intervention, for example, like, you know, okay, like here at Michigan Medicine,

446
00:49:51,300 --> 00:50:01,890
they do they bring a farmer's market to the hospital like two times a year where it's in the inner courtyard of the university hospital.

447
00:50:01,890 --> 00:50:09,750
I would like it to be more often, but it would be different if they brought like a farmer's market to the worksite.

448
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:18,480
Like when I was a student at UC San Diego every Tuesday we had a farmers market on campus that would come and it would be different food vendors,

449
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:22,919
but also like you could buy like locally and freshly sourced,

450
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:27,749
like fruits and vegetables and stuff, and you could use what we had like a Triton card,

451
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:31,049
which is like your cart here where you can like load money on it.

452
00:50:31,050 --> 00:50:34,200
And they accepted that as a form of payment and all that kind of stuff.

453
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:43,920
So it doesn't really say because the systematic review mostly looks at process and then about and then outcomes.

454
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:46,830
They don't necessarily look at implementation,

455
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:57,090
they're mostly looking at effect size and they don't necessarily take into consideration extraneous factors or barriers to implementation.

456
00:50:58,230 --> 00:51:03,450
Um, also, 2016 was a really early time, right?

457
00:51:03,450 --> 00:51:08,459
So I would love for somebody to try to do a systematic review of total worker health

458
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:13,740
interventions again in maybe five years from now and see how the results might be different.

459
00:51:14,730 --> 00:51:23,310
Okay. The last one, the last thing we have and we don't have to do break out groups because there's only the four of us, one group.

460
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:24,270
One group.

461
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:37,200
So imagine you are like an industrial hygienist or like an environmental safety and safety and health professional at the University of Michigan here.

462
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:46,860
So what total work or health practices or policies or programs would you try to implement here to improve employee health?

463
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:53,370
So let's tackle that first and then we'll we'll see how that might be different if we were like focused on Amazon.

464
00:51:54,030 --> 00:51:58,140
So what do you think we could do here to try to improve improve employee health?

465
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:08,070
What part of the University of Michigan I would have like the faculty, students or other staff, let's say staff and faculty.

466
00:52:08,550 --> 00:52:11,610
Yeah, definitely. Ergonomics, yeah.

467
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:16,799
Be a priority thing. Yeah, I had an ergonomics assessment.

468
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:23,450
It was free, but to find the link, to sign up to do it was very, very difficult.

469
00:52:24,270 --> 00:52:31,950
The whole campus has like two ergonomics and they have to like come to your office and measure you and measure your desk.

470
00:52:31,950 --> 00:52:39,870
And then after that, she wrote like a formal letter to my department head saying like, this is hers issues.

471
00:52:39,870 --> 00:52:45,870
So if she needs to buy these things like you should letter kind of thing, that's nice, you know.

472
00:52:45,870 --> 00:52:54,480
So it, it was very comprehensive. But the fact that it's not just like offered as like part of the employee onboarding, you need way more.

473
00:52:55,260 --> 00:53:01,110
Yeah yeah. We didn't do that you need and people have to be a certified or gotten us to do it

474
00:53:01,290 --> 00:53:04,770
we'll have a guest lecture from the certified you're gonna miss later this semester.

475
00:53:05,130 --> 00:53:08,490
I'm even heard of that. Really? Oh, okay.

476
00:53:08,490 --> 00:53:13,950
So Sheryl's, like, guest lecture for you should be fine. What else would you try to implement here?

477
00:53:14,730 --> 00:53:20,550
Probably, like mental health screenings and then, like, referrals to specialists.

478
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:26,129
Yeah, yeah. Or like seasonal depression. Yeah. I was going to say, like, I think of the looming winters.

479
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:32,200
I think you have some kind of program to get in either winter outdoor activities or something to get people moving.

480
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:36,080
Something that also, I don't know, was in Gray's Anatomy.

481
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:39,840
Me they have like in the hospital, like they put a room with a bunch of.

482
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:42,950
Yeah. Nothing to say. Oh, okay.

483
00:53:43,250 --> 00:53:49,350
We are essentially just complicated plans. I have a blue light lamp in my office.

484
00:53:49,370 --> 00:53:55,110
I don't feel like it really helps me. And I do get sad, sad, sad.

485
00:53:55,130 --> 00:54:00,650
When the sun sets earlier. Interestingly, I'm surprised they don't have one here.

486
00:54:00,650 --> 00:54:05,090
But when I worked at at the University of Nebraska Med Center in the middle of campus,

487
00:54:05,090 --> 00:54:12,190
we had a ice skating rink so students and staff could ice skate, but they also had a broom.

488
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:16,010
What are they called? Broom ball? Yeah, not Roomba.

489
00:54:16,490 --> 00:54:19,490
Vroom, vroom, but Roomba, hockey. That skates.

490
00:54:19,940 --> 00:54:23,299
And you have rooms where you are, right? Yeah. And they also have that.

491
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:30,200
What's the thing where you like shuffle the big thingy. Oh they do it up curly.

492
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:35,480
Curly. They have curly teams do that consists of like faculty, staff, students.

493
00:54:35,510 --> 00:54:39,650
That would be fun. Yeah, that would be fun. I don't think they have anything like that here.

494
00:54:39,770 --> 00:54:45,820
I think that helps a lot with like because you have the exercise component of that dark and and you have like the community component.

495
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:47,749
Yeah. So socialization. Yeah.

496
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:56,810
So I think that's great idea for like getting people not see like getting like activities to make people not seasonally depressed are their thoughts.

497
00:54:57,110 --> 00:55:01,459
So it's funny looking at auto worker health because I mean, I guess less so for University of Michigan,

498
00:55:01,460 --> 00:55:09,080
but it was this becomes a radicalizing thing for me where it's like if people's jobs are so inexpensive,

499
00:55:09,330 --> 00:55:12,590
like at Amazon, I mean, it's like, you know, how it would improve total worker health.

500
00:55:12,590 --> 00:55:16,879
Like maybe a lot of people lose bathroom breaks or I don't know, like maybe not having is hard,

501
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:22,520
stressful and poorly paid jobs and stuff and like you can't really just recommend that an adult person.

502
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:27,020
And so it's like a weirdly constrained, um. Oh, yeah.

503
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:32,480
Oh, it's not radical at all. My first, my first class that I taught this, they were very pro-union.

504
00:55:33,110 --> 00:55:40,320
So it was always just like burn down the boss, further down the system, burn it all down.

505
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:44,840
I was like, All right. And they also like to joke a lot about pizza parties.

506
00:55:45,350 --> 00:55:51,470
Um, I think that a lot of improvements employee have have to start with leadership.

507
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:59,360
So there are a lot of toxic structures that are still really ingrained in this university system.

508
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:06,169
And there's only so much you can do where you feel like you're like trying to swim against, against the tide.

509
00:56:06,170 --> 00:56:14,020
Right? Um, but those things are very hard to change because some people just like things the way they are and

510
00:56:14,210 --> 00:56:20,780
then people just leave other thoughts for total world practices and like a university setting.

511
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:36,180
What about if you were an Amazon? Let's let's give let's it let's give people the right to pee and take breaks and take off like quotas.

512
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:37,910
Right. Okay, let's let's do all that.

513
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:46,730
What would you what would you do if it was like Amazon facility for total work or help consider ergonomics again.

514
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:54,040
Yeah. Ergonomics. Uh huh. I don't know if I show it to you in this class or not.

515
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:57,429
My brain is very foggy sometimes,

516
00:56:57,430 --> 00:57:02,829
but there's cute many YouTube videos you can look out online at like Honda facilities in Japan where they

517
00:57:02,830 --> 00:57:09,129
do mandatory daily stretching with both their manufacturing office workers side and their office workers.

518
00:57:09,130 --> 00:57:12,380
That is stretching from where they walk like 20 miles a day or so.

519
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:17,229
Yeah, yeah. But good shoes, they do it over like this, the the speaker system.

520
00:57:17,230 --> 00:57:20,790
So everybody like simultaneously does all these stretches.

521
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:22,600
It's adorable, but also effective.

522
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:31,870
Um, like, does that mean, you know, like the Western culture, it's like, man, that would be so weird to, like, stop and do your stretches.

523
00:57:31,870 --> 00:57:36,609
I'd feel maybe this is my ideal work in minutes or stretching.

524
00:57:36,610 --> 00:57:42,790
Yeah, cause you're on the clock, like. Yeah, I feel like it is more culturally accepted there and like, you know,

525
00:57:42,790 --> 00:57:51,759
in China they do that to like in school you do like large PE classes or you might do like taichi in large group settings in the park,

526
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:58,570
a lot of like communal exercise. I think people are less self-conscious there perhaps.

527
00:57:58,810 --> 00:58:02,710
No, it benefits everybody. So it's just like why care if it's benefiting us.

528
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:06,610
Yeah. Like the same thing with mask wearing right. Mhm.

529
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:15,760
Yeah. Yeah. Amazon's wild. I saw again I was watching Tik Tok last night and you know with her and going on right now

530
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:22,240
they were looking at flight paths and there is one plane going into the eye of the storm.

531
00:58:22,270 --> 00:58:29,050
It has the, the Jeff Bezos from Bo Burnham's special.

532
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:34,239
Uh, they sent a plane for BA to the eye of the storm.

533
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:38,370
It was a prime Amazon Prime plane because you know the song like see?

534
00:58:38,410 --> 00:58:50,590
Yeah, yeah, that one. Anyway, I used to have a video on justifying the need or value for total worker health to management in terms of our airline.

535
00:58:50,590 --> 00:58:53,740
Was a quick two minute video but is now gone.

536
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:59,980
Uh, as of this year. It worked last year, so I don't have to show it to you anymore.

537
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:05,440
But I did have. Ideally, the way you would justify the need or value is the return on investment,

538
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:09,490
like the nursing one, where it's like for every dollar you spend you get $4 back.

539
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:14,530
But in order to do that, you have to successfully, number one, implement the intervention,

540
00:59:14,530 --> 00:59:20,320
but track that data long enough to show that ah oh but money talks.

541
00:59:20,620 --> 00:59:29,469
I know. And I mean this probably works for like an Amazon ground level employees, but I mean, I don't particularly like the Silicon Valley companies.

542
00:59:29,470 --> 00:59:31,940
They're really big about talent retention and recruitment.

543
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:39,010
So like that's one of the biggest business cases where if it helps you tractor keep talent, then that's worth it.

544
00:59:39,010 --> 00:59:45,400
Some positive result. Yeah, I was told when I was hired and I'm not sure if this is true or not,

545
00:59:47,380 --> 01:00:00,670
but to hire a tenure track assistant professor over the course of their career is about a $1 million investment to put that through.

546
01:00:01,540 --> 01:00:07,140
So they want to protect that investment. Do you feel like $1,000,000?

547
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:10,590
No, I don't.
