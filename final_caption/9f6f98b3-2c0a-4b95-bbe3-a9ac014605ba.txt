2
00:00:06,439 --> 00:00:09,090
So what is public health?

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:12,839
Well, for one thing,
it's under-appreciated.

4
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:17,480
It's invisible on the occasions
in which it works best.

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:22,490
When a disease doesn't exist any
longer because of public health,

6
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:28,290
pubic health has been enormously
successful, but nobody thinks about it.

7
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:33,741
As a consequence, public health is
under-funded,it's under-practiced,

8
00:00:33,741 --> 00:00:36,040
and it is difficult.

9
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:39,965
It's in exceedingly
politically challenging field.

10
00:00:39,965 --> 00:00:43,254
It requires an expert mix of science and

11
00:00:43,254 --> 00:00:49,340
politics that eludes almost
every field of endeavor.

12
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:55,576
And last but certainly not least,
public health is truly important.

13
00:00:55,576 --> 00:01:02,396
I hope that what we've discussed gives
you a sense of why it is so important.
