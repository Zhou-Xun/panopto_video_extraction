1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,680
Investigation of stochastic process. A quick review.

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,850
So last time we are.

3
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:16,070
So the lecture for the main theme of Electric Forward is really trying to connect

4
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:22,180
the sequence to functions or how to deal with probability generating function.

5
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:29,600
That's really the theme. So last time we talk about a convolution, as I said, you know,

6
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:35,929
for this cause you only need to understand the terminologies and mathematical

7
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:41,540
terminology when you have two sequences convolution corresponding to operation,

8
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,600
basically mash the two sequences together.

9
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,710
Right. There is very specific definition how.

10
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:55,740
Convolution is defined and how can you calculate it in the.

11
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:03,340
In practice, the more important concept is generating function.

12
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:07,990
So we gave a rather general definition about convolution.

13
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:17,820
If you're trying to connect, the sequence represents a sequence to a function that you can use,

14
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:26,980
construct a polynomial function with the terms in the sequence as the corresponding coefficient, right?

15
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:34,720
And it's this way. So one of the mathematical concern is this kind of a relationship.

16
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:47,469
Does it exist? So. So the calculus tells us if there is exist as a non-negative or if there is a positive convergence radius,

17
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:55,960
that you can define this relationship, at least for some function that's just right as defined.

18
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:15,990
Couple of times. See you so far.

19
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,510
That's the last time for you. This is the converters radius.

20
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:27,820
And then we give us specific a more general.

21
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:33,250
Sorry. As a more specific application of generating function while we connect.

22
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:47,140
The the sequence to probability distribution, especially the probability distribution for non negatives of an integer value run the variable.

23
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:50,590
Right. So there the AIS has a specific meaning.

24
00:02:51,630 --> 00:03:00,220
The eye, each of the eye corresponding to the probability of the random variable taking value by at this point.

25
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:09,010
Right this way. Hi.

26
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,760
So turn by turn. So you see, this follows the general definition.

27
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:25,670
And this one is what we call the probability generating function is only for non negative integer value, random variable,

28
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:36,260
but nevertheless we have is rather a statistical representation or probabilistic representation of the run.

29
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:42,790
So I suppose that's the important thing.

30
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:47,480
This one we're going to use quite often throughout the course.

31
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,570
So the general reading function has a lot of benefit.

32
00:03:51,590 --> 00:04:00,110
One of those, the general property is if you know the generating function, you can recover the individual terms.

33
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:07,850
Last time we said that. We're going to illustrate today. The other thing is, if you have to run the variables,

34
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:14,690
both non-negative by integer values and how you want to calculate that the sum

35
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:22,880
of the other person is a new random variable that you can easily find the sum,

36
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:25,310
the the new random variables,

37
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:33,830
the probability distribution of the new random variable of the sum through a simple operation of this probability generating function.

38
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:38,420
We're going to do that. We're going to illustrate this point again today.

39
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:44,870
All right. So that's the not so quick reveal, but any questions so far?

40
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:56,640
Or it's not. So first the first point, what the convenience of generating function Y generating function is so useful.

41
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:05,520
So last time we just mentioned the example of the Fibonacci sequence.

42
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:14,550
So the Fibonacci sequence is well known. And so.

43
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:32,600
So it's defined us as 002011.

44
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:39,950
And then from this point on, here is a rule connecting the next term to the previous two.

45
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,570
Right? Just compute simply compute the sum.

46
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:52,860
So I have two equal to one, two, three, four, two, one plus one is two and three and then so on and so forth.

47
00:05:52,890 --> 00:06:04,260
So in more generally, we can write f k, so the K term equals K minus one, k minus two.

48
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:11,700
So we're dealing with sequence here. Right. So those 40 define the the sequence.

49
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:23,280
So K has to be greater equal to two. So this is recursive or this relationship, the sequence relationship defined in for K is greater or equal to two.

50
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:31,240
And then that we need to specify what about the values for s zero and I for one.

51
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:36,290
So usually that's complete. 0012.

52
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:41,930
So everything is fine. This point, actually, they're just combining this.

53
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:52,220
So I'm just going to about this and I say this definition fully defining the Fibonacci sequence, right?

54
00:06:53,390 --> 00:07:00,290
So so mathematically you can compute any term of Fibonacci sequence.

55
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:04,240
So this is because, you know, 0f1.

56
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:11,390
If I gave you a formula and you just do this operation many, many times, close the moment in time.

57
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:18,020
Once you do that, you figure out what the corresponding term is.

58
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,920
But that's time consuming, right? What about a thousand?

59
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:31,160
And I think that's. Is there a way we can find the general expression of f k?

60
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:38,650
So this is defined by the previous sequence, and we have like a functional representation of that.

61
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:53,310
Just in general. Okay. So we could find this through the application of.

62
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:03,080
Generating function in this case is not a probability generating function.

63
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:20,240
So if you are trying to define the function generating function, you need to you need to at least show the converters really does exist.

64
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:24,680
Right. So that's not our purpose. I would just give you.

65
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:32,090
So the solution.

66
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:42,500
All right. So wait first. So we going to construct a generating function.

67
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:49,980
You have this form, so let's define. I used to go fast.

68
00:08:53,510 --> 00:09:04,680
Some of us just simply some patient zero to infinity while we're doing it right this term.

69
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:11,760
Okay. So for any sequence, you're kind of right this way.

70
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:17,070
So you'll have a sequence of numbers you can always define.

71
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:25,680
But if this is a valid definition, depends on if there is a valid convergence radius.

72
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:37,950
Right. That's not the kind of show I'm going to remember how to calculate convert as a radius.

73
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:55,230
It's not liquid. It's about it's in so sorry limits of of the absolute value of a to the one or n I say two f that's the radius.

74
00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:00,610
Right. I'm just trying to get some.

75
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:04,780
Yes. Okay.

76
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,890
So this is a definition of. Ah. So you can calculate this.

77
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:20,630
I'm not trying to do this calculation right now. So turns out if you do this calculation, you also need to use the recursive relationship.

78
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:27,980
Right. But at the end of the day, you should be able to find the R exists and then greater than zero.

79
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:33,160
All right. I'm not going to do that here. You do it after the class.

80
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:36,300
If you have difficulty finding R, let me know.

81
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,250
We could solve this in the office. Fair enough.

82
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:45,710
So, yes, this is the right way to find the to find the the the radius.

83
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:52,219
I think in the exam, you don't need to worry about that because we got mostly done a deal with probability generating function.

84
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:58,190
And as I said, that there is a very natural convergence radius.

85
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:03,410
But just for this problem, this is not the it's not a probability generating function.

86
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:09,890
So you need to explicitly compute the convergence radius or so that doesn't exist.

87
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:14,130
Okay, good. Okay.

88
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:20,270
All right. So this does exist. Air conditional.

89
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:24,750
You have done the calculation.

90
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,990
All right. So why this is useful?

91
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:41,140
So the general strategy of using generating function is to turn that recursive relationship in the sequence to a functional equation.

92
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:45,300
So that means the equation among the functions. All right.

93
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:48,930
How could we do that? So it's pretty straightforward.

94
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:52,820
And this is kind of a universal strategy.

95
00:11:53,190 --> 00:12:07,620
So if you have a K default, if you add a minus one plus or minus minus two 4K whenever equal to two.

96
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:12,630
Right. Always keep this condition on later.

97
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:25,480
All right. So for some, as in the previous, I will just say this, that I would just augment that.

98
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:40,460
So this is always. Right. Right. And multiply every term to as to the K as to the case.

99
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:44,130
To the case for something for something within the radius.

100
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,210
So this is this is always correct as long.

101
00:12:52,030 --> 00:13:00,150
And if you. All right, so.

102
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,520
So this is what we want. So this is about us.

103
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:07,450
Okay. Okay. So this one.

104
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:12,730
The coefficient. And then the power doesn't match.

105
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:25,330
We should match it. And the same thing here is just trying to match the coefficient.

106
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:31,500
And the corresponding paper was the benefit of matching those.

107
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:38,220
So you will see that is what we're gonna do. Operation Sum over all possible case.

108
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,879
Right. So the K at this point is pretty general for I think we are equal to two and then we're

109
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:49,890
going to do a summation for all of the case because the equation holds for all case.

110
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:56,220
Right. Imagine you of write case for the two to infinity and then just send them over.

111
00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:05,110
Right. So the left hand side you get, hey, you got two, two, three, infinity.

112
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:09,340
Remember, you can only do this. The boundary is important.

113
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:16,400
If you if you don't respect the boundary that you're not, you are not going to get the correct answer in the end.

114
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:24,460
So you'll always respect the boundary of this office.

115
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:38,169
So you're going to do the summation f k s equal to as the summation.

116
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:38,650
Okay.

117
00:14:39,370 --> 00:15:13,180
To let's first that just to rewrite everything, keep everything just one thing at a time, like got some action and all right, so, so we get some.

118
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:27,610
So we get something close enough to the generating function, the definition generating function.

119
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:32,290
But noticeably something is missing, especially the first term.

120
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:37,230
What's missing? They're missing two terms.

121
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:48,990
Right. So the the polyp, the generating function would start from K equal to zero, but the left hand side starts with K go through k k 22.

122
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:56,700
Right. So that's not completely generating function, but that's because only in finite terms missing.

123
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:04,799
So for the left hand side, we could do all right.

124
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,970
So it's not the generating function, but it's close,

125
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:26,309
it's the generating function g of mass subtract the the intercept term and then the first F1 f1 is one.

126
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:30,810
So it just right and then zero is one.

127
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:36,870
So. Well, I mean, let me write this as a zero over minus F1 as.

128
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,490
Okay. So what about the the second term?

129
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:55,159
Let's do that this term first. Okay. So we're going to do something.

130
00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:02,780
It's very much like when you do integral like change of variable because the coefficient actually matches.

131
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:12,710
If you redefine the index as K minus two as a K prime, now you see the sequence is actually running from zero to infinity.

132
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:20,989
Yeah. So notice li. So the key for the two then this is a as zero s to the zero.

133
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:29,020
That's f052. So you notice that. So the second term is actually s square times last.

134
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:35,420
So similarly, you could do the this trick to the first term.

135
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:43,010
So that's the first term actually starts from F one as an F two as.

136
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:53,990
So it's actually a claim is s times g of s missing the first term, the intercept term f zero.

137
00:17:55,490 --> 00:18:02,420
All right. Right. So this is an all fancy operation by the end of the day.

138
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:12,910
You've turned that sequence relationship into a functional equation here, the functional relationship about generating functions.

139
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:19,940
All right. So this is a you need to realize this is a there is a swap order at first.

140
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:29,840
Let me read this. So transparency, that's the that will be the ultimate.

141
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:35,390
Yes. And that will be the perfect mapping the on the abarth line.

142
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:49,800
But so. So we know as zero you go to the what's the boundary S0 equals zero and then I fly equal to one and then you can collect terms altogether.

143
00:18:49,960 --> 00:19:05,500
So you get this equation. Let's look at where we are fast.

144
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:14,860
What we are looking for is a general representation of the general working, functioning job that you've got.

145
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:24,340
So we got our flesh.

146
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:31,540
So that's I'll be the solution.

147
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:42,910
That will be the generating function. So this particular function looks and may be quite strange to you.

148
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:50,530
It is indeed generating function of the Fibonacci sequence.

149
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:57,430
How could you confirm this? Well, this is actually a proof.

150
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:59,250
Right. So.

151
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:08,250
Well, I mean, if we do everything here correctly, but if you're trying to validate, you can always use the relationship, trying to calculate.

152
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:15,140
Uh, um. Differentiate this term.

153
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:21,040
And I'm trying to figure out if you get the right term right so you get F0 F1.

154
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:31,400
Last time we talk about how to recover the individual sequence in individual terms in the sequence through the generating function.

155
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:44,570
So that will be the one way to do it. If you want f well if you want f zero, you're just evaluated as equal to zero zero divided by one.

156
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:48,440
So that's 000 is trivially true.

157
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:59,090
And if you want to calculate f one, take a derivative and evaluate as a as equal to zero again.

158
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:03,670
So you should so right. But this doesn't really achieve our goal, right?

159
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:09,259
We're trying to get some sort of a general term of I think this one doesn't and still doesn't

160
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:16,760
give us so the remaining thing we could actually get there but that requires a little bit.

161
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:23,940
So. But the idea is if you have a function like this.

162
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:28,320
Can you write that as a polynomial terms?

163
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,739
Right. So this is this is a function.

164
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:36,640
So we remember we have the sequence and then we get the function.

165
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,600
This function have a, you know, a different form.

166
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:45,190
This is not a polynomial sequence function.

167
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:54,250
So we need to turn that into can we do that. General thing is we get you can do Taylor expansion that's the same thing as do Cochrane derivative.

168
00:21:54,730 --> 00:22:04,060
But there is something else you can help. I kind of help you. So the way to do it is turn this into a geometric sequence.

169
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,920
So if you have a funky, this is now required.

170
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:15,940
So for illustration, I think those things are probably more for real analysis or even just calculus.

171
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:27,730
So in general, you could if a function is written like that, you could almost surely factor that into a C minus.

172
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:37,930
So this is undetermined the coefficient methods eight times S plus B plus the s.

173
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:45,880
So here a, b, c, d, e, f our coefficient that we're trying to figure out what they are.

174
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:52,240
The reason we're trying to write like this form because we know in this case if you have a C,

175
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:57,670
C divided by as plus B, you can turn that into a geometric sequence, right?

176
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:02,709
So this geometric sequence, the sum of the geometric sequence is sort of one function of form.

177
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:14,920
So this is also relationship between polynomial sequence and then there converge the function that's not really important.

178
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:22,990
But you see why this is, right? Because if you have any two functions like this and you're trying to compute the sum,

179
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:33,879
then you've got the quadratic function in the in the numerator and denominator and then the numerator is the also in general,

180
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:42,520
it's a is a linear term, right? The this one is CDSs plus C and then this is a linear function to solve.

181
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:47,200
So you can't say, I have a bunch of equations, I'm trying to solve it.

182
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:53,139
And I think the lecture notes, that's the more details how you can do it.

183
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,370
But in general,

184
00:23:54,850 --> 00:24:09,040
if you set up the equation and then required turn by turn the coefficient matches and then you can I find the g of that's going to be one.

185
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:23,650
So the amazing thing here is we have been dealing with integers all the time and then there's some place somewhere very rational numbers.

186
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:38,520
Just. I mean. Oh, sorry.

187
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:47,010
I mean, I need to do this first. So this one, if you do this, you'll find square root of five.

188
00:24:51,060 --> 00:25:01,380
Right. So the first one to see, for example, in this case sequel to the one the B is sorry is one,

189
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:06,300
then the eight is negative one plus square root five divided by two.

190
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:15,570
So I just write in a different way, one over one minus.

191
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:30,590
This may look complicated, but this is nothing more than just algebra if to figure out the average.

192
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:39,300
The hope to get the whole thing sorted out. There's nothing complicated, conceptually complicated about that operation.

193
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:52,360
But as I said, you have something like this C over 80 plus B now you can immediately say this is a geometric sequence, right?

194
00:25:52,380 --> 00:26:02,100
You can figure out the geometric sequence and then actually get back to the question we are interested in.

195
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:13,260
So if you have something one minus one minus eight times, as you know, this is.

196
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:25,020
They to, as I said earlier, I mean, for something like this, right.

197
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:30,960
The first car has to be on. Zero.

198
00:26:50,320 --> 00:27:06,580
Yeah. Anyway. All right, so I should write this one plus a plus A squared, plus this one is one one minus a.

199
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:13,840
Okay. So maybe that's the thing. I want to write it.

200
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:30,970
So. And then this is also the you also you can also figure out this or that, but the simple Taylor expansion sort of scheme anyway.

201
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:42,500
Okay. You could read right now with that particular functional form.

202
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:46,520
You get one over square root five.

203
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:56,690
So instead of a write in as a function, now you can go back to the polynomial sum.

204
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:30,360
As J minus. Okay.

205
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:38,450
So what this tells you is now you have.

206
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:48,030
The glass generating function written as a polynomial sequence so immediate for, you know, f j.

207
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:54,260
Just the JS term from this polynomials.

208
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:26,009
So that is a square with five. Yes.

209
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:40,990
They happen to happen here. Okay.

210
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:49,980
Even so, for some of you have studied the commentaries.

211
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:54,879
This is a well known results and sort of amazing results.

212
00:29:54,880 --> 00:30:04,140
Right. So any for any J Simple Integer, it gave you a integer all about the recursive relationship.

213
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:08,620
You can only get integers. And then this one is also the case.

214
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:13,150
If you are plugged in and j you get better. But that's still amazing.

215
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,020
I suppose you can have something square root five.

216
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:28,780
It's a rational number, and somehow the combination of that irrational number gave you integers.

217
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:34,390
Pretty amazing. But anyway, this is easy to compute.

218
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:40,900
If your figure using this, you can only get it from the generating function.

219
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:46,629
And then now if you're just trying to evaluate the milli and you don't need to start from zero because

220
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:54,730
you can just plug in the millionth to calculate this thing this relatively fast given to this computer.

221
00:30:55,240 --> 00:31:00,790
What's going to be approximation, right? All right.

222
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:05,380
So that's a pretty cool example to show so through.

223
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:13,620
The jury through the generating function, your first look at the representation and then our representation,

224
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:16,820
you can go back to the polynomial representation.

225
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:22,100
I think the general term we're going to use.

226
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:29,930
And so that's basically the the advantage of using generating function in this context.

227
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:33,590
Remember, those are equivalent to representation.

228
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:42,670
They don't either form, either the sequence form nor the the generating function for ad and the information.

229
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:49,660
But usually you have some convenience by looking at one particular form use.

230
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:55,620
Any questions? All right.

231
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:59,460
So the details, the Astros supposed to be in the electric zone.

232
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:02,850
So you can read more about in New Jersey. Interesting.

233
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:11,020
Also, very fine. But there is a convergence radius problem.

234
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:39,840
So this is just for show and tell on how you use it in general to our partners for stochastic process to using the the generating function.

235
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:59,489
We usually don't do this. However, the next example shows how we use in this in the probability complex so generating function,

236
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:09,390
so probably more probability generating function and convolution.

237
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:23,180
So this really put the two things together. So we could deal with the component random variable.

238
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:29,150
Remember the component random variable we talked about in the previous lecture?

239
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:38,570
Right. So we're going to sum over either run the variables, but the number of the random variable we're going to sum over.

240
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:41,990
So itself, it's a random variable. It's a random integer.

241
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:46,370
Right. So let me just write that, which is a Hong Kong.

242
00:33:51,260 --> 00:34:02,659
Right by our revolt. So this time we work on the non-negative integer value with random variable.

243
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:19,040
So it will be a constraint on the component in zero hundred, not negative integer value.

244
00:34:25,410 --> 00:34:29,170
Um, random variables.

245
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:38,550
So we're going to define as and so the factor, the fact of the compiler random variable is.

246
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:50,770
I thought we'd have an exciting idea.

247
00:34:52,840 --> 00:35:01,630
So we're going to require X-Y. The component of this random sample itself is non-negative integer value.

248
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:08,050
Right. So that makes the essence, the sum itself, the negative integer about it.

249
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:14,420
That's the support. And the other than not, the they are independent.

250
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:19,030
And that and here is also a random variable.

251
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:30,160
We're going to have a random sample of this. And.

252
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:57,960
You can't write this one. This is. One half to two thirds, just general distribution or just represent the distribution, but be aware of the support.

253
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:04,580
Everything here is going to be integer value, not negative integer value.

254
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:15,000
As excite and as I said. So the question here last time we compute the expected value of asin right.

255
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:21,709
So the last. Lasted in the previous lecture.

256
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:25,820
Three We compute the expected value of S and then the variants of S.

257
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:32,399
And so this one we want to find the distribution. The general distributors think about last time.

258
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,530
We just deal with the two moments and that is what we want.

259
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:42,630
The food distribution. No problem. So how do we do that?

260
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:46,500
And so you're first the right of the G.

261
00:36:46,990 --> 00:37:02,670
S. So if you want to do the calculation of the of the you figure out baseline the probability estimate to j let's think.

262
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:06,780
Right. So generally, if anyone.

263
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:15,310
So the problem is asking for the probability generating function that you need to figure out this term for general.

264
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:20,670
Right. So find out what is the probability of asr equal to K.

265
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:32,130
So what you can do here is using first using the actually if you're trying to figure out this, you could using the the convolution.

266
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,889
I think that also shown in the lecture notes.

267
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:43,530
But there is a really simple way to get the every single turn of the the probability mass functions through the generating function.

268
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:49,320
Okay. Because if you're going to find the general term, why not find them?

269
00:37:49,320 --> 00:38:03,990
All right. So this is defined as summation of, let's say, J or zero to infinity or probability as an equal to J to the public.

270
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:08,580
Okay. Got this.

271
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:25,210
And that usually the helpful thing is to right this one.

272
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:29,970
They expected a valuable key to the acid.

273
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:37,190
So what changes here is you are asking for, well, the problem maybe, you know,

274
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:41,910
the solution you need to do is actually calculating every single term of this.

275
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:47,010
But if you're using generating function. I'll turn that into a problem.

276
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:55,780
You only need to calculate the expectation. I teach with the accent and I wake up alone to deal with expectation.

277
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:02,110
Okay, so how do we calculate that? So he asserts.

278
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:07,270
So you're going to use this index, the node, the random variable, the target.

279
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:14,620
The random variable is what we assume.

280
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:20,890
All right. So you can actually write this t to the essence of equals.

281
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:30,200
I just want to know the summation. I put one to an X.

282
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:34,660
I think they're independent.

283
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:41,010
And then they are. But the the number of copies are not known here.

284
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:59,710
So we run into the same problem with the always that we deal with before we could just simply use apply the total expectation of t to the.

285
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:12,060
Condition of advance calculated.

286
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:20,610
So this is the target expectation we can use the either the filtration well this is a total

287
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:26,729
expectation or we can always condition more information and then integrate all of that information.

288
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:33,000
So this one, this integrate all here, there.

289
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:42,010
From here to here. Okay. So we can calculate the condition.

290
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:51,430
No expectation. They should take the mindset that if and no movement that this is a fixed number of the sums in this condition.

291
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:57,970
All you have a fixed number of the sums, the random sums, and then they're independent.

292
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:10,960
Right. So this becomes. So I'm going to write, maybe write this way.

293
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:19,870
So what is that?

294
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:35,500
So you look at this. If unless given, then that's nothing more than just, um, copies of the generating function of X multiplied together.

295
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:38,770
Right. So this one.

296
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:42,940
And complaining equals she acts.

297
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:56,620
To the power of one, right? So the song, the random sum of not like they were integer value of random variables,

298
00:41:56,620 --> 00:42:05,920
they were generating function the you know, in this in the in this form it's just g x he we have the x.

299
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:13,420
And so assuming that the F1 F1 is known that you know, this generating function as well,

300
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:20,950
the G acts to the power and that account for the the independent sums together.

301
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:33,440
Yeah. So. I'm sorry, you guys.

302
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:46,080
You can call. Or actually, we're done here.

303
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:56,460
The reason we're done is you have to recognize that this whole thing is expected.

304
00:42:57,810 --> 00:43:01,860
This expectation is nothing more than just another.

305
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:09,620
Generating function. Probability generating function. Evaluate and add this value.

306
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:15,170
And then this is the random variable. So that means this is a G.

307
00:43:15,850 --> 00:43:20,180
And so that's the F two distribution here.

308
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:29,060
Right. So that's also into and then negative integer value around the variable evaluated at what particular value?

309
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:38,440
So that's evaluate X, right?

310
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:47,210
So we call this composing function, right? So first the the first the calculation this the G acts T.

311
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:50,840
And now you get the value or you plug in the whole thing and compute the G.

312
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:57,340
And so this is a general term. So sometimes we write this as.

313
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:07,190
So this is a more like a functional operation, right? So you sequentially applied two functions.

314
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:15,050
First, the inner function, GSP, and then once you get the value, you plug into the G and the alter function.

315
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:18,740
So that's just a notation. But they are the same.

316
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:33,230
There is not a lot of calculation here, but the conceptual understanding is critical in this particular case.

317
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:40,040
So the fact the way we use is, first of all, the conditioning.

318
00:44:40,130 --> 00:44:48,830
So this is a come from the total expectation law based on the modern definition of the conditional expectation.

319
00:44:50,270 --> 00:45:04,250
Secondly, we take we all use the fact if you are if you have the finite sum of independent random variables,

320
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,720
if they are individually there are not negative integer values,

321
00:45:09,350 --> 00:45:17,960
then their generating function can be right as the generating function to the power of the number of copies.

322
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:23,899
But you can only do this one the condition after the next.

323
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:34,930
The thing is just to recognize that the last term is actually itself as the form of generating function, but evaluate it at the value g x.

324
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:41,120
Okay, so the random term is always on the power of it's looking for the total return.

325
00:45:44,210 --> 00:45:48,410
All right. Go through this yourself a few times.

326
00:45:48,410 --> 00:45:51,410
I think you should feel more comfortable about this.

327
00:45:52,130 --> 00:45:56,250
The whole argument. Okay. Yes, please.

328
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:02,820
So just to clarify what this is, is this just the generating function for a probability generating function or is this.

329
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:13,900
Okay. Good question. This is the probability generating function for us and for the random variable s and right.

330
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:17,490
Because each term I'll see is well represented.

331
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:29,430
So if you want to know what is the asset equal to zero, then you evaluate this function that t zero and you get you get your answer.

332
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:49,270
Right. Each individual. So this one, you can write some addition split restaurant chain to this, you know.

333
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:58,540
It's fancy. So we're going to see this application immediately because we have only about 30 minutes.

334
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:01,540
So we're going to talk about golden loss of process. This is us.

335
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:07,930
This actually is the case. We can use this result.

336
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:16,970
Good. Good question. Any more questions about this?

337
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:30,170
Right. So as I said, we probably need to go through and do it yourself a few times after the class to clarify every single argument I made here.

338
00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:37,450
All right. I think we have a bit of time to start the discussion.

339
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:47,180
We're not going to finish the discussion of Carlton Wilson process, but we hope to finish it on Wednesday.

340
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:50,540
All right.

341
00:47:50,900 --> 00:48:07,280
So so so far we have few the tools explicitly that the tools where we have been talking about this conditional expectation generating function.

342
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:14,960
So these two are important things for us to deal with.

343
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:24,650
Stochastic process in general. So next so we're going to talk about such a stochastic process known as.

344
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:31,700
So this is already electronic by and I'll talk about culture plus of concepts.

345
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:49,460
So this is a stochastic process. So that means it deals with the infinite number of resonant variables.

346
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:54,380
And there is a definition for this.

347
00:48:54,770 --> 00:48:57,770
I'll tell you a little bit about the background of this.

348
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:07,310
So every this is a mathematical model that will arise from first of all, from the 19th century, we think.

349
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:15,200
Francis Galton. Which is because he's a founder of modern statistics.

350
00:49:15,650 --> 00:49:19,370
I think his contribution mostly in linear regression.

351
00:49:19,950 --> 00:49:24,350
I'm not completely sure. I'm not sure what's in this.

352
00:49:25,610 --> 00:49:28,729
If you're doing to Wikipedia, it probably wasn't this.

353
00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:33,260
But Sir Francis Galton is the name I recognize.

354
00:49:33,830 --> 00:49:39,020
So the question he got interested in is he studied the surnames.

355
00:49:39,110 --> 00:49:45,230
So the Englishman is interested in the propagation of a surname.

356
00:49:45,690 --> 00:49:54,860
All right, so if you like, Smith is quite popular in the in the English population.

357
00:49:54,860 --> 00:50:04,220
So I'm curious why some surnames get populated faster and then some surnames just die out eventually.

358
00:50:05,150 --> 00:50:15,170
Right. So they started this small though, and also become relevant in Manhattan Project, actually.

359
00:50:15,590 --> 00:50:26,570
So they they are the issue of the and they have to consider is basically that the nuclear bomb is just a bunch of nuclear.

360
00:50:26,630 --> 00:50:33,890
It's a chain reaction we all know as a nuclear fission. But you need some energy to trigger the nuclear fission.

361
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:39,610
Why does this trigger that? And then the nuclear fission is like a chain, right?

362
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:45,830
So the first the neutron hits the the atom and then the atom split into two.

363
00:50:46,370 --> 00:50:59,060
And then if you keep big and keep doing this and they keep doing this to doing the split like the neutron and I actually should talk about this.

364
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:08,960
I'm not qualified to teach this. But the thing about this is they need that initial energy to the introduce.

365
00:51:08,970 --> 00:51:14,090
They need to calculate the initial energy to trigger this type of chain reaction.

366
00:51:14,330 --> 00:51:24,830
Right. The energy is defined as you need a proportion of the initial energy introduced into the system should be sustained.

367
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:28,700
So this is a pretty much like a surname thing. Right.

368
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:38,480
So this is like a tweak and a span. It's a nuclear fission, get more and more and then eventually it's out of control, become a nuclear bomb.

369
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:45,790
But you don't want something. You give a initial energy, not large enough, not just die out.

370
00:51:46,310 --> 00:51:53,990
Right? Basically a die. So they they were studying this type of thing.

371
00:51:53,990 --> 00:51:57,290
And then they think about this.

372
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:02,870
This is also a application of the Galton Watson process.

373
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:11,509
So this is also known as a branching process from the surname.

374
00:52:11,510 --> 00:52:18,940
And then this you can imagine the type of the model they're dealing with here.

375
00:52:18,950 --> 00:52:23,550
I'm giving you the formal definition of that. Yeah.

376
00:52:24,410 --> 00:52:27,440
Why this application this round?

377
00:52:29,690 --> 00:52:37,570
So we're going to deal with a random variable or the. A Clear Channel runs a variable or stochastic process.

378
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:42,610
So this is the stochastic process. So we're going to deal with it's called a Z.

379
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:51,790
Right. It's going to be an infinite sequence of random variable Z with offspring distribution.

380
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:57,160
We're going to have offspring distribution, so called offspring distribution.

381
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:08,200
So for the in the nuclear bomb example, this is the, you know,

382
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:18,969
the energy introduce that initially generated how many nuclear fission reactions and therefore the surname

383
00:53:18,970 --> 00:53:26,610
is probably consider the first generation of Smith how many offspring he had possibly his surname.

384
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:36,759
All right. So those those are the so-called offspring of distribution as opposed to the K, right?

385
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:46,180
So maybe the first the Mr. Smith has zero offspring, so that's the probability P zero for one offspring.

386
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:52,090
Kerry Smith is the surname, that's P one and then two, three, so on and so forth.

387
00:53:52,660 --> 00:54:00,040
Right. So okay equal to zero. I'm sorry.

388
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:11,110
Go to infinity. So this one is a so this one is a discrete time.

389
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:15,580
This tell you the nature of the state space.

390
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:22,390
So all these are these are actually not negative integers out of a random variable just like we.

391
00:54:22,690 --> 00:54:31,270
So this is basically discuss the number of offsprings every z here is the number of offsprings in the 11th generation.

392
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:49,110
So these three pi. Sorry. Mark Nejame, we haven't talked about Mark Twain yet, but that's a formal definition that use this is not important.

393
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:54,320
I'll tell you the mark of property in this context in the plot.

394
00:54:54,450 --> 00:54:59,460
So this is the space. Space. Definition such that.

395
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:12,989
So we're thinking about plus one a generation.

396
00:55:12,990 --> 00:55:22,260
So the number of so that plus one generation of Smith How many of those are Smith

397
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:31,410
in plus one generation conditional on the current generation that's in Z of NPR.

398
00:55:33,270 --> 00:55:51,530
So we cannot define this as a convolution. If there is among those then this the ZM plus one and convolution.

399
00:56:00,650 --> 00:56:19,480
Of the offspring distribution. Right. So the other way to write it.

400
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:24,710
That's why I use the common sense. So this is a basic use for definition.

401
00:56:24,730 --> 00:56:28,030
The other way to think about this, it's actually quite simple.

402
00:56:45,730 --> 00:56:55,000
What does it mean? Is it simply the fact if you want to calculate zero plus one, it's going to be a random variable.

403
00:56:55,810 --> 00:57:02,400
And then given the previous generation, you'll have a Z and right.

404
00:57:02,410 --> 00:57:07,000
So the Z here is a random variable, that's the previous generation.

405
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:16,180
So that's basically if the parents number of the parents year and each of the parents each of the Smith

406
00:57:16,930 --> 00:57:28,420
going to independently generate X and Y offsprings right so this excellent I'll springs follows.

407
00:57:28,810 --> 00:57:37,600
I mean that's the the that's the offspring distribution we talked about there.

408
00:57:38,110 --> 00:57:48,910
So we're often calling it this is a very easy two and then we always have to see the zero generation always defined as one.

409
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:57,010
So what happens is the first generation say the oldest method of is a single person.

410
00:57:58,420 --> 00:58:05,710
So this is a generation and equal to zero. So he cannot produce a random number of offsprings.

411
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:14,470
Right. Let's draw this according to, let's say, the three.

412
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:19,750
So this one equals three. But that's actually a draw from that distribution.

413
00:58:20,650 --> 00:58:29,860
I think in this case, the probability to get a three offspring is p393.

414
00:58:32,950 --> 00:58:39,370
All right. So that's the first. The two, the three. So this one demonstrate what is the offspring distribution, right?

415
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:45,700
So you have a single parent and they generate three random number of offspring.

416
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:52,030
So that's the offspring distribution. The rest of these are just follow the same rule.

417
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:56,350
So this is an equal to one. So what about unequal to two?

418
00:58:56,410 --> 00:59:00,910
So for the two, you just need to iterate over these individuals.

419
00:59:00,910 --> 00:59:04,840
In the previous generation, that's where the convolution come from.

420
00:59:05,230 --> 00:59:12,640
And are you independently second of all from the offspring distribution online gate.

421
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:16,720
So for example, the first one generate two individuals,

422
00:59:17,350 --> 00:59:27,430
the second one may be generated one individual and if the third one doesn't generate any individual and the offspring, you know that this is zero.

423
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:35,200
So this branch could stay out, right? So I think you could do three, you could do the same thing.

424
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:41,560
So you have these all of these offspring that's out there, it's called the second generation.

425
00:59:42,190 --> 00:59:48,580
Maybe the first one generates for the second one generate.

426
00:59:49,070 --> 00:59:52,630
Does it generate any the first one, the third one, generate two.

427
00:59:53,890 --> 01:00:00,620
So you can imagine. So all of these things. Follow this rule and then go out.

428
01:00:03,470 --> 01:00:06,540
So, so how we define this.

429
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:15,530
So the Z zero integer is basically the number of individuals in the first generation an equal to zero.

430
01:00:15,890 --> 01:00:26,290
Z one you common number of individuals three and c two, three, three.

431
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:30,530
One, two, three, four, five, six. So.

432
01:00:30,830 --> 01:00:46,010
So this is a realization of sutra, which is a realization of the call of Watson process with the general rule of offspring distribution.

433
01:00:49,190 --> 01:00:53,630
So the important thing is this is says this is a markov chain.

434
01:00:54,140 --> 01:01:02,990
It simply means the plus one's generation, the population size or the Z and plus one.

435
01:01:04,310 --> 01:01:09,790
It's only determined by Z and right.

436
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:22,310
So if you given me Z and then Z plus one that is independent with C and minus one, Z and minus two, so on, so forth, they become independent.

437
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:24,400
That's pretty obvious, right?

438
01:01:24,410 --> 01:01:35,030
So the information y you're trying to calculate and plus one, you only need two conditional or in other words, the only thing to know immediate.

439
01:01:35,270 --> 01:01:38,750
Previous generations, population size.

440
01:01:40,070 --> 01:01:49,610
So that's basically the Markov property. Now, we're going to talk about that for more details in in about one or two weeks.

441
01:01:52,100 --> 01:01:59,960
The other thing is to realize, oh, these things are just simply trying to formalize this illustration.

442
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:05,070
Right either the convolution, if you feel comfortable about that, that's fine.

443
01:02:05,580 --> 01:02:09,120
And then this one is that using the completely random variable, right?

444
01:02:09,790 --> 01:02:21,180
This is I acknowledge the fact if you're conditional on Z, then you just add up all of these all spring distributions,

445
01:02:21,740 --> 01:02:29,860
the, you know, the the real, the accent I those are from the offspring distribution.

446
01:02:30,330 --> 01:02:33,660
But the number of. Yeah.

447
01:02:35,490 --> 01:02:40,890
The, uh, the nose you're going to have depends on CNN here.

448
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:48,500
Right. So. So this representation is equivalent to the.

449
01:02:48,510 --> 01:02:55,270
The previous. This to this representation.

450
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:59,129
This is a convolution as well because I think the Z and the.

451
01:02:59,130 --> 01:03:04,780
You could sit here, right? Okay.

452
01:03:04,940 --> 01:03:14,690
So that's the definition. That's how you define Colton wasn't the process and then so you see this is if you look at the per generation,

453
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:17,930
this will look just like a compound random variable problem.

454
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:29,290
I need to add up the offsprings, but the number to add up to itself is a random variable c and so.

455
01:03:31,330 --> 01:03:38,430
It's. Okay.

456
01:03:38,430 --> 01:03:45,630
So the other notational thing is you need to consider there is a dying out

457
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:54,930
situation if three from a certain generation if zero zero was going to happen.

458
01:03:55,560 --> 01:04:05,430
So that means implies this implies Z and plus one to the other, plus to all the rest equal to zero.

459
01:04:06,090 --> 01:04:11,640
Right? Thus means extinction of a family name.

460
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:15,510
The extinction of the family but the extinction of the family name.

461
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:24,840
It's important to have this definition because we're dealing with infinite collection of random variables.

462
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:32,770
There's not saying the. All of are that you have a finite you have a finite, non-zero random variables.

463
01:04:32,770 --> 01:04:36,700
But right now, those are all zero. So this is called extinction.

464
01:04:37,330 --> 01:04:41,920
So why does it enter into the extinction state from certain generation?

465
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:48,100
Like only because of zero. So this this so called a mark of change will stay there.

466
01:04:48,850 --> 01:04:52,390
And in Markov chain terminology, this is the absorbing state.

467
01:04:52,570 --> 01:04:56,890
Once you get into this always probability y you always stay there.

468
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:03,940
So this is another terminology we can to. So more generally, we right.

469
01:05:04,060 --> 01:05:11,950
0040 and we are equal to one.

470
01:05:17,170 --> 01:05:20,200
So that means a zero is absorbing state.

471
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:28,050
All right. So this is a description of the process.

472
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:32,399
Now, a few things we need to sort out when we study stochastic process.

473
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:44,070
The first thing we want to do is we want really figure out the, you know, the recursive structure here and maybe the generating function of it is.

474
01:05:46,230 --> 01:05:52,200
All we're interested to figure out what are the properties of individual random variables?

475
01:05:52,260 --> 01:06:03,940
As a member of this casting process, it's about the process.

476
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:10,930
It's about a lot of. There is a collection of random parables.

477
01:06:11,230 --> 01:06:15,460
But can we say something about marginal distribution of certain random variable?

478
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:20,709
Right. So for example, what about the probability Z?

479
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:28,240
And it's false. I say equals without knowing.

480
01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:35,130
So the question. The question number one. So we call this generating function.

481
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:38,560
Right. So we try to figure out the probability mass function.

482
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:43,580
No. The Z end is defined through a stochastic process.

483
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:47,440
But the question itself is ask the individual random variables.

484
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:53,410
Property. Yep. What is the probability mass function for this and z and equal to AB.

485
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:58,690
And in some way this is a pretty simple if only equal to zero.

486
01:06:58,690 --> 01:07:08,920
We already know that. Because probability is zero equals one, it's one.

487
01:07:10,430 --> 01:07:14,270
It's one because we always define zero equal to one.

488
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:25,190
And if you think about the probability you see one, you call it two, and this equals one.

489
01:07:28,270 --> 01:07:32,830
We don't. But we have a notation for this. This is the this is a PM.

490
01:07:34,510 --> 01:07:38,320
Right. So this is the from the offspring distribution.

491
01:07:38,890 --> 01:07:44,650
So we already know Z zero, z one. Before general representation Z.

492
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:51,250
We don't have this sort of the formula, but you could see it.

493
01:07:51,490 --> 01:07:57,100
You could work from Z one to Z to the Z three for Z four sequentially.

494
01:07:57,400 --> 01:08:01,850
And then you can figure out what is the four Z and four and three.

495
01:08:01,930 --> 01:08:05,770
There isn't one. Right. But this should be clear marginally.

496
01:08:06,370 --> 01:08:09,370
The first one is fix the Z.

497
01:08:09,370 --> 01:08:14,980
Zero is fake z always one. The first generation falls offspring distribution.

498
01:08:15,670 --> 01:08:27,470
Then the question is actually ask you four and you know, later generations, how do we deal with this sort of.

499
01:08:28,420 --> 01:08:36,490
So we can just calculate the disease probability generation function.

500
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:41,890
I think we have we just need to finish this. And now we call it the 30 for today.

501
01:08:42,550 --> 01:08:45,810
So what about G and that's. So each other off.

502
01:08:45,850 --> 01:08:55,150
If you are dealing with the problem of finding probability mass function like this, you could always think about probability and function.

503
01:08:55,210 --> 01:09:09,220
I say this is CNN. And then for the sake of shorthand notation, I just called is this just say let's see here.

504
01:09:09,700 --> 01:09:16,060
G And that's okay. This one equals probability.

505
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:22,780
K zero and the infinity say p.

506
01:09:32,510 --> 01:09:38,880
Okay. As. This is a defamation bill.

507
01:09:39,690 --> 01:09:45,470
As to nothing added here.

508
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:48,840
This is just the definition of probability generated function.

509
01:09:50,850 --> 01:09:54,950
And then how do we calculate this? That's the issue on.

510
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:03,400
Put this up here. I need the treatment here.

511
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:23,590
You know, you consider a general and here so G and S by definition, as I say, too busy.

512
01:10:24,580 --> 01:10:28,330
All right. So that's the generation. I say this right here.

513
01:10:29,110 --> 01:10:35,440
Okay. But look at this branching process or the call to blossom process.

514
01:10:35,860 --> 01:10:40,730
How can we calculate that in a general term for CNS or the generation?

515
01:10:40,750 --> 01:10:43,900
Here you have to condition on something.

516
01:10:44,410 --> 01:10:48,260
As we said, you cannot do the enumeration.

517
01:10:48,910 --> 01:10:53,080
And then the very natural thing to do is actually conditional on Z one.

518
01:10:55,120 --> 01:11:06,640
There is a some benefit of doing that, right? So let's do that because the total excitation law would always tell us conditional anything.

519
01:11:07,450 --> 01:11:15,130
And that's very true. All right.

520
01:11:15,430 --> 01:11:20,380
So how does that help? So now you know Z one.

521
01:11:21,190 --> 01:11:28,209
All right. So if you want to calculate the Z earned from Z one, then you need to disconnect the this in the right.

522
01:11:28,210 --> 01:11:35,480
Just looking down up. So in this realization, all of sudden you have how many trees?

523
01:11:35,540 --> 01:11:38,930
So this one is one this is a one single tree.

524
01:11:38,990 --> 01:11:44,960
Right. If you're conditional on Z one, it's like you got it right here.

525
01:11:45,150 --> 01:11:49,550
Now you get three different trees because the first generation has three.

526
01:11:49,910 --> 01:11:55,820
And then more generally, if you're conditioned on Z one, you're going to get Z one number of trees,

527
01:11:56,090 --> 01:12:01,520
and then each tree is behave the same as the whole tree.

528
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:10,850
Right? So they're going to produce the next offspring, just like the first tree.

529
01:12:11,060 --> 01:12:19,060
And then they they got to do that recursively, except now your target becomes three parts.

530
01:12:19,070 --> 01:12:27,440
You need to add up this Z one different trees together to come to an end.

531
01:12:27,530 --> 01:12:39,320
Right. And the other thing is, if you come from the first generation, this is a one and then the the target become a minus one generation.

532
01:12:40,310 --> 01:12:51,920
Yeah. Only these if you if you put all of these together, if your nosey that you want that you know busy social and trying to say you are doing.

533
01:13:07,950 --> 01:13:18,710
So I'm going to write the key and minus one because each of this tree you are calculating Z and minus one.

534
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:29,270
Right from here. Look at the first tree. The first node, you get a minus one generations, two toward the bottom.

535
01:13:29,450 --> 01:13:34,190
Right. And then you add up this part, the Z and minus one.

536
01:13:34,580 --> 01:13:39,590
So I this part of the Z and minus one. You add up this part of the Z and minus one.

537
01:13:40,010 --> 01:13:44,880
How many copies you add it up? Z UN colleagues.

538
01:13:44,890 --> 01:13:51,040
So again. So each call, he adds, if you calculate, go back to the s minus one.

539
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:56,320
So each of these are so G and minus one. S And how many copies?

540
01:13:56,950 --> 01:14:00,580
C one. Oh, yeah.

541
01:14:02,110 --> 01:14:07,660
So again, you need to go back to the compound random variable from the previous chapter.

542
01:14:07,780 --> 01:14:11,470
And I feel comfortable about this.

543
01:14:12,310 --> 01:14:16,420
Okay. But this one, you can simply write.

544
01:14:16,540 --> 01:14:23,740
So this is expected the value. This one is a value to the power of Z one.

545
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:34,780
Right. So I can write this sg1, g minus one s right.

546
01:14:34,780 --> 01:14:39,760
So now we decompose the glass into g one XI and minus one.

547
01:14:42,190 --> 01:14:49,060
This is a decomposition. It turns out that you could decompose this more arbitrarily.

548
01:14:49,990 --> 01:14:52,990
And we're going to talk about this next time.

549
01:14:53,470 --> 01:14:59,320
Okay. But when you get back, you need to, you know,

550
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:08,350
make yourself comfortable about writing this slide into this one to understand the logic from base to there's a notice to this.

551
01:15:08,770 --> 01:15:15,400
And then on Wednesday, we're going to talk more about this and then talk about extinction probability.

552
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:18,760
Okay, everybody, on Wednesday.
