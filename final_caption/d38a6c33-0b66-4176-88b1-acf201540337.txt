1
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:09,540
So you've heard about the ACCESS model. But I wanted to talk a little bit more about what it looks like

2
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:15,890
when it comes to actual things being done in the community. This just kind of shows you a visual of the,

3
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:23,030
you know, all of the breath of things that we do just at our Community Health and Resource Center.

4
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:28,860
And I wanted to kind of show you what we did last year, it what we did in 2019.

5
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:33,270
So this kind of is a snapshot of all the things we've accomplished.

6
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:38,580
And you'll see that there's a ton of things that take one of these is hidden back here.

7
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:44,820
But, you know, we have integrated arts with our health program.

8
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:55,650
We have done a lot of crisis intervention. We've even done a sexual assault prevention trainings with judges and court and law enforcement

9
00:00:55,650 --> 00:01:00,360
because so that they can be aware of the fact that sometimes when somebody is coming in,

10
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:07,360
for example, for a divorce, that they should also be getting an Islamic divorce through the Islamic law.

11
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:15,840
We have done, you know, our hope house that I talked about in my last section has grown immensely and reached national accreditation.

12
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:26,210
We work with youth in schools. We even have therapists in schools now that provide, you know, that can be there on site, as you know, kids coming in.

13
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:32,370
And one of the things that we noticed is that kids school performances have such a strong link with mental health.

14
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:39,490
And that's why we wanted to have therapists on site at the schools.

15
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:45,700
But then things changed last year and we really had to, you know,

16
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:54,160
stop everything and try to figure out what we can do and what is our role in this pandemic.

17
00:01:54,160 --> 00:02:00,870
I'll tell you a little bit of what happened to our community and our programing during this time.

18
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:10,240
So during the time of the pandemic, we had approximately a 30 percent increase in demand for domestic violence services,

19
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,480
40 percent for mental health services.

20
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:21,000
And as we are all aware of what went on in this country, the the demand for unemployment services went through the roof.

21
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,120
And for domestic violence and mental health,

22
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:31,440
this is only scratching the surface because there are so many people who are in crisis mode right now that are just trying to survive,

23
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,860
that have not even started to unpack what's going on in their lives.

24
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:39,210
So, our you know,

25
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:46,110
our assumption is that probably in this year we would see an even greater growth in domestic violence and mental health services.

26
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:52,650
I remember the first I think it was the second week of the shutdown in Michigan.

27
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:57,000
I came into the office and, you know, it was all dark and gloomy.

28
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,300
And I don't know if you've been to any public spaces and thing since they shut down.

29
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:05,580
It's really, you know, disconcerting and weird to walk into those spaces.

30
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:12,420
But my the front desk phone was ringing and I decided to pick it up.

31
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:18,390
And it was a woman, she was screaming and she was crying and she said, please save me, please save me.

32
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:26,070
I don't know where to go. I slept in my car last night because my partner tried to kill me.

33
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:30,960
He tried to take exercise weight and smashed my head with it.

34
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:38,990
And I don't know where to go because everything's shut down. So it's not that domestic violence cases disappeared.

35
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:45,820
They actually have have, you know, really become a lot worse in this time.

36
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:54,780
And that's why it was really important for us to reimagine our services and make sure that anybody who needs it has access to shelter,

37
00:03:54,780 --> 00:04:01,300
case management, and mental health during this time. So.

38
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:06,700
So we, you know, immediately began our telehealth services.

39
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:10,450
But to be honest with you, those didn't last very long.

40
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,980
Especially for our clinic.

41
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:21,160
Our clinic started had to start seeing patients because of the large digital gap that exists in our community and also connectivity.

42
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:28,780
You know, not everybody has the tools and software to be to have a stable Internet connection.

43
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:33,970
So we had to actually open up our clinic a thing within a month of the shutdown.

44
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:41,590
Another thing we started doing while during the pandemic was we started doing weekly

45
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:46,900
we were actually doing daily covid testing, which as the number started to stabilize

46
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:54,610
It switched to weekly testing. And basically it was a drive thru. I have some pictures of it here on the slide.

47
00:04:54,610 --> 00:05:00,400
People would come in and at the intake process, we end up asking them the same questions.

48
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:06,580
We ask that, you know, clients like that patient I was talking about who came in with a flu or a fever.

49
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:12,800
We asked them about all of the other social needs that we can fulfill. And as we started gathering this data,

50
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:19,780
we we realized that we need to expand the amount of services that we do provide through a drive thru testing.

51
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:26,470
The other thing that we did at drive thru testing is we actually took staff members that work in different

52
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:33,130
public health and prevention programs and we trained them to be the in takers at the testing sites.

53
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:38,530
So these testing sites were done in partnership between Wayne State University and Wayne State University,

54
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:44,710
did the actual swabbing and provided the medical aspect of it.

55
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:48,600
But we did the intake and the coordination.

56
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:58,640
So, you know, and there's so many stories that came out of that, which I'll touch on a couple if we have time once we've gone through this.

57
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:03,550
A lot of the other thing we did as the covid shutdown began is we started talking

58
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:09,250
to all of our case managers and compiling a list of our most vulnerable clients.

59
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,000
So at ACCESS

60
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:20,500
We already have an extensive assessment that we do that basically looks at all the needs of a client and then what are their most urgent needs.

61
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:28,300
So we started doing this assessment with all of the wonderful clients that were established in one joint list.

62
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:38,980
And then our caseworkers ended up doing, you know, dropping off groceries and, you know, helping people enroll in unemployment or whatever it may be.

63
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:43,750
And wherever it may be, some people met at the porch outside their house.

64
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:48,220
Some people did, you know, connected with us by phone or facetime.

65
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:52,600
You know, some people came to our parking lot and we talked to them at a distance.

66
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:59,720
So, you know, we we did what it took to be able to provide crisis management to the most vulnerable clients.

67
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:08,770
And than the other thing that was really important and continues to be important is that we did we provide education on how to you know,

68
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:19,990
how to be safe during this time. And it's it's really relevant to this day because communities of color have a high level of vaccine hesitancy.

69
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:28,180
So we are using that same model of community education through our caseworkers, through town halls, regular webinars,

70
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:38,080
as well as, you know, specific WhatsApp and social media groups to continue the education around safety and prevention.

71
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,380
And then, you know, it's this I just kind of threw it in there.

72
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:48,790
You know, within the first couple of months, we distributed food to a 1200 families with food boxes.

73
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:56,290
And so every year for our domestic violence program, we actually have a dinner, a banquet that raises funds.

74
00:07:56,290 --> 00:08:05,500
And most of the time, you know, we'll raise like fifty thousand max. But this year we did a virtual campaign, which we've never done before.

75
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:17,220
And we were able to raise a $100,000. And this money essentially has been going to families that need shelter, housing, food, clothes,

76
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:25,870
you know, basic health care, whatever it may be that are trying to escape from abusive relationships.

77
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,670
So here's a little summary.

78
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:36,730
I'll move myself a little bit so you can see here's a little summary of the things that we've done from April 2020 to present.

79
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:41,590
We did not collect data before this. We were we were in survival mode for the month of March.

80
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:52,370
So in April, we started collecting data. So you'll see that we've we serve meals, we've done you know, we provided a link people to health coverage,

81
00:08:52,370 --> 00:09:05,030
a lot of people lost their jobs during the pandemic and had employer provided, you know, employers sponsored health coverage forever

82
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:08,690
so they never had to use the marketplace to get health enrollment or use Medicaid.

83
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:21,560
So we help those folks, you know, provided mental health and physical health, telehealth services, you know, domestic violence and then tests.

84
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:30,110
And then also emergency services like somebodies water shut off or somebody is getting evicted or, you know, need shelter.

85
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:34,030
That was extremely important. And then the last virus for public benefits.

86
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:42,150
So that would include food stamps, you know, unemployment, those kind of services.

87
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:48,730
Wanted to show you, you know, a lot of people worry about what happens with medical clinics,

88
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:54,160
but actually we had a pretty big surge in the medical clinic in 2020.

89
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:59,200
And I think it's because we chose to remain open, unlike a lot of other medical clinics.

90
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:08,200
And, you know, it's really important because we were able to see that, you know, 40 percent of our patients had a BMI greater than 25.

91
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:17,590
You know, 15 percent of the patients seen in the last six months had high depression scale scores.

92
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:21,070
So, you know, they were linked to mental health services.

93
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:30,520
And then hypertension, you know, diabetes, other different chronic diseases factors were fairly high in the clients as well.

94
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:34,930
So it's really important to, you know, do the crisis management for the clients,

95
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:40,840
but also linked them to services, you know, as as they came into the clinic.

96
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:51,250
So, you know, one thing that I really liked was that having a drive through testing site helped us open

97
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:58,760
our services to a lot of people that wouldn't maybe normally never seek services.

98
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:04,600
You know, we had that a lot of people that normally won't walk into our clinic because they don't they

99
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:10,370
are not documented or they don't have they're in the middle of their immigration process.

100
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:15,550
A lot of people in our community stop seeking care because of things like public charge.

101
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:29,140
Public charge is a you know, is a basically is a law that says that if you have if you're coming to this country and getting sponsored to be here,

102
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:36,040
that you should not you're the amount of public benefits that you use, including Medicaid,

103
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:41,320
will be looked at in order to determine that you can have a green card or not.

104
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:45,250
So it was very misinterpreted and there was a big chilling effect.

105
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:55,300
And a lot of people that don't even that aren't even, you know, part of the public charge were it disenrolled from care because of it.

106
00:11:55,300 --> 00:12:01,350
So and a lot of these people are ones that they saw free testing, no restrictions.

107
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:08,980
So they actually drove through our drive through and we were able to do the other assessments for him, for them. In particular

108
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:19,210
we had one lady, she had a special needs child, and she herself was having some issues with her breast.

109
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:25,670
And she ended up coming through to the drive through testing site because she heard that there they don't look at,

110
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:30,760
you know, immigration or didn't look at health insurance and she was uninsured.

111
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:38,560
So she came in and it just so happened that that day the person doing intake was a somebody from our cancer prevention program.

112
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,150
So as they were talking, she said, hey, you know, I have this issue. I think it's like a lump in my breast.

113
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:48,190
And she said, why don't you come in? Let me just do a check. You don't need insurance.

114
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:55,300
And we don't we will not look at your visa status. She was worried because her husband

115
00:12:55,300 --> 00:13:02,650
when the husband found out that they had a special needs child, he left and he didn't he he didn't show up to her green card interview.

116
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:09,040
So her paperwork was in limbo. And that's why she didn't have health coverage or a stable status in the US.

117
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:15,820
She came in, got detected for cancer and ended up getting linked to services for free,

118
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:20,260
which would have never happened if she had not come through the testing site.

119
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:27,910
Her son, who is a special needs child, got linked to our home visiting mental health services for children,

120
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:30,760
which would have never happened if she hadn't come to that testing site.

121
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:37,890
So there was a lot of value in creating this mobile medicine that exists today.

122
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:43,190
But one thing that I want to talk about is, you know what

123
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:48,630
you know what even in the pandemic that we've seen is a big limitation.

124
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:58,920
So we provide a lot of services, but it's very, very hard for organizations that serve the Arab community to be able to get the appropriate resources.

125
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:05,550
And that's because, as in the census, there is no category for Middle East,

126
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:09,230
North African communities, which is something I mentioned in the first section of my presentation.

127
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:19,320
So here's a here's what the census form looks like. And you'll see, you know, if you were Arab-American, you don't really know where you fit in.

128
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:26,560
Right. And then this kind of work also gets reflected in covid data.

129
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:31,180
So this I just this is from a actually this is from a few weeks ago.

130
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:36,870
But, you know, back when there was still a high number of cases of covid.

131
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:42,610
You know, I'm part of the Wayne County, which is the local county here, Task Force for covid Response.

132
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:50,890
And 48126 is our zip code where our main offices, our health center is.

133
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:57,310
And in that area, there was a if you look at the ethnicity breakdown,

134
00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:05,410
even though they did Arab ethnicity work and Arab ethnicity data, that is still a lot of discrepancy.

135
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:10,870
48126 is a region that I would say majority of the residents are Arab-American.

136
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:20,070
But if you look at the ethnicity data, it says that 33 percent of the people who were positive were Arab, but that this 22 percent that are non Arab.

137
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:23,230
These are people probably for real that are not Arab, but then

138
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:33,460
45 percent are unknown. So this these people will never be counted amongst the list of people that are covid positive.

139
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:41,800
So we will not get resources to assist this community in an appropriate way because there's not enough data.

140
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:48,280
And the funny thing is that the county even started doing contact tracing.

141
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:52,760
They realized that a lot of these houses they were calling, they speak only Arabic.

142
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:58,540
So this number changed dramatically as this data got updated by the county,

143
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:05,920
because there were in fact almost all of this 45 percent, they were Arab-American.

144
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:11,800
So this is actually, you know, a big issue for our community.

145
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:17,830
So we provide the services, we provide the empowerment and the integrated services.

146
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:23,650
But it's also important for us to have the resources to continue to provide them and without the data.

147
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:35,990
We have a very hard time doing so. So what we've done is we you know, we want we have combined this, our research and advocacy programs,

148
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:46,820
and we really are trying to make sure that we can collect data on Arab Americans and use it to advocate for our community.

149
00:16:46,820 --> 00:17:00,570
And then also in the community empower more people to be part of data collection because a lot of people because of racism and, you know, systemic,

150
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:09,960
systemic racism and, you know, discrimination against immigrants, especially Muslim populations and years and years of oppression.

151
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:18,450
A lot of people in the community don't want to indicate they're Arab-American in databases because they don't want to be considered

152
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:20,400
they don't want to be discriminated against in services.

153
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:25,290
We've actually had it happen in some of our navigator programs of people coming for health enrollment

154
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:32,010
and you ask them for their race ethnicity and they say just put white because I want to get my health coverage fast.

155
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:37,410
So we're trying to change that because we want to create not just have programing

156
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:42,150
that helps empower the community and get them out of a circle of poverty,

157
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:49,620
but also create a national narrative for this community so that our voices heard.

158
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:55,620
So that concludes my presentations,

159
00:17:55,620 --> 00:18:08,370
and I hope that this was helpful and I will be sharing some resources and a version of this presentation with you.

160
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:13,280
So if you have any questions, feel free to reach out. Thank you.
