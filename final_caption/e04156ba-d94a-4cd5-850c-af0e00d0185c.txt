1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:06,290
The priority. People don't like to change the rules.

2
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:15,700
Right. Right. I mean. I don't know if you guys are.

3
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:23,320
Like in business, whether that's to be more free.

4
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:27,850
I'm a fair weather person. I guess I don't know.

5
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:31,450
I am super. I do see people like, you know, and it's like, I see.

6
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:39,129
And I just that makes me so nervous. It's like I want to be slippin around, you know?

7
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:39,860
That's interesting.

8
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:48,399
But is it a big speaks to I'm just trying to picture there is it like a they're an existing building that they to claim is going to be,

9
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:55,440
if you like, go to my daughter's high school right around here.

10
00:00:55,510 --> 00:01:00,290
And so, like, this is. Then there's my house.

11
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:12,870
Yeah, I was going to say. I know.

12
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:22,550
President. Yeah.

13
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:35,329
Interesting, huh? Citizen four Then there was a lot of drama with the next proposal.

14
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:41,420
And I was. And. The Greens.

15
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,750
So that was perfect. Yeah, I know there has been.

16
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:52,420
I don't know if it's for one, but there's one that's perfect. People like this.

17
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:58,760
And people people are like. I don't know.

18
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:12,670
So that was my. MODERATOR Okay, so how is this going to sleep?

19
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:22,610
Feels like it's sort of like things are increasing, stuff that we've been.

20
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:29,989
But I thought, Oh yeah, I was going to say I got everybody feedback.

21
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:34,340
I just ended up giving feedback and canvas finally because you guys were all in great shape.

22
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:41,300
But I had a few thoughts on CVS that I don't think I wrote down, but everybody probably do.

23
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:53,510
You could all probably add that work in. I mean, once you get it to your CV and then kind of related to that and I can't remember exactly now,

24
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:58,430
but I think it's figure out whether you want your home address type.

25
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:06,590
Like how much information you want out there because you may be asked to extend it somewhere or, you know, eventually posted something.

26
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:10,799
And so you want to think about what went on there.

27
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:16,420
And I can't remember if anybody had that. The work that I need to present.

28
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:21,680
It just is totally unique to you and it just follow us on Twitter.

29
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:28,490
I really feel like I have my like just yeah, I've been a better person.

30
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:35,500
I mean, I have an email address that I just kind of.

31
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:50,960
One thing on that. And again, this is a tricky detail, but the five sketches in any publications that you list.

32
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:56,069
Can't do that. I can't remember if I. Everybody.

33
00:03:56,070 --> 00:04:00,360
Stephanie publication USA should have a PNC.

34
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:06,060
I've never met by the age. Library system.

35
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:12,209
And so if I do have a conversation that's not an age, and at the same time that I find it like right there,

36
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:21,240
so nobody ever gets over what can be a little tricky.

37
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:25,530
Is that one of the best experiences that when you submit a paper.

38
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:32,360
You get what? And I remember.

39
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:38,520
Which is sort of sense like this paper. With and see.

40
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,980
I seniority heard that this paper has been to.

41
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,030
And that's if they want to see some of the wait.

42
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:54,850
In fact, PNC had never actually talked about right away somebody based on like responsible for tracking down that would be kind of a hassle.

43
00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:03,280
It relies on like the first author to go in. Dominated by Michael Schumacher.

44
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:10,330
Peter. There's just like these little small details that get a little bit of a rabbit hole that I.

45
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:22,340
Paying it forward to your future self kind of thing. Like no fiancee.

46
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:26,760
I've never. Funding. Is it better to lose the.

47
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:30,910
Five years is appropriate. I think you could with the PMP experience.

48
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:39,700
If it's in if it's like publicly available, it's like a little bit because there's no requirement to appear.

49
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:44,300
Like I was just doing announcements last night and I needed some extra space.

50
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:49,040
So I took on the PMI number when I had a PMC number.

51
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:55,340
And actually I think I went ahead and took off the PMI, the number I had in mind that I.

52
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:12,240
But I don't know. There's literally. Between 100 healthy patients and when that was extended to the journal published.

53
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,360
How? And.

54
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:25,830
I think what I do is as soon as I get the emails and it's accepted, I switch it on my CV.

55
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:33,590
I think what accepted? What then sometimes happens is that they don't look back for a while at it.

56
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:39,989
And then I have like some things on my CV for next year that's May well in the future and I guarantee it'll be like,

57
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:45,870
Oh, I have those papers and have a track down, or have asked them how to track down what their official citation is.

58
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:52,180
With All I have is the title of the paper accepted. So I think once it's accepted like a new.

59
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:57,880
Sometimes there's even greater space where they say, Oh, we're going to accept these people and just make people.

60
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:04,370
At that point, I wouldn't get accepted. I would like wait to send in the revisions and then I think we're going to move.

61
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:11,580
That I was not accepted. And the difference between like the accepted and the rest.

62
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:18,330
Impressive technically means that you can find it somewhere.

63
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,870
Possibly, but some journalistic longer than others might get there.

64
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:34,020
There. Information to help prepare. So anyway, for personal use, I would say, except it has remained the same.

65
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:48,770
Interchangeably. If someone really wants to find that article, the key, they have time for us and the online number.

66
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:53,059
Because that. Digital.

67
00:07:53,060 --> 00:08:00,610
Digital? I've just been hired. That'll pop up as soon as you have an advanced patient.

68
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:08,740
And then that would be that would be like Bitcoin. The fans have friends and friends who like what is different.

69
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:15,500
This is to be a lot of things and a it so it's all it's like there's this process and some.

70
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:22,640
Immediately available and. Sometimes that has to do with an accent.

71
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:27,220
Sometimes that's have to. All of the internal.

72
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:34,170
Pediatrics, people like pop rap, and it's like they'll find a way.

73
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:40,060
The one thing I would also just triple check on your guys.

74
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:44,270
CVS. I don't have a. Just paper in the last.

75
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:51,380
Deeply ensconced in some of the title seems a little bit like the responsibility of the politician saying,

76
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,920
You know what, our children are preschoolers.

77
00:08:54,920 --> 00:09:03,940
And so that but then I have people floating around. And so if that happens and try to get in the habit of like checking with, like he said online,

78
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:17,599
the fact that this time there is a search me I only did this paper and then slightly different title a months or so,

79
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,710
but that I feel like title changes do happen a fair bit in terms of in response.

80
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:34,780
What do you think about. Oh, that is a pretty preview.

81
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:39,280
Yeah. Like putting it up before this the.

82
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:48,730
Yeah. I think the culture is kind of growing. And I haven't, I haven't, you know.

83
00:09:51,670 --> 00:10:00,710
Hey, remember what it was like that. But here's this site that is.

84
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:06,270
To fight for people to put up. We accepted the.

85
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:15,140
Hannah, I thought. If it's not peer reviewed.

86
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:21,450
Then you're just sort of really trusting in. A research team like this could have undergone.

87
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:29,420
Peer review, as we talked about a little bit more.

88
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:36,290
It's a long, drawn out and far from perfect prospect.

89
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:45,280
So I understand. Like. I don't know if you guys had experience with that or.

90
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:57,880
We're. Like when it was under review, but, you know, it was under review.

91
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:09,279
It's very strange. Okay? It's weird because I feel like there's a I mean, I know there is a whole kind of, you know, spoken science,

92
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:18,450
cause I believe in science and movements, feel like it's a business and people are very involved in terms of how.

93
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:31,380
How early the data and results are in. So one thing you can do in health and science, which, again, this is really common.

94
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:36,600
Apology. The Asian crisis. We'll talk more now.

95
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:41,730
But it's pre-registration of your sons and your question.

96
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:49,820
Undergraduate student undergraduate thesis is asking us to pre-register for.

97
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:58,460
He says. And there are certain parts of that. It's about second front areas and they're saying, I have to set policy for that study.

98
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:02,720
I'm going to put them up. It's a bad study.

99
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:10,620
In that case, maybe I could see it make more sense to the oh here were the results that we found to our pre registered question.

100
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:21,680
She kind of put a whole paper up there. It's interesting that the gentleman at the individual.

101
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:30,470
Yeah. I did that for the first time. Yeah.

102
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:38,230
It's not a it's definitely not a perfect process. And I think some of these efforts are trying to get information out there somewhere.

103
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,390
But I do I hope that we can retain the peer review process.

104
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:52,510
From. Data fabrication.

105
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:59,110
There's so much publishing pressure that like, what do you do with the preprint on the site where people just put their papers on?

106
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:08,459
I don't care if you take her in. You know, it's kind of the I think the goal and the goals is like have people review it?

107
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:16,340
Kind of why? That's great.

108
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,330
So did it eventually get out into the jungle? Yeah, that's.

109
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:35,620
Ever reviewed that. That's not.

110
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:44,510
Listeners also know what positive reviews that people received and.

111
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:48,750
Which is in the same manner as often as a reviewer.

112
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:53,250
While you're usually asked to share this review with like another.

113
00:13:54,890 --> 00:14:00,770
Gentlemen, I think as I think you share your identity, I don't know.

114
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:31,060
I hear that the defense would like that. What about you guys and me?

115
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,850
So I know one another. I think everybody has, like, a little bit different.

116
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:40,930
Just like a lot of experience with this kind of organizing, you know?

117
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:44,929
And that's always like I feel like that's sort of a shifting process anyway.

118
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:48,479
But I think almost everybody has, you know,

119
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:54,360
like work experience and like it makes sense to kind of cluster to me like work

120
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:57,730
experience and I think maybe a different community or even a few community.

121
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:03,170
But I was like, Oh, you could like pull us together and sort of get to be.

122
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:09,280
Organize your community focused work.

123
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:15,230
Find some more of that sort of. Especially for research which.

124
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,920
Is there a highway? Oh, I have all this expensive.

125
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:34,260
The publications would kind of go off the top and then off and there's like a scale paragraph which is like sort of resonates like for jobs.

126
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:48,490
In certain circles. Although I like the research suggesting that it could be a little bit more about the time.

127
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:03,110
Oh yeah, that's. And people have like some specialized trainings too.

128
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:09,580
And I feel like that's a nice thing to do also because it kind of highlights the skills and lessons.

129
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:14,810
Methodological training for training, specific program.

130
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:20,890
And with that, people will look at them and say, oh, what happened to this person that's after all these things?

131
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:30,130
And. Oh, yeah. And I think. In terms of the ATP is.

132
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:36,340
Um. Yeah. And I think everybody does like different formats.

133
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:44,800
But I want you to just think about like how the format, whatever for how you're doing that will work.

134
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:49,550
Just go back and check in and make sure you have a way to account for like.

135
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:53,950
These are my stated goals. These were met at this point in the town.

136
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,809
I know you did the right thing. So how did it feel with that kind of.

137
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:06,590
I know. It's kind of like going through a lot. Yeah, I was, but I was.

138
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:14,090
I was kind of like examining kids. And then I got to the bottom of the creative people.

139
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:17,980
I realized that they can pull everything together and get that.

140
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:24,040
So then I went back and started to fill in the blanks and knew everything because I really.

141
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:31,380
Well, yeah. Now it's really we've stop and think about every community because we didn't.

142
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,750
But I really had to go in and say, hey, this is my goal.

143
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,930
Go for that. For every single goal I made it was it.

144
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:47,500
It was nice to really, like, stop the thing.

145
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:58,050
And then they compounded when they actually it links your calendar to you if you wanted to do it based on the time this.

146
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:02,010
Yeah. Yeah. Okay, yeah, that's good.

147
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:08,919
Because I have heard a lot of, like you said, a lot of data entry and sort of got repetitive.

148
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:15,220
But then I have heard that the the benefits on of that are good and it's probably also good.

149
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:26,370
Look at this starting here full time. I mean, if you feel like you don't have time, you get some time to think like that.

150
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:31,340
And you might force yourself to think about doing it because it about the work environment you want.

151
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:39,359
I like it jump start because they feel the pressure reminded me of that, but I don't let it be credited.

152
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,440
It's like, what color isn't it? Here's where things.

153
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:48,450
We're confirming it based on that.

154
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,139
Yeah. Yeah. And that's what makes this table.

155
00:18:55,140 --> 00:19:01,200
That's also like these are the things that are really important to your career and I that I can see like shifting.

156
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:07,940
Right. That's the word. But it's. Think through all these dimensions that we don't always think about.

157
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:16,750
I have to work independently. My team. I'm less interested in death and there's always like an interest in most of the things.

158
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:22,600
But then there's like the sort of course you could say he's less interested in or like what it's like you're less attached.

159
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:41,550
And I said careers and they suggested oh yea, yea, yea, yea, yea yea.

160
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:53,290
So let's go. And hopefully I don't know if anybody has had a chance to go through and look at an incident like your adviser that that's different.

161
00:19:53,780 --> 00:20:04,740
I feel like that's a good. Things to do and erlotinib, it's really hard to say like, hey, we did this exercise in 848 and we were the.

162
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:08,990
Do you have any is that your husband might also have some tips about.

163
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:16,210
Here's what I found to be helpful is, you know. Can we also have this or, you know.

164
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:24,870
That's right. Not only on an audience like that.

165
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:31,530
Well. And Steve and the other.

166
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:38,640
And then as things come up to me as.

167
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:58,350
Test. And then oh, the other thing I wanted to talk about, to talk about.

168
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:05,170
In the presentations we have seen in an email that before. Okay.

169
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:11,950
So before you go I you'll go next to me and then in, in the class.

170
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:15,960
So are there any any questions that people.

171
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,290
Or eat or anything you write about.

172
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:30,590
Is it supposed to be? For the conceptual thing, or is it more of the actual people?

173
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:38,480
So it's really pretty rare to take the life of the most people in.

174
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:46,010
It has an opportunity to kind of present your kind of conceptual model for your research.

175
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:59,150
I think that's a plan. Yeah, I feel like that's exactly what I've done, that some people have used it as an opportunity to say, Oh, I had this.

176
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:05,630
Specific skills that you want to be able to teach about aircraft and.

177
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:13,910
Like at least one person. I thought about method.

178
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:18,830
But you don't have a conclusion about this.

179
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:23,990
I was researching just random topics, but.

180
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:33,510
And I think it's sort of cult teaching sort of sort of evolved, too, because I think that.

181
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:40,260
Then they show me the way back to the right.

182
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:50,330
Like. Sort of a demonstration of how you can present.

183
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:58,059
Like almost everybody, his life skills. It is, I think even though it is such good practice all that and it's hard when you're

184
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:01,719
when you're providing your own stuff I think like it's new and you're like,

185
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:07,959
I'm will talk about this stuff before and I like illustrate them verbally, you know, so there's always the practice.

186
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:11,120
But I think it was initially an assignment where people kind of came.

187
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:21,220
So I think it made it. I'll take that information.

188
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:28,090
Which I think is helpful because then you can have a conversation about. But I also.

189
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:37,060
Are there beatings? Yeah. Are you going to personally.

190
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:44,860
I think I felt like two readings. Yeah. Okay.

191
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:49,860
Yeah. And one is fine to have the poetry on your topic.

192
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:54,350
That's great. Yeah.

193
00:23:56,260 --> 00:24:00,550
Yeah. And I think it's nice that you guys look at each on a separate day and have a conversation.

194
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:09,250
That and. We will do some other topics in those days, but that's all was a little bit in time.

195
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:12,860
So hello. Oh, no. I need to check.

196
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:22,780
What time? If we just upload our site of the day that I'm presenting to candidates or do.

197
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:39,960
I know you can just. Yeah.

198
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:45,290
Okay. So anything any questions on my.

199
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:52,459
The same kind of stuff. But the paper.

200
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:57,940
The funny thing is that it's supposed to be a lecture. So that's a little bit.

201
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:05,160
Yeah. I mean not this kind of shift that these around as in response really to what people are.

202
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:12,820
So basically the they all kind of claim that for the output.

203
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:24,640
And so the teaching research topic, teaching presentation is like I sort of have an oral presentation before September 11, know and like posing.

204
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,810
Maybe there are some questions to ask here. Maybe there's a gap that's kind of ending there.

205
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,530
But for any kind of research question or something like that.

206
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:47,070
Final paper draft. This one is more around the literature review and also pinpointing where you are going to go in your.

207
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:52,550
In your research. So it's kind of connected. It's kind of like.

208
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:59,230
Draft is like the draft, the written draft of the oral presentation that you do the whole.

209
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:10,990
Yes. And then. I didn't want you guys to have to write an entire research proposal that feels like too much.

210
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:17,000
It's a class of students that I know that in the research proposal.

211
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:33,309
So this is what I to do. And and that's like research questions how I would do that.

212
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:39,969
And this is why also the kind of vary because people are like, oh, I know I'm ensconced in this project going to be doing that.

213
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:44,560
So I guess it's an opportunity to like really lay out what I actually do.

214
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:53,200
And some people have had I think that's probably most helpful, but not everybody is in that situation.

215
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:58,180
So you could sort of have a feeling broader like, oh, I haven't been writing that because I do think that's.

216
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:08,580
And so that's the proposal. And then here the final paper is the sort of the sort of background and significant sections of, I think, that proposal.

217
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:20,899
So like. Without it, and of the final features of a Polish literature review appear like one person.

218
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:28,210
I think most of us ended up submitting his own interview for this like journal when I had published.

219
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:32,720
So if you guys want to. It's not required.

220
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:36,530
But if you wanted to make a cake. Impressive.

221
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:43,880
At least, you know, with this paper, it's like a motivator that if you feel like you're typing,

222
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:55,499
you know me from what I loosely know each of your topics to be sure to write something that feels like literature.

223
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:55,890
And you.

224
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:06,470
Not a systematic review, but might be a sweeping review or something and meet with her and sort of saying, okay, I'm going to work on this paper.

225
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:12,670
And the 1300 final stages of English Literature Review said, Don't worry,

226
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:21,610
but if you guys wanted to think about it that way and say, gosh, in a year, I would like to submit it as a review.

227
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:38,550
That would be great. Okay. Uh, I think the other thing to note about this final paper is that it's kind of like you get up to research question.

228
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:44,790
The research questions may be obvious, but not to presence.

229
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:51,380
That's right. People are thinking about things that not bringing up.

230
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:57,300
Okay. Now that we've been very aware of, that would mean that necessary.

231
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:01,740
A stepson of that practice. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

232
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:06,890
So it kind of pops around a little bit about in that order, I suppose, with any.

233
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:14,940
Just right. And I'm also I mean, let me know your best thoughts, because I'm also totally upfront.

234
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:21,390
I don't want to force people to do their research topic because they're also feeling like they're still exploring that like I am.

235
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:28,460
Photographer was all I had to do the presentation, and that's why I left it open.

236
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:38,060
It's confusing, but. Yeah.

237
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:48,810
And I should. I have three friends on campus for these assignments that I might do here.

238
00:29:52,610 --> 00:30:06,330
There's more description of each. I know.

239
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:16,590
I feel this fine here about. Sorry. Let's go to the fever.

240
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:25,520
During my treatment days. Yeah some of really that sort of consideration.

241
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:32,370
Be really. But this is sort of like kind of like marching through the U.S.

242
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:39,190
But it's not up to the presentation so that you can see that consideration.

243
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:48,580
Should have been to date. Like you should be able to.

244
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:57,590
And it's kind of ending here at like zero.

245
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:06,500
What hypotheses have emerged. So, you know, like it should be sort of a range of different person.

246
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:13,290
And then I researched. I think it. Yeah.

247
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,990
Yeah. And that's why I like it as a presentation, because it can be so much more interactive.

248
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:21,210
I'm like, you know, you haven't ever seen, like, the. Or.

249
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:33,110
Thank you for the talk personally presenting ideas. And even in reviewing papers like that, the French president for everybody is the same thing.

250
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:36,650
Everybody wants to engage with that part.

251
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:44,160
So I. You like the oral presentation. Proposal is a really nice way to do it all.

252
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:48,160
Make your time. And I think that works really nicely.

253
00:31:52,380 --> 00:32:02,900
Is there any question? Opportunities. And so what you want to do and like very you have to do this is exactly one of the ways I could have gone.

254
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:06,570
Why did I choose my writing? And that.

255
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:17,110
That's where people. You should have done it my way and say, well, I think about that and there's pros and cons.

256
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:23,170
And so we decided. So that's why I like that.

257
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:30,590
All right, because you guys will be left behind in the mining and coal fields.

258
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:37,560
Or at least a good background for papers in your papers.

259
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:44,560
I'm not scared. Could get you started on it.

260
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:49,019
Oh. Cool.

261
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:54,510
So. So. Well, let's think about conceptual models and it's good.

262
00:32:57,030 --> 00:33:00,420
So I guess I didn't do a regression. I feel for this class.

263
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:06,200
Every Brit has less. Yeah, yeah.

264
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:11,380
But hopefully there's enough structure and hopefully I feel like some of those I give too much information and then it's confusing.

265
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:16,830
Okay. Uh, so, um.

266
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:27,520
Yeah. So thinking about conceptual models, hopefully what we can get to do today is have minimum of one or two because we can,

267
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:31,300
like, work through an example and then we can do another one coming up tomorrow, next week.

268
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:38,530
But let me see what I've got here on the models that we can go through.

269
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:41,720
I think some of this we can go through a little bit. Quickly.

270
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:48,090
So thinking about conceptual models, I think.

271
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:53,940
Yeah, I was going to get those readings that delay the reading of the public health consequence.

272
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:57,510
I always like that because it's kind of a nice like, why are we doing this stuff?

273
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:07,320
And at the same time, it's that always way up there at the huge picture.

274
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:11,250
It's really hard to like get to our research question and devote yourself to like

275
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:17,490
the minutia of what you need to do in creating a research proposal and then that.

276
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:28,740
That really never happened before. It's an older man.

277
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:36,820
It's kind of like I feel like it's a kind of selected classic because it goes through are these different specific ways to think about testing models.

278
00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:42,700
And then here we'll go through this.

279
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:43,719
But there are some examples.

280
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:51,190
There are just these example papers that we can we'll talk about, but just sort of how they develop conceptual models that are testable.

281
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:57,010
And there's conceptual models that are out, you know, like frameworks, big picture that are not necessarily testable.

282
00:34:57,010 --> 00:35:00,430
And then how do we get to like a testable model,

283
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:07,600
even if we're a lot of the language around it is like statistical structural Bayesian model type language,

284
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:18,370
but the conceptual model is still underlying, like I would say, any research question, I know Arlene does not like conceptual models.

285
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:21,750
I don't know if she's mentioned this, but I don't personally.

286
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:30,070
Oh gosh, everything has some sort of conceptual assumptions and understandings and hypotheses about how things work together.

287
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:37,540
So we'll kind of we'll talk a little bit about this, that kind of way of thinking about it.

288
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:41,250
But just to keep in mind, like, it's more broad than that.

289
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:48,430
And then I always love that. Amy, did you say that it seems your advisors and others really.

290
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:55,060
Oh, okay. Yeah, she was my. Okay.

291
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:11,780
But so far. I like the Browns and reading, too, because it's also about like the whole,

292
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:17,559
you know, all of our practice experience and, you know, everything like that.

293
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:28,270
You guys have all done in your CV using your history to date, you know, everything like comes in to inform our research plans.

294
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:35,530
And then this is also that idea of, you know, scholars before researchers like knowing your areas.

295
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:43,670
Okay. So this is the public health public health consequence piece.

296
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:54,510
The goal with public health is this idea of what are the health risks that pose the greatest morbidity, mortality and costs.

297
00:36:54,560 --> 00:37:00,860
And so I think these are the kinds of things that we can, again, big picture like in our careers.

298
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:07,100
Think about where our research sits. So how much will change if this research happens?

299
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:11,870
What are the ethics of it? Does it reduce health inequities?

300
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,380
Does it affect practice? Is it providing evidence?

301
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,450
Is it like research? That's like basic research that's kind of building the evidence base.

302
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:26,990
And then how do we kind of communicate that? And then are we solutions focused?

303
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:33,800
So. That, you know, again, this is a big picture.

304
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:40,969
It's not every single research project or keeper or question that you're asking needs to address all of these things.

305
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:45,290
But it's like thinking career wise, you kind of want to move towards these.

306
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:50,000
And then I like the way that this piece talked about.

307
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:58,250
Sort of tailoring your questions to. To to drag solutions.

308
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:05,649
And so, you know, sometimes we think about that a lot and sometimes we, like, get in our like research interests and we don't think about it.

309
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:13,180
So I think it's good to kind of just be pulled out every once in a while and be like, okay, what is my what is the focus?

310
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:18,640
What is the solution? I'd be like, You mean towards and then this.

311
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:29,350
I also like in this, like in this paper some examples of what we have seen to do,

312
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:36,579
what kind of public health, public health research we've seen that could contribute to solutions.

313
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:44,049
And sometimes when things go sideways, an understanding of how policy changes even that's our goal.

314
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:47,260
Like we want to understand could there be any negative effects?

315
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:52,900
And sometimes we can't anticipate them. But sometimes we can.

316
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:59,560
And so understanding how, you know, that you're helping to create a solution,

317
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:02,830
you could also be helping to, you know, do something else that you're unaware of.

318
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:06,160
So just sort of taking that broad view. Okay.

319
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:13,650
And so the other thing I like about that meeting.

320
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:23,530
That environment. One is that it's really talked about that issue of like what are your favorite variables?

321
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:34,450
And then how do you like how do you kind of streamline and develop your conceptual models so that they are testable?

322
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:43,480
And I think this this is so it's like it's so hard, but I think it's really important.

323
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:51,219
And I think that at the beginning of your PhD, you're not necessarily you may not have favorite concepts like probably all of you,

324
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:54,790
but you may not know yet what your really favorite ones are.

325
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:59,499
And so you still like a broadening phase, right?

326
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:02,690
You're still kind of like gathering for concepts that you're interested in and

327
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:08,460
that will ultimately like live in your different models but eventually will,

328
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:13,420
you know, to get move toward a research question in any one area, you have to kind of, you know,

329
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:21,040
streamline or slim your concepts to get to a scope that is testable but still meaningful.

330
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:30,190
So balancing that like big scale, are we doing solutions, really helping and is my research contributing to general knowledge to practice?

331
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:37,810
But how can I also do research that is focused enough so that I can ask some questions and find out more information?

332
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:49,959
And then that Sondra Blair readings, he often is talking about these questions on the big picture,

333
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:58,180
what matters if we're talking about an intervention when we might situate that intervention in the life span and certainly for him.

334
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:04,360
So in your final papers, you're definitely going to talk about like what matters?

335
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:11,290
You're definitely going to talk about for him and may end up talking about the when in the life span.

336
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:14,920
Sometimes that's more salient for certain questions and others.

337
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:21,640
But I think for all of you guys, you might have like a life span like overlay or situation.

338
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:27,280
And then in the proposal you're going to be delving into, okay, what's feasible and testable.

339
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:35,319
And I think that's why it's nice to sort of be big and broad and thinking about these and knowing

340
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:42,340
you're going to get to balancing unspeakable testable and this phrase of practice based evidence.

341
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:50,960
I don't know if everybody is familiar with that kind of phrase, but that concept of, again, like using what you guys have gotten, you know,

342
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:54,549
done in your previous jobs and experiences,

343
00:41:54,550 --> 00:42:04,629
which everybody has like really amazing rich experiences through and using that as evidence for driving research questions.

344
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:12,700
And that's, you know, a little bit of a flip because we always talk about like evidence based practice and practice based evidence.

345
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:16,060
I think is a nice way to remind ourselves that, okay,

346
00:42:16,690 --> 00:42:23,920
evidence we've got to evidence based practice hopefully by getting some practice based evidence as well.

347
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:34,710
Um. Okay. So I wanted to dove into a little bit of this again.

348
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:44,590
I mean, this is like. But what is a conceptual model versus like a theory or a framework?

349
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:53,049
And we'll also talk about directed if I never can say the words.

350
00:42:53,050 --> 00:43:02,950
Right, but those DAG diagrams. And I feel like I use the term conceptual model a little bit more broadly than those diagrams.

351
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:10,209
But I feel like a conceptual model is more pointed and focused than a theory,

352
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:17,530
which is of course really like or even a framework that sort of says, I'm approaching this area of research.

353
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:24,670
You know, using this framework, which has assumptions, but it's still a big, broad paradigm.

354
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:30,520
It's just sort of more situating where your research questions live and then your conceptual model,

355
00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:34,590
if we like, force ourselves to do it, which will practice today.

356
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:45,010
It is this diagram of proposed causal linkages among variables that are your constructs and concepts of interest,

357
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:49,960
and that relates to specific ideas on how concepts are like explanatory model.

358
00:43:52,290 --> 00:44:01,460
What is going on in that research question? Does that make sense?

359
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:04,230
That sort of narrowing of what they what they.

360
00:44:05,270 --> 00:44:12,139
But these sort of terms are because I think we can get into the habit of using them a little bit interchangeably.

361
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:15,230
And sort of we think about like, what level are we talking about here?

362
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:23,400
Am I trying to describe my conceptual model here? And usually like in a grant proposal, certainly in an age like big grant proposal.

363
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:33,380
So you see you have a conceptual model of like your proposed, you know, the way that you see the world with regard to this outcome.

364
00:44:33,950 --> 00:44:41,900
And of course, there are also logic models, which I'm not talking about, but those are the ones that are.

365
00:44:44,370 --> 00:44:49,690
Really focused on the steps. By which you might achieve your outcomes.

366
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:56,080
The conceptual model is not getting to the level of the logic model, but they like they like interface.

367
00:44:58,510 --> 00:45:05,530
And one thing also to think about in grant proposal situations is that you need to be linked to a theory.

368
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:13,990
Sometimes you can talk about the framework and the theory, but usually if there's a theory,

369
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:19,900
you can base your conceptual model sort of directly on the constructs that a theory talks about.

370
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:27,180
And if your area of research is not. Which is like harder to link to a specific theory.

371
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:34,180
I feel like that framework is like a good place to start. Okay.

372
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:38,330
When we talk about grant writing, we'll talk also more about like the different kind of,

373
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:44,830
you know, kind of visual representations of the project that might end up in the grant proposal.

374
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:57,680
And like, for example, NIH does not really do logic models and read proposals, but they very much want the conceptual model, CDC or her.

375
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:00,930
We really want conceptual.

376
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:08,370
We really want logic models because they want to see what are the steps, what are the inputs and outputs, what are the outcomes?

377
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:13,240
So there are different. Sort of types of today.

378
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:23,580
And this is kind of what I was saying, but. The theories or frameworks help us kind of like zero in on the constructs that we care about.

379
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:32,530
These concerts are really important for my outcome. And they also help us predict for how might these concerts interact.

380
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:37,330
I would say that our variables, our operational definitions of our constructs.

381
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:45,300
And then once you you know, again, I was talking about the rabbit hole that like we're so we get so sucked into it.

382
00:46:45,310 --> 00:46:53,890
Like our question is good then to like revisit where did this conceptual model come from or do these theories and frameworks,

383
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:58,950
you know, what would they say as sort of the next step? After I looked at this conception.

384
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:08,029
And then the other thing, of course, and this is where research is creative and innovative and we like to make change,

385
00:47:08,030 --> 00:47:13,790
is that conceptual models are not only sort of tied to one theory or framework,

386
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:20,680
and I think much of the kind of great interdisciplinary work is like, well, we have this theory over here, we have this theory over here.

387
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:25,399
We're both trying to predict mental functioning. Well, that's interesting.

388
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:30,230
You know, so then you sort of start pulling things together in a logical way,

389
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:35,720
sometimes in a really nasty way, and then you kind of impose order on it.

390
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:42,110
Okay. Okay.

391
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:54,180
Well, we'll talk more about the club open. I would say, like this idea of like steps in developing, like, like we can really kind of just break it.

392
00:47:56,030 --> 00:48:06,170
Down a very basic way. And so we'll we'll do this we'll do this in a minute.

393
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:12,610
But these are these sort of. I hesitate to say universal,

394
00:48:12,610 --> 00:48:20,550
but I think pretty much these are steps that would go through in thinking about what is my conceptual model for my research and my research question.

395
00:48:21,410 --> 00:48:25,570
So we're thinking about what's my outcome of interest, what am I working toward?

396
00:48:25,590 --> 00:48:32,510
So back to that like big picture, public health of consequence, like what am I trying to change in the world or what am I trying to understand better?

397
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:40,310
And I don't want to be measured like, is this something that we think is really important?

398
00:48:40,310 --> 00:48:43,900
But like maybe we got to go back and figure out how to measure it.

399
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:48,200
So there's a lot here because then you can think about, well,

400
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:53,359
this is my album of interest and really where my research is going to be is like exploding how to measure it.

401
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:56,059
But there's all this also these reasons that it happens.

402
00:48:56,060 --> 00:49:01,670
So I'm going to talk about doing mixed methods and how to measure this better and how to really articulate my construct.

403
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:05,470
And that can be like where your research career is.

404
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:11,270
You can be there, but you also want to think about what kind of how does it get predicted and shaped by other things.

405
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:18,500
And so here select potential variables that are measures of your concepts to include.

406
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:21,590
So what is relevant to your outcome?

407
00:49:21,770 --> 00:49:33,259
What would you hypothesize to be important for the things that you're trying to predict and then determining how these variables,

408
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:38,540
what's the nature of their association with the outcome? So can theory inform us?

409
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:43,610
Can prior research inform us? Like, do you have a study that's like who these guys are looking at?

410
00:49:43,610 --> 00:49:47,910
All my variables, but in a different outcome that like I really understand.

411
00:49:47,930 --> 00:49:52,790
I really, you know, this is the way I see the world works with these, you know, in this study.

412
00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:56,029
But they happen to be looking at substance abuse.

413
00:49:56,030 --> 00:49:58,640
And I want to look at anxiety or depression.

414
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:06,710
But then that's also where the practice based evidence comes in, because you guys have all had awesome experiences that you could say.

415
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:16,490
It's so interesting to me that this whole area of research never considers X thing that I know is important from lots of different experiences.

416
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:25,009
And then what we do is like that's where it sort of starts to feel like causal modeling and statistics.

417
00:50:25,010 --> 00:50:35,780
But even if we're not and this is where it diverges a little bit from the those DAG diagrams, even if we're not able to test it at the beginning,

418
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:39,470
I feel like what I like to do in here and like in the first, you know,

419
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:45,170
kind of beginnings of history program is like what are the linkages among these concepts?

420
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:48,680
Like, am I, am I going to get myself in a situation where I'm like, you know,

421
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:52,639
these I'm never going to be able to test the causality between these two.

422
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,200
They just coexist in my models.

423
00:50:54,200 --> 00:51:00,080
I'm just going to put them up there because they're an important background for my model, but I'm not going to be able to examine those.

424
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:07,700
My research question. But I feel like here we want to think about how everything is in your model and how they potentially relate,

425
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:14,610
even if the arrows are going by directionality, which is hard to test cluster dynamic systems model, which I'm not of,

426
00:51:14,630 --> 00:51:19,820
I think that's awesome and I think that's kind of where we get into testing those, but we're going to be simpler today.

427
00:51:20,690 --> 00:51:25,850
And then this idea of like me as an existing model, as a starting point, because there's something I left out.

428
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:30,979
Or are there other constructs or contexts that you'd like to place the model in?

429
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:36,410
So like, did they do an intervention that used, you know,

430
00:51:37,430 --> 00:51:44,690
motivational interviewing in a college student population and now you want to try it in a, you know, middle school population?

431
00:51:44,690 --> 00:51:46,249
Like, how would you shift things around?

432
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:50,390
What would be other things that would be important in measuring the middle schoolers versus the college students?

433
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:52,190
Okay.

434
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:59,750
And so this is sort of the really this is an example of a not totally testable model, but sort of a conceptual model of how the world might work.

435
00:52:02,310 --> 00:52:11,700
And just talking, for example. So overweight and obesity is like the outcome of interests that we that we're hoping

436
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:18,450
to explain a little bit of that can be measured in very imperfect ways and again,

437
00:52:18,450 --> 00:52:27,059
with people's careers to be clear and saying like, I'm going to argue against the measure here, you know, the use of BMI as a measure is really bad.

438
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:30,900
And we need to look at fatness. And that's like your entire career.

439
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:36,090
So here variables and constructs that are relevant to the outcome.

440
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:40,920
Well, certainly between childhood obesity and child biology,

441
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:45,300
lots of different things to be looked at, their child health behaviors like eating and diet.

442
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:52,530
And then this particular conceptual model is trying to look at, okay,

443
00:52:52,530 --> 00:53:01,379
I think these variables are related to my outcome based on like developmental theory and other things and practice based evidence that

444
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:10,210
we think that parenting certainly contributes biology to cell biology and stress contributes to biology and factors individual health,

445
00:53:10,230 --> 00:53:18,130
computers, like do you have a routine? And this model is interested in bringing in this new concept of child self-regulation.

446
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:23,790
So like how well children can control impulsive behavior and focus attention, this kind of thing.

447
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:33,920
How does that relate to the features that there's got to be that are, and that this is kind of one of the contexts that's important to consider?

448
00:53:34,310 --> 00:53:42,100
So, like, how does early access to safe behaviors and child self-regulation and directly by the end of a photo?

449
00:53:42,630 --> 00:53:49,910
So you can see there's a lot of arrows here. Like you have to have a really big, you know, statistical sample to really test all of this.

450
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:55,710
And these variables are not clearly defined as a variable.

451
00:53:55,730 --> 00:53:57,430
They're still kind of at that concept level,

452
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:04,940
like all these things fall under this general concept and then they're, you know, so across time, like what?

453
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:13,549
How would this model look different in different contexts? So what do you think about those steps?

454
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:24,610
Does that sort of seem logical? Thinking about your variables, which we'll do in a minute, that might be included in a conceptual model.

455
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:31,320
Can everybody kind of. Not even the picture but point like these steps.

456
00:54:33,530 --> 00:54:37,070
But around the variables that you might be. Pondering.

457
00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:55,160
Okay. So why don't we? We can take a minute to consider and jot down concepts that you think you might put in the model.

458
00:54:55,580 --> 00:54:56,959
You just like the circles.

459
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:03,860
Those types of ideas of like these are the things that I think are important and I want to, like, think through how they might fit together.

460
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:08,640
So. And actually, I guess I should say one.

461
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:21,500
Square. So is there an outcome of interest or a topic or even more broadly of interest that might go into your conceptual model?

462
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:28,780
And then we can talk through. In the next few slides, the nuts and bolts of how conceptual models could fit together.

463
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:33,820
And so just so you guys are like trying to think about variables there for

464
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:37,810
concepts that you might care about that might pop up in a conceptual model of.

465
00:55:43,250 --> 00:56:55,320
Of what you might be looking at. And then.

466
00:56:57,810 --> 00:57:08,370
I think what we'll do, I'll go through some slides and then we'll go play with putting people's circles up onto the board.

467
00:58:45,090 --> 00:58:54,680
Does everybody have some. Some circles. Pulled out identified circles that might be relevant in their model.

468
00:58:56,050 --> 00:59:07,520
Or squares. Because next we'll talk a little just a little bit about just like the heroes.

469
00:59:13,770 --> 00:59:22,080
So say that. I often say that I'm not a statistical expert, but this is where like that sort of.

470
00:59:24,110 --> 00:59:31,700
Transition between like conceptual model understanding statistical assumptions and study designs.

471
00:59:32,390 --> 00:59:39,960
Like, it all kind of comes together. And it gets revised as you kind of increase your understanding of each of those things.

472
00:59:39,970 --> 00:59:46,930
So sort of like what I feel like it's helpful to do here is just like literally throw things up at the wall as a starting point.

473
00:59:47,710 --> 00:59:54,460
And then as we go forward, think more about, oh, well, statistically,

474
00:59:54,460 --> 01:00:05,080
this one could go over here or I could break this part of my model out and do a side project on that piece of it.

475
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:11,020
It could be so. Okay.

476
01:00:12,940 --> 01:00:16,620
I'll talk a little bit about the nuts and bolts, and then we can go through someone's example.

477
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:23,940
Okay. So this is a little more on the nuts and bolts, but this is associations among variables.

478
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:32,970
So this is. One of these things that's like sort of basic, but it's good, I think, always to pause and think through.

479
01:00:33,890 --> 01:00:41,050
The nuts and bolts. And so, again, like the variables and operational definition of our concept of interest.

480
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:50,009
One note is that. Make them the most basic things in the world.

481
01:00:50,010 --> 01:01:01,650
But you're variables so variability and so this is just that idea of like we can really, really care about a concept,

482
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:12,420
but we may not have like a data set that has variability in that concept and that means we really can't test it well, at least in that dataset.

483
01:01:13,230 --> 01:01:19,930
And so. That's I know it seems like a very obvious concept,

484
01:01:19,930 --> 01:01:28,000
but sometimes when we are dealing with like real data and questions and variables that sort of we can a little bit forget about that sometimes.

485
01:01:28,010 --> 01:01:35,650
So if you think of the example of like if you have an entire sample that's like living in poverty,

486
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:44,470
then you can't test the impact of poverty on her outcome because your whole sample has no variability in that.

487
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:49,870
You could test something else that varies, but you can't test poverty impact on your variable.

488
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:54,460
So that's just something to keep in mind. And so I'll just put through some terms.

489
01:01:54,460 --> 01:02:02,350
So the idea of antecedent factors are just factors in the background that like are probably important to know about,

490
01:02:02,890 --> 01:02:10,390
may have causal implications for your outcome, but were not necessarily going to be able to intervene on them.

491
01:02:10,390 --> 01:02:12,820
And they're not like your kind of lame questions.

492
01:02:12,820 --> 01:02:20,110
But like I always think of conceptual models as like the big one of like that you hang on your wall and you like to look at and you go,

493
01:02:20,110 --> 01:02:25,630
What part of my conceptual model, my thinking about today, like those antecedent background factors are helpful to put in there.

494
01:02:26,410 --> 01:02:28,870
And then we have those like action variables.

495
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:37,840
So like our predictor variables, independent exposure treatment variables, this person goes by many names, outcomes are dependent variables.

496
01:02:39,250 --> 01:02:46,840
And this is where I always say like I'm not an epidemiologist and work with people on like covariant or like confounder and like,

497
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:56,440
what's the difference again? So just, you know, confounder is the idea that a variable and in the psychology of the third variable.

498
01:02:57,490 --> 01:03:02,229
So this idea of like it associates with both the outcome and predictor but it's sort

499
01:03:02,230 --> 01:03:08,860
of not as much of interest to you probably as your and some other variables might be.

500
01:03:08,860 --> 01:03:17,079
So like here, age is a confounder between height and shoe size and it's sort of irrelevant

501
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:20,680
because we're not interested in the association between fate and shoe size,

502
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:22,840
but we know that age affects them both.

503
01:03:25,590 --> 01:03:34,479
So those are important to think through those kind of variables that are like causally related to the variables in your model,

504
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:41,250
but ones that are not your focus. And then here we have covariant, which is, I think, a little more of a broad term.

505
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:46,750
And again. Depending on who your collaborators are.

506
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:50,430
That's why I put up a lot of these different terms because they can all kind of come out.

507
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:59,200
But the covariant is also, as we know, like something that we may want to control for in our in our, you know, DNA.

508
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:02,409
So. Okay. And then here's that.

509
01:04:02,410 --> 01:04:07,920
So I feel like these are really interesting action variables and these are some other interesting action variables.

510
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:18,249
So we have our mediators which. And I'm sure everyone's at this hour any point like the terms mediator and moderator which we probably

511
01:04:18,250 --> 01:04:25,000
have all heard those terms drive me a little bit around the bend because I felt they're really confusing

512
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:33,010
unnecessarily and the way that I had learned mediator and moderator before this like classic article

513
01:04:33,010 --> 01:04:38,980
came out that sort of defined some specific terms was intervening variables and conditional variables.

514
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:43,780
And I feel like that can be helpful in understanding, just sort of remembering what's a mediator,

515
01:04:43,780 --> 01:04:52,630
what's a moderator to the mediators of the variables that come between your predictor outcomes and they explain the variance that is.

516
01:04:55,920 --> 01:05:03,240
Causing your predictor outcome to be associated there, like the reason for the association or APC?

517
01:05:03,330 --> 01:05:04,230
One of the reasons.

518
01:05:06,470 --> 01:05:14,090
And that's why I like intervening because it really it's like you're mediators like in the pathway between your predictor and your outcome.

519
01:05:18,930 --> 01:05:23,880
And then a moderator, in contrast, is the conditions under which.

520
01:05:26,810 --> 01:05:30,110
Your predictor and outcome are associated or not associated.

521
01:05:30,290 --> 01:05:34,520
To kind of keep it simple. But it moderates the association.

522
01:05:36,650 --> 01:05:39,950
And so it is a conditional variable.

523
01:05:40,100 --> 01:05:48,860
I mean in like we test these are interaction terms or stratifying our samples, we can say like let's look at as sex as an example.

524
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:54,560
It's not necessarily a good example always of like dichotomous.

525
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:59,780
Sex is becoming more of a continuous variable in some ways, right?

526
01:06:01,070 --> 01:06:03,740
But if we're saying, okay, we have boys and girls,

527
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:09,770
we're going to look at how this relationship looks at boys and we're going to look at how this relationship looks in girls.

528
01:06:10,620 --> 01:06:17,850
And so in that example, if the relationship between our predictor and outcome is true for boys but not true for girls.

529
01:06:18,490 --> 01:06:21,550
Sex is the moderator of that association.

530
01:06:22,390 --> 01:06:28,060
It's conditional upon whether. Participants, boys or participants are.

531
01:06:31,230 --> 01:06:35,320
And I'm saying like something is true for boys and not true for girls.

532
01:06:36,150 --> 01:06:43,080
That's like a situation that is not super common because we rarely have like something that's fully moderated.

533
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:47,250
It's more like it's less true for boys, it's more true for girls.

534
01:06:47,250 --> 01:06:51,389
It's an it's a positive association for boys. It's a negative association for girls.

535
01:06:51,390 --> 01:06:55,230
Like it's slightly different, but it's not it's rare, I would say,

536
01:06:55,230 --> 01:07:01,260
in any kind of social health research that like something is totally true for this group and not true to that group.

537
01:07:04,090 --> 01:07:05,100
But I'll say one more thing.

538
01:07:05,100 --> 01:07:12,330
So why these are important like why it's important to understand is what we call like more broadly, the mechanisms of action,

539
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:18,000
like what explains the nature of association between predictor and outcome is

540
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:22,980
that this tells us like what we need to do to kind of change those associations.

541
01:07:23,250 --> 01:07:32,880
Like it tells us whether we want to think about a way to like interrupt the pathway between, you know,

542
01:07:33,990 --> 01:07:43,890
smoking and lung cancer or whether we want to change like the conditions under which that association can emerge.

543
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:49,180
So they're a little bit different. In terms of where our interventions might occur.

544
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:59,130
And I also always talk about moderators or or sorry, conditional variables in intervention as like what works best for whom.

545
01:07:59,580 --> 01:08:03,959
They help us answer this question. Moderators What works best for you?

546
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:15,120
Because you can say, Oh, we have this intervention that works for like, you know, white non moms, but it didn't work for Latina moms of young kids.

547
01:08:15,460 --> 01:08:25,980
So like, that's our moderator variable. And so we're saying, okay, let's figure out among the Latina moms of young kids how this association is.

548
01:08:26,420 --> 01:08:30,709
Emerging and how it's been becoming and how the pathway is.

549
01:08:30,710 --> 01:08:32,850
And that's where we get back to our mediators.

550
01:08:32,870 --> 01:08:41,389
So I think it can get really confusing because moderated mediation and all these terms are thrown around.

551
01:08:41,390 --> 01:08:46,340
And I think it's good to kind of just get back to like the care we talking about the Pathway Association or

552
01:08:46,340 --> 01:08:54,410
we think something is intervening in this pathway or are we thinking about is it like a group difference?

553
01:08:54,910 --> 01:09:00,010
The condition also seems to be and it's never that clear in our own research,

554
01:09:00,010 --> 01:09:07,660
because this is just like a helpful way to look past the world and statistics which no one knows is helpful.

555
01:09:07,930 --> 01:09:11,919
It is very helpful to think about, but it's also like once you get your own variables,

556
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:16,360
it's very easy to just be like, Oh, it could be a mediator and a moderator.

557
01:09:16,370 --> 01:09:23,410
It's probably both, and I don't know how to categorize it. So like that's when you get into like that real world of like, here's my conceptual model,

558
01:09:23,860 --> 01:09:29,799
here's what the data I have in my sample and here's the variables that I measured and here's how they kind of work together.

559
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:38,480
So that kind of. It's a hard thing to pull them all together sometimes and it gets harder, I think, as you get closer to your data sometimes.

560
01:09:39,270 --> 01:09:43,170
Because it's hard to kind of like then abstract out sometimes.

561
01:09:45,030 --> 01:09:52,300
Okay. So. I think you will go on and just look at some of these and then we best.

562
01:09:52,640 --> 01:10:02,920
So this is one of these again, so abstract, but an example of thinking about each of these variables, variable types.

563
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:09,640
So here we have exposure to a predictor, a variable to our outcome variable.

564
01:10:10,780 --> 01:10:14,679
We have our confounder that's associated with both.

565
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:19,240
But we kind of for this model, we're like don't care super much about confounder.

566
01:10:19,780 --> 01:10:23,589
And then we have our mediator and the intervening variable saying like,

567
01:10:23,590 --> 01:10:29,250
I'm on the pathway between exposure and outcome and then moderator is always a little hard to do.

568
01:10:29,260 --> 01:10:30,190
You guys have done this before?

569
01:10:30,190 --> 01:10:37,749
I think hard to represent visually because it's often like something that we break apart and do in the graph if we have results.

570
01:10:37,750 --> 01:10:44,410
But the moderator is sort of saying like under this condition, this relationship is true.

571
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:48,190
If that condition is not there, then that relationship is not true.

572
01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:57,430
And then pairs of covariate just to the outcome the same like we know this is the outcome and so we're going to include it in our model.

573
01:10:57,430 --> 01:11:00,820
And then this is just the example. So it's. Deprivation.

574
01:11:01,750 --> 01:11:12,700
A low birth weight that can travel through diet so you cannot control deprivation of food or diet and thus lower birth weight.

575
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:18,340
Maternal age contributes possibly to deprivation and to low birth weight.

576
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:23,860
And whether or not mom smokes. Can kick off the relationship, right.

577
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:31,830
When she's focused on this relationship, that's going to be stronger and she's not stepping back and sort of blocking the impact of that diet.

578
01:11:34,970 --> 01:11:38,600
And then maternal height, we think, doesn't have to do with deprivation. Oh, good.

579
01:11:39,620 --> 01:11:42,900
Then it goes to lower. Just thinking through.

580
01:11:45,320 --> 01:11:49,450
Okay. So.

581
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:57,550
Let me see. I think we could do.

582
01:11:57,560 --> 01:12:05,540
One of your guys is someone up for doing like a little drawing on the board and a conceptual model just to have fun.

583
01:12:09,670 --> 01:12:16,260
We don't have to, but it's kind of. I think it's a pull or at least put up the circles that we've been thinking.

584
01:12:16,270 --> 01:12:24,920
We've been thinking about. And we can all kind of muse on what kind of associations we think they might have.

585
01:12:27,190 --> 01:12:36,740
But it looks like these areas are one in. Yeah, either.

586
01:12:36,770 --> 01:12:40,399
Either. I mean, they're pretty. I mean, they're comparable.

587
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:44,900
I mean, like you could say so like mediators, like, I don't know, like the moderators here,

588
01:12:44,900 --> 01:12:48,709
but like this sort of thinking of the parent factors as a mediator.

589
01:12:48,710 --> 01:12:58,670
So like early life stress related stress as would have stress biology and that that's the pathway through which in fact.

590
01:13:01,380 --> 01:13:05,950
So that's why I need to pull out which contract here we're talking about.

591
01:13:05,950 --> 01:13:12,700
But the stress is impacting their biology prenatally that they have.

592
01:13:13,420 --> 01:13:20,430
That's a pathway by early stress. Child biology said that there would be an intermediate variable.

593
01:13:22,650 --> 01:13:27,760
And then here. It's more just like to this model this would be more about.

594
01:13:28,630 --> 01:13:37,060
A behavioral pathway. So if I wanted to, I would split that part of biology and behavior and say that stress goes back to biology,

595
01:13:37,060 --> 01:13:41,140
to that of biology, which in turn is what we stress.

596
01:13:41,990 --> 01:13:51,420
His behavior. Unable to do sleep bedtime routines or have family is therefore resulting do self-pity worse than that.

597
01:13:53,700 --> 01:13:58,800
So it's a complicated that's what I was also thinking. It's a big picture.

598
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:05,630
Theoretical model. Conceptual model. Not this festival and this other one.

599
01:14:07,110 --> 01:14:10,950
Is a little more straight forward because the constructs are kind of.

600
01:14:12,430 --> 01:14:16,149
Tiger. Yes.

601
01:14:16,150 --> 01:14:20,740
Right. Oh, no, it's not. And this is like totally just to kind of play around.

602
01:14:21,130 --> 01:14:25,540
But yeah, so we try to do it because I think it's like just kind of fun to think through.

603
01:14:25,540 --> 01:14:36,240
Like, Oh, you're my circle. And like that they might get together, you know, like things that you should be involved with and say, like, oh.

604
01:14:41,570 --> 01:14:47,320
So that's what you're. Phenomena or something that happens.

605
01:14:47,330 --> 01:14:50,960
Yeah. That were predicted. And then what you could do too if you wanted to like start.

606
01:14:52,910 --> 01:14:57,470
That's what you're predicting depending on what you're interested in. Think the exposure.

607
01:14:58,170 --> 01:15:05,720
So what's your exposure? So here just going to be like, thanks for.

608
01:15:27,820 --> 01:15:35,450
It might be helpful. Joining.

609
01:15:37,830 --> 01:15:44,600
Jobs that depend on. Whether center.

610
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:51,310
It's like a dark day. Although it seemed to.

611
01:16:10,570 --> 01:16:14,010
Yeah. Look at look at how this going.

612
01:16:19,150 --> 01:16:25,960
He an example? I'm going to say anything.

613
01:16:27,260 --> 01:16:34,220
It's done. And then you have to operationalize that.

614
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:41,760
You know. And here the kicker.

615
01:16:42,130 --> 01:16:48,630
Yes. I like the that that's what I think is nice about about it together.

616
01:16:50,630 --> 01:16:59,010
I mean, I like. In a sense, they had access to the questions they tried to help with.

617
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:07,650
Valentina. It's there.

618
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:14,130
These models can kind of translate to a lot of different.

619
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:25,350
It's just things that I like. I think what's helpful.

620
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:32,780
Kind of like that. And then. As you said, just of.

621
01:17:35,650 --> 01:17:39,730
29 years ago. Article 40.

622
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:48,700
That's what you don't like. That's why you're from strapped to this point year on year.

623
01:17:51,690 --> 01:17:56,430
Okay. And then shot and I pulled up this flight to this.

624
01:17:58,750 --> 01:18:04,160
I don't just get caught in this. So it's that idea of.

625
01:18:05,690 --> 01:18:11,580
You want to try to give me a level of income here and I can go back to that.

626
01:18:14,710 --> 01:18:18,790
And so if you're you can have a very, very open as people have.

627
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:30,590
Thankfully. Name's. You just have said like three things.

628
01:18:31,170 --> 01:18:34,200
This experience is more like a Spanish thing.

629
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:40,460
That's. And then life like that may be a place where also.

630
01:18:42,620 --> 01:18:46,810
Questioning how am going to operationalize this American operation by the.

631
01:18:47,910 --> 01:18:51,550
Different ways. And that's why we get.

632
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:05,650
So that's your concern and. And what?

633
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:11,760
In this white Internet space. That's a moderator variable.

634
01:19:15,940 --> 01:19:30,470
Explain. I feel like there's someone here.

635
01:19:32,220 --> 01:19:47,190
I know. I'm a about the practitioner.

636
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:51,100
A practitioner on the practitioner. Right?

637
01:19:51,770 --> 01:19:56,970
Yeah. 20 years of painful.

638
01:19:59,900 --> 01:20:05,330
Mr. Smith. That's.

639
01:20:15,340 --> 01:20:21,620
For someone to. Plans to.

640
01:20:22,610 --> 01:20:36,420
Unless. Do you think of this?

641
01:20:37,190 --> 01:20:42,470
And so to me, it is something, you know.

642
01:20:43,940 --> 01:20:49,550
And even if we come to this kind of like floating out there, it. I think.

643
01:20:51,460 --> 01:20:56,410
Some of them, you know? Yeah, it's sort of an artificial breakdown, but it's helpful and.

644
01:21:00,630 --> 01:21:03,710
Yeah. So that's one factor.

645
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:08,920
And then I'm of to see.

646
01:21:10,590 --> 01:21:15,280
Where's the. So.

647
01:21:24,060 --> 01:21:31,970
Yeah. Just. Something.

648
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:11,650
Unofficially, that's. Well to that. Earlier.

649
01:22:11,700 --> 01:22:28,780
Yeah, I did, but. We're not.

650
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:52,090
The bad. Public health literacy.

651
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:05,030
I hope for the working.

652
01:23:14,770 --> 01:23:18,140
Because to me it's. This.

653
01:23:19,980 --> 01:23:23,480
Create an environment that's very easy to deploy.

654
01:23:24,250 --> 01:23:28,540
Health care. And these are more barriers that.

655
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:34,630
In the movies. I've done prostate cancer until kind of like. A mother.

656
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:38,520
He's making it even more difficult or slowing down.

657
01:23:50,430 --> 01:23:54,270
Yes, I know. This is my friend, and it's really fun.

658
01:24:14,150 --> 01:24:26,030
Somehow. Plus some of the projects that were done before I looked at it.

659
01:24:27,250 --> 01:24:30,970
This is because they would measure. Well, there's a.

660
01:24:32,430 --> 01:24:36,020
This has been on. And at the same.

661
01:24:46,680 --> 01:24:50,640
That is also, I think, Kaiser Health.

662
01:24:57,020 --> 01:25:04,660
An ideal. Hold tight in the hands of doctors and health community.

663
01:25:07,270 --> 01:25:15,120
Is that? Yeah, but I was.

664
01:25:37,550 --> 01:25:40,550
So I guess the part that I have to.

665
01:25:42,570 --> 01:25:52,350
It's like it's like a doctor patient relationship. You have a little bubble and then it's out of this community and then health care.

666
01:25:58,820 --> 01:26:03,440
And then. And be careful.

667
01:26:06,170 --> 01:26:12,010
This idea of a. And now is the time.

668
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:21,210
And then as communities. That's all of that is, I guess.

669
01:26:21,390 --> 01:26:25,350
I mean, the thing that I want to look at how. I personally.

670
01:26:36,730 --> 01:26:41,650
I my. Yeah.

671
01:26:41,660 --> 01:26:45,020
And actually, when you said. Stressing on in.

672
01:26:49,420 --> 01:26:52,540
MODERATOR. I'm just thinking that the moderator.

673
01:26:53,850 --> 01:26:59,270
So then what would be this? Well in that case.

674
01:27:00,240 --> 01:27:04,800
The exposure could the pictures that.

675
01:27:06,070 --> 01:27:13,630
Keyboard. Besides the health care practitioners.

676
01:27:19,770 --> 01:27:25,020
That is an interesting thing. So you have this sort of thing that this should work.

677
01:27:27,740 --> 01:27:31,140
Japan. I'd like to rethink.

678
01:27:31,990 --> 01:27:38,210
Community supports and health care. Perhaps health insurance and.

679
01:27:40,220 --> 01:27:45,670
Access. For the future of the health care system.

680
01:27:49,820 --> 01:28:07,670
And actually. There are models with electrification.

681
01:28:19,690 --> 01:28:29,490
Insults. For people who have had.

682
01:28:30,670 --> 01:29:04,180
Yes, it does. Yes.

683
01:29:04,180 --> 01:29:12,170
The voters might be really good. Nine.

684
01:29:17,700 --> 01:29:21,100
Where does the. Where does this?

685
01:29:24,540 --> 01:29:32,230
Where does restaurant stress? Yeah.

686
01:29:35,830 --> 01:29:42,220
Not to be an honorary. Yeah.

687
01:29:42,280 --> 01:29:46,220
There's not a clear model running their whole thing.

688
01:29:49,690 --> 01:30:11,670
Sometimes they would call him. But I say, Oh.

689
01:30:15,290 --> 01:30:18,380
Health and health care system.

690
01:30:27,150 --> 01:30:33,390
I think. That was just priest.

691
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:41,810
But then one. Like this.

692
01:30:41,940 --> 01:30:45,830
Exactly right. In New Jersey. Yes.

693
01:30:46,100 --> 01:30:53,170
We're just trying to I don't know how I found it the first time. Yeah.

694
01:30:53,180 --> 01:30:59,010
So it's a complicated. You could also.

695
01:30:59,870 --> 01:31:03,660
They don't have an African-American sample area on that.

696
01:31:04,330 --> 01:31:07,520
Right. But then there's the idea that. See.

697
01:31:09,140 --> 01:31:12,710
It gets to the heart of heart rate. It's like.

698
01:31:21,100 --> 01:31:26,860
I think what you're going through is like you can't measure causality.

699
01:31:31,880 --> 01:31:57,560
This past week. Only the. So then there was a way to translate all of these other things through to resources and help the seniors.

700
01:31:58,720 --> 01:32:11,400
Apples with apples without. Feels kind of like a first level question.

701
01:32:11,610 --> 01:32:18,650
Yeah. Yeah.

702
01:32:18,940 --> 01:32:32,700
Like thinking about it. Like if I had. And.

703
01:32:35,500 --> 01:32:46,770
And maybe this does become. This in a person is not an individual that's just been protected.

704
01:32:50,810 --> 01:32:58,030
Two. I'd like to treat. Practitioner trailing around a little bit.

705
01:32:58,070 --> 01:33:07,500
But this. More of this.

706
01:33:12,450 --> 01:33:16,290
It's like cultural misunderstandings, like the interaction with the.

707
01:33:24,540 --> 01:33:28,410
American. I want to.

708
01:33:35,730 --> 01:33:41,540
Here's. That could be true.

709
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:45,090
You can see the direct interaction.

710
01:33:50,140 --> 01:33:59,500
These factors to look the multiple. Because of my physical or like environmental, etc.

711
01:34:04,330 --> 01:34:10,360
I would like to. I assure you that the health care.

712
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:23,650
And I was interested in an understanding of the process. There is less engagement that goes into that.

713
01:34:24,630 --> 01:34:30,600
Here. As the South American.

714
01:34:36,670 --> 01:34:42,870
I might have a lesson. And.

715
01:34:47,360 --> 01:34:50,700
Experienced. Right now.

716
01:34:53,180 --> 01:34:56,680
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

717
01:34:57,040 --> 01:35:01,470
So, yeah. No, it's complicated. And I think it's like they're pursuing, like.

718
01:35:03,410 --> 01:35:09,110
Which. The fear mongering.

719
01:35:17,890 --> 01:35:28,500
The moderators. I want to return to the lake at least 110 miles.

720
01:35:30,240 --> 01:35:33,750
Do you think it could have been your life?

721
01:35:35,250 --> 01:35:41,790
Is it. Is it. You know, people who are African-American but not experiences that don't endorse this are happening.

722
01:35:42,940 --> 01:35:46,040
There's a low level versus a high level right now that.

723
01:35:47,430 --> 01:35:51,240
Next week, we're going to have a split in that room.

724
01:35:52,310 --> 01:35:56,790
Just sort of say, oh. You know everybody in my sample that.

725
01:35:58,530 --> 01:36:04,260
Variability in this area. Really high experience.

726
01:36:07,380 --> 01:36:11,700
And some people say long experience and only among.

727
01:36:12,720 --> 01:36:18,350
I experience that they have. U.S. health literacy.

728
01:36:19,860 --> 01:36:25,400
Methane. I was just thinking because it's different, right?

729
01:36:25,480 --> 01:36:36,620
Because of these. In the background variable, but I feel like it maybe like that interaction in the moment is bad at this.

730
01:36:36,980 --> 01:36:54,900
I feel like this. Maybe it's bad. Experience.

731
01:36:56,440 --> 01:36:59,450
Would you be like sort of a precursor, but then.

732
01:37:04,500 --> 01:37:09,000
Yeah. Yeah I look at that in the moment. I think I think almost that it's been sorted out.

733
01:37:15,460 --> 01:37:19,900
Yeah. Yeah, definitely. We were so far.

734
01:37:22,760 --> 01:37:25,790
Here, Sue. So what do you do?

735
01:37:26,680 --> 01:37:30,180
Yeah. Well, so then we experience time. Yeah.

736
01:37:34,490 --> 01:37:44,640
Literature Review of greatest. An actual serious.

737
01:37:59,800 --> 01:38:03,210
Tonight. Use that. This has.

738
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:09,410
With absolute rights in this space.

739
01:38:09,860 --> 01:38:17,060
The first thing that I think that all sit down to that individual level again like to have.

740
01:38:19,750 --> 01:38:30,450
Saved your sanity for seniors. Yeah.

741
01:38:30,450 --> 01:38:36,570
But then actually then they're like, I can't turn that. I think, yeah, that's.

742
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:55,100
I can hear that. I think this is more sensitive to.

743
01:38:57,630 --> 01:39:10,530
If you have higher. And I love that you have that model.

744
01:39:11,550 --> 01:39:17,900
That was. Nice to. Authorities are concerned by.

745
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:28,320
Yeah. I feel the way that the health care system is.

746
01:39:31,320 --> 01:39:46,480
Stepping out the. I was in the. And I think that that's a really great big conceptual model.

747
01:39:49,460 --> 01:39:54,710
That's kind of figuring out how works. Your family's like.

748
01:39:56,010 --> 01:39:59,920
Yeah. Testing the things so I can see.

749
01:40:03,040 --> 01:40:10,959
And this came out this past week. I you have to be able to do the right thing.

750
01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:15,340
And we landed on the premise that where.

751
01:40:22,350 --> 01:40:28,079
Like your favorite winter sport.

752
01:40:28,080 --> 01:40:36,860
That lady. And the idea. Hopeful humility is there for you.

753
01:40:37,330 --> 01:40:42,620
Yeah, that's. Yeah, that, I think.

754
01:40:49,220 --> 01:40:52,840
But that's right. There's so many different levels that are just.

755
01:40:55,760 --> 01:40:59,600
And I wonder if. Because I think we also know.

756
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:08,290
But they do make me like the appearance and some people to.

757
01:41:10,670 --> 01:41:19,200
And like health. We love.

758
01:41:21,510 --> 01:41:29,570
Yeah, the individual has. I'm not sure where that.

759
01:41:35,230 --> 01:41:38,500
Yeah. I mean, think about it. Here's how to do.

760
01:41:44,830 --> 01:41:50,310
And that is the thing that always kept this guy who had nothing that I want.

761
01:41:53,680 --> 01:41:57,200
And it's like he wasn't thinking, like. This is.

762
01:41:57,200 --> 01:42:04,650
This is like. True for an individual. This is not like that.

763
01:42:05,220 --> 01:42:10,990
Experience is not. That's true.

764
01:42:11,050 --> 01:42:14,830
Yeah. You still have extreme. Yeah. Not bad.

765
01:42:18,340 --> 01:42:22,120
Health care experts here say that this sets the stage.

766
01:42:24,220 --> 01:42:28,620
Providers in their. They were good. I think it would help people.

767
01:42:28,680 --> 01:42:32,130
It's almost like a country. Yeah. It's like. It's such a. It's such a relevant.

768
01:42:34,270 --> 01:42:39,390
In the business sector. This is another area.

769
01:42:40,650 --> 01:42:51,330
Right. And like you can also like if you're living in a community that has limited health care access and paid providers, that certainly.

770
01:42:52,570 --> 01:42:58,850
Interpretation of life. I'm having. Increase in stressors.

771
01:43:00,110 --> 01:43:03,629
Because I see healthcare as a, you know, like, yeah, so complex.

772
01:43:03,630 --> 01:43:07,620
But yeah, you're like tuning into this phase.

773
01:43:08,360 --> 01:43:11,750
It feels like. Yeah that sort of having a lot of other concerns on.

774
01:43:13,310 --> 01:43:16,640
Like literally. And then you're like, okay, this is the space.

775
01:43:19,930 --> 01:43:25,330
You know how these people work together. And then the governor person.

776
01:43:27,650 --> 01:43:34,500
And what's a preexisting? It's like what each person is telling.

777
01:43:45,240 --> 01:43:50,130
I think that's what we like to think you're good at.

778
01:43:50,400 --> 01:43:53,490
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

779
01:43:55,410 --> 01:44:02,070
That's a great not a good view of the future. I've got a few slides.

780
01:44:06,900 --> 01:44:24,670
That's 100%. Yeah. There's a hole in the wall.

781
01:44:25,150 --> 01:44:30,520
And so I feel like I first approached this from the very.

782
01:44:31,400 --> 01:44:37,670
The science background. You're not.

783
01:44:39,770 --> 01:44:43,590
Like is in the black box. Yeah. So I don't know.

784
01:44:43,660 --> 01:44:47,410
I don't know where to go. Yeah.

785
01:44:47,900 --> 01:45:00,980
Or was that. This is a very.

786
01:45:10,220 --> 01:45:16,020
So this is definitely like. And that's where I find the last four years since been.

787
01:45:17,440 --> 01:45:21,440
I get. Starting. That's what I thought.

788
01:45:22,010 --> 01:45:25,120
I don't know where this is.

789
01:45:27,720 --> 01:45:52,440
But thinking about the third line of how. Our man is one.

790
01:45:57,660 --> 01:46:01,930
Had some. Wanted on this one.

791
01:46:09,910 --> 01:46:19,470
We're going to have. Million users of services.

792
01:46:30,250 --> 01:46:36,460
It seems to me that. So that's where.

793
01:46:39,340 --> 01:46:45,210
I became more like. I think that.

794
01:47:00,610 --> 01:47:15,370
So far, no. Like not have a diagnosed.

795
01:47:39,720 --> 01:47:43,670
I like the idea. Even if. It's funny because I think there.

796
01:47:53,590 --> 01:47:58,990
These are really. But now spoken.

797
01:48:02,600 --> 01:48:11,670
There's a community of mental health. That feels like.

798
01:48:23,750 --> 01:48:30,740
You look at it through the lens. We feel that.

799
01:48:34,940 --> 01:48:38,070
The studio. You think that?

800
01:48:45,840 --> 01:48:53,560
Typical. Yeah. Our. In the last year we have seen.

801
01:48:59,780 --> 01:49:10,340
Character. That's what I feel like all of these to get are also.

802
01:49:23,230 --> 01:49:28,720
He's put all this. Mental health her.

803
01:49:36,020 --> 01:49:54,940
That's like being. They asked about family.

804
01:50:03,430 --> 01:50:11,470
Well, that's not true because it has. Well, Professor.

805
01:50:11,760 --> 01:50:15,340
So. Community College as well.

806
01:50:19,060 --> 01:50:24,760
I'm also. Right.

807
01:50:25,060 --> 01:51:11,750
Yeah, I think I, i they go. Yeah, I know.

808
01:51:11,860 --> 01:51:33,780
That sounds interesting. So this is trying to.

809
01:51:39,780 --> 01:51:53,280
And. Looking at.

810
01:51:55,080 --> 01:51:58,910
Community college students. It's a large.

811
01:52:02,540 --> 01:52:11,160
So we like comparing the Washington establishment to. And you saw his contacts.

812
01:52:17,190 --> 01:52:31,040
I think that I think that for. Well, I definitely think looking at that comparison that you just said.

813
01:52:33,390 --> 01:52:40,420
Immunity is. Like most minded people.

814
01:52:50,580 --> 01:52:56,230
And. In this.

815
01:53:07,010 --> 01:53:10,280
Community is interesting, but we didn't like that particular question.

816
01:53:37,670 --> 01:53:44,910
The tables, which could be kind of nice and. I love your house because.

817
01:53:49,970 --> 01:53:56,200
Variability because their ability to vary. I know that there is.

818
01:53:56,530 --> 01:54:02,450
But at the same time. So you think?

819
01:54:04,290 --> 01:54:07,710
Students as he was going, Where are you now?

820
01:54:08,820 --> 01:54:13,380
And I like that question of like comparing this three school old.

821
01:54:19,300 --> 01:54:27,980
It's like being. There was a scene.

822
01:54:31,110 --> 01:54:34,530
You're going to be the family will be the same.

823
01:54:38,220 --> 01:54:42,390
You're in status and all these other things. You know.

824
01:54:57,960 --> 01:55:02,270
Syringes. They're meant to serve.

825
01:55:03,550 --> 01:55:12,300
Community college students. So.

826
01:55:21,100 --> 01:55:25,550
This is a super interesting policy. It was really good stuff.

827
01:55:26,700 --> 01:56:00,560
Well, now it depends who. I've thought a.

828
01:56:03,870 --> 01:56:16,320
And. They have.

829
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:24,230
Well, the. With nine.

830
01:56:28,490 --> 01:56:36,460
Like Phenix. Yeah, yeah, like that. But then they had a pool and it was small, but it was.

831
01:56:46,050 --> 01:56:51,840
Right, right, right, right, right, right. It would have to be like.

832
01:56:53,200 --> 01:56:57,999
And let's try to figure out. Yeah.

833
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:03,530
I mean, I think that that probably. I.

834
01:57:13,920 --> 01:57:19,170
Got wonder that. Yeah, I think that's like.

835
01:57:20,640 --> 01:57:26,530
I think that's like, yeah, that's true. L.A. Without making it the first level question.

836
01:57:27,690 --> 01:57:32,600
Paris. No. We don't have a problem solving.

837
01:57:36,040 --> 01:57:44,320
Or just, you know. Identify.

838
01:57:52,260 --> 01:58:01,290
Asia. I have to tell.

839
01:58:17,260 --> 01:58:27,930
This is the same impact of the community college. It's all really bad.

840
01:58:31,350 --> 01:58:34,690
Well, it isn't just. I got daughter in.

841
01:58:36,750 --> 01:58:43,250
Versus. Hard.

842
01:58:43,370 --> 01:58:47,660
That's really, you know. Understanding the.

843
01:58:50,760 --> 01:58:53,070
Just like him to know that, plus the state.

844
01:58:53,160 --> 01:59:02,210
So there's a lot of news like Felix's like her tax dollars from her coffee shop for not telling her I would like it just because.

845
01:59:03,030 --> 01:59:11,690
These are some. The school is providing.

846
01:59:15,750 --> 01:59:30,100
That feels like you had a lot. I don't know what.

847
01:59:32,930 --> 01:59:43,320
Yeah. Yeah. Yea, yea. The Community College Board.

848
01:59:45,430 --> 02:00:04,300
Every. So that you guys get data.

849
02:00:10,920 --> 02:00:22,050
Having access to. Where? Advertising and information technology, community college directors.

850
02:00:22,870 --> 02:00:27,010
If you want to know what a campus like that.

851
02:00:41,170 --> 02:01:02,100
I don't want to give. Oh, this is my high school.

852
02:01:12,870 --> 02:01:18,320
Yeah. Knowing a lot about what that's worth. Yeah. It not enough.

853
02:01:19,760 --> 02:01:27,990
But the doctors say this is worse. Could it be good timing?

854
02:01:37,730 --> 02:01:44,160
And when you said the mental health landscape so that it's already fully integrated and also that.

855
02:01:50,230 --> 02:01:53,480
I thought my father's. What?

856
02:01:56,280 --> 02:02:01,480
The number of survivors or students. Okay.

857
02:02:01,810 --> 02:02:06,420
So you're getting out of that? Yeah. So, like, I lot. So that's why I was thinking.

858
02:02:12,180 --> 02:02:15,880
Oh. Yeah.

859
02:02:23,250 --> 02:02:34,910
I think I. So artists are figuring it out and healthy artists.

860
02:02:37,580 --> 02:02:40,610
So you are the maximum have been called a serious.

861
02:02:42,230 --> 02:02:52,050
So starting on Friday night, there used to be. Very.

862
02:02:54,600 --> 02:03:01,000
To do that, the schools had to. With our graphics.

863
02:03:02,140 --> 02:03:13,820
Substance abuse. And other models are even greater.

864
02:03:26,800 --> 02:03:37,120
Subscription plans are. When I started.

865
02:03:42,810 --> 02:03:46,180
Community colleges. School.

866
02:03:54,360 --> 02:03:59,700
Yeah. It's a very interesting life. Study design and that sort of thing.

867
02:04:00,980 --> 02:04:13,530
Mm. And it's bad for business because things are more or less like that.

868
02:04:15,920 --> 02:04:24,470
The Mile High city is really just another and of like the healthy minds that has some of that.

869
02:04:25,890 --> 02:04:31,090
They did in terms of how the. You're going.

870
02:04:42,500 --> 02:04:46,960
We're going to. Is that right? This is.

871
02:05:02,930 --> 02:05:15,840
That like it's hard to. Yes.

872
02:05:15,870 --> 02:05:19,220
That's an interesting insight that. Yeah.

873
02:05:21,320 --> 02:05:30,120
They're more heterogeneous within. That is if you.

874
02:05:34,690 --> 02:05:38,950
And. I think that.

875
02:05:42,770 --> 02:05:48,670
College type. Before. More incidents.

876
02:05:49,760 --> 02:05:58,840
You know, it's like when you're trying to create after. And then we get results that are like.

877
02:06:00,640 --> 02:06:05,690
Really? Yeah, exactly. So like that you have to have a little bit.

878
02:06:08,570 --> 02:06:16,300
Thought this was a group that, like, they're actually interested. Headquarters.

879
02:06:34,980 --> 02:06:40,470
Right. And I.

880
02:06:42,730 --> 02:06:46,980
I know you guys doing it. Are you one of the.

881
02:06:50,270 --> 02:06:55,520
Yeah. I've never been there before.

882
02:06:55,520 --> 02:06:58,550
So he was like, okay.

883
02:07:00,140 --> 02:07:09,840
I have this exact word I can do you I to figure it out because you have six different options.

884
02:07:12,370 --> 02:07:25,510
What are. So you don't want to go? Like what are the implications of selecting this first download of new packaging the that we have.

885
02:07:30,280 --> 02:07:38,650
That's not to go back and forth across the in our sitting together looking to do something with that action.

886
02:07:39,430 --> 02:07:46,020
Yeah. Yeah. Well, let's see if this doesn't do it.

887
02:07:46,050 --> 02:07:49,710
Oh, sorry. Yeah, this is for. Thank you. Can I ask a question?

888
02:07:50,610 --> 02:07:54,090
So for my presentation, why focus on the.

889
02:07:55,450 --> 02:08:11,750
Sort of like. I mean that like you're saying, you know, I did.

890
02:08:15,870 --> 02:08:22,610
I kind of I don't know any of the characters in high school I there and I tried.

891
02:08:25,840 --> 02:08:29,630
I don't know that it. At first it.

892
02:08:34,640 --> 02:08:44,380
I didn't expect. I think you're quite right so far.

893
02:08:59,260 --> 02:09:03,560
It was used as a way to get to the transfer of everything.

894
02:09:04,050 --> 02:09:09,640
Super three. Now is a great time to be in the pandemic and.

895
02:09:10,240 --> 02:09:14,530
The students are talking about them on their right now. And I think that's great.

896
02:09:14,530 --> 02:09:19,090
But. And part of the reason for this.

897
02:09:19,610 --> 02:09:23,500
Sort of name on the menu is very far into your basic profit.

898
02:09:27,060 --> 02:09:40,390
Yeah. Yeah. That person says that they know now that.

899
02:09:42,720 --> 02:09:47,380
So much better and so much more organized. Your life, I think.

900
02:09:49,100 --> 02:09:56,210
And just talking to people. A lot of people I like that I can tell you each person you that track record.

901
02:09:57,620 --> 02:10:04,030
But yeah like I think it and I have. And.

902
02:10:05,010 --> 02:10:09,400
There are so many technologies that. Obvious ways, but also.

903
02:10:11,820 --> 02:10:19,840
That's were. And. Certainly.

904
02:10:22,140 --> 02:10:30,230
The stuff. It's just great to be here.

905
02:10:31,760 --> 02:10:49,170
Someone has. Says It's very.

906
02:11:01,360 --> 02:11:04,510
Can you can you be more specific?

907
02:11:09,490 --> 02:11:14,150
Is that right? Can you please.

908
02:11:16,030 --> 02:11:22,969
Entirely. But you bad talk about her like you did.

909
02:11:22,970 --> 02:11:29,490
Start reading. After you get into socialism, you start. You start, you started to like my brother Giuseppe.

910
02:11:29,490 --> 02:11:38,100
He just finished it last year, but the way that he made sure he was going to be in Mexico,

911
02:11:38,100 --> 02:11:42,810
so he didn't have to like research like what was going on, but he kind of did a friend of there automatically.

912
02:11:43,630 --> 02:11:50,110
And it was my uncle. And it was a singing concentration like that in our letters.

913
02:11:50,260 --> 02:11:55,780
And then. And this is kind of interesting for my family.

914
02:11:55,800 --> 02:12:03,430
They're English just like language immigrants. So it was like it was a way for them to avoid these as easy or decent.

915
02:12:04,830 --> 02:12:11,600
Still learning on the ground. And they've been pleased, you know, because they're.

916
02:12:21,040 --> 02:12:24,350
I mean, I like the girl with my number here.

917
02:12:24,880 --> 02:12:34,950
The. I didn't understand it better in that way.

918
02:12:35,040 --> 02:12:42,010
Like, once my husband got to my and even my cousin on the university level was kind of like, you're just expected to perform and you don't care.

919
02:12:42,100 --> 02:12:45,480
Kind of weird. Yeah, it isn't just I don't have time.

920
02:12:45,780 --> 02:12:49,650
Who are English or no English? Got to do it. So.

921
02:12:55,990 --> 02:13:03,570
Community is centered around. No.

922
02:13:11,250 --> 02:13:16,270
Considering how many people have. 60%.

923
02:13:25,790 --> 02:13:29,380
And I think that's where I to educate them about the gaps.

924
02:13:33,180 --> 02:13:44,710
It seems like that's a pretty. Research papers out there.

925
02:13:57,850 --> 02:14:07,820
He was a little bit. You guys went for a little break in the new forest.

926
02:14:08,440 --> 02:14:12,950
Oh, that's good. That time is as good as we could have done.

927
02:14:13,760 --> 02:14:21,530
Oh, yeah, we're. Oh, yeah.

928
02:14:21,550 --> 02:14:25,540
And then I can run through our little conceptual models to.

929
02:14:31,510 --> 02:14:35,800
Oh, questions? Yeah. Yeah. Like with these.

930
02:14:37,550 --> 02:14:44,110
Those. The policy piece of this is really just like a big piece of it that is often

931
02:14:44,110 --> 02:14:48,900
like really hard to fit in as much as heavy measures that hard to control.

932
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:54,600
That's. You think it's because such a model is more like.

933
02:14:56,470 --> 02:15:04,720
I feel like it is like often, yeah. Maybe a kind of a background or context variable that you're sort of thinking like this is also.

934
02:15:05,930 --> 02:15:11,420
A way to understand how. What the real world.

935
02:15:13,530 --> 02:15:21,350
Your variables are like not. I'm just thinking about, like, health care, like health care access.

936
02:15:23,120 --> 02:15:26,180
Under this policy right now. This.

937
02:15:29,200 --> 02:15:40,070
Range. But you can also say, like my proposed policy shows that the best predictor the moderator.

938
02:15:43,350 --> 02:15:47,890
We've made a policy change that everything's.

939
02:15:50,120 --> 02:15:54,250
Free tuition. Then how would that change?

940
02:15:56,890 --> 02:16:01,370
Is that what the parents doing for students that are different?

941
02:16:02,500 --> 02:16:08,710
Pretty much I. Is that an undergrad that's going to be going to Mexico?

942
02:16:09,360 --> 02:16:17,500
Why? I just signed it this year. It's like students went to a different public school and a different public school in the 90 seconds.

943
02:16:19,030 --> 02:16:22,189
How is your. Yeah. Yeah.

944
02:16:22,190 --> 02:16:29,650
There's, like, this kind of amazing statewide. The U.S. doesn't see them until it's South Built public school.

945
02:16:30,800 --> 02:16:36,490
It's also a school to raise rates.

946
02:16:38,460 --> 02:16:45,060
Yeah. Well, do we want to look at Clarence a little and then.

947
02:16:46,670 --> 02:16:52,730
Right? Yeah, my children. I feel like I'm gonna lose a lot of fun, cause I.

948
02:16:54,090 --> 02:17:01,790
Yeah, I feel like that. But I'm still kind of like.

949
02:17:01,790 --> 02:17:08,150
I have, like, this inner struggle going on. Like, you know, I just because I'm an expert in something and, like, how do I keep that?

950
02:17:08,990 --> 02:17:12,580
Like, I realized I heard or two.

951
02:17:13,610 --> 02:17:17,690
Or do I, like, switch that I when I feel like.

952
02:17:21,910 --> 02:17:29,350
I. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

953
02:17:29,820 --> 02:17:35,550
Definitely. I always like come back and the yeah we get that.

954
02:17:35,610 --> 02:17:42,790
Yeah. So I think the transitioning to living that is the importance of.

955
02:17:43,600 --> 02:17:53,070
I appreciate. Or you could just.

956
02:17:53,340 --> 02:18:00,770
Yeah, I would just say. Yeah. Poor mental function.

957
02:18:01,920 --> 02:18:06,480
Yeah. But if it's. If it's poor mental health.

958
02:18:09,890 --> 02:18:12,960
Well, kind of depends on the church. Yeah.

959
02:18:17,760 --> 02:18:21,030
And then the exposure is with super.

960
02:18:23,180 --> 02:18:34,200
Because there's, you know. I'm not sure that there's going to be somebody like my husband in prison, my grandson or so.

961
02:18:36,480 --> 02:18:41,610
There's usually a reason, right, you to try to avoid the certainty factor.

962
02:18:41,610 --> 02:18:50,540
So yeah. That could do like. My.

963
02:18:51,890 --> 02:19:00,810
Prosecution. The.

964
02:19:02,440 --> 02:19:11,690
Was actually what happened. Literally the whole.

965
02:19:27,810 --> 02:19:31,600
What you've had some pretty horrific policies. The average.

966
02:19:33,440 --> 02:19:40,250
And it's actually like a stage that. Policy does have a lot of options available.

967
02:19:46,440 --> 02:19:55,110
I just find the markets in Europe aimlessly just as an excuse as political.

968
02:19:55,230 --> 02:20:04,980
Yeah. There's such a lot of like humanity here, but this is just one example.

969
02:20:05,590 --> 02:20:12,600
I guess I think you're right. Like. Right.

970
02:20:12,610 --> 02:20:16,380
But those are not so pointed at that stage of the migration.

971
02:20:17,820 --> 02:20:21,150
Process the experience. And then once they're here.

972
02:20:25,330 --> 02:20:37,970
Because of this, probably. There's.

973
02:20:41,300 --> 02:20:46,210
I feel like prisoners. I like to. They qualified for.

974
02:21:14,990 --> 02:21:28,200
Acculturation. They might not like the political environment.

975
02:21:44,320 --> 02:21:47,979
From my personal experiences, like one of their jobs part before they came.

976
02:21:47,980 --> 02:21:58,020
And then they end up having. Maybe like socio economically this.

977
02:22:06,320 --> 02:22:10,190
Something. You have to do something else.

978
02:22:11,290 --> 02:22:22,110
Line trading. I.

979
02:22:22,860 --> 02:22:27,390
No, no. I mean, like like I like it's very like right out in this process, you have to.

980
02:22:27,720 --> 02:22:30,800
It's like you have. You know.

981
02:22:32,650 --> 02:22:35,790
Their process. All right.

982
02:22:36,110 --> 02:22:42,620
Yes. Print all about this chronology, but I haven't been able to I need to really focus on one piece of it because.

983
02:22:45,370 --> 02:22:53,660
Maybe. Like what? I think they're. Also like the fact that this maybe a certain demographic different.

984
02:22:55,060 --> 02:22:59,090
Yeah. I bet that will that will be.

985
02:22:59,660 --> 02:23:06,590
I kind of like where you are now like, you know probably what you end not being able to look at practicality.

986
02:23:07,070 --> 02:23:19,320
Right. That's true. I'm not sure. I just realized that I was going to say to you, this is just so obvious, but stress it from here on there right now.

987
02:23:19,580 --> 02:23:25,660
But but certainly that would be a pretty that would certainly be a reality all the way is.

988
02:23:25,680 --> 02:23:33,530
So I think like. Yeah. It's sort of like it's like a little call out, you know, so much about stress and trauma or mental functioning.

989
02:23:36,300 --> 02:23:42,209
And then one of my other. Just an observation in the field, you can kind of go either way.

990
02:23:42,210 --> 02:23:47,700
But right now, everything that's on there is pretty negative.

991
02:23:48,300 --> 02:23:51,920
Right? Yeah, you're right. And I wonder.

992
02:23:51,930 --> 02:23:58,110
Yeah, that would be strictly one of the things. I mean, it's a community, you know?

993
02:23:59,040 --> 02:24:02,580
No. People are any type of community social support.

994
02:24:04,640 --> 02:24:08,210
Just wondering if there. Yeah.

995
02:24:08,390 --> 02:24:17,600
Actors probably haven't had a lot. Suppose that those not her.

996
02:24:21,720 --> 02:24:24,750
Like you'd be protected from some of the negative screen.

997
02:24:27,300 --> 02:24:31,010
I notice. And then I think that's the question.

998
02:24:31,450 --> 02:24:33,730
The mental functioning of other people that.

999
02:24:37,140 --> 02:24:48,330
Due to the poor mental health condition or mental functioning, broadly speaking about the flourishing two, not flourishing or anything, you know.

1000
02:24:48,490 --> 02:24:53,370
Yeah. So I feel like that might allow you to sort of think about.

1001
02:25:06,240 --> 02:25:09,530
Yeah, it's a lot, but it's definitely.

1002
02:25:11,430 --> 02:25:16,360
Imagine a lot of questions coming. A different.

1003
02:25:22,470 --> 02:25:32,990
And the stuff that's going on and really part of being frustrated or feeling like the stuff that.

1004
02:25:38,880 --> 02:25:47,000
So over time the labor. Family Separation 2000.

1005
02:25:48,640 --> 02:25:59,950
Because there so. How brands and designs.

1006
02:26:01,890 --> 02:26:06,930
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1007
02:26:06,940 --> 02:26:11,020
I mean, I think in in terms of what you might be able to afford.

1008
02:26:11,080 --> 02:26:15,210
So I really like the idea of like folding in from the cancer.

1009
02:26:16,790 --> 02:26:20,060
If this one right now feels like a lot. All right.

1010
02:26:20,200 --> 02:26:27,610
Yeah. Is that is that like a different now coming to look at.

1011
02:26:29,010 --> 02:26:33,990
We could be like the wind and waves in here.

1012
02:26:34,100 --> 02:26:40,480
Look around. A lot of people have been my. And then there are be.

1013
02:26:41,710 --> 02:26:45,220
Probably some specifics, like health care access and other things.

1014
02:26:48,070 --> 02:26:51,450
But even then, they're happy to think about it.

1015
02:26:52,280 --> 02:26:56,109
Yeah, I'm thinking of that's like a separate model.

1016
02:26:56,110 --> 02:27:15,160
But mental health is. And is this like this, John?

1017
02:27:15,790 --> 02:27:21,810
We. Like, How might this?

1018
02:27:22,780 --> 02:27:28,530
Access to the. Yeah.

1019
02:27:28,580 --> 02:27:33,860
So I actually emailed him about this project and so he sent me some stuff to look at about this specific project.

1020
02:27:33,860 --> 02:27:38,410
So. Look at my. Consider that.

1021
02:27:41,180 --> 02:27:46,730
I think there's ways for. Yeah.

1022
02:27:47,010 --> 02:27:50,470
Now, are you talking about a meeting with them? That happened yesterday.

1023
02:27:50,540 --> 02:27:58,710
I was in class like many girls. I'm not sure who that is about. Okay.

1024
02:27:58,760 --> 02:28:03,480
So you can kind of familiarize yourself like with his, you know, people too.

1025
02:28:03,510 --> 02:28:08,040
I mean, it's funny because I really don't work with Don at all that he and I were in the hall yesterday.

1026
02:28:08,080 --> 02:28:15,649
One of his collaborators is actually done, for example, like young kids and indigenous populations.

1027
02:28:15,650 --> 02:28:20,690
And we just had like such a fascinating, great conversation with like, Oh, you're perfect, you're doing it now.

1028
02:28:20,750 --> 02:28:28,240
So it's, it's, yeah. So I think this is one of those good like conceptual models and put it up on the lines and think,

1029
02:28:28,580 --> 02:28:33,850
okay, where can I like chip away at different parts of it right over there.

1030
02:28:33,980 --> 02:28:45,230
That's true. Yeah. Yeah. And like the like because some of it that given your expertize to the to like even think about interviews methods approaches.

1031
02:28:45,230 --> 02:28:50,730
Right and. Pulling out some data that he has in mind is fascinating.

1032
02:28:51,630 --> 02:28:56,460
And or your past collaborators have you to have these kinds of data.

1033
02:28:58,380 --> 02:29:01,650
We were amazed by this, and we purposely did not.

1034
02:29:03,840 --> 02:29:08,480
They're not done to. But it came up a lot for.

1035
02:29:09,440 --> 02:29:12,630
Especially when they can have access to their cancer care.

1036
02:29:13,550 --> 02:29:21,820
Right. And it was a stressor and for providers to realize that there was something that very.

1037
02:29:23,740 --> 02:29:29,170
We can pull resources for those patients for. At the end, we had formed a committee.

1038
02:29:30,380 --> 02:29:36,460
We had. I mean, survivors and providers and videos.

1039
02:29:37,030 --> 02:29:43,580
And that was one of the main stresses for everybody was like training on how to to somebody or to assist.

1040
02:29:46,440 --> 02:29:50,270
I'm from. So that's kind of I would be another.

1041
02:29:51,620 --> 02:29:54,620
Yeah. Like, I don't know what other states have to be able to do.

1042
02:29:56,340 --> 02:30:00,380
It's a great question and I think creates. Yeah.

1043
02:30:02,660 --> 02:30:09,010
You might. Something under the perception phase.

1044
02:30:09,550 --> 02:30:12,610
Yeah. That was like going of course to.

1045
02:30:12,700 --> 02:30:18,880
But. Think about that. The Federation decided to.

1046
02:30:18,890 --> 02:30:22,670
Definitely. Deferred status? No.

1047
02:30:23,610 --> 02:30:28,220
Just like that. Yeah, that. That might just sort of like, read.

1048
02:30:32,820 --> 02:30:37,640
Thought. Right. That generation is what I feel like.

1049
02:30:38,810 --> 02:30:41,990
I feel like if you're saying, yeah, you're just chronological right now.

1050
02:30:42,210 --> 02:30:45,560
Yeah. Yeah. And like keeping it for the people.

1051
02:30:47,400 --> 02:30:53,850
But then. I mean, that's just the glare down there, but not like that.

1052
02:30:53,850 --> 02:31:02,700
Thinking about family separation and all of those things that impact, you know, like how do you provide for your partner?

1053
02:31:13,150 --> 02:31:20,910
But. And then look at that, this James.

1054
02:31:23,460 --> 02:31:27,970
The many married couple parents or sons or something, but.

1055
02:31:31,490 --> 02:31:34,850
This policy. And then they're done.

1056
02:31:35,430 --> 02:31:40,890
Yeah. And I would give you a hand to look at Queen.

1057
02:31:44,510 --> 02:31:49,580
Yeah. Separation.

1058
02:31:50,480 --> 02:32:01,170
I think it's kind of hard. In the school of Social Work.

1059
02:32:02,710 --> 02:32:06,720
It doesn't work too. But I know he went down. I can't wait to.

1060
02:32:09,260 --> 02:32:14,660
Just focus on family separation for Joe Ryan.

1061
02:32:14,780 --> 02:32:21,990
But because it's like. Social work.

1062
02:32:28,050 --> 02:32:31,470
It'll be interesting for you to keep in mind.

1063
02:32:34,020 --> 02:32:38,100
This is a round that you've found that might be able to speak to some of these.

1064
02:32:39,270 --> 02:32:43,650
Questions in terms of language, data, sources or access to.

1065
02:32:45,280 --> 02:32:48,940
Yeah. It's a really hard population, that's for sure.

1066
02:32:49,720 --> 02:32:54,480
Yeah. Yeah, I think they're gonna. Yeah.

1067
02:32:54,840 --> 02:32:58,240
There was that. Yeah.

1068
02:32:59,850 --> 02:33:05,580
And we had to make it was the first thing that we like to tell them upfront and when they're asked about that.

1069
02:33:05,760 --> 02:33:14,530
Yeah. We went through some. We just we we we kind of keep running into this issue.

1070
02:33:14,530 --> 02:33:17,079
And it's quite it's a very basic research thing,

1071
02:33:17,080 --> 02:33:24,129
like how do I pay participants to participate in a study and also justify that I paid them to the powers that be and then which is my back and forth,

1072
02:33:24,130 --> 02:33:28,360
back and forth. And I'm pretty numbers and I know we have to get them in.

1073
02:33:30,370 --> 02:33:34,479
Don't we have to get them? But you do have to get a dispensation that you don't.

1074
02:33:34,480 --> 02:33:43,870
And it's just. And then the other thing that was related to that was they wanted people to get gift card for like a credit card.

1075
02:33:44,130 --> 02:33:51,500
These are different. And so that can be good, but also it can be not visible.

1076
02:33:54,700 --> 02:33:59,100
There's all sorts of things that come up around this very concrete issue, like how do you create bridges?

1077
02:34:03,580 --> 02:34:06,810
Our first line managers have meaningful discussions with my family.

1078
02:34:07,750 --> 02:34:08,780
University of Michigan.

1079
02:34:08,800 --> 02:34:17,290
It deals with like millions of dollars of subject payments available on a like how can I come to you for cash from a transplant for the same time,

1080
02:34:17,290 --> 02:34:22,860
like you said was probably. Yeah.

1081
02:34:23,200 --> 02:34:24,100
You have to figure this out.

1082
02:34:24,130 --> 02:34:31,960
So they had a lot of if I think of the people like better coast to coast and also from that, you know, I guess I was going to say more.

1083
02:34:31,990 --> 02:34:35,560
So I think there's there's a pediatrics pediatric group.

1084
02:34:37,310 --> 02:34:48,810
I think killing or injure is. Who's working on like, you know, from a child perspective, but like refugee children.

1085
02:34:50,620 --> 02:34:53,770
Michigan and several times that might be.

1086
02:34:53,980 --> 02:35:01,880
That's not the first thing I think. There's sort of a pediatric brain tumor focuses on physicians and of course, we see them kids coming.

1087
02:35:02,090 --> 02:35:06,540
But yeah. So that's obviously.

1088
02:35:18,960 --> 02:35:25,370
You see? Thank you for.

1089
02:35:41,650 --> 02:35:57,410
Right. So fascinating. Sure. I want to.

1090
02:36:07,480 --> 02:36:11,000
We have an that been. Very curious about that.

1091
02:36:13,980 --> 02:36:20,740
I've known that through my. We will care for your.

1092
02:36:27,900 --> 02:36:31,390
Say that again so you can have a look at populations of cancer.

1093
02:36:39,090 --> 02:36:52,160
Thank you. Be within reach yet.

1094
02:36:52,220 --> 02:36:56,630
Keep that cancer through my head. You say you want your expertize.

1095
02:36:57,040 --> 02:37:06,800
Look, I do. I think that his view.

1096
02:37:09,920 --> 02:37:13,610
That just feels scary to me.

1097
02:37:14,210 --> 02:37:20,810
And as a transition point, too, it's like, okay, you know, you're this new man and helping out kids.

1098
02:37:20,810 --> 02:37:26,770
And how do they relate to that? Yeah. Relationship.

1099
02:37:30,440 --> 02:37:34,480
It's a whole other kind of.

1100
02:37:35,170 --> 02:37:37,710
Yeah. Yeah. And like it, you're kind of, you know,

1101
02:37:37,730 --> 02:37:43,810
thinking about a lot of models like that for its own mental health functioning, you know, and cancer is an example.

1102
02:37:44,680 --> 02:37:57,090
You know, that person can take that. But in that kind of space, like where you're focusing in any given part of your research, you can feel.

1103
02:37:57,640 --> 02:38:09,500
Two different stages of migration. She was an alcoholic in a way that I think would be probably hard pressed to think of how

1104
02:38:09,670 --> 02:38:15,120
someone not that are like brain health related outcomes and not active at some level.

1105
02:38:15,370 --> 02:38:28,350
Right. Right. That's right. Let's get this.

1106
02:38:28,420 --> 02:38:35,799
Yeah, I think it's like five. Six are helpful to run through all this with everybody's ideas.

1107
02:38:35,800 --> 02:38:41,290
So I know. Let's see. I mean, uh, midterm electorate.

1108
02:38:41,410 --> 02:38:44,620
Okay, we have a few minutes. Let me just.

1109
02:38:44,950 --> 02:38:51,220
Oh, yeah, well, you get your off for sure. Do you, like, go to John and be like, this is my plan?

1110
02:38:55,620 --> 02:39:00,940
Um. We can discuss this mediator stuff.

1111
02:39:01,600 --> 02:39:13,930
I was just going to click through a few, but some of these examples that just have us thinking about the moderation and we can we can also do this.

1112
02:39:15,450 --> 02:39:24,480
I can do this next time. Let me see. Yeah, we can.

1113
02:39:24,930 --> 02:39:30,300
I said we can just go for. But why don't we do that, I think.

1114
02:39:30,630 --> 02:39:36,330
But as well, we're thinking of, like, this big complexity thing and then zooming back into, like, how do we test this?

1115
02:39:36,960 --> 02:39:49,650
This is these directed, directed crafts or this DAG models, which is just the like they don't they're not recursive.

1116
02:39:50,860 --> 02:39:53,910
There. So that that will eventually.

1117
02:39:54,180 --> 02:39:59,670
But it can't be a closed loop. Like you have to have things moving forward to the predictors and you can't have things.

1118
02:40:03,410 --> 02:40:12,799
You know, bi directionally. And so this is just like a further kind of break down example of this type of conceptual model.

1119
02:40:12,800 --> 02:40:22,070
But I think these models can be helpful when you're really trying to think through like, what's my research question and hypothesis?

1120
02:40:22,070 --> 02:40:25,100
So I change this.

1121
02:40:25,370 --> 02:40:27,450
How is it affecting that? That has an impact.

1122
02:40:27,710 --> 02:40:35,510
So this is sort of where we start to interface with our statistical modeling and the capacities that we're using in the statistics.

1123
02:40:37,180 --> 02:40:40,940
And. I probably don't.

1124
02:40:42,770 --> 02:40:48,700
We need to talk extensively about those. But that term, I feel like, is coming up increasingly in public health.

1125
02:40:48,710 --> 02:40:58,350
And I think it's actually really from like systems approaches and systems science because people know like.

1126
02:40:59,010 --> 02:41:09,950
In this complex, bi directional world. But like, how do we force things into a testable model that can can be can be done?

1127
02:41:09,960 --> 02:41:13,080
So I think what actually with each of your guys.

1128
02:41:14,050 --> 02:41:20,350
Question. I think you could kind of force it forces a subset of those questions into a simpler model.

1129
02:41:20,350 --> 02:41:29,440
And that's like a good way to think about like a project for the of Justin's class or like a paper or a kind of specific research.

1130
02:41:29,440 --> 02:41:33,700
Question How can you sort of fit it into this model?

1131
02:41:33,700 --> 02:41:34,340
That sort of.

1132
02:41:37,990 --> 02:41:46,870
We don't want to allow the bi directionality creep in, even if it means maybe they're like, you know, you in this very one directional way.

1133
02:41:49,520 --> 02:41:54,300
And I think this was kind of a good read on these these models.

1134
02:41:56,830 --> 02:42:12,340
And yeah, I think when you see the other ones I thought we could that I usually kind of go through here's that thing that variables.

1135
02:42:16,660 --> 02:42:20,440
This year, I can just see.

1136
02:42:22,670 --> 02:42:27,469
And I feel like we can do this next time. Actually, why don't we pause on this?

1137
02:42:27,470 --> 02:42:30,560
Because I feel like we can just cut through these examples, but.

1138
02:42:33,810 --> 02:42:41,139
These examples are from. From these different opinions.

1139
02:42:41,140 --> 02:42:50,530
What is going all. But.

1140
02:42:55,800 --> 02:42:59,100
Great analysis of the general attitudes.

1141
02:42:59,100 --> 02:43:06,500
One. That has moderators and staff and the basic needs.

1142
02:43:07,820 --> 02:43:12,390
Everyone. The. So we can go through that.

1143
02:43:14,010 --> 02:43:20,980
This is kind of. Now show me the working theory examples of what's going on later.

1144
02:43:24,510 --> 02:43:28,900
Because we got to go through a lot of your guys, mothers. So.

1145
02:43:30,880 --> 02:43:37,440
Yeah. Why don't you? And I just make a note to switch these guys over until next time.

1146
02:43:38,330 --> 02:43:44,750
And I will have for your presentation and.

1147
02:43:48,320 --> 02:43:58,000
You. What would you prefer?

1148
02:44:00,710 --> 02:44:04,120
We would love that if you want to pick up where we.

1149
02:44:05,110 --> 02:44:12,239
Well, at the very least. And then. Yeah.

1150
02:44:12,240 --> 02:44:18,639
Why don't we do that? And then you just sort of like. Specific examples of mediator.

1151
02:44:18,640 --> 02:44:27,120
MODERATOR. And then one that's a tiny bit more complicated and then that'll be helpful, hopefully.

1152
02:44:28,650 --> 02:44:40,280
Yeah. And actually, Amy, this the third one that we can talk about is like more of an implementation study and one that was done here in person.

1153
02:44:40,560 --> 02:44:44,000
Know it's a different person. Oh, okay. I'm just going to love that.

1154
02:44:46,430 --> 02:44:52,390
Yeah, that's. Cool. Cool to take that as an article.

1155
02:44:53,500 --> 02:44:58,630
They're quite good at that concept. But to wrap things up, is that okay?

1156
02:44:58,810 --> 02:45:05,440
That's fine. I think it's mostly also in the vein of getting you guys started start comics.

1157
02:45:06,850 --> 02:45:18,040
So that if we want to have fun and that's quite nice, broad ideas so that we can look at the article as a background.

1158
02:45:18,070 --> 02:45:28,410
But, you know, we don't need to. Yeah.

1159
02:45:28,710 --> 02:45:43,940
That's. I think that's. You know, it's interesting because I think sometimes some years people have like more overlapping close.

1160
02:45:46,820 --> 02:45:50,240
Research interests and I feel like or methods.

1161
02:45:51,890 --> 02:45:58,760
And. I think I can see some overlaps, but also like.

1162
02:45:59,270 --> 02:46:07,770
Yeah. Yeah. And I think so much ends up being dictated, you know, because it's also keeping in mind that.

1163
02:46:10,590 --> 02:46:14,700
Career right now. I think it's not only.

1164
02:46:15,760 --> 02:46:25,470
This rotation under. We heard that. But practices like coaching their.

1165
02:46:27,470 --> 02:46:37,350
Users. Okay, guys.

1166
02:46:37,350 --> 02:46:48,000
Well. And.

1167
02:46:59,290 --> 02:47:07,250
One day I was like, I'm never coming back.

1168
02:47:09,480 --> 02:47:15,020
You think? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1169
02:47:15,300 --> 02:47:19,070
Have you guys been going to get lunch or anything or what? Today I have to run home.

1170
02:47:19,090 --> 02:47:25,000
That's will be finalized. But normally I'm doing like 17.

1171
02:47:25,550 --> 02:47:31,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know. Oh, yeah.

1172
02:47:32,150 --> 02:47:36,020
Yeah. Sally. Oh, yeah.

1173
02:47:36,080 --> 02:47:39,820
Pretty good. I don't mean this week, period, since I was so excited.

1174
02:47:40,340 --> 02:47:47,180
I know the team and I would like one, but it's right across the street there on Sunday.

1175
02:47:47,450 --> 02:47:50,600
It's rare that we had a sandwich place like a that kind of like.

1176
02:47:51,170 --> 02:47:56,330
I know the game, but if it's me, it's because in D.C. they have Sweetgreen everywhere.

1177
02:47:58,220 --> 02:48:04,520
Yeah, well, I had it. I was going to say that's so funny because that for any interviews that would be like my

1178
02:48:04,520 --> 02:48:10,940
favorite moments are going to get to be because then you have to like that said during no,

1179
02:48:11,530 --> 02:48:14,719
I don't know, I'm not going to order anything from there.

1180
02:48:14,720 --> 02:48:17,870
So like, oh, you're not going to be with. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1181
02:48:18,140 --> 02:48:23,000
Well, I also heard that. So you get going that way at that time.

1182
02:48:24,160 --> 02:48:31,610
It's like they call it kind of like this new museum. Follow me or something like that, that that sort of stuff.

1183
02:48:31,840 --> 02:48:34,870
One of the big goals of history. Yeah.

1184
02:48:35,450 --> 02:48:39,740
You know, I think the Kelsey one that isn't always called the dinosaur museum.

1185
02:48:41,080 --> 02:48:45,160
So to have like those two anyway, there's a café in there called Darwin.

1186
02:48:45,430 --> 02:48:50,080
Oh yeah. I've had a someone said what's good like real stuff here.

1187
02:48:50,740 --> 02:49:00,330
There's also real food across across the street in that demand from the other world.

1188
02:49:00,340 --> 02:49:10,100
And so that was my. Is there any fear there that you're just going for that?

1189
02:49:10,610 --> 02:49:15,650
Yeah, it's open. And then not the first to arrive, but there's another door.

1190
02:49:16,400 --> 02:49:21,610
And then you go down the stairs and that. Yeah.

1191
02:49:21,650 --> 02:49:29,560
They were much more popular. It's close to the focus of a massive.

1192
02:49:31,300 --> 02:49:36,720
I didn't think it was very healthy for. So you.

1193
02:49:39,440 --> 02:49:42,510
The original purpose.

1194
02:49:55,830 --> 02:49:58,830
I have talked to my friend Marilyn Stewart.

1195
02:50:01,380 --> 02:50:05,630
Yeah. Yeah, there was like two and a half hours.

1196
02:50:05,640 --> 02:50:10,010
You have to. Not enough to do a lot and then nothing.

1197
02:50:10,620 --> 02:50:14,300
Yeah, I guess. Yeah.

1198
02:50:19,040 --> 02:50:22,760
Excellent. All right. Everybody will enjoy and we will.

1199
02:50:30,080 --> 02:50:33,570
I got my rent passed down here.

1200
02:50:33,640 --> 02:50:43,210
Yeah. So where are you from? I turn off my street and I go down there, and the other day I ran into that experience for something like three miles.

1201
02:50:43,630 --> 02:50:50,210
And then I forgot I also had back. So I know to on that.

1202
02:50:51,240 --> 02:50:55,850
So that's not great. But now when I turned out of my house, I run.

1203
02:50:56,400 --> 02:51:00,470
Mother again. Please turn around and.

1204
02:51:01,840 --> 02:51:15,060
It's like a thousand other people trying to really make sure that that feels like this awful thing has to occur so far in 2007.

1205
02:51:15,310 --> 02:51:25,570
I think it is hard, but I think that if I make it back to it and I wasn't there, that it's like, nice to see the show.

1206
02:51:27,370 --> 02:51:31,240
Your brain worked out in the back seat of six miles. Anything right now?

1207
02:51:31,600 --> 02:51:34,330
Oh, no. I did not agree to the can.

1208
02:51:34,660 --> 02:51:42,400
I was like, oh, if I go in the gym that side of the campus on Monday, I'm not going to have time to work out and come back.

1209
02:51:42,430 --> 02:51:48,729
So I ran there and I went back. But I do yes.

1210
02:51:48,730 --> 02:51:52,150
I would run there again and then run back. Okay.

1211
02:51:52,180 --> 02:51:58,750
The following on Monday. That's my way.

1212
02:51:58,810 --> 02:52:08,490
Nothing like running in here this morning. I finished my workout, and I think I saw what he's about running up here.

1213
02:52:12,730 --> 02:52:15,760
I'm going to read how to make my own video.

1214
02:52:20,200 --> 02:52:26,110
Are you going to work? Because I know works in the way I do her work in a half hour reading.

1215
02:52:27,630 --> 02:52:32,030
And he's. Yeah. I feel like we're kind of one of the reasons.

1216
02:52:32,090 --> 02:52:41,720
I think there's something. It's about the personality. You know.

1217
02:52:50,540 --> 02:52:55,710
What's wrong? I don't know. Cultural acceptance.

1218
02:52:56,530 --> 02:53:00,010
Yeah. Political or socio political? Yeah.

1219
02:53:01,720 --> 02:53:05,410
I think you my five years in the church.
