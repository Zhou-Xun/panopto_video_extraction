1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,850
I wasn't trying to ignore you. My phone. I am setting up a call for all of you to do later on.

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,600
But yeah, today we are going to be talking about how do you best introduce new vaccine.

3
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:16,590
And when I first started thinking about this topic, yeah, I did.

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:22,200
When I first started thinking about this topic a few years ago, it was before the COVID pandemic.

5
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,070
I was thinking about like new pediatric vaccines.

6
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,840
But of course, we've all had experience of this, like the ongoing introduction of a new vaccine.

7
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:38,459
So I'm sure you have lots of thoughts on this yourself. So we talking about, you know, the history of vaccine hesitancy.

8
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,970
How do we measure it? How does that relate to recent outbreaks?

9
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:48,540
And then how do we respond to it as as epidemiologists and as people in public health?

10
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,670
So I wanted to give you just a couple of minutes to write down some of your own thoughts.

11
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,090
This is if you go to this link right here.

12
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,470
Pull ESPN.com slash Abraham Wegner eight for four.

13
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:09,720
You should be able to access. It's just an open ended question.

14
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:18,250
And I would love for you to write down some of your thoughts on what are some things that you have heard about vaccines,

15
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:26,450
some negative things, maybe some things from people in your. Among your family friends.

16
00:01:26,930 --> 00:02:31,060
Let me pull this up as well. All right.

17
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:43,230
You've all been able to access this. Very. A few minute or so more.

18
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:12,210
Okay. So poetry just kind of. Oh, you know, it was just.

19
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:24,040
Yeah. So, um, you know, people have concerns about trust.

20
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:28,700
They're unnatural. You know, people are always thinking about, you know, is natural infection better?

21
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,940
Do you have a better immune response to that? Um, how fast were they developed?

22
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:37,900
Was that something that was, you know, too, too unsafe?

23
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,410
Were pharmaceutical companies concerned about that vaccine?

24
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,459
CO-ADMINISTRATION Yeah, that was a big part of my early research,

25
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:51,550
was thinking about what are parents preferences for how many vaccines they want to give their kids at one point in time,

26
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:56,800
and how many doses they want to give to their children in the first few months of life.

27
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:02,829
Oh, this one is really interesting. So how are vaccines made?

28
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:05,860
You know, what products are they made from?

29
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:14,440
Do they somehow use fetal tissue? I work with a lot of people in Indonesia and there are some concerns there for some vaccines which

30
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:21,160
are made using core products and therefore wouldn't be halal for people to to be vaccinated.

31
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:29,080
So yeah, I mean, I think these are all concerns and we'll definitely take some time at the end of class to talk about these concerns.

32
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:39,270
But I want to back up to the beginning of vaccine hesitancy, because I think sometimes we like to think that,

33
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:43,769
oh, in the past couple of years, this is when really people have gotten really concerned about vaccines.

34
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:49,470
But in reality, this has been something which has been going on for a really long time since the first vaccine.

35
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:53,370
So how was the first vaccine made?

36
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:59,490
And maybe this was introduced to you already before. But I love this story and I think the more people that know about it better.

37
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:05,150
So what happened was that people in Asia,

38
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:15,330
people in the Middle East had for centuries been using the pus in the scar tissue from smallpox, people who had survived from smallpox.

39
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:23,250
And they had been inoculating other people with that as a way to kind of get those other people immune to give them some sort of immunity.

40
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,399
And of course, this was before people knew about germ theory,

41
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:33,000
but this was just this inclination that if you survived from a disease like smallpox, you were less likely to get it in the future.

42
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,440
So maybe there's a way of giving that immunity to somebody else.

43
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:41,819
So this had been going on for a while in the Middle East.

44
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:46,790
And there was this lady, Lady Mary Montagu.

45
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,320
She was a very famous debutante of the 1700s.

46
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,549
She ended up marrying the British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire.

47
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:01,590
And she was known for traveling all around the Middle East and writing these letters back home that were widely published.

48
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:07,440
She herself, she came down with smallpox herself.

49
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:16,560
And in sort of sum, in one way, it was thought it was very sad that she became like a bit disfigured from all of this smallpox scarring.

50
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:20,790
She had a brother who died of smallpox, which certainly wasn't an unusual thing back in the days.

51
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:28,050
So when she had heard that there were these Turkish women who were inoculating their kids against smallpox,

52
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:36,569
she took upon herself to do that to her own kids and then to also bring that practice back to the United Kingdom.

53
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:44,160
And from there, it kind of spread throughout England and then or throughout Europe and then to the American colonies.

54
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:50,610
So this but, you know, immediately there is a backlash.

55
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:54,420
There's people saying, you know, this isn't natural. This isn't God's will.

56
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:57,750
You know, there is potentially a risk that you would be harming somebody.

57
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:02,880
And, you know, there is a small chance that somebody could come down with a full blown case of smallpox, and it'd be pretty bad.

58
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:12,420
But one of the people arguing for this smallpox of Variolation this this early vaccination was Cotton Mather.

59
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:18,600
He was a judge, a clergyman in the American colonies.

60
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,939
If you remember back to high school, if you ever had to read The Crucible,

61
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:30,300
he was one of the judges in the Salem Witch Trials, so maybe not the best of persons, but he was relatively pro-vaccine.

62
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:38,970
So he had that going for him. And he so he wrote all these pamphlets kind of promoting the use of this early smallpox vaccination.

63
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:47,180
So this is obviously like early on there were people who were against vaccine variolation.

64
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:52,190
So what we think of like actually vaccination, it comes down to Edward Jenner.

65
00:07:52,200 --> 00:08:02,839
He was a rural physician and what he noticed was that people made so people who worked a lot with cows would not ever develop smallpox.

66
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:10,160
So there may be a huge outbreak within the city or even in this county area, but these companies would not come down with smallpox.

67
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:17,810
And what he hypothesized was that maybe they would get cowpox and the cowpox would protect them against smallpox.

68
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:24,440
And so cowpox, it does turn out, is a very similar virus, which does provide some immune overlap with smallpox.

69
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,790
So, you know, if you come down with one, you're protected against getting the other.

70
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:38,330
So Dr. Edward Jenner's innovation was not to inoculate people with pus from survivors of smallpox,

71
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:43,409
but he used people who had survived cowpox and, you know, pretty much every survived cowpox.

72
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:47,150
So it was a very, um, a very mild illness in individuals.

73
00:08:48,950 --> 00:09:00,050
And so the first individual that he ended up vaccinating was James Phipps, who was the child of one of his be one of his maids.

74
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:06,259
And of course, you know, one of the reactions early on was, why didn't Edward Jenner, why didn't he vaccinate his own children?

75
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:10,850
He like vaccinated his servants children. It's like the first test of this.

76
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:16,780
The response to that is he had actually already given his children and inoculation against smallpox.

77
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:19,970
And it didn't really make sense to also give them this new vaccination.

78
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:26,170
But anyway, so like our our term for vaccination comes from the Latin word for cow.

79
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:34,220
Um, because, you know, the first vaccine was sprung from this cow based virus,

80
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:38,480
but we've just broadened it to kind of refer to every, every vaccine now.

81
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:50,180
But you know, early on people made a series of like, um, you know, there were these societies that would come up that were anti-vaccine.

82
00:09:50,660 --> 00:10:00,620
So as countries were trying to introduce the smallpox into their, into their countries and, and there were movements in the United Kingdom and France,

83
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:08,660
other countries in Europe and in the United States also to make smallpox vaccine mandatory, there's immediate pushback from people.

84
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:13,999
You know, there is these cartoons of people turning into cows and they're like, why are we, you know,

85
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:22,610
making our our kids and why are we making other people get this cowpox vaccine when it's made from another animal?

86
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:30,650
And it really we see similar diagrams today with like the COVID vaccine or with any other new vaccine which has been introduced.

87
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:37,100
So this this anti-vaccine sentiment, again, from the earliest vaccine it's been there.

88
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:43,010
But I think things are changed in how we respond to different anti-vaccine incidents.

89
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:52,489
Um, so one thing that happened in the 1950s, the cutter incident, so, um, in the early 1950s,

90
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:56,740
this is when the smallpox vaccine or the polio vaccine had been developed and,

91
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:01,219
and when it was introduced into the United States and other other countries.

92
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:06,590
And very early on, there was one factory, the cutter factory.

93
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:11,780
They improperly prepared the vaccine and they hadn't fully inactivated the polio virus.

94
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:21,410
So actually, kids who had been inoculated with the cutter polio vaccine, many of them came down polio, and it ended up that almost 200 were paralyzed.

95
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:26,030
Um, at the same time, there wasn't a huge blowback from that.

96
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:31,070
I mean, I think there was some regulation that was put into place to try to make this less likely to happen in the future.

97
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:38,360
That was the governmental reaction, but there wasn't a strong popular movement to say, Oh, let's not use the polio vaccine anymore.

98
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:43,880
And I think one of the reasons why that was the case is because in the 1950s,

99
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:48,979
there were still all these memories of polio outbreaks happening in the United States.

100
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:52,250
There was like the polio scares of the thirties and forties.

101
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,440
Certainly, you know, FDR had polio.

102
00:11:54,890 --> 00:12:02,120
Um, so there were a lot of people and a lot of parents who were really scared that their kids could come down with polio,

103
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,120
that their kids could get paralyzed, that their kids could die.

104
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:12,889
And so they were much more they're much more resilient in not getting affected by, you know,

105
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:18,530
a real incident which happened, which was that improperly made vaccines, made people ill.

106
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:23,780
I think we can contrast that with, you know, moving ahead a few decades.

107
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:32,420
There was Andrew Wakefield who published this article in 1998 in The Lancet, which, you know,

108
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:39,380
got a lot of press which alleged this link between the measles combined vaccine, the measles mumps rubella vaccine, and.

109
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:46,570
Developmental disorders. And I've read this article and it's like really messy and not even really well written and his,

110
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:54,640
you know, causal thought process isn't really quite there. But, you know, he was able to get published in The Lancet, which, um, if, you know,

111
00:12:54,730 --> 00:13:01,719
stuff from, uh, scientific publishing, this is like one of the top tier journals.

112
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,410
This is like, you know, what people will want in their lifetime.

113
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:12,520
Like scientists will want to get published there. And, you know, he kind of had this garbage article that was published there since published in 1998.

114
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:23,800
Um, it ended up that this study population was, you know, he basically went to kids birthday party and enrolled kids there.

115
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:29,650
There is probably some data that was fabricated. It turns out that he actually wasn't totally anti-vaccine at the time.

116
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:38,120
He just was against a combination vaccine. So he was developing his own single valent measles vaccine and he wanted that to be popularized.

117
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:48,550
I think his grift and all this was like he wanted the MMR vaccine to go away and he wanted his measles vaccine to to be the thing that people used.

118
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:52,720
It didn't turn out that way. And then, you know, over the years, he's just become completely anti-vaccine.

119
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:56,590
So this was published in 1998 and, you know, kind of a garbage study.

120
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:59,980
When do you think it was retracted?

121
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:21,460
So I'll I'll just like listed it and then raise your hand if you think that was the year 1999 2000 2000, one, 3000, 5000, 7000, 9010 since 2010.

122
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:26,110
So it took 12 years for this to get retracted. And again, like, you know,

123
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:35,490
it's amazing that it took that long and kind of as a case study in how our our peer review and publication process definitely has its own faults.

124
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:42,710
And so the people today that are involved with vaccine hesitancy, um,

125
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:48,430
I think there's kind of been a movement since the COVID pandemic for it's maybe

126
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:51,820
a bit more constrained among right wing groups here in the United States,

127
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:57,970
some fringe right wing groups. But I would say in decades past it was much more just like the fringes on both sides.

128
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:05,890
And there historically has been really broad bipartisan support for vaccination here in the United States,

129
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:10,990
which I think up to, like the COVID 19 era was very promising.

130
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:16,629
I think, you know, some of that has dissipated since. But this is all to say that there's, you know,

131
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:21,370
a number of different type of people and number of different celebrities which are kind of involved with this.

132
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:28,089
Of course, you have these disgraced scientists like Andrew Wakefield who are peddling these things.

133
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:35,860
You have, um, Jenny McCarthy, who for a long time was just like talking about how her kid got autism because of vaccines.

134
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:40,210
But then it turns out her kid didn't have autism and probably she was just using him.

135
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:46,600
There are people like Robert Kennedy Junior who I think even now is, you know, very anti-covid vaccine.

136
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,210
And you hear him pop up on all these like Facebook stories.

137
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:59,920
Robert Sears is a really interesting one because he and his dad were these pediatricians who operated in Southern California.

138
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:05,620
And they they wrote this book, the vaccine book.

139
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:09,969
And it's really interesting how they approach things because they're not really anti-vaccine.

140
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:18,160
But what they're suggesting parents should do is to have to to adhere to more of an alternative vaccination schedule.

141
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:23,230
So instead of getting the vaccines in there in the United States, there's all these doses to for six months.

142
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:29,590
Instead of doing that, maybe like one dose, like at three months and like wait a few months and then get another dose.

143
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,010
So, you know, probably by like four or five years old,

144
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:41,590
a kid in the Sears alternative vaccination schedule would get the same doses as somebody else, but they would just be a lot more spread out.

145
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:52,059
Um, so I have looked and there's been some students who worked with me to look at data from the state of Michigan to see if

146
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:57,459
people are actually adhering to these alternative schedules that like Sears is advocating it and they're really not.

147
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:03,790
But there are a lot of people who are delaying their vaccines, and I think there's motivation behind just delaying in principle because of this.

148
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:09,489
But the interesting thing in this book is Sears will say, you know,

149
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:13,540
this is something that you should do, but try not to tell too many people around you to do it,

150
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:21,130
because he realizes that vaccines give people herd immunity and your kid can rely on the herd immunity from people around them.

151
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,990
And so it's it's this interesting argument where he's like,

152
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:31,089
I hope the people around your kid will get vaccinated, but I don't want your kid self to get vaccinated.

153
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:37,600
So it's messy. And, um, and I think he, I don't think he's been.

154
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,010
You know, disbarred like Andrew Wakefield doesn't have a medical license anymore.

155
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:46,960
I do think theory does, but has periodically gotten in trouble for this.

156
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:56,230
Okay. So this gives you an idea that I think is really important to think through, like what actually is vaccine hesitancy.

157
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:05,080
One thing in the article I think I gave you for today is just to think through what, what, why,

158
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:13,650
what are some reasons why people have gotten get or do not get vaccines and these authors come up with this helpful,

159
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:19,509
uh, these helpful five different dimensions of why people will or will not get vaccines.

160
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:22,060
And I like you because they all serve of it's easy to remember.

161
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:26,290
Of course, access is paramount, you know, like, is there a vaccine clinic in your area?

162
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:37,330
Affordability and this is not in just in terms of the the financial costs but what is the time cost to to get the vaccine.

163
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:44,709
You can think of awareness like do people even know that a vaccine is available? Um, there's activation, which I think is really important.

164
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:48,520
We'll be talking more about that. So there's sort of like nudges that you can give people.

165
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:52,540
Do you give people text messages? How difficult also is it to get a vaccine?

166
00:18:52,840 --> 00:19:00,370
And one thing I've noticed is I am I'm on this scheduled to get my my new COVID bivalent booster next week.

167
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:05,319
And it was much more difficult for me to register to get that than any of the previous booster shots.

168
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:09,640
I feel like there's a lot more like pages I had to go through on the web to end up getting it.

169
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,840
And so I think things like that which just are, um,

170
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:21,880
limiting activation is all about like decreasing any of the time or time required to register to get a vaccine, like making it the default choice.

171
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:28,030
And then acceptance is, I think this idea of hesitancy like how, how confident are people in vaccines?

172
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:31,570
Do they like vaccines or are they actively refusing them?

173
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,049
And so that's how to see that.

174
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:44,260
I think it is important to potentially distinguish between psychological issues of hesitancy and some of these other behavioral issues.

175
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:48,489
So I probably should have been going through these other slides as I was talking about this.

176
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:55,780
But yeah, access difficulty accessing clinics in that can be in terms of physical distance, you know, is there public transport?

177
00:19:55,780 --> 00:20:02,830
You have your own transportation affordability, do you have insurance activation?

178
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:09,010
Um, we think of things like nudges. We can think of like mandates which are out there, text messages.

179
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:15,010
This is a really interesting study which came out of the University of Pennsylvania.

180
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:25,570
And what they did is they had this very large scale, randomized controlled trial where there was a control group,

181
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:32,230
but then other groups of people got a variety of different messages.

182
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:36,280
And this was before the pandemic, and this was about getting a flu shot.

183
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:43,060
And so they're just trying to test, like, what are the best ways that through a text message, you can get somebody to get their flu shot?

184
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:52,600
Um, and, you know, there are some things which just so anything above this,

185
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:59,950
this line here is something that was significantly related to an increase in getting people vaccinated.

186
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,900
So there's some things which didn't work, you know, like sharing a joke by text didn't seem to work.

187
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:11,470
Um, you know, asking people to like call a number or to apply to get the flu shot that didn't really work.

188
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:16,030
Um, like a video about it didn't seem to work.

189
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:22,600
They had some other things, I think just to see if this was a controlled, like a health behavior and like exercise stuff.

190
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:30,970
But if you told somebody like we have a flu shot reserved for you, like come to this clinic,

191
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:37,209
the flu shot, like it's it's reserved for you that would really push people over.

192
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:43,480
And I think it's this idea that maybe you as an individual kind of feel that you owe somebody something like,

193
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:47,020
oh, they they're telling me that it's reserved. So, yeah, that makes sense.

194
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:55,750
And then also that's like decreasing any of the, the, the feelings that, oh, it'll take a lot of effort for me to like reserve something.

195
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:04,800
So just again, trying to make this as easy as possible, trying to make it seem as easy as possible and making it the, the kind of the approach, right.

196
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:10,540
So the default choice, I think those are the things which work with getting people vaccinated.

197
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:23,330
Okay. So about seven years now, the W.H.O. had this strategic advisory group of experts on immunization or sage,

198
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:27,470
and they had this working group on vaccine hesitancy. And they came up with this definition.

199
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:34,340
They said vaccine hesitancy refers to delay or refusal of vaccines despite their availability.

200
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:43,400
They say that vaccine hesitancy varies across time, place and vaccines, and it's influenced by complacency, convenience and confidence.

201
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:47,360
So this is a kind of a pretty broad definition of vaccine hesitancy.

202
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:53,150
It's kind of like, oh, as long as you have access to it, if you're refusing it or delaying, that's vaccine hesitancy.

203
00:22:54,020 --> 00:23:02,870
In more recent years, there's sort of was this back and forth about what actually should be considered vaccine hesitancy and what's not.

204
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:07,860
And we've kind of settled on this idea that vaccine hesitancy is more of a psychological state.

205
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:12,680
So vaccine hesitancy refers to your attitudes about vaccines, your concerns.

206
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:19,760
And it could be about like vaccines in general, could be very specific to a certain vaccine that's different than vaccination behaviors.

207
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,380
That's kind of like, do you get the vaccine or not?

208
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:31,460
The reason why I think this is important is I think in a lot of literature, even stuff that all of review as like a peer reviewer,

209
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:33,319
there will be people who will say like, oh,

210
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:40,010
we have a measure of vaccine hesitancy or a measure of vaccine hesitancy is did this person get the COVID vaccine or not?

211
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:43,520
But that's that's a measured behavior, not a hesitancy.

212
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,670
Hesitancy would be kind of like, oh, what do you think about the COVID vaccine?

213
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:51,440
Do you have any concerns about it? Like, do you have concerns about side effects?

214
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:57,920
The other thing about vaccine hesitancy is I think it's very okay to be vaccine hesitant.

215
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:06,740
I mean, I think we live in a world now of shared decision making between like doctors and parents and different patients.

216
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:11,210
And I think parents are a lot of them.

217
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:19,249
I really think that the average vaccine, hesitant parents or even if they're thinking about themselves, they just want what's best for their kids.

218
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:23,990
They want best for themselves. They don't think they're trying to be like super evil about it.

219
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:30,710
And, you know, like kind of giving a kid a shot with the needle.

220
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:36,410
There's sort of a bit of a disgust reaction about that. Like your kid's crying, who wants to make their kid cry?

221
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:40,670
So that's obviously, I think vaccine hesitancy is normal.

222
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:47,060
And I think we're not doing any service to the world in public health if we are just demonizing it so much.

223
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:50,720
So that's one thing that I'll want to mention.

224
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:56,800
But at the same time, I think we need to be able to talk through this.

225
00:24:56,810 --> 00:25:03,860
And also, you know, I think there are some vaccines which maybe if you think about like is a situation specific,

226
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:05,950
should a kid get it or should an individual get it or not?

227
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:10,070
But in general, we don't think there's equipoise between getting a vaccine and not getting a vaccine.

228
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:13,250
So, you know, I do think doctors should push.

229
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:17,899
I do think there is an ethical reason for them to recommend you to get a vaccine.

230
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:22,810
It's not just like let's talk about vaccines and, you know, come to a choice that you want.

231
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:30,290
So, like, I do think doctors should, you know, use all their powers of persuasion to get people vaccinated.

232
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:34,010
But I think we can normalize the hesitancy that individuals have.

233
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:46,610
Okay. So how can we measure this? So the Sage working group also came up with this vaccine hesitancy scale, and there is ten items for it.

234
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:49,890
And again, this kind of has to do with people's psychological attitudes.

235
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:53,860
You know, our childhood vaccines are important. They're effective.

236
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,920
They're important for the health of others in my community.

237
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:05,000
So I've worked across a number of settings to figure out, like, what are the best ways of using this scale?

238
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,540
Because basically the sage working group kind of came up with this scale, but they didn't really tell researchers how to use it.

239
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:15,740
So some of my research has been involved with like applying this in diverse settings.

240
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:23,780
One thing that you'll note, and this is sort of just something that you should keep in mind if you're involved with any like scales,

241
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:24,979
like there's depression scales,

242
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:32,420
there's measures of like discrimination, there's measures of vaccine hesitancy is to think about like the directionality of the items.

243
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:42,950
So for a lot of these, they'll ask like and all of these are asked on kind of a five point Likert scale from strongly disagree to strongly agree.

244
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:49,040
So for some of these you know, agreeing is positive, like childhood vaccines are important for my child's health.

245
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:58,850
If I agree with that, I'm relatively pro-vaccine. But my child does not need vaccines for diseases that are new or that are not common anymore.

246
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:02,750
If you agree with that, then you're like a bit more on the vaccine hesitant side of the spectrum.

247
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:09,950
So that's how to say that, like the directionality of these of these questions vary.

248
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:17,100
So as. Heard my study. You know, of course I'm trying to combine the items in the scale together,

249
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:23,190
but I kind of have to flip the direction of some of these so that they're all going in the same direction.

250
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:34,049
So some results from a study I did, and this is in Shanghai, China, and there were 1200 people that were involved.

251
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:43,220
They were sampled from immunization clinics throughout the city. And this is this is kind of what we see.

252
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:55,110
And I again, I flipped this scale so that, uh, higher numbers mean that, or if they strongly agree, they're more likely to be hesitant.

253
00:27:57,270 --> 00:28:01,559
So basically the blue green are, they're more positive towards vaccines.

254
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:05,380
The, the red orange is they're more hesitant.

255
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,990
And so we can look at what are the differences across some of these items.

256
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,990
So in general, at least these parents in Shanghai were saying that vaccines are important.

257
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:20,190
They're thinking that vaccines are a good way to protect their children. They do think that the vaccines are effective,

258
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:27,660
but they are concerned about side effects and they're also concerned especially about side effects for newer vaccines.

259
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:41,690
So one thing we tried to do is we tried to link their attitudes towards vaccines to what their behaviors were later on.

260
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:49,070
So I think this was a study in the baseline data was collected in 2017,

261
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:56,390
but then around 2020 we got their kids actual vaccination records and then we linked them together.

262
00:28:57,950 --> 00:29:05,120
So from this entire scale, we dichotomous people into whether they were hesitant or not.

263
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:09,290
We just have the simple measure of based on, you know, adding up all the responses.

264
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:18,110
Are people more hesitant or are they less after? And then what we did is we looked at three different vaccination outcomes.

265
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:21,980
One was, did they get all of the routine vaccine?

266
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,700
So these are long used vaccines in the immunization program.

267
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:33,140
Specifically the expanded program on immunization. So did they get these these routine vaccines which have been used for a while?

268
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:37,490
And then we asked, did they get some more newly introduced vaccines,

269
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:43,280
specifically looking at PCV, the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and the road virus vaccine.

270
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:52,220
So what we found is that for people who are vaccine hesitant, there was not a significant difference in getting these routine long used vaccines.

271
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:57,350
So this is odds ratio and then 95% confidence interval encompasses one basically means

272
00:29:57,590 --> 00:30:02,390
that for parents who were vaccine hesitant and not their rates of getting their kids,

273
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:05,270
these epi vaccines were the same.

274
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:13,520
But for people who were vaccine hesitant, they were less likely to get the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and the rotavirus vaccine for their kids.

275
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:22,850
So I think this study shows kind of what the distinction is between like these actual behaviors and what vaccine hesitancy is like.

276
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:27,440
And it also tells you, like, what is the limit of vaccine hesitancy?

277
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:33,770
So like for these these robust programs, they can kind of be shielded from vaccine hesitancy.

278
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:39,200
So for these long used vaccines, you know, people will still get them regardless of their hesitancy.

279
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:46,340
But for more new, more newly introduced vaccines, potentially there is less.

280
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:54,860
That they'd be less likely to get them. Okay.

281
00:30:55,310 --> 00:31:00,650
Um, I have another pool everywhere for you to do.

282
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:05,960
I know. We've just been. We've been talking at you for a long time, so let me get this ready for you.

283
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:15,090
Um. Okay.

284
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:19,950
So if you go back to that same link, you should get, like a new map of the United States.

285
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:28,380
And I would love for you just to click what is what part of the US do you think has really high rates of nonmedical exemptions to vaccination?

286
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:34,559
And by this I mean, you know, kids for school throughout the country, they need to have certain vaccines.

287
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:41,220
They need to have a record. Of course, if they have a medical exemption, they can't they don't need to get a vaccine.

288
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:48,480
But nonmedical exemption would be like, oh, a parent is able to say they have some like religious or philosophical reason for not getting a vaccine.

289
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:16,130
It's one thing where you're dropping all these. Someone dropped it in the middle of the ocean, which I respect that.

290
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:31,100
Okay. Yeah.

291
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,360
Okay. So this is what you're saying.

292
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:55,800
So it seems that many of you are suggesting that there places in the South are more likely to have high rates of nonmedical exemptions.

293
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:04,710
A few places in California, but it seems you're really you're really not like in Texas and Alabama.

294
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:14,070
Okay. So I have a study from a few years ago, but, you know, things could have changed since then.

295
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:26,400
Um. And these are the places where they said there was the highest rates of nonmedical exemption.

296
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:31,080
And it's like when we're looking at counties, it's Idaho.

297
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:36,570
And, you know, one place in Wisconsin. A place in Utah. Is anyone from Idaho up here?

298
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:41,670
Not not not to bash Idaho. But, you know, apparently they don't like their vaccines.

299
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:50,820
Um, and then they also looked at. So this is looking at percentages, but then they also looked at like, what are the absolute numbers?

300
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:54,929
So maybe, you know, there's a place which doesn't have that high very.

301
00:33:54,930 --> 00:34:01,620
But if it has more kids, where is it? And so actually, I'm you know, here in Michigan, we are not doing well in southeast Michigan.

302
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:07,050
So we are one of the hotspots of, you know, there's a lot of kindergartners who have these nonmedical exemptions.

303
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:10,889
There are some places in Texas. So good on you for getting that.

304
00:34:10,890 --> 00:34:16,110
But yeah, Washington like Seattle and Portland, Salt Lake City, those are kind of the big places.

305
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:24,000
And interestingly enough, for a long time, the two places in the United States where it was hardest to get a waiver,

306
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:29,940
where they had the strictest rules were Mississippi and West Virginia,

307
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:35,580
which you don't think of for like progressive vaccination or progressive public health values.

308
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:41,220
But those are the places where for a long time they did not allow any non-medical exemptions.

309
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,590
But since then, more states have followed.

310
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:49,470
So I believe, like in California, there's no longer non-medical exemptions in some places in the Northeast as well.

311
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:59,360
Any any surprises or. Comments like insulting somebody's hometown.

312
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:01,770
Yeah. So you think it's changed a lot?

313
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:10,080
Because, I mean, I know a lot more people now who are so extremely religious that they can't get vaccines for their military or whatever.

314
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:15,420
Yeah, yeah, I do. I do think it has changed and that's like the unfortunate thing.

315
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:22,590
I just have a survey which is out where I ask people how.

316
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:26,610
And the thing is, I, I don't have much general data, but I ask them, um.

317
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:32,639
Have they kind of changed how they think about vaccines since prior to the pandemic?

318
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:37,950
And I'm thinking about childhood vaccines in particular, um, for, for a lot of people, no.

319
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:45,450
And actually there's more people who are more positive now than less positive, but there is that contingent of people who are like more negative.

320
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:49,589
So, um, and then unfortunately, I think in contrast to the past,

321
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:55,290
things have just gotten a bit more politically polarized, whereas I think in the past it wasn't necessarily that case.

322
00:35:55,290 --> 00:36:04,180
But I do think things have changed. Okay.

323
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:13,850
So how does this actually matter? Because, you know, if vaccines aren't really that effective or, you know,

324
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:18,690
if we're still not having outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases, then what does it even matter?

325
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:26,610
So this is an interesting case study of measles in the US and I'm kind of stopping it at 2018.

326
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:35,729
Um, but the thing to know is that in the United States around 2000, we declared measles to be eliminated,

327
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:42,690
meaning that there was no longer any endemic transmission of measles in the U.S. So there would be cases of measles,

328
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:48,900
you know, in 2000 through 27, there's under 100 cases of measles, but above zero.

329
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:51,270
But the whole idea is that those are imported cases.

330
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:56,459
Those are like somebody came from France, had measles, and maybe they spread it to like their family members,

331
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:58,980
but like the chain of transmission cut off really quickly.

332
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:11,390
But in, in 2014 we had this huge outbreak and uh, and in some years since, we've also had these huge outbreaks.

333
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:17,180
And one thing to note about, you know, right now we can say measles is still eliminated,

334
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:23,630
but what we're concerned about is if there's a chain of transmission of measles, which lasts over a year,

335
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:27,170
because then we are saying that, you know, if measles is around for over a year,

336
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:32,630
then like we're no longer or it's no longer eliminated and then our public health strategies kind of change.

337
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:41,720
So one of the things that happened in 2014 or what's happening in the years prior has to do with an immigrant community in the Twin Cities.

338
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:52,010
So there's a pretty big contingent of Somali-Americans who live in the Twin Cities, the Minneapolis Saint Paul area.

339
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:59,120
And if you look at like 20 years ago, vaccination rates were were pretty high.

340
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:05,990
And, you know, we're pretty similar between Somali and on small children in that area.

341
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:12,920
But then starting around 2007, they dropped pretty rapidly.

342
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:18,590
And you might think, why is that the case? And of course, the reason is Andrew Wakefield.

343
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:26,090
So he as part of his, you know, new career now that he's no longer a practicing physician,

344
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:30,710
is he goes around to places and, you know, has these anti-vaccine rallies.

345
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:38,870
Um, and he was able to, I don't know exactly how he got connected to the Somali-American community,

346
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:47,750
but he was able to take advantage of their situation, especially this is, this is, you know, minority, um, minorities, community.

347
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:54,200
They probably have a lot of distrust of the government for, you know, real discrimination issues which they're facing.

348
00:38:54,200 --> 00:39:00,650
So it's very easy in such a distressing environment to go to this community and say, oh, you know,

349
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:05,870
like that vaccine that like governmental intervention they're making you do you don't really need to do it.

350
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:06,980
It's bad for your kids.

351
00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:17,420
And, you know, it's, it's just the community where those kinds of things are really, um, can that kind of misinformation can spread really quickly.

352
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:19,610
And also this is probably a community which, you know,

353
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:25,040
the Department of Public Health in Minnesota might not have been paying too much attention to and,

354
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:33,110
you know, for a few years, we don't really notice things that are happening until and I think I must have missed this.

355
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:42,440
Short of it. But the Somali-Americans in Twin Cities represented a huge proportion of this outbreak in 2014.

356
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:50,450
So this outbreak in 2014 was really driven by the dynamics of this low vaccination coverage that was happening.

357
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:54,670
So a few things to keep in mind from this is that, you know,

358
00:39:54,710 --> 00:40:03,390
if you look overall and like Somali American children are probably like, you know, single digit percentages in Minnesota.

359
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:08,060
So if you look at the overall number, it's probably very close in 2014 to around 89%,

360
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:16,010
which isn't great because one measles vaccine to be as high as possible, but like 90% vaccination coverage seems seems good.

361
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:25,910
But if you have a community where only 42% of people are vaccinated, that means there's a huge number of susceptible individuals.

362
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:37,560
And how measles operates, it's like a highly contagious disease that if somebody with measles goes into like a

363
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:42,920
community where there's so many susceptibles like measles is going to spread like wildfire.

364
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:45,590
And I think that's that's exactly what happened in these communities.

365
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:51,229
So, you know, if you looked overall among Minnesota children, among children in Twin Cities,

366
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:53,270
it probably seemed there's pretty high vaccination coverage.

367
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:59,270
But when you actually distill down into these clusters of individuals who have contact and sustained contact with each other,

368
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:09,600
there just was not high enough herd immunity. And so, you know, a lot of effort since then has been devoted to trying to build, like,

369
00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:18,230
community outreach efforts and to try to get, you know, kids in this community vaccinated to a higher level.

370
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:25,170
Okay. So we can also look at the story of Brazil.

371
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:28,980
So this also occurred in 2014.

372
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:35,730
So around the time that the US was declared, measles eliminated the whole of America, North and South America,

373
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:43,560
kind of under the Pan American Health Organization issued this declaration that, you know, measles was eliminated in our area of the world.

374
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:54,170
And I think that was that was a huge achievement because, you know, really, after smallpox eradication in the 1970s, there just wasn't all of that.

375
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:58,710
There was all these pushes to eliminate more diseases, but they just weren't they were stopped.

376
00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:02,550
So, you know, the Americas being able to eliminate measles was like this big coup.

377
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:11,340
And so if you look at the situation of like what's going on in Brazil, you see like in to in the 2000s, like only ten cases.

378
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:17,310
But then in 2013, there's a pretty big outbreak.

379
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:23,240
And in 2014, there's a pretty huge outbreak. And actually, this outbreak lasted longer than a year.

380
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:28,980
So then all of a sudden, Brazil no longer had no longer had eliminated measles.

381
00:42:29,370 --> 00:42:32,490
And it was a measles endemic country that.

382
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,660
And this is just a chart showing the different genotypes of measles,

383
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:41,899
because basically they were doing, you know, as part of their epidemiological investigations.

384
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:48,970
They're trying to see if there's is a change of transmission across measles cases and they're doing genotyping just to see,

385
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:53,690
you know, are these cases over time? Are they actually the same or could it have been like a reintroduced case?

386
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:57,380
But it was it was the same epidemiological chain of transmission.

387
00:42:58,430 --> 00:43:03,079
Fortunately, they were able to after a year to clamp down on this.

388
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:11,090
And then after waiting like another year, they were able to say, I think in 2013 that they had, you know, successfully re eliminated measles.

389
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:22,460
But, you know, it's a huge amount of effort. And thinking about costs from studies which I've looked at, it seems like in a measles outbreak,

390
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:29,990
the government will have to probably spend around $10,000 per case to do all these investigations to try to clamp down on the outbreak.

391
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:36,410
And that's just a huge amount of money, which, you know, if we were just vaccinating individuals, we wouldn't have to worry about.

392
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,209
Okay. So I'm going back to the title of this lecture.

393
00:43:42,210 --> 00:43:47,490
It's like what's going on during the period of introducing vaccines?

394
00:43:47,490 --> 00:43:48,960
Why is that really important?

395
00:43:49,350 --> 00:43:55,200
And I want to tell a story of two different vaccines, which I think highlights why how you introduce the vaccine matters.

396
00:43:56,190 --> 00:43:58,499
There is HPV in the US.

397
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:07,290
So if we look at, you know, over 20 years ago prior to the HPV vaccine introduction, you know, people really didn't know much about HPV.

398
00:44:10,350 --> 00:44:20,160
And then in 2016, the ACP, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, recommended that all teenage girls get the vaccine.

399
00:44:20,430 --> 00:44:25,530
And around that time there was this huge I don't even want to say it's like a backlash.

400
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:28,530
But on the media basically was like, oh,

401
00:44:28,530 --> 00:44:38,850
so now the government is wanting to have us vaccinate young girls to prevent them from sexually transmitted infection.

402
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:44,280
So then all of a sudden it was like, Oh, is the government trying to engineer people's sexuality?

403
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:52,170
And so I definitely think like definitely a hampered introduction.

404
00:44:52,170 --> 00:45:01,379
Like it wasn't very it wasn't very successful. And if you look at even more recent data about like what proportion of kids are

405
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:06,840
vaccinated because now the vaccine is recommended for male teenagers as well,

406
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:14,190
it's something around like 65% of all individuals will have the vaccine.

407
00:45:14,190 --> 00:45:19,020
But if you look at being up to date, like finishing your dose series, only about half are.

408
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:31,360
So I would like to compare HPV to hepatitis B because hepatitis B, if you do not know, can be sexually transmitted.

409
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:35,170
It also can be transmitted through injection injecting, drug use.

410
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:42,160
You know, there is some other infant transmission, but both of these are diseases which can be sexually transmitted.

411
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:47,200
They are viruses which can cause cancer.

412
00:45:47,230 --> 00:45:54,730
For HPV, we think of cervical cancer also like oral cancers, you know, and penile cancers as well.

413
00:45:55,030 --> 00:45:57,220
Hepatitis B, of course, that's liver cancer.

414
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:06,070
But the difference is for hepatitis B, there is like pretty high completion, you know, by the Edison time period.

415
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:10,720
Nine out of ten kids will have completed their hepatitis B series.

416
00:46:10,990 --> 00:46:15,730
And that's very different from HPV. And with HPV, you know, we are struggling.

417
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:20,950
We're kind of getting up there. But like, it's a very slow process.

418
00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:26,169
And I think one of the things that was the difference between use is hepatitis B for whatever reason,

419
00:46:26,170 --> 00:46:37,080
just like was not discussed as SGI vaccine or you know, it's not a vaccine for people who are injection injection drug users.

420
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:40,449
Like it's it was just like a vaccine which we thought,

421
00:46:40,450 --> 00:46:47,500
let's give a universal vaccine for everybody to get the hepatitis B and be protected against it.

422
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:56,320
And then I also think that it's a bit different because hepatitis B is given to infants, or at least the schedule can start with infants.

423
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:04,780
And so, of course, like the sexual nature of the virus, transmission just isn't as readily apparent as if you're thinking about a teenager.

424
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:12,970
But these vaccines, you know, in my mind that you kind of have a similar profile of like what they can do and how important they are.

425
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:19,600
And yet we end up with like two different trajectories of how well they've been accepted into the population.

426
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:31,650
So one thing I tried to do is to use a discrete choice experiment to examine what do

427
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:38,010
parents think about vaccinating their kids at different ages against different types of.

428
00:47:40,790 --> 00:47:48,560
Different types of diseases. So the three choice experiment is a way to examine the product.

429
00:47:48,590 --> 00:47:52,309
A product in the product could be a vaccine. It could be something else.

430
00:47:52,310 --> 00:47:57,050
And to think about what are the attributes of that product and what are the different ATP levels?

431
00:47:58,670 --> 00:48:08,270
So for so for vaccines, what I was thinking about is, you know, could we change the age at which a vaccine was administered?

432
00:48:08,630 --> 00:48:12,080
We, you know, give this to a two year old, a six year old, a 12 year old, a 15 year old.

433
00:48:13,070 --> 00:48:16,670
We could think about, you know, what kind of disease does it prevent?

434
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,870
Is this like a disease which is transmitted through the air?

435
00:48:20,870 --> 00:48:24,919
Is it through food? Is it through mosquitoes or other vectors?

436
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:30,380
Is it sexually transmitted? We just think it prevents against cancer and then we can think of the cost of it.

437
00:48:31,370 --> 00:48:38,299
So how a disease works is you randomize these attributes and then you have

438
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:43,220
people respond to fake vaccines and you ask them which one would they prefer?

439
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:46,520
Like if they had to get a vaccine, which one would they like?

440
00:48:47,450 --> 00:48:55,849
So I asked this for a population of parents in the United States and China, I gave them, you know, two different vaccine choices.

441
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:59,240
And then also let them choose that, you know, an opt out that they don't want either vaccine.

442
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:00,320
And this is for their kid.

443
00:49:01,130 --> 00:49:09,890
I did try to make these, you know, like consistent in terms of how long or how good is the vaccine and then how serious is the disease.

444
00:49:09,890 --> 00:49:17,480
So the idea was in this study is that parents were supposed to think about like everything else,

445
00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:21,679
everything is the same between these two vaccines and the disease they protect against,

446
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:31,489
except for when your kid gets the vaccine, what's the cost and how is the infection spread and does the infection result in cancer?

447
00:49:31,490 --> 00:49:39,590
So, you know, argue that the whole point of the study was to kind of drill down on this idea of like, why are parents not liking SDI vaccines?

448
00:49:39,590 --> 00:49:46,790
Is that, you know, particularly problematic for people? And so this is just one example,

449
00:49:46,790 --> 00:49:55,010
but there's a number of different randomization and people respond to a couple of different of these of these choices.

450
00:49:55,130 --> 00:50:00,020
And then we can kind of combine all their data together and see what people do or do not like.

451
00:50:00,890 --> 00:50:07,700
So this is a chart just looking at what people's preferences are within the United States and in China.

452
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:12,680
And I will mention.

453
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:14,600
So this is the odds ratio. This is a one.

454
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:25,040
So this would mean that people don't really have strong preferences if it crosses this boundary and if it is here above one,

455
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:29,600
they have strong preferences for it. If it's below one, they have strong preferences against it.

456
00:50:31,410 --> 00:50:35,580
So one thing is, you know, we did allow an opt out and people loved the opt out.

457
00:50:35,590 --> 00:50:38,430
So people just were like, I don't want to get my get vaccinated. So that's one thing.

458
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:43,980
But there wasn't actually the people didn't really have strong preferences for anything

459
00:50:44,370 --> 00:50:51,240
except that they had strong preferences for a vaccine that was sexually transmitted,

460
00:50:51,570 --> 00:51:00,840
which is all to say that, you know, in this survey, we kind of have this definitive finding then that parents in either in China or

461
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:06,540
in the U.S. just kind of react strongly against the idea of an STI vaccine.

462
00:51:07,110 --> 00:51:10,590
And they don't really have that for like a foodborne or a mosquito borne disease.

463
00:51:15,850 --> 00:51:20,050
The other thing that I could do is like, based on how people responded to all of these things,

464
00:51:20,290 --> 00:51:27,310
um, I could try to group them into individuals who kind of had similar types of responses.

465
00:51:28,450 --> 00:51:31,389
And we actually had kind of a lot of similarities across these countries.

466
00:51:31,390 --> 00:51:36,570
But for about 10% of the US sample and 8% in China, they were just like vaccine injectors.

467
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:42,250
They didn't want any vaccine for their kid. Um, so like if they had an opt out choice, they were like, I'm gonna do the opt out.

468
00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:49,450
I'm not gonna make it that vaccine. Then we had people who were like, I call them careful deciders.

469
00:51:49,450 --> 00:51:53,269
So they thought strongly about or they thought across these different arguments.

470
00:51:53,270 --> 00:51:59,770
They thought like, oh, you know, the cost, the, you know, whether it was an SJ vaccine or not,

471
00:51:59,810 --> 00:52:03,110
whether protecting cancer, all these things they considered in tandem.

472
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:09,770
But then there are some people who, you know, really latched on to this idea of they like the preferred cancer vaccines.

473
00:52:09,770 --> 00:52:14,120
And that seemed especially important in China.

474
00:52:14,310 --> 00:52:22,280
Uh, people who were just like, if this vaccine was a cancer vaccine, they'd be more likely to choose that product.

475
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:31,400
And then there are some people who just have stronger preferences for vaccine and kids at an older age and some for vaccinating kids at a younger age.

476
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:43,460
Um, and I think the whole idea behind this is that, you know, certainly there are a variety of, you know, commercials that we see about vaccines.

477
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:48,799
And I'm sure the pharmaceutical companies are pretty pushing those out have done like focus groups and,

478
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:53,300
you know, like certainly for COVID 19, there have been a lot of commercials out there.

479
00:52:53,870 --> 00:53:02,929
Um, but I think through some rigorous scientific studies, we can actually examine specifically what people's preferences are.

480
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:10,960
And, you know, um, if people are preferring a cancer vaccine, then that's something that we can kind of glommed onto.

481
00:53:10,970 --> 00:53:16,490
That's something that we can highlight in our messaging, assuming that, you know, this vaccine does protect against.

482
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:28,459
See it again, this free choice experiment. If you don't have much experience with it before, it's maybe a bit convoluted to think through.

483
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:38,660
But it's is born out of a lot of market research on people who, you know, maybe they were making this product to do like Doritos flavor.

484
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:43,850
So they want to kind of separate out like how big is the bag, how much does it cost, what kind of flavorings in it?

485
00:53:44,210 --> 00:53:47,630
And then test out which one works better with an audience.

486
00:53:47,930 --> 00:53:52,870
And in more recent years that has kind of we've used it in the health care setting to figure out for different products.

487
00:53:54,680 --> 00:54:00,540
What do people prefer about that product? Okay.

488
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:10,880
So moving on, I think I wanted to spend a bit of time about like what are people's misconceptions that they might be having about vaccines,

489
00:54:11,430 --> 00:54:16,739
um, and what are some common complaints?

490
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:25,470
And I think a lot of you were writing about these in the first poll, this idea that vaccines might not be as good as a natural infection.

491
00:54:25,950 --> 00:54:34,770
There's this idea that vaccines can be overloading the body's immune system, and that's potentially very problematic here for administering vaccines.

492
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:39,750
There can be worry that vaccines contain chemicals, which are very bad for you.

493
00:54:40,050 --> 00:54:42,780
And certainly there can be religious objections to vaccines.

494
00:54:43,230 --> 00:54:48,990
Um, anything for your mentioning potentially some of these maybe it's related to like aborted fetal tissue,

495
00:54:48,990 --> 00:54:53,010
um, for Muslim groups, maybe there's concerns that the vaccines are not followed.

496
00:54:54,990 --> 00:55:07,649
So let's talk about some of these. The first one is, you know, it's that what does it mean to be like as good as a natural infection?

497
00:55:07,650 --> 00:55:14,340
What does it mean that, you know, maybe you get like better immunity from a natural infection versus the vaccine?

498
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:18,570
In reality, it's like not it's not very simple. And I hear that a lot for coconuts.

499
00:55:20,070 --> 00:55:28,740
But, you know, I work on a number of cohort studies of of individuals which have gotten repeatedly infected with COVID 19.

500
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:37,170
And sometimes they've gotten the vaccine, sometimes not. And, you know, I, I will say there's a lot of reinfections happening up there for COVID 19.

501
00:55:38,610 --> 00:55:46,739
So I don't think we can definitively say, even for SARS-CoV-2, that like natural infection is really the the be all,

502
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:53,100
end all that once you get infected, you're going to be protected for life because the virus is just, you know, evolving really rapidly.

503
00:55:56,090 --> 00:56:04,700
And then also the nice thing about vaccines is, first off, they don't give you disease, but or in very rare circumstances would be serious.

504
00:56:05,690 --> 00:56:08,870
But, you know, there are many vaccines which can combine multiple strains together,

505
00:56:08,870 --> 00:56:14,570
like the chemical conjugate vaccine, which I think plastic or there's like a 20 valent version of that.

506
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:19,549
And so, like, if you're infected with one pneumococcal strain, sure.

507
00:56:19,550 --> 00:56:26,180
Maybe your body is then developing an immune response to that. But it's like 20 strains all together in one injection.

508
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:31,749
Then you're protected against very strains. Okay.

509
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:35,550
So this is one concern. The immunization schedule is becoming more complex.

510
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:40,780
And certainly it's true that there are new vaccines out there in recent years.

511
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:44,980
There's like HPV, Tdap, PSP, shingles.

512
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:50,170
Um, not all countries use all vaccines.

513
00:56:50,170 --> 00:56:53,740
Like in the US. We don't use the tuberculosis vaccine, although many other countries do.

514
00:56:54,610 --> 00:56:58,480
Um. So here is the US.

515
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:05,050
And over time, this is just a simplified diagram of what vaccines are being used.

516
00:57:05,470 --> 00:57:12,750
And essentially we see that, uh, there's, there's a lot of vaccines that we use now.

517
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:24,490
So like maybe your grandparents only were vaccinated against smallpox in DTP and maybe your parents then got DTP and polio and measles,

518
00:57:24,910 --> 00:57:30,729
but then maybe you yourself had like three or four other vaccines.

519
00:57:30,730 --> 00:57:34,870
And then kids born today have like an additional three or four vaccines which are recommended to them.

520
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:37,299
So it can kind of be scary, just scary,

521
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:45,520
just looking at this list and seeing how many vaccines and seemingly we just are getting vaccinated get so much more.

522
00:57:47,650 --> 00:57:52,780
I think it's important to think about like what is what is our immune response like to these actually?

523
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:57,280
And so some people have counted the number of antigens that your body has to respond to.

524
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:02,290
And antigens are just kind of like the part of a virus or a bacteria or like a non

525
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:10,120
non-self material that your body will identify as being other and then try to eliminate.

526
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:15,790
So that can be proteins on the surface of like a viral capsid.

527
00:58:15,850 --> 00:58:21,760
Um, the one thing is that smallpox, you know, it's one of our early vaccines.

528
00:58:21,970 --> 00:58:28,090
There has been some refining of the vaccine over the centuries of its use,

529
00:58:28,510 --> 00:58:32,620
but it's still kind of a dirty vaccine in the sense that there are so many antigens in it.

530
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:35,590
And also smallpox is one of the largest viruses out there.

531
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:41,590
So actually, one smallpox vaccine contains 200 different antigens that your body responds to.

532
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:47,800
That's very different from vaccines nowadays, because much of the vaccines nowadays have been like purified and clean,

533
00:58:48,190 --> 00:58:55,990
so that you only respond to like one or two different antigens or potentially, you know, many fewer than the 200.

534
00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:06,850
Um, so somebody looked through all the vaccines which are currently being recommended and all of them together have fewer than 200 antigens,

535
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:14,020
which is all to say that, you know, once we stopped, once we stopped administering the smallpox vaccine,

536
00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:21,070
there was a huge drop off in actually how much our body had to mount an immune response to vaccine.

537
00:59:22,030 --> 00:59:27,220
So, you know, another way of thinking about this is it looks like there are so many more vaccines nowadays.

538
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:30,040
But in terms of like what is our body actually responding to?

539
00:59:30,310 --> 00:59:37,720
It's less than when there was a smallpox vaccine that was being regularly administered to people.

540
00:59:38,650 --> 00:59:45,580
But the other thing to think about is, you know, vaccines themselves regardless are, you know, much more purified than a typical pathogen.

541
00:59:45,580 --> 00:59:52,989
So like a bacterial throat infection, that's like 50 antigens that your body has to respond against day to day.

542
00:59:52,990 --> 00:59:59,320
Kids, you know, are messy, like licking everything and like getting exposed to all sorts of dirt.

543
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:06,640
And so it's estimated for like the average infant or toddler, they're exposed to over 2000 antigens in a given day.

544
01:00:06,670 --> 01:00:11,140
So like what people just, you know, we live in a world filled with germs.

545
01:00:11,530 --> 01:00:19,960
And what we're exposed to on a day to day basis is so much less than what the immunization schedule gives to you in its totality.

546
01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:27,060
And this is just like an interesting observation.

547
01:00:27,070 --> 01:00:33,100
I don't necessarily have much more to talk about about it, but, you know, in the US we like to stack up our vaccines.

548
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:37,240
So this is, you know, how we vaccine kids.

549
01:00:37,810 --> 01:00:43,620
We kind of have big doses at two, four, six months and a lot of these now are more convenient.

550
01:00:43,630 --> 01:00:52,900
Like we can combine the DTP here and into like a Pennsylvanian vaccine.

551
01:00:53,680 --> 01:01:00,940
So it's, you know, it's not necessarily that you'd have to give kids five different injections, but this is what we do.

552
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:08,410
Interestingly, for my work with Chinese colleagues, they in their clinics, they just tend to separate out things a lot more.

553
01:01:08,980 --> 01:01:17,710
So really kids are vaccinated in the they end up, you know, by the first year of age with the same immune profile as basically an American kid.

554
01:01:18,070 --> 01:01:24,250
But they separate out things into, you know, like coming back to the clinic for like your four and a half month versus your pilot visit.

555
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:29,950
Um, so I just think they have potentially a different perspective on administrations.

556
01:01:29,950 --> 01:01:31,059
But I will say that there, you know,

557
01:01:31,060 --> 01:01:40,510
there's been a bunch of work in like how effective and how safe it is to give a kid multiple vaccines at one point in time.

558
01:01:40,510 --> 01:01:47,590
And, you know, with very few exceptions, there's really not a change in the profile of how immunogenic the vaccine actually is.

559
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:56,710
And, you know, also in the United States, typically, ah, you know, my my recollection, I don't have kids,

560
01:01:56,800 --> 01:02:02,470
anyone but my recollection talking with friends who do and to my my siblings who have kids is that

561
01:02:02,470 --> 01:02:06,790
it's like kind of complicated to go to the doctor and get an appointment and things like that.

562
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:13,750
So I think in the US we just have this focus on if you're at the clinic, just get all the kids,

563
01:02:13,930 --> 01:02:19,300
get all the vaccines which are needed to minimize the amount of time that they need to like be coming back to the clinic.

564
01:02:19,670 --> 01:02:23,320
That would be different than in a setting where they have more of a streamlined process for vaccination.

565
01:02:26,450 --> 01:02:30,740
Okay. And then, you know, people are concerned about the chemicals that are in vaccines.

566
01:02:31,310 --> 01:02:35,150
This slide is just available for you to look at later as you have time.

567
01:02:36,170 --> 01:02:37,909
I'm not going to spend too much time on it right now,

568
01:02:37,910 --> 01:02:43,040
but it's true that there are chemicals in vaccines, just like everything is made up of the chemical.

569
01:02:43,950 --> 01:02:50,390
Um, but there are reasons why that's the case. Of course, there's the active component that's like the vaccine during, that's like the, the,

570
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:54,680
either the whole part of the bacteria or the virus or maybe like a purified part of it.

571
01:02:56,390 --> 01:03:00,560
There can be, you know, antibiotics and preservatives.

572
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:07,639
And the idea there is that we want we don't want like real live bacteria growing in our vaccine strains,

573
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:13,220
which, you know, could leave individuals vaccinated with like a septic shock or something.

574
01:03:14,420 --> 01:03:20,989
And there might be trace components related to the, um, the vaccine manufacturing process there, you know,

575
01:03:20,990 --> 01:03:29,360
typically will be some formaldehyde in some vaccines, but like the amount of formaldehyde in a vaccine is going to be much less than like in an apple.

576
01:03:29,810 --> 01:03:34,879
Like there's formaldehyde in everything. You know, I realize that really high concentrations that can do really bad things,

577
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:41,000
but at the amount that it's in an apple or it's in like any other fruit or in a vaccine, it's really not going to be good.

578
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:46,939
Okay. So what can we do to respond to people's concerns?

579
01:03:46,940 --> 01:03:56,180
And the one thing I also want to mention is that, like, sometimes you can't there's not any like bullet.

580
01:03:56,330 --> 01:04:00,590
There's there's not any silver bullet for like, how do you deal with somebody who is vaccine hesitant?

581
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:05,480
Um, there's no easy thing that you can do. I wish there was, but there isn't.

582
01:04:06,170 --> 01:04:13,940
First off, there's sort of like, what can we do on a political level where we can use vaccine waiver so basically we can require vaccines.

583
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:20,749
Um, this is something which very early on the Supreme Court of the US recognized that the government was able to do,

584
01:04:20,750 --> 01:04:24,530
and that was through the Jacobson versus Massachusetts case in 1905,

585
01:04:24,530 --> 01:04:30,170
which was related to the state of Massachusetts requiring somebody to be vaccinated against smallpox.

586
01:04:30,590 --> 01:04:32,810
And there was like a $5 fine if they did not.

587
01:04:33,170 --> 01:04:40,430
And, you know, a lot of the same concerns that that individual had or nowadays, I think that person kind of raised some religious objections to it.

588
01:04:42,260 --> 01:04:49,550
But, you know, it made its way all the way up to the Supreme Court. And the Supreme Court said that you could require vaccines.

589
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:55,609
And the idea behind this is through kind of like two different political theories.

590
01:04:55,610 --> 01:05:05,149
One is police powers and the other as parents, patriarchy, police powers is this idea that the government can protect the population.

591
01:05:05,150 --> 01:05:10,490
The government can regulate things to the extent to stop outbreaks from happening.

592
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:14,960
Parents raised this idea that the government can, in some circumstances,

593
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:24,170
operate similar to a guardian or a parent and so can, um, you know, do things that are in the best interest of its citizens.

594
01:05:25,730 --> 01:05:30,799
So but that's all to say also that vaccine waivers in the United States are instituted by the state, not the federal governments.

595
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:35,240
There's not like a federal mandate that can be put on for vaccines.

596
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:41,270
And we've seen that with cognitive there's not federal mandates where, um, how it, you know,

597
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:48,889
how it typically operates in the United States is that we make vaccines mandatory for school entry so that upon school entry,

598
01:05:48,890 --> 01:05:53,560
a parent has to show that their kid has gotten vaccinated. I mean, this is for public and private schools.

599
01:05:53,570 --> 01:05:56,480
I think a lot of times people think, oh, I'm going to private school. I don't get vaccines.

600
01:05:56,870 --> 01:06:03,440
But actually private schools, if they're licensed by the state, need to have the same rules as any public institution.

601
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:09,200
And the whole idea behind a waiver is that parents waive their kid's right to education during an outbreak.

602
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:15,800
So if there is, you know, a chicken pox outbreak that happens in suburban Detroit,

603
01:06:16,610 --> 01:06:21,650
if your kid is not vaccine against chicken pox, they're going to be taken out of the school for maybe up to 21 days.

604
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:29,530
So this is in 2017.

605
01:06:29,710 --> 01:06:38,170
And what you can see here is what I was saying is that Mississippi and West Virginia had no exemptions that were allowed.

606
01:06:38,170 --> 01:06:44,409
And medical exemptions, of course, are being allowed. But these other states either allow religious or personal belief exemptions.

607
01:06:44,410 --> 01:06:51,730
And then around, I think, 2015, 2016, California also got rid of their non-medical exemptions.

608
01:06:52,270 --> 01:06:58,960
And then in more recent years, New York mean Connecticut had also gotten away with various non-medical exemptions.

609
01:07:01,090 --> 01:07:04,060
Beyond that, we can also look at how hard it is to get an exemption.

610
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:13,450
So this is from before California and some states in the Northeast changed their vaccination policies.

611
01:07:13,450 --> 01:07:18,910
But basically, we were looking they were looking at how easy is it to get a waiver.

612
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:27,819
And so for a lot of places like in Wisconsin, North Dakota, it's like you download a form online, you sign it.

613
01:07:27,820 --> 01:07:33,040
And then when you enroll your kid in a school, you're like, Here I have my signed form saying that I'm not getting my kid vaccinated.

614
01:07:33,130 --> 01:07:42,610
That's obviously varies. In some other states, it requires like a health professionals signature, or in some states,

615
01:07:42,610 --> 01:07:45,790
they might actually require you to write a letter defending your choice.

616
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:55,580
So that's trying to deal with things on a governmental level. You can also think like what kind of promotions can we put out there?

617
01:07:56,630 --> 01:08:00,080
But unfortunately, it's really hard to change the minds of people who are vaccine hesitant.

618
01:08:00,650 --> 01:08:10,940
So this was a study and they used a multi arm randomized controlled trial to try to get people to think differently about vaccines.

619
01:08:11,540 --> 01:08:14,440
So they have a control group which weren't given anything.

620
01:08:14,710 --> 01:08:21,380
Then they had a correction group which basically was given a list of like these are the things which people say about vaccines,

621
01:08:21,380 --> 01:08:29,840
and this is why that's misinformation. There's one group talked a lot about the risks, like what are the risks of getting measles?

622
01:08:30,590 --> 01:08:35,000
There's a narrative. There would be like a personal story of like, oh, this kid got measles is pretty bad for them.

623
01:08:35,330 --> 01:08:40,220
And then there's images, you know, like a kid who had measles. You know, it looks it doesn't look great.

624
01:08:41,810 --> 01:08:48,020
And then they ask them a variety of questions, for instance. And these are just two of the items.

625
01:08:48,020 --> 01:08:50,690
But many of their other items had similar results.

626
01:08:50,690 --> 01:08:55,910
So if you asked vaccines cause autism, there's really not a significant difference from the control group.

627
01:08:56,450 --> 01:09:03,589
Like there wasn't a way to through any sort of messaging went through narratives or through pictures

628
01:09:03,590 --> 01:09:09,350
or through corrections to get people to change their minds about vaccines causing autism or like that.

629
01:09:09,350 --> 01:09:13,490
The vaccine has, you know, a high amount of side effects. So.

630
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:21,440
Randomized controlled trials like this one, which have tried out different types of messaging, have basically just found that it's,

631
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:28,910
you know, on these these one on 1 to 1 individual level interventions just like aren't doing much to change people's minds.

632
01:09:31,420 --> 01:09:37,690
One thing we could do is to try to use nudges in the idea of nudges is to use to

633
01:09:37,690 --> 01:09:43,780
make vaccines the default choice and to make opt outs to make it an opt out system.

634
01:09:43,780 --> 01:09:55,660
And out of the system on a lot of this was based on the work that Richard Thaler had done and he was an economist who got the Nobel Prize in 2017,

635
01:09:56,170 --> 01:09:59,680
and he didn't do this for vaccines, but it's been applied to vaccines.

636
01:10:00,130 --> 01:10:04,630
And so this is the last thing we'll talk about before you wrap up for the day.

637
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:12,700
And so parenting a doctor system today, your child is due for a DTaP and flu shots.

638
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:16,839
We'll give those at the end of the visit. Do you have any questions for parent b?

639
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:20,229
The doctor says your child needs a detached shot. Oh, if you want.

640
01:10:20,230 --> 01:10:23,500
You could also get the flu today. Do you want to do a flu, too?

641
01:10:26,230 --> 01:10:32,620
And I think it kind of becomes apparent that if you look at which parent is more likely to give their kid a flu vaccine,

642
01:10:32,620 --> 01:10:37,050
it's probably parenting because for parent B, you're kind of like passing off this choice,

643
01:10:37,060 --> 01:10:39,640
like, oh, do you really want to get a flu vaccine for your kid?

644
01:10:40,540 --> 01:10:45,040
But for parent a like the, the parent can still reject the parent and say, Oh, I don't want the flu vaccine.

645
01:10:45,250 --> 01:10:51,459
That still gives them that autonomy. But see, this is a nudge and it's just like a subtle way of presenting the default choice that you get

646
01:10:51,460 --> 01:10:58,750
this book and how it's turned out that from people recording different doctor conversations,

647
01:10:59,020 --> 01:11:03,759
this is often what happens. And then I just have an example of HPV.

648
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:12,820
We don't need to go through it. But people, doctors just like aren't great for presenting a vaccine as the default choice.

649
01:11:13,180 --> 01:11:21,370
And of course, these things get messy, you know, like if you are if you are, you have a huge patient population.

650
01:11:21,370 --> 01:11:28,749
If you do have parents come in that are really anti-vaccine, I'm sure you're trying to be a bit more careful with how you talk to them.

651
01:11:28,750 --> 01:11:32,500
But I think on the whole, doctors could probably improve their communication.

652
01:11:33,970 --> 01:11:43,690
So, you know, in summary, before the pandemic, the WTO said that vaccine hesitancy was one of ten threats to global health.

653
01:11:44,020 --> 01:11:47,650
And I think that we've seen that echoed throughout the pandemic.

654
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:57,640
And, you know, we have these images potentially in our head of vaccines, kind of being an object of disgust and being, you know, a painful thing.

655
01:11:59,260 --> 01:12:10,089
But there was this set of images that was commissioned by the Gates Foundation about trying to kind of present vaccines in an artsy,

656
01:12:10,090 --> 01:12:14,169
fancy way, which was more beautiful than, you know, the typical way we think about vaccines.

657
01:12:14,170 --> 01:12:24,580
So this is sort of just like an image of a muse of science, like giving Edward Jenner the idea of vaccinating a kid against.

658
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:28,150
Against smallpox.

659
01:12:28,420 --> 01:12:36,010
So maybe we can move towards there over time and thinking about vaccines as more of a regular part of a healthy lifestyle that is also,

660
01:12:36,190 --> 01:12:42,610
you know, this beautiful scientific accomplishment. So with that, I will stop for the day.

661
01:12:43,180 --> 01:12:50,270
Thanks again. 2 minutes for some questions.

662
01:12:50,270 --> 01:12:53,659
Thank you very much. Very informative and interesting. Thank you.

663
01:12:53,660 --> 01:12:58,490
Thank you. Any questions? I'm sure everyone just wants to, like,

664
01:12:58,730 --> 01:13:03,620
head out of school and get out there weekend and I'll be I'll stay here for a couple of minutes if you want to talk,

665
01:13:03,620 --> 01:13:05,390
but I hope everyone has a good weekend.
