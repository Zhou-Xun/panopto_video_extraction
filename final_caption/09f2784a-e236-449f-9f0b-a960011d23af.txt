Today's topic is overview of
qualitative research methods.

2
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,340
In this introductory section,
I'm going to talk about when and

3
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:16,040
how qualitative research methods can
be helpful to use in public health.

4
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,620
This module is designed to help you think
about the value added by integrating

5
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:24,600
qualitative methods into your public
health research and practice projects.

6
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,980
We have two learning objectives.

7
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,220
The first is to introduce you to
some important defining aspects

8
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,210
of qualitative research methods.

9
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:35,403
And two, to get you started to think about
when might we use qualitative research

10
00:00:35,403 --> 00:00:37,971
methods.
