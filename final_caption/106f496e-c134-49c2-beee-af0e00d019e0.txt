1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,520
Most of these are looking at like, please, can I get something?

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,660
I just I think I'm confused on like how to best specifically should we get.

3
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:16,490
You feel like you're looking at that where? In church you feel like.

4
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,350
Is the outcome. Like Where do you think this?

5
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,740
Anything you want to. We're in the modern, I guess.

6
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:36,540
Most of the. Yes.

7
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,990
Hey. So would it be okay if we met?

8
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:51,010
Yeah. And the same thing probably about life is that when the African.

9
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:57,380
Emphasis should be should it be on another part of the system?

10
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:15,070
I think in their presentation I was thinking. The data streams that you have access to, the analysis here, the interviews you did.

11
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:26,170
And it seems like just sitting here talking about I mean, because I agree,

12
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:29,580
I think it's like so fast, man, person, you know, it's like, this is personal.

13
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:37,780
But it's also just been fascinating over time just talking about.

14
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:44,650
Here to talk about how it works, just like the Washington schools.

15
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:50,729
I don't remember that person because she's always we've always talked about this like this

16
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:56,880
transition and how it doesn't work like that with WCC and and it's like getting better.

17
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:02,450
But it still seems to not work that well and like the health care system that my father favored.

18
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:06,850
And so I feel like all those issues of like.

19
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:16,800
Cross Systems connection to services online. What were their things like in your interview?

20
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,100
That people mention it like, oh, that seems.

21
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:30,130
I want to get out of here. You don't know anything about these quality interviews.

22
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:35,310
Not that that hurt, but I'm just thinking. Oh, I love it.

23
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:40,270
Sorry. It's just putting that into the context of this paper.

24
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:47,090
I was just trying to figure out how. Very disturbing.

25
00:02:48,410 --> 00:03:01,250
Yeah. And I would say to you for this paper, do you find this paper anything like.

26
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:10,970
You don't need to cover all the ground, but you could have like you could have like a big sort of disclaimer.

27
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:22,310
That says I can't cover everything and cannot see the gaps in what I cover, even like particularly in this type of I don't know.

28
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:31,960
I think these are all unaddressed topics. That certainly seems like a topic I.

29
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:42,570
Is that helpful? But yeah, I mean, I think maybe not.

30
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:46,580
Not worried about. Every big picture, but.

31
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:58,970
Maybe from the street. Yeah. I think that, you know, with all of your guys talk, it's probably like you try to be comprehensive about everything.

32
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:03,310
It's gonna be tough. And so I think sometimes saying, like.

33
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:09,490
We know there's like spending a paragraph in the front saying why there's this bigger world

34
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:16,750
and there things like how come you know how many colleges are funded or why people come,

35
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:22,550
you know, start your migration journey or what. There's all these things that I realized for my there.

36
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:29,560
They're not relevant to this topic, but my model is going to kind of focus on this piece of it.

37
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:40,200
You know, maybe where there's more, where there's like enough research that you can like pinpoint a gap as opposed to like we know nothing about,

38
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:45,100
you know, you because that is reality. Yeah.

39
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:52,840
And that's a good I think actually with all of your guys topics, they're they're all good in terms of that.

40
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,839
Like there's so much work to do.

41
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,650
But like the challenge will be that like hook into a piece.

42
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:05,350
Knowing that you know, career timeline and you're beginning.

43
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:10,250
Right. In terms of looking at this topic.

44
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,490
I think that's a you set of topics but influence your topic.

45
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:25,620
Yeah. I don't know if that helped. But I think all of you probably could have at this point.

46
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:29,790
It's like a disclaimer or like sometimes at a conceptual model.

47
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:34,919
What I was put in is always put in like time or age or development,

48
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:43,499
because I'm talking often about like if I'm talking about the particular developmental period and I just want to say like I know guys,

49
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,299
this can change over time, you know what I mean?

50
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:53,340
Like, I'll just put something kind of around the and say or like poverty or, you know, mean some big factor.

51
00:05:53,340 --> 00:06:01,950
But I know what not to look at, but obviously influencing whatever it is we're kind of trying to look into more and I think that's sort of new stuff.

52
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:06,719
That's my brain is really like a premium or something.

53
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:12,420
You know, if you're sort of saying, here's my pot, here's my money, like, let me just get out of the way.

54
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:17,720
Certain big factors that I can look at obviously are like setting the stage for this.

55
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:26,300
I think it. You know, one.

56
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:32,360
Yeah. And the other like paper stuff. So. Oh, just so that I'm clear.

57
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:37,640
Yeah. So you guys will get papers to me on 1130?

58
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,870
Yeah. Okay. Thank you so much. Oh, my gosh.

59
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:47,830
No. And I would say that we start. I just had to put in my phone.

60
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:54,810
Where's my phone? Yeah, like, whatever I can do to just be a resource.

61
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:59,830
I think that kind of thing is a good practice to sort of start.

62
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:04,470
To write about this stuff. I'm doing the from home. But I'm.

63
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:13,780
Yeah, right. A strong sense of.

64
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:21,440
It's not a time sensitive to steer.

65
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:33,180
So I'll give you guys feedback. So actually with those with your final papers, I think it.

66
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:43,610
Why don't you send them to me in Microsoft Word for like 10:00 or so, and I'm just so that I can edit not in any given media as I read.

67
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:47,720
Yeah, I think that would be easier. I feel like I've learned that for.

68
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:52,520
Campus life for the master's class.

69
00:07:52,520 --> 00:08:01,810
I try to I try to limit. I don't do that very purposefully and I try to be accurate for you guys think you know giving feedback about like.

70
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:10,010
My parts of the paper. So again, I would be awesome.

71
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:20,990
And then. And then we started to do the presentations on the things that we said, don't go on there at 1:30 a.m. You guys are on the center.

72
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:28,500
Okay. Um. I'm like, We're done.

73
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:35,000
How is everything else going? I mean, that's the point.

74
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:39,180
I mean, big thing. I mean, we have a couple things.

75
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:49,310
For 24 hours. I wrote in my headphones and my favorite euphoria.

76
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:53,850
I get that wrong? I think I'm okay.

77
00:08:54,340 --> 00:09:08,700
Think? Yeah. I've seen her before. Yeah, I know.

78
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:12,710
It's been interesting because I know that on Wednesday 23 people you.

79
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:23,480
Exactly right. The actor is out. She posted it as a positive, but it's due to the third piece on the Tuesday and Friday.

80
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:36,670
Yeah. I think it. I don't know. It's interesting. I feel like when people have taken that class with this class versus.

81
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:43,620
When they don't take it. Does this feels a little bit different in terms of pacing and more, but I don't know,

82
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:49,040
ask the second year because I'd be curious what they think is in place for their budget.

83
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:52,210
I'll take them together. Right. That doesn't.

84
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:58,350
It wasn't hard for us to understand people.

85
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:06,520
I think it has been like. I think it's. And I think that sometimes in your first year or two.

86
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:13,140
It's so big picture. I think that's. Really, I think.

87
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:20,279
My sex is only dependent on me. Like cool, you know, good thing.

88
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:24,050
But like, thinking about, okay, now what do I do? I don't.

89
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:32,580
You know. You know, I need to start talking to just like they're thinking about an individual.

90
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:41,990
Starting a research career is like, I'm going to take a bite out of this, like, right.

91
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:59,820
You know, which is that's. You're in the work force spending all this working out.

92
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:07,220
I'm trying to get back to. So we'll see how it goes next year.

93
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:12,010
Yeah. Yeah. Well, and that, you know, the people living in our neighborhood, right?

94
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:16,170
That's right. Now. That what Christy was saying to you guys?

95
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:21,110
We'll take. International development.

96
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:31,320
Any plans. That's. Requirements.

97
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:40,439
It does kind of seem I do like this kind of like model of big and small.

98
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:48,120
I think it is. Well, maybe it's just because this is the way to do it, you know, but to go first, this is my idea.

99
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,150
And then you go like, oh, this is what you get.

100
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:55,840
Yeah, yeah. It's definitely. Yeah.

101
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:02,630
It's like eventually. And everybody I think gets to that point playing.

102
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:11,230
No one one person. I like the team science approach in Texas so much.

103
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:17,350
And as long as they're certainly speaking knowledge and we're staying here, it's maybe knowledge.

104
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:26,690
Having to do everything is going to be wearing the everything that.

105
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:34,610
Now. I think it'll be good.

106
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:41,740
You know, it is interesting to hear from Christine and we all got the message, but it wasn't the nine credits because I think it's just the cognitive.

107
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:46,270
Oh, my God. No, no, no, no, no, no.

108
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:51,160
That's good. That's good. Awesome.

109
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:55,360
Okay. So, yeah, so today we'll talk about, like, a few.

110
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:03,230
Different things around team science and then also a bit around authorship,

111
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:08,710
because I think that's where really the rubber hits the road of certainly just working with teens.

112
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:16,700
And as a student, I feel like there's a there in kind of a unique position as you work with these different because

113
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:22,759
you work with various teams and then right at the end we'll talk about the data management stuff.

114
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:33,709
And just so you guys know, we may know already, but there are like new NIH requirements for that for data management and sharing plans.

115
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:42,830
And so those are starting on applications like as of January 25th, which is like when they always I don't know if there's a reason for this,

116
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:48,450
but they always seem to roll out the new versions of forms and things like January 25th.

117
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:49,519
It's those like applications.

118
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:56,870
But and so people who are submitting for February 1st or like because they need to have a lot more like information about this,

119
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:04,429
this is where it's good to be at a place like Michigan because there's so many people who are like on this issue.

120
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:08,360
And so we'll talk a little bit about that. It's called this data stewardship initiative.

121
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:13,370
But I think that that is going to be an interesting space over the next little while.

122
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:25,009
So if you guys are involved in proposals, there may be like it's kind of it usually starts whenever these like, yeah, like format and things changes.

123
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:28,069
There's like a little bit of the Wild West at first and people are doing things

124
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:31,220
lots of different ways and then really kind of settles into like what works well.

125
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:36,110
So right now, data management is all that like up for grabs. So you may see that.

126
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:46,940
Okay. So first let's talk about team science. So I feel like this team science like this is sort of a lot of our perspective already.

127
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:52,370
And this I just want to go through some things around like how we think about it and sort of

128
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:57,230
phases of team science kind of related to that idea of like one person can't do everything.

129
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:06,590
And then I think that it's, it's interesting because over the past, like few years, decade ish,

130
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:13,670
this has become much more of a like buzzword and value, but it definitely hadn't been for a long time.

131
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:19,220
And so I think that in public health, we're definitely already sitting in like team science of not,

132
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:22,820
you know, cross sector science and citizen science space,

133
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:33,770
but a lot of writing about it and thinking about it and applying it to basic lab based research is relatively new.

134
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:40,760
So I think that's interesting. And like, why are we in public health sitting in this space already?

135
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:44,120
Because we deal with these things that are like complex problems, right?

136
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:54,620
So anything, you know, that we'd be thinking about any of those issues has like interdisciplinary elements to it,

137
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:59,780
meaning like it would be helpful to have, you know, an economist,

138
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:05,660
an epidemiologist, an EPA trained person, a psychologist, like a lot of these different,

139
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:10,430
you know, endocrinologist looking at stress, you know, lots of different things.

140
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:22,250
Kind of play into that interdisciplinary lead and then moving to like solutions of these complex issues.

141
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:28,969
That's when we get into more of that like cross-sector piece, which that's not unique to public health,

142
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:35,990
but definitely where public health is more situated compared to some other disciplines where these things are studied.

143
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:41,960
And so it really does have big implications for kind of how we approach studying these these pieces.

144
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:51,379
So there's the interdisciplinary piece and the cross-sector piece, both important and I would say, you know, again,

145
00:16:51,380 --> 00:17:03,010
just thinking of the experience in the room, you guys all have, I think some of both of this, both of these and the cross-sector expertise.

146
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:14,749
I think, like it's really hard to accomplish that sometimes in a like in a Ph.D. career unless your

147
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:18,500
like particular research project you're working on like plops you into the middle of that.

148
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:24,300
So things like working with policymakers, working with community groups, you know,

149
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:32,240
talking to, you know, educators, you know, not in the university space.

150
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:42,770
So like that is, I think of cross-sector stuff sometimes as like a later career sort of goal,

151
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:54,079
but also engaging across sectors, if you can, to inform your work but you know and inform the implications of your work.

152
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:59,930
Yeah. Last I actually, I went to this MBA school of economics.

153
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:07,960
Oh. So there really a lot of these. These programs and their thinking on customer management.

154
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:12,260
So it was really important how to. Coming.

155
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:17,750
This sort of in their business out of. Comment it is.

156
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:27,590
Things like that. One of the things you say, I never thought that the MBA students may be.

157
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,840
They have a whole club for that. I was going to say, yeah, there's a lot of connections.

158
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:41,290
There used to be a program here where people kind of put together like a business plan and pitch it.

159
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:47,400
But what is there's like an entrepreneur social entrepreneurship program.

160
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:58,540
It's not like in the business school. You know something that I can't I can't remember that, but it's like a total Michigan thing, right?

161
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:05,759
Is just funny. See, so many good, smart people floating around, like working on some of these interconnected issues.

162
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:15,750
But it's great that you did that so that you can. Start to build relationships and also link with other students that project with us.

163
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:22,110
But yeah, it's called. Social innovation, social entrepreneur.

164
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:29,930
Something like that. There's a whole program and the business school and some of the master students that I know have taken classes in that space.

165
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:39,300
But they've done. A few years ago, there was a deep dive in firearms or a deep dive into like a topic,

166
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:44,190
and then they were just sort of generating innovative business solutions,

167
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:49,830
you know, which I think that's really good to kind of connect with because they.

168
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:56,880
Yeah, but that's the stuff that I think I had before taking a social entrepreneurship.

169
00:19:57,270 --> 00:20:03,150
Michigan Kyocera, of course. There's. Keep interrupting me when I'm saying how does it matter?

170
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:15,570
I mean, it's an interesting set. And again, that's something like socially conscious businesses, social entrepreneurship.

171
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:21,750
All of that is, again, relatively newer, which I'm like, come on.

172
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:25,580
You know, it's like a good place to tap into.

173
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:30,180
I feel like it's just so integrated and becoming more so when they're like,

174
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:35,430
definitely like large subsets of that kind of business world that are really invested in.

175
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:41,850
But they need public health like they need content, they need like understanding working communities.

176
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:47,190
They need so much of like what you guys know about.

177
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:54,750
So I think it's a really cool space. Lots of things with potential big impact.

178
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:58,670
So awesome. Okay.

179
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:08,989
One of the that one of those readings that is like teams and teams and tie team kind of like but I would so they talk about like mode one

180
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:19,870
science team science and Mode two team science and I would say like this is really something that you guys will like master in your PhD worlds,

181
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:23,030
right in your Ph.D. journey. So you'll get like theory.

182
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:31,370
You're based in this university setting. You're, you know, of the broad set of linked disciplines, I would say.

183
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:36,410
But you're kind of developing like your disciplinary identity in a way,

184
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:46,550
experiment focused is somewhat could be related to us, but it's certainly related in terms of like rebase class.

185
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:59,980
So like you'll learn the sort of, you know, in a tight research design, this is what we want to see like in under optimal conditions, right?

186
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:04,729
And like you really want to, you do want to master all this mode one stuff.

187
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:11,000
So quantitative skills you guys are all doing that hierarchical really refers to like the way it happens.

188
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,829
So like teacher to student investigator produce.

189
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:23,270
So it's like products that really live with you. So like publications, you know, products that emanate from your research.

190
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:32,390
This is all mode one science scientific autonomy really is a decent you're starting to get,

191
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:37,400
you know, develop that and figure out like what your niche is, what your thing will be.

192
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:45,080
And so I think that that sort of size and autonomy relates and then seeks universality is I think one of those,

193
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:49,430
you know, could be debated like is anything really, truly universal.

194
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:56,990
But it's sort of I think of it also as like generalizing knowledge, creating generalizable knowledge.

195
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:06,860
So, you know, you may have an interest in a particular population and that issue that you're studying may be super relevant to that population.

196
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:13,610
Maybe there's less universality of the thing that you're studying across all relevant to all populations.

197
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:22,549
But for that population, you're trying to generalize, create generalized generalizable knowledge that is important.

198
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:29,120
So that's all like kind of classic. I'm going to get a Ph.D. and these are the things I should be learning.

199
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:35,870
So I think it's kind of a good check in in a team science context or even an individual context.

200
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:40,429
But like that's a lot of rich. Like you could stop there and just be like, Wow, that's awesome.

201
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:42,680
That's really impressive. And I did all of those things.

202
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:53,690
But then again, like in public health, we like to think about mode to science, which is much more, you know, it integrates all these things.

203
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:58,880
I would say like you kind of have to have grounding in these things, which I think is really important.

204
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:02,420
But then in public health, we kind of got to like, okay,

205
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:11,450
so now let's move to Mode two and like use our theories, but apply them to public health problem.

206
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:17,629
And you know, instead of necessarily staying in the ivory tower and being university centric,

207
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:22,400
we want to be accountable to many and we want to sort of say like we're doing our research,

208
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:28,010
but we're having impact on public, we're having an impact on cross university people.

209
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:34,879
We're like reaching to community and here these don't totally line up nice to make like a little arrow, but like,

210
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:43,040
instead of staying within the discipline and again achieving a broad discipline, we want to think about being internal or transdisciplinary.

211
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:46,279
So like who around the university?

212
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:51,049
Like first, who in the school of Public Health, then who in the university?

213
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:52,700
Like, think about your cognates.

214
00:24:53,870 --> 00:25:02,689
Think about, you know, ultimately dissertation committee is not going who can bring in this like interdisciplinary space that I you know,

215
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:06,410
because I'm going to bring this I'm going to bring like the big view.

216
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:10,880
So who else do I need on my team to kind of take this to the next level?

217
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:21,830
Quantitative two mixed methods. We all know kind of how that important that is more flat versus hierarchical.

218
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:27,139
So this is sort of, like I said, teacher to student, it's kind of like who owns the knowledge, quote unquote.

219
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:32,180
So like here we're saying like there's a body of knowledge to be mastered,

220
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:37,790
which is like what you're doing reviews and writing and trying to really own the content.

221
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:43,609
And then here you're sort of like saying where is relevant information?

222
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:49,490
And it could kind of be anywhere. It could definitely come from communities who are impacted by the thing that I'm interested in.

223
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:53,270
It could be from prior research. Which is a little more hierarchical.

224
00:25:54,800 --> 00:26:02,270
The other thing here, and this is where I think like this individual or investigator produced two co-produced knowledge.

225
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:08,810
That's where like the authorship stuff comes up and data sharing and there's like a lot in that space.

226
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:13,070
But you want to make sure that you're doing, you know,

227
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:20,870
in your Ph.D. dissertation life like you have investigator produced knowledge like that comes from you that's attributable to you,

228
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:29,569
that's your publications and your sort of claim. And then in this move to science, we have more co-produced products, knowledge,

229
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:36,530
and that's where we get into like we've talked a little bit about some of this in terms of like compensating participants

230
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:43,970
who might provide really important knowledge and maybe they're like a community advisory board and are they on your papers?

231
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:47,990
So that's an example of like how that can sort of shift.

232
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:59,690
And then here like the scientific autonomy versus socially distributed, it's not really it's not like those don't line up as well.

233
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:02,149
But I would say that here in Mode two,

234
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:12,740
science is really trying to that give science away as opposed to like I'm sitting in my lab doing my some hands and then the idea of six universes,

235
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:18,379
universality or generalizable knowledge. But then you have to get into the local context.

236
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:23,660
And so I think all of these is kind of all of these like mode two things are what we I think,

237
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:34,070
value and a lot of us do but there they're definitely sort of like a next phase of science, of team science.

238
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:45,560
And I think then the other piece here is that in this mode to space, especially like where you're gathering information, if you have community input,

239
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:50,180
if you're getting lots of perspectives on the issue that you're studying,

240
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:56,470
you want to then go back to Mode one and say like, okay, now we know this, now what do we do?

241
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:01,870
Like, what's the next phase like? How does it important theory? You know, we thought this we went in with our theory.

242
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:07,370
We tried to do this whole project with the application and we found out that we need to change our theory.

243
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:08,989
So that would be, you know,

244
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:23,840
an example like moved to and for me another one science and what I think they do a nice job talking about is like the idea that they're

245
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:31,340
doing this sort of team science during Mode one and then you move toward Mode two and you co-produce knowledge that's relevant.

246
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:38,570
And then by doing this Mode two piece, then you move toward justice and equity in the things that we value.

247
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:48,020
So I think it's a nice way of to sort of and again, like not feeling like you need to do all of this in grad school,

248
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:57,319
but like some of you guys may get into projects that like can move into this mode to space more or already exists in the mode to space.

249
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:07,940
And you need to sort of pull it, you know, figure out how mode one science can be applied to the mode to activities that you're doing.

250
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:17,330
So I don't know if that's like a helpful distinction set of distinctions for people, but I think it's a good look at that.

251
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:25,220
And I go like, Wow, that's really a lot. But I think then way to kind of think about I think it's a useful kind of.

252
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:31,170
Distinction because again, like in your Ph.D.,

253
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:38,030
I don't think you can do the whole thing like an anybody in a career really can't really do a whole thing.

254
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:48,799
But it sort of allows you to like situate where your focus is and thinking career wise,

255
00:29:48,800 --> 00:30:01,700
like where where are spaces that I really like, enjoy that I'm good at that are productive and that I can find partners to do with.

256
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:10,280
And so I think sort of thinking about where, you know, even if you stay in one zone the whole time,

257
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:14,959
which I don't know that any of you will because of the nature of the things you're working on.

258
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:19,070
But it's still helpful to think about that work to.

259
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:25,620
Any thoughts? Questions. Distinctions.

260
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:37,050
Okay. So the other things that were like just in the meetings.

261
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:44,830
Oh, I put this up here, this just the download. It's just a good reference book.

262
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:49,070
It's like kind of some of those reference books that I put in the back of the syllabus,

263
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:55,229
like just to kind of stop the kind of like in case you guys need to teach a class like, you know,

264
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:59,460
about responsible clinical research one day or thinking about mode to science,

265
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:09,990
what are the kind of core research principles that might be important when working with like citizen science groups, community based groups?

266
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:15,930
And so I think it's sometimes good to have these like broad national patterning

267
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:21,149
pieces because I think they do a good job of like summarizing the key elements,

268
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:25,950
like what do we think is important in scientific research?

269
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:35,280
And like there's some goofy videos that that do kind of walk through these different, but I call it the our series of topics.

270
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:40,440
So we'll talk about some more of those. Okay. So how do we do this kind of team science?

271
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:48,750
And then this example was just sort of the, you know, the reading that was about like, oh, we have a collaborative lab.

272
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:53,009
This is how it came about and this is why it's helpful.

273
00:31:53,010 --> 00:32:02,040
And so whether it's maybe like at the MBA lab, a mixer or like a mini retreat with sort of different, you know, subgroups of research,

274
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:10,650
uh, you know, different research labs coming together, I think that building and those shared activities is important.

275
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:21,120
Um, and then I guess now I love those ten simple rules things, but I think that they do go through a lot of these like points about team science.

276
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:27,300
And I think they kind of boil down to these two things like, um, I think that habit, but.

277
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:38,950
And he's talking about the pace of science, I think is really important for the pace of different disciplines.

278
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:45,990
This program. That's okay.

279
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:51,910
Something. Oh yeah.

280
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:59,130
It was just like different. I always talk about different fields, have different terminologies, so I'm sure we already did that.

281
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:06,160
But it comes up like a really common way around searching, like, Oh, wait, there's nothing on this.

282
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:10,330
Oh, there's a whole field of this. But I just didn't know what to call that.

283
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:19,390
I'm not trying to be know. So it's like things. And then the other thing is that yeah, that different fields move at different speeds.

284
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,710
I think it's important to have. Ford models.

285
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:33,420
And so that idea of like just being open to different reward models comes up in authorship all the time and being patient,

286
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:41,970
both like learning a different field and liking the pace that the different that the field may need, need to like produce the paper or whatever it is.

287
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:48,210
And also recognizing when things don't work are working well.

288
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:56,730
So I know that you guys have all had various sort of team science and kind of experiences, but.

289
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:06,910
What do you what do you do you guys have any reflections on like I mean, I think what is your current setup you guys all have.

290
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:13,830
Different levels of team science engagement, probably like across disciplines here.

291
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:18,160
Is that true? I don't know. Maybe over time.

292
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:31,880
But any kind of life. Just. You know. Examples are challenges that come up for you guys so far in this space,

293
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:39,530
like working across disciplines or the little different when you're kind of working as a member of a team versus like trying to direct a team.

294
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:46,250
Yeah. I don't know if anything resonates. Yeah.

295
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:54,740
Some of those routine works, I think in the readings and talking about like the dispatch in terms of like technology and especially timelines.

296
00:34:55,250 --> 00:35:00,890
It's something that I have experience working with collaborators across the world and just understanding.

297
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:08,390
Mission responsibilities and what? On what constitutes like actually being an author.

298
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:25,590
Contributing. That's very different. What's your sense of how that plays out?

299
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:31,850
In our faultless calls.

300
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:40,420
So in the medical space, I think definitely there are people that were much less involved but also felt entitled to space on the paper and.

301
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:52,090
Actually pretty good. Her teeth are still in use. Sort of a pretty outline of the paper and it sort of lays out in one page like what the paper.

302
00:35:57,310 --> 00:36:01,000
There is like, something. They don't have to be in charge of it to be.

303
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:08,710
Responsible for. And that way there's a very. Are undocumented immigrants.

304
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:19,710
I'm about health clearance, not my. I'm not doing it.

305
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:25,530
So. Been to all.

306
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:43,160
That's certainly as I. Official numbers and recommendations and documents, but I like the pre assignment idea.

307
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:47,950
Did anybody like she let them do that? Not.

308
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:56,720
Work. I mean, I for. Like I said, you know, when you're offering something to me on paper and.

309
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,500
If they don't want to do it. They don't mind. And I think that.

310
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:20,550
Yeah. So I think it's been overall and I don't think it's just that people.

311
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:29,960
Consider it on. Some people to.

312
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:37,080
We'll see. Yes, that's a good thing. Without the.

313
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:52,170
The team we're working with, there are some. It's been a valiant effort, which can be a hard part team.

314
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:59,639
Because perspectives are really important. So the are totally different journals.

315
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:06,070
But yeah, it's a very different approach to. So.

316
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:16,570
Everything from. Sometimes it's about like gambling.

317
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:24,790
What's the main story? What journal do you have on the patient or other kinds of information?

318
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:43,600
Her son is. Talent also, if you like, different sort of competitions around the sun and that person is always on the paper.

319
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:50,980
My experience. Where and how.

320
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:55,160
There is more than that if you talk about this stuff.

321
00:38:57,140 --> 00:39:00,540
30 year longitudinal studies. All.

322
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:12,620
A lot of different. Different studies or like some study, some measure puts into measure to the study.

323
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:25,270
Like that puts that person forever. After that certain business is that person in high net worth more than 20% of all of these.

324
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:37,050
Two scenarios can happen. Especially as people in the institutions.

325
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:49,950
And how that has managed so. I want you guys to sign up at the very front for that.

326
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:59,040
That's a tricky transition space for sure. And even just like having a PSA and having had that experience, I.

327
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:06,640
Super awesome. We've got a few things which are totally dead, but it's like figuring out what needs to get done.

328
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:19,710
To. Sort of the same dynamics.

329
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:25,860
But let's see other things.

330
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:33,989
Oh, this is I kind of like to just go through this. I think the other settings thing too is like all of this is also relevant in the

331
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:40,469
community contexts and I think it's there's just fewer set out rules for how that works.

332
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:50,850
But I think. You know, personally, I have like with authorship and we'll talk more about authorship, but I've like, you know,

333
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:59,730
included the head of an agency on papers and said like, read this paper if you want to provide feedback, that's great.

334
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:05,010
And I would appreciate you reading this part carefully. And then you're an author on this paper, you know.

335
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:12,330
But again, like that reward structures part. Like for her like it didn't really she was like, I don't care how long this paper.

336
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:20,339
And I'm like, I think you should be on paper, you know, like so. But for her reward structure, it was like irrelevant to her.

337
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:26,070
She was on paper, but I thought it would be helpful. So just sort of talking those things through I think really is important.

338
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:35,630
And then this is sort of another and I think that's true this in science socialization for good.

339
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:42,020
But I think that I like to think about this kind of sequence because.

340
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:49,690
This can be kind of like within one's grad school experience or across one's career experience,

341
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:54,940
but these sort of levels of like interdisciplinary generic antennas.

342
00:41:56,590 --> 00:42:01,120
So this idea of just like I'm familiar with your discipline,

343
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:09,160
I kind of appreciate what you're doing and I integrate that perspective in my work, but like we're not really working together actively.

344
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:12,670
So it's sort of like an intro to interdisciplinary across disciplines.

345
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:21,790
So kind of functional like this as you can imagine, like the methodologies or somebody with like a really specific type of expertise like Oh,

346
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:31,779
I'm on the team, but I just kind of do this very specific role on the team and not like an integrated across all functions of the team.

347
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:36,819
Like maybe I only come to certain meetings because my stuff is only happening at

348
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:41,500
this certain point and that could be like a community recruiter person on the team,

349
00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:48,249
could be a methodology, just sort of like, Oh, now we're going to look at the qualitative data, let's bring you in kind of thing.

350
00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:56,559
And you know, and it's fine, but like it can sort of be a little tricky depending on what that person is wanting,

351
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,480
you know, what level of engagement they want.

352
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:05,260
Because it may be like somebody with a specific expertise says, please don't make me come to all the meetings.

353
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:06,820
I will pop in when I need it.

354
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:12,700
But another person with exactly the same expertise could be like, I don't feel like I'm part of this project and less about the meetings.

355
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:24,609
And so that's a that's a, I think a like a negotiable space, complementary or interdigital suited stage of interdisciplinary research.

356
00:43:24,610 --> 00:43:27,520
So we're working on a project together. Everybody is contributing,

357
00:43:28,870 --> 00:43:35,769
and we both sort of make key contributions to like the main research question in a way that like

358
00:43:35,770 --> 00:43:42,190
the research question would be sort of incomplete without one of the people more integrative.

359
00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:48,730
Like we really start like the whole project, like from start to finish, we're like sharing methods, we're combining methods.

360
00:43:49,810 --> 00:43:59,230
We're really both like invested in the research and then this idea of moving to move to or like a translational transformative.

361
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:08,200
But like we've done this sort of research, we've been gotten increasingly engaged in each other's like discipline and research methods.

362
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:18,009
And now we kind of bring that, you know, interdigital comprehensive interdisciplinary understanding to like across sectors.

363
00:44:18,010 --> 00:44:23,740
So that's just kind of another way to think about academic connection across time.

364
00:44:24,430 --> 00:44:29,860
And so I think the other thing to say is that like a person can be in different

365
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:34,450
roles across a lot of different research teams eventually like you guys will see.

366
00:44:35,410 --> 00:44:41,500
So like you could be getting into new discipline and just be like, Oh, what does this discipline say about my question?

367
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:42,690
I haven't thought about this before.

368
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:50,229
Let me look at like what the economists say, and then maybe you start to work with an economist, but in another team you're totally in this space.

369
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:53,380
So like your role can switch across to those different phases.

370
00:44:54,530 --> 00:44:59,239
Tom Chip so, so collaborative for health promotion.

371
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:04,460
This is like who's in the mode to mode in public health?

372
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:19,010
And I think that again, as you guys get ready for like race class, there's so many different ways to think about intervention and health promotion.

373
00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:30,020
And I would say like liberally borrowing from different disciplinary, you know, approaches is going to be helpful.

374
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:40,429
Even if it can be overwhelming, it's helpful to kind of just have a really broad way of thinking about all of these things at the start.

375
00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:47,900
And then eventually you'll kind of narrow down and do, you know, try one thing or a few things first,

376
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:53,120
and then you may kind of go back and scour around different disciplines again.

377
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:57,460
I said that already something probably.

378
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:05,690
But the other thing I just wanted to touch on is this idea of I think I said before,

379
00:46:05,690 --> 00:46:13,190
like citizen science and this article is another one by these guys is I think it's under like further reading,

380
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:21,229
but basically they're just talking about and I think what's nice about is I have some examples of participatory team science,

381
00:46:21,230 --> 00:46:28,520
which is kind of CPR to just to like make that link like I think of that as CPR.

382
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:32,569
And then this is kind of coming from a slightly different disciplinary perspective.

383
00:46:32,570 --> 00:46:36,170
So they're calling it something else. It's like a good example of that.

384
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:43,939
But I think this is I feel like and I don't know if you guys have this perspective too, but citizen science,

385
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:52,999
certainly in that sort of environmental health space, is like taking off and has taken off more recently in just recent years.

386
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,480
And of course, COVID sort of amped up some of that focus on this.

387
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:03,200
I think a lot of the work that we do is certainly could be citizen science.

388
00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:07,040
And so then what it makes me think about is like, okay,

389
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:13,880
how do we engage our community partners around citizen science with the same like level of like,

390
00:47:15,830 --> 00:47:26,719
like rigor or, you know, deliberation around how we, how we engage together as we do across disciplines like in academia.

391
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:30,860
So I think that's something to just sort of muse on a little bit and think about

392
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:37,250
if we're doing a really community based project and engaging community partners,

393
00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:45,610
what are some ways to, to. You know, just sort of be organized about that engagement.

394
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:48,970
And again, CB PR I think is a similar model to this.

395
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:55,450
But I just wanted to point out that sort of citizen science because again, in environmental health.

396
00:47:57,810 --> 00:48:04,709
You know, in terms of collect data, phone invoices, similar, if you guys have done photographs with a photo voice.

397
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:13,380
So people in the community of interest collect data and then also I'd say interpret the data with the researchers.

398
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:20,340
Right? So that's that's more engaged than collect the data and report back and give it to the researchers.

399
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:32,760
Right. So I think there's that same process of like increasing engagement and digitization on this community based citizen science work.

400
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:37,110
And so I like I was a conceptual model.

401
00:48:37,710 --> 00:48:48,450
So this is kind of their conceptual model of like how participatory team science kind of can go and across different phases of studying something.

402
00:48:48,450 --> 00:48:52,470
And I wouldn't even say like a research project because this is way bigger than like a research project,

403
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:58,379
but like across phases of thinking about a research project.

404
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:00,690
So this is sort of that interdisciplinary space,

405
00:49:00,690 --> 00:49:06,030
but it could be a parent representative on that when you're really starting to conceptualize a problem.

406
00:49:06,030 --> 00:49:11,400
So like having community engagement from the beginning of the problem.

407
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:17,520
And again, I think this is very coherent with public health and certainly our kind of future community approaches.

408
00:49:18,570 --> 00:49:25,320
But just to sort of spell out there are all these different team science phases and and each of these team science phases

409
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:31,889
like here we have parent representative there with a parent representative and policymaker and the conceptualization team.

410
00:49:31,890 --> 00:49:35,820
So like here, like, let's think about a problem, think about how we want to study it.

411
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:43,260
Here is how this is what's let's organize and put forth how we're going to study it.

412
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:47,219
So this would be like this is kind of like 800 level class.

413
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:56,250
Like think about what we want to study. This is more like the, you know, or other classes like here is what we're going to do to study this problem.

414
00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:02,790
And so, again, thinking about like what what stakeholders could be in this phase,

415
00:50:03,150 --> 00:50:11,280
implementation phase, this is doing the research actually implementation, implementing the goals.

416
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:19,769
And again, like we also have coalition representative and representative here and then translation phase feeding back the research.

417
00:50:19,770 --> 00:50:24,450
So I think this is kind of again like I know I love a lot of conceptual models,

418
00:50:24,450 --> 00:50:30,030
but I think this one was helpful in terms of just thinking through there's all these different stages of research.

419
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:41,930
And then these could be sort of players at each point in the research and actively thinking like, could I and with the research benefit.

420
00:50:41,930 --> 00:50:43,579
And I would think in public health, yes,

421
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:52,090
usually could benefit from integrating one of the community stakeholders into even these early phases of thinking about research, if you can.

422
00:50:54,110 --> 00:51:02,600
The other things they talked about in this one was, you know, you're sort of building your capacity to integrate the knowledge,

423
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:05,930
and then you also have to be attentive to these social interactions.

424
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:11,030
So this is kind of like where authorship of things come up. So those both are kind of balancing.

425
00:51:15,210 --> 00:51:19,050
Balancing the research goals. Let's see.

426
00:51:20,970 --> 00:51:26,670
Thinking about those different phases of like a research study.

427
00:51:26,670 --> 00:51:31,200
And this is an example of looking at pieces of childhood. So that's why they have parent representatives.

428
00:51:32,910 --> 00:51:42,870
What would be some challenges or tips or strategies to particularly engage community members at each stage?

429
00:51:43,330 --> 00:51:50,220
Do you think for what people have experience doing, you know, trying to engage community members at different stages of research?

430
00:51:53,940 --> 00:52:05,210
Thomas. It's like a big model. Or actually I feel like sometimes there's challenges of engaging.

431
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:09,500
Well, just say like I had found challenges of gauging effort.

432
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:16,340
Yeah, I'm kind of at this stage, it's not everybody's and that can be fine, but just,

433
00:52:16,430 --> 00:52:21,409
you know, that people are sort of can be less invested in that stage and like you think, oh,

434
00:52:21,410 --> 00:52:28,730
we're going to do this whole research project, and then we're going to create like a public facing report in addition to the paper,

435
00:52:29,510 --> 00:52:33,080
and then people sort of fall off at the public face and report perhaps.

436
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:40,580
Or like at this stage when you're sort of like really starting a project.

437
00:52:41,210 --> 00:52:50,370
Personally, I think that this can be really hard potentially to engage community members around that because it just is so abstract.

438
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:56,870
Like it could be that it's motivating and people are on board and discussing.

439
00:52:57,830 --> 00:53:03,770
You know, community violence or environmental toxicants or something like that.

440
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:07,780
And there's but then there's like a little bit of falling off here.

441
00:53:07,790 --> 00:53:12,950
Like, how are we going to actually study this and how are we going to get funding to study this?

442
00:53:13,070 --> 00:53:18,049
Who is involved in like the grant writing and measures and and people review measures, you know,

443
00:53:18,050 --> 00:53:22,820
so they feel like there's there's sort of a little bit of tension across these different

444
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:27,410
stages of ways that it could be a little bit challenging to engage people with,

445
00:53:27,410 --> 00:53:30,490
like, you know, limited time, which are going to have limited.

446
00:53:34,130 --> 00:53:38,020
Kind of thing, I guess providing like training or.

447
00:53:39,070 --> 00:53:49,670
Totally. I think. I think training is like a huge, huge piece and figuring out like,

448
00:53:50,700 --> 00:54:01,160
like there's that RC RS book and like committee members are not going to read that book, but like what are the core parts to know to do it?

449
00:54:03,090 --> 00:54:11,850
Yeah. And like understanding like I think it really in this conceptual is like this is sort of where I think most of us live our daily lives.

450
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:16,050
It's this conceptualization and really implementation of research.

451
00:54:16,890 --> 00:54:29,969
And so, um. Like these can be places where obviously researchers have so many skills and so much investment and a lot of resource to put towards that.

452
00:54:29,970 --> 00:54:36,060
And communities typically have less the community because they'd be more motivated to study it.

453
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:41,190
And they're certainly interested in, okay, what are you going to do based on this research?

454
00:54:41,190 --> 00:54:48,040
And so, you know, and to some degree, it does make sense to sort of shift focus,

455
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:59,420
but it's like how much how much balance between just like getting the stuff done and trying to get good input on all those cases.

456
00:54:59,430 --> 00:55:05,999
I think that's a hard balance sometimes and that's, you know, the community advisory boards can be helpful with that.

457
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:13,139
But like do you spend the community advisory board meeting like going over measures that seems

458
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:17,129
like a brutal use of a meeting that maybe you have a little breakout group from your reviews,

459
00:55:17,130 --> 00:55:18,480
the measures or something like that.

460
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:23,910
So I think that there are there's just these tensions that come up, I think, differently across these different phases.

461
00:55:23,910 --> 00:55:28,540
So. What else was I going to say?

462
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:33,910
Yeah, and I think, like, publications like right here. Um.

463
00:55:35,390 --> 00:55:40,070
Okay. Um. I think.

464
00:55:40,430 --> 00:55:44,569
Okay, just a few more things and let me take a little mini break, but I think we all know this.

465
00:55:44,570 --> 00:55:53,690
Partnerships are vital. I showed a slide and a lot of talks really, because I think that it's just good to pause for a moment.

466
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:57,350
I think in this room, we all deeply know this.

467
00:55:57,980 --> 00:56:07,910
But I think it's also really just always worth a little moment of reflection, because we actually already talked about business.

468
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:11,929
We talked about community partners, but there's so many different types of sectors.

469
00:56:11,930 --> 00:56:17,149
QUESTION And people just have those different reward structures.

470
00:56:17,150 --> 00:56:22,280
They have different priorities. They have different time, they have different training and they have different resources.

471
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:30,200
And like all of those things can make it deeply challenging to create and sustain partnerships.

472
00:56:31,580 --> 00:56:37,430
And then I think this is an important place to spend time at the beginning of this development research idea phase.

473
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:42,080
What people need to feel like a project is successful.

474
00:56:42,990 --> 00:56:48,440
I mean, ideally sustainable if it is successful, but like what is what is worth?

475
00:56:49,190 --> 00:56:54,079
Like spending our time and meetings about like why are we doing this and what's going to be the end goal?

476
00:56:54,080 --> 00:57:01,310
And that can be really different than the kind of the research, you know, part of the team, the community part of the team.

477
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:07,700
But that's important to do again upfront and then respecting that everybody's expertise is different.

478
00:57:09,690 --> 00:57:12,900
And that everybody's terms are different, which I think is always.

479
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:18,550
You know, even close inter-disciplinary work terms are different.

480
00:57:18,570 --> 00:57:26,310
So but I just love that image. It just sort of summarizes like a lot of stuff because.

481
00:57:26,990 --> 00:57:32,160
You have to go between people's minds across different languages, etc.

482
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:38,670
Um. Okay. And then the other thing is this idea of how do we make these things happen?

483
00:57:38,730 --> 00:57:47,370
And so that's another one of those like Little Ten Simple Rules things. And so networking requires doing, um, developing your pitch.

484
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:56,460
And so this is like, you know, you have to have sort of different types of pitches like we've done twice by conference poster pitching your poster.

485
00:57:56,460 --> 00:58:04,650
But then also like, how do I get my idea to either people of a different academic discipline people more broadly?

486
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:08,580
And that just sort of takes time and obviously depends on the project.

487
00:58:10,530 --> 00:58:16,889
Respecting differences of training, expertise, etc. said. And that you do have expertise in what others don't have.

488
00:58:16,890 --> 00:58:20,280
Because I think this is also something that's really important to remember,

489
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:24,780
especially at the beginning of your training, because you guys all have a lot of expertise.

490
00:58:25,830 --> 00:58:33,240
And then I think it's very easy to sit in a space and be like, Oh my gosh, I don't know what all these other people know,

491
00:58:34,230 --> 00:58:43,270
but you're there because here, you know, you've got an expertise to bring and you may not bring it in like that meeting, but it may happen over time.

492
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:47,580
So I think that's important to think about and it does take time to deeply collaborate.

493
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:53,969
So like to move across all those different phases of collaboration takes a lot of time and a lot of like that investment.

494
00:58:53,970 --> 00:59:00,000
Tired of just talking about ideas and talking about how we think about stuff and being open to suggestion.

495
00:59:00,630 --> 00:59:07,980
And I think that that like just as somebody who's done a lot of interdisciplinary space work and just sort of been in meetings where I'm like,

496
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:12,030
I really don't know what you guys are talking about, but it seems kind of cool to learn about.

497
00:59:12,030 --> 00:59:18,959
And here I have like a career's worth of knowledge of this thing, and I may not even ever invoke it in this new space.

498
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:26,760
And I think that's something to be okay with. And it does keep it a little more interesting, in my opinion, than just kind of doing the same thing.

499
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:30,750
People may differ on that, but that's my take.

500
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:37,880
I mean, I feel like I kind of do a similar thing in lots of different groups, but then I'm always like, Give me something new to think about.

501
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:43,350
Like, I need to be fed a little bit more, like broadly, you know?

502
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:54,389
Okay. And then so this one was actually from I like a sort of team science collaboration, team science guide.

503
00:59:54,390 --> 00:59:59,000
And so just put this up, you know, good to talk about all of these things that we know.

504
00:59:59,010 --> 01:00:06,959
These are all important, but this is a good reference. And so this idea of training and working with community groups,

505
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:11,910
if you're starting a collaboration like this, would be maybe a good place to go to get some resources.

506
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:17,950
And I think it's more like guiding principles is what I would say.

507
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:28,210
And. Oh, the one thing I haven't talked about here necessarily is this recognition and sharing success.

508
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:34,420
So like, again, in academia, for example, like success would be like our paper got published.

509
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:40,540
And sometimes that just comes out over email like, whew, this finally made it into print or whatever it is, or they accepted the paper.

510
01:00:40,540 --> 01:00:50,170
And like even within that academia space, there's not often as much like celebratory acknowledgment as like there could be.

511
01:00:52,420 --> 01:00:55,990
And so I think that's important to just note for any kind of achievement,

512
01:00:57,070 --> 01:01:02,530
but certainly also like across, you know, sectors, like having understanding,

513
01:01:02,530 --> 01:01:08,500
like recognizing everybody's efforts, maybe taking time to do a celebratory,

514
01:01:09,010 --> 01:01:12,219
you know, doesn't have to be a big celebratory event, but something to like.

515
01:01:12,220 --> 01:01:15,310
Mark Hey, this is an achievement that we've all done together.

516
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:24,610
You know, it's sometimes I really feel like that does fall off the radar because we're so focused on that implementation part.

517
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:28,809
But that's important. What else?

518
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:33,340
And I think also this idea of this comes with training to analytic team evolution of dynamics.

519
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:41,800
So like as people get sort of more expert. In whatever area they're looking at the roles shift.

520
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:47,019
And that is, again, something that happens I think a lot with students sort of like as you do on a team.

521
01:01:47,020 --> 01:01:53,079
And then you're like if you're like the most senior student on the team, then you're like, Oh my gosh, I know all these things.

522
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:59,260
And how what's my role now compared to where I was? So that's just sort of general team stuff.

523
01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:06,550
Okay. So I know that's a lot of talking about team science, but we can take a little mini.

524
01:02:06,730 --> 01:02:13,030
I think I have a little mini break and then we can talk about just authorship details and examples and stuff.

525
01:02:13,030 --> 01:02:17,840
I watch some little videos and then data sharing and Bowflex.

526
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:22,510
Cool. Okay.

527
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:21,630
It's coffee break. I heard yesterday.

528
01:04:23,260 --> 01:04:28,380
Faculty meeting yesterday. They said that the coffee in the cafe was not a pleasant.

529
01:04:30,260 --> 01:04:35,460
Originally it was supposed to be. You knew it was going to be.

530
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:40,120
Think. This was.

531
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:50,850
Self-service instruments like. So yeah, I stay positive, but I don't know.

532
01:04:50,860 --> 01:05:00,240
I think things are supposed to have improved. So this is like a discussion that was like an item in an Apple company because I think people are like.

533
01:05:04,190 --> 01:05:13,550
So. Oh, because I think that the self-serve machine, some sort of thing people are putting in shop like it's been tens of.

534
01:05:14,140 --> 01:05:22,070
Inability and not time to plan. I've used her on my.

535
01:05:29,740 --> 01:05:40,000
Like a cure. I've never seen anything like it. But I am like, why don't.

536
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:52,190
The airport actually has a flight. I don't know.

537
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:58,080
I guess we do it every day often. Yeah, because it's food, but it's.

538
01:05:59,030 --> 01:06:03,140
I've only seen it here at. Oh, the T.

539
01:06:03,580 --> 01:06:10,870
Yes, my husband and I. That's. But you know, you have to stop and think, I must have said this in there.

540
01:06:16,210 --> 01:06:20,800
Yeah, right. Well, I think I don't know if I've said this in here before.

541
01:06:21,140 --> 01:06:24,510
When they first opened that house, there was this building community.

542
01:06:27,170 --> 01:06:32,450
She left me her life. That was like the high minded kind of food.

543
01:06:33,020 --> 01:06:36,860
And people were like, you can't have that.

544
01:06:38,390 --> 01:06:43,850
You know? And, you know, like for a while, they had a really good, like,

545
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:49,440
caring person that was really serious and seemed to be even, you know, before they focused on.

546
01:06:52,540 --> 01:07:02,480
It'd be nice to. Yeah, it's so funny in public health and I was able to get outside of the kids where they have a little section that's like.

547
01:07:03,010 --> 01:07:14,549
Certain a certain number of people in this area. If nobody gives you the gift for normalcy and you're like, yes, the public have confidence.

548
01:07:14,550 --> 01:07:23,290
I don't think they're very. But I would have been like provide space for it, but nobody would use it.

549
01:07:24,090 --> 01:07:28,580
But you're deliberating, right? You go around the corner here and that's.

550
01:07:31,180 --> 01:07:37,560
And I think the first time was being in airports. I like a lot of sunsets from any room.

551
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:41,140
I was like, all contain this and it just seemed there never just.

552
01:07:41,590 --> 01:07:45,790
But you're right there. That's the first.

553
01:07:49,610 --> 01:07:57,540
Look at the something. The restaurant used to have the best looks, but.

554
01:08:00,130 --> 01:08:06,410
I guess I'm not telling you that enough that. Yeah.

555
01:08:06,590 --> 01:08:10,010
I never heard airplanes, like, in my life, so.

556
01:08:11,450 --> 01:08:16,600
Well, don't turn it. These are the things I like. You know, the reason why.

557
01:08:17,490 --> 01:08:23,120
Section of. I'm super.

558
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:31,760
And so it's like a little for Christmas. He's not that funny that.

559
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:44,160
And I just want to point out that something like helped me because my baby, whom I really love, is going to take me to the bathroom of my class.

560
01:08:44,210 --> 01:09:02,450
So for a year, she was. Well, it's tough in this space, as I think my lab manager, except for the fact that I have asthma, Nancy.

561
01:09:02,460 --> 01:09:06,400
And he was like this kind of disease, like.

562
01:09:07,130 --> 01:09:13,030
People's lives in the house have been smoking. And so we're trying to figure out how to do this.

563
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:20,379
And I. So I guess they got this piece that was he said it seemed to really work somehow fine

564
01:09:20,380 --> 01:09:27,470
as with something that's already in the paint or in the walls or the smoke and stuff.

565
01:09:27,490 --> 01:09:30,730
And I was like, How's it working? I think it's okay. I think it's okay.

566
01:09:30,750 --> 01:09:36,520
We got lucky. Really. Stephanie, what is.

567
01:09:37,460 --> 01:09:44,780
Yeah, it's hard to just kind of. In October.

568
01:09:47,980 --> 01:09:51,570
Tennis tournament before Grand Rapids. I'm here to stand up to tell that.

569
01:09:54,270 --> 01:09:57,690
I'm pretty sure that I would have been smoking it,

570
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:07,410
but there were always signs about smoking and it was like of any substance and it's just like it was like reefer madness.

571
01:10:08,930 --> 01:10:17,910
Oh, well, you could fill it with smoke and we will put like towels under their room and I would just crack because were always high school boys.

572
01:10:17,930 --> 01:10:22,430
So it's like I'm certain they're all pretty aware of this.

573
01:10:22,430 --> 01:10:27,200
I'm assuming it's not in their brains because they're all people toasting guys that are with their parents.

574
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:35,820
But it was just such a whole other whole level of experience, you know, and that was everywhere.

575
01:10:36,620 --> 01:10:40,100
But yeah, I know it's a hard one. That's a hard, hard to get.

576
01:10:40,150 --> 01:10:45,500
I feel bad for that. Anyway, he was saying they were doing this like paint and he's like, I'm sure there's extra time.

577
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:51,649
So he said they wore masks as they painted because he's like in order that they have this special insurance like paper toxic

578
01:10:51,650 --> 01:10:57,500
in a of people like you can't wear environmental health like there's always something you know you just don't know about it.

579
01:10:58,940 --> 01:11:03,240
Yeah, so interesting. But I think they redid the carpet too, so.

580
01:11:04,580 --> 01:11:12,600
Yeah, I know. It's a lot. I, you know, it's funny, cause I see a lot of the same things from Sanger, and.

581
01:11:13,790 --> 01:11:20,140
But it's like, such an awful lot. Like, a lot more every, like, like that's why so.

582
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:25,430
But I. It'll be interesting to see how it comes back in person or how that.

583
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:36,290
This is the thing that I feel like. Is it officially my.

584
01:11:38,510 --> 01:11:41,650
There was snow there in the distance now.

585
01:11:41,660 --> 01:11:48,110
So check that out, you know. How do you see it as the morning?

586
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:54,180
I happen to be in play on the silver for.

587
01:11:55,270 --> 01:12:06,470
I think I always have frostbite. So that was kind of like cause I didn't want the snow climbing on my car.

588
01:12:06,530 --> 01:12:10,370
Like 530 in the morning trying to clean it up.

589
01:12:10,790 --> 01:12:13,889
Somebody looked out the window. Oh, yeah.

590
01:12:13,890 --> 01:12:19,640
I think you could get a fence using a credit card or like a credit card just to break the ice.

591
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:26,210
But I just get it. Yes. Like the long brush about scraping.

592
01:12:29,710 --> 01:12:36,020
But I didn't even see, you know, I thought it would be nice here in the restaurant,

593
01:12:36,040 --> 01:12:42,100
but I really thought that I was already signed, so I might as well.

594
01:12:42,830 --> 01:12:48,370
My arms are. Poor.

595
01:12:55,190 --> 01:12:58,470
Never heard of the Enlightenment.

596
01:12:59,060 --> 01:13:03,750
Maybe not the last thing I've seen. I don't know how thick my glasses are.

597
01:13:03,780 --> 01:13:06,200
Maybe. I think I wouldn't.

598
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:13,840
To high temperature contrast and but then the other problem is that back you come back to me and that's going to be frozen and ice.

599
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:18,809
That's true. That's the worst. Yeah, I think that's the worst thing.

600
01:13:18,810 --> 01:13:22,490
Not in our heads. Nice. Nice to see. Yeah, I know, Ralph.

601
01:13:22,490 --> 01:13:26,330
It's so dark. Right. What's happening?

602
01:13:29,190 --> 01:13:37,890
Well, it isn't cardiology. They teach you how to do. It's just the anticipation of possibly being.

603
01:13:38,780 --> 01:13:47,989
We are like actually my dad is like talking through a few like I have been through it and I'm like, it's not the actual it's happening.

604
01:13:47,990 --> 01:13:54,110
It's the like it's like the unexpected or the part too.

605
01:13:54,470 --> 01:14:01,280
I don't know what it is, but. But I heard so many accidents of my.

606
01:14:02,590 --> 01:14:06,639
People like things out there. I only hear it. And then I look at the actors.

607
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:12,030
I don't know where it is. I'm not really. But they they get an active.

608
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:20,320
There's just a few spots like what's going on here on the west side.

609
01:14:20,820 --> 01:14:24,830
And there's like one. There's one particular thing.

610
01:14:25,580 --> 01:14:31,310
You never stop playing. I actually. I just hope by coming up.

611
01:14:32,990 --> 01:14:37,400
That might cause people to slide down?

612
01:14:37,420 --> 01:14:42,880
Not always. I'm starting to spit out some.

613
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:49,120
I'm just going to wait and see what's going to be in the latest episode of that.

614
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:54,490
HILL And it's like a mini hill like my, like that's the but I feel like I think Barbara is very quiet,

615
01:14:54,580 --> 01:15:00,350
but there are certain like little parts where it's almost like, what the [INAUDIBLE], like.

616
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:06,440
Lemon joins us now. He space is flat.

617
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:09,590
But there's so many.

618
01:15:14,030 --> 01:15:23,010
But that's a lot of times figuring out where it's right.

619
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:26,410
It's like, well, the next moment is, like, flat out beautiful.

620
01:15:27,060 --> 01:15:34,500
What about some structure? If you have any tips, do this.

621
01:15:36,650 --> 01:15:42,350
So I remember very. The parking lot with the personnel.

622
01:15:43,290 --> 01:15:46,390
She read music? I think, regardless of controls.

623
01:15:49,010 --> 01:15:49,730
That is smart.

624
01:15:50,210 --> 01:15:56,550
And that's one that I think is important because I don't think you guys are going to be the problem when you're driving down the street.

625
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:06,709
I was my 15 year old son, really?

626
01:16:06,710 --> 01:16:12,440
From my elementary school parking lot in my mom's minivan.

627
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:27,570
The Texas version of that is my dad took me to. You know, although I think you get used to driving around.

628
01:16:28,060 --> 01:16:32,170
But while they. I think that's great.

629
01:16:32,260 --> 01:16:44,940
I think it's a growth area. I'm not like, Oh, yeah, you can't remove the stock from my current world.

630
01:16:45,510 --> 01:16:49,740
I don't like that. I did high school football myself.

631
01:16:53,620 --> 01:17:02,210
I haven't had to drive. Yes, it was the whole thing was very, very, very.

632
01:17:06,540 --> 01:17:11,950
He was to. In North Carolina.

633
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:19,810
That is where. Yeah.

634
01:17:19,830 --> 01:17:24,280
In Texas, we lost power of the whole state, basically shut down.

635
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:28,990
The water was gone. It was like the ice age. It's bad.

636
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:33,710
You get tired of that somewhere? You. And I heard that all.

637
01:17:35,550 --> 01:17:45,870
If you're like one pastor, I think it's like. I'm certain that some of the mainstream media have tried to sound like I'm trying

638
01:17:45,990 --> 01:17:49,620
to change right up here on in that cut off and cut through there all the time.

639
01:17:49,620 --> 01:17:55,350
Because I'm learning and I'm. And honestly, if.

640
01:17:57,340 --> 01:18:02,890
I know that really nice balance thing because that's what I care.

641
01:18:05,630 --> 01:18:09,420
Here's ice. I just have to look solid.

642
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:15,950
Yeah, but they have some friends. An insurance policy.

643
01:18:15,970 --> 01:18:27,440
That's another way that I recommend you. You might want to think about how they are.

644
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:34,360
So I have three kids. A litter sample of just 96.

645
01:18:37,770 --> 01:18:43,200
Made in Mexico on water. Yeah. And we're in California, too.

646
01:18:45,660 --> 01:18:50,790
My mom was carrying a massive earthquake through Teamster.

647
01:18:51,650 --> 01:18:58,070
So she was a big fan of like disaster prep. But really one of those you have to be.

648
01:19:03,950 --> 01:19:07,910
Well, I'll bet they keep you there. Yeah.

649
01:19:08,230 --> 01:19:14,530
Yeah. Oh, goodness.

650
01:19:17,710 --> 01:19:31,770
Oh, yeah. I prefer snow, but yeah, it's not quite it's not like all the leaves are gone and there was snow on the ground.

651
01:19:35,290 --> 01:19:38,370
Right, right. I think I told you earlier.

652
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:43,310
No, really. Yeah, I know.

653
01:19:43,630 --> 01:19:48,610
You're like, Oh, yeah, I remember the number. So it was funny.

654
01:19:49,940 --> 01:19:53,350
Oh. Oh, goodness. Oh, goodness. Yeah.

655
01:19:54,030 --> 01:20:03,940
Um, okay. Let's see, let's talk a little more about partners after 17 teams settings.

656
01:20:06,280 --> 01:20:11,050
So these are I don't know if everybody's familiar with these guidelines.

657
01:20:11,380 --> 01:20:22,990
Um, I see IMG guidelines, but these are sort of the big ones in terms of how you evaluate, like, what authorship is.

658
01:20:24,490 --> 01:20:27,430
And Amy's document is probably much more details than this.

659
01:20:27,430 --> 01:20:36,549
But the idea of, okay, this person has made substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work.

660
01:20:36,550 --> 01:20:40,000
So that's usually like the team that got the study funded.

661
01:20:40,240 --> 01:20:46,240
If you're talking about funded research project or acquisition analysis interpretation of data.

662
01:20:46,240 --> 01:20:55,129
So like. You know, there's some details in here, too, you know, that can totally vary across teams.

663
01:20:55,130 --> 01:21:01,670
And so something that sometimes comes up is like if somebody just did data acquisition, somebody just did data analysis.

664
01:21:03,230 --> 01:21:09,980
Does that count as authorship? And that really is sort of like a team dynamic, but.

665
01:21:12,030 --> 01:21:16,319
It's I think it sort of depends also the phase of the project,

666
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:20,610
like somebody can be sort of you guys might have had this experience that like being really

667
01:21:20,610 --> 01:21:27,390
involved in like setting up plans for data collection and then like left the project.

668
01:21:27,690 --> 01:21:38,550
And like usually that does not constitute authorship, but if somebody's been with the project the whole time, they're like the project manager.

669
01:21:39,330 --> 01:21:45,960
They've like, you know, done all the data acquisition and planning and recruitment and all that stuff.

670
01:21:47,100 --> 01:21:52,820
In my view, like, if that person wants to be an author, they do need to do some paper writing tasks.

671
01:21:52,830 --> 01:21:56,489
But I would be like, Yeah, come on board, be an author.

672
01:21:56,490 --> 01:21:59,340
But not everybody like that. That carries a lot.

673
01:21:59,340 --> 01:22:07,800
So like that sort of like integral research staff role compared to authorship can can definitely be like a split.

674
01:22:11,190 --> 01:22:19,020
So I think the interpretation is important here, like drafting the work, revising it, critically important title content.

675
01:22:20,550 --> 01:22:24,510
And so those are and like you're supposed to do both of those things and final

676
01:22:24,510 --> 01:22:28,550
approval of the manuscript to be published and agreed to be accountable.

677
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:36,300
So like if you do meet all of those things, so like not only giving feedback on the paper but having been involved in some aspect of the planning,

678
01:22:37,290 --> 01:22:42,780
some aspect of the writing, and then you're kind of like on the hook for those things.

679
01:22:43,980 --> 01:22:47,190
That is what authorship should be part of these guidelines.

680
01:22:47,770 --> 01:23:00,630
At least on some of Dr. Drew on this. Do I forget to know whether or not the ones they like spelled out like each person's contribution to the paper?

681
01:23:00,660 --> 01:23:03,690
Yes. Like the final version. Yes, that's true. That's.

682
01:23:04,790 --> 01:23:07,880
Really? Yeah, I think. Yeah, that has been an increasing.

683
01:23:08,570 --> 01:23:17,780
Sort of like that with seniors. And especially in the medical journal space, which is sort of where that started.

684
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:22,470
But absolutely. Becoming more. Yeah, like standard.

685
01:23:22,740 --> 01:23:27,020
I like what they told. Yeah.

686
01:23:27,020 --> 01:23:34,190
And it should be kind of along these lines of these should be what, you know, if one is contemplating authorship.

687
01:23:34,190 --> 01:23:43,910
And so then again, like thinking about. A tool to structure authorship tasks for a project should align with these.

688
01:23:45,530 --> 01:23:49,820
Buckets and.

689
01:23:52,070 --> 01:23:55,730
I think I mean, I don't know.

690
01:23:55,740 --> 01:24:03,440
I've been on so many of these big teams and then paper that I've been like substantially involved in this part.

691
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:09,560
And then a paper will come to me that's like pretty much written pretty good.

692
01:24:10,940 --> 01:24:13,709
And then I feel like, well, thanks for including me on the paper.

693
01:24:13,710 --> 01:24:18,560
And so then I will try to give it a lot of feedback and, you know, input and interpretation.

694
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:25,970
And there usually is because usually if that happens, it's like a medical student, medical trained person who is working with somebody on the team.

695
01:24:26,930 --> 01:24:32,390
And so then I'll like give it like a public health or developmental psychology type spin and then I feel like I've contributed.

696
01:24:34,160 --> 01:24:37,480
So, but, you know, this can just play out in so many different ways.

697
01:24:37,510 --> 01:24:44,989
I think really that research staff way is sometimes it can just be a challenge because some peers are just like,

698
01:24:44,990 --> 01:24:47,990
no, that is like not an authorship category ever.

699
01:24:48,410 --> 01:24:51,590
And then some are probably like overly inclusive.

700
01:24:52,730 --> 01:24:58,220
And then you have a lot of people on paper and it's unwieldy because you have a lot of like maybe people who are,

701
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:02,540
you know, are just learning how to write papers. And so.

702
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:11,250
I think that's a balance to think about. Like how many students, how many, you know, parties that have been working on to do the lit review,

703
01:25:11,260 --> 01:25:17,580
like did they write the lit review or did they kind of gather the papers and summarize their details like.

704
01:25:18,460 --> 01:25:25,750
Those. I think that comes up a lot. Like with MPH students maybe who want to be on papers or undergraduates who want to go to,

705
01:25:25,960 --> 01:25:29,590
you know, Ph.D. Chronicles like grad school and you need papers.

706
01:25:31,210 --> 01:25:34,960
So I think those can be hard spaces to navigate.

707
01:25:34,970 --> 01:25:39,550
Sometimes it's good to have these guidelines, but even better to have like the pre structure.

708
01:25:42,850 --> 01:25:48,160
High level. I was on the with. Like submit to the vines like.

709
01:25:48,980 --> 01:25:54,890
To work on a specific part of the broadcast so that there was an update.

710
01:25:57,130 --> 01:26:01,180
Keep the perspective. The data, which I thought was yeah.

711
01:26:01,660 --> 01:26:06,550
And I think yeah, certainly as you get like bigger teams and then I think there is that again that

712
01:26:06,850 --> 01:26:11,590
the team science idea that the disciplinary overlays of ones expected and so.

713
01:26:12,770 --> 01:26:16,819
No. In public health. We sometimes have papers with just a few authors,

714
01:26:16,820 --> 01:26:23,389
but we very often have papers with a lot of authors and that if we talk to like genetics people, there's like 200 authors.

715
01:26:23,390 --> 01:26:27,920
And so what does that mean? You know what I mean in terms of the authors?

716
01:26:28,640 --> 01:26:32,840
Did that really meet all these guidelines? But that's those are medical papers.

717
01:26:32,840 --> 01:26:34,520
And there are there are hundreds of authors.

718
01:26:36,260 --> 01:26:43,010
And so it's interesting because Scott is sort of he's on some papers like that just because of the ethics genetics piece that he does.

719
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:46,820
But he's like, but I'm not a geneticist. Like, it's totally not the norm for me.

720
01:26:46,820 --> 01:26:53,000
So I just feel weird to be on those papers, but that's the norm for them so that I'm on the papers that I was part of a bigger project.

721
01:26:53,000 --> 01:27:00,050
So yeah, there's, there's a lot of different, you know what, if you look, if you're somebody who does a lot of interdisciplinary team science,

722
01:27:01,730 --> 01:27:09,260
like I look at my CV and it's very, it represents the fact that I have different models of publishing with different people.

723
01:27:09,260 --> 01:27:12,479
So. It's interesting.

724
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:21,959
And the other thing that, again, I don't know if I said this specifically, but the thing that can come up here, too,

725
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:27,430
in terms of like authorship order is the issue of like who is first off,

726
01:27:27,480 --> 01:27:34,080
like what valued positions there are and authorship and again, apart from the medical kind of field.

727
01:27:34,710 --> 01:27:41,440
Last authorship is sort of senior authorship. Often that didn't always used to be the case in some other disciplines.

728
01:27:41,440 --> 01:27:44,610
So like psychology has kind of been slower to adopt that model.

729
01:27:45,750 --> 01:27:51,540
And so I joke, I have many papers on which I'm senior author to last and then I have some papers, you know,

730
01:27:51,540 --> 01:27:58,169
from more psychology type journals and certainly earlier on where I'm just like straight last, like I'm not senior at all.

731
01:27:58,170 --> 01:28:00,510
I'm like the last author on that paper.

732
01:28:00,510 --> 01:28:09,450
But so to start interpreting and this comes up to like, you know, for things like in academia, like tenure review cases,

733
01:28:09,450 --> 01:28:16,649
like how you so if you're aware that like you're maybe going to be on some papers with like cross disciplinary

734
01:28:16,650 --> 01:28:24,210
teams or interdisciplinary teams and having a little statement or way to like annotate your CV about that,

735
01:28:24,270 --> 01:28:29,129
you know, like, or who's a student because that's valued.

736
01:28:29,130 --> 01:28:35,460
Like if a student is first author or some other second author and someone's last author, those are valued positions.

737
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:46,230
Increasingly, you also see a few a few papers usually like coauthored by like not that many people, but where they share first authorship.

738
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:50,220
And there's like a little statement that says authorship was determined alphabetically.

739
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:52,139
I think that's great.

740
01:28:52,140 --> 01:28:58,170
But now, of course, it doesn't solve the problem like one person's name is first and like it's really hard to switch that mindset.

741
01:28:58,170 --> 01:29:07,950
And so I think if one is in that situation like that used to be like bolded or something on your CV sort of somebody is looking at your CV,

742
01:29:07,950 --> 01:29:11,800
they say like, okay, that was really shared first authorship. Um.

743
01:29:12,250 --> 01:29:15,350
So there's, like, a lot of these. Finesse.

744
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:24,320
Ways to finesse, you know, the representation of your authorship to be accurate, you know, to reflect effort.

745
01:29:27,170 --> 01:29:33,140
So let's see. So this is an example so we can sort of ponder.

746
01:29:33,980 --> 01:29:39,640
So Robert has been working in a large engineering company for three years following his postdoctoral fellowship.

747
01:29:39,680 --> 01:29:43,580
So after postdoc he's like all minted and this is his job.

748
01:29:44,750 --> 01:29:51,920
Using computer simulations, he's developed a method to constrain the turbulent mixing that occurs in the walls of Tokamak Fusion Reactor.

749
01:29:52,610 --> 01:29:57,380
He has written a paper for physical review, submitted to the head of his research group for review.

750
01:29:57,500 --> 01:30:00,920
So his current place, head of the group, says the paper's fine.

751
01:30:00,920 --> 01:30:04,610
But a supervisor who needs to be included is author Robert Nisbet.

752
01:30:04,610 --> 01:30:08,390
A supervisor did not make any intellectual contribution to the paper.

753
01:30:09,140 --> 01:30:10,640
How should he respond?

754
01:30:10,820 --> 01:30:19,010
What ways make it possible to appeal to the company and what other resources exist that he could use in dealing with this issue?

755
01:30:19,490 --> 01:30:31,150
So. What? I know that's an incredible opportunity that.

756
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:42,580
Maybe if. And papers are now requiring that we publish on the paper that everybody has done that.

757
01:30:42,580 --> 01:30:48,309
Should I be afraid to like post that, to wonder what would you like to review after.

758
01:30:48,310 --> 01:30:52,780
I think back then, yeah. As a supervisor. That's right.

759
01:30:53,010 --> 01:30:58,990
Right. But yeah, I like that appealing to like this structure and say, okay, here are the guidelines.

760
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:18,069
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

761
01:31:18,070 --> 01:31:21,550
Acknowledgment that that's always a that's always a good option for sure.

762
01:31:23,950 --> 01:31:28,360
He could definitely have checked in earlier in the process too,

763
01:31:29,650 --> 01:31:33,760
which is good because they sort of present it like he's got this whole paper ready to go.

764
01:31:37,640 --> 01:31:41,080
And you know, some of the head of the research person said it probably.

765
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:45,120
Yeah, that's right. Yeah. Yeah.

766
01:31:45,890 --> 01:31:49,640
Um. You know, and we can you know,

767
01:31:49,640 --> 01:32:00,360
obviously this is like a different domain and that honorary authorship concept feels like it really is more of an acknowledgment.

768
01:32:01,220 --> 01:32:08,900
Um, you know, another actually back to team science sometimes if you're part of a bigger working group,

769
01:32:08,900 --> 01:32:15,050
like I don't know if healthy minds might do this, but if you, if there's a statement that says like the Healthy Minds team, you know,

770
01:32:15,080 --> 01:32:21,170
contributed to this research or like this working group contributed to this research, and then you can list the names of the group.

771
01:32:22,370 --> 01:32:25,940
If it's sort of a defined group in the acknowledgments section,

772
01:32:26,540 --> 01:32:36,619
it could be as an acknowledgments or even I feel like I've seen it kind of underneath the main list of authors and it's a little bit weird.

773
01:32:36,620 --> 01:32:43,310
I've been involved in some of things like that and like it pops up in my well, Google Scholar takes everything.

774
01:32:43,610 --> 01:32:43,940
It just.

775
01:32:44,740 --> 01:32:52,520
Takes everything you can think you're affiliated with, but because the names are listed at that group, it pops up as like, Oh, did you offer this?

776
01:32:52,520 --> 01:32:58,810
And I'm like, Well, not really, but like my name is still in the ether affiliated with that do member of the paper.

777
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:07,809
So it's a little bit of a gray area, but it's nice to show like you contributed, but you're not an author, so I never know what to do.

778
01:33:07,810 --> 01:33:14,110
I got some recipes so I like. I'd list the name of the thing and I say, like, as part of this group.

779
01:33:15,530 --> 01:33:18,650
But I think I actually spoke them out in a separate area of the CV.

780
01:33:19,130 --> 01:33:24,410
So this whole sort of like bigger groups that work together.

781
01:33:25,130 --> 01:33:31,460
I think also if depending on like the disciplinary practice, that would kind of drive some of the conversation to, I think.

782
01:33:35,150 --> 01:33:40,650
Let's see, I think here. This is sort of some of the stuff I've been talking through.

783
01:33:40,650 --> 01:33:49,020
So like data analysis, coding, data collection, conducting an intervention like as the interventionist, if you like, a key part of the study.

784
01:33:49,020 --> 01:33:55,470
But is it authorship like? Not necessarily. Like I would say all of these things are not necessarily authorship.

785
01:33:56,250 --> 01:33:59,730
And yeah, a case would need to be made for that.

786
01:34:00,300 --> 01:34:03,420
But I think that's hard because that's what people spend a lot of time doing.

787
01:34:03,420 --> 01:34:07,139
Who are students, who for whom authorship is a good goal.

788
01:34:07,140 --> 01:34:16,740
So I think, you know, yeah, I think these sort of student considerations, these very specific ones come up.

789
01:34:16,740 --> 01:34:23,790
But then this general stuff too, like if you find you're spending all of your time doing these things and not writing,

790
01:34:24,240 --> 01:34:28,590
that's a good time to like recalibrate and be like, okay,

791
01:34:28,650 --> 01:34:35,070
let me connect some writing to these activities in this project or seek out writing

792
01:34:35,070 --> 01:34:38,790
opportunities in a different project and not because these are all great things to do.

793
01:34:38,820 --> 01:34:41,100
They build are like mode one science, right?

794
01:34:41,610 --> 01:34:47,280
But if that is what you're doing with your time as a Ph.D. student, which is a lot of what PSC students are doing,

795
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:52,260
their time without authorship connections, and that can be problematic for you.

796
01:34:52,350 --> 01:35:00,299
So just keeping that on your radar and I think these are the other like key issues that come up all the time with students.

797
01:35:00,300 --> 01:35:05,250
So should API always be included and all studies that use those data,

798
01:35:05,940 --> 01:35:14,069
I feel like generally that convention seems to be yes, especially it's a very identifiable project.

799
01:35:14,070 --> 01:35:17,490
Like if it's a big, like I said, like a 30 year longitudinal study,

800
01:35:19,110 --> 01:35:23,400
that's harder because there's so many different people and peers who've been involved.

801
01:35:25,050 --> 01:35:28,560
So things like Fragile Families study, that is public data.

802
01:35:28,630 --> 01:35:32,070
Like you don't tend to include those original pieces on your paper,

803
01:35:32,580 --> 01:35:39,389
but you could like reach out to an original pi to ask questions about whatever some part of it or get their take,

804
01:35:39,390 --> 01:35:42,840
and then maybe they could be included. So that's, that's another bit of it.

805
01:35:43,230 --> 01:35:48,990
It's like a different space. But those publicly available data sets had PIs attached to them.

806
01:35:48,990 --> 01:35:52,530
But we don't include pieces in our write ups of those data.

807
01:35:52,530 --> 01:36:01,950
So that's another thing to kind of keep in mind. This is another thing that comes up a lot and this comes up around cognates because sometimes

808
01:36:01,950 --> 01:36:08,009
a cognate member of like a dissertation committee could be in that kind of functional role.

809
01:36:08,010 --> 01:36:14,610
Like, I'm here to serve this very specific part of the task and I'm not really involved with the rest of the dissertation.

810
01:36:15,690 --> 01:36:19,740
In that case, maybe that person doesn't need to be on the other dissertation papers,

811
01:36:20,430 --> 01:36:29,190
but if it's somebody who's like contributed all along to dissertation like forming and proposal and they need some suggestions and,

812
01:36:29,940 --> 01:36:35,399
you know, help to shape the direction of it, like added variables that should be considered.

813
01:36:35,400 --> 01:36:39,780
Like those are more kind of key contributions that dissertation committee members would make.

814
01:36:39,780 --> 01:36:47,580
And I would say like I would as a student, I would hear on the side of like certainly offering and maybe assuming authorship,

815
01:36:47,730 --> 01:36:53,250
but it doesn't always need to be the case. So that's again like just keeping in mind for future.

816
01:36:54,420 --> 01:37:02,790
And then this one, this, this is where that sort of comes up around if you decide to do a project with the fellow students,

817
01:37:03,480 --> 01:37:10,469
which I think is great, sort of thinking through like, okay, is there a way we could maybe make this to papers is one idea.

818
01:37:10,470 --> 01:37:17,190
And like we flip, you know, we, we both would work really hard on both papers and one of us is first on one and one of us is first on the other.

819
01:37:17,700 --> 01:37:21,720
And I think that's probably the most optimal way for that to happen.

820
01:37:23,130 --> 01:37:30,150
If it ends up being one paper, then maybe you do that shared first authorship piece or you decide, you know what?

821
01:37:30,150 --> 01:37:33,719
Why don't you just delete it? I'm going to step back and I'll be second and maybe first.

822
01:37:33,720 --> 01:37:40,200
So sometimes it's easier to negotiate that with peers and sometimes not because,

823
01:37:40,680 --> 01:37:49,649
you know, students need papers more than peers do, usually depending strategically.

824
01:37:49,650 --> 01:37:55,170
When you say offering authorship, does that mean that they would then like review something?

825
01:37:55,500 --> 01:38:00,690
Yeah, yeah. So they've definitely been in in, you know, in a typical dissertation committee,

826
01:38:00,690 --> 01:38:04,649
if it's like a multiple manuscript format, which usually they all are at this point.

827
01:38:04,650 --> 01:38:12,450
So you have like three papers, you're going to publish your dissertation, the whole committee at a minimum.

828
01:38:14,660 --> 01:38:17,460
And I see this and I don't know how she does it.

829
01:38:17,480 --> 01:38:27,620
I guess my dissertation could easily be achieved, but at a minimum in most dissertation committees I have been on,

830
01:38:27,620 --> 01:38:34,040
the whole committee meets to review before the prospectus.

831
01:38:34,040 --> 01:38:38,899
Like there's a sort of a meeting saying these are the directions I'm thinking of going and my data sets.

832
01:38:38,900 --> 01:38:45,770
And then there's like a big wide open discussion and then there's a prospectus meeting that's like, here are the three studies here.

833
01:38:45,770 --> 01:38:51,499
My adolescent analysis plans here is like a much more tight to plan, and that's the whole committee.

834
01:38:51,500 --> 01:38:57,770
And there's definitely conversation at that point that would be shaping a lot of this dissertation.

835
01:38:58,610 --> 01:39:06,290
And then there's then you could go from prospectus to defense of the dissertation, never interacting with that person again.

836
01:39:07,790 --> 01:39:15,680
But because this whole prospectus meeting happened and there was input and discussion and shaping then at the defense.

837
01:39:17,670 --> 01:39:23,909
There'd be sort of completed work and any papers that have not been published in between the prospectus and the defense,

838
01:39:23,910 --> 01:39:27,840
which often there are some papers published in between the prospectus and the defense.

839
01:39:29,880 --> 01:39:38,830
That would be a place where you. The same people would participate in authorship or off their authorship, authorship, Sun says.

840
01:39:39,400 --> 01:39:47,250
So, like, there's definitely some dissertations that I've been on that the students between the perspectives

841
01:39:47,260 --> 01:39:52,510
of a defense has like published two manuscripts already that are like their dissertation chapters,

842
01:39:52,510 --> 01:40:00,550
basically. And I would say in general, we've the whole dissertation committee has been on those papers just because we were involved in the planning.

843
01:40:03,580 --> 01:40:04,510
But it does vary.

844
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:13,870
Like here in public health, there's often a data meeting and I'm not sure if HP actually requires a data meeting for the dissertation,

845
01:40:14,620 --> 01:40:19,480
but that's kind of where you're saying, here's my results, here's how I plan to interpret them.

846
01:40:20,470 --> 01:40:24,190
What do you guys think like before the defense?

847
01:40:26,250 --> 01:40:31,350
And that happens like in nutrition requires a data meeting that requires a data meeting.

848
01:40:31,650 --> 01:40:36,200
I'm not sure about HPC. So yeah,

849
01:40:36,200 --> 01:40:42,079
there's definitely a lot of these like oh pieces this I just pulled this up because

850
01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:46,430
there is a this is a Twitter discussion about like reasons to bow out of a paper.

851
01:40:47,690 --> 01:40:54,200
And I think it's written by like a data analyst. Person who was saying, like,

852
01:40:54,200 --> 01:41:03,440
I've done a lot of analysis for like clinical scientists who are not moving papers forward and I just can't be involved anymore.

853
01:41:03,450 --> 01:41:06,679
And I've moved to a different institution. I need to bow out of the paper.

854
01:41:06,680 --> 01:41:14,120
So I thought it was kind of a good discussion of that issue because bowing out of a paper is always a little painful.

855
01:41:14,120 --> 01:41:19,009
Like if you've been involved in it and you're like vested in it, but you are not the person who can move it forward.

856
01:41:19,010 --> 01:41:27,559
That is a really frustrating place to be. So just thinking about like taking on that first, first authorship of the paper, you know,

857
01:41:27,560 --> 01:41:35,260
taking it seriously and moving it forward for the team so that people don't feel like they have to bow out of your paper, isn't it?

858
01:41:36,450 --> 01:41:41,720
Um, okay, so here are sort of another.

859
01:41:42,980 --> 01:41:46,610
It's like another way to conceptualize some of those guidelines I thought was kind of interesting.

860
01:41:46,610 --> 01:41:58,290
So. Authorship and the like more inclined towards authorship as in green not inclined towards authorship as in fuchsia.

861
01:41:59,940 --> 01:42:06,450
But so here are these different types of roles that people can take in, in research, in a research project.

862
01:42:07,200 --> 01:42:10,440
And this is kind of like what I was talking about, the design interpretation.

863
01:42:10,450 --> 01:42:14,370
So that's like committee members giving deep input on dissertations.

864
01:42:14,890 --> 01:42:23,210
And like authorship would be, you know, more likely than not assume any kind of active involvement.

865
01:42:23,230 --> 01:42:33,430
I think this was this had been based on, you know, like interviews and polls with with funded researchers here, supervision of the project.

866
01:42:34,780 --> 01:42:39,730
Generally, yes. So that would be like one's adviser authorship.

867
01:42:40,180 --> 01:42:45,850
But here, just more like training, education like you take a class or you do like a methods thing.

868
01:42:47,020 --> 01:42:53,919
I would say if that person like say you take like a qualitative methods class and you

869
01:42:53,920 --> 01:42:58,300
like bond with the professor and then you use those methods in your dissertation.

870
01:42:59,290 --> 01:43:04,690
Just because that person taught you qualitative methods does not necessarily mean they are on your dissertation.

871
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:07,810
They could be a committee and then that's like goes to the whole committee process.

872
01:43:08,710 --> 01:43:15,040
If though they mentor you in like conducting the analysis after taking the class,

873
01:43:15,430 --> 01:43:20,140
that could be some authorship, even if it's like not their topic area, for example.

874
01:43:21,100 --> 01:43:25,990
So I feel like that that's a little bit of a gray area and something like discuss,

875
01:43:26,140 --> 01:43:29,950
you know, or like statistical consultation also could fall into that.

876
01:43:30,590 --> 01:43:36,010
They're like, Oh my gosh, I'd met with this person like five times about these analyzes.

877
01:43:37,240 --> 01:43:42,819
Should I offer them to be an offer on a paper? So that that's kind of in this space.

878
01:43:42,820 --> 01:43:53,740
I think here resources, if the person or PI or whatever only provides money, then that's a good acknowledgment space.

879
01:43:54,130 --> 01:44:00,100
And again, that may conflict kind of with like the pi of the study.

880
01:44:00,100 --> 01:44:05,499
But I would say if the the is totally uninvolved, it's probably not optimal anyway.

881
01:44:05,500 --> 01:44:10,780
But if they are and they just funded the study and they're doing an offshoot, maybe they are an author.

882
01:44:12,070 --> 01:44:15,250
Resources, this is like this recruitment space.

883
01:44:16,060 --> 01:44:19,600
So those could be gray areas. Data acquisition.

884
01:44:19,600 --> 01:44:23,710
So this is like a design and conducted the experiment and collected all the data

885
01:44:24,100 --> 01:44:27,700
there for an there because you're probably the person in charge of the study.

886
01:44:27,700 --> 01:44:32,400
It's like my dissertation. Yes, that's my study here.

887
01:44:32,410 --> 01:44:39,270
More like technical things. And again like this is that statistics like no, you have a question and trying to work out in your dissertation.

888
01:44:39,280 --> 01:44:44,380
It's really thorny. You took a class or Justin, he's not your advisor, but you're like, Oh, I want to get a consultation with Justin.

889
01:44:45,760 --> 01:44:49,389
Like that one time consultation, not author.

890
01:44:49,390 --> 01:44:53,050
If you end up doing all these additional analysis and, you know,

891
01:44:53,740 --> 01:44:58,980
keep meeting with him and he's becoming more involved in interpreting, you know, the results, blah, blah.

892
01:44:59,500 --> 01:45:02,200
Then I would say like, would you be an author on this paper?

893
01:45:02,260 --> 01:45:09,430
So and I had that conversation earlier on, but I think that comes up around a lot of data analysis stuff.

894
01:45:10,740 --> 01:45:16,570
Um, let's see. Drafting of manuscript reading and commenting on manuscript.

895
01:45:16,580 --> 01:45:20,379
So here I think also this is becoming a little more common,

896
01:45:20,380 --> 01:45:26,200
like just sort of saying thank you to this person for providing feedback or even like thank you to these reviewers.

897
01:45:26,350 --> 01:45:33,280
Just sort of like back to the reviewer discussion, like thank you for this reviewer for bringing up this point about it.

898
01:45:33,340 --> 01:45:36,430
And so here we have like that's a little more that previous situation,

899
01:45:36,430 --> 01:45:47,320
like honorary authorship keeps celebrities like celebrities like on paper, but like Anthony Foushee would be like a celebrity author, you know?

900
01:45:48,790 --> 01:45:56,740
So those kind of like acknowledgments spaces are really good for that, like big senior people who are not a part of your study,

901
01:45:57,370 --> 01:46:00,730
but somehow associated with your study, maybe an acknowledgment for them.

902
01:46:00,820 --> 01:46:04,480
So I thought that was another good way of sort of looking at that.

903
01:46:05,020 --> 01:46:09,330
And then this is again like we had those ideas.

904
01:46:09,460 --> 01:46:18,160
I mean, I see Jimmy guidelines, but this is another place where you're like, if you're like struggling with pulling away, don't know what to do.

905
01:46:18,170 --> 01:46:23,230
I've talked to people and people vary on what to do in a situation which happens a lot.

906
01:46:24,280 --> 01:46:30,220
There are these sort of like publication ethics. Resources.

907
01:46:31,420 --> 01:46:39,790
And, you know, we've kind of talked through some of this, but like this, again, like I was going to say,

908
01:46:39,790 --> 01:46:45,699
the Amy model of like having a pre written with roles assigned because I think sometimes you see

909
01:46:45,700 --> 01:46:52,510
a pre-written document come forward about a project when you're like the lead of that idea,

910
01:46:52,540 --> 01:46:55,390
you know, like, I'm gonna to do this idea, here are the variables I want to do.

911
01:46:55,400 --> 01:47:00,130
Here's my question, but it's not necessarily tagging people to do the work.

912
01:47:01,810 --> 01:47:09,040
So I think that's an interesting, you know, additional thing to put forward here,

913
01:47:09,040 --> 01:47:15,339
facilitating awareness of emerging standards, like putting one's organized with papers.

914
01:47:15,340 --> 01:47:21,700
It's very officially acknowledged authorship and then that sort of stuff, like unusual patterns of behavior.

915
01:47:21,700 --> 01:47:33,389
So like if somebody is. You know, either like a team never includes a large number of authors when, you know,

916
01:47:33,390 --> 01:47:36,860
it's like a big team science project, that's just something to be alerted to.

917
01:47:36,870 --> 01:47:47,040
Maybe it's that person's discipline. Maybe it's, you know, just sort of a PI who's very non inclusive of authors.

918
01:47:47,040 --> 01:47:52,290
So that that would be something to sort of think about. Okay.

919
01:47:56,800 --> 01:48:00,629
I feel like we haven't talked about some of this stuff.

920
01:48:00,630 --> 01:48:06,720
The short term researchers thing I think is a is an issue, again, with master's students who might be involved.

921
01:48:07,980 --> 01:48:14,880
Ph.D. students kind of could count as short term researchers because they go to different places and so forth,

922
01:48:15,820 --> 01:48:20,100
and so they may not be done with stuff before leaving.

923
01:48:20,100 --> 01:48:27,410
So that's something to consider also relates to data management because you need to get the data use

924
01:48:27,420 --> 01:48:34,320
agreement if you do go somewhere else before the papers are finished in or access the data again.

925
01:48:34,470 --> 01:48:41,730
So that's important. And then back to that mode to team science, community collaborators, how do we incorporate them?

926
01:48:43,020 --> 01:48:46,650
Talked a little bit about order slow papers.

927
01:48:47,070 --> 01:48:50,910
That's that thing about if your first author on paper, you really need to get it out.

928
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:54,059
I don't know if all of us have been involved with slow papers,

929
01:48:54,060 --> 01:49:01,920
but it's painful and then it brings up all these authorship issues because you're like, Oh, maybe so-and-so could be brought in to help finish this.

930
01:49:02,250 --> 01:49:08,280
And then you have like a string of people and nobody's really doing.

931
01:49:09,450 --> 01:49:13,420
And so at that point, it's just.

932
01:49:14,330 --> 01:49:18,680
It's just really hard. And that's what people do or should maybe, I don't know,

933
01:49:18,680 --> 01:49:26,780
start bailing out of papers or people are finishing up papers for others and feeling resentful and irritated,

934
01:49:27,530 --> 01:49:31,939
which is not the optimal space in which to write papers because it's already hard to write papers.

935
01:49:31,940 --> 01:49:37,460
So this is a big issue and I think.

936
01:49:39,460 --> 01:49:47,410
I'll just pull up the examples. Probably not as nice as it is, but I think we may have looked at one like this before.

937
01:49:47,410 --> 01:49:57,390
But like. This is one where we were sort of like, okay, oops.

938
01:49:59,090 --> 01:50:05,240
I think that original idea that maybe I don't know what that title is supposed to be, but it's like the general idea.

939
01:50:06,020 --> 01:50:12,910
This is the kind of question these are the data sources that we're going to use the best paper and the primary construct.

940
01:50:12,920 --> 01:50:20,810
So it's you can see it's kind of a little bit messy. Do we have a specific goal for this paper and who is the lead on the paper status?

941
01:50:21,110 --> 01:50:25,879
What target journal date to submit and then does anybody want to contribute?

942
01:50:25,880 --> 01:50:34,520
So there are various different ways one can do this, but I think it is always good, especially in team science, to have these data tracking things.

943
01:50:34,520 --> 01:50:35,899
And I think I mentioned before,

944
01:50:35,900 --> 01:50:43,850
like it's helpful to keep one single version of this from one's own papers that we're working on because then it's just your,

945
01:50:44,330 --> 01:50:54,350
your stuff and then you can be accountable to yourself and to your projects and your future projects and just sort of keep things moving along.

946
01:50:54,470 --> 01:51:00,380
So if anybody has a good paper tool that helps with that stuff.

947
01:51:00,900 --> 01:51:05,160
It's always good to share those. I also want to say this.

948
01:51:05,160 --> 01:51:13,880
We made this here a year ago, but it was like dropped papers because the results were just not compelling, which is always a little bit sad.

949
01:51:13,890 --> 01:51:20,219
But you're like, You know what? Let's document what we dropped so that we don't have in five years somebody coming along saying, Oh, look at this.

950
01:51:20,220 --> 01:51:25,050
And we can say, you know, we really tried to look at that and it was just not got a lot going on.

951
01:51:25,260 --> 01:51:29,210
So. Those were some things that we did with that.

952
01:51:31,540 --> 01:51:37,540
What else? So this was just like a big version of a working document that we have for certain paper tracking.

953
01:51:39,400 --> 01:51:42,810
Are there other systems that people have? This is again, this is even just Excel.

954
01:51:42,820 --> 01:51:46,750
I think it's oh, maybe it's Google sheets, but yeah, it's worksheets.

955
01:51:46,750 --> 01:51:53,140
But any systems that people have used that they have found helpful in this space or unhelpful?

956
01:51:56,940 --> 01:51:59,940
Oh yeah. I used to use Trello to.

957
01:52:01,670 --> 01:52:05,570
And it's that that your team uses Trello where you do personal.

958
01:52:09,290 --> 01:52:16,250
I was doing that for a while and then I fell off. Look at you more than your waistline.

959
01:52:16,670 --> 01:52:27,240
Our teams are numbered. And so here's like. You should have resources to reach out to our favorite journals as well as predatory journals.

960
01:52:28,030 --> 01:52:32,960
Reporting. Like papers that you thought about everywhere, right?

961
01:52:34,910 --> 01:52:40,040
His background. There have been outlines.

962
01:52:40,890 --> 01:52:44,570
That we're currently drafting and he submitted.

963
01:52:45,580 --> 01:52:50,800
In our in crisis. Except. But youth culture is like.

964
01:52:54,840 --> 01:53:01,290
Yeah. Is actually. Yes.

965
01:53:01,310 --> 01:53:06,820
Relief is great for some. So like here, this is my favorite.

966
01:53:08,150 --> 01:53:11,320
I like the link. And we like a checklist.

967
01:53:12,400 --> 01:53:16,060
Track over payment processes you can assign.

968
01:53:17,530 --> 01:53:25,370
Year. It is just like it is burning that. Open the way.

969
01:53:25,420 --> 01:53:28,580
The good news is that. Her son. Is that.

970
01:53:35,230 --> 01:53:38,540
You can system and then do everything in their.

971
01:53:40,830 --> 01:53:44,550
It's hard to even. Different team. David Tennant.

972
01:53:46,760 --> 01:53:49,910
Yeah. That's what it's heard. Yeah. Yeah.

973
01:53:50,210 --> 01:53:56,930
So I started to do that, and it was just like a massive chunk of.

974
01:53:57,950 --> 01:54:01,710
Master, you know.

975
01:54:02,260 --> 01:54:03,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

976
01:54:03,890 --> 01:54:14,420
So yeah that it's a really good and again like time if you do it a personal tone so you can track what you're doing across different things.

977
01:54:15,680 --> 01:54:19,460
But yeah, if you haven't and that's, that's a hard thing to do.

978
01:54:19,570 --> 01:54:24,570
Take science and you work at different. Or they used different systems about it.

979
01:54:24,570 --> 01:54:27,960
In this case, that example is just like.

980
01:54:28,810 --> 01:54:38,889
Okay. Google sheets, whatever. Yeah, it's definitely not as friendly, but you can tap people so that you can do different ways.

981
01:54:38,890 --> 01:54:42,100
But Trello is definitely much more comprehensive.

982
01:54:45,170 --> 01:54:53,690
So I think those are really helpful. And again, starting like with managing yourself, it's probably good to see if that is something you want to try.

983
01:54:55,430 --> 01:54:59,719
Interdisciplinary differences. Oh, piecemeal publication.

984
01:54:59,720 --> 01:55:02,600
I think we talked about that a little bit around like planning papers,

985
01:55:02,600 --> 01:55:12,130
sort of like what counts as a full paper to kind of move forward with and then how to acknowledge also that there's another responsible authors.

986
01:55:12,140 --> 01:55:15,080
And I love that you have a predatory journalist on that list.

987
01:55:15,080 --> 01:55:22,850
You could add you could add those like ethics of publication things to like, like journal resources, which is what I.

988
01:55:23,920 --> 01:55:29,610
It's very similar. Yeah, I've seen that one. Yeah.

989
01:55:31,350 --> 01:55:40,650
That's an injury list. It's I put it down when I was like getting over this review request that.

990
01:55:41,550 --> 01:55:44,580
Yes, ma'am. Oh, yeah. On your watch or.

991
01:55:45,090 --> 01:55:49,910
Yeah, that's an organized thing to do. Few growing list.

992
01:55:50,420 --> 01:55:54,410
There are that like think check submit is your site looking at that.

993
01:55:54,460 --> 01:55:57,920
Yeah I'm still able to go from. Yes, yes.

994
01:55:57,920 --> 01:56:02,510
I think that's a good and I feel like there are even some ones that are listed as.

995
01:56:03,730 --> 01:56:06,970
Watch out for these. But. But it can be hard to tell.

996
01:56:07,060 --> 01:56:12,160
So it is. Yeah. Like if you're in a publishing a specific space.

997
01:56:13,620 --> 01:56:18,930
That's probably a good time to pull up the list. Otherwise, I think like there's probably new ones all the time.

998
01:56:19,650 --> 01:56:22,740
So that that idea of, like, here's what to look out for.

999
01:56:23,080 --> 01:56:26,640
Mm hmm. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.

1000
01:56:28,590 --> 01:56:33,530
See an authors. Around the epidemic.

1001
01:56:33,530 --> 01:56:36,880
Twitter also very hard to determining what.

1002
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:44,870
I know. It's quite it's a good start.

1003
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:54,470
I got one every week, literally, like the day I went up the Twitter down.

1004
01:56:54,690 --> 01:56:59,510
It's a weird thing because it is. I mean, I have to say, like, it's been a good.

1005
01:56:59,750 --> 01:57:03,870
Yeah. Just place for certain things.

1006
01:57:03,870 --> 01:57:08,940
And like again in the academic space, it's been super positive in a lot of ways and.

1007
01:57:10,210 --> 01:57:16,590
I just don't know. Like, there's one. There's, like, there's been a whole big econ metoo movement.

1008
01:57:20,830 --> 01:57:30,580
You know, outing people in terms of being sexual abusers, like very, very intense sort of discussions in the economy, in the economics space.

1009
01:57:31,900 --> 01:57:37,870
And anyway, so I was following some of that and they said they're moving to like another platform.

1010
01:57:37,870 --> 01:57:40,809
And I'm like, I'm not going to follow the economists necessarily.

1011
01:57:40,810 --> 01:57:47,440
But like that's kind of often where I look at on Twitter because I feel like it can be helpful sort of people who are outside my discipline,

1012
01:57:47,440 --> 01:57:48,160
who are relevant.

1013
01:57:48,220 --> 01:57:57,910
So anyway, I'm like, that was the point of Twitter to sort of be like this big interdisciplinary cross-sector governmental journalist space.

1014
01:57:58,990 --> 01:58:03,020
So I'm kind of all about the implosion of Twitter and what it might happen.

1015
01:58:03,880 --> 01:58:13,960
So since you are. Like so many different things, I can probably talk about this for many different facets of it.

1016
01:58:14,830 --> 01:58:18,300
Yeah. For executive include airlines.

1017
01:58:18,980 --> 01:58:24,630
Two is faced by a civil. I talk about that today?

1018
01:58:24,870 --> 01:58:36,150
Yeah, I think that's. Ownership it like the great.

1019
01:58:39,840 --> 01:58:42,700
But a lot of people are kind of like that. We see.

1020
01:58:50,430 --> 01:58:57,830
And it's also like, I don't know, just thinking more broadly to like, okay, how much social media does one need in one's life?

1021
01:58:57,840 --> 01:59:05,040
And he answers probably like less. But then if it's helpful, like how to find something that's helpful.

1022
01:59:07,740 --> 01:59:14,350
Yeah, I don't know. It's the Twitter space is very. It's tricky to see what's going to happen.

1023
01:59:14,350 --> 01:59:17,499
And I, you know, I feel like, yeah,

1024
01:59:17,500 --> 01:59:25,500
personally I might like I found it really useful for sort of following interests and again in that sort of cross-sector space too,

1025
01:59:25,590 --> 01:59:30,729
I look at people who do government work on child care and like get information.

1026
01:59:30,730 --> 01:59:37,150
You know, I could spend time just on the Internet trolling around those things, but like if I follow those accounts, they'll feed it to me.

1027
01:59:37,780 --> 01:59:47,200
So I think that's just going to be really hard to replicate on another platform because I don't know if like,

1028
01:59:48,910 --> 01:59:55,989
yeah, child care policy researchers are going to come to like economics, Twitter, Mastodon or academic Twitter.

1029
01:59:55,990 --> 02:00:04,690
But like, that's what I, you know what I mean? It's like that's what's so kind of cool about the Twitter sphere, you know?

1030
02:00:04,690 --> 02:00:13,870
I know that, you know, there's like, okay, let me see.

1031
02:00:14,590 --> 02:00:19,060
I feel like that's a fair bit of authorship. I can just watch a little video in a minute.

1032
02:00:20,140 --> 02:00:24,969
Okay. Let me talk a little bit more about data science, data sharing, data management.

1033
02:00:24,970 --> 02:00:29,350
So because now this is the the big new thing.

1034
02:00:31,240 --> 02:00:40,120
So there's a few. And it always I feel like just so much of this does it like rears its head in team science or team science is like so.

1035
02:00:43,450 --> 02:00:50,319
So important, such an important space in which to consider data management stuff as well as other things.

1036
02:00:50,320 --> 02:01:01,960
So we've talked about authorship, but this is another piece that is, again, like more newly on the radar of regulating research regulators.

1037
02:01:02,470 --> 02:01:07,690
So and I think we did you have a story of the foreign talent person.

1038
02:01:08,050 --> 02:01:17,320
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So I think it's it's often in response to this like this foreign national top international talent recruitment program.

1039
02:01:18,340 --> 02:01:25,240
What these are are again like thinking about how it fits into team science,

1040
02:01:27,910 --> 02:01:33,250
an effort organized manager funded by a foreign government or a foreign government instrumentality

1041
02:01:33,250 --> 02:01:39,190
or entity to recruit science and technology professionals or students regardless of citizenship,

1042
02:01:39,190 --> 02:01:46,150
nationality or gender. Full time, Perfect says. And so this is sort of like where team science members might come from,

1043
02:01:46,990 --> 02:01:56,500
and the regulatory bodies who regulate our research process of lives want to know where people

1044
02:01:56,500 --> 02:02:02,890
are coming from and how their funding is operating because of speaking of their own us,

1045
02:02:04,690 --> 02:02:12,130
you know, potential bias and influence and not lack of transparency and different standards across different,

1046
02:02:13,030 --> 02:02:18,850
you know, countries and organizations within different countries in terms of how they approach research.

1047
02:02:20,430 --> 02:02:30,979
So I think that this is. A space that if we ever do international collaborations or collaborate or work in other countries,

1048
02:02:30,980 --> 02:02:34,730
like we need to be really mindful of like how do I need to document style?

1049
02:02:34,730 --> 02:02:41,900
What do I need to share? What do I need to share? Like, just for example, on a little small project,

1050
02:02:41,900 --> 02:02:52,160
I'm on a consultant in a project in Canada and I spend hours working with the office of like to update the bio sketches and other support

1051
02:02:52,160 --> 02:02:58,190
things for grant proposals because they wanted to know all of these details about this project that I didn't know because I'm like,

1052
02:02:58,190 --> 02:03:04,459
I'm a consultant about the content. I don't know, like they're funding. So it's just like a lot of looking up that kind of stuff.

1053
02:03:04,460 --> 02:03:08,960
And that's like a small involvement with a project in Canada, you know,

1054
02:03:08,960 --> 02:03:19,610
it's not like China or anywhere that is sort of more the focal point of news stories around the falsification and misconduct and all of these things.

1055
02:03:19,610 --> 02:03:22,640
So I think this is a really intense space.

1056
02:03:23,180 --> 02:03:31,480
And if you are getting into any kind of international work, I think it's, you know, really important to know about and think think through,

1057
02:03:31,490 --> 02:03:35,569
talk to people who are doing work in that space and talk to like the university to be like,

1058
02:03:35,570 --> 02:03:40,280
what do you need to know and how do I like what's adequate documentation?

1059
02:03:41,030 --> 02:03:51,979
And I think because these like regulations are sort of still kind of new, that that space changes a lot in terms of like what is needed.

1060
02:03:51,980 --> 02:04:02,870
So keep in mind, so here it's really this idea of balancing like we want to be open, have team science and have I mean global health.

1061
02:04:02,870 --> 02:04:11,329
Like we want to have that that's a good thing. But sort of balancing how that works in terms of all of these research regulations and why this is

1062
02:04:11,330 --> 02:04:17,420
important is that we know that practices vary and that IP is intellectual property and human subjects,

1063
02:04:17,420 --> 02:04:31,249
which we talked about so and so here the sponsors and the funders are concerned about, like if people are kind of relocating,

1064
02:04:31,250 --> 02:04:36,860
acquiring technology or ideas and then coming back to their home country and sharing it.

1065
02:04:37,950 --> 02:04:41,360
And part of me is like, Oh, my goodness. A lot.

1066
02:04:41,390 --> 02:04:46,070
And like, if they had great public health ideas and shared them and they got taken up, that'd be great.

1067
02:04:46,550 --> 02:04:49,910
You know, so it's like a lot of it is coming from different spaces than public health.

1068
02:04:49,940 --> 02:04:56,600
But because we, some of us have like global health presents, this is applied to us too.

1069
02:04:56,840 --> 02:04:58,550
That's kind of how I see it.

1070
02:05:00,710 --> 02:05:09,950
And there's some links here that are see our group that I mentioned earlier, the ones who do the consultations about like study start up.

1071
02:05:10,580 --> 02:05:16,970
I think especially if you're project or project you're part of has an any kind of international

1072
02:05:17,900 --> 02:05:25,100
anything reviewing data from another country you know anything related to international research.

1073
02:05:25,550 --> 02:05:31,430
I think that it would be really wise to make a preemptive appointment with them and say, like, okay,

1074
02:05:31,430 --> 02:05:37,040
here's the broad scope of the project knowing what you because like if their job is to know about the regulations,

1075
02:05:38,030 --> 02:05:43,729
you know, and your job is really to like represent what the research is doing, and then they can say,

1076
02:05:43,730 --> 02:05:49,180
okay, given what you're doing, here's the regulations, here's how you can meet our requirements.

1077
02:05:49,190 --> 02:05:54,589
So like storing your data this way or whatever it is, whatever their recommendations are.

1078
02:05:54,590 --> 02:05:57,770
So that's a very good that's a good resource.

1079
02:05:59,200 --> 02:06:06,580
And then here it's just back to that like conflict of interest disclosures like.

1080
02:06:08,540 --> 02:06:16,669
Disclosing something is not going to remove all sources of bias or harm risk, but at least it's out there and known that like,

1081
02:06:16,670 --> 02:06:26,120
Hey, this research team has an international arm and they're working in this international space and we know this.

1082
02:06:26,810 --> 02:06:30,590
And so we have a format for people to disclose.

1083
02:06:32,640 --> 02:06:37,620
So again, a lot of this is new, but there's kind of a data management piece.

1084
02:06:38,460 --> 02:06:43,100
There's a lot. You know, being set up to monitor us.

1085
02:06:43,100 --> 02:06:46,700
So and so are Sierra's resource.

1086
02:06:47,540 --> 02:06:53,060
Okay, so that's like international or foreign collaborations or industrial.

1087
02:06:53,400 --> 02:07:04,549
That's an old school, me, you know? And I just feel like the way that this is happening is basically like saying, like, you know, scholars,

1088
02:07:04,550 --> 02:07:09,410
researchers from China are going to come and take us technology and bring it back to China and China will be ahead.

1089
02:07:09,530 --> 02:07:16,999
Like, that's sort of what I feel like a lot of it comes from, um, and, you know, but then again,

1090
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:21,260
it applies to everything we do because it's emanating from these big regulatory bodies.

1091
02:07:21,260 --> 02:07:29,149
So just things. The other kind of special case, which is I think more relevant to public health,

1092
02:07:29,150 --> 02:07:42,590
is like the cross-sector piece and sort of the potential of like co-creating products that could make us money.

1093
02:07:43,160 --> 02:07:54,970
And so one example that just happened. Recently is someone here in the psych department has been working on here in Michigan,

1094
02:07:55,450 --> 02:08:03,850
has been working on a mental health focused prevention promotion program called mood lifters.

1095
02:08:04,360 --> 02:08:09,610
And to have your people actually participate in their study.

1096
02:08:09,880 --> 02:08:13,209
Nice. It's a good. Yeah. So it's a good like.

1097
02:08:13,210 --> 02:08:18,820
So basically how she pitches it is like it's like it's like Weight Watchers but for mood because

1098
02:08:18,820 --> 02:08:23,379
you get like points at pro points and then and so Scott was sort of involved in some of that

1099
02:08:23,380 --> 02:08:28,510
so that had mood lifters standard and then they've had mood lifters teams and then he was doing

1100
02:08:28,510 --> 02:08:33,160
a different valuation and they sort of adapted the program a little bit for like older adults.

1101
02:08:33,970 --> 02:08:39,280
And so it's been this interesting process to watch because it just got bought by this big company.

1102
02:08:40,360 --> 02:08:43,360
And so it's a product that is being monetized,

1103
02:08:44,020 --> 02:08:50,200
which is awesome if we think about like that translation and like there's some evidence that it's successful,

1104
02:08:50,770 --> 02:08:54,549
I would say like it hasn't been like evaluated to the umpteenth degree,

1105
02:08:54,550 --> 02:09:01,390
but it's a very like intuitive, good program, solid and it's been bought now by industry.

1106
02:09:01,390 --> 02:09:04,719
So it's like thinking through all those sort of implications.

1107
02:09:04,720 --> 02:09:06,430
Who's intellectual property?

1108
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:13,600
You know, different parts of it are who's compensated for that, you know, so that just brings up all these sorts of issues.

1109
02:09:14,590 --> 02:09:18,850
And that could certainly happen with a lot of different types of research that we do.

1110
02:09:18,850 --> 02:09:22,870
So like that monetizing piece, we can have conflicts of interest.

1111
02:09:22,870 --> 02:09:26,829
Like then do we ever conduct research on the efficacy of our program again?

1112
02:09:26,830 --> 02:09:34,719
Well, I don't know. That would be kind of a conflict because then would be hoping to find that it works even more than you were before,

1113
02:09:34,720 --> 02:09:41,230
because now you're making direct profit from it. So it like changes your relationship to your research in a way.

1114
02:09:42,490 --> 02:09:47,530
So that was that too hot field paper, intellectual property.

1115
02:09:47,530 --> 02:09:52,450
And then this idea of memorandums of understanding with, you know,

1116
02:09:53,230 --> 02:09:57,490
communities you're working with different, you know, business sectors are working with.

1117
02:09:57,490 --> 02:10:00,100
If you put in a proposal, for example,

1118
02:10:00,100 --> 02:10:10,030
they're the state tech creating products part can often be done through what's called an SBIR grant and people have heard of those.

1119
02:10:10,030 --> 02:10:15,820
So it's like a small business. Um, are small business.

1120
02:10:16,550 --> 02:10:26,210
Intellectual research or something. It's an NIH mechanism, but basically like if you have something and you want to collaborate with industry.

1121
02:10:26,690 --> 02:10:32,239
So another example is like using a method like maybe business school people have developed it,

1122
02:10:32,240 --> 02:10:36,920
or it's an app that people are using and you want to incorporate it in your research.

1123
02:10:38,470 --> 02:10:42,670
You might want to develop a memorandum of understanding between you and the company,

1124
02:10:43,630 --> 02:10:49,630
because if, for example, your research shows, hey, this app helps, you know,

1125
02:10:49,630 --> 02:10:59,770
kids get more sleep or helps families monitor media use better than that app developer company and then use that

1126
02:11:00,310 --> 02:11:04,570
part of your research to say our app is so awesome that we're going to put it in our advertising for our app,

1127
02:11:04,570 --> 02:11:10,360
but it helps kids sleep better. So you want to just make sure that, again,

1128
02:11:10,360 --> 02:11:18,819
these relationships are sort of documented as that you have preexisting agreements about like if this thing takes off,

1129
02:11:18,820 --> 02:11:20,350
like who has contributed to what.

1130
02:11:20,350 --> 02:11:31,570
So again, it's a sort of special case of team science around like that business and industry direction that we can sometimes run into like again.

1131
02:11:33,030 --> 02:11:41,339
Awesome. Like, if somebody has a product that's like different, it gets picked up and it's like, you know, taken to Big Band.

1132
02:11:41,340 --> 02:11:44,280
That's fantastic. And then we avoid that 17 year lag.

1133
02:11:45,300 --> 02:11:50,220
So like, mood lifters will get out faster, be like, I think it's going to be used at the Y or other places,

1134
02:11:51,270 --> 02:11:56,730
you know, but it's just sort of from this university side, like thinking through what the relationships are.

1135
02:11:57,780 --> 02:12:01,910
And then here are some. Resources.

1136
02:12:01,920 --> 02:12:06,210
And so I just wanted to pull up this website because.

1137
02:12:07,580 --> 02:12:16,370
Tech Transfer Office, in my opinion, doesn't sound very sexy or exciting, but that's kind of what they do is they say like,

1138
02:12:16,370 --> 02:12:21,920
Oh, hey, we might have intellectual property coming from our university researchers that could be monetized.

1139
02:12:22,970 --> 02:12:27,250
We want to make sure the researchers like know what that's about, how to manage it.

1140
02:12:27,260 --> 02:12:31,220
Would they become millionaires? Would they not? You know, like how does that all work?

1141
02:12:31,340 --> 02:12:33,530
Right. That's like a complicated legal space.

1142
02:12:34,910 --> 02:12:41,870
And so they've existed for a long time, but now they have sort of rebranded themselves and now they are called Innovation Partnerships,

1143
02:12:42,500 --> 02:12:52,370
which sounds really different and much more exciting fun. But it also kind of, per this article, I think, could give one a little bit of pause to say,

1144
02:12:52,370 --> 02:12:57,290
like, is everything really monotype like ready to be monetized?

1145
02:12:57,920 --> 02:13:03,170
So I think it's just sort of an interesting switch in terms of like tech transfer office.

1146
02:13:03,170 --> 02:13:07,610
Like we want to just make sure we're transferring this tech in a way that's,

1147
02:13:07,610 --> 02:13:11,290
you know, appropriate to like we want to sort of push innovation partnerships.

1148
02:13:11,300 --> 02:13:17,300
So let me just show you as this website. And again, this is not to say this stuff is like bad.

1149
02:13:17,300 --> 02:13:19,610
This is kind of what we should be hoping for.

1150
02:13:19,610 --> 02:13:26,839
But I, I, I, I propose it with a little bit of caution because like, we could put the cart before the horse and say,

1151
02:13:26,840 --> 02:13:30,710
like, oh, this is amazing, but maybe it hasn't been all the way tested or whatever.

1152
02:13:33,390 --> 02:13:39,910
So this is the website here and this is the U of M like basically, you know,

1153
02:13:39,930 --> 02:13:44,670
in the space of like social entrepreneurship, maybe there's some product that we want to create.

1154
02:13:46,050 --> 02:13:49,650
I think it's just interesting because it's talking about like, you know, submitting your innovation.

1155
02:13:49,650 --> 02:13:56,280
And again, obviously, a lot of this is around like physicists who may have figured out some fancy new way to, like, make something happen.

1156
02:13:57,390 --> 02:14:08,070
But I think, you know, as we think about our work, certainly intervention manuals fall into this space or like proprietary data,

1157
02:14:08,550 --> 02:14:11,910
you know, analysis programs and that kind of thing.

1158
02:14:12,900 --> 02:14:22,120
So this whole website is sort of existing to. Connect university researchers and really here it's with more industry.

1159
02:14:22,330 --> 02:14:30,250
And so there's all sorts of different, you know, if you get into the space and lots of different things that can be.

1160
02:14:32,660 --> 02:14:36,500
All of a sudden on your plate. So I proceeded to say, like, be aware.

1161
02:14:38,720 --> 02:14:47,430
Let's see. One of the things. What was I looking for here?

1162
02:14:47,450 --> 02:14:51,660
So maybe it was like. Oh, yeah.

1163
02:14:51,680 --> 02:14:55,219
Here I was going to. So there is funding for this kind of stuff.

1164
02:14:55,220 --> 02:14:58,790
So again, if one is in this space, which again,

1165
02:14:58,790 --> 02:15:04,430
like definitely could happen and like if you created some program with the med student

1166
02:15:04,520 --> 02:15:11,330
education or something like that could be monetized and sold to med medical educators.

1167
02:15:11,540 --> 02:15:20,510
Right. So there's there are these funding sources that one could kind of go to in that space.

1168
02:15:20,600 --> 02:15:25,600
Yeah. So in the case. This company refers.

1169
02:15:27,120 --> 02:15:35,730
Employees at the university, says the university. So that's kind of why this office exists to pass out.

1170
02:15:36,840 --> 02:15:46,830
How much universities sort of owns of investigators product or idea compared to the individual person.

1171
02:15:47,190 --> 02:15:54,270
And so I think that talking with these guys early on in the process is important because.

1172
02:15:57,640 --> 02:16:02,280
There is. A fair bit of intellectual property that this.

1173
02:16:04,050 --> 02:16:11,940
Like if you don't sort of create that sort of company, for example. It's mostly the university's intellectual property.

1174
02:16:14,620 --> 02:16:21,670
You know, like in this movie, for example, the developer created a company and is doing some stuff with lifters.

1175
02:16:22,420 --> 02:16:31,660
But then also, you know, because you're a single person, it's hard to split your company activities if you're like the head of a company and you're.

1176
02:16:33,130 --> 02:16:37,180
You know, very closely connected expertise in there, like I've done in the space.

1177
02:16:38,030 --> 02:16:48,350
And so like the SBIR grants that I was just talking about, those can be submitted by a company or by university working with a company.

1178
02:16:50,030 --> 02:16:53,420
And so. Space.

1179
02:16:54,120 --> 02:17:03,089
And I think she I think she wisely this person had to move upstairs, created the company and sort of said and everything,

1180
02:17:03,090 --> 02:17:07,440
you know, all this monetizable stuff is going to be conducted under the company.

1181
02:17:09,340 --> 02:17:16,799
You know that. But then she still wears her like, you know, it's like Professor Hat and has students who want to work on this company.

1182
02:17:16,800 --> 02:17:25,190
So it like it gets very messy quickly. And so that's why those memorandums of understanding like could you have and you could but you have to

1183
02:17:25,200 --> 02:17:32,430
to sort of spell out all the details you can have like a students from the lab working for the company,

1184
02:17:32,580 --> 02:17:37,080
like the extractor in our department is another person who's had this kind of situations like he

1185
02:17:37,080 --> 02:17:42,960
has had multiple companies and students can go to internships in those companies and he's like,

1186
02:17:43,410 --> 02:17:47,430
got the company side. But then he also retained some professorship role.

1187
02:17:48,540 --> 02:17:56,790
And so as the CEO of the company, get the royalties from the company, but you have to set that up.

1188
02:17:57,180 --> 02:18:00,540
Otherwise kind of it goes just as intellectual property to diversity.

1189
02:18:00,540 --> 02:18:07,589
So it's like that early in the idea phase of could this become a product, could this be monetized?

1190
02:18:07,590 --> 02:18:12,970
That's when two of these guys. So yeah.

1191
02:18:12,980 --> 02:18:18,320
And it's and it's tricky because I think like that's like most prefer, you know,

1192
02:18:18,320 --> 02:18:25,880
public health professors or professors in general don't have MBA training like they don't know how this works, you know?

1193
02:18:26,420 --> 02:18:33,319
So it's sort of it's always an interesting space, I think, when this happens and also feeling like, you know,

1194
02:18:33,320 --> 02:18:39,890
if you make a company, then you're like really on the hook for your product being also not harmful.

1195
02:18:39,950 --> 02:18:45,589
Right. Like if you have you fully test, you know, do you feel confident in, you know, depending on the nature of the product?

1196
02:18:45,590 --> 02:18:49,190
So I think that that's another thing that I think through.

1197
02:18:52,050 --> 02:18:59,640
So yeah, it's very interesting this whole space. But again and it relates to team science, which is also I tucked it in this session.

1198
02:19:01,470 --> 02:19:03,870
Okay, so let's. See.

1199
02:19:05,490 --> 02:19:11,730
I'll talk a little bit about data management stuff and then we can just sort of look at that website because this is this other piece.

1200
02:19:13,380 --> 02:19:24,110
That is. Around like again, super related to team science because you have any team who's like using the same data often.

1201
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:33,950
But this whole data diving like reading is just about like understanding how we represent data

1202
02:19:33,950 --> 02:19:38,839
and like the quality of data and the quality of data analysis and the rigor of our data.

1203
02:19:38,840 --> 02:19:42,120
So like all the things that we've talked about a lot, um.

1204
02:19:45,060 --> 02:19:55,410
In understanding, like where our data comes from. So I think where a results reported, are they in a good journal?

1205
02:19:56,040 --> 02:20:03,689
What kind of review? Like what? Thinking back to Kate Saylor, like what level of review led to the conclusions here?

1206
02:20:03,690 --> 02:20:10,829
Was it a systematic review or was it like a scoping review and sort of understanding all of those pieces around data?

1207
02:20:10,830 --> 02:20:18,540
So this is sort of like being a good critical scientist around data presentation and making sure your own data like lives up to this.

1208
02:20:18,540 --> 02:20:27,599
So always knowing who funded the study, thinking about like that, Coca-Cola articles of funding like,

1209
02:20:27,600 --> 02:20:31,710
hey, you know, soft drinks are really protective against obesity and like, really?

1210
02:20:33,390 --> 02:20:37,250
So who's sort of funding it? Who are the control groups?

1211
02:20:37,260 --> 02:20:43,319
If you're looking at, you know, evaluating any given study, especially studies that are sure like big impact,

1212
02:20:43,320 --> 02:20:49,350
big intervention studies, what is published versus unpublished.

1213
02:20:49,350 --> 02:20:54,239
So like were there a bunch of studies that were done that didn't have an impact and then,

1214
02:20:54,240 --> 02:20:57,790
oh wow, that green jellybeans single study did have an impact.

1215
02:20:58,290 --> 02:21:02,040
So like understanding that full scope is important.

1216
02:21:02,580 --> 02:21:09,600
And then we've talked a lot about transparency and this growing movement to like preregister, certainly clinical trials.

1217
02:21:09,600 --> 02:21:14,730
And we talked about all those different like guidelines for registration.

1218
02:21:15,560 --> 02:21:21,300
Um, but even like in sort of single study, it could be preregistered or a review.

1219
02:21:22,560 --> 02:21:27,930
So just to sort of, that's like a big summary of like a lot of different data things we've talked about.

1220
02:21:30,690 --> 02:21:34,829
And I think we looked at this cherry picking video here.

1221
02:21:34,830 --> 02:21:38,040
But let me let's just watch the quick sorry, back to authorship for one second.

1222
02:21:38,340 --> 02:21:42,540
These are these little videos of that single grad student.

1223
02:21:42,540 --> 02:21:52,830
And so I think we watched the one that was the cherry picking when he like deleted some files but.

1224
02:21:54,410 --> 02:21:59,440
The mother ship. When? I think it's this one.

1225
02:21:59,890 --> 02:22:05,470
Let's watch this spin in and watch this one again.

1226
02:22:12,660 --> 02:22:17,650
So I spoke with my old P.I., Sean, last week about the manuscript.

1227
02:22:18,300 --> 02:22:24,540
What are you saying? Well, who's impressed with our findings and is excited about the implications?

1228
02:22:25,230 --> 02:22:28,490
But. But he wants to be listed as an author.

1229
02:22:30,470 --> 02:22:35,540
I could be tricky. I know he feels that our research is an offshoot of his work.

1230
02:22:37,020 --> 02:22:44,190
Is it? Well, the work we did inspired this research, but I've long since moved past the ideas we initially discussed,

1231
02:22:45,060 --> 02:22:54,330
and I'll just pause there to say that does happen all the time, and especially when people move institutions and change their role.

1232
02:22:54,600 --> 02:22:57,390
So they've become an assistant professor and they used to be a person.

1233
02:22:57,510 --> 02:23:04,680
I'm like, Where do you sort of like stop publishing with people who have been like intellectual mentors to you?

1234
02:23:04,680 --> 02:23:14,820
So I think that's a big thing that happens a lot and could be, you know, helped by this transparency of roles.

1235
02:23:16,260 --> 02:23:19,500
What was your arrangement when you left this that we didn't have?

1236
02:23:20,370 --> 02:23:26,070
But we've always had a good relationship. Our one chapter was. So you agreed to be coauthors?

1237
02:23:26,760 --> 02:23:29,800
We never discussed. That's too bad.

1238
02:23:30,400 --> 02:23:36,430
So I know. I don't know what to tell them. I mean, the paper might have more clout with his name on it, but then again,

1239
02:23:36,430 --> 02:23:40,780
his name might overshadow my efforts and make it harder for me to establish a name for myself.

1240
02:23:42,400 --> 02:23:45,230
And that is another huge thing, right?

1241
02:23:45,250 --> 02:23:52,299
So like that is true for everything from like brand proposals, like how do you pull in senior people and have them on your grant proposal?

1242
02:23:52,300 --> 02:24:01,690
But then if they're not in a mentoring like in a mentoring role, very different in this role, I think that is something that comes up a lot.

1243
02:24:01,720 --> 02:24:07,070
So like, how do the junior people like rise to the top appropriately?

1244
02:24:07,090 --> 02:24:10,930
And part of that is like authorship, placement and detailing the work.

1245
02:24:11,710 --> 02:24:17,140
But they have to say, who came up with the original idea for this?

1246
02:24:18,390 --> 02:24:22,950
Partly Sean, but mostly me. Did you work on this project together?

1247
02:24:23,310 --> 02:24:26,850
No. Did you tell him that you go in a different direction?

1248
02:24:26,970 --> 02:24:30,210
No. We never discussed future collaboration. That's the problem.

1249
02:24:30,900 --> 02:24:32,760
So that's the problem they should have.

1250
02:24:33,230 --> 02:24:39,780
You know, and again, just thinking about like as you guys have been exiting prior spaces and thinking about this space,

1251
02:24:39,780 --> 02:24:46,960
like just checking in on like has that stuff in them discussed it with their plan?

1252
02:24:46,980 --> 02:24:50,080
Is there a timeline to avoid this slow paper's.

1253
02:24:54,380 --> 02:24:58,010
Now we're in this awkward place, and I have a good feeling about Bridge.

1254
02:24:59,670 --> 02:25:04,710
It's too important to have the same thing happen to me before with a former colleague.

1255
02:25:05,460 --> 02:25:08,970
After that, we developed a personal authorship policy.

1256
02:25:09,600 --> 02:25:16,260
Smart. What was in it? It's essential to produce all the components necessary to publish a book.

1257
02:25:17,340 --> 02:25:25,410
It also helps me to gauge how much someone has contributed to the project and also whether or not contribution is enough to warrant offers.

1258
02:25:26,430 --> 02:25:31,980
Students especially love it because they always want to do what they need to do in order to be in the paper.

1259
02:25:32,280 --> 02:25:36,570
Yeah. No, it makes perfect sense. I just wish I had done that before I left Shaun's lab.

1260
02:25:37,470 --> 02:25:50,070
He probably does too. Okay, so all of that is to say, like, that sort of tool would be great to develop.

1261
02:25:50,070 --> 02:25:57,540
Like, I'm thinking again, like, as you're getting set up here, reflecting on your spaces that you're, you're in here.

1262
02:25:59,870 --> 02:26:04,010
Do those things exist? And then like B could you think about.

1263
02:26:05,240 --> 02:26:10,670
You know, ways to create them. I don't know if that is something that you guys have talked about with.

1264
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:18,710
As I know you've been working at the same team for a while. Seems like you're structuring them, but.

1265
02:26:20,970 --> 02:26:23,670
Just sort of to. Two years on.

1266
02:26:25,180 --> 02:26:33,310
If that would be something that would be possible or whether it exists, it's a good thing to check in on with your advisor and.

1267
02:26:34,580 --> 02:26:40,549
You know, they had and we were discussing this. And so we thought we'd just check, like, what's the policy in this lab?

1268
02:26:40,550 --> 02:26:47,390
And Do you want me to crackdown? Could be not bad idea.

1269
02:26:48,690 --> 02:26:52,450
Before deeply into papers the backstory.

1270
02:26:52,520 --> 02:26:56,700
So that's a lot more authorship. It's a bit of data.

1271
02:26:57,450 --> 02:27:00,810
There is a data one. But who watched the cherry picking one?

1272
02:27:01,830 --> 02:27:16,159
Any other thoughts on that? Authorship one. I think cricket will go on to date immensely, but I like those characters.

1273
02:27:16,160 --> 02:27:21,050
They're a little less cheesy than the other ones, even though I kind of like the cheesy ones.

1274
02:27:22,220 --> 02:27:29,250
Okay, so let me just click through this data management piece pieces.

1275
02:27:30,950 --> 02:27:41,089
So in terms of good data management, again, big game stuff you may be undertaking, you're starting and I know we're at the beginning of the project.

1276
02:27:41,090 --> 02:27:50,540
So like thinking, forecasting to the future, how is this, how is the data management going to work?

1277
02:27:50,540 --> 02:27:56,240
And it could be like you're stepping into a team that has a data management system and it's great and that's fantastic.

1278
02:27:57,230 --> 02:28:03,350
But it's also often true that like, there may be a data management system, but it could be kind of out of date.

1279
02:28:03,350 --> 02:28:07,790
It could be you need an upgrade, you know.

1280
02:28:07,790 --> 02:28:09,589
So how are all these things managed?

1281
02:28:09,590 --> 02:28:17,809
So just just sort of like so you guys have this info things to think about for data management systems and how they might vary

1282
02:28:17,810 --> 02:28:25,639
across research groups so that we all know about the confidence today at confidentiality and hopefully in any research project,

1283
02:28:25,640 --> 02:28:36,290
there's a system for maintaining confidentiality and I think this is so hammered in to us, but it's always good to confirm that.

1284
02:28:36,290 --> 02:28:40,099
Like, where are the confidential files?

1285
02:28:40,100 --> 02:28:41,480
Are they on a separate drive?

1286
02:28:42,320 --> 02:28:52,970
Are they in somebody's office in a locked file cabinet, sort of knowing how that works and then data sharing and access is, you know.

1287
02:28:54,270 --> 02:28:57,280
The whole other piece to that and to come to the challenge.

1288
02:28:57,280 --> 02:29:01,829
So even if you're working with a de-identified file, who has access to that?

1289
02:29:01,830 --> 02:29:04,860
Can you send it over email that?

1290
02:29:04,860 --> 02:29:09,360
Can you send it over email question? It's kind of dependent on like what's in it.

1291
02:29:09,510 --> 02:29:16,050
So if there's any hospital information in it, you can't send it over email, at least in your email.

1292
02:29:17,010 --> 02:29:23,020
So there's just sort of different levels of confidentiality of data that you're maybe working on.

1293
02:29:23,040 --> 02:29:35,820
So thinking through those issues, consistent data format is something again, like if you're coming into a lab that's got that, that's great.

1294
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:39,690
But so, so, so many don't.

1295
02:29:39,840 --> 02:29:49,250
And so it's worth looking into and talking to people about what's a good, consistent data format to use.

1296
02:29:49,260 --> 02:29:54,809
If I'm the person who's going to be like setting up a new set of data files or a new data management system,

1297
02:29:54,810 --> 02:29:57,090
like if I'm setting up a red cap database.

1298
02:29:59,010 --> 02:30:07,049
What's the best way to think about formatting the variables and is it a longitudinal study and how do you want to name the variables?

1299
02:30:07,050 --> 02:30:11,640
So there's like a lot of detail going into that decision making.

1300
02:30:12,930 --> 02:30:15,990
And the other thing.

1301
02:30:17,880 --> 02:30:21,630
You know, organization, naming, conventions, code books, metadata.

1302
02:30:21,630 --> 02:30:30,240
So I'm sure all of us, I think, have probably been involved in like setting up code books for data sets we've worked with

1303
02:30:30,960 --> 02:30:38,190
and or working with code books that are not so awesome in terms of data sets you work with.

1304
02:30:38,190 --> 02:30:45,390
So I think that all of this stuff is a little bit painful to do, especially at the beginning of a project where you're just like,

1305
02:30:45,840 --> 02:30:48,150
We've got to recruit, we've got to get started, we've got to do all this.

1306
02:30:48,690 --> 02:31:00,420
But to really carefully document all of those data things, you will just be paying it forward to your future self and those that work with you.

1307
02:31:01,290 --> 02:31:06,270
If you take a lot of time to really meticulously go through and document all that work now.

1308
02:31:09,740 --> 02:31:19,490
The other thing to highlight central storage. So to have a cloud based, probably secure server for data storage.

1309
02:31:21,260 --> 02:31:28,400
Make sure it has a backup system which if it's like they knew about cloud storage, they will have that the server to have backups.

1310
02:31:29,630 --> 02:31:35,600
I always say that's I mindset a but like don't keep anything on your personal computer that can't be lost or seen by others.

1311
02:31:37,310 --> 02:31:49,459
And the other reason for this, like a system, data format, naming conventions that are documented and code books that list like your variable names,

1312
02:31:49,460 --> 02:31:57,200
the source of your measures, the, you know, the, the details about what that variable subscale is.

1313
02:31:59,840 --> 02:32:05,239
In some of our code books, we also put like psychometric information about the variables or the subscale,

1314
02:32:05,240 --> 02:32:14,380
because the first thing that somebody might want to do is like use this variable and then it turns out they have this whole analysis and written up.

1315
02:32:14,390 --> 02:32:20,570
I want to use this variable. And then they look at the code book and it says, Oh, this variable has a coefficient of like 0.4.

1316
02:32:20,600 --> 02:32:23,700
It's totally unreliable and bad and like you shouldn't use that variable.

1317
02:32:23,780 --> 02:32:29,820
So we've done things like put in bold, like this variable has a bad alpha,

1318
02:32:29,840 --> 02:32:36,380
don't use it at like the first level at which somebody might see that variable name so they don't get overly excited and,

1319
02:32:36,620 --> 02:32:40,130
you know, keep it in the dataset just for completion, but.

1320
02:32:41,710 --> 02:32:50,500
Things like that can be averted if you really think through and think about your own experience in using like secondary data analysis,

1321
02:32:50,500 --> 02:32:58,600
Chromebooks and like how to make them better, they can always be better. And then that don't keep anything on your personal computer like.

1322
02:32:58,630 --> 02:33:05,709
So certainly don't be the only person who has the copy of whatever because god forbid anybody gets hit by a bus.

1323
02:33:05,710 --> 02:33:13,780
It's like always my example, but it's, you know, or it leaves the university or their laptop gets stolen or all of those things.

1324
02:33:14,920 --> 02:33:19,959
Um, okay. So, and then the other thing I'd just like to highlight to people, and again,

1325
02:33:19,960 --> 02:33:28,030
you guys are newly here in this PhD role, but one thing to remember is that like if you leave the university,

1326
02:33:28,030 --> 02:33:32,589
even if it's like your data that is like your blood,

1327
02:33:32,590 --> 02:33:38,220
sweat and tears to collect it and like you got the grant to pay for it and nobody else will ever look at it but you.

1328
02:33:38,650 --> 02:33:45,700
You still have to get the data use agreements in place to whatever new institution you go to in order to use those data,

1329
02:33:46,030 --> 02:33:49,629
which always seems like really bizarre at some level to me.

1330
02:33:49,630 --> 02:33:53,410
But it's good practice and it's the University of Michigan policy.

1331
02:33:54,980 --> 02:34:00,320
So that's amazing to know. Um. Okay.

1332
02:34:01,070 --> 02:34:05,440
Uh, let me just give you guys a few resources and all of this.

1333
02:34:05,450 --> 02:34:09,920
So this is a good oops.

1334
02:34:10,710 --> 02:34:14,310
Okay. Well, here's the data stewardship across the groups. I wanted to get this.

1335
02:34:15,660 --> 02:34:18,960
Let me find that website and I want to show this is a lab.

1336
02:34:20,500 --> 02:34:24,510
Book. Website.

1337
02:34:25,700 --> 02:34:35,560
Um, because, and I don't know if you are more like, uh,

1338
02:34:36,020 --> 02:34:42,080
familiar with like a Latino book from a hard science kind of background, but that's just not something that is.

1339
02:34:43,690 --> 02:34:46,870
The standard, I think, in social science.

1340
02:34:46,870 --> 02:34:59,620
I know. And so I think this is a sort of a helpful document and it's again, like one of these big are serious resources.

1341
02:34:59,620 --> 02:35:09,159
But this is, I think a really helpful one because it really goes through all of these like super nitty gritty details of like how to do

1342
02:35:09,160 --> 02:35:17,590
scientific record keeping authorship publications due to different appetite and then bigger research environment pieces.

1343
02:35:17,590 --> 02:35:27,510
But this. Um, again, like if you guys, which you might be, are placed in the situation of, hey,

1344
02:35:27,510 --> 02:35:35,790
we want to collect these data, find a questionnaire to help set up a data management system, you know.

1345
02:35:36,990 --> 02:35:39,840
Set up a data collection process and rent cap.

1346
02:35:41,070 --> 02:35:46,950
That might be something that you guys are, you know, responsible for doing at some points or participating in.

1347
02:35:46,950 --> 02:35:55,919
And so you just want to keep tabs on all the different things that, you know, you might want to keep track of and how they are documented.

1348
02:35:55,920 --> 02:35:59,910
So this is just like a big resource.

1349
02:36:02,640 --> 02:36:06,630
A lot of these different things. But record keeping, I think, is one of the good examples here.

1350
02:36:07,950 --> 02:36:12,109
And then this is. Just about research records.

1351
02:36:12,110 --> 02:36:22,439
I feel like there is another section that is just. I think, again, you can do this in different ways.

1352
02:36:22,440 --> 02:36:26,510
We usually just I think every almost everybody is kind of converted to using Redcap.

1353
02:36:26,520 --> 02:36:32,680
I don't know if that's true for most of the. Glad that you are again to date.

1354
02:36:32,710 --> 02:36:36,450
But I think this is an important piece.

1355
02:36:36,460 --> 02:36:47,040
This is what I was looking for. So like. Thinking about data management, data tracking, like keeping tabs of how this lab kind of works.

1356
02:36:47,040 --> 02:36:54,000
People sometimes talk about like institutional knowledge or like historical knowledge in labs, and a lot of that is like never written down.

1357
02:36:54,900 --> 02:36:59,400
And so if you can and again, like setting up processes for this to happen,

1358
02:37:01,380 --> 02:37:07,740
keeping tabs of like who collected this data, who collected this questionnaire, having a field that indicates,

1359
02:37:08,490 --> 02:37:10,410
you know, obviously the date,

1360
02:37:10,950 --> 02:37:20,190
but kind of like how to track back to the people who collected the data or did the interviews or whatever it is I think is always helpful.

1361
02:37:22,410 --> 02:37:34,270
Okay. What else was. Here. But yeah, it's like, I know Redpath is free, so I think that would have been.

1362
02:37:35,770 --> 02:37:40,180
But he's have to have like the funding.

1363
02:37:41,140 --> 02:37:51,210
I think what we're kind of bringing to the table, we might call to deliver the story over the phone,

1364
02:37:51,230 --> 02:37:55,360
but use Qualtrics to this answer for the AU to then put it.

1365
02:37:55,780 --> 02:37:59,980
Mm hmm. Um, but I think there's lots fancier systems.

1366
02:38:00,500 --> 02:38:05,650
Yeah. Yeah. The subject, I think, is usually some person get the weekend filtered out.

1367
02:38:05,830 --> 02:38:11,980
So it's like the data collection mechanism, unless the data management mechanism system.

1368
02:38:12,070 --> 02:38:15,910
Yeah. But yeah. And there's so many different I think that's the thing.

1369
02:38:15,910 --> 02:38:21,790
There's all these different softwares and different things that interface and I think Redcap in general,

1370
02:38:22,150 --> 02:38:30,100
I mean in my, I don't know, in my certainly as a post-doc, certainly in my first few years as a professor,

1371
02:38:30,580 --> 02:38:33,879
um, I just didn't, I mean, that was like,

1372
02:38:33,880 --> 02:38:37,300
my thing is I did all the data management just made sure everything was like

1373
02:38:37,300 --> 02:38:40,240
really beautiful and all these variables were documented and it was a code book.

1374
02:38:41,200 --> 02:38:45,280
And then, um, now it's like transition responsibility to her was inside know.

1375
02:38:46,960 --> 02:38:52,120
And it's definitely hard to keep up on all of the nuances.

1376
02:38:52,630 --> 02:39:01,410
And if you meet somebody who's like a really awesome data management manager person or like has a beautiful way of like sharing the data with you,

1377
02:39:01,430 --> 02:39:08,980
like every time you do a data request that they connect that with, here's the codebook, here's everything you need to know in order to use these data.

1378
02:39:09,550 --> 02:39:14,770
Then I would like talk to that person to be like, can you like help me in setting it up?

1379
02:39:14,800 --> 02:39:18,640
Yeah, because I think it's a really, you know,

1380
02:39:18,640 --> 02:39:26,290
a set of a lot of learned and sophisticated skills and especially getting her different software partners to talk to each other.

1381
02:39:26,290 --> 02:39:29,830
And there's so much deep knowledge here at the university and in the school.

1382
02:39:30,970 --> 02:39:40,270
Um, if you guys have questions in addition to that, like, oh, RCR study setup piece, but you know, depending and everybody's got a different setup,

1383
02:39:40,270 --> 02:39:48,219
but if there's like a lab manager on your team that is like managing a project that you're on, that person hopefully is a really good resource.

1384
02:39:48,220 --> 02:39:57,010
But if there's not, you sort of are that person, there is the project managers meeting at that HPT That happens.

1385
02:39:57,010 --> 02:40:01,600
That could also be like they're sort of some very seasoned project managers who could

1386
02:40:01,600 --> 02:40:05,590
be good resources for just sort of again like also how things work here in Michigan.

1387
02:40:06,400 --> 02:40:13,030
Um, so I just throw that out as a resource too for you guys to get like everybody's got a

1388
02:40:13,030 --> 02:40:18,459
different like level of involvement and responsibility for the kind of data management stuff.

1389
02:40:18,460 --> 02:40:28,690
So some of this is like in your future data management lives, but some of it could be really relevant for the next few years.

1390
02:40:28,810 --> 02:40:35,260
And so there's a lot of different resources and just kind of that's one of those things you appreciate more

1391
02:40:35,260 --> 02:40:41,290
and more as you go further and work with different teams who vary in their data management practices.

1392
02:40:42,350 --> 02:40:46,010
Probably I'll have that experience already purchased it to highlight.

1393
02:40:48,940 --> 02:40:54,639
Okay. And so the last thing I just wanted to make sure I talked about with you guys is

1394
02:40:54,640 --> 02:41:00,880
that new UVM Research Data Stewardship Initiative that is just sort of starting.

1395
02:41:01,300 --> 02:41:04,480
And so here actually, you know, I'll go back into the.

1396
02:41:06,490 --> 02:41:10,340
Pull it up. Because there.

1397
02:41:12,710 --> 02:41:19,520
They're new. And they're really they develop this kind of in response to this new age requirement.

1398
02:41:21,590 --> 02:41:24,650
But this is just sort of a good space to know about.

1399
02:41:24,740 --> 02:41:29,360
And they will be, I think, really increasing their presence over the next few years.

1400
02:41:31,070 --> 02:41:38,390
And so this is like how do we respond to our new requirements about data sharing and data management?

1401
02:41:40,100 --> 02:41:47,870
But it will also help just sort of introduce like best practices of data storage and also resources that make use.

1402
02:41:48,800 --> 02:41:56,670
Its practices and. And you know, I think we've talked about before.

1403
02:41:56,690 --> 02:42:06,709
I mean, we all know like ESR it's true perception research is like the repository for umpteen billion secondary data analysis datasets.

1404
02:42:06,710 --> 02:42:13,760
And so that is just a good resource for you guys as it can go forward and you're like, What's out there?

1405
02:42:13,760 --> 02:42:14,270
And then I'm like,

1406
02:42:14,270 --> 02:42:23,480
Keanu has like combed through a lot of those datasets to look for like housing variables because it may be tucked in and hiding it like a code book.

1407
02:42:23,900 --> 02:42:26,150
And if somebody has really good data management practices,

1408
02:42:26,150 --> 02:42:32,240
they have a code book and search the word housing or house or you know, you just start, you know, and find it.

1409
02:42:32,930 --> 02:42:34,550
But that's not true. So.

1410
02:42:36,190 --> 02:42:46,830
The the that just sort of like connecting with I saw people who have these big data sets depending on like where your research interests are meeting,

1411
02:42:46,840 --> 02:42:55,480
you could be really fruitful and awesome. And I'm just thinking of that.

1412
02:42:58,230 --> 02:43:05,129
I don't know all the names of drivers like, but like talking to people and kind of maybe going through this research stewardship

1413
02:43:05,130 --> 02:43:08,970
data initiative and also have like storage because you have to put up your datasets,

1414
02:43:08,970 --> 02:43:09,810
make them available.

1415
02:43:10,710 --> 02:43:18,870
These guys, I think, will know how to help them navigate that space or just keep these research stewardship people on their radar,

1416
02:43:19,410 --> 02:43:23,060
because that could be very useful to you. The same thing is.

1417
02:43:23,750 --> 02:43:31,610
I see, I see. KSR Yeah, so I see PSR as like the kind of storage arm of a lot of those data sets.

1418
02:43:31,610 --> 02:43:35,540
So there's so many acronyms. So I see are.

1419
02:43:41,110 --> 02:43:45,850
Here's ICP Star. And so they're also ICP Star is also one that offers the classes.

1420
02:43:47,950 --> 02:43:52,990
And look at that 60 years of groovy data.

1421
02:43:54,940 --> 02:44:02,409
That is funny. So this is like just a sample, I think, of the different kinds of things they have.

1422
02:44:02,410 --> 02:44:12,820
So there's like facts the firearms data, data repository, census, plant data, child family data archive, they just.

1423
02:44:13,870 --> 02:44:17,360
I have so many different data repositories there.

1424
02:44:18,980 --> 02:44:24,260
And I think that. I say?

1425
02:44:24,260 --> 02:44:31,190
I would say like this. This many I've been in this many before and to find data.

1426
02:44:32,570 --> 02:44:37,130
So but you can see it's just a massive, massive amount of information.

1427
02:44:39,600 --> 02:44:44,270
And so you can look at the most downloaded. So there is you see that ad health data set.

1428
02:44:44,340 --> 02:44:51,570
I think many of us have probably heard of that and Heinz lifestyle study.

1429
02:44:51,580 --> 02:45:00,330
So like you can spend a lot of time like trolling around in here to find datasets that might be useful to you and you can also search.

1430
02:45:00,990 --> 02:45:07,580
Um, I think, yeah, I did do this. And there there were just like.

1431
02:45:09,250 --> 02:45:14,370
Things that. Came up and this is all it only comes up with.

1432
02:45:14,370 --> 02:45:17,429
Data management practices are in place. I guess that's the thing.

1433
02:45:17,430 --> 02:45:22,889
I would say like if these things aren't documented, it's like they didn't happen, you know?

1434
02:45:22,890 --> 02:45:29,760
And so it is a lot of information,

1435
02:45:29,760 --> 02:45:41,070
but sort of thinking about doing your part to be a good data management person is important because then the things that you do can like live on and,

1436
02:45:41,130 --> 02:45:52,710
you know, be used in future. So I would say, you know, again, thinking about each of your guys research question these topics, I'd be curious.

1437
02:45:56,270 --> 02:46:05,590
So. There's some things that could be interesting for your car, and some of these look like they're from a specific study.

1438
02:46:09,160 --> 02:46:12,550
And it just should have. Like again, this is good data documentation.

1439
02:46:14,560 --> 02:46:18,520
Yearly study of migrants randomly sampling households and communities.

1440
02:46:19,030 --> 02:46:21,000
Here's a look at the data documentation.

1441
02:46:21,010 --> 02:46:29,550
They're not available from ISIS and might then have to go on a little bit of a goose chase or night goose chase, but contact the investigators.

1442
02:46:29,590 --> 02:46:34,600
So again, things are definitely different levels of documentation,

1443
02:46:34,600 --> 02:46:40,890
but that's certainly a way to just like browse a little bit like on the couch sometimes,

1444
02:46:41,020 --> 02:46:48,700
like what's available that you could maybe do next method study, you know, am contacting this person.

1445
02:46:49,660 --> 02:46:53,210
They seem to have two projects, you know. Searching around.

1446
02:46:56,410 --> 02:47:01,320
Yeah. Do you know, they were having said that they had an agreement.

1447
02:47:04,530 --> 02:47:08,340
Where was. Yeah.

1448
02:47:08,370 --> 02:47:12,040
So I think it's.

1449
02:47:12,450 --> 02:47:20,030
What's his name? Yeah.

1450
02:47:21,600 --> 02:47:29,670
There. That's. Gosh, I'm basically.

1451
02:47:30,910 --> 02:47:41,980
The person that was really. It.

1452
02:47:43,680 --> 02:47:47,160
Farmers. No.

1453
02:47:47,190 --> 02:47:51,100
This is like the funders. Oh, color.

1454
02:47:51,310 --> 02:47:54,490
That's the that's the company that. But we loved.

1455
02:47:56,740 --> 02:48:00,550
Yeah. I thought, I thought connected. Let me just see.

1456
02:48:01,860 --> 02:48:06,780
Okay. They're not listing the people. There's a there's a guy who is.

1457
02:48:11,130 --> 02:48:17,370
He's here. Working facilities, precision medicine.

1458
02:48:19,770 --> 02:48:27,960
And forgetting the name of it is. But yeah there's a there's a so there's the all of us study in like precision medicine

1459
02:48:27,990 --> 02:48:35,150
medicine group has been really involved in that study and I'm just I can't find it.

1460
02:48:37,160 --> 02:48:45,870
And it looks like there's an element that Henry Ford there is also the this is maybe less relevant for you guys, but the ABCD study, which is a child.

1461
02:48:46,110 --> 02:48:55,290
Oh really? I think they have a michigan based investigator who was collecting who's like spearheading data collection for that study.

1462
02:48:55,300 --> 02:49:01,379
So. I think. There's always like there can be this like this.

1463
02:49:01,380 --> 02:49:09,150
All of us study is a national effort, but the people who made the national effort happen like reside at Michigan, some of them.

1464
02:49:09,150 --> 02:49:15,990
And so I think that's where you guys have an extra connection and it would be easier to get involved with that study.

1465
02:49:17,760 --> 02:49:23,190
And I'm just spacing on that. Is this specifically University of Michigan School of.

1466
02:49:25,220 --> 02:49:33,780
Yes. I was in the position that it is probably.

1467
02:49:33,780 --> 02:49:38,610
Yeah. So and it may be this John Carlo.

1468
02:49:43,560 --> 02:49:50,700
Yeah. I think it's an. But I feel like, see, this is where my in my brain I don't know.

1469
02:49:50,700 --> 02:49:55,370
But I mean, I think he's still I thought he might have left, but I don't think so.

1470
02:49:56,730 --> 02:49:59,809
Here it is. Yeah.

1471
02:49:59,810 --> 02:50:03,740
It was the precision medicine genome, Gonzalo.

1472
02:50:08,530 --> 02:50:13,840
I honestly don't know. Okay, so he's still here. So this is all of us person.

1473
02:50:15,160 --> 02:50:21,970
Gonzalo. So, I don't know. Maybe I'm just making up a rumor in my head that he left, but evidently he didn't leave.

1474
02:50:22,060 --> 02:50:25,360
So there you go. There he is. But, yeah, like, that's the thing.

1475
02:50:25,360 --> 02:50:29,019
Like here, you know, there's so many different people,

1476
02:50:29,020 --> 02:50:34,590
so it's worth a little bit of like that rabbit hole diving into your topics and be like, Where are these people?

1477
02:50:34,600 --> 02:50:39,160
Cause there's bound to be somebody who's, like, residing in Michigan in some way.

1478
02:50:41,140 --> 02:50:48,610
And I think, like, again, as this data stewardship group, really, because that's going to be their job.

1479
02:50:48,610 --> 02:50:57,960
Their job is like, let's protect, you know, you know, thoughtful and rigorous way all these data sources and help people connect with them.

1480
02:50:58,000 --> 02:51:05,200
So I think watch this space and important to just kind of keep that in mind.

1481
02:51:06,100 --> 02:51:13,749
Um, so I hope that's not overwhelming about research data management stuff,

1482
02:51:13,750 --> 02:51:19,420
but I think it's, you know, we all can like appreciate in our bones how important it is.

1483
02:51:21,460 --> 02:51:28,600
And there are again, because of regulatory requirements, there are like increasing resources available.

1484
02:51:28,600 --> 02:51:32,409
So hopefully a lot of those are there for you.

1485
02:51:32,410 --> 02:51:38,050
And then yeah, and I think now these data are not accurate, then it changes.

1486
02:51:38,060 --> 02:51:43,420
But the presentation, things are still accurate and then we'll do the peer reviews.

1487
02:51:44,330 --> 02:52:01,540
Back a week later. This is next Wednesday, the day before Thanksgiving, correct?

1488
02:52:01,780 --> 02:52:05,800
No, we did not. I think there's actually no class of Michigan.

1489
02:52:06,040 --> 02:52:09,400
Is that is that true? I don't is that true for all of your classes?

1490
02:52:09,970 --> 02:52:14,340
I think. Carol.

1491
02:52:14,350 --> 02:52:20,370
I'll just go. Yeah.

1492
02:52:20,370 --> 02:52:29,729
I think in this class it's ended up not being a class day in most years, but they also just switched like what, two days or just after the minute.

1493
02:52:29,730 --> 02:52:37,330
Switched it extra. Have them come in. Fall 2023 at the break between Thanksgiving.

1494
02:52:38,580 --> 02:52:45,960
Yeah. Yeah. There's something. Something that somebody won't meet next week.

1495
02:52:47,820 --> 02:52:54,030
And I don't think you're on a Wednesday at the office today, but yeah, it's a Wednesday.

1496
02:52:54,030 --> 02:52:59,870
Thursday. Yeah.

1497
02:52:59,890 --> 02:53:02,960
And then. So when we meet again, we'll do. We'll hear what?

1498
02:53:03,040 --> 02:53:09,330
His presentation. Papers on the papers.

1499
02:53:12,120 --> 02:53:17,470
Yeah. Look, I'm happy to. Stuff that whatever.

1500
02:53:17,920 --> 02:53:20,020
Okay. You know, you guys want to talk about.

1501
02:53:23,460 --> 02:53:33,180
I don't throw a lot of material at you guys, but I'm also very conscious that this class meets the regulatory requirements of our serious training.

1502
02:53:33,180 --> 02:53:42,660
And so I just want. Make sure we call you in person to talk about these things and resist a lot to pack in.

1503
02:53:42,690 --> 02:53:51,640
But. Yeah. It's funny because I look at that section of the times, it was sort of like, I don't know what that will look like next year.

1504
02:53:52,090 --> 02:54:02,960
It's not on Twitter. And I guess the only thing I'll say is that you yeah.

1505
02:54:03,110 --> 02:54:10,550
As you guys think about, you know, of course, valuations and talks are just sort of like the shape of things around.

1506
02:54:15,910 --> 02:54:23,070
Anything that. That for a lifetime.

1507
02:54:30,860 --> 02:54:36,880
Small. But.

1508
02:54:36,990 --> 02:54:57,770
Yeah. Are you going to be my husband?

1509
02:54:57,770 --> 02:55:01,760
But it seems like.

1510
02:55:04,710 --> 02:55:08,160
Yeah. What about you? Me?

1511
02:55:08,570 --> 02:55:13,910
My daughter's coming. Oh, yeah.

1512
02:55:18,440 --> 02:55:22,110
There's this. Do you guys know how to do that?

1513
02:55:22,490 --> 02:55:28,610
Chelsea jumped at it like he owns it.

1514
02:55:28,790 --> 02:55:34,010
It's like his beard at some sort of small neighboring town and.

1515
02:55:35,230 --> 02:55:39,530
So. He's playing football.

1516
02:55:40,650 --> 02:55:45,330
Unless people make a call like we're not going to see that.

1517
02:55:45,340 --> 02:55:48,490
We're just going to to mix it up. I read a few weeks ago.

1518
02:55:48,910 --> 02:56:00,160
Oh, did you? Oh, yeah. It took a lot of. She has expanded the baby's life in a big way.

1519
02:56:00,490 --> 02:56:03,880
Like I said, I think. Oh.

1520
02:56:03,960 --> 02:56:07,320
Give it time for.

1521
02:56:10,670 --> 02:56:19,320
It's the food you said in the Midwest and. So technically yeah we I some people in.

1522
02:56:19,770 --> 02:56:26,459
School professors at the Harvard. But.

1523
02:56:26,460 --> 02:56:29,610
Yeah, I don't know. You sure? Yeah. Yeah, it's up to the street.

1524
02:56:30,470 --> 02:56:33,820
Yeah, yeah, sort of. But I really want to do that.

1525
02:56:33,820 --> 02:56:37,680
Do you guys. This is not an accident.

1526
02:56:39,210 --> 02:56:45,770
Yes. It's fairly awesome when you only have the DNA kind of thing.

1527
02:56:45,780 --> 02:56:53,470
So I might. And they idol. I know it's going to end really soon.

1528
02:57:12,620 --> 02:57:18,070
Yeah. Getting critical everywhere.

1529
02:57:18,280 --> 02:57:22,329
But that's very well, that's done nothing. That's you know, it's pretty rainy there.

1530
02:57:22,330 --> 02:57:26,150
And I don't know, I feel like pickleball is indoor, which is.

1531
02:57:27,590 --> 02:57:35,150
It's a good indoor outdoor. There's a place where she met her husband and they.

1532
02:57:36,170 --> 02:57:41,330
She's going to be right in the hole that all these people outside.

1533
02:57:44,730 --> 02:57:48,840
Oh, that's fine. That's kind of good to have an activity for that.

1534
02:57:49,260 --> 02:57:54,810
Like for ice cream. Anything? No social activity.

1535
02:57:58,450 --> 02:58:02,730
Partizanship before you start. How? Tuesday.

1536
02:58:04,570 --> 02:58:07,950
On Tuesday. Okay. So we'll have our I think.

1537
02:58:10,480 --> 02:58:15,280
I have to say, I'm confused because our campus is.

1538
02:58:16,030 --> 02:58:20,150
We have the class. But I also don't like, so I don't know. Just 30 seconds cancel.

1539
02:58:20,290 --> 02:58:23,300
I think it's a slash. So it's like two zero girls.

1540
02:58:23,310 --> 02:58:32,219
So we'll be learning how to. Yeah, I know.

1541
02:58:32,220 --> 02:58:35,750
I gave my ten month plus. I have papers to.

1542
02:58:36,870 --> 02:58:40,240
It's like there's the time. Yeah, we'll see what happens.

1543
02:58:40,310 --> 02:58:51,960
Maybe a of travel. I used to always miss a day of that class, for example, because I looked at my schedule.

1544
02:58:52,970 --> 02:59:00,650
Extra. Why do I have that? I realize I usually find very flat out, like, not quite so.

1545
02:59:02,100 --> 02:59:05,710
Time. Yeah.

1546
02:59:08,560 --> 02:59:14,580
It's a lot. Oh, fun can be very fun.

1547
02:59:16,650 --> 02:59:20,600
So it's including my extended family.

1548
02:59:20,610 --> 02:59:25,110
Everybody so nice for like three different families have called me to ask if.

1549
02:59:25,110 --> 02:59:28,240
I guess I'll come back. Oh.

1550
02:59:28,800 --> 02:59:33,480
Oh, that's great. And now I'm going to direct.

1551
02:59:33,960 --> 02:59:39,270
Yeah, I can see that their house is going to have a pretty nice dinner.

1552
02:59:39,570 --> 02:59:44,060
Yeah, I'm going to shop around all the different outfits.

1553
02:59:45,260 --> 02:59:49,170
Yeah, and it's always nice, but Dad and.

1554
02:59:51,130 --> 02:59:54,980
Scott's dad wasn't going to come down.
