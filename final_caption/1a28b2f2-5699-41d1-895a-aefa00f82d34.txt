1
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:50,710
Because that's what it looks like at home.

2
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:59,820
Oh, yeah.

3
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:16,260
You know, I had one. I told you once right now.

4
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:29,280
Good morning, everybody. Morning. Morning. Let's continue our conversation with risk analysis.

5
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:35,700
And let me get first my phone.

6
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:52,760
Yes, it is. I mean, so anyway, to me.

7
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:10,339
Okay. Can you hear me? Well. Great. So last time we created this in this simulation,

8
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:22,520
we created 18 simulations of varying production quantities of these key junctions from 3130 8000 to 15000.

9
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:33,530
And we were looking at the mean, the standard deviation, the probability of the properties greatly being greater than than zero,

10
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:37,519
the mean the probability of making money, which means one right.

11
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,900
Which is the probability of losing more than.

12
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:52,090
What is the probability of a lost greater than a hundred thousand in each case?

13
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:58,220
So that might as well we add that to the to the computations.

14
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:05,390
So the first thing I'm going to do is generate that.

15
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:15,020
So let's go to the model here. I put the probability of getting in profit profit greater in the euro.

16
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:21,740
So let's get the probability of losing more than 100,000.

17
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:28,670
So I'm going to insert a few columns here.

18
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:38,140
Know not that many columns. And here I'm going to say probability.

19
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:55,420
Prompted. Less than or equal to -100,000.

20
00:03:55,420 --> 00:04:00,190
Right. So that the probability of losing more than 200,000.

21
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:08,780
Okay. And for that, we are going to use the target.

22
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:21,420
Remember that the target is they give you the percentile of profit less than or equal to the number that you mark here.

23
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:27,780
In this case, I'm going to mark -100,000 for simulation number one.

24
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:36,900
So I'm going to instead of one minus, which is going to be more done, I'm going to just use that reach target, which is less than right.

25
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:41,670
So this is going to be the reason target.

26
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:50,720
Open brain disease and then we have profit.

27
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:59,300
It was the name of our output.

28
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:13,010
And then after profit, we get a target, we get the the number that we're looking at.

29
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,570
And then this is going to be -200,000.

30
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:28,880
And that's for simulation number one. And then I'm going to look at this simulation number one here.

31
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:37,310
Right. And then prosperity. That's 3%.

32
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:49,100
So how about if we just get all these probabilities with a percentages of one

33
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:57,400
decimal point when they say these is going to be percentage and one decimals?

34
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,190
Now I kind of copy my percentages here.

35
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:14,350
I think that this formula and then I get the probability of because I had the run all the simulation before,

36
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:25,240
I have my probability of losing more than 100,000 from 3.3% to 43.5%.

37
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:32,650
All right. So now we extend the.

38
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:45,330
Extend the borders and then we have everything.

39
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:54,060
So let's now keep these.

40
00:06:54,140 --> 00:07:00,960
This is. This is money. So it is for my debt as a as currency.

41
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:23,240
And and. And no sense. So this is going to be concurrency and no sense.

42
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:35,390
Okay. So if you see here, if we go forward, they mean the perspective value.

43
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:48,170
We are going to get the maximum profit and in this case, 56,908.

44
00:07:49,100 --> 00:08:00,460
Right. Which corresponds to 9555.

45
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:04,850
Oh sorry. 56,893.

46
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,120
And that's 10,000, right.

47
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:25,340
So that's b that's the maximum expected profit is going to be at a production quantity of 80,070 800 that you have where it is.

48
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:30,740
Let me see. The the rest of the is what you.

49
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:36,130
She's a spreadsheet.

50
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:43,580
So we we instead of 10,000, we simulated 5030 demand.

51
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:49,860
So we put Q equal to 7800.

52
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:53,620
We put a few equal to 12,000.

53
00:08:54,310 --> 00:09:08,500
And then so we found out that in 78 with 7800, this is the mean of this time, that information.

54
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:19,910
Let me do your homework. And will thousand this year.

55
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:39,290
So the production quantity 7800 gave me a mean of 42,304 go in our office.

56
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:45,540
I can understand that in the age of 51 South they did.

57
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:54,290
The one with a production quantity of 1000 gave me a mean of 42,355.

58
00:09:55,250 --> 00:10:00,350
So a little, you know, just the with the same right.

59
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:04,460
But with much more risk. Standard deviation.

60
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:16,730
This is much more risky. So the probability of losing less than losing more than $100,000 is seven 16%, an area just 3%.

61
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:23,180
The probability of getting a profits here is 71%.

62
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:26,380
Here is 92%. Right.

63
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:34,010
But it's pretty much the same mean, but with very different risks.

64
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:47,050
And then. Okay.

65
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:52,990
And then. Yeah.

66
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:56,110
Based on the same assumptions scenarios.

67
00:10:56,110 --> 00:11:02,649
How many jackets should Eggers produce to maximize expected profit should equal to the mean demand or not?

68
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:07,690
So they. That's that's my question to you right now.

69
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:15,760
Based on what we found, what is the effect that what is the production quantity that will maximize profits right now?

70
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:23,340
Expected profit. 10,000.

71
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:27,240
10,000. Okay. So it's 10,000. You see here 10,000.

72
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:32,400
Give you the expected profit of 56,803.

73
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:38,400
And the question is, should that that is that 10,000 equal to the mean demand?

74
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:42,630
So should you produce the mean demand? What is the minimum?

75
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:54,420
Well. THOMPSON Right. So that's. Does that mean the man is 1000?

76
00:11:54,420 --> 00:12:03,630
So remember, is that the demand is normally distributed with a mean 12,000 standard deviation of 3497 that we found.

77
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:08,510
So producing the mean demand is not optimal.

78
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,650
So you you produce less than the mean demand.

79
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:23,580
And in order to maximize your expected profit and the you know, you get the probability of making a having profit at that point is 8380 4%.

80
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:30,700
And the probability of losing more than $800,000 is 8.3%.

81
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:41,700
So you have any idea because think about that for a few minutes and then we'll revisit recognition that at the end of the session today.

82
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:48,970
Why do you think they they mean the man does not produce the maximum expected profit so they

83
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:59,909
people on average you know one 1000 is Atkins but in order to maximize your expected profit,

84
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:05,670
you have to produce less than that. And it works out some as any idea.

85
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:12,930
And then you'll think about that for a while and so on.

86
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:25,440
It has to do if you want to know, if you have to do with the as this this salvage value and it has to be to do with this other value.

87
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:32,500
So think a little bit about that and and see so you comfortable with that.

88
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:41,760
And then should you be equal to the mean demand or not provide an argument that includes a

89
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:46,770
comparison of the marginal revenue with producing one more jacket versus the marginal cost?

90
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:51,660
So do you remember that from your econ classes?

91
00:13:51,660 --> 00:14:01,740
Right, that you maximized your expected profit or you might have a major profit when marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost.

92
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:07,799
Right. And remembering, Michael, and why your revenue is equal argument, of course.

93
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:14,250
And that at that point, you know, you that's what the profit maximizing would be.

94
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:27,419
So the cost of producing one more unit of one more ski jacket is equal to the extent of revenue of producing one more.

95
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:38,830
So at that point you'll stop because after that, if cost of producing one Morris jacket is higher than the revenue of getting one worth yet,

96
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:46,829
and if what you need at one point, the cost of producing one more is the jacket which is fixed.

97
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:57,120
In this case, what is the cost of producing one or more? What is the what is the marginal cost?

98
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:06,180
And is 8080 going to those $80 the cost of producing once the singular is constant?

99
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,800
So what is the cost of producing one?

100
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:15,900
What is the revenue producing one was in one defense, right?

101
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:21,630
So it can be a hundred or can be very different probably.

102
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,290
Right. So when we through can be three, it's a combination of the two.

103
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:29,730
So you need to figure it out. They spent a lot of you producing one more.

104
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:34,020
You got a different a different production quantity.

105
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:43,230
So become the 100 that you can be 30. And that depends on where you are on the, on the production line, right.

106
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:47,850
If you are so close to them in demand or less than they in demand.

107
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:51,540
So let's think about that.

108
00:15:53,540 --> 00:16:07,710
Right. So let's just create a histogram of profit at a promotional level.

109
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,990
You created histogram of profit.

110
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:20,270
When the production Q equals the median demand, what is the probability of a loss rate greater than 100,000 in each case?

111
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:32,729
So we found out that these term because we already we don't to know what is the probability of losing more than a hundred thousand.

112
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:48,330
So this is the demand, this is cuz they then proceed to the profit maximizing capacity approach one in the RBC they probably.

113
00:16:48,910 --> 00:17:00,850
The production quality at the mean time. So we know that there is there is a difference between the expected profits here and there's

114
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:09,820
a difference between the probability of losing more than 100,000 is 8.3% and this is 16.4%.

115
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:20,620
So now what I want to do is create now that I am and I'm done with this and I am going

116
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:33,879
to now show you so bring please remind you of the equations that we have in this table,

117
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:38,740
because I'm going to freeze the table. So this is 7000.

118
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:45,070
These are the quantity that is the minimum of the simulation, right?

119
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:50,980
So of simulation number one, which is a production quantity of 7800.

120
00:17:51,740 --> 00:18:00,910
And so the argument is that you see that is risk mean and that is to add risk.

121
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:10,240
And this is risk, Max, this is the risk mean, this risk of standard deviation.

122
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:22,149
And this is the probability of greater than, you know, getting positive net revenue or profits is one minus the restarting.

123
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:28,150
Remember, the target is they give you the probability of getting certain number or less.

124
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:39,129
And then we we said a zero the number what is the probability of getting that the profit is at zero or less and then one minus

125
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:53,320
that is the probability that in zero or more and that's going to be so that's that's going to be 92.4% for simulation one.

126
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:56,650
And then I'm going to simulation two, three and four and so on.

127
00:18:56,890 --> 00:19:04,390
So this is the number of the simulations we need to remember. 822 of we want to take one or two in overall simulation.

128
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:14,860
And then finally, this is the probability of losing more than $800,000.

129
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:19,300
So what is the probability of getting -100,000 or this?

130
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:28,490
And now that we have folded all these formulas, I'm going to freeze them.

131
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:45,320
You remember, you have to have here every scene table that tries all these production quantities from being 22 to 39 is enough.

132
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:53,810
And then finally, what I'm going to do now is freeze that table.

133
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:57,470
So the remote control is down arrow to the right,

134
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:09,290
and then I'm going to right click and copy and then right click and paste special spatial and just the values.

135
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:21,140
So now those numbers are not going to change. And so those numbers are not formulas anymore.

136
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:28,300
And what I what I want to do is produce two histogram for histogram.

137
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:37,580
Number one is what if I produce at the mean demand and the mean demand is 12,000.

138
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:47,810
So I'm going to see I'm going to change these number for 12 since 12,000 is the mean demand 000.

139
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:56,030
So that's I think number here. And then this is my profit.

140
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,540
And what I want to do is change.

141
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:07,510
If I go to add risk, I'm going to change the number of simulations to one because I'm just performing one simulation right now.

142
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:12,470
Now I'm simply going to simulate this.

143
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:30,310
Right. And. And that's my histogram.

144
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:41,870
If you want to export that histogram, let's see the histogram view here and the relative frequency.

145
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:49,130
That's my histogram. Right. And then let me run it.

146
00:21:55,540 --> 00:22:08,810
We need. What I want you to.

147
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:33,260
So I'm just giving you the next one next to close up.

148
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:37,740
Okay. Thanks. Okay. Thank you. In sports.

149
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:47,160
And then let's go on. Copy the ref and switch.

150
00:22:55,290 --> 00:23:00,060
That is the graph whenever I want. So this is one.

151
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:06,660
So that's that's my profit add to add the mean demand.

152
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,360
And so you can say here histogram.

153
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:31,920
Because of profit or loss when production quality screens.

154
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:36,390
It was a huge.

155
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:44,250
And now let's do the same thing.

156
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:47,280
But the production quantity is going to be.

157
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:51,330
Q Which is the maximum 10,000?

158
00:23:54,660 --> 00:24:07,280
And then let's simulate this again. Oops is not there.

159
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:10,430
Is here. Sorry. We.

160
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:28,220
Yeah. So this is going to normal.

161
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:47,230
Meaning is an extended engagement.

162
00:24:47,360 --> 00:25:14,290
This is when using kids that want to move around just to make sure to use when I use get.

163
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:22,240
Just think of the decimals.

164
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,040
And then what I want him to do is get these production quantity of things out.

165
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:55,350
And now. We're done.

166
00:25:55,370 --> 00:26:10,050
So I am going to look for the frequency this time and then I'm going to go to rise.

167
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:14,720
I think we've more put cell also.

168
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:23,760
It's just. Which.

169
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:50,210
It's. Right.

170
00:26:56,660 --> 00:27:00,230
And that's you. That's your histogram.

171
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:05,480
I didn't want these. This is that. They mean.

172
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:11,570
They mean the man. And this. That the ultimate promotion of quantity.

173
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:17,600
So provoking quantity is equal to.

174
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:34,010
In 2000. Okay.

175
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:45,510
Professionals can go back up to show where you put their round for sure, and then we show you.

176
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:57,930
So when I get a good demand, I get paid and into your number.

177
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:09,240
Right. So you give me a demand of 12,003.5 and then use that point five I need.

178
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:14,960
Exactly. I will solve this figure.

179
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:20,940
I can build things. I'll send 35 instead of 10,000, 35.2.

180
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:28,980
How did the other numbers change the revenue, cost and profit and change?

181
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:35,550
You mean how they. So like the revenue variable cost and profit.

182
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:44,580
My profit still showing us one 40,000. Your your profits will be different than mine, right?

183
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:56,680
So. You know, it's based on 5000 replications, so yours have to be different than mine is from them.

184
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,580
You production quality 10,000 or 12,000? It's 12,000.

185
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:09,540
So you put 1000 individual 12,000 here, right?

186
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:16,690
So this number could be 12,000 because of that.

187
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,890
Does that mean the man?

188
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:38,950
And if you want to show some random numbers recently, you simply put that in the Monte Carlo mode and you'll see different numbers.

189
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:49,960
But if you leave that on the static numbers, then you will be showing the date, the mean of the distribution.

190
00:29:54,760 --> 00:30:17,880
Okay. So. So the question I have to you now is have you thought a little bit about what is the you know, how to how to find the argument?

191
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:22,170
What is when is marginal revenue equal to marginal costs in this case?

192
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:31,809
Well, first, do you remember that you remember that concept from your mind, there are going to be marginal revenue.

193
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:35,130
And what the marginal cost maybe.

194
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:56,250
Okay. All right. So no problem that the idea.

195
00:30:56,250 --> 00:31:04,280
Is that all? Okay.

196
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:22,290
So suppose that your morning revenue is the margin on revenue is the amount, the extra amount of revenue that you get by producing one or more units.

197
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:29,340
Right. So let's say that Hugh is here.

198
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:37,260
Well, what I would do backwards with both of you is here, and this is your revenue.

199
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:51,410
And then when you produce. You know, sometimes the margin on revenue is is fixed, right?

200
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:56,990
Sometimes every year you produce, that's equal to the price.

201
00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:08,360
Sometimes it's involved in the price. But sometimes, you know, pay and your your margin, not revenue will go something like that.

202
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:28,100
Right. It's a more quantity. You know, think the larger than quantity you produce your margin on revenue is going down one more unit than you sale.

203
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:33,680
You might be able to sell that with for less and less money.

204
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:38,900
That means that you have discount you discount prices, for example, you know,

205
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:53,450
you quantity discount one more unit to give you a little less right now and that being your marginal cost less say if you have economies of scale,

206
00:32:53,660 --> 00:33:02,149
then your mind, you know, costs will go down. Right. But if you have sometimes you have some production costs,

207
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:11,330
but they the cost of producing one more unit is is fixed and you have a marginal cost, something like that.

208
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:21,560
And the question is that when do you stop producing?

209
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:25,220
And so you stop producing at this level.

210
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:30,530
Because here the marginal revenue is blinded, you know.

211
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:33,890
So if you use one more unit, you need some profit.

212
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:41,720
That's right. And then if you produce one more unit here at this point, then you've got this profit.

213
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:45,680
If you get one produce, one more unit here, you get this profit.

214
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:48,970
But there is a point and they are the same. Right.

215
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:54,940
And if you produce more, one more unit, more, one more unit,

216
00:33:55,310 --> 00:34:07,400
use one more unit then your marginal revenue and the amount of money that you receive for that extra quantity is lower,

217
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:11,840
smaller than your marginal cost. And if it is, then you're losing money here.

218
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:16,579
So you stop here when the marginal revenue is equal to the cost.

219
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:25,309
And, and if you have to look at your profit, your profit is going to be doing doing something like that.

220
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:31,280
It's going to be growing and then stop here at the maximum and then it's going to go back.

221
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,400
So this is the point. This is the thing.

222
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:41,030
If you want to do that, we want you to find out. And usually, right, these are new.

223
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:47,740
So we just say marginal revenue equal to marginal cost doesn't profit profit maximizing quantity, right.

224
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:57,110
Or profit maximizing price if you are looking at price elasticity.

225
00:34:57,110 --> 00:35:05,299
And so but in this case, we want these for the marginal revenue in both the marginal cost that you understand why.

226
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:10,850
Right. Okay. So what is the marginal cost in this case?

227
00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:19,780
$80. $80, right. That 60 $70 in this case is this.

228
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:31,930
And then what is the margin on revenue? In this case, it's not going to be a margin on revenue border respect that might be in a revenue perspective.

229
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:34,989
Margin on revenue because it depends on the demand.

230
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:39,700
Right. And the demand is random.

231
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:44,829
So what is expected? Marginal revenue at different quantities.

232
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:48,230
Q spent in marginal revenue. You see.

233
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:57,829
But what. So suppose, suppose that, suppose that I've tried to produce a quantity.

234
00:35:57,830 --> 00:36:05,989
Q So this paid my unit a revenue of 1000.

235
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:09,350
Q So the marginal cost at quantity.

236
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:14,330
Q is equal to 80. No matter what. So there's the marginal revenue of quantity.

237
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:24,860
Q is going to be, what, 100 times the probability of the demand being?

238
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:30,060
I hear the demand being a certain point like the band.

239
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:37,750
Very good. Very good. Very good. Very good. So so is 800, but is a hundred.

240
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:41,980
When? When your demand is what?

241
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:56,590
When your demand is less than the quantity or more than the quantity since a hundred times the probability.

242
00:36:56,830 --> 00:37:00,010
So what is a hundred times what?

243
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:07,540
The probability of demand being less than the quantity,

244
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:16,300
the probability of the demand being less than the quantity of the quantity being less than the demand.

245
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:34,180
So, okay, so if you have a quantity of 7800 thing and the demand happens to be 88,000.

246
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:39,190
So how many how many can you say you sell at a hundred?

247
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:59,390
Oh, totally. So this is going to be right in Andre times.

248
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:09,360
Improbability of it, man.

249
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:19,200
I mean, less than the appropriate quantity.

250
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:29,070
All right. You can sell the whole day, man. I want, you know, cause he's 20.

251
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:44,419
Times. What is the marginal cost?

252
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:51,780
20. To be and the salvage value now the absolute value of the.

253
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:19,570
Times when quantity is larger than demand, the probability of the demand is greater than or equal to the quantity.

254
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:35,770
So if my demands is less than he might, demand is less than to the quantity.

255
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:46,370
You should say that a man is so sorry that a man is less than to the quantity they are.

256
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:54,530
Then I don't mind my marginal revenue in setting rent if my demand is less than the quantity.

257
00:39:55,190 --> 00:40:03,340
So I want that one extra unit is going to give me three kinds of usable.

258
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:15,580
But it might demand is it may demand is greater than the quantity.

259
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:22,000
Right. So I can sell all the quantity. So one extra unit is going to give me a hundred.

260
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:28,290
That's it. So that's your mind, you know?

261
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:32,850
That's your argument for your margin on revenue, right?

262
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:38,700
So this is going to be the best data mining on revenue on a quantity.

263
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:50,070
Q is equal to 30 times the probability that a man is less than one plus, and the probability of that in a man is greater than the quantity.

264
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:56,430
Right. So. So. But we know that they.

265
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,400
Could you explain the 30 and 100. Why did you flip them?

266
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:18,500
Yeah. So. Alright. So, so suppose that we have at a point in which the man is less than or equal to the quantity.

267
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:24,230
Right. And and we want to produce one more unit.

268
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:34,280
We want to produce one more unit. So what is going to be should be the marginal revenue.

269
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:43,610
So if the demand is less than the quantity right, then I would be able to sell all the demand.

270
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:53,600
Right. Okay. So that is if I, if I I'm able to sell all the demand volume of one.

271
00:41:53,870 --> 00:42:07,700
One more unit then is. I hear the demand is less than the quantity.

272
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:19,260
Okay, one more unit of the quantity, as you put it.

273
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:27,090
So is it like the demand could be 7000 to sell 7000 jackets at $100?

274
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:35,010
But your quantity is is greater than your demands or you're quantities, 8000 to 1000 jackets that you can sell at $30.

275
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:39,300
And then if you produce one more jacket, you have 8001 jackets.

276
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:43,020
You can sell only sell that for $30. Right.

277
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:49,810
Because the demand is 7000, but we have 8001.

278
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:57,550
Yeah. So it doesn't make sense to produce another jacket because you're only to sell it at 30 bucks, but you still have to consider that.

279
00:42:57,810 --> 00:43:01,270
So here. Say you use.

280
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:24,070
The quantity is in this house and then in my mind is 85.

281
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:32,160
So that probability of the demand in 1850 500.

282
00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:45,540
Then I can. What we've made, Amanda, is that, you know, these number one more unit.

283
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:51,450
Yeah, one more unit. You know it. Give me a, you know, give me.

284
00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:55,590
They had revenue of. Right. At least.

285
00:43:56,100 --> 00:44:10,290
Exactly. If if the demand is greater than the and the production quantity, you know, still one more unit, you know, still going on.

286
00:44:10,290 --> 00:44:16,460
Give me the total revenue of the hundred. Yeah.

287
00:44:17,310 --> 00:44:37,570
Okay, so we have that theory and the probability of it in mine less than or equal to one D.

288
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:45,200
Hugh Ross.

289
00:44:46,610 --> 00:44:50,580
A hundred. Times.

290
00:44:56,300 --> 00:45:05,460
The probability of the demand grade greater than or equal to.

291
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:15,320
Q That has to be equal to A right, which is the marginal cost.

292
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:28,579
And then the three times the probability of the demand less than or equal to.

293
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:35,060
Q Last a hundred.

294
00:45:36,890 --> 00:45:47,990
And then this is one minus the probability of the less than or equal to q breaking

295
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:55,159
with the probability of the demand greater than the quantity is equal to one moment.

296
00:45:55,160 --> 00:46:00,680
The demand less than the equal quantity right is equal to 80.

297
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:07,720
Right. And then this is 30.

298
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:19,540
And probability of the man less than or equal to Q plus a hundred.

299
00:46:22,090 --> 00:46:28,640
Minus the probability of a hundred.

300
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:41,470
Probability of the demand later Q is equal to 80.

301
00:46:49,420 --> 00:47:04,499
And so we had a 100 minus three is 73 was the median that a man is than or equal to.

302
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:14,310
Q Right equals 200 -80 is 20.

303
00:47:23,450 --> 00:47:38,390
And then the probability of a man like that or implied to here is each one, 2 to 7, right?

304
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:55,980
And now. So, if so, I want you to find the cue that makes these.

305
00:47:56,470 --> 00:47:59,500
This equation. Right. What is that cue?

306
00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:11,620
That means the situation. Correct. When the demand is normally distributed with means 12,000 and a standard deviation of.

307
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:18,780
And it's something aviation. Oh 3767.

308
00:48:28,670 --> 00:48:36,950
So with mind 30.

309
00:48:39,400 --> 00:49:16,180
And then. 14,000.

310
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:32,830
It is 47. Includes.

311
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:52,150
Through the renovation and discovery of the Great Wall through through through 2029.

312
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:59,190
And we need the norm to end.

313
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:10,230
And an eternity is going to end.

314
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:19,850
The moon is 12,000. I'm just wondering here is what is the motivation?

315
00:50:21,110 --> 00:50:29,930
77 3497 3495 2797.

316
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:37,730
And then sort of do any sort of rounding.

317
00:50:40,430 --> 00:50:58,400
Right. So what I what I found here was what is the if we have a normal distribution like this,

318
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:15,470
which is I mean, 5754 So you have a mean 12,000 honest London version 3497.

319
00:51:16,850 --> 00:51:25,250
What is the you said corresponds to this area being to seven.

320
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:29,540
Right. And that's that's equal to ten cells.

321
00:51:35,510 --> 00:51:40,330
So it's simply, you know, we're demanding our revenue is equal to demand.

322
00:51:40,910 --> 00:51:45,350
The the expected minority revenue is equal to the you know.

323
00:51:45,590 --> 00:51:49,730
So they're. Yeah. Can you share your formula for the point to it again.

324
00:51:50,310 --> 00:51:53,500
Did something is one. Oh that's all you do.

325
00:51:53,520 --> 00:52:04,040
Okay. Same berries of the normal.

326
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:18,160
Let's get. And you know, that's.

327
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:30,370
You know, that that takes into account your, you know, knowledge of your micro economics and statistics probabilities.

328
00:52:30,370 --> 00:52:35,610
But, you know, this is just for illustration in the homework.

329
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:43,450
I'm not going to ask you to do something like that in the final exams, but it's something that,

330
00:52:44,050 --> 00:52:51,580
you know, with all the courses that you went through, you should be able to put together.

331
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:24,310
And they you know, the idea is why don't I make it equal to the minimum wage,

332
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:32,240
not the best quantity, equal to 12000 to 12000 is because the quantity equal to 12,000.

333
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:43,370
The probability of getting greater than 10,000 less than 10,000 is is is 50%.

334
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:50,990
So you have 50%. You know, your revenues are going to be at 850%.

335
00:53:50,990 --> 00:53:55,520
Their revenue is going to be up 30. Right? So 5050.

336
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:59,030
And that's is going to be less than what you can get.

337
00:53:59,030 --> 00:54:07,410
If you reduce your production quantity, you're going to have less opportunity to or less chances to lose money.

338
00:54:07,790 --> 00:54:18,410
So every time every time you are selling at 30, you are losing, you know, $50 because then what you want to be is 80.

339
00:54:18,890 --> 00:54:23,280
So every time you lose a 30, you are losing 50, don't you?

340
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:33,890
If you are gaining 20, when you when you say a hundred, but you are losing 50 when you sell any.

341
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:44,000
And so you want to because that that imbalance you want to reduce the probability of losing sitting at 30 and losing 50.

342
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:55,040
And then what to what point? And that's the point at which, you know, you match the margin on the marginal cost.

343
00:54:55,250 --> 00:55:04,780
Right. And at that point, you maximize your expected profit and everything else, you know, after that is going down, have.

344
00:55:14,070 --> 00:55:18,960
Okay. So. Let's go.

345
00:55:23,110 --> 00:55:30,490
Let's tackle the last homework. We finish this work and that's homework assignments.

346
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:21,890
Well, let me download it me.

347
00:56:23,210 --> 00:56:29,750
Okay. He goes in flexible savings account plan.

348
00:56:32,130 --> 00:56:39,890
A flexible savings account plan allows you to put money into an account at the beginning of the calendar year that can be used for medical expenses.

349
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:42,670
This amount is not subject to federal taxes.

350
00:56:42,950 --> 00:56:52,730
As you pay medical expenses during the year, you are reimbursed by the administrator, a paid administrator of the FSA until the money is exhausted.

351
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:57,440
From that point on, you must pay your medical expenses out of your own pocket.

352
00:56:58,670 --> 00:57:06,590
On the other hand, if you put more money on your FSA than the medical expenses incurred this money, it's our money goes to you.

353
00:57:06,950 --> 00:57:11,390
Your annual salary is $80,000 and your federal income tax is 30%.

354
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:15,980
Assume that your medical expenses are normally distributed with me.

355
00:57:16,010 --> 00:57:19,250
200. No, this is 2000.

356
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:28,820
This is a type you're not going to have. It means a medical expenses of 2000.

357
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:39,979
This is normally distributed with a mean 2008 standard deviation of 500 bill in that race model in which the output in

358
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:48,720
life and is the amount of money left after you are paying taxes for the morning and FSA paying the extra expenses.

359
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:53,960
Experiment with the amount of money put in the FSA using that racing table function.

360
00:57:54,470 --> 00:57:57,410
Remember a but is assumed that a gamma distribution.

361
00:57:57,410 --> 00:58:06,350
Let's not worry about these for now about the gamma distribution is just some give you some skewness

362
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:14,050
to your to your distribution because you know most of Europe most of the American expenses are small.

363
00:58:14,510 --> 00:58:20,989
And then there are some of you. There are large and therefore nothing is symmetrical.

364
00:58:20,990 --> 00:58:29,750
Distribution like the normal distribution might not be the right way to model medical expenses for something more than normal or its potential,

365
00:58:29,990 --> 00:58:36,020
something that had a long, a longer tail and more probability of this more number.

366
00:58:36,530 --> 00:58:42,169
But it's pretty much the same logic.

367
00:58:42,170 --> 00:58:55,120
So let's get these. So let's give the annual salary rate to 3000.

368
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:03,040
The annual salary is 80,000, the tax rate is 30%.

369
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:12,580
The mean of the medical expenses normally distributed is 2000.

370
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:20,790
Standard deviation is 500. Okay.

371
00:59:21,490 --> 00:59:25,660
And so let's start with a number here.

372
00:59:25,690 --> 00:59:33,760
Let's start. Let's say that we put 9000.

373
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:38,650
No, sorry. Let's say that we start with a thousand in deficit.

374
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:52,570
This is just a number by pointing. And we draw on all of at risk.

375
01:00:26,130 --> 01:00:33,990
Okay. You just now let me do.

376
01:00:44,330 --> 01:00:50,700
In which case you're going.

377
01:00:50,950 --> 01:00:54,490
My own nephew say this is a simulation.

378
01:00:54,500 --> 01:01:04,879
The medical expenses are going to be normally distributed with mean 2008 standard deviation of 500.

379
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:12,830
So let's say. So the so we have 2000 -1500.

380
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:21,020
This is minus three standard deviation. So it's going to get to 500 the minimum.

381
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:30,350
And then so that's fine. So I don't have to worry too much about negative medical expenses.

382
01:01:31,250 --> 01:01:34,579
So I can I can model these.

383
01:01:34,580 --> 01:01:44,880
I said race normal. And then open parenthesis.

384
01:01:45,450 --> 01:01:51,450
They mean standard deviation.

385
01:02:00,460 --> 01:02:06,760
Suppose that you you know, you were worried about having negative number here.

386
01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:13,430
One of the things I think you could do and I'm going to do that here because it's not going to affect

387
01:02:13,450 --> 01:02:22,990
in any way I'm going to you can do this is the maximum rate of the normal distribution or zero.

388
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:32,190
So if you get a negative number, then the max is going to take a zero.

389
01:02:32,190 --> 01:02:42,180
I'm going to put a zero. And so it's going to ignore all your negative note numbers coming from the probability distribution.

390
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:48,389
And you then you got to you know, these can be fractional numbers, right?

391
01:02:48,390 --> 01:02:55,220
Because we're talking about money. So it will be all that that.

392
01:02:55,650 --> 01:02:58,979
Okay, so let's let's keep going.

393
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:03,870
So this is the medical expenses are generated like this.

394
01:03:04,170 --> 01:03:07,680
And then what about the federal tax?

395
01:03:10,830 --> 01:03:20,910
So what is going to be the federal tax is going to be equal to your salary minus the amount that you put into the FSA, times your tax rate.

396
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:30,040
Okay, so great. So the idea is, you know, you have an 80,000 salary, right?

397
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:33,180
And then you put a certain amount in FSA.

398
01:03:33,210 --> 01:03:41,550
Those are not subject to federal tax. So so you need to take that out before computing your federal tax.

399
01:03:41,550 --> 01:03:55,080
Right. So this let me make sure that we signal this number here so that your federal tax is going to be the amount you

400
01:03:55,080 --> 01:04:05,910
paid for federal taxes is going to be expected to be your annual salary rate minus the amount that you put in FSA.

401
01:04:07,530 --> 01:04:14,580
And then you multiply that times and then times your tax rate.

402
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:28,620
So this person is paying 23,700 on federal tax because discounted first is it strains on an FSA.

403
01:04:29,970 --> 01:04:37,799
Now let's let's take a look at the medical expenses above the FSA limit.

404
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:49,630
So how much money do you pay that from from your pocket after taxes if you know, because of the medical expenses?

405
01:04:49,870 --> 01:05:05,969
How do we get that? Is the amount that they medical expenses minus the FSA.

406
01:05:05,970 --> 01:05:09,660
Right. Only if the quantity is positive.

407
01:05:11,460 --> 01:05:24,810
Sure. So it's going to be equal to the max of the medical expenses minus.

408
01:05:25,890 --> 01:05:35,540
Is it saying you're coughing or zero, which you just got?

409
01:05:37,140 --> 01:05:47,790
So is there. So if I subtract the medical expenses minus the FSA, that's the amount that the FSA doesn't cover if that quantity.

410
01:05:48,030 --> 01:05:53,730
So that's where I need to pay. But if the FSA covers everything and that.

411
01:05:53,820 --> 01:05:59,240
So does that mean the FSA is above my medical expenses then.

412
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:05,110
And then I have to pay out of pocket is zero.

413
01:06:05,130 --> 01:06:10,410
So the FSA covers everything. So that's it.

414
01:06:12,060 --> 01:06:21,420
So the medical expenses here were 2000, but they I put in FSA a thousand, so I'm just going to pay a thousand.

415
01:06:21,430 --> 01:06:31,049
So the money left to this person is going to be the 80,000 minus what that person pay in federal taxes,

416
01:06:31,050 --> 01:06:35,760
minus what that person would pay in the medical expenses of all defense elite.

417
01:06:38,590 --> 01:06:43,270
So one, you know, I started with 80,000.

418
01:06:47,590 --> 01:06:59,860
And then this person put some money in the FSA and that person also paid federal tax.

419
01:07:01,810 --> 01:07:11,560
Right. And finally, if that person didn't put enough money, the FSA, that person know, have medical expenses above the FSA.

420
01:07:15,940 --> 01:07:21,010
And that's what they wanted that person got. Do you have home?

421
01:07:21,390 --> 01:07:28,390
Right. So I have 80,000. Who? The money and FSA that's gone.

422
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:33,930
And then after that I pay taxes and they pay taxes.

423
01:07:33,940 --> 01:07:39,760
And then after that, if there is extra money that needs to be covered,

424
01:07:39,940 --> 01:07:48,400
that they that needs to cover medical expenses, then that's, you know, these numbers.

425
01:07:50,630 --> 01:08:03,310
Okay. So that person took $54,300 home after many of their pay for medical expenses.

426
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:17,590
So is. So I want to know, what is they how much money this person takes home on a spectator and then simply create a simulation.

427
01:08:17,620 --> 01:08:28,870
Right. So I go into at risk and then I to these these number to my money left to you is I'm going to define that as an output.

428
01:08:31,580 --> 01:08:38,870
Okay. And then we have all of that money left to you.

429
01:08:39,170 --> 01:08:43,480
That's right. Okay.

430
01:08:43,900 --> 01:08:53,140
So that's my output. And I want to create 5000 replications and.

431
01:08:54,910 --> 01:09:10,350
Stimulate. Okay.

432
01:09:12,050 --> 01:09:17,480
Very interesting distribution. So this is the money that you can take home.

433
01:09:18,890 --> 01:09:24,170
You there is a chance that you spend a lot of money on medical expenses.

434
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:36,980
The maximum you'll be taking home is going to be your 80,000 minus what you pay in FSA.

435
01:09:37,190 --> 01:09:40,190
Right. And that's that's pretty much it.

436
01:09:41,570 --> 01:09:52,240
And the way you pay for it on taxes, that's the big you know, that's the only variability here is that medical expenses are both the same.

437
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:57,170
But this is what we want to find out.

438
01:09:57,240 --> 01:10:13,070
So the idea now is let's figure out what is the max, what is the best amount of money that you need in order to put in FSA?

439
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:17,600
So let's start with 500 in increments of 500, right?

440
01:10:33,050 --> 01:10:41,380
Yeah, I'd love to. 45, 100. Day one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

441
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:51,850
I don't mean to put that here, but I am going to say simulation.

442
01:11:01,570 --> 01:11:10,120
And then in the simulation after that, the NASA.

443
01:11:13,570 --> 01:11:26,970
Rooney. I'm going to take home.

444
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:36,570
Take home. Disposable income as income, whatever.

445
01:11:36,620 --> 01:11:40,220
So that's where you want to be. And.

446
01:11:42,290 --> 01:11:45,750
Mean, is it mean they come?

447
01:11:59,390 --> 01:12:02,680
You want. You always want to know that risk. Right.

448
01:12:02,690 --> 01:12:24,130
This standard deviation of being able. And then we go DNF and say we go from 500.

449
01:12:36,390 --> 01:12:42,030
4500 we went before. One.

450
01:12:49,380 --> 01:12:52,520
And then they mean take home. Right.

451
01:12:52,530 --> 01:13:01,260
So this is equal to their risk. Mean.

452
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:10,740
I'd go into the money left to you because we didn't name that.

453
01:13:11,070 --> 01:13:20,670
So I need to put a function for the donor signs, and then the standard deviation is, Oh,

454
01:13:21,030 --> 01:13:27,839
sorry to bother me, I need to mean, but I need also the simulation rate, the simulation numbers.

455
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:31,080
So this is number here and we don't.

456
01:13:32,010 --> 01:13:43,860
And for that because we want to replicate that formula and then this is equal to the risk standard deviation.

457
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:56,610
So this is and that's going to be the money left to you and then the number of the simulation.

458
01:13:59,970 --> 01:14:04,110
Okay. So I am going to format.

459
01:14:10,830 --> 01:14:18,990
$0.02. And then a copy that.

460
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:33,510
And then I'm going to create nine simulations, right, that I don't need this anymore.

461
01:14:33,860 --> 01:14:37,110
So this here is going to be a racing table.

462
01:14:47,930 --> 01:15:03,920
But in parentheses. And then these FSA numbers right close parentheses so it knows of simulation one correspond to 500 simulation 2001.

463
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:14,930
And now I just need to go to at risk and specify nine simulations.

464
01:15:19,130 --> 01:15:25,310
So I have to go in and say, so I will.

465
01:15:28,850 --> 01:15:44,480
Simulate. It's not going to change here because I put I put the cursor on on the on the recent table.

466
01:15:44,780 --> 01:15:53,190
So this is not you're not going to see any change here because the output is the one that is doing so.

467
01:15:53,920 --> 01:16:00,080
So at least here you are seeing that this is taking the the different bodies for the racing table.

468
01:16:01,820 --> 01:16:04,820
Okay. So when we close.

469
01:16:09,930 --> 01:16:14,340
We get that sometimes we think I'm nothing if we were.

470
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:21,630
Okay. Standard deviation of think. So you think so?

471
01:16:22,890 --> 01:16:26,600
The ongoing now too long.

472
01:16:26,700 --> 01:16:30,570
Dare to say it. Gangs. The take home value.

473
01:16:34,330 --> 01:17:01,140
The sort of. And we see that is between South and then 2000 to 1500 because the 1500 is the optimal value and it is here.

474
01:17:01,650 --> 01:17:15,380
So if you put 1500 on the FSA, you will take from 50 for almost spectating 54,280 or if you save the maximum, you know.

475
01:17:16,740 --> 01:17:26,620
So if you put, you know, below the money, that means that your FSA will cover the,

476
01:17:27,370 --> 01:17:34,860
you know, with probability one and probably only for your your medical expenses.

477
01:17:35,100 --> 01:17:42,209
So they are mainly in the standard deviation of what you take home is zero because there is no nobody there no money.

478
01:17:42,210 --> 01:17:47,490
And that you are losing money, right. Because you are leaving money on deficit.

479
01:17:48,150 --> 01:17:52,950
So the more money you pay in the FSA, the less risky it is.

480
01:17:53,820 --> 01:18:05,700
But you are also taking less amount of money on on average to 1500.

481
01:18:07,170 --> 01:18:20,880
You step out your best bet for to to to take on on and maximize your expected earnings or at least possible income.

482
01:18:23,130 --> 01:18:29,550
And that's pretty much what you need to do here. This one is exactly the same.

483
01:18:29,550 --> 01:18:35,610
But instead of. Instead of putting the.

484
01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:41,330
They day that they mean.

485
01:18:41,510 --> 01:18:59,690
The standard deviation of these values as normal is extremely that they ask you to be asked to put a gamma distribution with 16 and 125 parameters.

486
01:19:00,270 --> 01:19:06,080
So so those 16 on 125 correspond to parameters of the,

487
01:19:06,500 --> 01:19:13,309
of the gamma distribution that tells you this central and the displacement of the government institution,

488
01:19:13,310 --> 01:19:19,190
which is give you an idea of the of how widespread the gamma distribution is.

489
01:19:19,190 --> 01:19:25,220
But you could do exactly the same.

490
01:19:25,670 --> 01:19:33,440
I if if you where in the medical expenses here you would raise gamma and those two parameters

491
01:19:34,040 --> 01:19:39,500
you then have to do that so because stop here is that is pretty much the same thing.

492
01:19:40,250 --> 01:19:48,559
So if you want to see how their risk gamma looks so they can say only thing that you will need to change with here.

493
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:58,600
But there is gamma. Open parenthesis.

494
01:19:58,780 --> 01:20:02,350
1601 25.

495
01:20:05,690 --> 01:20:11,580
Did you? Then you get exactly the same mean as we had before.

496
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:28,460
That is awesome. And if you want to see how it is distributed, it is simply not that great.

497
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:42,110
Pretty much like the normal distribution, but is a little bit more skewed to the right.

498
01:20:48,420 --> 01:20:55,020
So the point is you're going to get pretty much the same thing. So you don't have to do that.

499
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:13,130
It's going to be an. Yeah.

500
01:21:14,060 --> 01:21:17,810
So pretty much like a normal distribution, a little bit skewed.

501
01:21:18,260 --> 01:21:22,100
So you're going to get the same numbers. So if you want to practice, that's fine.

502
01:21:22,100 --> 01:21:25,220
But you're going to have to finish that.

503
01:21:25,910 --> 01:21:30,319
That's part of the homework because the only thing you need to do is instead of risk.

504
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:31,290
No, not with risk.

505
01:21:32,210 --> 01:21:43,820
And then the parameters are 16 one, 25 and 16, that 125 are geometric mean and, and it's a parameter for location, for displacement.

506
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:50,120
So it will give you kind of the same normal distribution that you saw before.

507
01:21:50,660 --> 01:21:55,790
But you need a mean for your chance to get higher less chance.

508
01:21:56,240 --> 01:22:03,770
More chance to get more chance to get more lower.

509
01:22:05,330 --> 01:22:08,360
You know where how many kinds of.

510
01:22:09,140 --> 01:22:20,270
But also very skewed but possibility of having once in a while you know a lot of your medical expenses and those.

511
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:26,650
Do I think we're done so we don't have to do part B?

512
01:22:26,680 --> 01:22:31,810
You don't have to do part B. Any questions?

513
01:22:34,270 --> 01:22:39,620
So I know you are you are very sad that we are. You know, Don was in class.

514
01:22:39,910 --> 01:22:44,640
I can see the tears, but don't worry, it will.

515
01:22:45,070 --> 01:22:48,950
You know, all this concept will come back to haunt you sometime.

516
01:22:48,950 --> 01:22:57,080
Some time. Well, I will bring this terror exam on Sunday.

517
01:22:57,550 --> 01:23:01,540
Right. And then you have it as before a week.

518
01:23:02,980 --> 01:23:06,970
You will, you know, post it for your grades.

519
01:23:08,490 --> 01:23:15,090
It is a big. So enjoy the holidays and go to the last semester.

520
01:23:15,100 --> 01:23:20,739
Any questions you have either for the exam or what you are going to do in life

521
01:23:20,740 --> 01:23:27,640
or next year when they feel free to stop and talk to me any time I'm happy to,

522
01:23:28,060 --> 01:23:35,830
you know, keep the conversation going. And you being a great class and I'm really happy to have met you.

523
01:23:37,330 --> 01:23:47,950
See you and I want to I what is it going to cost means a lot to us.

524
01:23:50,710 --> 01:24:02,400
I've heard a lot about, you know. Need to be ready.

525
01:24:03,530 --> 01:24:14,810
Yeah, I know what you mean.

526
01:24:16,580 --> 01:24:20,300
I like to think that there's a waiting list like you.

527
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:24,960
I don't know what I'll do. Yeah, okay.

528
01:24:25,130 --> 01:24:29,640
I'll even do that. Yeah. Yeah, I gotcha.

529
01:24:30,340 --> 01:24:34,700
Sorry. I was going to say, like, I'll be here at the moment.

530
01:24:35,180 --> 01:24:38,950
Oh, okay. Yeah. So I think she said she wasn't going to. So.

531
01:24:39,500 --> 01:24:46,170
So. Okay. I don't know.

532
01:24:46,710 --> 01:24:54,110
Yeah, well, I'm like. I don't know. I don't know that there are that many people I know to help me.

533
01:24:54,430 --> 01:24:57,710
And I'm like, Oh.
