1
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,160
In this module, I'm
going to give you

2
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,155
an introduction to the
built environment.

3
00:00:13,155 --> 00:00:15,930
But first, I want you to
think about where you live,

4
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:17,310
the structure you live in,

5
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,310
the neighborhood, the
city or surrounding area.

6
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:22,320
Now think about whether that area

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,550
and structure and neighborhood

8
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:24,690
are likely to improve

9
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:26,790
your health or maybe
harm your health.

10
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:28,770
How would you even go
about assessing that?

11
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:31,260
In this module, I'll be
giving you an introduction

12
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,490
to what we're referring to when

13
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:33,810
we talk about the
built environment,

14
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:36,240
but also an overview of how
we can go about assessing

15
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,900
that to evaluate its
impacts on public health.

16
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,840
All aspects of the physical
places we live and work.

17
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,180
So that would include
the homes we live in,

18
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,685
the buildings that
we work or study in,

19
00:00:46,685 --> 00:00:49,085
the streets that
we get around on,

20
00:00:49,085 --> 00:00:52,580
open spaces including parks
that we purposely construct

21
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:56,360
for pleasure and leisure,
and infrastructure.

22
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,880
We know from a
large existing body

23
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,530
of research that the
built environment

24
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:02,450
absolutely influences
public health

25
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:05,215
particularly in terms of
risk of chronic disease.

26
00:01:05,215 --> 00:01:07,070
Part of the reason for that

27
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:08,960
is that a lot of the built
environments that we've

28
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,670
designed are not good at

29
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:13,295
facilitating health
or healthy behaviors.

30
00:01:13,295 --> 00:01:15,755
I think it's very difficult
to look at a picture

31
00:01:15,755 --> 00:01:18,725
of thousands of people
sitting in traffic and think,

32
00:01:18,725 --> 00:01:21,040
this is a healthy situation.

33
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,870
I want to highlight
that when we're

34
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:24,230
talking about the
built environment,

35
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:25,720
we can come back to our exposure

36
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,745
disease framework of source,

37
00:01:27,745 --> 00:01:30,130
and movement of pollutants,
and human exposure,

38
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:33,070
and dose ultimately leading
to an adverse health effect.

39
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:34,270
We need to understand when we're

40
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:35,575
talking about built environment,

41
00:01:35,575 --> 00:01:37,000
all of these steps of

42
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,500
the exposure disease framework

43
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,080
exist within the
built environment.

44
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,760
So the importance of the built

45
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,170
environment to public health has

46
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:47,290
become increasingly apparent
over the past 200 years.

47
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:48,530
In the late 1800,

48
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:50,380
we really started
to implement for

49
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:53,260
the first time a systematic
approach to urban planning,

50
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:54,460
no longer were towns

51
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:57,100
evolving in a completely
unplanned fashion.

52
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,990
We really started to focus on

53
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:01,510
developing comprehensive
sewer system approaches.

54
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:02,650
We needed a way

55
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:05,870
desperately to safely
dispose of human waste.

56
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:09,320
In the early 1900 began
construction projects of

57
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,390
public water and
sewer infrastructure

58
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:12,920
here in the United States.

59
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:17,690
In 1927, the Standard City
Planning Enabling Act passed.

60
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:20,270
In 1934, the Federal
Housing Authority

61
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,590
was created and this resulted

62
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:25,705
in major impacts in how
urban development occurred.

63
00:02:25,705 --> 00:02:28,200
Then in the 1950s and 1960s,

64
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,070
the interstate highway system
was created that connected

65
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:32,870
our urban areas and we also

66
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:35,615
started to see urban
renewal efforts.

67
00:02:35,615 --> 00:02:38,450
So let's consider how
built environment

68
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,820
interrelates with other
determinants of health.

69
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,560
So the image you're
looking at here,

70
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,455
I'll refer to as a square
onion with many layers.

71
00:02:45,455 --> 00:02:47,910
If we look at the very
center of that image,

72
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,580
you'll see of course
that all of us have

73
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,530
innate unique features
to ourselves,

74
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:53,195
our age, our sex,

75
00:02:53,195 --> 00:02:56,450
our race, other biological
characteristics.

76
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:58,340
Around those
characteristics, of course,

77
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,050
we have our individual behaviors

78
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:02,275
which also serve
to make us unique.

79
00:03:02,275 --> 00:03:05,130
As individuals, we exist
within social, family,

80
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:06,570
and community networks, so that's

81
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:08,925
the next outermost ring.

82
00:03:08,925 --> 00:03:11,750
Finally, we come to living
and working conditions,

83
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,030
and so this is where the
built environment resides.

84
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,305
So we can think about lots

85
00:03:15,305 --> 00:03:17,150
different living and
working conditions.

86
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:20,960
We've got psycho-social
factors, socio-economic status,

87
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,049
we have both the natural
and built environments,

88
00:03:24,049 --> 00:03:27,080
public health services,
and access to healthcare.

89
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,480
Then all of those
conditions exist

90
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,065
within the broader
social and economic,

91
00:03:32,065 --> 00:03:34,520
cultural, environmental,
and health conditions

92
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,100
and policies that frame
our entire lives.

93
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,830
So you can see each
ring of the onion here

94
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:42,990
basically exists over the
entire course of our lifespan,

95
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,510
and we may see changes in

96
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:46,910
many of those rings
over our lives.

97
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:49,550
So the built environment is
considered under living and

98
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:51,050
working conditions and includes

99
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:52,715
things like transportation,

100
00:03:52,715 --> 00:03:55,115
and access to water,
and sanitation,

101
00:03:55,115 --> 00:03:58,150
and housing, and
many other factors.

102
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,900
How do we go about actually

103
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,360
measuring or assessing
the built environment?

104
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,565
We do this in three major ways.

105
00:04:04,565 --> 00:04:07,220
The first are what we
call indirect methods.

106
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,780
So this would be looking at

107
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,390
a community from the
outside and trying to get

108
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:13,610
census data or access

109
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:16,010
to geographic
information, system data,

110
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:18,410
or maybe looking at the
network of streets,

111
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:21,740
or developing from available
information from tax rolls,

112
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:25,430
for example, some kind
of index of deprivation.

113
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:28,110
We also have so-called
intermediate methods,

114
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,910
and so these might
include, for example,

115
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:32,120
using perceived environment
measures that you

116
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,580
might actually ask
residents to complete,

117
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,530
or getting regional
land use data from

118
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:40,025
tax assessors or examining
aerial photography

119
00:04:40,025 --> 00:04:41,960
or looking at existing databases

120
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,250
and that could be
something as simple as

121
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,240
the phone book or as complex
as databases available from,

122
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,000
for example, the
Department of Agriculture.

123
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,320
Finally, we come to the direct
or gold-standard methods,

124
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,615
which typically focus on

125
00:04:53,615 --> 00:04:56,705
in-person audits of
environmental characteristics

126
00:04:56,705 --> 00:04:57,920
in a neighborhood or

127
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,330
housing development that are

128
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:02,005
completed by trained observers.

129
00:05:02,005 --> 00:05:04,530
Using these various methods,

130
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:06,920
we can come up with ways to
rate the built environments.

131
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,965
So various tools have been
developed that measure

132
00:05:09,965 --> 00:05:12,170
the built environment
and provide a score or

133
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:14,870
an index on things
like walkability,

134
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,940
or aesthetics, or safety,

135
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,740
or ease of transport, etc.

136
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,900
So the image you're
looking at here is

137
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,560
taken from a website
called walkscore.com,

138
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,550
and this website focuses on

139
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,995
assessing how walkable
neighborhoods are.

140
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:29,825
So here we've got
a screen capture

141
00:05:29,825 --> 00:05:31,850
of the City of New
York and you can

142
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:33,710
see the city basically has

143
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:36,470
a heat map of areas that
are more or less walkable,

144
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:39,050
but overall the score
is 89 out of 100,

145
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:41,765
meaning that New York
City is very walkable.

146
00:05:41,765 --> 00:05:44,000
So the nice thing about
these measurements and

147
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,340
scores and indices
is that it allows us

148
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,900
to do a semi-quantitative or

149
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,480
even a fully quantitative
comparison of

150
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,370
different built-in
environment attributes

151
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:53,510
to determine what is

152
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:57,220
most associated with better
or worse public health.

153
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,850
Finally, I want to wrap up and

154
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:00,200
talk about how we can go about

155
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,910
ensuring that the
built environments we

156
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:03,650
do construct are healthy,

157
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:06,140
and there's a number of guiding
principles we have here.

158
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,030
The first is to mix land uses,

159
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,215
so we don't want

160
00:06:09,215 --> 00:06:12,410
commercial corridors
completely isolated from

161
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:14,600
residential corridors
such that people have to

162
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,090
immediately get in a car if
they want to go to the store.

163
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:19,190
We want people they'd be
able to walk and be out in

164
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:22,085
their environment under
active transportation.

165
00:06:22,085 --> 00:06:23,780
We also want to take advantage of

166
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,820
compact building
design so rather than

167
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:29,719
sprawling endlessly out over
an ever increasing area,

168
00:06:29,719 --> 00:06:32,570
let's build our buildings
in a more compact fashion.

169
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:34,970
It's absolutely
critical that we create

170
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:37,820
a range of housing
opportunities and choices,

171
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,620
especially when we have to

172
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,900
consider low income
individuals who are most

173
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,790
vulnerable and absolutely need

174
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:46,720
access to affordable
quality housing.

175
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,880
We need to foster distinctive
attractive communities

176
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,350
with a strong sense of place.

177
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,460
No one really wants to live in

178
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,020
a neighborhood where
you say, "Meh".

179
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,610
We all want to live in a
neighborhood that's very

180
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:57,980
special and unique and welcoming.

181
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,950
We want to preserve
open-space and farmland and

182
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:03,530
natural beauty as well as
critical environmental areas,

183
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:05,720
so not everything
needs to be built.

184
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,345
We also want to direct
development towards

185
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:10,800
existing communities
wherever possible.

186
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,810
So rather than letting

187
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:13,805
an existing community decay

188
00:07:13,805 --> 00:07:15,590
and building a fancy
new community,

189
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:17,270
let's invest those resources in

190
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,555
making the existing
community better.

191
00:07:19,555 --> 00:07:21,140
We absolutely need

192
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,480
stakeholder collaboration
and the people in

193
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,770
the community need to have

194
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,960
a strong voice in their
public governance.

195
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,670
As I alluded to you earlier,

196
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:29,900
we also want to create wherever

197
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,700
possible very walkable
neighborhoods

198
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:35,360
so people can get out and enjoy
the benefits of exercise.

199
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,000
There are additional factors
we need to consider.

200
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,725
We want to increase

201
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:42,110
physical activity
opportunities for people

202
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:43,520
because there are
many health benefits

203
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,810
associated with that.

204
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:48,065
At the same time, we want to
reduce injury likelihood.

205
00:07:48,065 --> 00:07:49,820
We want to increase access to

206
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:53,525
healthy food and generally
improve air and water quality.

207
00:07:53,525 --> 00:07:56,105
Going forward, we want to
make sure we're designing

208
00:07:56,105 --> 00:07:57,800
our built environment to minimize

209
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,190
the impacts of climate change.

210
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:01,550
We want to decrease

211
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:04,040
mental health stresses
wherever possible.

212
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,750
We also want to focus
on strengthening

213
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,910
the social fabric of
community because again,

214
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:11,090
it's often that social fabric
that creates a community

215
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,830
that's welcoming and interesting

216
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,270
and desirable to live in.

217
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:17,390
Finally, we absolutely
want to improve and

218
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,010
achieve health equity and provide

219
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:20,900
fair access to livelihood,

220
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:24,305
education, resources,
and good health.

221
00:08:24,305 --> 00:08:26,960
So hopefully you now have
a better sense of what

222
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,120
I mean when I say built
environment and of

223
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,160
some of the impacts the built
environment can have on

224
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,709
our health and how we can
go about assessing those,

225
00:08:33,709 --> 00:08:35,600
identifying problems
and addressing

226
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,770
them so we can improve

227
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:38,120
public health simply by

228
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,472
the way we design our
built environment.
