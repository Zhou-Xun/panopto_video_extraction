1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:04,140
And I realized that the real world is over.

2
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:11,940
All right. Today, we have a lot of sense to discuss.

3
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:21,240
First that I will talk about the developments for regulating and testing of new vaccines.

4
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:28,830
Basically, this is the essential process.

5
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:36,830
All right. So developments of regulation and testing of new vaccines.

6
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:48,590
These were largely based on traditionally and in a normal situation, how this process would be.

7
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:58,190
But the stop, the momentum later will come to show a lot of the information and the, you know,

8
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:09,500
emergency use authorizations, which, of course, is not followed in the traditional timeline for the.

9
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,810
You develop your passion.

10
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:28,290
But I think it's important for you to understand the typical process, what's involved still most banks that are developing that way.

11
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:35,300
So last week we had the discussion on evolution of banks and problems.

12
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:46,800
But today we also can highlight some of the changes in the process of vaccine development.

13
00:01:47,400 --> 00:02:04,550
Partly is due to the advancements of technology that will also impact the advancement of the technology, also impact our ability to develop a vaccine.

14
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,180
The speed of vaccine development that's more complete.

15
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:22,260
The story about the innovative medicines to develop the vaccine should also include the clinical trials, which you will discuss on evidence later.

16
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,310
Then, hopefully by the end of the first half of this semester,

17
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:40,800
you were have a pretty good big picture of vaccine development process, the steps and the challenges.

18
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:49,680
So what I thought we could do is to focus on this several areas.

19
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:59,660
First, that if you are involved in some development or immunization program, you were going to learn from terminologies.

20
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:11,340
So in the back impacts, not only to some of the common use, common to use the terms, they have different or extended meanings.

21
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:21,660
I were first to highlight a few common use the definitions that terminology for vaccine development.

22
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:32,040
Then today's most important topic was the process the stages of vaccine development.

23
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:38,540
In discussing this also for you where see how each field,

24
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:53,669
each field of biomedical science or biomedical engineer actually are involved at different stage and then maybe start to think

25
00:03:53,670 --> 00:04:08,940
about your career plan where you might be interested in looking so and then definitely talking about vaccine development.

26
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:17,760
I also would like to introduce you to the regulations, and that is, since your principles are for new vaccine licensure,

27
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:35,309
many of you, if not all, will be involved in this kind of research need to discover a vaccine candidate or an immunization program.

28
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:42,959
If you work in public health, practice is not to get involved in that kind of work.

29
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,410
So understand your vaccine license.

30
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:57,060
You also post the message epidemiologist, public health professional really have a lot of to do with that type of work,

31
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:02,640
which is as important as the preclinical development.

32
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,180
And so we are so used COVID 19 vaccine.

33
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:15,240
There are so many studies to be further advanced after this emergency use authorization.

34
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:29,520
Then Maxim Funding sources and pricing is some general principle where the funds come and then go for resources supporting vaccine development.

35
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:42,410
For those of you who may be interested in Google Health, a career in global health that can be very relevant.

36
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:51,110
So what's some of the commonly used terminology environments and development?

37
00:05:51,230 --> 00:06:04,700
First, biological products. I think it's very easier to understand when we see biological products that really cover a wide range of products,

38
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:14,600
any absence, blood and blood products which you use as a treatment for some of these patients.

39
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:18,280
Diagnostics. Gene therapy.

40
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:22,400
Biotechnology. Products. Any kinds of cytokines.

41
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:33,950
And the growth factors. So tissue products are pretty helpful to the prevention, treatment or cure of disease or condition of the human beings.

42
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:38,000
So basically, any products that.

43
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:45,140
Applicable to the prevention, treatment or cure for his condition.

44
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:54,870
Human beings and the vaccine definitely is one major category of these such products.

45
00:06:55,020 --> 00:07:06,780
And also our Tagalog speaks like different to test the kids test aging or our passive immunization products,

46
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:12,060
which is not vaccine but is a useful prevention of food disease.

47
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:20,040
After being exposed to antiserum or those 13 took biological products as biological products.

48
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:29,210
Yeah. You have to meet a. Let's drink to regulations as it would be applied to humans.

49
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:41,150
Of course, some biological problem could be ex use not to introduce into human, but so still accurate.

50
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:50,180
Accuracy. Accurate the term the condition is also.

51
00:07:51,480 --> 00:08:02,940
So another sets of particular and important term terms used in vaccine development.

52
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:08,330
This is particularly relevant to vaccine personal safety.

53
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:13,320
As you know, our clinical trial one basically is to evaluate safety.

54
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:20,510
So when we say safety, it's the I think you can easily memorize all this.

55
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:21,410
But I agree.

56
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:35,669
Let's say you understand, for example, safety is a relative freedom from harmful effects to people affected directly or indirectly by a product.

57
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:47,490
It wouldn't bother me sort of taking into consideration the character of the product in relation to the condition of the recipient at the time.

58
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:53,940
So here I think it's very important to to pay attention to these words,

59
00:08:54,060 --> 00:09:01,500
the relative freedom and also the last part in relation to the condition of the recipient.

60
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:11,400
At the same time, what does this mean when we see a relative and relative freedom from harmful effects?

61
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:16,709
And we also define this, we talk about the safety.

62
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:21,080
It's in relation to the condition of the recipient of the pipe.

63
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:32,070
So what's the implication for public health practice or immunization or vaccine development is what does this make you think?

64
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:43,290
When we say relative freedom, you can think that for any example and to.

65
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:53,200
Explain what this means. I have more of question for you.

66
00:09:53,200 --> 00:10:00,070
Standardize safety. Because I guess.

67
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:06,830
Obviously what one person thinks to say differs from. So what?

68
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,910
Yeah, it's a good question.

69
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:15,890
Actually, you did your question.

70
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:23,810
In a way, it's kind of food, you know, leads to the explanation what this means.

71
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:31,280
Yes. The question is how you determine it's safe for one person, but nothing is safe for another person.

72
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:38,450
So in other words, this is safety is a relative concept when we say safe.

73
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:46,910
For example, if your life are going to the banks that can be safe for immunocompromised,

74
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:56,960
individual, BCT and other life can use the mycobacterial vaccine against the people.

75
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:05,020
It's safe to you to use that for all the children we sell to you and with the company.

76
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:16,940
But for people who have compromised immune, they may not be as safe or expect as severe.

77
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:26,240
So this means and the safety concept when we may back and say this is a safe for use,

78
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:38,450
this is in the context for normal people, people with normal immunity to give to the question that just ask.

79
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:43,050
It's a. No.

80
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:47,070
The vaccine is safe for everyone.

81
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:56,910
But we are facing we based on clinical trials in phase one, first seen to measure this safety.

82
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:09,930
So this means phase one trial I talk about and much more later is a tool in the health volunteer healthy volunteers.

83
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:15,120
So to answer your question is how that measured.

84
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:21,360
We measured that in the normal population, people with normal immunity.

85
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:29,909
And the better we can see, it is a potential problem for those who do not have normal, who have compromised.

86
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:42,320
Immune for that to release a live attenuated vaccine are generally not recommended for immunocompromised the individual.

87
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:47,970
What can they be who might be immunocompromised?

88
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:58,200
Older people. Older people. Yes. The decline immunity and.

89
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:08,370
I mean, illnesses such as such, people with different illnesses.

90
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:18,000
Such as? Yeah, people have the different journeys that could come from HIV infection, for example.

91
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,830
That's that's definitely what cancer. Cancer patients.

92
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:34,890
Some treatments that could also come from chemotherapy could come from both you and some transplant surgery.

93
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:50,550
Post transplant surgery people are patients and steer the treatment, which is also, you know, separate, immune from the individual.

94
00:13:50,790 --> 00:14:01,090
So not just the memories of safety and what really understand this means you really have to come see the individual surgery.

95
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:13,170
And yes, when you say relative freedom from know like most people don't know actually can you define what relative freedom means, not contact?

96
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:16,560
Yeah, relative to me, it's not a absolutely.

97
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:20,610
It's you know, when we say safe, it's not absolute.

98
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:25,390
When you see relative. I'm not it's good question. Another thing to think about,

99
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:38,260
way to think about is relative freedom is when we to a tenured person and we remove the possibility that better it's relatively

100
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:52,680
we know maybe for for individuals who have normal immunity it's really no harm and but for people who have compromised immunity,

101
00:14:52,950 --> 00:15:02,730
it may not happen. And also the process itself, it's a based on our understanding of the science, of the biology of the pathogen,

102
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:12,870
especially in the old time when the generation is some mature experiments of the generations of generations,

103
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:29,280
acculturation in doctors setting, so used to the animal studies to show safe animal and not so all the human disease can mimic animal models.

104
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:35,080
So what you learned from there may not sort of continue to translate into what you would find.

105
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:41,880
So this is not just for this particular term of the standard.

106
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:49,260
It's in general in biomedical research. You always you want to have that kind of thinking.

107
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:58,260
A person is relative. There is it's true for certain under certain conditions.

108
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:05,490
So when the condition turns, okay, even today I work for.

109
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:13,170
So that's more when we talk about safety. There is also genetic predisposition for certain response.

110
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:25,040
So that's I think purity when we say purity and that's a relative freedom from a truly is

111
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:31,590
matter regardless of whether it's harmful to the recipient or the tears to the product.

112
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:41,870
So this is another important concept. This is not has not to do with safety or effective.

113
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:49,470
It's basically when we do a product, we want to have the maximum.

114
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:59,260
You know, come some traditional idea of concentration of the intended product.

115
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:03,350
But if it's antigen, that's antigen.

116
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:15,590
If it's antibodies and this means your product is meant to perform as much the intended product as possible.

117
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:19,400
Any others? And no matter if it's a handful, it's not.

118
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,790
It's a kind of impurity.

119
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:29,800
When you have more impurities, of course, you could expect even it's not harmful.

120
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:44,570
It could potentially reduce the potency of your biological products because of the materials that's reduced when you have other impurity.

121
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:51,920
But the impurity doesn't. This would be harmful, but they could mean reduce the potency.

122
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:56,000
Then the next term used a lot is potency.

123
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:06,440
What were you to facts and evaluation? You're often where gets to interpret use this quickly here to discuss the vaccine

124
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:17,600
effectiveness and also interpret the potential course for reduce the protection or influence.

125
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:31,370
And the potency is the specific ability or capacity of this product as indicated by appropriate laboratory tests or by I had

126
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:47,170
to prove to be controlled state of Texas administration of the product in the manner intended to effect the marketing result.

127
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:52,370
So what is this? Is that how strong your product is?

128
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:58,240
If this product is antibody, how how high is upstream?

129
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:10,800
How strong it can neutralize the antigen if is the vaccine for active immunization, how strong it can induce immunity.

130
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:24,350
Basically, it's talk about the ability, the capacity of the product to produce the anticipate the or intended the effect.

131
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:41,720
So that's the potency purity is if there is a lot of this vaccine is not so pure and this may be, you know,

132
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:55,580
less safe than the answer is not necessarily it depends on the materials that contributes to the impurity is harmful or not harmful to the body.

133
00:19:55,820 --> 00:20:09,410
So this purity is only means that's how much you were intended products is in the final product.

134
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:17,270
What any questions I want you to be able to use this of and that's just.

135
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:26,120
Memorize. I'm sure I have a good standard.

136
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:31,790
This is also in vaccinology immunization. We often were running to this certain.

137
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:38,000
When we see standards, it's really mean to to sense in practice and research.

138
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:45,139
Once the specifications and procedures applicable to establishment manufacturer, for example,

139
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:54,440
or to the manufacture or lab or release of product that's designed to ensure the continuous safety,

140
00:20:54,980 --> 00:21:00,410
purity and the potency of biological products, basically.

141
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:06,229
In other words, quick here and to safety here and purity procure potency.

142
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:12,680
Could you or these you can make sure you better or you animal and this is what's the

143
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:23,000
manufacture want to follow this standard it's also ever has the authority overseeing the

144
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:31,340
manufacture where have these standards use these standard to sample the products so to

145
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:40,310
to survey and that's the standards which you I think everyone could easily understand.

146
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:46,310
Another is we really talk about our reference products preparation.

147
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:52,549
So that's the and that's the use of these terms is, for example,

148
00:21:52,550 --> 00:22:07,790
if you run a clinical trial and or if you want to do a vaccine clinical trial, you sometimes if it's a vaccine that's already well developed,

149
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:17,640
the approved a proven effective vaccine that very trial could the sponsor this kind of standards of

150
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:27,170
release when I was doing my two years fellowship in Copenhagen Stern Serum Institute in Copenhagen.

151
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:31,129
I told you about that. Yeah.

152
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:35,640
I was working in a reference lab, W.H.O. for BCG.

153
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:51,140
So they produce the BCG vaccine and other a TB diagnostic has the agent to distribute to all the researchers around the world or free of charge.

154
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:59,500
You can use that to standardize your you vaccinate people in the process of developing your new vaccine.

155
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:12,620
You use that for comparison. If you run large clinical trials, whenever that virtual standard is available, you use that as a comparison to do so.

156
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:20,240
When we see standards are really crude to have different forms basically to any questions.

157
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:39,250
Yeah those versus mature distribution is the free butter and you need to put an application states what you were intended to use it.

158
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:52,900
And typically you get a very detailed protocol on how to use them that will help to standardize your process of evaluating your product.

159
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:57,210
Another term is effectiveness.

160
00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:03,940
Basically, there is a reasonable expectation that a significant proportion of the target population.

161
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:12,629
It's a proportion here. So in other words, none of the vaccines or diagnostics.

162
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:16,270
So we could we would expect 100%.

163
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:25,890
So but it's give to the reasonable expectation depends on how mature this vaccine development is.

164
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:34,570
If it's the first time like a given for malaria vaccine, when it's roll out for your use.

165
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:43,750
It's not what we typically expect or those of where people work are 98% or 95% for 40.

166
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:50,260
And even it's up to, you know, 56%.

167
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:59,860
You still have just start to do some use then build more data for for future development.

168
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:13,450
So this is very important for several surfers and points to notice why is this is a reasonable expectation.

169
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:21,520
How high how effective what's the protective efficacy where depends on the disease.

170
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:33,100
The challenge of the vaccine development. It's not that's one you don't have one number, say 95% for all the bugs.

171
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:37,610
It depends on which you stay in these six or.

172
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:54,370
And another important point to note here is admissions and adequate direction for use and warning against unsafe use.

173
00:25:55,300 --> 00:26:11,750
So this is very important because a perfect use for a good vaccine can act not to protect you from or no protection if it's not done correctly.

174
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:15,400
A good example for that is like a vaccine.

175
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:23,560
I'm it's a life I can use embodies strength made for people.

176
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:31,480
But because it's a life mycobacteria is very sensitive to light UV light particularly

177
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:39,459
and I hope this some vaccination campaign people who do a lot of the task of pull out

178
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:45,070
a basket from you know countrysides elementary school just pull out the table to put

179
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:53,410
it in the school courtyard and where are the kids lined up to get their vaccination?

180
00:26:53,800 --> 00:27:00,190
You work all your life backs. So then at the end you say, oh, this these vaccines not infected.

181
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:04,120
You didn't do it. Is that correct?

182
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:11,150
That direction. So if you go to immunization practices, you really pay attention to that.

183
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:23,590
It's not so safe if they say if the instructions say you open the apple your own, you can keep this open a bottle for 2 hours.

184
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:33,280
Otherwise you were just God. That's in a lot of resource limited to seeking it don't necessarily do because they

185
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:40,000
don't want to waste your vaccines or take a lot of things so it could get contamination.

186
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:44,500
And then when you have adverse events, you really don't know if it's a vaccine.

187
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:55,989
And like the B.C. human rights practice us in the U.K., BCG, when I was in Denmark,

188
00:27:55,990 --> 00:28:03,460
I got the BCG Revaccination because somehow I never had a positive skin test.

189
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:13,930
So all the clinics have a black window and we're poor down those back curtain because they want to protect the.

190
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:20,840
Effects of the vaccine.

191
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:24,590
So that's the terminology.

192
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:29,510
But the. Not just the memories.

193
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:33,890
Understand what this is. And, of course, she's.

194
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:44,780
Okay. If it's clear we were revisited, I would start to talk about the, uh.

195
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:52,380
Stages of vaccine development. So you and I have we includes a couple of differences.

196
00:28:54,090 --> 00:29:04,980
Resource is a source of information. Basically, they all they together highlight the importance of stages of the vaccine.

197
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:10,410
I made these slides based on the vaccine for this phase.

198
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:14,820
I showed you the first. They are usually carried through the Constitution.

199
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:22,170
So the first step before our vaccine development,

200
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:35,800
I want you to have these these charts in your mind and also think about where your future work or where your you know,

201
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:40,970
what you know, the public health professional doing can fit.

202
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:53,070
And the first is that basically it's developed for development of rational based on disease, pathogenesis and epidemiology.

203
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:56,640
So what kind of is that? What does that mean?

204
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:05,340
It's hard to explain. What does this mean?

205
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:13,920
Developing the sense of rational what's a rational, rational forecast for leading our banks?

206
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:18,930
Right. And so what's the information you need to to get?

207
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:27,120
You need to know that this is something that, like you're like a vaccine worker.

208
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:35,190
So, like, you need to know that giving your immune system the information about the pathogen will actually help fight it off in the future.

209
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:42,330
So you need to understand that's a cancer genesis is a pathogen.

210
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:47,300
You also need to know the epidemiology here.

211
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:51,190
We would. Well, I see development so rational.

212
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:58,890
Thank you. Is really just the fight for developing a vaccine.

213
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:07,680
Developing a vaccine cost the enormous amount and the normal process would take 10 to 15 years to get a vaccine developed.

214
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:15,450
And for a long time, pharmaceutical company was not so interested in vaccine development because most

215
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:24,000
of the vaccines needed by the developed nations were normative profit to make.

216
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:35,780
And the COVID 19 is a different story because it impacts everyone in the world, both people and nations.

217
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:40,830
But when we say develop rational based on disease,

218
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:49,140
pathogenesis and the epidemic of what this means is you want to do a justification

219
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:56,100
if the vaccine is going to really impact the disease prevention country,

220
00:31:56,460 --> 00:32:09,210
you're always the face of question. It's more cost effective to develop drugs or it's better to develop a vaccine for some disease.

221
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:15,030
That's the epidemiology. Studies have shown how it's transmitted.

222
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:18,960
It's people to person to person transmission.

223
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:31,020
Those disease doesn't if you were had Fukuda rationale especially impacts so many people like to you know one had polio and the smallpox and the

224
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:43,740
measles to the COVID 19 that from date especially it transmits this person to person and to either direct the contact or to share the airspace.

225
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:47,190
Or these could be just by this.

226
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,940
How do we know these? We have to study pathogenesis.

227
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:57,510
We have to study epidemiology. We have to understand how the disease is spread.

228
00:32:58,050 --> 00:33:05,390
So that's why you want to do the remaining medical and in academia.

229
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:10,560
So I work here and understand, hence the genesis of the disease.

230
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:14,130
No matter if it's the infectious disease or chronic,

231
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:32,790
they try to understand that so that you can see if there is vaccine where and if the population gives a vaccine or can be indirectly affect.

232
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:40,060
And if so, I suppose that this is clear.

233
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:43,680
But I also want to ask a question.

234
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:57,480
If a disease is not infected, the is the infection is not so human to human is that's a counter justification for vaccine development.

235
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:11,120
No. Why not? I'd like you know, like you're saying, if it's if it's like, not human to human at all or if it's not only human to do it.

236
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:18,310
No, I'm it's not to the human to human transmission to way to.

237
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:22,970
We still can't justify for developing a vaccine.

238
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:27,050
Yes. Yes. Give me an example.

239
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:36,200
Well, like with monkey pox greatly, humans in developing countries have more contact with animals that carry that disease.

240
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:46,280
Yeah, that's. That's. Yeah, yeah. You can hopefully, you know, succumb to second vector or this one.

241
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:51,530
And in fact, this is a good thing.

242
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:59,450
But I think, you know, it's a correct answer, not necessarily that.

243
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:14,390
So we don't need to we were never make a vaccine that's of against the disease, not just so human to human transmission.

244
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:20,560
We had four actually and successful example of the tetanus vaccine.

245
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:25,990
It's not a human to human. It's a through the companion.

246
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:34,930
So we have and you know, you would not have to buy some company.

247
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:50,720
Right. So why are we to still sometimes develop a vaccine for some disease like that if it's not through human to human transmission?

248
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:57,940
And then, uh, you would have not to expect a herd immunity and a protection.

249
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:01,760
Right. We still want a vaccine like that.

250
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:11,360
This is no cure so far as just a prevention method or even for some other diseases.

251
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:21,890
Even after you get it. If you get the vaccine, it is perhaps your immune system to help you find it now that you're talking about it.

252
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:36,770
One possibility that's true and this is actually more this goal was accomplished by passive immunization, gave antibodies, that kind of thing.

253
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:39,950
But you still could have some catch up. That's true.

254
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:53,550
But the answer to that one person is if this disease is life story and there's no cure, if you look at tetanus infection, it's really sad.

255
00:36:53,600 --> 00:37:00,030
Once you look up and you, you know, you basically don't have the cure.

256
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:05,450
That's why you want to prevent. So in other words, if we support an impact population,

257
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:17,530
if the disease it's a you know cause that's hard to cure that would also be another would would like rabies be another example.

258
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:22,170
Or is that different? You know, it really is to have a vaccine.

259
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:35,430
Yeah. Because speak up for rabies. When I was in Haiti clinic, I saw people who type came after, you know, infected the dog.

260
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:39,390
And this was a teenage boy from countryside.

261
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:46,910
It's really sad. I remember I was seeing I evening we were all sitting you know where you are medical students.

262
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:53,299
You never want to go home. You always look for some of you need to go a surgery or a different.

263
00:37:53,300 --> 00:38:00,050
So even it's not your turn. So you were staying in the office all the time.

264
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:12,740
And I remember that I was out then I heard a lot of people urging stems a and I ways

265
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:24,600
like ten 11:00 you know and then the super farmers men had carried the boys into fear.

266
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:26,180
Then I saw my physician,

267
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:40,280
a professor was trying to pest and the use of a lunchbox and he just grabbed just a spoon to to have the water is fed up to them the droplets.

268
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:48,230
Great. That's a what's the sense? That's a trick of the Spanish flu, this pestilence infected with people.

269
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:55,460
And then I saw these boys who really had severe pain in response to that.

270
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,940
That is so sad. His mother's safe.

271
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:12,590
His father was working in rain from village to village as a carpenter and finally got the money that they could use to bring him to the hospital.

272
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:17,240
But it was too late. He died. But people don't have that know.

273
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:23,930
Just sort of how we finally had the money. Let's go rush to the city and save lives.

274
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:30,410
So for disease, the cure was just not so possible.

275
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:35,390
And the window for trees is so, so narrow.

276
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:38,860
You you can save a life by fax.

277
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:41,740
So that's why we have hope.

278
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:55,460
Where it's development, rational doctors hope will come to talk about the cost effective analyze more in more detail later.

279
00:39:55,970 --> 00:40:08,270
So after announcing the word immunity, I id that the freelance talk has introduced you to all kind of investment, especially reverse vaccinology.

280
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:14,300
So we do this so differently today than we used to in the old time.

281
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:21,260
You have to be able to copy the pathogen first, and then you would be able to to, you know,

282
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:30,169
do animal studies, in vitro immunological studies to identify the good, the antigen.

283
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:34,600
But to date, it's not completely like that.

284
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:42,580
Like a COVID 19, you do reverse vaccinology, you you use the genomic information,

285
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:48,730
you start sitting on the computer to analyze all the symptoms, then you go back to test.

286
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:58,550
That's a save a lot of time. So development of manufacture process, when we talk about the vaccine, people never forgot this stuff.

287
00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:04,880
I worked in some capacity like this for many years and you have to establish.

288
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:14,760
Manufacture process standard protocol so that labor bands produce produced for larger scale use will be consistent.

289
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:32,550
So never forgot this is that the non clinical studies that precludes study Pinsky's animal studies or large studies clinical the lung human studies.

290
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:41,129
Then another thing I want to point out is a general investigation play where you

291
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:47,100
answer a question what's the status in box and you've never forgot this stage.

292
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:53,100
This is an extensive stated, basically the study proposal, developmental stage.

293
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:59,580
There are many type of requirements for this stage and then you will go to a

294
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:04,800
different phase of clinical trials of the different skills with a different focus,

295
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:10,350
which I put here, just so you know, the steps.

296
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:20,360
But so we were expensive to cross the session to discuss clinical trials, traditional way and the innovative way.

297
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:31,620
So I'm not going to focus too much on these date, but just to go from emerging ID animal study, then jump to cutting trial,

298
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:41,900
forget to mention manufacturing process development and this is a huge extensive work of how to manufacture this

299
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:50,220
might be happens in academic setting or collaboration between academia and the industry and the public health.

300
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:57,900
But this is within the manufacture, lack of faith, and without all of these in the manufacture.

301
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:10,490
And this can be done within manufacture, mostly in collaboration with some academia researchers.

302
00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:20,270
This is a proposal you need to establish a lot of evidence before you can move this.

303
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:29,140
I have some students that jump from here to here, then to clinical trials, not to mention in general education,

304
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:35,700
and to also notice after three trial you have a biological license application.

305
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:41,350
These include the two components. One is the products, the license.

306
00:43:41,370 --> 00:43:45,420
Another is establishments, places of manufacture.

307
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:52,050
They used to be two separate license. Now they code or biological license.

308
00:43:52,890 --> 00:44:00,800
But it really includes not just how good your final product is, the three batches sent to test.

309
00:44:01,290 --> 00:44:08,459
It's the if you are manufacture or you lab meets the good manufacture practices

310
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:18,480
standard you know the FDA in these countries and then another and to use.

311
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:29,340
We don't learn everything about the vaccine's safety effectiveness based on just the

312
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:41,220
preclinical stage because some of the real adverse events would not be able to consent.

313
00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:55,860
And also clinical trial may not cover as supports of human diversity has such diversity and in the real words of situation.

314
00:44:56,430 --> 00:45:03,870
For that reason we need to post the licensure evaluation and what's involved.

315
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:13,380
A lot of everything you study in the pre-clinical and then you also and these are not release.

316
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:21,180
This is to to exam how consistent the manufacture process.

317
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:25,680
Okay. And of course, this is a super important.

318
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:31,740
Yes. Explain more what they usually do during the journey.

319
00:45:33,850 --> 00:45:37,020
Oh, yes, I will talk about that a little bit.

320
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:42,240
Like, yes, you have to have a lot of information for person.

321
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:46,499
This feels like it's just the flow and how that works.

322
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:54,000
And you can see this is similar basic vaccine research, your medical needs, disease burden.

323
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:57,480
This is what we say, epidemiology evidence.

324
00:45:57,930 --> 00:46:03,720
This is all the justification stage.

325
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:10,590
Then here is what we called the Immunology Discover stage.

326
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:19,920
Then you need to develop, manufacture and the doing all the preclinical has the in vitro and in animals.

327
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:30,660
So you can kind of align this chart with the previous one to get to even better understand the product's character vision.

328
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:44,190
That's basically to see if it's the same, if it's important, if you know it can induce the anticipated protection and then rescue management plan.

329
00:46:44,610 --> 00:46:51,510
If this is what I would talk about later to the general investigation.

330
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:57,150
Then you have to have this risk management plan in that.

331
00:46:57,630 --> 00:47:01,080
And that's a new investigational plan.

332
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:09,990
You were hired for all the information coming out of from from the preclinical study.

333
00:47:10,470 --> 00:47:18,020
Manufacture process. All information needs to be in that plan plus risk management.

334
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:30,899
The course when you go into the clinical trial, you may be expected to see some adverse events or yes, some secondary.

335
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:42,210
You have to stop. So that's the process then phase four and that's your you study as a scientific question with some larger sense.

336
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:54,420
This is the traditional vaccine development pathway, which is similar to what we talked about, but already the two slides.

337
00:47:54,450 --> 00:48:03,569
You can compare all three. It's just a little different way in the literature we talk about this is cover and a targeted validation.

338
00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:10,870
So these were actually helpful parts of the rationale step out.

339
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:22,830
I prefer to have a rational this is a jump to the immune gene anticipation in fact that before that this rational development.

340
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:29,640
A lot of epidemiology medical research before you decide that you need the vaccine.

341
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:35,610
Yes. I want to emphasize this, that because I see you would be a public health professional.

342
00:48:35,970 --> 00:48:38,970
So rationality is important.

343
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:47,700
So this study sample you don't have to memorize had 100 words on the plan.

344
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:55,470
You just want to see the size increase for each trial.

345
00:48:55,980 --> 00:49:06,660
And then you have the assignment of did you ever visit a assignment site where I describe what would be done?

346
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:10,610
Have you seen that? It's already happening.

347
00:49:10,770 --> 00:49:17,400
I would make sure when I go. So go to look at assignment and the clinical trial.

348
00:49:17,790 --> 00:49:24,540
If you have time before next week's class, you may start to upload your assignments.

349
00:49:24,570 --> 00:49:28,700
You were open Monday. Okay.

350
00:49:29,270 --> 00:49:32,870
If we're open, I will open that on Monday.

351
00:49:33,230 --> 00:49:38,330
And basically, you want to find those three articles, published articles.

352
00:49:39,650 --> 00:49:44,870
This will prepare you for our later discussion about clinical trials.

353
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:49,220
It's also assignments where writes a summary of them.

354
00:49:49,550 --> 00:49:54,860
So that's the assignment.

355
00:49:55,220 --> 00:50:00,590
Two Step one find use the article and others summarize that.

356
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:06,020
So this is, as you can see, this is a timeline.

357
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:13,030
It's much longer than what we have some COVID 19 development.

358
00:50:13,190 --> 00:50:24,590
You can see even in the first step and here you can do some clinical trials 3 to 8 years and 2 to 10 years for the clinical trials.

359
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:36,690
Depends on if it's an acute infection within a short time in a seasonal or some seasonal disease, like a flu within a short time.

360
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:48,950
You see a lot of cases. In that case, your clinical trial will be shorter or longer when you can within a short time, see a lot of cases.

361
00:50:49,430 --> 00:50:58,320
If we select for an acute infection cause cancer, would you need a longer clinical trial or shorter?

362
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:04,460
Shorter is shorter. Yes. And the parts of possibly disease.

363
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:08,120
Most of the infected people don't develop a few things like TB.

364
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:16,480
Only 5 to 10% of the immunocompromised individuals develop disease within the first two years of exposure,

365
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:22,760
infection, and the majority of people may not develop the disease until they get older.

366
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:31,190
There you see it. You know, it's a surprise for different reasons.

367
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:39,230
So that's why this clinical trial can last from 2 to 10 years.

368
00:51:39,470 --> 00:51:51,020
This is just an example of the defense of vaccines, how many years it's working before it gets approved.

369
00:51:51,800 --> 00:52:02,660
No need to memorize. Just appreciate the the, you know, effort and the time required for developing a vaccine.

370
00:52:04,050 --> 00:52:19,190
And however, to take COVID 19, it's definitely one of the bizarre public health crises we had to witness in our time.

371
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:27,620
And but it's also because of the unprecedented public health crises that are emerging.

372
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:40,529
Urgency needs for vaccine. We also through the development of a COVID 19 vaccine, we have to explore the different ways that could accelerate.

373
00:52:40,530 --> 00:52:45,970
So vaccine development. And so some of the technologies we discussed, the buyback,

374
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:57,170
the freedom of the platform based on vaccine development staff working on each individual universal platform and platform of protein,

375
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:05,390
subunit vaccine or vector carries the antigen.

376
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:13,220
So that way, once you have that platform in place, you could you quickly add that to your pencil.

377
00:53:13,670 --> 00:53:22,280
So this article in Simplicity Immunology talking about transforming vaccine development after the course of your case,

378
00:53:22,910 --> 00:53:26,750
I believe you want to read more, please, to read this.

379
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:34,400
This is a figure from this article, basically give you a ratio and, you know,

380
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:43,860
impressing how that time has been shrunk to here definitely show you what kind of

381
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:51,680
a study needed to inform the vaccine development that the pre-clinical stage.

382
00:53:52,160 --> 00:54:02,750
Now it's time we had a discussion lots of field discipline in both in vaccine development to go to review this

383
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:13,460
list after the course and to see what you thought about that before and what's not come see by you people.

384
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:25,580
And this work is definitely enhance your learning uh, vaccine development understanding how different field were involved.

385
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:30,280
Some are related to technology. Relate to rational development.

386
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:37,390
Some relate to the immunology, discover and manufacture process.

387
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:45,550
It's largely depends on the platform you choose to develop the vaccine and the clinical trials.

388
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:52,060
As you can see here. It's also much reduced.

389
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:58,030
We can't see you're using the cursor. Oh, you can see.

390
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:01,390
Oh, I'm sorry. I won't go. Oh, okay.

391
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:06,070
So thank you. Always remind me if something is not working.

392
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:13,389
So I'm turning you here. Is this how you want to use these things?

393
00:55:13,390 --> 00:55:19,870
A person appreciates the facts of how the vaccine is.

394
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:28,620
Development has evolved from requiring much longer time to a much shorter time,

395
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:44,590
thanks to the evolution of vaccine technology and also innovations in clinical trial design that allows much shorter time to develop a vaccine.

396
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:54,060
And Lisa, this basically shows you the difference of feel that can be seen in the vaccine development.

397
00:55:54,390 --> 00:56:03,410
I think you talk about the so it's the it's happening in our discussing early days with the pool.

398
00:56:04,430 --> 00:56:12,749
Well will mention the many or these causes and definitely if we want to understand

399
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:19,149
the different type of studies involved in the in the earliest stage of development,

400
00:56:19,150 --> 00:56:22,770
the preclinical stage. And we you see, you know,

401
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:33,470
a controlled human infection model study is what you want to give one more thing and then difference

402
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:47,100
of platform that's what determine how long how course of the manufacture process will be.

403
00:56:47,550 --> 00:56:55,140
So these are the preclinical. Then you have the early stage of clinical evaluation.

404
00:56:55,590 --> 00:57:10,710
This is the early stage of what's really amazing is how short some have now we could accomplish phase of free trial.

405
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:18,360
We're talking about the difference innovative approach and that people design big data,

406
00:57:18,630 --> 00:57:24,040
how you take advantage of this information and the fact that you recruitment is

407
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:32,700
this was not the case back to 2016 and your traditional vaccine development.

408
00:57:33,270 --> 00:57:51,740
Um the real work data also feed back to back some assessment for the improvements of the vaccine design back to COVID 19 after we now we see this,

409
00:57:52,380 --> 00:58:03,810
you know, for for emerging self for rear and so back to real world data shows do not want to answer

410
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:16,040
leads this latest the basically covered the initial strain and also from the strain.

411
00:58:16,430 --> 00:58:27,210
So this process that we were told about that that's for now just to appreciate the evolution of this field.

412
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:28,620
It's really me.

413
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:42,940
I want to talk too much about emergency use authorization, but after a long career, tell you all the insights and stories when it comes to that.

414
00:58:42,990 --> 00:58:49,770
The basically idea this is a mechanism to facilitate the availability and use of medical countermeasures,

415
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:59,220
including vaccine to response to public health emergencies and to how that happens, what's involved.

416
00:58:59,580 --> 00:59:05,790
Basically, you meet minimum standards, you know, way and but we're telling you more stories.

417
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:19,170
You just know this always. Six months after the pandemic is started, we had the earliest vaccine in human use.

418
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:36,170
Okay. And then for competencies of a safe and the consistent vaccine manufacture, that's a has to be the data presented in the new investigation.

419
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:46,830
But you have to show the manufacturer person that defines how the product is made basically is the standard protocol.

420
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:58,020
This has to be in the investigational drug plan to show the vaccine where be produced by us, consistent,

421
00:59:58,650 --> 01:00:06,410
you know, consistent with and then the compliance of the organization to successfully complete that process.

422
01:00:06,450 --> 01:00:19,640
This is what we called vaccine industry called the Quality Assurance, Quality control and quality assurance are two different concept to use the to.

423
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:23,510
To ensure food, manufacture, practice,

424
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:37,070
quality control is to test check your final product to see if it doesn't meet the standards of safety, purity and potency.

425
01:00:37,790 --> 01:00:55,190
However, quality assurance is a set up for regulatory rules to ensure you can produce the high quality products that meet all the standards.

426
01:00:55,940 --> 01:01:00,830
We can pass quality control. And so these are true difference.

427
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:04,970
Quality control basically is check what's the final product?

428
01:01:05,390 --> 01:01:10,250
Quality assurance is to show how you are going to, you know,

429
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:21,229
comply the good manufacturing practice requirements and then ensure a positive quality

430
01:01:21,230 --> 01:01:28,580
control is that we do compliance and the testing of the product and supporting operations.

431
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:40,130
This will be reflected in quality control and quantity assurance and the regulatory authorization to release and distribute the products.

432
01:01:40,490 --> 01:01:52,219
So this practice and regulation typically is by national regulatory authorities involving assessment,

433
01:01:52,220 --> 01:01:55,940
the license, your control and the surveillance of biological products.

434
01:01:56,270 --> 01:02:08,390
It's not just the license after FDA here critical for some sort of product or test.

435
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:12,760
And that's not just vaccine diagnostics, too.

436
01:02:13,250 --> 01:02:19,130
Like some people treatment for hepatitis B I remember or early on you have loose

437
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:30,079
Eliza has kids for checking hepatitis B surface and then several years later,

438
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:34,250
the technology developed more sensitive for the supportive people.

439
01:02:34,940 --> 01:02:43,310
I remember I was not vaccinated, so I was in the quality control department and we were asked to use some needs,

440
01:02:44,330 --> 01:02:51,710
stored a batch of old products and by new methodology.

441
01:02:51,860 --> 01:03:03,250
Of course, as you couldn't expect, the just there were some batch that's had a questionable result.

442
01:03:03,650 --> 01:03:07,870
So this is important. Yeah.

443
01:03:08,810 --> 01:03:12,370
However, this is very challenging task.

444
01:03:12,370 --> 01:03:16,750
Good because the increasing number of new products and the to people everything

445
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:23,900
that you know to the standards sometimes is a challenge for manufacturing.

446
01:03:24,290 --> 01:03:28,310
And also the quality concerns can be very complex.

447
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:37,850
As I say that the when you just think about the safety today, we have the population change.

448
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:44,000
We have an increased number of immunocompromised population.

449
01:03:44,390 --> 01:03:50,330
So this could potentially also pose some challenges to quantity.

450
01:03:52,750 --> 01:04:00,070
Come. How to control the quantity, especially safety and potency,

451
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:08,620
when you use those bags and the new technology issues arising from like the scientific advance.

452
01:04:09,100 --> 01:04:13,440
Yeah. Vector vaccine one time was very promising.

453
01:04:13,450 --> 01:04:25,330
Very is very mobile. But now with the COVID 19 vaccine experience, you know, some company would develop an app to make the vaccine,

454
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:36,640
which you apparently have not been as fast as this in a and in practice also or probably not to do the same.

455
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:42,670
So typically to establish or to identify and to consolidate the current some consensus

456
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:51,909
opinions on key regulatory issues and buy guidance for actors and many countries.

457
01:04:51,910 --> 01:04:54,970
I wouldn't say that's the message of every country,

458
01:04:55,270 --> 01:05:06,610
but many countries still hold very high regard to temperature, and some may choose their own standard.

459
01:05:06,610 --> 01:05:17,379
But virtual does provide the standard protocol for many products vaccine preventable disease vaccines.

460
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:25,270
And I know many developing countries use their standard and the W HL norms and standards.

461
01:05:25,270 --> 01:05:35,560
I already mentioned the the definition standards being to sense and this is an example for W.H.O.

462
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:40,830
You have a wise means of WTO specifications.

463
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:48,010
Another is actually reference sample as you show here.

464
01:05:49,030 --> 01:05:58,030
Usually it's developed with African biological program in collaboration with vaccine manufacturers across the world.

465
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:10,550
Yeah. For production and the quantity, W.H.O. has the standard or recommended the protocol for people to follow.

466
01:06:10,570 --> 01:06:17,290
But every country also has the freedom to develop their own regulations.

467
01:06:18,910 --> 01:06:25,180
I remember, for example, the BCG is alive in old time.

468
01:06:25,180 --> 01:06:30,040
Every manufacture, just the continued, the in person, the generation.

469
01:06:30,070 --> 01:06:42,220
At one point WTO made the recommendation in order to maintain the biological property from the vaccine strength.

470
01:06:42,460 --> 01:06:48,820
You can't pass that for 15 generations or nine generation.

471
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:57,639
I don't remember specific, but basically it's a sense of some rules to follow and the in the US so you all

472
01:06:57,640 --> 01:07:05,540
know it's FDA Center for biological evaluation and research and they work with

473
01:07:05,540 --> 01:07:15,310
the manufacture of how this monitor we're talking about a the is role with accurate

474
01:07:15,730 --> 01:07:24,730
and so I will skip here for principle elements for new license of vaccine.

475
01:07:25,630 --> 01:07:34,840
Why is preparation of pre clinical materials approved for cancer testing animal models?

476
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:41,290
Basically, you were hyper consistent of several batches of whatever vaccine you are trying to develop

477
01:07:42,070 --> 01:07:51,660
and then submission of investigational new drug application testing for safety practices.

478
01:07:51,660 --> 01:07:56,110
So clinical and the further lung clinical trials, it depends.

479
01:07:56,440 --> 01:08:04,810
Sometimes it's in the clinical trial and then you found some issues, maybe dosing issue and safety issue,

480
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:16,149
you could concurrently go back to do some animal studies and then submission of all clinical and clinical and manufacture data to FDA.

481
01:08:16,150 --> 01:08:24,700
So it's ever said this through this investigational new drug application, basically,

482
01:08:25,180 --> 01:08:32,110
to answer your question and what's involved in the investigation, a new drug application,

483
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:40,750
you have to have a detailed description of the accurate reads virus vaccine and a ten year

484
01:08:41,350 --> 01:08:50,829
life attenuated or killed on the vaccine or implant description method of manufacture.

485
01:08:50,830 --> 01:08:57,790
You basically have to put. Why is this the protocol?

486
01:08:58,390 --> 01:09:07,700
After once the vaccine is licensed, you basically have to follow that protocol to make every batch of vaccines.

487
01:09:07,710 --> 01:09:13,620
So these were expensive and the quality control test for release.

488
01:09:14,270 --> 01:09:18,819
And what kind of quality control you did?

489
01:09:18,820 --> 01:09:21,910
I mention the quarter comes from the final product.

490
01:09:22,030 --> 01:09:27,400
The products were because and then the information about vaccine safety.

491
01:09:27,670 --> 01:09:31,920
Of course, you have all kind of information.

492
01:09:31,940 --> 01:09:35,430
You can have information from animal studies.

493
01:09:35,490 --> 01:09:38,950
You can have information from all of the vaccine trials.

494
01:09:38,980 --> 01:09:44,850
If you are developing a vaccine that's already licensed elsewhere,

495
01:09:44,860 --> 01:09:50,739
you could look at some of the information from there and the information about vaccine

496
01:09:50,740 --> 01:09:58,960
immunogenicity in animal testing and propose the clinical protocol for studies in humans.

497
01:09:58,990 --> 01:10:06,280
That's very important because that's where you are, risk management and your team.

498
01:10:07,150 --> 01:10:10,960
We were talking about what we do, clinical trials.

499
01:10:11,980 --> 01:10:17,350
So these are the new investigation and new drug application.

500
01:10:19,540 --> 01:10:30,790
And then you would once you get the clinical trials done, you were to submit your pilot license.

501
01:10:32,020 --> 01:10:39,220
Provides my practice to FDA review for me to tell more about that.

502
01:10:39,850 --> 01:10:44,950
And yeah, undergoes a pre-approval inspection.

503
01:10:45,610 --> 01:10:57,579
This is important. It's not just looking at new or some new to the talking that the FDA expert panel actually some will go to the manufacturers

504
01:10:57,580 --> 01:11:07,450
sites will look at if you have to these good manufacture final products of good quality do have a quality assurance in place.

505
01:11:07,690 --> 01:11:19,870
And so those things will be examined and how to establish a safety compile 616 preclinical data basically

506
01:11:19,870 --> 01:11:28,300
your animals or you can also compare preclinical testing of use of the vaccine in other countries.

507
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:40,240
And of course, you have to when you compare to other populations of Brazil, you have to know if with this huge population difference, it may not be.

508
01:11:41,170 --> 01:11:50,739
For example, if you are doing a Pandora's box, you'll compare a high immunocompromised, the population.

509
01:11:50,740 --> 01:11:54,980
There's a lot of immunocompromised that will not be relevant.

510
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:59,930
Right. It can be safe in the lung immunocompromised population.

511
01:11:59,950 --> 01:12:04,570
But if you have population HIV infections, that's not relevant.

512
01:12:04,930 --> 01:12:11,710
So have to take will undertake new preclinical studies to provide necessary.

513
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:24,790
Data to support that. And you using a question about the manufacturing development process where we are.

514
01:12:24,820 --> 01:12:39,520
This is not good times, but I hope you can pay attention to that flow chart and then understand what may be involved in each step.

515
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:46,180
That would be good. But the major focus, of course, is terminology and importance.

516
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:54,320
And also the stages of development are important to you.

517
01:12:54,370 --> 01:13:09,550
If you are not a PII four times and may not be and expect you to remember what all the information is in this application.

518
01:13:09,910 --> 01:13:13,590
But you do want to know all those things and.

519
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:19,430
Wade picks the last few slides is more informational.

520
01:13:20,120 --> 01:13:26,060
Basically, I introduce you to a talk up of funding source government.

521
01:13:26,420 --> 01:13:38,780
Typically every country has some from US governments and not just support the US as the support some development in developing countries.

522
01:13:38,910 --> 01:13:49,160
If it's not a direct vaccine development, but doesn't support a lot of the work in the early stages like understand pathogenesis of HIV,

523
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:56,900
understand the pathogenesis of the disease, which is the foundation epidemiology studies,

524
01:13:57,020 --> 01:14:04,040
which is also important for vaccine development and the profits from sales of products.

525
01:14:04,430 --> 01:14:11,570
This is typically coming from the vaccine industry, but sometimes we'll have vaccine developed for for so long,

526
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:22,820
not getting to the next step will they may also transfer their approval of the products of people who to others at the institution nonprofit

527
01:14:22,850 --> 01:14:36,260
and student like I know the BCG vaccine after hundreds of years use there was no new products to develop for the last five years.

528
01:14:36,590 --> 01:14:47,060
GSK actually was involved in developing the subunit packs, which was the first ones to fire.

529
01:14:47,990 --> 01:15:02,479
But somehow after 1012 years now, they were then transferred to another research institutes, which is not for profit.

530
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:11,960
This is infected. So this is not always guaranteed risk of capital that could be charitable foundations.

531
01:15:12,380 --> 01:15:18,530
And this is actually charitable foundations have played a major role.

532
01:15:18,860 --> 01:15:27,200
One of the big charitable foundations involved in vaccine development is you probably know.

533
01:15:30,380 --> 01:15:48,480
There was. The Vaccine Alliance, which is based on a lot of the charm of Bill Gates Foundation, is putting a lot of it.

534
01:15:48,590 --> 01:15:56,580
And this is that if you are interested and involved in the global house of vaccine immunization,

535
01:15:56,850 --> 01:16:03,660
you definitely want to know this global alliance of the vaccine and the human rights issue.

536
01:16:04,110 --> 01:16:13,890
This is an international organization which more than two decades ago, it's a global vaccine alliance,

537
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:24,420
bringing together public and private sectors with the shared goal of creating you, access to you, and how to use the vaccine.

538
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:37,860
Despite we have so many well-proven, effective vaccines for vaccine preventable disease prevention,

539
01:16:38,280 --> 01:16:50,280
it's not for every country ever nation that urgently needs this vaccine have access to vaccines.

540
01:16:50,370 --> 01:17:00,210
So Gavin's goal is really to, you know, feel those gaps by providing some early funding support.

541
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:11,530
When you do the global immunization program presentation, you will get exposed to a lot of information that you were not aware of.

542
01:17:12,930 --> 01:17:18,210
So this is what's involved in the capital funding as you can.

543
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:31,830
Yeah, you could potentially join some of these organizations if you are interested in doing some work around vaccine utilization.

544
01:17:32,190 --> 01:17:37,890
So basically the awareness provides some this is the how that works.

545
01:17:38,190 --> 01:17:42,840
It's more information. No memorization is needed.

546
01:17:43,020 --> 01:17:47,820
They provide the seed funding with one major challenges.

547
01:17:48,570 --> 01:17:57,130
With this are setting seed funding. They may launch immunization program, but it's always a major challenge.

548
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:03,629
What happens after the five years or whatever year they gather.

549
01:18:03,630 --> 01:18:11,240
Approved ways to effective vaccine from a population that has some benefits would not be

550
01:18:11,250 --> 01:18:18,750
is right but the how you can see that this is a lot of public health research policy.

551
01:18:20,310 --> 01:18:30,300
Yeah what a support is new and underused the immunization service, health systems strengthening.

552
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:37,170
We will talk more about the health system's role in vaccine program results, the health system.

553
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:45,680
We've come to assess the success of the vaccine, no diseases surveillance, how you are going to make the future recommendations.

554
01:18:46,260 --> 01:18:54,180
So then the last organization is the developing country vaccine manufacturing network.

555
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:59,820
They all work, you know, following the VIRTUS Protocol.

556
01:19:00,330 --> 01:19:11,690
