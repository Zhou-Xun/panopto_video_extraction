1
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:04,500
Right? Yeah.

2
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,210
Okay. Cool and cool. All right.

3
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:20,940
I feel like it's now the first day of school, so I'm.

4
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:24,720
I'm happy to talk and ask if people are having a hard time hearing.

5
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:32,879
Let me know. And I can do a math. And if people are comfortable with it, they get to unmask for sure.

6
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,330
And next time or something. Because I know it's hard to.

7
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:44,580
Look at people in a mask all the time. And so welcome to our sort of cramped little space.

8
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:53,020
I'm glad that everybody made it. I have heard from some people who also have COVID and can't make it, so I think that'll just be the deal.

9
00:00:53,040 --> 00:01:02,009
I just set up the little Panopto to record, and so that's what I did last time and it seemed to work.

10
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:10,650
Okay, but let me know if you guys prefer Zoom and we'll see just what works the best.

11
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:15,570
So I'm happy to see all of you guys in person finally.

12
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:23,850
Yes. And thank you again for hanging in there on Zoom and with many lectures and everything.

13
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:31,020
I know it's like a lot of me on a screen, so we just organize this one site here.

14
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:40,589
So what I wanted to dove into today, it feels like a lot to dove into just in the first in-person class, but we will anyway.

15
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:45,660
And thank you also for like having discussions on the chat and everything because I think.

16
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:53,390
Like I said, I just get so much from hearing from you guys and everybody's experiences and comments in the class.

17
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:59,610
So today we're going to talk about theories and I kind of geek out on this.

18
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:04,270
Obviously from the video that I geek out on these, but just be forewarned.

19
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,680
But I think what's really cool and important is like,

20
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:14,920
how do we take these theories and actually apply them to be useful and promote positive child health and well-being?

21
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:23,739
So we'll go over the mediums and any questions and stuff from the mini lecture and then go

22
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:29,680
over some examples of how we do this and look at theory and apply it to public health.

23
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:36,799
And we'll look at the videos, so we'll review the videos in class and then put up links to those on campus.

24
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,630
So people may even already watch them, but if not, we'll watch them together.

25
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:48,009
And I think I said this already, but some of the images and things that I have and some of the slides,

26
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:55,090
if I repeat them in the mini lecture and then live, it's usually because I think they're important or I really love the images.

27
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:04,440
And then those kids, I really all so lucky in that. But this is sort of the point of why do we need to understand how development might unfold?

28
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:09,190
It's because we know that early development really does shape later life.

29
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:18,430
And if we understand kind of how it all happens, then we can figure out how to tweak it, for lack of a better word, in positive direction.

30
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:30,339
And so this is kind of the idea and I gave that that like nursery school dropouts article is one of those like kind of brief news blurbs.

31
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:33,270
That is a good summary of a lot of the issues that we talk about.

32
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:42,009
So again, that's something that like from a public health education utility, you could sort of, you know,

33
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:47,559
show people that article and say, you know, or some website that does a similar job to say that,

34
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:53,530
you know, we know that all of these big picture social determinants are impacting child health even from early on,

35
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:56,140
leading to this nursery school dropout phenomenon.

36
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:03,670
And what we want to do is figure out how to use theory to integrate that into our practice and prevent that.

37
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:14,559
So first, starting out with kind of where we are in the child developmental theory and I went over a lot of theories in the lecture,

38
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,090
but another thing to keep in mind is, of course, this isn't that right?

39
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:24,010
So theories and ways of thinking about developmental science is constantly evolving.

40
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:32,680
And so developmental sciences, people all probably know, started out with this like nature versus nurture debate,

41
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:39,430
which is increasingly as we learn more about epigenetics and biology and culture and everything else,

42
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,590
that's a little bit silly because of course it's not nature or nurture,

43
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:50,200
but it's helpful to start there because people kind of got into these sort of ways of

44
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:54,250
thinking about really how to shape child development and where they could shape it.

45
00:04:55,150 --> 00:05:04,810
So this idea of the tabula rasa or the blank slate was that like a child comes into the world and has nothing.

46
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:09,760
They're like a total blank slate that you can do anything to that child and tweak them in any way,

47
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,240
and they will become the way you want them to become.

48
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:23,889
So that was sort of one perspective of the total nurture perspective, the other perspective of the total nature perspective.

49
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:28,810
And so that's that idea of people have innate abilities and they're born with everything.

50
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:33,070
They have that like seed into the plants idea.

51
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:36,790
And that's sort of where a lot of them aspirational theories kind of start.

52
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:41,800
I said, the more we learn about sort of genetics and epigenetics,

53
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:50,140
epigenetics for people who are not familiar are basically things that happen in life that can shape genetic expression.

54
00:05:50,890 --> 00:06:00,340
And so as we learn about that, that really kind of pinpoints this like nature, nurture, interplay in a really cool way.

55
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:06,820
And we'll talk about in a few weeks to when we talk more about environmental health,

56
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:14,590
there are things that we are identifying that impact genetics in a very specific way that exist in the environment.

57
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:20,020
So really there is no nature nurture, but starting there is kind of how it all starts.

58
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:29,950
I also talked about relationship focus theories and that idea of kind of again the word psychodynamic.

59
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:36,490
That's a really that's probably appropriately like bad reputation because people think,

60
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:41,590
you know, Freud is the person who sort of most associated with that theory.

61
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:51,339
But I would argue we actually do continue to know that we are shaped by sort of our internal psychological structures,

62
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:54,370
and those do drive our behavior and all of that stuff around,

63
00:06:54,910 --> 00:07:03,550
you know, what did your mother do to you and have Freud as sort of mocked in that way, at least in psychology, in literature, people still love Freud.

64
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,350
So it's interesting.

65
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:15,160
But we do we do have motivations for our behavior that really are shaped by those sort of dynamics that developed early in our childhood.

66
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:23,680
And then recently I'll talk about this more, but there has been more of a focus on relational health in early childhood,

67
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:29,050
and that really stems from some of these theories, attachment theory in particular.

68
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:32,079
But we'll talk more about relational health.

69
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:38,620
But it's it's gaining traction, which is sort of exciting to think about as a childhood development person,

70
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:44,770
because we know that these early relationships are really foundational for children,

71
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:48,729
and some people have always sort of focused on that, but not everyone.

72
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:56,800
And now it's becoming much more broadly with the ACS literature to talk more about that, but it's more broadly appreciated.

73
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:06,130
Okay. And then another kind of group of theories I did talk about was this these theories that kind of focus,

74
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:09,850
they're sort of less developed than developmental in some ways,

75
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:15,160
but they're more about like the process of how development occurs and how learning occurs.

76
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:20,330
And so learning theory, if people know. Yes.

77
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:28,510
This whole story about how he raised his child in a box to sort of enable to test what he could make the child learn how to do it.

78
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,790
He just reinforced different behaviors differently.

79
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:40,690
If people are familiar with some some actual interventions that happened today, like some sort of autism spectrum interventions like behavior change,

80
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:48,520
interventions that are very focused on reinforcement behavior that's actually emanating from these very early learning theories.

81
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:55,989
They become more complex as we understand, like people learn in different ways and people change their behavior in different ways.

82
00:08:55,990 --> 00:09:02,200
And different processes underlie lots of different behaviors, kind of depending on the complexity of the behavior you're looking at.

83
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:10,210
So these are important and lots of intervention implications because we think about behavior change

84
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:16,410
is really often trying to have people learn to do different things or start to do different things.

85
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,940
And so how do we understand how that happens?

86
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:27,489
And then finally, something we think a lot about in public health is this idea of environmental influence and social contextual models.

87
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:32,440
Right. And I put bio in social ecological because I think that's really critical.

88
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,260
And especially the sort of the younger kids you're talking about,

89
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:42,580
the more biology is like on display because currently they don't have sort of the layers of like

90
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:48,700
socialization that we all have to sort of hide what's just out there in terms of their biology.

91
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:52,660
So that's always really important, though. Okay.

92
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,540
So just to sort of show there's change over time.

93
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:10,630
Did anyone have a favorite theory in the mini lecture or and or a more of a theory that they thought, you know, isn't helpful and also related?

94
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:19,570
Any theory that sort of seemed to speak to issues that you care about and child health and public health.

95
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:24,840
Anything that made you go, oh, maybe that could relate to the way that I think about these things.

96
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:29,200
Interventions I've worked with, and that's kind of an odd question.

97
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:50,320
I will take sips of water just talking to me, but I'm sure I know the theory was interesting, but it was also kind of like abrupt in like.

98
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,990
But looking at my development so far.

99
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:03,360
Right, right, right. Some of it. And this is the one Erickson theory, which is like across the lifespan.

100
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:09,890
So there's like big stages of life which would still kind of match in many ways, right?

101
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:15,940
Like you sort of I feel like sometimes when I read about this stuff and I go, Oh, that kind of really got me.

102
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:19,450
I feel so like trite now or something, like, you know what I mean?

103
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:31,240
It's not that special, but if you think about it, these are really kind of core key called developmental conflicts that kind of characterize stages.

104
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,040
Of development. At the same time, I would say, like it's a little bit like.

105
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:46,910
You know, it's it's very generalized. Right. It's not going to apply to every single person all the time and people are going to move back and forth.

106
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:52,729
So those stage theories, I think they can be really helpful when you're also really focused in on like,

107
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:56,660
oh, my gosh, I'm going to work with seventh graders. What are seventh graders about?

108
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:00,020
And that's kind of a tricky example because they are like all over the map.

109
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:05,900
But, you know, if I'm working with preschoolers, what what are they kind of able to do at this point?

110
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:13,670
So it's helpful to kind of like orient you to a given stage or age range and think about what would be relevant for this point.

111
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:19,399
These kids, this age or people. I found the social learning theory interesting,

112
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:26,430
and it reminded me of the video that Tiger Woods and his son like how they have some of the same mannerisms.

113
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:30,950
Yes. It's literally like are you even if you don't realize it?

114
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:34,270
Yes. And that is so powerful. Right.

115
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:38,030
I'm sorry. I'm trying to see. Okay. I know. Yes, that's good.

116
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:41,570
Yeah. Maybe we can say our names to to, like, get our get ourselves or.

117
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:47,100
But, yeah, absolutely. I love those examples. And they pop up all the time.

118
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,159
And you don't realize necessarily like, ooh, that's happening.

119
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,770
And that social learning theory in action. You can see those examples accurately.

120
00:12:55,310 --> 00:13:02,120
Yeah, I also found the stage theory interesting. I kind of wondered how like just moving through stages,

121
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:09,210
but how the impacts of like childhood trauma or not having like parental support and certainty,

122
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:15,170
like we're just like caregiver support at certain key moments in development.

123
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:19,790
Done a child's like progression. Mm hmm.

124
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:24,829
Or, like, freeze them in time. Absolutely right.

125
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:28,700
So the stage theory is like, you're sort of people talking stage theories to this.

126
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:32,570
Like, it's an abrupt shift, but it's really like we'll talk about with motor development.

127
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:36,830
Like you can actually see these threads of like how the shift is sort of starting.

128
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:43,850
But like you said, if you sort of miss out on a key developmental influences influence for that stage,

129
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:53,810
it can kind of hamper your development in later stages because this idea that you sort of reorganize and you're in this new stage and then you kind

130
00:13:53,810 --> 00:14:03,640
of reach to the next one and we will talk about kind of that idea because it has so much to do with when do we do interventions and for whom,

131
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:09,950
right? So which kids would we be doing interventions with parenting interventions versus like

132
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:16,279
peer focused interventions and how that works and understanding what someone's history is.

133
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,430
Back to the psychodynamic idea.

134
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:26,420
What's your history of your having parented quote unquote in a certain way, and how would that impact your later stages for sure?

135
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:33,890
Yeah. Yeah. I was also interested in the mistake I work with.

136
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:41,569
It's interesting to see like if they do that based on ages because like I could work maybe like 16,

137
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:51,709
but like their age date is like it might be like younger than like you would think that their age you like working with that is kind

138
00:14:51,710 --> 00:15:00,740
of interesting I have to disagree with you would assume that a specific state like they just aren't at that stage at that age.

139
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:04,390
Yeah. Yes. And actually that's a really good point, too.

140
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:10,520
We'll talk more about when we get in infancy. We'll talk about these different domains of development because this is sort of saying

141
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:14,659
you're at a stage across your entire development set like you just brought up.

142
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:20,870
You might have one area of development like your cognition or your motor behavior that's in a different stage.

143
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:27,979
And that kind of mismatch across age and and kind of capacity or developmental

144
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:33,410
abilities can really be sort of jarring and kind of be a challenge for both,

145
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:38,209
you know, the person and then the person, the people that that person is interacting with in their social context.

146
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:44,710
So yeah, great point. Jackie. Yeah. So the issue I was thinking about was like, forget it.

147
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,310
So issue, but just nutrition and eating behavior.

148
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:55,940
And for me it was like I looked at all those series and like all this curious pacifier, like maternal maturation.

149
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:59,599
I don't know how it was pronounced correctly. I like thinking about food.

150
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,440
It's like you for energy intake, like literally needing it to, like, grow and then, like stay serious.

151
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:08,900
Thinking about how eating behaviors may be changed in different stages,

152
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:15,350
but then also like kind of social contextual theories and learning theories about learning like it's eating like a social

153
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:23,060
thing and like a lot of the behaviors and what you eat is influenced by those around and also even like the environment.

154
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:29,060
So for me, I was like, I have to separate one theory or one topic.

155
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,610
Yeah. And that's a really good point.

156
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:38,720
And that like that you just sort of clicked through all these, these relevance for the eating domain kind of eating behavior domain and.

157
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:44,040
It's also true, like all of these are operational and everybody, right?

158
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:52,470
Like if one child has maturation and they have stages and they learn in certain ways and they have relationships and they live in a social context.

159
00:16:53,040 --> 00:17:00,390
So kind of depending on what window you want to take and it's hard to address them all,

160
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:07,350
but we also want to address them also like, you know, I always think like from this whole child perspective,

161
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:11,819
they're sitting there and they have I'll say this again when I talk about domains, but they have cognition,

162
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:15,840
they have social behavior, they have emotions, they have appetites and that kind of thing.

163
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:20,129
So they're not choked up separately. So that's a really good point as well.

164
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:28,140
And then I'm like, Yeah, I thought that the learning theories were really interesting when I was working in elementary schools and our

165
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:36,719
children had autism and they specifically like have their own sticker charts that we were able to use for like,

166
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:41,010
oh, my goodness. Like that's that's like specific rewarding behavior.

167
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:52,710
Yes. Yes. And when we talk about this comes up a lot in like parenting behavior, programing and lots of different behavior change things.

168
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:57,810
It's really important to think about these in terms of what are the rewards going to

169
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:03,450
be and how to sort of tailor that to the child and then also build in this awareness.

170
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:11,309
Look at the Tiger Woods picture like, hey, this is happening here and this child is learning from my behavior, even if it's unintentional.

171
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:18,780
So an example you hear a lot is like when you give sort of attention to like bad behaviors or behaviors you don't want to see,

172
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:22,910
you're actually rewarding those behaviors and making it more likely to be happening.

173
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:27,690
So we'll talk more about that. But that's certainly central to learning theory.

174
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:35,220
Absolutely. Yeah. Well, what if a child is like, oh, you're not sure anything?

175
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:42,150
Oh, if you're trying to figure out a reward, that's, like, better than screentime.

176
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:51,330
Yeah, it's that's a huge challenge. And that's when you have to get kind of creative about figuring out what's going to work for that child.

177
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:57,790
If you're talking about working with an individual child or for that parent child dyad in your school settings,

178
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:05,219
it can be really hard because especially if you have a child who's just behaviors out of control,

179
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:11,040
for example, and it's hard to what we always say is like, ignore the bad behavior,

180
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:14,850
ignore the behavior you don't want to see and reward the behavior you do want to see.

181
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:19,680
But what if you don't see any behavior in this kid that you want to see more of?

182
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:25,920
You have to be really, really thoughtful. And we'll talk more about this, too, for sure, with parenting interventions in infancy.

183
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:34,100
You have to look you have to be able to pluck out a moment of like, oh, right there, that was a, you know, do more of that, you know.

184
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:38,750
But that can be really hard, especially if you're talking about kids who are like in distress,

185
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,780
having trouble, parent, child dyads, who are really struggling.

186
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:50,860
And so that's something that. You know, kind of comes with practice and with getting to know your population really well for your child.

187
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:58,030
Absolutely. So, yeah, so I love it.

188
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:05,230
And, you know, it's funny, I always say child health issue and it's kind of like any child health topic I see.

189
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:13,810
Is that super friendly? Okay. So talking about in the readings that chapter from that self-help book,

190
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:25,060
they talked about a few different things and also kind of is really as applied to this, you know, public health kind of set of topics.

191
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:30,940
And I think you can probably see like this developmental origins of health and disease.

192
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:39,540
I was just talking about epigenetics a little bit, and that's one mechanism by which what we call fetal programing can happen.

193
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:49,810
So like what's happening in the in the pregnancy, that's like just stating this organism will have an impact on sort of.

194
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:56,380
That that organism from the very beginning. And again, that's like.

195
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:04,040
Kind of combining that nature and nurture perspective because it's sort of saying nurture.

196
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:11,780
So the prenatal environment, what the prenatal environment is like is really shaping that organism from the germination,

197
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:21,530
and then that organism is its own biology. So from the beginning it's its own nature, but it's already been shaped by prenatal environment.

198
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:28,780
And then we also know prenatal environment is shaped by external environment, by maternal grandmother environment.

199
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:32,600
So it's like so, so deep and complicated.

200
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:40,759
And the other thing to think to know about this is sort of something we talk about a lot in public health and a lot

201
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:47,840
of the environmental kind of toxicant research is really focused in this area on looking at prenatal exposures.

202
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:53,750
And so if people are interested in that and there's great research that's happening here at U of M in that area,

203
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:59,450
the other thing here that I think is really important to point out for intervention is that

204
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:04,850
that difference between sensitive and critical periods and they went through some examples,

205
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:11,060
but a critical period is much less common than a sensitive period.

206
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:21,620
A critical period is like very rigid, saying like if you're not exposed to X in this sort of very tight developmental window,

207
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:26,090
you will not develop it like period done like you can't get it.

208
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:32,990
And there are very few things in human development that are like that, mostly in human development.

209
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:38,900
We're talking about sensitive periods, but meaning like in infancy,

210
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:48,800
that relational health with the primary caregiver is critically important, critically sensitive, and that's a sensitive period of infancy.

211
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:55,070
Those terms are sort of used sometimes by people not in the field interchangeably.

212
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:58,670
So that's just in terms of the mind. And there's research, for example,

213
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:07,190
like critical periods with like kittens who are born not able to see and if they have to get light exposure of certain point,

214
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:13,460
otherwise they will be blind. So that's like a real critical period with a hard edge versus a sensitive period.

215
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:20,210
And what we think in terms of intervention is like if you do the intervention in a sensitive period,

216
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:25,130
hopefully you'll get more bang for the buck because you'll shape development at this sensitive time.

217
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:33,080
It's not to say that you can't do intervention later or at another time, but it may be most powerful in the sense of period.

218
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,759
The other is kind of big theory that's really public health.

219
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:44,690
Relevance they talked about was a life course health development and that really is a life span theory also.

220
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:49,790
So it's kind of like the Erikson stages in that it's life span, but it is front loaded,

221
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:54,200
meaning that like more is sort of happening in the early stages of development.

222
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:02,570
We'll talk more about intergenerational effects, but that's that idea of like what your parents experienced.

223
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:09,530
And we'll talk about like parents who have experienced trauma or aces themselves, how that plays into their parenting.

224
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:15,010
What did people think about that? Stress exposures.

225
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:22,450
Discussion. Any thoughts on characterizing the stress exposures?

226
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:24,580
How they how they characterize them?

227
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:33,700
I guess I would then we'll talk a lot more about stress in adversity and ACS and this is sort of my first internal.

228
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:38,880
Yeah. I thought it was interesting how they were talking about it.

229
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:43,070
Like in a state, like in stages of severity.

230
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:47,630
Like, oh, I'm like a toddler. And I fall down like.

231
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:54,270
Like you're fine versus like having, like, an experience or more physical part.

232
00:24:54,840 --> 00:25:00,050
It would be a more extreme version of different effects on the food.

233
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:09,049
Right? So some of it is maybe inoculating was kind of like to say inoculating in sort of positive stress because it was sort of.

234
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:12,770
Javi But but yeah, there's this range, right?

235
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:19,339
Yeah. Jackie Yeah, that's fine. I mean, I'm super interested in and understanding stress and like especially chronic stress

236
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:24,979
and behaviors and then also diving into like the what actually happens to your body,

237
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:32,360
like continuous rays, cortisol, like rays information and how does that develop then like developed principally in the brain?

238
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:40,099
And how does that that affects like later in life when you have chronic stress as a child and as adults?

239
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:45,740
You know, we will talk a lot more about that as well.

240
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:50,000
And that's a lot of that resilience film to delve into that, too.

241
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:54,560
And full disclosure, I do research in that area, so I'm like, Yeah, right.

242
00:25:55,970 --> 00:26:03,320
So yeah. Any other thoughts on that sort of stresses, adversity, discussion or other things from that chapter?

243
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:13,110
Notice I always put that note here about food allergies because speaking of like theories and science and health,

244
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:22,159
public health and those changing, we've really seen a big shift in the food allergy literature and science over the past few years.

245
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:30,500
So and I would say, like, we still don't really know what to do with with early food allergies.

246
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:37,130
But now the recommendations, for example, are to give kids who, you know,

247
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:43,890
foods that we would have maybe avoided like nuts in the past few decades or decade, three decades.

248
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:50,840
Now, the advice is actually expose them earlier to those potential allergens and catch them carefully,

249
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,600
especially if there's a family history, but do that exposure earlier.

250
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:59,150
So that's that inoculation idea in that very specific kind of food allergy context.

251
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:06,889
So that other article I love this article.

252
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:17,840
I know it's super dense, but one reason I love it is that it really lays out and I like it also because it's global health and it's sort of

253
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:25,670
like addressing health really broadly from such a thing about this sustainable development and millennium goals.

254
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:40,980
There are so many different things we can do and thinking about how we can do things to promote child development that are not cost free,

255
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:50,879
like nothing is cost free. But they're sort of in the range of things that people might do in their life anyway.

256
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:58,320
And they can make a really big difference in child development if you kind of shift your thinking about how important they.

257
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:10,049
So that sort of I think I have explained that of all people with this, I'll talk more about this at the end.

258
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:16,080
But like this table at the very end of this article where it sort of goes through the life span and it's talking about like,

259
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:24,390
here's all the different kinds of interventions. We could do it all these different ages, you know, and I know some aspects I can't actually read,

260
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:32,250
but it sort of just goes through different times of life. So pregnancy, labor and birth, neonatal infancy, early childhood.

261
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:39,120
And you'll notice they're passing this early development much more tightly than I am in this course.

262
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:43,170
But there are certainly different things that you do in the first trimester of

263
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:46,809
pregnancy versus the third trimester of pregnancy versus neonatal versus infants.

264
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:52,780
So that idea of just chunking up really carefully what developmental stage you're talking about and what to do.

265
00:28:53,530 --> 00:29:01,859
That's probably why I love this article and because the recommended because it's a group of researchers who are

266
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:08,610
working in a global context that are sometimes really not very well resourced in terms of money and therapists.

267
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:13,230
And we've talked about lack of access to mental health care the other day.

268
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,469
I think it's always important to keep in mind,

269
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:26,490
like what's optimal and what's possible and what's appropriate and fitting to your context and acceptable to your population.

270
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:30,150
So I think that article is a nice one that kind of touches on all of that.

271
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:36,580
Any questions or comments on that article will kind of go back to it in the future?

272
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:42,600
It's a good background one, I think.

273
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:51,360
I think we've talked a little bit about this, but just thinking about the kinds of interventions.

274
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,750
So this one talks a lot about nurturing care interventions.

275
00:29:55,800 --> 00:30:01,140
What kind of theories do you think that is based on thinking about the kinds of different,

276
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:07,020
different theories we're reviewing and thinking about a nurturing care intervention.

277
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:18,280
I love it. It's like as close as I get to a pop quiz. I really got an idea.

278
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:31,680
What? Like thinking about nurturing care interventions?

279
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:47,700
What theories are based on what would you like something very and positive reinforcement for others that could be nurturing care instructions.

280
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:53,309
Yeah, that's, that's a good frame because that's not the one I think about.

281
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:57,290
But it's totally relevant because of what I was talking about earlier,

282
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:03,270
like this idea of catching a behavior that you want to see more as you're doing a nurturing care intervention.

283
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:11,370
That could be a technique that you used in from social learning to say, Oh, here I've got this mom baby situation.

284
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:17,940
Let me help the mom catch the behaviors that she wants to see more and more positively toward that.

285
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:21,990
Yeah, let's see. Emily And then attachment.

286
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:29,730
Attachment. That's the one that I would send is that they're going to say, Oh, I was just thinking about, like, schools.

287
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:33,030
Why do they have detention? Like, you know.

288
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:40,340
Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's true. I mean, yes, yes.

289
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:43,950
Wait, something. No, no, no. I'm like, that's a good topic.

290
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:49,380
But yeah, attachment theory is sort of like central to those nurturing care interventions

291
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:53,639
and that relationship that early relationships between mother and baby.

292
00:31:53,640 --> 00:32:03,540
So just as an example, we will totally talk more about, I would call it like punitive disciplinary practices in school detention being one.

293
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:09,330
And certainly we'll talk more about that in lots of sessions.

294
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:18,420
But absolutely, that's a negative and negative reinforcement reinforcer in a way.

295
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:26,340
But it's not something that we want to do because it is positive and there's lots of other reasons we can talk about.

296
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:32,100
So we'll maybe put a hold on that discussion now, but we'll come back to it.

297
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:41,940
Okay. Let me let me move to just this example, thinking about maturation and environment.

298
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:49,860
So we have this infant walking. I know I show this in the lecture and what I wanted to I don't know if you guys have as pointed stuff,

299
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:55,620
but what's really important for this is just to sort of show like.

300
00:32:56,860 --> 00:33:06,160
At this very early age. So 0 to 1 month old, they're doing motor behavior and really important motor skill that they get as they lifted their head.

301
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:11,740
And they're just when they're born, they're like a little blob and they don't know what it's like to control that.

302
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:20,290
And so when they do that, huge I mean, think about as you guys are familiar with the Back to Sleep campaign.

303
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:30,489
That's partly why, because babies who are really little can't lift their head when you put a mask on a baby who is under one month old.

304
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:36,040
Right. Because they can't lift their head away from like soft bedding or something that might suffocate them.

305
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:41,740
So you put them on their back and because they can't yet roll over, they're sort of stuck there on the deck.

306
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:47,180
Once babies do start to roll over, this is like parenting stuff, right?

307
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:51,739
So we might have a new parent and they're going, These are great.

308
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:55,730
All these motor milestones my kid is doing. But like, oh, like it's driving me crazy like that.

309
00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:00,530
They can go off the bed, they can now fall down stairs. They used to just be this little blob that I could contain.

310
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:08,150
And all of these things are happening. And so from this kind of parenting, like safe child safety side, which we'll talk about more,

311
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:16,250
there's a lot here to think about with motor development that can really impact family life.

312
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:23,809
So that's another thing to note. And then I mentioned like the sort of width of these red lines indicate individual differences.

313
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:29,299
So this is like a micro stage theory in a way, right?

314
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:35,270
So here, like the infant is going through all these different stages, they all look really different.

315
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:41,839
And this is not that much. I was highlight this because this is not that much like person time like from 0 to 5 months.

316
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:45,739
But in the life of an infant, they go from this little blob to a sitting creature,

317
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:49,970
which is like massively different in terms of how they interact with the world.

318
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:53,510
And so that's important to know these stages.

319
00:34:53,960 --> 00:35:01,520
But also there's a wide individual variation when kids do this and some kids and I don't know if anybody has like personal knowledge of this,

320
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:08,240
but like sometimes just totally skip crawling or they'll skip some of these other stages, like they won't pulled himself up.

321
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:12,349
Sometimes you see this some like younger siblings because they have so many models

322
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:16,400
of like kids who are walking like little people walking around them all the time,

323
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:20,710
but they just sort of watch. And then one day they're like, okay, I'm on.

324
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:25,370
And then they start to walk and they never called. And parents like, I thought I had a little more time, you know?

325
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:28,280
So all of these things are pretty flexible.

326
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:37,760
But I like this graph because it sort of really shows like these are all very different motions that we do without thinking about it necessarily.

327
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:44,720
But for an infant, those are like qualitative shifts. Okay, so let me see.

328
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,160
I see a little play here.

329
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:57,169
This is this baby walking video that the woman whose lab this is, which she's a motor developmental list and she's actually like a systems researcher.

330
00:35:57,170 --> 00:36:03,860
So she thinks about all the different things that impact motor development and lots of different, really fascinating work.

331
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:06,889
But I want to go through this. Well, here, hold on.

332
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:10,430
I'll just do it in in much more calm. Sorry.

333
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:12,730
This is going to be lab essays that I want,

334
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:21,530
but maybe just we'll take a look at the infant walking around a little bit and just notice, see what you notice on Thursdays.

335
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:27,740
But now I'm writing short. Okay, now, Skip. There's some sounds in here, but not tends.

336
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:50,910
That's just all the instrumented equipment. So she's, like, getting data on brainwaves and heart rate.

337
00:36:58,330 --> 00:37:03,340
Okay. So right there. Did you guys notice anything about where the infant was crawling?

338
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:09,530
Yeah. I'm having a lot of trouble with that checkerboard.

339
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:14,540
Like, oh, they're like, what is this thing?

340
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:23,570
Right. And can you imagine? Like, if an infant infant if in an infant's room that was like the main rug, that might not face them.

341
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:29,660
Right. It's kind of they're part of their experience. They may not have seen this funky goalkeeping before.

342
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:37,519
Oops, oops. I love how they're holding this little thing.

343
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:46,800
It's like they're holding on to something. We're pretty early, Walker.

344
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:59,150
That's a big problem solved right there. Well, I think it went okay.

345
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:03,090
Come to think of it, there actually is. I'm not a family doctor.

346
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:07,070
Okay. Yeah. So let's see. What else?

347
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:11,570
What else did you guys notice there? The problem solving about the.

348
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:16,580
The step. Yeah. Different.

349
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:20,830
Like what you like. She was like nothing on it. Seemed like she actually knew.

350
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:24,250
Yeah, yeah, totally. I think she was like, is this solid, you know?

351
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:28,360
And for those of you who maybe have taken, like developmental psychology classes and stuff,

352
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:37,120
there's this classic experiment called the visual collapse. What I like about that is that it's a great social referencing experiment.

353
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:48,130
So basically what they do is they put this, you know, it's like low and they put a solid, very solid like plexiglass panel over this visual cliff.

354
00:38:49,630 --> 00:39:00,950
And then they have babies. Free walkers, almost walkers post walkers try to their crawlers and they encourage them to cross that cliff.

355
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:06,710
And what's really cool is that, I mean, there's lots of different things about that experience being used many, many times.

356
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:13,910
But what's really cool, I think, is that if you put the parent or the primary caregiver on the other side of the cliff, and they do.

357
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:20,960
I'll take my notes. If they make an expression like, you know, like that the infant won't cross the cliff, typically.

358
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:25,310
But if they're like you, you know that you can do anything. An infant will cross the cliff.

359
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:31,790
But what also matters is whether the infant can easily crawl, whether they've had experience.

360
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:39,740
Like she tapped that step and she was like, okay, this is in my experience, I know how I can, like, get up on that step.

361
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:44,620
And if infants have not ever seen a stuff like that or been expected to cross it,

362
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:50,360
look at their pre crawlers, they might not have that alarm at seeing the visual cleft.

363
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:56,179
So they're like manipulated this experience lots of different right. So but I love the social referencing part of it,

364
00:39:56,180 --> 00:40:06,680
which is that parent signaling and social referencing is like a core infancy construct that relates to so many things in life, I think.

365
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:11,060
So it's a good one to keep in mind. Okay.

366
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:16,640
The other thing here is like one of my favorite study names is go naked.

367
00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:19,220
Diapers affect infant walking.

368
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:29,820
What they showed and again, this is from the same lab and they have these like instrumented mats where they can tell you the type of date a child has.

369
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:39,500
And so what do you guys notice there about? What the infant has on and the kinds of footprints they're making on this maps.

370
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:51,730
Yeah, swaddling or with the cloth of that disposable diaper, they can take their steps a lot closer together with their naked.

371
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:58,690
Yeah, absolutely. It's really kind of clear right there, a sort of like y y which we can all picture, right?

372
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:03,360
Like that's how the issue is diaper on, you know.

373
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:10,240
And so if you think about it like this, walking is a really maturation driven like pretty hard wired skill.

374
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:18,790
But these things that we do in kind of everyday life can sort of shift how that looks like kind of you'd say in a way the quality of the walking,

375
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:28,390
because if you think about it like a B, a naked baby can run a lot faster than a baby wearing a big diaper.

376
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:39,790
And so here also in terms of thinking about, okay, quality of motor development and feet and walking, they had this 13 month old baby.

377
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:47,890
So babies around, there's a really rough guy that's like walk at one talk, get to just kind of handy to keep in mind.

378
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:57,640
Many babies around 12 months will be walking. So they have these 13 month olds, the babies who didn't have the diaper on fell less awesome.

379
00:41:58,270 --> 00:42:06,009
So sort of easy for them to negotiate walking. And then the other thing that that makes me think about is that like, okay, well,

380
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:12,460
we dress babies in all kinds of different ways and, you know, disposable diapers are.

381
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:19,270
For the convenience of parents and to the sadness of the planet, they have become much,

382
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:22,720
much more frequently used and are basically new in the last 50 years.

383
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:31,840
So what does that mean in terms of how we're shaping walking, you know, and how we can think about,

384
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:38,290
you know, different kind of cultural practices around walking, the development of walking.

385
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:45,519
One of the things that also has been studied a lot is infants who are carried in a backpack.

386
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:53,110
And often this is in places where like the mom or the primary caregiver is working and the infant is carried front or back.

387
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:57,670
Those infants can often skip walking stages, but then they catch up.

388
00:42:58,090 --> 00:43:09,520
They catch up pretty reasonably. You can also have walking training and have earlier walkers, and they also kind of generally resolve.

389
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:14,680
So walking is a skill that there's some variation, but most people end up.

390
00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:19,620
If unless they're date difficulties, I'm walking pretty reasonably.

391
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:24,469
But you can see these early differences. And so I think I would encourage this in the movies,

392
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:29,540
see like different ways that kids are kind of carried walking, engaging in those kinds of behaviors.

393
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:36,590
So this is a pretty small manipulation that can shift that, a little bit of walking skill.

394
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:43,460
Okay. So like, for example, like if you're Tiger Woods and you really want your kids to be like an awesome athlete.

395
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:49,490
Like, maybe have no diapers, I don't know. So you could think about the implications of that.

396
00:43:50,730 --> 00:44:00,160
Okay. So this is another example that's super relevant for intervention and it's example of the stage from Piaget.

397
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:04,760
So I think I mentioned on the video that Piaget basically studied his own kids.

398
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:12,050
Not a representative sample is like 1930s Swiss, Geneva guy, psychologist.

399
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:18,860
All of these reasons why like, wow, we have a lot of information that we got from this one guy and it's like three kids.

400
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:24,020
But if you read the original like that in his notes,

401
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:30,870
basically he made these observations that were like day for 2 p.m. that the day

402
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:34,100
they do this and he does this for like all the it's like really exhaustive.

403
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:36,380
It's like a case study of these kids.

404
00:44:37,370 --> 00:44:43,589
And so people have certainly, again, critiqued Piaget because they're like, Oh, we underestimated these abilities.

405
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:52,520
He didn't think about this, but he did come up with these sort of like experiments or manipulations that really show us as adults,

406
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:56,569
like, oh wow, kids thinking is different in certain areas.

407
00:44:56,570 --> 00:45:00,770
And so you can shift these skills around, but we'll watch this one.

408
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:08,570
So do you think that they have the same amount of juice? So this is called conservation, real conservation skills.

409
00:45:09,350 --> 00:45:13,280
And you can you can see what she does and you can get the same.

410
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:17,240
Okay. Now we're going to pour this juice into this glass.

411
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:33,859
Now. Do you think that this class has more juice, this class has more juice, or do you think that they have the same amount that this guy has not?

412
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:37,460
And I do think that this man is taller.

413
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:43,850
Okay. So if I do that, then I ask which one has more read?

414
00:45:43,850 --> 00:45:48,409
Probably. I think I'll say like they have the same I think would be like a remnant of Jews,

415
00:45:48,410 --> 00:45:53,750
but like basically they have the same Jews and so it's called pre operational the stage

416
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:58,700
because operations do as a means basically like doing math in your head some ways.

417
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:01,609
So she's thinking about only one dimension.

418
00:46:01,610 --> 00:46:10,879
She's like cued in to like, oh, that got taller and she's not appreciating because she's pre operational that it also got narrower.

419
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:14,020
She just like is focusing on the most salient dimension.

420
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:18,919
Okay. Okay. So I think one more example. Okay.

421
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:23,530
You ready? Okay. Does this room has more quarters?

422
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:35,920
Does this have more quarters or do they have ac1 and the E three you might like to see?

423
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:45,300
In the same five five good strategy Rice accounted.

424
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:54,020
Okay. Does this rule have more followers? Does this rule have more?

425
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:58,380
Do they have the same features that one has to reporters?

426
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:09,990
Why is this real? Because you can I think, which is it's more far away.

427
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:13,810
You can see it.

428
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:29,790
Okay. So you kind of wonder like there's as you guys can imagine, a lot of people like what have we tried to teach these?

429
00:47:29,970 --> 00:47:34,030
You know what? If we have her again, like, would she then get to get the photos?

430
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:40,230
Since a lot of people have sort of shown that like you can do some teaching the like move kids along and they're thinking like this.

431
00:47:43,410 --> 00:47:49,830
What are you guys that when you watch that and you think about like intervention stuff that you might do with kids,

432
00:47:50,550 --> 00:47:58,440
why would it, you know, these she's probably like six ish that's around that age of a kind of pre operational speech.

433
00:47:59,430 --> 00:48:01,079
Think about what six year olds are doing.

434
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:09,200
So they're coming to kindergarten or maybe first grade or, you know, in any kind of like an eating intervention.

435
00:48:09,210 --> 00:48:16,410
What like when we talk about, you know, two kids that age and why might this be relevant to think about these sort of.

436
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:22,150
Understanding of quantity here. What's in front of you?

437
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:34,910
How changes? Focus on each parent who opposes the father immediately reminded me of your kids and siblings.

438
00:48:34,910 --> 00:48:38,809
When someone gets mad at someone who's more about like just about acting like

439
00:48:38,810 --> 00:48:42,200
they actually have the same mouth that they can't process as everyone does.

440
00:48:42,590 --> 00:48:50,300
So I think a simple intervention there was like everyone got the talk class versus give me different type

441
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:59,210
and made me think about design of a lot of things like size of plates and cups and stuff like that.

442
00:48:59,630 --> 00:49:05,360
Yeah, definitely design of things and that like like when I call it heading it off at the pass, right?

443
00:49:05,390 --> 00:49:09,620
Like if you're the caregiver who's dividing stuff by kids, you want to give,

444
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:18,000
like if you can like equal size cup or break things into two pieces or you know,

445
00:49:18,110 --> 00:49:23,060
the pieces are an equal for anybody who's ever had a sibling like, you know, like pieces are always unequal.

446
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:29,720
Like, I can tell you two pieces, even though the original piece was unequal size and like that can be okay.

447
00:49:30,890 --> 00:49:38,570
Absolutely. So that idea and thinking about like, you know, in an intervention, you know, would you think about like,

448
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:43,909
okay, if it's an eating intervention, like how much, you know, eat more or less of this.

449
00:49:43,910 --> 00:49:45,290
You know, it's a serving.

450
00:49:45,290 --> 00:49:53,570
So like all of these things around kind of quantity of what's in front of you really can shift around over time, not younger kids.

451
00:49:54,470 --> 00:50:03,830
So there's a lot of education that goes on in like elementary and middle school classrooms about unhealthy eating like project healthy schools.

452
00:50:04,550 --> 00:50:13,610
And so thinking about where kids are in terms of what they understand around these basic cognitive skills can be helpful.

453
00:50:15,590 --> 00:50:22,580
The other thing that I like to think about with her, because she uses the counting strategy, is that she's already got counting.

454
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:27,920
And so it's like you can work with that. You know, you can say like, Oh, great, you counted this, let's count this other one.

455
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:35,420
So you can kind of it's like an example of how you can take the skills that the kid is sewing and apply them to something new.

456
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:49,930
Let's see, there's a lot of other examples of sort of things that, you know, again, as adults, we think, oh, that's so obvious and kids just miss it.

457
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:54,650
And so I think we always want to just like double check ourselves, especially we're talking about kids who are like under ten.

458
00:50:55,800 --> 00:51:03,270
Certainly preschoolers. We'll talk much more about that. But they're operating often in like a different reality from what we are.

459
00:51:03,270 --> 00:51:10,260
And so understanding if we're working directly with kids, how to sort of translate that knowledge to them, it's important.

460
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:18,570
Okay. So attachment theory, which we've talked about already a little bit,

461
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:23,100
this slide again within the thing and we'll talk more about attachment theory and how

462
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:26,880
it kind of underlies a lot of these excellent interventions and nurturing care stuff.

463
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:33,270
But just to sort of as a brief review, this is this idea that it's building on both the biology,

464
00:51:33,270 --> 00:51:38,640
which is that ecological animal studies like Konrad Lorenz and the Ducks following him around,

465
00:51:39,390 --> 00:51:45,960
as well as psychodynamic theories like ideas that live in our head about how relationships work.

466
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:50,370
Those are psychodynamic really broadly speaking.

467
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:54,930
Another thing about attachment theory is really specific to certain relationships.

468
00:51:54,930 --> 00:51:59,400
Like you develop attachment type relationships with specific individuals.

469
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:05,220
The great majority of the research in this has been done with mother's biological mothers,

470
00:52:05,730 --> 00:52:11,620
but it's really important to note that there's a lot of different caregivers out there in a child's life.

471
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:17,880
Hopefully that's great for a child. And so most of this attachment research is done on the mother.

472
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:23,549
But there's some research on fathers. There's some research on other caregivers.

473
00:52:23,550 --> 00:52:27,450
And there's really, I would say, cool emerging research.

474
00:52:27,450 --> 00:52:32,970
And I think it's kind of prompted by the pandemic pods in a little bit of a way around,

475
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:41,520
like what the scientific term is like alo parenting or sort of caregiving environments where there's multiple caregivers involved.

476
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:45,530
So we'll talk more about that as well. But I always want to highlight attachment.

477
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:54,209
It's really important, but it's also the great majority of research is based on mothers internal representation.

478
00:52:54,210 --> 00:53:02,040
Is that idea, the psychodynamic idea, how you think about relationships impacts how you act in relationships basically.

479
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:10,200
And then the purpose of attachment is to sort of provide that support base and also allow the infant to explore and learn about the world.

480
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:13,920
And that's the John Bowlby.

481
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:20,370
And then Mary Ainsworth is the person who said like have those these different types of attachment.

482
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:26,100
She was actually an introvert. And like, here's what they look like in this parent child dyad.

483
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:28,470
And there's been a lot of, you know,

484
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:36,780
many decades of research showing that these different patterns of parent child behavior early in life map onto later outcomes.

485
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:39,270
So we will delve more into that.

486
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:50,549
The other thing I just want to highlight is that these attachment videos or the attachment relationship is evolves over time and so over many,

487
00:53:50,550 --> 00:53:53,280
many different interactions between this parent child dyad.

488
00:53:53,850 --> 00:53:59,520
So for next time, you guys are going to watch these baby videos as the lead in response activity.

489
00:54:00,030 --> 00:54:08,690
And so just thinking about those baby videos. How might the relationship be like emerging through these interactions?

490
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:13,160
We'll talk more about that, but that's sort of the basis for attachment developing.

491
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:23,370
I did show this also, and I think I can probably show again, it's a goofy graphic, but it really summarizes this is the whole deal of attachment.

492
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:29,360
It's like when I'm feeling secure, I can go out and I can explore.

493
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:35,510
But then I'm getting a little freaked out. I've explored too much. I'm like getting hit with all this new information that makes me anxious.

494
00:54:35,510 --> 00:54:43,670
So then I come back to you, and this sort of caregiver role is like a secure base and safe haven for when kids are upset.

495
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:48,540
And we'll talk about that more and.

496
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:57,200
I wanted to also just highlight this again, going back to this idea of like how theory can really drive interventions.

497
00:54:57,830 --> 00:55:01,460
So here we have like a trying maybe colicky baby.

498
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:06,260
If anybody has was a colicky baby or has heard about colicky babies or interacted.

499
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:17,860
So they cry a lot. And it's this idea of they cry for like 3 hours, three days in a row, 3 hours a day, under three months of age.

500
00:55:17,870 --> 00:55:22,069
So like it's a sample of three if you think about colicky babies and it's just like a lot of crying.

501
00:55:22,070 --> 00:55:25,250
It can be stressful for the family and for the parents.

502
00:55:26,090 --> 00:55:32,630
So if you're thinking about Max, if you're like a maturation, right, you're like a dyed in the wool, like, oh, it's all maceration.

503
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:39,200
And you can say like, Oh, I had a healthy baby and maybe the baby has college because of these first complications.

504
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:42,349
And they're sort of emotionally disregulated, really.

505
00:55:42,350 --> 00:55:46,579
Maybe there's nothing I can do because they're going to interact less with the parent and sort of end

506
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:51,230
up with poor language or poor social skills because they cannot have this kind of socialization.

507
00:55:52,550 --> 00:56:01,100
But if you're more complex thinker, you might think about a way that development unfolds like this.

508
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:07,339
So there's you can have, first, health complications or colicky babies crying a lot that can kind of lead a parent

509
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:11,360
to start handling the baby in a more anxious way or like in a more stress way.

510
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:16,190
They might not be able to feel confident in their parenting because they can't soothe their baby.

511
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:25,280
And then that lack of soothing the baby kind of continues to be fussy, doesn't get sort of these early baby skills to like, calm down their emotions.

512
00:56:25,970 --> 00:56:30,470
The parent baby gets a little bit resentful. It's like, oh my gosh, the baby like crazy.

513
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:36,740
I can't ever see them. I'm going to sort of disengage a little bit from the interaction because the caregiver disengaged.

514
00:56:36,830 --> 00:56:41,059
That's maybe why the baby is ending up with poor language or social skills.

515
00:56:41,060 --> 00:56:44,630
So like the start point and end point might be the same.

516
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:50,839
But here, if you kind of break apart the developmental process more, what it does,

517
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:57,200
why it's important is that it gives you more windows for intervention and more like points for intervention potentially.

518
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,959
So you could say, Oh, interesting,

519
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:07,430
I'm noticing that this caregiver is handling the baby in a really awkward way and they feel uncomfortable because they can't soothe the baby.

520
00:57:07,430 --> 00:57:13,430
Well, maybe I can intervene to the caregiver to sort of Suzanne anxiety and give them some different tools to handle the baby.

521
00:57:14,270 --> 00:57:19,040
Same thing over here, like working directly with the baby, same thing over here.

522
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:29,060
So it sort of gives you these different points to intervene with if you make if you try to represent development in as complex a way as it is.

523
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:35,870
And so I think we will talk a lot more about like these infant parent interventions,

524
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:44,270
but those baby videos are kind of the first for some of you've probably looked at maybe other baby steps for people who haven't,

525
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:49,249
it's kind of like a window into, wow, this is what I'm talking about.

526
00:57:49,250 --> 00:57:52,549
So like these kinds of interactions and how they play out over time,

527
00:57:52,550 --> 00:57:57,320
like all the time in the infant's life are important to like really get into your head.

528
00:58:00,770 --> 00:58:17,810
Okay. I wanted to say, okay, a few more, few more examples of this going back and forth between theory and like why we care about theory.

529
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:27,880
So this Kronos system idea. It's again like we are living through a huge kind of system event of the pandemic.

530
00:58:29,530 --> 00:58:39,220
And what's really important here is thinking about outcomes and health outcomes for any kind of outcomes family income,

531
00:58:39,490 --> 00:58:42,549
child achievement, child later earnings.

532
00:58:42,550 --> 00:58:53,620
As an adult, all of these things can kind of be shaped by big world events like this is a is the lines are the different recessions,

533
00:58:56,200 --> 00:59:01,150
things like common things like the Great Depression and also the age at which

534
00:59:01,390 --> 00:59:06,490
the child is when they undergo or they or their family undergoes these events.

535
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:13,440
So I don't know if people have thoughts on the Great Depression kind of question

536
00:59:14,820 --> 00:59:19,620
that ten year old kids when the sort of the depths of the Great Depression,

537
00:59:21,630 --> 00:59:29,640
they were trapped over their life in studies that showed that kids who were around ten years old tended to have better kind of

538
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:37,380
life outcomes than either kids who were infants during the Great Depression or kids who were teens during the Great Depression.

539
00:59:38,730 --> 00:59:46,730
So why do you guys think that might be? What might be somehow protective about being ten versus being a teen?

540
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:55,820
Yeah, I think like while going through this, like there was like critical periods,

541
00:59:56,740 --> 01:00:08,720
like especially the kinds of like food or like insurance that they're like the magnitude of that might be amplified for them versus your ten stages,

542
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:17,120
so you might be less vulnerable. Yeah. So like their physical growth would definitely have that impact, right?

543
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:24,050
So ten year olds are a little bit protected for going through something like the Great Depression and there'd be no food and limited access to things,

544
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:32,260
but infants would really be hit hard and would sort of set their growth trajectory as probably lower over time.

545
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:36,560
Yeah, yeah. I'm thinking about that too, I would imagine.

546
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:39,230
And I think this is probably true for some ten year olds.

547
01:00:39,230 --> 01:00:46,970
But in most families, teenagers are a lot more aware of the problems in the family and like their parents might share with them.

548
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:55,070
You know, their struggles with money that they might not share with a ten year old or a table may not be able to fully understand.

549
01:00:56,060 --> 01:01:01,580
So I can imagine that conflict is a source of toxic stress for a teenager.

550
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:07,790
Very definitely. That teenager could be like taking on much more aware of of what's happening in the family.

551
01:01:07,790 --> 01:01:18,740
Absolutely. Um, I don't know if teens were working during two times, it sort of affected them like.

552
01:01:18,950 --> 01:01:22,920
Yeah, for sure. Yeah. So that in that bigger social context, right.

553
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:31,780
So family context like nutrition growth context, family context and then the sort of bigger work context teens when you know,

554
01:01:31,820 --> 01:01:37,490
in this retirement like 1930, 1929, teens were out in the workforce a lot of the time.

555
01:01:37,490 --> 01:01:45,230
But like if there was no work to be had, they were sort of losing the opportunity to get work skills, experience connections, establish a career.

556
01:01:46,130 --> 01:01:51,260
So definitely that sort of delayed their their later life trajectory.

557
01:01:52,610 --> 01:02:00,290
Also with this example, thinking about what happens 15, ten, 10 to 15 years later was World War Two.

558
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:09,259
And so those kids who were ten in 1934, 28 and 1940, and they all of a sudden, if they made it through World War Two,

559
01:02:09,260 --> 01:02:14,629
then their like opportunities exploded because of the economy after World War Two.

560
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:22,700
So like all of those like big picture system factors really shape the life, life history.

561
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:31,060
And thinking about, you know, the recession of 2008 and the housing crisis as well as COVID 19.

562
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:36,810
And I think this is like the critical question that we just don't know.

563
01:02:36,940 --> 01:02:41,679
Right. And we can imagine lots of different ways that this might play out and thinking

564
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:48,960
about how COVID timing is related to developmental timing and family events.

565
01:02:48,970 --> 01:02:51,130
This is, I think, a really important question,

566
01:02:51,340 --> 01:02:58,780
and I think the answer will probably be it depends what outcomes you're looking at, what the family situation was.

567
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:02,740
I would say for those of you who've taken like statistics and seen that interaction,

568
01:03:02,740 --> 01:03:12,700
moderation affects that question is probably moderated by family circumstances during COVID 19 of what happened in the immediate family.

569
01:03:12,700 --> 01:03:16,510
But is there an overall generational effect? Know like do all?

570
01:03:16,570 --> 01:03:21,850
I was just reading an article last night about Head Start, which we'll talk more about,

571
01:03:21,850 --> 01:03:25,960
but they're still requiring masks like per their policy on kids,

572
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:35,590
which is just tough for like language learning and all sorts of things that that kids need to see people's faces for motion regulation.

573
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:39,910
So like, what was the best, worst age to go through COVID?

574
01:03:39,910 --> 01:03:46,900
Like, that's, you know, sort of an overly simplified question, but I think that's something that's important for us all to be thinking about.

575
01:03:47,650 --> 01:03:56,229
And of course, we will all remember COVID, but in future thinking like making that link, right?

576
01:03:56,230 --> 01:04:02,020
Like sort of saying, well, wait, how old were you when you had to go to school in your bed for two years?

577
01:04:02,050 --> 01:04:07,390
You know, like what what years were those, you know, for you? And I think that is really critical.

578
01:04:07,390 --> 01:04:10,600
Like, did you become a new parent for the first time during COVID?

579
01:04:10,610 --> 01:04:16,569
Like, what was that like? And how has that maybe shaped your psychology around parenting, your stress,

580
01:04:16,570 --> 01:04:24,040
your feelings of like being able to have a network of other caregivers, iPads, etc.?

581
01:04:24,430 --> 01:04:30,190
Did you experience grief and loss? So a lot of this is going to really play out over time.

582
01:04:31,180 --> 01:04:39,460
But I would argue it's really important then to think about those developmental questions in terms of how that the impacts have played out.

583
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:48,040
Okay. I think I'll just go through two more quick things that.

584
01:04:49,430 --> 01:04:55,759
Again, kind of I think are good for situating us in this beginning part of the course when we're

585
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:59,510
talking about these really big picture issues that we'll come back to over and over.

586
01:04:59,510 --> 01:05:09,700
But. As the next part of the course, the next meeting we'll be talking about infancy really dove into infancy, and then we'll kind of go by age.

587
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:11,950
So this is the last big picture.

588
01:05:11,980 --> 01:05:24,850
What I think you guys know, I like I love the big picture, but this is the life course health development model, super broad image of it.

589
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:30,610
But it's this idea of early intervention, which we'll talk more about in infancy.

590
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:37,600
You may not see so much right there at the beginning, but over time that developmental trajectory,

591
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:45,130
what we want to do with early intervention is like shift it. If we see a kid is at risk in some way,

592
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:56,379
we want to intervene early while things are more plastic and movable so that we can put the child on a better trajectory here.

593
01:05:56,380 --> 01:06:00,970
If that's not problems, panic, disease, risk here, they're early intervention.

594
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:05,350
Over time, they would have less chronic disease risk than if they didn't get the early intervention.

595
01:06:06,370 --> 01:06:14,360
And the other thing I like to point out. Is that even though my bias and the field's bias I think is early intervention.

596
01:06:15,460 --> 01:06:21,040
For good reason. It's also super critical to remember that development isn't linear.

597
01:06:21,610 --> 01:06:26,560
And so we saw all these different differences and different theories and ways that development happens.

598
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:29,320
And we know that development isn't linear.

599
01:06:29,380 --> 01:06:37,630
And so that means that there's more context and opportunities for intervention across the lifespan and again in this past week,

600
01:06:37,630 --> 01:06:40,150
trend in childhood and adolescence.

601
01:06:40,150 --> 01:06:50,410
But there's lots of different interventions that we can think about to kind of place at different time points in the kid's life.

602
01:06:51,550 --> 01:06:59,200
And then so here's my here's my favorite chart and many favorite charts, but this is the one from that meeting here.

603
01:07:00,370 --> 01:07:07,669
So the key thing here is that I think. You know, you're talking about these like really, really, really early interventions.

604
01:07:07,670 --> 01:07:14,180
And here's some ideas, like really specific ideas. And if people are interested, that article is like chock full of info.

605
01:07:15,740 --> 01:07:20,780
But then here we get to early childhood, we get to school age and then adolescence.

606
01:07:21,230 --> 01:07:28,400
And it's also important to think about adolescence as a pre parents adolescent really wants to think that.

607
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:34,760
But it's true like sort of biologically and for all these other sort of socialization reasons as well.

608
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:40,729
So, you know, people who are interested in that don't have hypothesis.

609
01:07:40,730 --> 01:07:48,830
The developmental origins of health and disease, a theme of prenatal influences where you really want to go is adolescence.

610
01:07:49,010 --> 01:07:56,030
Because that's when this sort of prenatal environment and as people hit puberty, they're sort of forming their prenatal environments.

611
01:07:58,130 --> 01:08:02,360
The other thing that I would just highlight is that there's for obvious reasons,

612
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:10,820
there's so much focus on girls and women, but male health is certainly also important and it's just been less study.

613
01:08:11,210 --> 01:08:16,130
So we know less about sort of the male contributions here.

614
01:08:18,140 --> 01:08:23,780
But for people who are interested, there's definitely some literature in that like autism spectrum space that, for example,

615
01:08:23,780 --> 01:08:31,099
older fathers, there's an association between having an older father and being more likely to have be on the autism spectrum.

616
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:36,140
So we don't know that much because the research hasn't really been done.

617
01:08:36,590 --> 01:08:43,880
But men are also important in this picture, even though so much of this in this whole field is called like maternal child health.

618
01:08:44,390 --> 01:08:47,390
Right. And again, for obvious reasons.

619
01:08:47,390 --> 01:08:51,110
But at the same time, it's important to, to, to point that out.

620
01:08:51,860 --> 01:08:59,900
Um, let's see, I think my last one is just on this process, which we've talked about a little bit already, which is great.

621
01:09:00,980 --> 01:09:04,100
And we'll get more into this when we talk about parenting in early childhood.

622
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:08,840
But that idea of like modeling rewards, what are the rewards?

623
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:15,020
What are you unintentionally rewarding by paying attention to like the behaviors you don't want to see?

624
01:09:16,010 --> 01:09:27,050
And we talk about this with parents a lot like. You know, you tell me to ignore bad behavior, but, like, I can't ignore, like, dangerous behavior.

625
01:09:27,260 --> 01:09:34,730
So what happens then? Right. And what is the dangerous behavior in your environment that you're raising kids in?

626
01:09:35,570 --> 01:09:41,060
So how much can you ignore without putting the child in harm's way?

627
01:09:41,690 --> 01:09:44,839
So that's a big question, I think, to a lot of these parenting interventions.

628
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:51,890
And that's appropriate, like pants, pants push back and they're like, well, I don't want to ignore hitting his sister.

629
01:09:52,910 --> 01:09:59,810
Well, like, can you ignore some of it? Can you ignore, you know, the lead up to hitting the sister and then if they hit, can you do something?

630
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:09,890
So it's like very complicated. This rewards question that what little kids you can select a really concrete goal.

631
01:10:12,260 --> 01:10:20,620
Potty training is a classic for like reward systems management, too, because they can get a star every time they go on the fun.

632
01:10:21,530 --> 01:10:29,810
We'll talk more about that. But that's like a really concrete example of how to use that kind of intervention.

633
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:39,200
Here's the stage theory again, and I think I said this on the video, but I think what's important here is really to think about motivation.

634
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:42,950
So I don't know if people take a motivational interviewing type courses or read about that,

635
01:10:42,950 --> 01:10:49,350
but we think so much about what's motivating or not motivating in health behavior change.

636
01:10:49,370 --> 01:10:57,199
And I would argue we also know there's like a you can be a motivated and you can have a whole lot of barriers that just disrupt your motivation,

637
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:58,730
which are really important to remember.

638
01:10:59,390 --> 01:11:04,580
But even if we're thinking about like, well, why would someone ever, like, be tempted to make a behavior change?

639
01:11:04,580 --> 01:11:08,300
Well, you know, I'm really talking here about, like a little bit older.

640
01:11:08,630 --> 01:11:20,750
Yeah, but these could sort of these stage theories or this like, what is your developmental like core conflict, your task or your stage?

641
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:24,560
How does that play into your motivation?

642
01:11:24,590 --> 01:11:26,960
So that's we'll talk more about that also in adolescence.

643
01:11:28,310 --> 01:11:37,190
But I do like to use that example of adolescence because peer pressure certainly is like a process that happens in adolescence.

644
01:11:37,190 --> 01:11:42,950
It's a high salience activity, like a construct.

645
01:11:44,660 --> 01:11:48,770
And so we can use that in our interventions, but we can, you know,

646
01:11:48,770 --> 01:11:52,700
which one to try to find is something like peer pressure, which is really motivating for adolescents.

647
01:11:53,300 --> 01:11:59,330
But we want to see can we do that for good? So if you guys have seen these interventions that you talk about,

648
01:11:59,330 --> 01:12:05,690
it is like harnessing adolescent rage sometimes about like the food industry is like trying to kill you.

649
01:12:05,990 --> 01:12:11,299
So therefore you should like eat more healthy food, right? Or the truth campaign that's smoking.

650
01:12:11,300 --> 01:12:17,240
If people remember that they're familiar with that, they had adolescents sort of get angry,

651
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:26,000
like harness adolescent rage with big tobacco and sort of made all these campaigns around,

652
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:31,069
okay, you want to, you know, in this adolescent stage, like, what's your identity?

653
01:12:31,070 --> 01:12:34,870
Do you want to be a smoker and be with big tobacco or do you not?

654
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:43,430
You know, and so that kind of thing is a nice example of this, what adolescents care about how to harness their motivation for better for them,

655
01:12:44,090 --> 01:12:47,120
hopefully not for bad, but we're always trying to avoid the path.

656
01:12:48,260 --> 01:12:52,700
Um, let's see any have any questions on those?

657
01:12:53,150 --> 01:12:57,470
I know we've talked a lot about. Cool.

658
01:12:58,190 --> 01:13:05,660
Um. Okay, then next time we, like I said, we'll dove into infancy.

659
01:13:06,410 --> 01:13:13,310
We'll, like, talk about the baby videos. You guys will watch those and comment in the on on canvas,

660
01:13:13,940 --> 01:13:19,040
and we'll really kind of get into what infants do and like how we might intervene with

661
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:25,400
intense and what contexts for interventions are helpful to think about for infants.

662
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:33,710
So yeah, I will stick around too for a few minutes if questions or comments or about that.

663
01:13:34,850 --> 01:13:42,580
And yeah, and if you guys want to take your name things with you and then just bring it back so I can have a learning means of yeah,

664
01:13:44,420 --> 01:14:19,370
they will have a lot of very cool opportunities that I do.

665
01:14:19,370 --> 01:14:24,350
Yeah. It's a meeting.

666
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:47,390
I couldn't get out of the meeting on Thursday and then it would be the last one or Oh, I can do that.

667
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:53,310
But this is I don't want to see Representative Maccabi Tel Aviv.

668
01:14:56,990 --> 01:15:01,680
I was just curious. I know I'm going to talk last time you mentioned something, you research too.

669
01:15:01,700 --> 01:15:15,700
So I was curious what you research in terms of the motley assortment and remuneration, I think.

670
01:15:17,030 --> 01:15:22,580
Yeah. So I do a lot of like eating research and a lot of that.

671
01:15:22,890 --> 01:15:32,150
I can't stress enough the city and the work that I've done is on that idea of like kids who are

672
01:15:32,390 --> 01:15:42,230
emotionally disregulated and I like to sort of through the motions to establish that like being calm,

673
01:15:42,230 --> 01:15:45,760
which we eat like certain foods have. Like, I sure,

674
01:15:46,230 --> 01:15:55,910
I'm sure I'll talk about that if I was in that club and that is like sort of physiological soothing so that that reinforces our experience of like,

675
01:15:55,910 --> 01:16:01,790
oh, I'm, I feel better not do it more upset with yourself.

676
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:07,970
Yeah. Yeah. I was like, I personally am also stressed.

677
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:11,629
Here is what I say. What is interesting is I'm like curious.

678
01:16:11,630 --> 01:16:19,730
And that aspect that I was initially thinking about adults, I'm thinking about term well,

679
01:16:19,730 --> 01:16:25,820
and I think it relates because then you think like as an adult or as adult parent and you recognize like,

680
01:16:25,820 --> 01:16:33,260
hey, am I doing these behaviors and I'm modeling those behaviors and do I model like, Oh, I feel really distressed.

681
01:16:33,260 --> 01:16:36,409
I'm going to go out for a ride, you know, like that.

682
01:16:36,410 --> 01:16:39,530
It would be super interesting. Yeah.

683
01:16:39,530 --> 01:16:43,099
I mean, there's so much potential, you know, it's hard because of course, like,

684
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:48,770
we're all carrying our habits and we're, you know, have different genetic loadings and everything like that.

685
01:16:49,070 --> 01:16:52,280
Actually, I was thinking about you because I just I was asked to be on this podcast.

686
01:16:52,280 --> 01:16:57,680
And so then listening to her podcast, it's like, what? But I think, I think they're really good actually.

687
01:16:58,520 --> 01:17:01,670
It's called the Nourished Child. Child.

688
01:17:01,790 --> 01:17:06,019
Okay. So that might be interesting for you to check out. I know I still need to set up office hours.

689
01:17:06,020 --> 01:17:10,810
I was just trying to make sure it was, like, useful. And I'm meeting my mentor tomorrow and awesome.

690
01:17:11,450 --> 01:17:15,469
I'm trying to figure out, like, so many ideas and interests and I like,

691
01:17:15,470 --> 01:17:20,060
I'm struggling to figure out what to narrow it down to and like what to move forward with.

692
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:29,000
Before, like last semester I was doing, I was actually looking at chronic stress but like in the workplace and how that impacts health.

693
01:17:29,390 --> 01:17:36,350
And then it was looking at like, how can I go back as like built a company and almost, it's like almost like a consulting company,

694
01:17:36,350 --> 01:17:48,169
but go back into the workplace or corporations and look at assessing health and like placing interventions, but not just like wellness programs.

695
01:17:48,170 --> 01:17:53,030
And I say that in quotes because like, they like check out the insurance.

696
01:17:53,030 --> 01:17:58,500
Yeah. But so then I was like, But do I still want to go that path?

697
01:17:58,520 --> 01:18:02,950
And then I was like, I'm really interested in a prevention, though. Which is where the children come in.

698
01:18:02,980 --> 01:18:08,990
So that's where it is. But when I, I feel like a few times when I was talking about stuff, you're like, Oh, I researched that.

699
01:18:08,990 --> 01:18:16,250
I was like, okay, really good resource here. And yeah, there's definitely, you know, there's a lot of that.

700
01:18:17,590 --> 01:18:25,120
You know, there's what I mean, what's hard about obesity is that it's just it's really it's a tough one to change,

701
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:28,959
you know, because it's so overdetermined in a lot of ways, right?

702
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:38,200
Because of our crazy food environment, right? Yeah. And so I think with, you know, parenting and trying to figure out, like,

703
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:43,000
I think I think that that actually that Jill Castle, this nurse child person, she does a good job about.

704
01:18:44,180 --> 01:18:50,690
Kind of keeping our eye on the ball, like eating nutrition, but also acknowledging like,

705
01:18:50,780 --> 01:18:56,239
you can't fight against it all the time because it's going to be a really hard challenge.

706
01:18:56,240 --> 01:18:59,360
And that's exhausting. What do we tell parents to do?

707
01:18:59,420 --> 01:19:03,860
Yeah, I think yeah.

708
01:19:03,890 --> 01:19:11,780
I mean, it's kind of like I think about these parenting interventions in general and how to,

709
01:19:11,990 --> 01:19:15,590
you know, support parents to be the best parent they can be.

710
01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:19,820
Mm hmm. And give these sort of specific tools around.

711
01:19:20,030 --> 01:19:27,920
Yeah. Managing to give limited give choices, but limited choices, which I feel like so many of the things that I tend to say I saw in that podcast.

712
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:35,300
Yeah. So yeah, I felt like she had a good take because I think it's really hard.

713
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:39,440
I think it's. This is really hard to.
