1
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:20,190
Hmm. Thought.

2
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:41,050
Hello. Hi. We?

3
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:56,960
Can you see what this? I know.

4
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,410
It's good in my library. Okay.

5
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:12,170
Welcome to the last class. So today, basically, I'm going just to give you some final remarks and then we are going to go over the exam.

6
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:15,890
So I will explain everything that I am expecting from you.

7
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:24,260
And then we will spend most of the time kind of like doing the exam here, and you're supposed now to work on your own.

8
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:32,599
But I will be here to answer any questions or anything. So then it will be good to kind of like go I mean, during this 2 hours today,

9
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:38,420
you can go over everything to make sure that everything is clear, even if you cannot finish everything because this is at their home.

10
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:42,670
But it will be due next week. But it will be good that you review everything.

11
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:48,530
I mean, I will still be available for answering any anything that you have during the week.

12
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:55,400
So don't worry. But clearly in person is better when I am here to answer your questions.

13
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:02,090
Okay. So let me kind of like briefly telling you about the exam.

14
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:10,610
So the exam has two parts. The first part is practice analyzing the data and seems is the same as you've been doing in the labs.

15
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,860
So now it's kind of like a different theme, a little more integrative because it's taking on a few topics, right?

16
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:19,339
But it's exactly the same. It's actually addressing that you have used before.

17
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:27,290
Also the Costa Rican heart. This is a study which is a mosquito control study.

18
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:32,599
Remember that you will have to kind of like do some correlations adjust for the television think is in

19
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:38,510
the reservoirs do some logistic and things like that so it's kind of like some variation of the labs,

20
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:43,520
right? So hopefully you should be able to to do it without any problem.

21
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,450
And this second part is more like theory.

22
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:53,600
So there are like three questions in which you have to kind of like integrate the theory concepts that you have learned before,

23
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,589
which I'm sure you have had also theory questions during the lab.

24
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:02,060
So they are touching on this same issue. So it's kind of like, you know, we have a big issue.

25
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:10,940
So so I have put like more very little instructions and kind of like some of the things that please don't forget to do this and this

26
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:18,170
and this kind of like the the rectangle society for the last that remember when I'm asking to be your source code on relevant output,

27
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:28,050
don't forget to do it, okay? Because it's important. So this is a big home, but now you are not supposed to be working in person, right?

28
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:35,090
So. So that's why you will be signing out an honor code, kind of like saying that I'm doing this on my own.

29
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:39,050
Yes. I don't know. Is everyone having the same problems with the computer?

30
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:47,460
Or is it just a few people at home? Yeah.

31
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,480
So what's going on? The computers won't let us open.

32
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:56,610
We can't find. Seriously? Oh, just like certain things.

33
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:00,810
Like the one final thing. It's not like you.

34
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:08,380
Like this one. Like this one, even. And then it's like I go.

35
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:16,110
But it doesn't seem like might come to their heads now.

36
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:23,790
Yeah. I really don't know. My name tag is very confused because I see them.

37
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:31,829
Some people have laptops. Do you know something?

38
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:36,650
That is what you. Oh, you know why?

39
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:41,060
Does they have a schedule? It's kind of like it was.

40
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:47,720
Was it yesterday or the day before they would make the fellowship nominated this year to watch and read?

41
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:54,260
Maybe something happened with that. So you risk that it doesn't work either.

42
00:04:54,650 --> 00:05:04,870
Just we just turned it on their lives track and you try again just to give that.

43
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:11,220
Let me. Let me. I.

44
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:34,230
That's nothing.

45
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:57,300
A space helpdesk. Hi. This is not really.

46
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:00,550
I'm in the computer lab. This is room 20 1615.

47
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:06,390
None of the computers work. No computers work in one room in 2615.

48
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:11,100
This is the lab and the computer lab in this Beichuan. Okay.

49
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:15,900
So then the cameras are turning on or. Yeah, they've been trying to.

50
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:23,100
Apparently all of them were all they put going to try you know when you have this is thing medical.

51
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:32,690
Okay. So basically, I mean, look, I see windows, but, you know, I mean, there's plastic so they can open around.

52
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:41,280
So of course they turned on and they just can't properly understand or what exactly like anything that happened.

53
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:47,410
They cannot open any of the of the. You know, that's okay.

54
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:52,710
But we have to be able to find that. I mean, they are open, but they cannot really do anything.

55
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:02,479
So you can open like, like a web browser or anything and you will be it has been here before me,

56
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:09,870
which is that because it's open source we can look at like the model you with this season.

57
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:20,360
So I mean there are many things that of the things that they do and none of them should just be simply shut down for a week.

58
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:28,620
Yeah, that's that's a tricky one. So I'm just trying to understand exactly what's going on here.

59
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:31,960
So. So you. You can identify them on the computer, right?

60
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:39,220
Like you put in your unique name and password, and it took you to, like, the screen of, like, the human background and stuff.

61
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:40,120
Right.

62
00:07:40,330 --> 00:08:04,030
So they have what I see is that they have windows there, but they cannot access any of the things that we are able to know that they would you know,

63
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:14,800
I'm getting for the library, so I guess I will come down there and look at that.

64
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:22,060
Yeah, I can I can look back on it.

65
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:36,930
I see it today. I know this will look like.

66
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:46,900
I don't know. I explain myself so poorly. Sorry.

67
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:52,950
But anyway. Okay, so. Well, help is on the way, hopefully.

68
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:57,030
Let me kind of like. Okay.

69
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:00,720
So then hopefully we will be able to work on this one today.

70
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:07,920
The worst case scenario is that they home. So then. Then I can explain everything to you and then I will be available for questions.

71
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:18,960
So it's due next Friday at 1 p.m. and please don't be late this time because I'm not going to lie tight deadline for entering the grades.

72
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:25,460
So, I mean, if you really need an extension for kind of like excruciating, you know, something really important,

73
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:32,490
I can give you maybe one or two days, but not not not too many, because I have to to to put the grades in Albany.

74
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:35,700
Okay. The same for any.

75
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:41,910
You have unique thing that you have in kind of like work before, for whatever reason you can.

76
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:46,979
I mean, you still have one week to finish. Okay. Okay.

77
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:53,700
So before we go into the final exam, so you remember this is like.

78
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:56,900
Right. So I added.

79
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:05,380
So having if I only want you to remain one thing in the whole semester is how to adjust for energy intake using the receiver method.

80
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:12,440
And I think at this point you have done it so many times, naturally you are sick of it, but you will still have to do it.

81
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:19,260
One more, right? So so this is this is one of the very important can right methods of adjusting for that, I think.

82
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:25,460
And this is a very kind of like, you know, specific thing for nutritional epidemiology, right?

83
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:30,090
I mean, other people have done this in other foods, too, but not not so often as we are with.

84
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:32,180
All right. So remember this place.

85
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:40,530
I won't go into into those, but remember that basically you do this linear regression with the nutrient and the calories you save there by seedless.

86
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:45,780
And remember that because you have to lock transform, right.

87
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:49,290
And you have to kind of like the receivers are meaningless, right?

88
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:56,279
So then you do a back transformation and as we said that in the back transformation is thinking that way,

89
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:01,769
responding to function because it's in the landscape and the recentering is just adding that kind of

90
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:09,120
like average in kind of like the expected intake for that person with an average caloric intake.

91
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:14,040
Right. So and you have done this dozens of times, so hopefully you will have any any problem with that.

92
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:17,880
Okay. So just remember that this is one of those key things.

93
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:22,300
So please remember to go back to that. Okay.

94
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:26,190
Again, remember, these are kind of like a few. Yes.

95
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:30,090
Final remarks before I go into explaining the final.

96
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:35,670
Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please fill out the evaluations.

97
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:40,540
Let me know what I can improve for next year and let me know. So what work?

98
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:43,709
Well, so I can keep it. Yeah. Hi. Hello. Hi.

99
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:48,480
How are you? Yeah, not your computer. No, not on all of it.

100
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:53,700
So actually, mine is working because I can. I am. I'm still able to access conversation.

101
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:58,500
We have. We are so. So we can leave it over here.

102
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,850
We can put in here, you know, like I just listen to the.

103
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,160
We started the day there.

104
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:14,520
Yeah, we showed up.

105
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:31,680
We started looking for items. I mean, I know was one of them, but it is a seven in more than one out of them.

106
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:48,820
Like when I tried to download. I didn't know you about, but you could open so you could open a web browser and you can only open you.

107
00:12:48,990 --> 00:13:00,000
So how can you speak up? Okay, so everyone has a different role and apparently not all of them are going have great.

108
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:10,219
Well with the taskbar, you can move anything from here. It's like July 1st.

109
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:13,730
You are okay, right? Yeah. Yeah.

110
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:18,310
But then, have you tried shutting yours down and. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

111
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,400
Everyone tried twice. Yeah, I think you.

112
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:30,870
Did anyone complain about this lab before? There was no use in the lab, probably since there has been some use.

113
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:34,439
But 90 day early in the day, no. Okay, Natalie.

114
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,620
So maybe I think this is the first stop of the day.

115
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:45,330
You think it was a shut shutdown of this week? Maybe. Let's hope that's not the case.

116
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:52,140
My thing I did was I didn't turn it off. Yeah, right.

117
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:03,700
Indefinitely. I wish I was done.

118
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,270
Two days ago. It was two days ago. Yeah, that's right. You're right. And this one apparently is.

119
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:14,740
Let me see, because this one is working. I think the one is okay.

120
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:18,460
I think so. Because, I mean, I've been able to access.

121
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:22,760
Yeah, mine is fine. That one is a vista. Okay.

122
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:28,060
Which is different? Yeah. More resilient. Yeah. So this one's been all in one.

123
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:41,690
Okay. Yeah. Yeah. One Shin Bet on him from then on was simply strangled in.

124
00:14:53,320 --> 00:15:04,780
Yeah. Okay. Let's say a business. I think that.

125
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:19,820
Oh. And the word is that he would turn around and look around.

126
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:26,490
Oh. Some of them are, actually.

127
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:33,020
That's what I was saying to this day. You see, the problem here is.

128
00:15:48,790 --> 00:16:33,290
Yeah, I think you can. He hasn't responded.

129
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:38,560
Now it's about of their benefit. But I think.

130
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:55,890
Almost all of these are.

131
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:29,810
You. Try saying it doesn't make sense.

132
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:43,500
It's sort of a connected. I just want.

133
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:51,610
I'm looking into the night to see. This is.

134
00:18:20,560 --> 00:19:16,080
Okay. Do you think you can get. Not as a subject of discussion.

135
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:36,630
Well, if this one. I think that's working.

136
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:41,450
In my personal.

137
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:48,880
I cannot say I was able to. What going on?

138
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:54,560
Yeah. Yes, I think he meant.

139
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:21,680
Yeah. Yeah.

140
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:27,380
Yeah. Okay. Sorry.

141
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:32,190
Just remember how we all want.

142
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:45,540
There's always been this when you lose.

143
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:59,180
Okay. Michelle. When you attempt.

144
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,990
How do you that?

145
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:44,810
Yeah, I know that that is.

146
00:23:44,830 --> 00:25:04,770
No. Well, that was has.

147
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:12,060
I think one is responding. Okay, this one.

148
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:17,720
So. So what I do is I.

149
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:27,740
Now before I do it here. You know, I never met this.

150
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:42,820
But I don't know that it is that you want me to be able person that is saying that you this kind of character doesn't.

151
00:25:49,820 --> 00:26:03,040
Yes. That's one option that I was thinking. And how this, you know.

152
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:08,170
Oh, I'm would like to make sure that people outside.

153
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:22,720
But you know when you look.

154
00:26:27,370 --> 00:27:13,860
Or I'm sending it at this point right now that. When you start downloading the Google update cycle and.

155
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:25,420
So this one is Europe. Yeah.

156
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:33,350
Same thing happened to me here. So. Oh, yeah.

157
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:38,730
It looks like it was a mistake, it seems. Yeah, well, no, it's not your fault.

158
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:56,979
No, no. Okay.

159
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:00,910
Carlos, looks like that worked okay on this one.

160
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:05,620
Okay. It seems that, you know, the users, if you have logged in in this machine before,

161
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:15,610
there was an existing profile and because of whatever happened with the power outage, it somehow corrupted the desktop.

162
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:20,200
And that's why you are able to log in. But nothing on the devices have responded.

163
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:26,020
So then that means that the assessment was ministrations when you took going in delete all the old profiles.

164
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:33,460
Uh huh. So when you log in, you will go through the brand new user profile and your profile will be set up properly.

165
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:38,080
Unfortunately, right now, it cannot be done during the course. Yeah, it takes some time.

166
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:42,850
Yeah. So you will switch to a different computer than it is previous.

167
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:47,230
And if there is no profile, if they use that machine previously.

168
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:53,950
Most likely there is a profile that because they last six months, I mean, they never used the they never used them was like,

169
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:59,970
yes, I've never used this and I've always but but we all just those computers.

170
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:04,950
I think it it probably will work okay. Because they usually sit in the same places.

171
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:09,550
So then as long as you are using a computer that you've never used before, most likely will work.

172
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:13,450
Oh, okay. So your credentials. I see.

173
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:19,270
So let's try to do this once again as administrator.

174
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:26,950
No, no, they're not going to know what you're doing.

175
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:55,480
So do you think you might try one or the computer?

176
00:29:56,740 --> 00:30:01,450
Some wonder some of the difficulty of trying to initiate this interview that you never used before.

177
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:10,320
I don't know if you have never been here, but in class that maybe.

178
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:19,480
Yeah, I think. I don't think you can do it.

179
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:26,530
I mean, are you interested in. Sorry. It's like switch places with.

180
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:37,120
And everyone is okay, was not able to see what would happen.

181
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:41,700
It's. It's not moving fast enough.

182
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:45,210
And the mistake was being able to move the machine just.

183
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:51,140
So let's put it this way. Oh, yeah.

184
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:59,780
Oh, yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.

185
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:05,270
But it is, it isn't plugged in or isn't is plugged into this negative or construction.

186
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:14,750
That's all I'm saying. Yeah. You're trying to push then there's the Internet is.

187
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:17,780
That's why we have this one. This does I have Internet. Yes.

188
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:23,720
Because for some reason they thought it might have come in and damage to the network for.

189
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,420
Continues and.

190
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:43,130
Yes and yes, I think it's up to the to the Labor Ministry so we can do something remotely after you've done the work around through the 93.

191
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:48,350
Okay. Because of greenhouse then I doubt if you can switch around to see if it works.

192
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:55,080
Yeah, I think it is safe to what? Yeah, it works.

193
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:58,790
It works for you at the moment. So.

194
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:07,110
I'll just go through the process of that, because if they haven't logged in for the first time,

195
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:10,950
they only want to get it a one because you provide that if you get it.

196
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:24,640
Thank you to everyone that was mentioning there just a little bit with this machine.

197
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:38,740
They said that they. Yeah.

198
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:43,610
I to know for that. But she doesn't know about the Internet.

199
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:48,130
Yes. Oh, you can either.

200
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,990
You cannot depend upon.

201
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:57,010
I know. Well, maybe.

202
00:32:57,010 --> 00:33:08,070
Maybe I. Thank you so much.

203
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:11,940
I remember that one.

204
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:35,750
Thank you. Okay.

205
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:41,160
Okay. Not working.

206
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,540
It's not working. But I don't know. I'm not open.

207
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:49,950
I don't know. So maybe at one point in the last month you use the machine.

208
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:53,430
Perhaps? Maybe. How about 15? 20?

209
00:33:55,410 --> 00:34:02,250
No, I mean, worst case scenario, you can use this one.

210
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:08,960
Yeah. No, I think it was the computer, too.

211
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:40,200
Who has been able to connect. I think most people, most people, most people either connecting or using their laptops.

212
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:47,080
So I think it is working, I think. And, you know, you are just not doing that because we have finals to do.

213
00:34:50,770 --> 00:35:05,300
I'm not. I think you can leave because, you know, you can work here because this one works.

214
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:11,420
Okay. If there's another one and there's another way to work right now, the very best one is still updating.

215
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:15,150
But the other one. Yes. And this one might work.

216
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:22,780
Right. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Cause if you need anything.

217
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:26,770
Okay, I will. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. All right.

218
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:40,430
Okay. Sorry about that. That was October. And especially the unintended consequences of shutting down middle schoolers.

219
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:46,840
Anyway, okay, so we were talking about the evaluation, so please don't put this in the evaluation system.

220
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:57,310
I feel less guilty, but no, I mean, please let me know what worked well and what you think that I could improve so far?

221
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:02,510
Kind of like next year. Always keep in mind that this this is a hard course.

222
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:06,409
I mean, this is remember, this is a course mandatory for the student.

223
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:10,520
So they're kind of like I. I know that he's been kind of lazy sometimes.

224
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:13,820
You've been a little maybe lost, but I really great actually.

225
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:17,989
So. So anyway, but tell me, what are the things that you feel like?

226
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:23,530
Oh, she will have kind of like a splendid in this other way, kind of like seeing a little more hourglass.

227
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:27,520
And it will be much easier for me because I'm happy to kind of like change things.

228
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:29,780
A review. Okay. Okay.

229
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:36,530
And then finally, a big thank you for being a wonderful class and for being so patient, particularly today, because it's been a nightmare.

230
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:40,370
So now let's go to review the exam together.

231
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:49,670
I know you already started, but I will be on. Okay, so this is let me put it in weaker.

232
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:04,690
Okay. So then. So I'm giving you some instructions.

233
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:08,259
Blue ribbon. So write your name. This is the owner custodian.

234
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:13,450
Right? Sign just adding your initials and the honor code statement below.

235
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:19,270
And the honor code is just to remind you that you are ethical people who don't want to teach.

236
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:24,969
Right? Then read the questions carefully, so with them at least twice.

237
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:29,680
Because sometimes your sentence questions have many questions and sometimes they are kind of like complex.

238
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,220
So read them carefully. You have plenty of time, believe me.

239
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:37,360
So bring them. Make make sure that you don't forget anything.

240
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:43,000
Right? Be clear and concise with your answers, particularly at the end,

241
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:48,910
which the two of you actually have some limited space to consider the need to write an essay.

242
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:55,780
I mean, it's just kind of like a relatively short I mean, not two lines, but not kind of like three pages.

243
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:59,020
Right. And laziest font size 12.

244
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:06,060
So don't try to put more kind of like information because you just minimize the font to

245
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:10,220
eight or something like that and don't use more space than they're saying four back to.

246
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:16,810
This is a take home to you. So you're starting to work on your own without consulting your classmates or friends.

247
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:21,280
And remember that you are Samuel Goldstein. Maybe you can consult me.

248
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,820
I mean, you are kind of like stuck with something that you are not sure about.

249
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:28,509
I'm happy to answer the clarify anything.

250
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:34,540
I'm not going to give you the answers clearly because this is the exam, but I'm happy to clarify things as much as possible.

251
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:39,540
And then you have to submit an electric version of the same as usually I said you already have the same meaning.

252
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:42,760
Canvas by 1 p.m. on Friday, December 16.

253
00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:48,310
So this is Your Honor code. And then part one is the analysis part, right?

254
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:54,340
So you have a randomly selected that I say the 405 cases of myocardial infarction

255
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:58,270
and 400 if like much population controlled from the Costa Rican heart study.

256
00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:01,600
You have work with this dataset before, right?

257
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:10,770
I mean, with all that kind of like parts of the dataset because the subsets of the larger original study that you're familiar with this study,

258
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:13,810
remember, this is a much case control study, right?

259
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:21,190
So because it's a much case control study later when you want to do anything, you have to take into account the matching factor.

260
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:23,919
You have to do conditional logistic regression where we reach that.

261
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:30,280
But I will remind you and it's in the detail instruction so that you don't forget is the same code that you have used before.

262
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:35,830
So this is not new. So the name of the dataset is called Final and in Canvas.

263
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:41,860
And the variables you have is this is kind of like really short that I said with just a few variables, right?

264
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:47,320
So then you have to kind of like get crazy finding the variables. So you have the 80 number which we are not going to use anyway.

265
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:51,700
You have to take that's calories from diet.

266
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:57,310
You have alpha linolenic acid from diet, you have 18 two trans fatty acids from diet.

267
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:06,400
And then you also have adipose tissue, alpha linolenic acid and adipose tissue of trans fatty acids.

268
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:10,690
So you have two fatty acids, alpha linolenic and trans fatty acids,

269
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:17,259
and then you have them in diet and in adipose tissue and you have work with these variables before.

270
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:21,370
So it's not kind of like it's super new and of course you have your own lifestyles.

271
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:28,360
So this is one that because you do it up a little, so you are going to have my God in question, you are zero.

272
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:34,690
You want to have the control and this is a single speed or matching, but I want to put it in just the listing.

273
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:39,640
Right. Okay. So the first part actually and be careful with that.

274
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:44,230
For the first part, you are going to work only with the controls.

275
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:47,380
Okay. So you have to subset that dataset, right?

276
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:51,580
So you need to kind of like do this.

277
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:56,379
Only among the controls are three equals zero, which you can do just great.

278
00:40:56,380 --> 00:41:04,540
I knew that. I said, would you say in your dress state and let us know every three equals zero, right?

279
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:12,309
So kind of like then you just give the, the ones that the know or you can say these three, these three equals one, then delete.

280
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:18,310
So then you delete all the cases and you just leave the controls. If someone is kind of like thinking, well, I'm not sure about that,

281
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:26,080
I'm happy to kind of like go around you now to show you how to do it, to make sure that you get your 405 control to me, like, okay,

282
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:30,670
so now you're going to why is that you are went to what were the controls because now the first

283
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:37,420
part we are going to look at only how those fatty acids relate to each of them they value and they

284
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:43,059
and the adipose tissue and we don't want to have myocardial infarction screwing up that rotation

285
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:47,740
that way we are getting rid of the on the in my case is why we are looking at the controls.

286
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:54,700
The controls are a representative sample of the Costa Rican population within much in fact, so that we focus on the controls.

287
00:41:55,510 --> 00:42:04,840
Now the first question is you have to check if adipose tissue are excessive and adipose tissue, trans fatty acids are good biomarkers of intake.

288
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:13,090
So basically you have to check either correlations between the 80% that you worry about are reasonably good, right, for each fatty acid.

289
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:19,510
But remember to work only with the control for this part and remember to page your test scores and relevant set up.

290
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,940
So again, once more,

291
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:31,389
don't forget to do this only in the center say look for it from your diet or anybody else because very skew but not very positive.

292
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:37,930
So variable. So I'm kind of like already in the past I gave you the option of do whatever you think that is, okay?

293
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:48,190
Now I'm going to that and you do that. So then everyone has the same results because right now this is just a side note that you're getting ignore,

294
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:55,270
but then somebody else is look a little weird. Kind of like when you transform it, it will look like a little bit more like this.

295
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:10,820
It is not a normal distribution, right? It looks like the government ignore that and imagine that this is going to be more like this.

296
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:17,660
So this is even after the measure we are witnessing now. It's a great moment, but it is not for the purposes of this.

297
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:25,440
As I say, this is okay because this is still better than the high rescue that you had before.

298
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,070
Transformation. That way I'm telling you to transform anyway.

299
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:34,520
Now, remember, you have to use power to get the coalition and it used to be some correlation coefficient.

300
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:39,560
So going on your system and then don't add any option, get used to normal proper.

301
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:45,800
Remember to copy your passport and copy the access output, which in this case is the correlation coefficient table.

302
00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:51,769
Right? And then write a sentence saying if adiposity is to alpha linolenic acid and adipose tissue

303
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:55,580
tertiary areas and good biomarkers of intake based on your correlation coefficient.

304
00:43:55,730 --> 00:44:00,080
Okay, you tell me yes is good or is moderately correlated.

305
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:03,110
Always have a correlation or whatever. Okay.

306
00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:08,200
So that's the first question. Okay.

307
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:13,520
Now, remember, this is the same as the labs that things are connected, right?

308
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,170
So kind of like in the second one.

309
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:27,020
So remember one, which is one of the things that come to your mind that when we were doing validation of frequency questionnaires,

310
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:31,480
which is in a way kind of like, I mean here we are not really evaluating, we are doing the other way around.

311
00:44:31,490 --> 00:44:39,049
There are anyway either the biomarker of let's well but we know that diet has a lot of measurement error by a lot

312
00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:46,190
of and kind of like and also we know that because of total energy intake there is a lot of extraneous radiation.

313
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:46,460
Right.

314
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:54,970
So then we want to adjust the dietary variable, right, total energy intake because we know that that's going in theory to improve our correlations.

315
00:44:54,980 --> 00:45:02,120
Right. We saw that before. Right? So now I'm asking you to adjust the dietary variables using the residual method.

316
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:07,160
That's why I can only talk. If there is anything I want you to remember is the residual method okay?

317
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:11,390
And so you get that received less and then you resent that.

318
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:20,300
And so and so now you will have new dietary variables that you go with of this renewable variation due to the calorie intake.

319
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:24,829
So now I want to repeat the correlation coefficients and in theory you should

320
00:45:24,830 --> 00:45:30,979
expect that they are going to be better in might be that they are not much better,

321
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:36,530
right. Because remember, this is really the reality that some things don't behave as well as you expect.

322
00:45:36,530 --> 00:45:39,860
But at least I mean, this is what you will use you have in mind, right?

323
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:46,340
So so I'm asking you to you can use the same that I said that you used before.

324
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:57,570
Only I'm under control and controlling them. Intimate. So I you the same that I said only I'm on the contract.

325
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:04,410
Okay. And I didn't vote for the two because of school and says output.

326
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:11,520
And now before do the correlation coefficient, I want you to compare the standard variation of digest.

327
00:46:11,550 --> 00:46:15,270
I mean, this is the I was jumping over to the first and the second question.

328
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:24,870
Yes, what to adjust for total Olympic. I went on to compare the total in the kind of like the receiver with the with the and adjusted.

329
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:30,540
And remember we already did that right and remember if you re the means are going to be more or less similar but the

330
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:37,470
standard deviations change like this and the deviations get lower when you remove that variation due to strange radiation.

331
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,950
So then you are going to compare to somebody you typically just did.

332
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:45,239
And then my guess is else has differences in the final variations, as you would expect.

333
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:53,720
Why you why not 50? That should be right. So once more don't forget to do this only among controls.

334
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:58,770
You don't have to agree with that. I said again, because you already did it in the in the previous step.

335
00:46:58,770 --> 00:47:04,180
But I'm just remind you that you will need to use I once use the low pressure on the

336
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:09,850
variables and then you need not also the fact that the trans look that I found that I should

337
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:17,790
look like more like a couple of other but that is normal enough I love different calories

338
00:47:17,790 --> 00:47:23,300
to to do that to you by so it will be the same adjustment that you have been doing before.

339
00:47:23,310 --> 00:47:24,450
Right. So that I mean,

340
00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:32,339
this is for you to kind of like not having problems doing the doctors regression understanding because this is what you been doing using their Newton

341
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:41,850
illustration and the calories low pressure to foil this that you have used before to get the receiver that is in those lines that I show you.

342
00:47:41,850 --> 00:47:46,760
And then I mean, you have done that, both of those. So those are the two buffers.

343
00:47:46,770 --> 00:47:51,749
One, you said that those see the same as we have done before, copy of Haskell and copy the size upward,

344
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:55,170
which in this case is there means they will have digested and digested.

345
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:59,610
Right. Right. And they complex and abbreviations and the assemblage of gestures.

346
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:04,260
Okay. So these are kind of like the things you have to do in this in this.

347
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:15,960
Okay. So now that we have the residuals, the dietary variables, we have just defaulted and now we are going to repeat the correlations.

348
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:24,900
So, so now J The correlations again of the calorie adjusted dietary variables with the adipose variables and keep working on the

349
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:31,979
controls only for this part based your consensus output and are the conditions better or worse compared to using then adjusted.

350
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:38,460
But I was you see the what you were expecting by or why not? I mean I'm telling you when you know that in theory they should be better, right?

351
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:45,059
Because we are removing extraneous variation, right? So again, don't forget to do this in the controls and then you don't have to deal with it.

352
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:52,410
I said, I guess we use the previous one, but don't forget that he ate here recently.

353
00:48:52,410 --> 00:48:56,309
So that's the thing. Now you don't need to lock transferring your library, right?

354
00:48:56,310 --> 00:49:02,900
I want to because your recently received the working theory, they're supposed to be normally distributed the positively,

355
00:49:03,450 --> 00:49:08,399
which I can tell you that it's not totally true because as I said, not normally.

356
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:16,379
So I mean, this is one kind of like interesting lesson is like if you're if you're looking for a variable,

357
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:20,120
it doesn't look that we see that it may not be normally there.

358
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:27,190
So now we are violating a little bit the assumption of the linear regression, but we are going to know that for the purposes of this survey.

359
00:49:27,210 --> 00:49:31,860
So then because of that, we are going to use the resources that you are assuming that we are not many.

360
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:37,259
This is right. So they use properties in the operation completions using person copy,

361
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:42,870
access code and copy the downside sample with this again, the new correlation coefficient table with the receiver.

362
00:49:43,470 --> 00:49:47,040
Okay. And instead of the requesters. Okay, so far so good.

363
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:50,790
So now we will just validating adiposity.

364
00:49:50,790 --> 00:49:55,410
So and as a biomarker of dietary intake for these two fatty acids.

365
00:49:56,100 --> 00:50:01,830
Now, now a question for we are switching gears.

366
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:05,460
Right. So now we are going to go back to the whole dataset.

367
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:10,740
So now you can go back to your original classic find that the has both the cases and the controls.

368
00:50:10,830 --> 00:50:14,640
Okay. So now we are going to explore the association between adiposity.

369
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:19,320
So this is not diet, this is adipose tissue, alpha, linolenic acid, a myocardial infarction.

370
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:27,180
And we are going to use the whole dataset with both cases and controls. So we are going to run a logistic model which is a conditional logistic model.

371
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:30,719
Remember, because this isn't much control study for adiposity.

372
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:33,930
So folic acid and then the variable is a continuous variable.

373
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:41,670
So you are going to integrate the variable as it is B in the model series, you don't have to do any quintiles or any categorization, right?

374
00:50:42,570 --> 00:50:47,430
And you have to interpret the odds ratio that you get out of that right based on your source code.

375
00:50:47,430 --> 00:50:53,100
And this s output with the odds ratio. Now, don't forget that now you are using the whole dataset.

376
00:50:53,220 --> 00:51:02,640
Okay. Use logistic and don't forget to use Vegas and then option as you use always to get your model modeling the probability of being against.

377
00:51:02,650 --> 00:51:07,650
If you don't use it as an option, you forget for whatever reason, then you are able to model the probability of a control.

378
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:14,809
So there you will get inverse ratios, which is the one that I use adequately, sort of unique at this point.

379
00:51:14,810 --> 00:51:21,510
Sure. So this is be free. I don't use die. If you remember, this is a much to a study.

380
00:51:21,630 --> 00:51:28,260
Therefore you have to write conditional release the relationship. You need to include your extraneous theming with a matching factor variable.

381
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:34,110
Therefore, as you did before, you have done it with a copy of the scope of the analysis output.

382
00:51:34,710 --> 00:51:37,920
To your observation, they want and interpret the literature properly.

383
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:42,510
Use the template. Remember you, the DMP. So keep the watch.

384
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:47,980
Okay, I'll follow any case here.

385
00:51:47,990 --> 00:51:51,600
This supposed to be a good foundation, right? Is an omega three fatty acid.

386
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:58,379
A if you remember from previous in title you was highly protective in Costa Rica.

387
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:04,740
So then you're going to get a loss ratio that is protective. So that that remember that makes the position a little tricky.

388
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:07,800
We could use the one minus whatever to say.

389
00:52:08,430 --> 00:52:12,180
The odds of this is decreased by 30% or whatever.

390
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:15,749
Right. Okay.

391
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:20,040
So now we are going to do the same, but with that variable.

392
00:52:20,130 --> 00:52:23,700
Okay, so now we're going to run and these models are simple.

393
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:25,620
I mean, you don't have to adjust for anything.

394
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:31,050
I mean, if you are still conditioning on the matching factor but you're not entering anything else in the model, right?

395
00:52:31,470 --> 00:52:38,130
So now you are going to run a logistic model for dietary alpha linolenic acid, the regional variable not they adjusted for calories.

396
00:52:38,250 --> 00:52:39,209
The regional variable,

397
00:52:39,210 --> 00:52:45,570
the one that you get from the the rest is three four under the USA and again whatever for continuous one should you going to have

398
00:52:45,570 --> 00:52:51,270
to kind of like gather all this or whatever and then you have to interpret the odds ratio and base your Haskell and test output.

399
00:52:51,690 --> 00:52:59,490
So again, remember we are now working with the hope that I, if there might be four is the same thing but now you are using that you have

400
00:53:00,030 --> 00:53:03,990
a control anyhow we use from the U.S. to not forget that this is an option.

401
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:07,980
Now your body one is this one exceed one in three.

402
00:53:08,590 --> 00:53:16,229
Okay, remember, this is a much better study. So you have to understand the standard copy or since both of them are just the

403
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:19,780
average that they want and they interpret the future properly using the benefits.

404
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:24,479
Okay. Okay.

405
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:31,050
So now. I'm giving you the hint of which you are respecting.

406
00:53:31,950 --> 00:53:33,750
As you can see from your results,

407
00:53:34,410 --> 00:53:42,330
you will see that the Association of Dietary Alpha goes in the opposite direction that they want for adipose tissue alpha linoleic acid.

408
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:47,280
So I'm giving you a hint. If you look different, please check your analysis because there is something wrong.

409
00:53:47,310 --> 00:53:54,330
Okay, so you are going to see that adipose is protected by diet is has an increase of ratio.

410
00:53:54,390 --> 00:54:00,230
Okay. Even if it's not significant, remove it because it may not be significant.

411
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:08,160
That is not protective or necessary. So now I'm asking you, what do you think is likely to be the main reason for these contradictory results?

412
00:54:10,050 --> 00:54:16,230
And is there anything that you can do in your analysis to get results more similar to the ones that you got with the adipose variable,

413
00:54:16,230 --> 00:54:24,770
a protective association? Right. So the idea there may be more than one reason, but there's some indication that there may be more than one reason.

414
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:30,030
So come up with a potential reason for the discrepancies and perform that analysis.

415
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:33,179
Right. So you think that, oh, you should adjust for this, right?

416
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:40,010
Or then kind of like do it right. Or maybe it's because of other reasons and then do whatever you can possibly use in his analysis.

417
00:54:40,470 --> 00:54:44,010
You may come up with other stuff, but there's one there.

418
00:54:44,370 --> 00:54:51,659
Don't forget to do this. And that is again to remember that you will have to write your secret in and that is a much less controlled study.

419
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:58,830
So this is the same. So this is the same as we've done before. This is the maybe the a little trickier question.

420
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:02,280
But I, I think you can come up with it where there is.

421
00:55:04,590 --> 00:55:12,290
Okay. So that's actually the analysis, which is not a lot, but I think I think you can even finish in the time we still have glass probably.

422
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:21,210
So why don't you do the the analysis, then you have these three questions.

423
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:30,060
So there are three of them. So the first question say you've just go to my comments on that paper that you

424
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:34,530
submitted regarding the relation between dietary fat intake and risk of ischemia,

425
00:55:34,530 --> 00:55:41,340
a stroke. Right. And then it happens that the reviewers, for whatever reason, apparently had no idea what was c loss of total fat mean.

426
00:55:41,370 --> 00:55:46,259
Maybe they are not immunologists. They're in another field and they haven't heard about the risk of loss.

427
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:55,920
Right. So remember when you submit a paper and a regular study about what is this, then you have to provide an answer kind of like that.

428
00:55:56,660 --> 00:56:03,270
They they understand exactly what you are doing. So would you explain to the reviewers what the results are?

429
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:11,700
Why do you want to calculate the residuals and where are all their alternative methods to adjust for total energy intake?

430
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:17,999
Right. And remember, this is an open note up in book exam.

431
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:24,270
So you can go to the slides and and check everything. When we were talking about methyl something and take that information from that.

432
00:56:24,270 --> 00:56:29,550
Right, but just put it together in a way that that will answer the three questions.

433
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:34,410
Okay. So focus on the three questions.

434
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:40,590
So those are the three questions. Please don't write more than the space in this page and you can even write it.

435
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:48,509
So this is this page that you have, which is enough to answer, and you can even write half you want.

436
00:56:48,510 --> 00:56:54,960
I mean, don't be superbly briefly, right. But kind of like again, you have to write an essay just unsolicited.

437
00:56:55,530 --> 00:57:05,760
Okay. Now, the second one is actually the more kind of like you have been kind of like asking this question.

438
00:57:05,910 --> 00:57:13,709
And if that is so plain, why total energy intake is an important variable in nutritional epidemiology studies and what

439
00:57:13,710 --> 00:57:18,510
are the main reasons to digest for total intake when in studying diet this is associated?

440
00:57:18,510 --> 00:57:27,239
You already had this question in your lab. So I'm just gonna give one example of a diet.

441
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:32,010
This is association in which you should not adjust for the energy intake and explain why.

442
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:36,659
And this I mean, there are a few. Right. So then you can choose the one.

443
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:41,160
I mean, we mentioned at least two in glass, but you may find another one, right?

444
00:57:41,190 --> 00:57:47,370
So that that's okay. I mean, focus on the three main reasons for adjusting for that energy intake.

445
00:57:48,690 --> 00:57:54,030
Give me one example. When you should not adjust on this plane, why don't forget this plane way.

446
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:57,630
And again, don't write more than this space in this page.

447
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:02,340
And you can write this because you don't need so much space.

448
00:58:03,630 --> 00:58:11,310
And the last one is the last one is also kind of like you have already answered that in a way in your lab.

449
00:58:11,310 --> 00:58:15,690
So dietary intake questionnaires are often validated by comparing nutrient intake

450
00:58:15,690 --> 00:58:19,379
estimates with biomarkers of dietary intake using correlation coefficient,

451
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:27,750
for example, right? So at least four reasons why discrepancies may exist between intake estimates and biomarkers.

452
00:58:27,750 --> 00:58:32,190
So basically why the biomarkers may not captured world that drink.

453
00:58:32,310 --> 00:58:38,750
Right. And we we you can go back to this lecture of biomarkers and do that and tell

454
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:43,049
your whole world because no way you already answered that list for reasons.

455
00:58:43,050 --> 00:58:46,920
And please don't write more on this and that's it.

456
00:58:47,250 --> 00:58:57,100
So this is not a lung exam and it's basically touching on the main competency that I wanted you I wanted you to reach in this in this in this course.

457
00:58:58,530 --> 00:59:05,190
Now, I'm not giving you the SAS code, but is this actually the same SAS code that you had been using before?

458
00:59:05,490 --> 00:59:11,320
But if there is anything that I mean, I think maybe the subset of the dataset or whatever, I guess I'm here to help.

459
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:16,410
Okay, so, so now you need to go to the writer and you can go.

460
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:22,920
If not, we still have 50 minutes here that you can start working and make sure that you understand everything.

461
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:25,480
Okay? Okay.
