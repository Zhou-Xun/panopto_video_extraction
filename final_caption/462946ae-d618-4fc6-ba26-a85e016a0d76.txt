1
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:21,320
Jay. good afternoon everyone. I should be here. I'm looking

2
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:26,360
forward to this class. I hope we'll be doing some interesting exciting things are

3
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:33,500
in it and that you'll enjoy it. so as you can see my name is Thomas Robin.

4
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:39,780
if you got salad Don's in public so I have five minutes if you look at the very end of the syllabus.

5
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:47,360
I had a long briefing about me but I'll give you the short version. so

6
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,500
medical doctor and also if you feel that the genealogy. I actually came here

7
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:58,080
doing occupational medicine residency. everyone sitting down. that was in

8
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:03,169
nineteen eighty two. when I arrived here and. so anyway have

9
00:01:03,169 --> 00:01:08,529
grandma and then I did the residency

10
00:01:08,529 --> 00:01:13,589
and I stayed here a member faculty. and originally I was all focused on

11
00:01:13,589 --> 00:01:18,749
the on workplace studies and outpatient study. but then starting up in the late

12
00:01:18,749 --> 00:01:23,849
nineties. I also started doing a_lot_of work on community and environmental studies as

13
00:01:23,849 --> 00:01:28,989
well. and I'm outside. bye. for example we we've been involved

14
00:01:28,989 --> 00:01:34,049
with a series of studies in Detroit. looking at both

15
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:39,269
outdoor ambient air pollution as well as indoor air pollution and activation of asthma

16
00:01:39,269 --> 00:01:45,229
and children. which is a very big issue in Detroit and

17
00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:50,809
what I've done all kinds of occupational studies a_lot_of things are done actually

18
00:01:50,809 --> 00:01:55,889
in recent years been in mine in a couple of studies involving looking at Tory help.

19
00:01:55,889 --> 00:02:00,989
call nine recently in the US but then

20
00:02:00,989 --> 00:02:05,989
I actually got involved in starting in South Africa. and I guess another thing I should tell you

21
00:02:05,989 --> 00:02:11,809
to give you sort of background about myself that. I have been

22
00:02:11,809 --> 00:02:17,289
sent about the early nineteen nineties been very involved with work and sub Sahara in Africa

23
00:02:17,289 --> 00:02:23,429
as well. worked on both occupational and environmental health and actually

24
00:02:23,429 --> 00:02:28,429
a_lot_of work around training people and occupational and environmental health

25
00:02:28,429 --> 00:02:33,529
and low and middle income country and thoughts here in Africa.

26
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:38,849
especially not entirely but we we try more probably but especially around research

27
00:02:38,849 --> 00:02:44,469
and how to do research studies. and so I'm really I'm very

28
00:02:44,469 --> 00:02:50,049
interested in. keeping about to pass the strengthening in law in middle income countries

29
00:02:50,049 --> 00:02:55,141
which I tend to call Alan my see case I forget to say that again recently

30
00:02:55,141 --> 00:03:00,221
people called. the third world. I'm going to how that happened that I called. I call Alan

31
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:05,301
I see developing countries and then somebody went out on not all of them are developing.

32
00:03:05,301 --> 00:03:11,081
so well and so these days if you're sort of in the know you're happy about

33
00:03:11,081 --> 00:03:16,101
global health issues. people usually referred to this loan.

34
00:03:16,101 --> 00:03:22,281
so in the backpack for sure for five actually the director of Public Health

35
00:03:22,281 --> 00:03:27,421
school. actually before the.

36
00:03:27,421 --> 00:03:32,461
Matt Bolton. so that very briefly a little bit about

37
00:03:32,461 --> 00:03:38,761
my background and

38
00:03:38,761 --> 00:03:44,381
that is big enough to read. well you got on your screen probably but that's figure out the rewrite.

39
00:03:44,381 --> 00:03:50,341
so give me a try. e-mail address. if you do send me an e-mail

40
00:03:50,341 --> 00:03:55,561
but it said that there. this is sort of important because I get seriously in and dated with

41
00:03:55,561 --> 00:04:00,841
e-mails. please make sure that it starts in the subject line with

42
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:06,041
EH. six zero three. because I'll have those automatically go

43
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:11,721
somewhere else and I'll I'll remember to look. if you don't mind. if you don't put that in for your subject line.

44
00:04:11,721 --> 00:04:17,321
I'm like with them. that's my warning to you. okay.

45
00:04:17,321 --> 00:04:22,321
and that's it if you really get desperate on responding your e-mail don't.

46
00:04:22,321 --> 00:04:27,321
it's office hours by appointment but if you're really desperate. you can always come

47
00:04:27,321 --> 00:04:33,381
by and knock on the door. I'm usually in there. even if I have no interest.

48
00:04:33,381 --> 00:04:38,741
okay. see the next thing it's on there. I actually

49
00:04:38,741 --> 00:04:43,841
this past time you gave to. Doctor Anthony Burton and I

50
00:04:43,841 --> 00:04:48,901
asked the team of court and we're I think we're very complimentary. he's also as

51
00:04:48,901 --> 00:04:54,041
you can see and in the MGH your classes and pH from here.. actually went to the occupational.

52
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:59,433
this is in residency here but I like myself. you know academics.

53
00:04:59,433 --> 00:05:05,033
he's a practicing occupational physician. he actually works for General_Motors.

54
00:05:05,033 --> 00:05:10,173
and so you know I see workers with health problems and so on so he brings up.

55
00:05:10,173 --> 00:05:15,373
been part of your perspective. the other thing I

56
00:05:15,373 --> 00:05:20,413
wanna I enjoyed working with him. is that unlike some people

57
00:05:20,413 --> 00:05:26,093
I know who decided they're gonna work for a large multinational companies like General_Motors.

58
00:05:26,093 --> 00:05:31,493
he seemed to. what I would describe it all fixed.

59
00:05:31,493 --> 00:05:36,613
with respect to it. you know the patient comes first. you wanna make sure whatever you're doing

60
00:05:36,613 --> 00:05:41,693
is actually in the interest of the person you're seen. and if there's some conflict between

61
00:05:41,693 --> 00:05:46,693
what management is interested in and what you think is best for worker that

62
00:05:46,693 --> 00:05:52,753
you really have_to go to work. so I think I love about him. he.

63
00:05:52,753 --> 00:05:57,755
even though he's he's there we're this is the on the going pressure sometimes people say

64
00:05:57,755 --> 00:06:02,935
well I just thought some corners here we don't that's really happened. three bit early. so he's

65
00:06:02,935 --> 00:06:08,115
he's great person and he brings that you know different type of perspective as well. so

66
00:06:08,115 --> 00:06:13,375
probably he's this is Jeff Fletcher. it's probably only going to shippers

67
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:18,575
and I apologize. he's probably only going to

68
00:06:18,575 --> 00:06:23,695
be able to get maybe three or four lectures over the program. so when we get this

69
00:06:23,695 --> 00:06:28,935
last year. this is I don't know why I wasn't like confession but I did the course last

70
00:06:28,935 --> 00:06:34,035
year because he wanted to teach in it. we ran the course from

71
00:06:34,035 --> 00:06:40,111
four thirty p.m. to six p.m.. too bad you didn't mention to you late here till this year

72
00:06:40,111 --> 00:06:45,251
and we we got some feedback about that. at

73
00:06:45,251 --> 00:06:50,711
the end of the term about you know we're too tired. so I like that

74
00:06:50,711 --> 00:06:56,111
and so I like said to Tony I said well we're gonna have_to offer this at a more reasonable

75
00:06:56,111 --> 00:07:01,251
hour and it's it's better with people schedules. so here we are. the downside is that you all

76
00:07:01,251 --> 00:07:06,551
can come. thank you. to talk. but that's really good news

77
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:12,051
is the bottom thing here. is I just talked to my department chair

78
00:07:12,051 --> 00:07:17,091
which I assume all you know it's Craig here. so maybe maybe

79
00:07:17,091 --> 00:07:22,111
not everyone in this room and what not and he said yes

80
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:27,151
we're going to get you Jesus for this course. so I hope the best I

81
00:07:27,151 --> 00:07:32,251
can. I had trouble getting an agreement. as you can tell you that. I

82
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:37,302
don't know maybe I finally we talked about. so anyway not sure we'll have a person place bye

83
00:07:37,302 --> 00:07:42,502
Tuesday but I should certainly hope I returned today we have a person you have someone out to work

84
00:07:42,502 --> 00:07:47,522
with and come to on that. as you probably know how this works. there

85
00:07:47,522 --> 00:07:52,742
has been an application that goes out and I will probably interview the people looked the strong

86
00:07:52,742 --> 00:07:57,942
offer to someone and see if they accept it. so hopefully go out. they might be here by Tuesday. probably

87
00:07:57,942 --> 00:08:03,902
by Thursday which is good. I need someone to help me keep track. thanks.

88
00:08:03,902 --> 00:08:15,482
okay.

89
00:08:15,482 --> 00:08:22,922
okay. so this is Don from the sale of it. it's all natural in the middle.

90
00:08:22,922 --> 00:08:28,042
the course is going to use. what we're doing right now which is the live lecture

91
00:08:28,042 --> 00:08:33,202
presentation. but Robin. thank you Tom. like Sherry's

92
00:08:33,202 --> 00:08:38,204
present presentations that were done last year know that

93
00:08:38,204 --> 00:08:43,524
for some other time. actually I hope the significant part of the time are gonna end up asking

94
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:48,944
you to view the lecture before we have the class.

95
00:08:48,944 --> 00:08:54,324
that's about that subject matter. and the reason I wanna do that is.

96
00:08:54,324 --> 00:08:59,384
which we didn't do nearly as much as I would've liked to have last year. I

97
00:08:59,384 --> 00:09:04,984
wanna make this class. bunch more interesting and much more interactive

98
00:09:04,984 --> 00:09:10,164
and hopefully give you sort of interesting scenarios and interesting questions

99
00:09:10,164 --> 00:09:15,984
that are relevant lectures just watched it and probably actually ask you

100
00:09:15,984 --> 00:09:21,064
on the discussion thread to give you sort of first thoughts about it. so that so that everybody when they

101
00:09:21,064 --> 00:09:26,604
come in the class very spent some time thinking about that and then

102
00:09:26,604 --> 00:09:32,004
I'm hoping for a lively discussion in class. I think that probably

103
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:37,802
much better way to learn. what I'm doing right now. maybe up and talking. so that's

104
00:09:37,802 --> 00:09:43,022
that's what I plan to do it. try to have a very substantial part of the course.

105
00:09:43,022 --> 00:09:52,402
we organized that way. so I'm sorry about doing that.

106
00:09:52,402 --> 00:09:58,622
yeah. well it's all up there. but just basically want what I want to see about that slide.

107
00:09:58,622 --> 00:10:03,682
okay. in terms of the parts department this is on two pages by the way.

108
00:10:03,682 --> 00:10:08,702
it's course in the sale of it. so you're

109
00:10:08,702 --> 00:10:13,882
it. this is what I have here what you're actually gonna be graded on. so

110
00:10:13,882 --> 00:10:19,382
you can be graded on to the patient in three different ways.

111
00:10:19,382 --> 00:10:24,622
first of all whether you are here attending the class.

112
00:10:24,622 --> 00:10:29,642
unless you have bona_fide excuse before hand why you can't be in the class of

113
00:10:29,642 --> 00:10:34,722
course and you be forgiven for not physically being here in the class. now having said

114
00:10:34,722 --> 00:10:39,944
that when you can't physically be here in the class my plan is to

115
00:10:39,944 --> 00:10:45,064
in every case record it on. can opt out and then this is also

116
00:10:45,064 --> 00:10:50,304
on the syllabus and have it posted. hopefully with well. I think usually

117
00:10:50,304 --> 00:10:55,484
within twenty four hours but certainly less than seventy two hours. so that if for some reason you can physically

118
00:10:55,484 --> 00:11:00,684
be present. you can still see what we do during the class. and that's why instead of just

119
00:11:00,684 --> 00:11:05,844
putting out the word document. I had to take the changed to PC. this

120
00:11:05,844 --> 00:11:10,904
is this is a better way to do it but I changed it to PDF. I said

121
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:16,284
I might snap shot of this and I paid it into a PowerPoint file

122
00:11:16,284 --> 00:11:21,324
which you looking at. the reason I did that is. if you records on a Hannah. so the

123
00:11:21,324 --> 00:11:26,424
only thing that people can see is PowerPoint presentation. so

124
00:11:26,424 --> 00:11:31,744
you don't see it in Power Point. hi everyone very familiar with this which again

125
00:11:31,744 --> 00:11:37,450
is the voice over synchronize with the power point. so you don't get to see if I

126
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:42,550
potentially we're just yours but other than that I'll be in the office. give

127
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:47,570
me a questions. okay. so be in

128
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:54,990
classes one thing. the next to purchase a patient. I'm gonna do this

129
00:11:54,990 --> 00:12:00,650
for some of the presentations at all. so they're

130
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:05,810
gonna have short. which I think whenever you

131
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:11,110
go in several ways wanted that sort of it's gonna direct you to what we thought

132
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:16,110
was most important in a lecture and make sure that you that you understood that. that you can

133
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:22,750
respond to her and say you know here's what I think is the answer. I will still be organized bottle choice.

134
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:28,030
we don't wanna get in. having to read it. I don't know right away. when you finish it what you what you got

135
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:33,210
writing that you got quote unquote wrong. so

136
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:38,840
it's a way to test yourself and see if you understood what you heard just heard about it looked at

137
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:44,140
and I think also you know a_lot_of quick questions.

138
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:49,140
we'll have similarities of kinda questions you can get on the mid term exam and the final exam. I think

139
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:54,280
for to give you a little more practical prep to prepare you for taking the exams as well.

140
00:12:54,280 --> 00:13:00,160
so I'm not gonna do that each and every single presentations. this one

141
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:05,400
but I quite a few quizzes and just

142
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:10,480
so you know. anything that happens. I cannot the reason I'm gonna get

143
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,560
a GSI. we then we will

144
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:21,266
send out an announcement or something out.

145
00:13:21,266 --> 00:13:26,546
that will be posted on the campus site. and you will be automatically e-mailed

146
00:13:26,546 --> 00:13:31,846
about. there's something new for you to look at the campus site. I'm assuming by now

147
00:13:31,846 --> 00:13:37,006
everyone in this room is much more experienced candidate. I have because I did everything

148
00:13:37,006 --> 00:13:42,386
thing my life and see two oh. until last time and I have this like technically

149
00:13:42,386 --> 00:13:49,866
unbelievably Roy GSI last time. I didn't learn happy darn thing about

150
00:13:49,866 --> 00:13:55,226
that part. I got here a little bit late. okay.

151
00:13:55,226 --> 00:14:00,266
so at your part to do the quizzes. there are graded cleaning. if

152
00:14:00,266 --> 00:14:05,286
you did play. I'm hoping you would do this is do things randomly to get it over

153
00:14:05,286 --> 00:14:10,546
with. okay. hey this is an answer. bye. you don't get a grade. so if you get them all right

154
00:14:10,546 --> 00:14:15,786
or all wrong or in between. that's not the point the point is the Jackson like problem.

155
00:14:15,786 --> 00:14:21,627
okay. so animal last participation is

156
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:26,887
when you're when you'll be asked to submit discussion draft responses.

157
00:14:26,887 --> 00:14:32,387
I usually get selected reading. now this particular case. I notice this is already

158
00:14:32,387 --> 00:14:37,547
because I just got posted. bye. this is discuss a discussion thread

159
00:14:37,547 --> 00:14:42,827
because of this week. it wasn't sent out ahead of time and I'm gonna show you what their

160
00:14:42,827 --> 00:14:49,107
buys in the mail and then let's see.

161
00:14:49,107 --> 00:14:54,247
alright. so that's that's the three big kids patient items and together they

162
00:14:54,247 --> 00:14:59,607
add up to eighteen percent of your grade. there's gonna be two.

163
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:04,847
so my detailed homework. one of them is gonna be on issues

164
00:15:04,847 --> 00:15:10,107
around Palm vacation. which is happy. especially when looking

165
00:15:10,107 --> 00:15:15,327
at doing a_lot_of study but you the gold standard if you wanna figure out whether to keep our

166
00:15:15,327 --> 00:15:20,843
exposure is called in a particular disease in Kim and

167
00:15:20,843 --> 00:15:26,023
pretty much that means you gotta look it up in the office Monday. I'm sure you know and

168
00:15:26,023 --> 00:15:31,043
so I assume everyone's also familiar with. there's always issues

169
00:15:31,043 --> 00:15:36,343
about. well you might find it in the association. but how would you

170
00:15:36,343 --> 00:15:41,523
how would you go about thinking about whether that association is likely to be called or not. which

171
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:46,583
is obviously very important questions now and arena. and which that question

172
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:52,483
comes up. you might not have dealt with so much in another genealogy class.

173
00:15:52,483 --> 00:16:00,143
everybody in here. either taking or have taken everything out I gonna show a hand.

174
00:16:00,143 --> 00:16:06,143
not quite everybody but most people. alright. so

175
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:11,543
one of the places. this is a question because ration five is when I

176
00:16:11,543 --> 00:16:16,603
when you in doctor patient relationship or condition of any sort. patient

177
00:16:16,603 --> 00:16:22,283
relationship. so so you see an individual

178
00:16:22,283 --> 00:16:27,803
in your trial and you're trying to make it diagnose it. what's wrong with that individual

179
00:16:27,803 --> 00:16:33,283
so that you can offer the best possible treatment. bye. and of course it is important part of that

180
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:38,763
is trying to decide whether the person's problem is possibly related

181
00:16:38,763 --> 00:16:44,023
to something. they've been exposed to work or sometimes we actually end up seeing

182
00:16:44,023 --> 00:16:49,283
people who have exposures in that in marginal environment

183
00:16:49,283 --> 00:16:54,443
and you have_to figure out whether you think it's probably related and it's

184
00:16:54,443 --> 00:16:59,463
that it's a different way of thinking about doing. just thinking about it happened Sunday and of course with those

185
00:16:59,463 --> 00:17:04,903
and all of that. is it a_lot_of thought about whether the scientific

186
00:17:04,903 --> 00:17:09,983
literature say. I believe that really study well done today. actually real out

187
00:17:09,983 --> 00:17:15,143
potential Gonzales et_cetera et_cetera but we get the five

188
00:17:15,143 --> 00:17:20,365
individual that was so much different situation which requires son

189
00:17:20,365 --> 00:17:25,465
and even higher standard of understanding what's going on. to come to the right conclusion but

190
00:17:25,465 --> 00:17:31,365
it's obviously critically important for that individual. but that's the right conclusion

191
00:17:31,365 --> 00:17:36,485
and whether you do the right thing. for example you don't wanna tell. if

192
00:17:36,485 --> 00:17:41,565
you are a clinician. you don't wanna suggest to someone that they need to leave a job

193
00:17:41,565 --> 00:17:46,725
which which they you know how to do well and pays well and they may not be able to find another job

194
00:17:46,725 --> 00:17:51,965
nearly as good as that job. they have_to go looking for another job. you don't tell

195
00:17:51,965 --> 00:17:57,865
him that. if you're wrong about the idea that the job can change into their disease process

196
00:17:57,865 --> 00:18:03,165
and of course vice_versa. you don't wanna miss the fact that there

197
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:08,325
was exposure on the job is actually possibly okay with it because it's probably gonna

198
00:18:08,325 --> 00:18:13,465
happen is you even if you try to treat them with the standard treatment that again better likely end

199
00:18:13,465 --> 00:18:18,539
getting worse over time. say somebody has asthma from where what

200
00:18:18,539 --> 00:18:23,579
they're said to type to it specifically something at work. you

201
00:18:23,579 --> 00:18:29,139
can give them last year right. you know it's very standard treatment for asthma. but

202
00:18:29,139 --> 00:18:34,339
usually it's not gonna improve very much. if they continue you know going to work five or six

203
00:18:34,339 --> 00:18:39,399
days a week and having the same exposure that's causing the problem. if there's other reasons I don't going

204
00:18:39,399 --> 00:18:44,599
to now that it's very important to be right about that particular diagnosis. but the point is that

205
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:50,519
you always have_to think about whether whether you believe things are possibly associated

206
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:55,659
and that when it narrowed down to advice to one individual.

207
00:18:55,659 --> 00:19:01,119
you can see for both health and such economic reasons. it's really critical.

208
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:06,999
okay. I hope I've convinced you that.

209
00:19:06,999 --> 00:19:12,159
so that's one and then homework too. it's more about

210
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:17,197
design and interpretation occupational health study actually think

211
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:22,277
we might use in environmental health and in this case. and I'll be

212
00:19:22,277 --> 00:19:29,077
in another written assignment. so

213
00:19:29,077 --> 00:19:34,417
I assume everyone is familiar with. maybe you are national ambient

214
00:19:34,417 --> 00:19:39,477
air quality standards and EPA is responsible for for accommodating

215
00:19:39,477 --> 00:19:47,197
and forcing in United_States. so those standards.

216
00:19:47,197 --> 00:19:52,637
you don't wanna make a mistake with those standard either because you don't want people expose the things unnecessarily

217
00:19:52,637 --> 00:19:57,725
that actually in help with higher levels and they should be. but on the other hand you

218
00:19:57,725 --> 00:20:03,045
don't wanted to man. such a low level. that is gonna literally hot.

219
00:20:03,045 --> 00:20:08,485
whoever industry. sometimes government potentially billions

220
00:20:08,485 --> 00:20:13,685
and billions of dollars are coming in compliance with maybe there's not gonna be much of it further impact

221
00:20:13,685 --> 00:20:18,925
and improving house. bye. they got potential tension. so we're gonna look

222
00:20:18,925 --> 00:20:23,985
at sort of one of the key story. when

223
00:20:23,985 --> 00:20:30,425
basically when EPA decided. okay.

224
00:20:30,425 --> 00:20:36,405
we think we need to lower their standard ticket matter.

225
00:20:36,405 --> 00:20:41,445
for for two p.m. ten p.m. two. five. what and you know they have_to have this

226
00:20:41,445 --> 00:20:46,645
huge review of the whole literature and why are we saying we wanna change this and lower the standards. and

227
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:51,825
so this is we're gonna we're gonna have_to you look very carefully about the TV study. like to that

228
00:20:51,825 --> 00:20:57,012
decision at that time. so it's kinda interesting. every you know almost

229
00:20:57,012 --> 00:21:02,152
everything in occupational grandma house and someone who turns out the controversial but it's

230
00:21:02,152 --> 00:21:07,593
controversial. that's it. this has huge impact economically. in terms of what

231
00:21:07,593 --> 00:21:12,672
needed to be done. okay. so then the mid term

232
00:21:12,672 --> 00:21:17,813
exam is gonna be twenty percent. what we're gonna do.

233
00:21:17,813 --> 00:21:23,193
it's gonna be. I'll give you lots of details about later but it's gonna be a combination of short answer.

234
00:21:23,193 --> 00:21:28,693
which means mostly multiple choice. and I'm sorry.

235
00:21:28,693 --> 00:21:34,733
the monthly multiple choice. you know where it is. you have_to pick one answer

236
00:21:34,733 --> 00:21:39,912
and answer the short questions. not really say but

237
00:21:39,912 --> 00:21:45,172
you need to write a couple sentences in response to the question. when we do that.

238
00:21:45,172 --> 00:21:51,392
the way we're gonna do it. is we're gonna like we do the mid term during the regular class here.

239
00:21:51,392 --> 00:21:56,417
but you can do it on here computers on your laptop. so

240
00:21:56,417 --> 00:22:01,997
you're actually gonna go out. you know through the campus and let's plan all this in excruciating

241
00:22:01,997 --> 00:22:07,137
detail. make sure everyone knows that's going on course in this case I'll be sitting here anyway. if

242
00:22:07,137 --> 00:22:12,217
you have a problem. bye. you're gonna go to the camp site today to take

243
00:22:12,217 --> 00:22:17,857
this midterm exam and that makes it

244
00:22:17,857 --> 00:22:22,857
much more efficient. well it's wrong time. the reason for one thing and

245
00:22:22,857 --> 00:22:28,337
make it much more efficient. because obviously

246
00:22:28,337 --> 00:22:33,437
I the person you created the exam part of what I do is I provide. what

247
00:22:33,437 --> 00:22:39,177
are the preferred answers to all the questions. so all the clothes and the questions like multiple choice.

248
00:22:39,177 --> 00:22:44,817
they can grade it instantaneously. is that. essentially what you submitted

249
00:22:44,817 --> 00:22:49,837
and we had a very very nice about that. it's a_lot easier. alright

250
00:22:49,837 --> 00:22:54,931
with a_lot less work for me or anyone else for that matter to figure out if

251
00:22:54,931 --> 00:23:00,051
we gave you a bad question. question that just didn't work for some reason and it went what

252
00:23:00,051 --> 00:23:05,391
I saying there is that if it turns out that people

253
00:23:05,391 --> 00:23:10,490
were systematically. many many people are taking one of the wrong choices and then

254
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:15,671
we look at everything about. why did they do that. and you might even be.

255
00:23:15,671 --> 00:23:20,671
I was in there because actually that was given as an alternative answer but something

256
00:23:20,671 --> 00:23:25,931
actually matters. the presentations are good because it was very

257
00:23:25,931 --> 00:23:31,010
the way that was too confusing and people can actually understand my call. because it wasn't

258
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:36,230
working well. you couldn't actually understand what I was asking for. so when he and another

259
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:41,531
thing is it. you can look instantaneously that distribution. what answers people games

260
00:23:41,531 --> 00:23:46,831
and that helps you sort. just quick question I have a problem. so that's

261
00:23:46,831 --> 00:23:51,931
it for couple reasons we do it. yeah. yeah my experience as

262
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:57,430
you know I'm I'm always nervous that everyone shopping here but such is life.

263
00:23:57,430 --> 00:24:02,450
twenty first that's right. so you don't use. this is in everybody for here at

264
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:07,950
the laptop open. so I'm thinking this is not gonna be a problem for anyone. bye.

265
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:13,030
yeah for some reason it is. yeah I'm sure you all know that. this is computer

266
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:18,970
lab in this complex. thanks message wanna another one go somewhere.

267
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:24,190
so if you can call me and say. I don't have anyway you have a laptop here. we'll switch down

268
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:31,130
at the same time in front of a computer one way or another. but I'm hoping everyone can take it in here. alright.

269
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:36,790
let's see and then case presentations

270
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:42,590
in the day. so if you're gonna make payment this is. this is part of

271
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:47,610
a big project where. I'm hoping you're gonna integrate a_lot_of things that you

272
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:53,497
were dealing with in the class or maybe some new things that you've learned into addressing it

273
00:24:53,497 --> 00:24:58,557
an issue. what how this will be very nice which is explained in

274
00:24:58,557 --> 00:25:04,536
lab detail and it's a little bit. is that you're gonna be giving real

275
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:09,677
cases. we are a condition off and

276
00:25:09,677 --> 00:25:14,776
he saw somebody who might have an application I really

277
00:25:14,776 --> 00:25:20,737
need to see. Oregon family related disease. and

278
00:25:20,737 --> 00:25:25,797
we had to conduct some decisions or conclusions. so basically what we're

279
00:25:25,797 --> 00:25:31,156
gonna do is we'll give you the whole story. see with our personal

280
00:25:31,156 --> 00:25:36,757
identifier is removed and we we wanna show you what what conclusions were reached by the commission.

281
00:25:36,757 --> 00:25:41,937
bye. we're gonna divide what we're gonna do for each one of those. we'll have

282
00:25:41,937 --> 00:25:47,017
two student team. one student team is gonna be assigned to

283
00:25:47,017 --> 00:25:52,077
our do pro meeting today. yeah Marjorie that it is in fact a

284
00:25:52,077 --> 00:25:57,080
call. bye this is occupational environmental exposures with the main disease

285
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:03,300
process and the other team is gonna be

286
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:10,320
assigned to you. bye. no it's not something else call

287
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:15,380
and so therefore bring in all the things I thought about two minutes ago. we're your team will

288
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:21,460
work like carefully reviewing the literature and organizing a detailed power point presentation

289
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:28,140
that you made to the whole class laying out

290
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:33,980
case the history of what happened and the argument that you're making. either sign to be pro

291
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:39,656
anti- and then the most volunteers one oh eight later.

292
00:26:39,656 --> 00:26:45,297
yeah. so we release every hiring needs everyone's power point at that point that you can actually

293
00:26:45,297 --> 00:26:51,317
see what you're up to. you just look at them that you can see what you're up on it. you at with Thursday

294
00:26:51,317 --> 00:26:56,536
and you can go look at their literature. because you know your card obviously to put your your

295
00:26:56,536 --> 00:27:01,617
citation. this is based on and then you just do a shorter

296
00:27:01,617 --> 00:27:06,717
bottle for next week and then after you do the remodel. finally

297
00:27:06,717 --> 00:27:12,117
we switched the order like the first second. actually did her a bottle for Jerry.

298
00:27:12,117 --> 00:27:17,837
is everyone in the class he was a member those two teams for that particular case

299
00:27:17,837 --> 00:27:22,977
and you get to vote on whether you think it was it wasn't caused by these

300
00:27:22,977 --> 00:27:28,057
exposures. I usually do this

301
00:27:28,057 --> 00:27:33,097
report to me. alright. it's eight one eight. they really enjoyed this part

302
00:27:33,097 --> 00:27:38,256
class and I saw where they can learn the most because it sort of get your head around how to actually

303
00:27:38,256 --> 00:27:43,416
take all these principals and ideas and even you know plain old facts and upside

304
00:27:43,416 --> 00:27:48,636
down to real life situation we have_to come to decision and have it have anything scientifically

305
00:27:48,636 --> 00:27:53,776
about a problem like this to reach a conclusion. so you be doing that in teams. I have

306
00:27:53,776 --> 00:27:58,776
I tried to balance the teams in terms of what information about people's

307
00:27:58,776 --> 00:28:04,116
background and so on so that it's reasonably fair and so on.

308
00:28:04,116 --> 00:28:09,336
because we we have a_lot_of people here. I think there's a couple more people wanna find out that it

309
00:28:09,336 --> 00:28:16,116
have been able to do it yet. but there's forty six people that were signed in the car.

310
00:28:16,116 --> 00:28:21,356
we manner. it seems a little bit bigger than I'd hoped but not too much bigger.

311
00:28:21,356 --> 00:28:28,096
just so we can get through them all in a reasonable number of sessions yet.

312
00:28:28,096 --> 00:28:33,216
anyone on team thing okay. you have time to prioritize what

313
00:28:33,216 --> 00:28:38,256
we did last year I think there a grand total of four cases. they're eighteen one four

314
00:28:38,256 --> 00:28:43,256
one nine Tech. I'm not sure he might. I wondered how the scheduling

315
00:28:43,256 --> 00:28:48,376
works we might have got five cases to not have the individual groups to

316
00:28:48,376 --> 00:28:53,556
large. alright. and then the final

317
00:28:53,556 --> 00:28:59,976
exam will be non- human. so

318
00:28:59,976 --> 00:29:06,556
don't forget everything you gonna be for the mid term exam that you would actually be directly in about.

319
00:29:06,556 --> 00:29:11,956
alright. any any and by the way. if you if you look back please.

320
00:29:11,956 --> 00:29:18,876
please do that. this does actually add up to a hundred percent. you got five six eight thirty

321
00:29:18,876 --> 00:29:24,416
twenty four twenty five twenty five. so that's a total great. any questions about

322
00:29:24,416 --> 00:29:31,076
sort of how how the grade is done for the course and maybe any other questions

323
00:29:31,076 --> 00:29:47,828
for right now. yes

324
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:54,127
yes so this is an reference to this class. bye. bye. yes

325
00:29:54,127 --> 00:29:59,507
I plan the plan is. hopefully

326
00:29:59,507 --> 00:30:04,587
at least a full week ahead of time from now on. but it doesn't like Tuesday. but it's close and

327
00:30:04,587 --> 00:30:10,427
I get this a week from now on. you'll be told here.

328
00:30:10,427 --> 00:30:17,487
they won't always do your discussion thread but there will be probably more open than the discussion thread.

329
00:30:17,487 --> 00:30:22,867
here's what we'd like to think about and see what your thoughts are. and again

330
00:30:22,867 --> 00:30:27,867
you only really actually great participation. so collect is right or wrong answers

331
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:32,948
like did you respond and put something in there. try to address what was being

332
00:30:32,948 --> 00:30:37,987
asked. one of the reasons of doing that. one of the reasons

333
00:30:37,987 --> 00:30:43,328
I wanna do that is someother

334
00:30:43,328 --> 00:30:48,588
samples. can be pretty. we would like to discuss in class in detail could be pretty

335
00:30:48,588 --> 00:30:53,928
complex and take a little out_of the door of all the information so that I did hear.

336
00:30:53,928 --> 00:30:59,148
everyone will have already read it and thought about it and even had to write out.

337
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:04,248
we put them in early. what they thought about things before we start to take it out.

338
00:31:04,248 --> 00:31:09,248
as group here in the class. so I I'm hoping that won't be barking.

339
00:31:09,248 --> 00:31:15,148
I'm hoping that will be actually quite interesting because it will

340
00:31:15,148 --> 00:31:20,348
tend to guarantee that it won't cooperate six fifty but really. alright

341
00:31:20,348 --> 00:31:26,868
well I don't know exactly what was going on and what they had to answer and then

342
00:31:26,868 --> 00:31:32,008
you know pitching groups or maybe spare you pass on what for you to sort of

343
00:31:32,008 --> 00:31:37,088
a fine what you think about that and I will help in some way we'll do it different ways and

344
00:31:37,088 --> 00:31:42,462
for my report back to the larger group anybody debate. I mean

345
00:31:42,462 --> 00:31:47,902
I probably think I think we have an opinion but sometimes I really don't. I mean sometimes

346
00:31:47,902 --> 00:31:52,922
it's not valid. it's complicated you can start either way about what you really

347
00:31:52,922 --> 00:31:58,422
happened. what what what is the best way to interpret. but yeah.

348
00:31:58,422 --> 00:32:04,902
so I know that answer your question yet. we'll get together at a time in the future.

349
00:32:04,902 --> 00:32:11,522
okay. anything else. alright.

350
00:32:11,522 --> 00:32:16,742
so I'm not gonna go over this in detail. but this is. bye five

351
00:32:16,742 --> 00:32:22,322
days. why the reasons are not going over the detail. you know it's over here at

352
00:32:22,322 --> 00:32:27,502
like three presenter and has Burton his name actually

353
00:32:27,502 --> 00:32:33,302
down here in several in a row. it's Tony Burton the other person I was talking about.

354
00:32:33,302 --> 00:32:38,302
I actually yeah to figure out what he can do it but he can't do so. we'll probably need to re

355
00:32:38,302 --> 00:32:43,794
organize the schedule of well we probably won't change though is when all the assignments

356
00:32:43,794 --> 00:32:49,394
happen for example. you know week from today. will release

357
00:32:49,394 --> 00:32:54,834
homework once a year to look at and I will expect

358
00:32:54,834 --> 00:32:59,974
a response from you by February second. as an example. so that I saw those things does have

359
00:32:59,974 --> 00:33:05,034
a little bowl of the assignment. pretty sure they were they

360
00:33:05,034 --> 00:33:10,594
say they are. but we may have_to move around. what just talk about which time

361
00:33:10,594 --> 00:33:16,848
after I get things straightened out. this message is time

362
00:33:16,848 --> 00:33:22,328
alright. so that's first to the end of the first

363
00:33:22,328 --> 00:33:27,668
one I'm not gonna try to go through these and then the

364
00:33:27,668 --> 00:33:32,728
second one. so I'm the final exam because we're on our and

365
00:33:32,728 --> 00:33:38,528
have two choices and I'm sure

366
00:33:38,528 --> 00:33:43,528
for someone one short there's always gonna be some people that would prefer a choice. a to B and B

367
00:33:43,528 --> 00:33:49,228
eight. alright I will I put in one of these because

368
00:33:49,228 --> 00:33:54,508
birthday. final exams is April

369
00:33:54,508 --> 00:34:00,828
twentieth. what's up here. the last day of final exams. is April twenty seventh.

370
00:34:00,828 --> 00:34:06,048
our choice based on one. this class happens between April twentieth and April twenty

371
00:34:06,048 --> 00:34:12,368
seventh. for when you take the final. and I love it doesn't fall behind it.

372
00:34:12,368 --> 00:34:17,483
probably the distinct majority people would prefer to get it over with. especially it is.

373
00:34:17,483 --> 00:34:22,523
I'll be glad to sit around for three days waiting to site one more time.

374
00:34:22,523 --> 00:34:28,143
with God darn thing. it could've been done earlier. so that's that's my

375
00:34:28,143 --> 00:34:33,483
that time. it be in his room and it would be on the laptop again. the mid term.

376
00:34:33,483 --> 00:34:38,483
but that's why. thanks for the time is up there. that is eight one five. when that

377
00:34:38,483 --> 00:34:43,583
anyone knew they were gonna do their hair that day that kinda thing.

378
00:34:43,583 --> 00:34:48,683
okay. you can you can read it and we're detail. so

379
00:34:48,683 --> 00:34:54,723
this is what the first post was read out loud.

380
00:34:54,723 --> 00:35:00,983
say. I mean what I say here. I would really

381
00:35:00,983 --> 00:35:06,283
I'm not. I'm too old to have a good memory. but I'm gonna try.

382
00:35:06,283 --> 00:35:11,883
remember I did try. I'm gonna try and learn of my people's names as I can manage and I got

383
00:35:11,883 --> 00:35:17,723
I got have all the photographs and one or two people. Cathy didn't want them in there or something.

384
00:35:17,723 --> 00:35:22,869
and I and especially if I know little bit more about your background and what

385
00:35:22,869 --> 00:35:27,969
you're interested in in regards to help me to put the two together. so heads

386
00:35:27,969 --> 00:35:33,869
up there. I would really like you to share information about your background

387
00:35:33,869 --> 00:35:39,089
with me which means with everyone. what you put in your wrong information. you can see whatever

388
00:35:39,089 --> 00:35:45,809
else is put in before you or after you by the people and especially

389
00:35:45,809 --> 00:35:50,929
yeah I guess you can tell me if I'm doing it right now but I don't really like

390
00:35:50,929 --> 00:35:56,349
standing in the front of a classroom certificate. I'm not the source of all knowledge by any means.

391
00:35:56,349 --> 00:36:02,909
not sure collectively e-mail about a subject on some of the expert party and probably collectively

392
00:36:02,909 --> 00:36:07,949
from almost all subject you know way more than I do because lot of news room with a_lot_of experience

393
00:36:07,949 --> 00:36:12,969
in various times. so it's really helpful to have some

394
00:36:12,969 --> 00:36:18,509
idea. Mary I've actually done some significant work and thought about

395
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:23,563
what whatever it maybe just wanna identify yourself as someone has some

396
00:36:23,563 --> 00:36:29,183
familiarity with a particular interest in the state budget like we to cover. so

397
00:36:29,183 --> 00:36:35,843
that's very helpful to me and help clarify.

398
00:36:35,843 --> 00:36:44,263
that's just your name. nothing to do. alright.

399
00:36:44,263 --> 00:36:50,263
alright. you went shopping. you can guarantee that.

400
00:36:50,263 --> 00:36:57,183
give me nothing about Amazon on the whole screen. okay.

401
00:36:57,183 --> 00:37:02,243
alright. Andy usually don't do that but for this person

402
00:37:02,243 --> 00:37:07,463
I'm doing it where you have_to respond before you see what everybody else is probably

403
00:37:07,463 --> 00:37:13,563
the only time I'll do that but it.

404
00:37:13,563 --> 00:37:19,203
okay. so this is going to

405
00:37:19,203 --> 00:37:24,253
course content these are sort of all the different areas that

406
00:37:24,253 --> 00:37:29,353
we are planning to talk about it look at it and found out which related to education vinyl

407
00:37:29,353 --> 00:37:34,473
diseases. and I just didn't say that before so I should probably

408
00:37:34,473 --> 00:37:39,513
still there. yeah. hi this is Corey Tasha I used to

409
00:37:39,513 --> 00:37:46,453
teach cars and occupational and environmental at the genealogy. specifically

410
00:37:46,453 --> 00:37:53,153
there we're still being time. I'm in Vermont with the allergy.

411
00:37:53,153 --> 00:37:58,333
bye. professors. well actually Maria Neil

412
00:37:58,333 --> 00:38:03,373
has joined appointment in DHS Internet. this is but there's a

413
00:38:03,373 --> 00:38:08,653
not sort of straight up occupational genealogy course it's been cut.

414
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:14,913
so just card. trying to capture.

415
00:38:14,913 --> 00:38:20,333
talk about some issues and at the genealogy. they tend to be distinct

416
00:38:20,333 --> 00:38:25,863
for occupational study where are you thinking. you must

417
00:38:25,863 --> 00:38:31,443
have run into be out in the same level. definitely same sort of approach in your other

418
00:38:31,443 --> 00:38:36,823
courses. correct me if I turned out to be wrong but. so there is

419
00:38:36,823 --> 00:38:41,843
time but it it had about twenty percent of the class. it is about that eighty percent more

420
00:38:41,843 --> 00:38:48,623
straight up. talk about diseases and related to exposure.

421
00:38:48,623 --> 00:38:53,943
alright. so let's do a couple of examples.

422
00:38:53,943 --> 00:39:00,003
in case you're not already excited about. just kinda stuff. maybe get you interested in it.

423
00:39:00,003 --> 00:39:05,023
so here's the data pad and almost everywhere box

424
00:39:05,023 --> 00:39:10,303
or water seeds in the building. these are supposed to talk questions by the way and

425
00:39:10,303 --> 00:39:16,123
I'll color. no way for you to detect it and

426
00:39:16,123 --> 00:39:21,363
it account for half of all. I think I should go more than half

427
00:39:21,363 --> 00:39:26,411
of all the exposure tired of your mediation is

428
00:39:26,411 --> 00:39:31,531
not due to medical procedure started a CT scan plain x-rays MRIs

429
00:39:31,531 --> 00:39:37,131
and give them some kind of material. and the second leading cause of lung cancer

430
00:39:37,131 --> 00:39:43,831
et_cetera and the leading because it's not a smoker. so

431
00:39:43,831 --> 00:39:49,231
everybody's up to know if this is a problem. so that's

432
00:39:49,231 --> 00:39:54,251
made on right.

433
00:39:54,251 --> 00:39:59,703
I saw you tonight Plainfield a chance

434
00:39:59,703 --> 00:40:04,763
to join us. great big capacity where it should be black it's looking because

435
00:40:04,763 --> 00:40:09,803
they should be just mostly air their lung cancer is showing up on chest

436
00:40:09,803 --> 00:40:15,123
x-ray. and here's an example of a probably at home.

437
00:40:15,123 --> 00:40:20,583
that's had some remediation done. had a ventilation system installed. to remove

438
00:40:20,583 --> 00:40:26,483
from the excess radon from the house. this is basement.

439
00:40:26,483 --> 00:40:31,743
alright. thanks. I haven't sold or bought a house

440
00:40:31,743 --> 00:40:36,863
a long time I believe in the state. somebody I'm sure someone who knows it. I don't think you actually can

441
00:40:36,863 --> 00:40:42,003
sell or buy a house without having radon level measured in the house. I think it's legally

442
00:40:42,003 --> 00:40:47,523
required to is it optional. it's not a card.

443
00:40:47,523 --> 00:40:53,923
I was also because of a hundred forty dollars. maybe this is because I expect the bar. you know to do that. okay.

444
00:40:53,923 --> 00:40:59,530
so try remember. so let's see just

445
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:05,410
to keep you interested let me my sis number.

446
00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:14,570
so if you go backwards I'll tell you. okay. so

447
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:19,730
questions about your question I got a question for you. why

448
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:30,050
re the house rate on getting all means basement. I know the answer that.

449
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:35,090
bye. it is actually better than geological material and you know where it's coming

450
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:40,650
from. why just showing up in geological Care. I'm at the gas. you know I must be steam generator.

451
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:45,970
just dissipate right. yeah pretty active decay.

452
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:51,090
so this Long Cascade Real development with the calendar another way I acted on

453
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:56,228
it and eventually you get to kinda

454
00:41:56,228 --> 00:42:01,628
radon it's problem. so there's two two reasons it's probably just

455
00:42:01,628 --> 00:42:07,568
one because the top of that uranium two thirty eight. which is a half flight

456
00:42:07,568 --> 00:42:12,828
four and a half billion years which is almost exactly the agent.

457
00:42:12,828 --> 00:42:18,028
so only half of the regular active uranium has changed. so there's still

458
00:42:18,028 --> 00:42:23,308
a_lot_of it around. so it's actually very important. parents

459
00:42:23,308 --> 00:42:28,428
original parent of the cascade. such a long half life. it would be here. alright.

460
00:42:28,428 --> 00:42:35,108
this is all disappeared long ago. if it is short. bye. and the other problem is

461
00:42:35,108 --> 00:42:40,208
great I think it's three two twenty two right. I'm thinking about something about getting

462
00:42:40,208 --> 00:42:46,308
rocks because there's two two eight K they might wanna count

463
00:42:46,308 --> 00:42:51,508
on for say the half five a little over three days. just perfect. yeah

464
00:42:51,508 --> 00:42:58,080
from where it is in the ground somewhere very different but there's differences in pressure hey

465
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:03,100
Sharon over pretty short time. most of it will go on

466
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:08,160
to the next product price which and I won't

467
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:13,360
get into it too much. I just I wanted to just say that you know this morning. maybe I'd

468
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:18,440
use me for about leasing somebody on this and probably knew all that already but I'm guessing most people have

469
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:25,280
had it presented that way. so if this is anything about why the call you.

470
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:30,640
alright. you big this contaminated. does

471
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:35,900
it. there's no reason the human body needs it. almost all of it end up

472
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:41,120
in bone eventually. and I can take years decades half

473
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:46,200
of it to be cleared and has many different organs

474
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:53,074
as soon as you can read them all there and children are particularly susceptible.

475
00:43:53,074 --> 00:43:58,694
well actually I'm sure if you had said you might be home with more than one answer. but they wanna tell me what

476
00:43:58,694 --> 00:44:03,854
the answer is here. later. right. okay.

477
00:44:03,854 --> 00:44:09,314
and you all all this already but that's why that's a big deal. alright. and

478
00:44:09,314 --> 00:44:14,814
yeah it's a little story. the first time I went to South Africa.

479
00:44:14,814 --> 00:44:19,834
Way to work on things was ninety ninety two

480
00:44:19,834 --> 00:44:25,034
and I got floor from someone who who

481
00:44:25,034 --> 00:44:31,074
was high up in one of the major are over five eight or something. I guess I'll have_to call you in case you lost.

482
00:44:31,074 --> 00:44:37,434
so this is ninety ninety two. they wanna know roughly what year.

483
00:44:37,434 --> 00:44:47,554
putting gas. and

484
00:44:47,554 --> 00:44:52,994
no no gas leaking any from this day forward. so here are fourteen

485
00:44:52,994 --> 00:44:58,464
years later hey and by the way. I'll probably like to get a single

486
00:44:58,464 --> 00:45:03,544
document of all Public Health. if you can point two five. what is the enormous

487
00:45:03,544 --> 00:45:09,864
impact and lowering peoples Plaza level. this country. bye. be removed from again.

488
00:45:09,864 --> 00:45:15,004
gonna be here. okay. so ninety ninety two they took me around and you show me

489
00:45:15,004 --> 00:45:20,064
all the different things and I just talked to the site they said this is we're gonna build our new federal

490
00:45:20,064 --> 00:45:25,304
apple plan. let's plan to address the late plans. we're gonna start

491
00:45:25,304 --> 00:45:30,644
making in saving hundred dollar gasoline.

492
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:36,404
and I can visit. I was trying to be small but I said you know Jesus afternoon.

493
00:45:36,404 --> 00:45:41,464
see I cannot your best move in the long run because I'm sure you're well aware.

494
00:45:41,464 --> 00:45:47,444
there's always time for you sir. hi. come trying to you.

495
00:45:47,444 --> 00:45:53,184
well yeah we're thinking about they actually never talked to me. but they never actually built the plan.

496
00:45:53,184 --> 00:45:58,216
but I was part of May. so that's what we're planning to do next that's

497
00:45:58,216 --> 00:46:03,516
a big deal. and I'm sure everyone knows that.

498
00:46:03,516 --> 00:46:08,716
yeah I got a picture right on the paint can and let

499
00:46:08,716 --> 00:46:13,976
it drain. still have a few applications out doors because it's a resistant to weather and

500
00:46:13,976 --> 00:46:19,456
this is as you know. it was being used indoors. you know older homes pretty

501
00:46:19,456 --> 00:46:24,776
large potential problem. if it works out. alright. okay.

502
00:46:24,776 --> 00:46:30,136
so in the eighties early nineties.

503
00:46:30,136 --> 00:46:35,442
people feel funky but I really worried about eggs and there's dog

504
00:46:35,442 --> 00:46:40,622
shipping having anyway for most many other reasons very tight. you have the tires and socks like that

505
00:46:40,622 --> 00:46:49,342
and more Home Care workers are using rubber gloves and

506
00:46:49,342 --> 00:46:55,582
resources in Elgin. and if you had direct contact.

507
00:46:55,582 --> 00:47:02,502
you could have a problem that you. also please go out there. so all of you there.

508
00:47:02,502 --> 00:47:08,982
directly with Health Care dollars already but I'm assuming many people in this room. haven't so

509
00:47:08,982 --> 00:47:14,262
you know you want them to be rolling to we easy to put on. so they would be part of an inside savings

510
00:47:14,262 --> 00:47:19,462
flight on hand more easily. unfortunately that pottery get mixed up with with late tax

511
00:47:19,462 --> 00:47:24,822
with the agent that's our genic. and thanks for being hale. so you can have

512
00:47:24,822 --> 00:47:30,462
doctors to contact him the time. but you can have a severe respiratory reaction.

513
00:47:30,462 --> 00:47:35,859
I can to you have time. okay. and

514
00:47:35,859 --> 00:47:40,899
so you got a situation that says they're hiring here whatever you wanna say that we

515
00:47:40,899 --> 00:47:46,279
if you got personal protective equipment. probably post event

516
00:47:46,279 --> 00:47:51,319
helpers. if you have an HIV positive. just calling in a different problem.

517
00:47:51,319 --> 00:47:56,539
so I wanna know if this is latex allergy and that picture on the side of course is

518
00:47:56,539 --> 00:48:02,079
eight pictures on Wednesday. so the classic latex

519
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:07,499
allergy contact dermatitis. they've been wearing gloves. that's when they break out.

520
00:48:07,499 --> 00:48:13,699
I was just I to see anyone for

521
00:48:13,699 --> 00:48:18,819
contact dermatitis. how long from one exposure to

522
00:48:18,819 --> 00:48:24,199
the current exposure is gonna cost a problem that like the initial exposure to allergens.

523
00:48:24,199 --> 00:48:29,459
how are on the current exposure. the problem occurs to you.

524
00:48:29,459 --> 00:48:36,825
I'm gonna see Adam out the reaction. anyway have any idea

525
00:48:36,825 --> 00:48:43,005
okay two weeks and a little too far out there. bye your way in the right direction.

526
00:48:43,005 --> 00:48:48,205
you don't buy. that's a different type of reaction instead. I just missed you know why I needed

527
00:48:48,205 --> 00:48:53,705
it. give me a call. everything's ready to go. so that you get that.

528
00:48:53,705 --> 00:48:58,945
when you know why we haven't and it's been fifteen minutes or less.

529
00:48:58,945 --> 00:49:04,245
actually you know talk a minute. contact. yeah usually forty eight to seventy two hours

530
00:49:04,245 --> 00:49:09,485
because it's so mediated reaction. text thing has_to be moved from somewhere else and arrive

531
00:49:09,485 --> 00:49:16,385
there at five thirty waiting to happen. okay.

532
00:49:16,385 --> 00:49:21,625
yeah just wan. maybe not everyone the classrooms didn't know about that and we're probably gonna

533
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:26,985
spend some time talking about this is Pat from Siemens

534
00:49:26,985 --> 00:49:32,105
for worms and was introduced you

535
00:49:32,105 --> 00:49:37,117
had ever called you back in the fifties and it wasn't actually tested in the formal

536
00:49:37,117 --> 00:49:43,657
lab. so the early sixties even that are looking into dude and

537
00:49:43,657 --> 00:49:48,917
in Rosen Shanks female Rosa try Cathy

538
00:49:48,917 --> 00:49:55,437
because decrease her absence from town and

539
00:49:55,437 --> 00:50:00,777
it was recommended to go forward with using it

540
00:50:00,777 --> 00:50:07,457
and there was this production facility and it says in which is down nineteen seventy seven.

541
00:50:07,457 --> 00:50:16,277
I mailed that work just want the. we're manufacturing

542
00:50:16,277 --> 00:50:21,317
and design. just talking to John start realizing been

543
00:50:21,317 --> 00:50:26,937
trying to father child. several numbers except the ball

544
00:50:26,937 --> 00:50:32,275
part and nothing was happening and

545
00:50:32,275 --> 00:50:38,835
yeah this Gary when about this especially if your mail it's Gary.

546
00:50:38,835 --> 00:50:44,015
no changes will be no change in the secondary sex characteristics. no

547
00:50:44,015 --> 00:50:50,455
warning any sort to tell you that there's something going wrong with your reproductive

548
00:50:50,455 --> 00:50:56,795
from this exposure. and Dan. despite the fact

549
00:50:56,795 --> 00:51:02,235
this is Sam. you said you had. it would be exported

550
00:51:02,235 --> 00:51:07,295
by you in company. places all over the world to be used for

551
00:51:07,295 --> 00:51:12,635
that work fantastic for you. bye. did great job of telling

552
00:51:12,635 --> 00:51:17,875
for my. so this is. the number is Susan

553
00:51:17,875 --> 00:51:23,115
from about representing tens of thousands of workers. our

554
00:51:23,115 --> 00:51:28,115
as well. it raises all kinds of interesting questions and issues questions about

555
00:51:28,115 --> 00:51:35,253
what's article. I wanna go there today I just wanna see if they might know what this is

556
00:51:35,253 --> 00:51:43,473
this is Carl propane right

557
00:51:43,473 --> 00:51:49,213
and it's amazing people anything so there's a billboard.

558
00:51:49,213 --> 00:51:54,673
let me nine eight seven eight. California which by the way it was where the facility

559
00:51:54,673 --> 00:51:59,693
where they figure out this is going I was actually in Southern California. outside of the same repeat

560
00:51:59,693 --> 00:52:04,713
me and tell. got the biggest problem ever. the name of John

561
00:52:04,713 --> 00:52:09,913
Shell. the other group that was making lovely ground out

562
00:52:09,913 --> 00:52:15,013
chemical Company at the time and there you

563
00:52:15,013 --> 00:52:20,033
go. alright. so I

564
00:52:20,033 --> 00:52:25,153
purposely used up most of my time doing that. any other questions about how

565
00:52:25,153 --> 00:52:34,843
the organization of the course. okay. and

566
00:52:34,843 --> 00:52:39,923
saw that the next. okay. this is about true

567
00:52:39,923 --> 00:52:45,023
confession. I've been sorry. I think very recently and it's embarrassing. I've

568
00:52:45,023 --> 00:52:50,483
been doing that. seven five two. not ten dollars and seventy

569
00:52:50,483 --> 00:52:55,643
two. what what makes for a good presentation it's really

570
00:52:55,643 --> 00:53:00,663
engaging people interested and how to use power point

571
00:53:00,663 --> 00:53:08,003
five and so on. so you can do you can get through. so

572
00:53:08,003 --> 00:53:13,143
you probably violated

573
00:53:13,143 --> 00:53:18,403
by this slide show however good news that you won't be answer any questions

574
00:53:18,403 --> 00:53:23,863
or exams from this particular presentation. that's all. feel free to say you can look at that yourself

575
00:53:23,863 --> 00:53:38,023
and skip through something. but what you gonna see is a lots of

576
00:53:38,023 --> 00:53:43,023
lots better to have young words. not nearly having a fun pictures. if

577
00:53:43,023 --> 00:53:48,203
you did. we're

578
00:53:48,203 --> 00:53:56,043
gonna give you the history. you don't worry about that right now. so

579
00:53:56,043 --> 00:54:02,783
this is giving you. you can only read it to you but this is giving you basically

580
00:54:02,783 --> 00:54:08,263
what our divisional on Madison. it's about what are the different stuff.

581
00:54:08,263 --> 00:54:13,458
they're involved with. if you recognize

582
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:19,918
potential hazards you need to be able to make a diagnosis and you may be able to treat

583
00:54:19,918 --> 00:54:25,218
people that have this problem in the court. most importantly you're most interested in this prevention

584
00:54:25,218 --> 00:54:30,358
and what. I know many of you and that you are starting. it's much more obviously

585
00:54:30,358 --> 00:54:35,858
much more directly involved with what you really wanna do which is primary prevention and what

586
00:54:35,858 --> 00:54:41,238
we doctor types do. we're treating people like there. you have a problem.

587
00:54:41,238 --> 00:54:46,258
yeah I'm special hygienist Janice industrial hygienist and the people that really focused on how

588
00:54:46,258 --> 00:54:56,018
we prevent these diseases from occurring in the work place and trying to begin with right.

589
00:54:56,018 --> 00:55:01,478
why don't we you know in general. that I have

590
00:55:01,478 --> 00:55:06,638
actually customized facial study with the run Jimmy. one of reasons

591
00:55:06,638 --> 00:55:12,038
not one or two reasons they think that that is true. why I got you in our world that

592
00:55:12,038 --> 00:55:17,628
our best information about human effects of some exposures.

593
00:55:17,628 --> 00:55:31,508
come from occupational studies.

594
00:55:31,508 --> 00:55:37,668
yeah I would agree with that. if you have if you have reason to believe

595
00:55:37,668 --> 00:55:42,748
that agent is horrible. I might be harmful. I do not consider that because

596
00:55:42,748 --> 00:55:48,348
I was just testing on something but anyway if you happens I mean. I should be careful.

597
00:55:48,348 --> 00:55:53,668
that is done without focus and when you only expect

598
00:55:53,668 --> 00:55:59,028
very mild problem the reactions that are permanent. it's not like an afternoon. can you do that.

599
00:55:59,028 --> 00:56:04,408
bye. ninety nine percent of time would you say that's correct. okay. alright.

600
00:56:04,408 --> 00:56:09,548
so that does one reason. any other reasons. I

601
00:56:09,548 --> 00:56:15,016
know part of why

602
00:56:15,016 --> 00:56:20,036
clinical trial. it's not it's gonna do is. wireless does not a

603
00:56:20,036 --> 00:56:29,856
patient.

604
00:56:29,856 --> 00:56:36,316
that's definitely true. that's very important and

605
00:56:36,316 --> 00:56:41,416
the only thing I'm not sure about it. does that really explain why their educational thing you have environmental

606
00:56:41,416 --> 00:56:47,776
exposure to take use but has a different.

607
00:56:47,776 --> 00:56:56,536
bye me back.

608
00:56:56,536 --> 00:57:01,776
that's an excellent point. actually your partners too. bye.

609
00:57:01,776 --> 00:57:06,916
that's it complaint because I would say

610
00:57:06,916 --> 00:57:12,056
at least ninety five percent of all. looking at some of our knowledge including

611
00:57:12,056 --> 00:57:17,266
work patients because of disease and the study when they fall down.

612
00:57:17,266 --> 00:57:22,286
they fall down on the exposure estimation. that's usually by far the most

613
00:57:22,286 --> 00:57:27,366
difficult thing to do. it's got a bad time. so nine three eight.

614
00:57:27,366 --> 00:57:37,386
partly because that's we have decent information to come to conclusion yet.

615
00:57:37,386 --> 00:57:43,046
right. that's the one I was most looking for exposure.

616
00:57:43,046 --> 00:57:48,546
it's very from ages ages but they're often astronomical hiring workers not only

617
00:57:48,546 --> 00:57:53,866
are the actual exposure is higher. but in many cases.

618
00:57:53,866 --> 00:57:58,866
the regulation. allow exposures the workers to be many orders

619
00:57:58,866 --> 00:58:04,946
of magnitude. higher then to the general public like you taking in a meeting air pollution rights.

620
00:58:04,946 --> 00:58:11,406
so all those things that are going to bed. I would say go together. that

621
00:58:11,406 --> 00:58:16,480
you have to remove it. if anyone if anyone is gonna have a problem from exposure. it's

622
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:21,580
gonna be some proof of work for us because are almost certain to have by far the highest exposures of

623
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:27,100
any humans workers that work directly with the station and you can. in

624
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:32,300
in a few situations you can do a really good study because you have some reasonable documentation

625
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:39,280
of exposure. so you have_to look at what it is it's exposure response those response

626
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:44,820
and you can't do it the other way because it's call. if you do get agents.

627
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:49,940
please call me. my cousin Edwards a text to do something like analyze control clinical trial.

628
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:55,140
okay. great. so.

629
00:58:55,140 --> 00:59:00,160
so let's do a little bit history.

630
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:05,220
so if it's just the definition of environmental health. so when you talk about.

631
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:11,356
nine our professional studies. usually they're focused on exposure

632
00:59:11,356 --> 00:59:16,496
air or water or sometime. so I don't although usually different deposition

633
00:59:16,496 --> 00:59:22,476
from the air and that kinda thing. where

634
00:59:22,476 --> 00:59:27,576
in most. not always but most occupational setting. if you have

635
00:59:27,576 --> 00:59:32,616
racial exposure. that's the big issue. not all. but there can be

636
00:59:32,616 --> 00:59:37,616
issues with congestion that can done the dishes and direct skin contact. most occupational

637
00:59:37,616 --> 00:59:45,016
studies it's gonna be innovation on that you worried about. alright.

638
00:59:45,016 --> 00:59:51,950
sometimes I wish we were ready for directions anytime talking

639
00:59:51,950 --> 00:59:57,030
alright this is point out that it's the fact which you have been exposure.

640
00:59:57,030 --> 01:00:02,270
you have paid attention to what the exposure is our account and activate time and see what the relationship

641
01:00:02,270 --> 01:00:08,430
is differentiate area of Madison from all the other ones

642
01:00:08,430 --> 01:00:13,490
and environmental exposure. like we had talked about often on high enough for easy

643
01:00:13,490 --> 01:00:18,590
enough to answer me. so that we

644
01:00:18,590 --> 01:00:23,810
often in the next patient. so see just calling from Doctor Madison

645
01:00:23,810 --> 01:00:29,490
before your sir better recognize it's not only people in the industry that sometimes has significant problems.

646
01:00:29,490 --> 01:00:34,530
good example of the custodians and all kinds of buildings probably including all that

647
01:00:34,530 --> 01:00:39,570
maybe exposed all kinds of cleaning agents and ways that you might be in excess

648
01:00:39,570 --> 01:00:44,730
exposure should be. so in and so we're

649
01:00:44,730 --> 01:00:49,930
talking about things like cute injury which maybe you won't get too much running on about

650
01:00:49,930 --> 01:00:55,281
you know yeah my phone got broken wires didn't work on that last right at work.

651
01:00:55,281 --> 01:01:00,381
Bob Ross is talking about things like cancer which

652
01:01:00,381 --> 01:01:06,161
has someone already. you need to. if you example. usually

653
01:01:06,161 --> 01:01:11,161
these for solid tumors. not as much because like the convenience of it for solid tumors

654
01:01:11,161 --> 01:01:16,661
which remote types of cancer. Steve Lane. the right time from the inception

655
01:01:16,661 --> 01:01:21,941
of an exposure and the person's first expose is capable of increasing the risk of developing

656
01:01:21,941 --> 01:01:27,281
this particular cancers. to when you can actually diagnose with cancer

657
01:01:27,281 --> 01:01:32,881
has come in for your parents to February. in order to check.

658
01:01:32,881 --> 01:01:38,901
sometimes you you know like for your asbestos.

659
01:01:38,901 --> 01:01:44,001
call me. Missus Philly Elma. Evans easy estimate. so that it's nothing.

660
01:01:44,001 --> 01:01:49,241
it's not about the phone seems to call back you get a chance for the lining

661
01:01:49,241 --> 01:01:54,667
of the lungs were actually delighted to have them and as well so

662
01:01:54,667 --> 01:01:59,807
you neck hey. I mean it's forty to forty five years.

663
01:01:59,807 --> 01:02:04,987
after spoke smoking again before the individual actually shows up with diagnosis of will need to pay on.

664
01:02:04,987 --> 01:02:10,147
which is normally sale within five years and almost every one

665
01:02:10,147 --> 01:02:15,227
day. so if there's maybe another spot that

666
01:02:15,227 --> 01:02:21,207
it's more fun just talking. I've only had another question.

667
01:02:21,207 --> 01:02:26,887
why is that. if I saw

668
01:02:26,887 --> 01:02:32,227
Don is doing it. did you know. bye. if I use the term

669
01:02:32,227 --> 01:02:37,347
prospect back to somebody as compared to retrospective study. most of this week but you never know what that means

670
01:02:37,347 --> 01:02:42,867
very. it's a prospect event. for those you that doll. if you can do a study

671
01:02:42,867 --> 01:02:48,827
and say you is the investigator. you've actually followed the person for the time real time.

672
01:02:48,827 --> 01:02:54,047
to see what happens. Chris Rector is back up is very very occurred and you're somehow looking at records

673
01:02:54,047 --> 01:02:59,507
or something. if you haven't heard so what would you say.

674
01:02:59,507 --> 01:03:05,107
I advocated. I said you know the first perspective that is much better. you

675
01:03:05,107 --> 01:03:10,287
you have investigator you can be sure with the measurements of exposure are you really are possible. you

676
01:03:10,287 --> 01:03:15,447
can be sure about the disease. I'm very not like that but then he wants to do a retrospective

677
01:03:15,447 --> 01:03:20,807
study. we've got always records there are seven body and especially for exposure

678
01:03:20,807 --> 01:03:26,127
measures. you need to really understand the exposure message is know why somebody was out there taking the exposure

679
01:03:26,127 --> 01:03:31,347
and that's often not included in the records and so on. so I really

680
01:03:31,347 --> 01:03:37,047
wanna get an answer it personally. this agent. hey. you the work place. can call

681
01:03:37,047 --> 01:03:42,627
from Cancer. calling can. we'll go with right now.

682
01:03:42,627 --> 01:03:47,667
and so I don't expect you. what would you say to me. if it was a

683
01:03:47,667 --> 01:03:54,167
great idea. have a nice day. it's good.

684
01:03:54,167 --> 01:03:59,621
what's the problem with that perspective study that issue

685
01:03:59,621 --> 01:04:05,521
I gave you a very patient. a few seconds ago.

686
01:04:05,521 --> 01:04:11,561
yeah it's like. okay. so you wanna do it respectively probably before the time. you gonna spend

687
01:04:11,561 --> 01:04:16,721
thirty years waiting for you in the mall

688
01:04:16,721 --> 01:04:21,901
and I don't if you moved your study but probably today I have_to be in history is the tenth of thousands of other

689
01:04:21,901 --> 01:04:26,961
people instead and not necessarily exposed. when you finally figure out. hey really does cost

690
01:04:26,961 --> 01:04:32,421
Colin cancer. so call me back I think that's really great at the Greek festival approaches

691
01:04:32,421 --> 01:04:38,241
and that's why you see if this is long late.

692
01:04:38,241 --> 01:04:43,861
had to tend to be. yesterday I went to do a retrospective study. you not really gonna be able to do study.

693
01:04:43,861 --> 01:04:49,021
that's it. thanks. bye. although that's a long discussion about what to do next. you don't have the right

694
01:04:49,021 --> 01:04:55,301
perspective date. okay. and

695
01:04:55,301 --> 01:05:00,803
by the way. you hear me say this many times probably hey if I have

696
01:05:00,803 --> 01:05:05,923
house and we're ninety eight percent politics on last week. so we'll have_to all get

697
01:05:05,923 --> 01:05:11,343
used to that but you're welcome to do the same. whatever they are. I looked to me.

698
01:05:11,343 --> 01:05:16,423
bye. hey can I know you're a bad turn. talk about things like

699
01:05:16,423 --> 01:05:21,663
people have_to say do had motions maybe thousands of times a day or something.

700
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:26,803
when you get a problem like carpal tunnels and John over ten tonight as it becomes

701
01:05:26,803 --> 01:05:32,243
part of your doesn't go away. that's it they have_to do it work all day long. alright that's.

702
01:05:32,243 --> 01:05:37,303
it's part of that that's like a classic example of what we mean when we say or we not. there's got a

703
01:05:37,303 --> 01:05:44,883
thing that you enjoy. have the strength. alright. so I

704
01:05:44,883 --> 01:05:50,143
have need you know Morgan engineering college engineering.

705
01:05:50,143 --> 01:05:56,823
the telephone was involved. you know University Michigan.

706
01:05:56,823 --> 01:06:01,973
this is E institution in United_States star dinner tonight. if you go back and look at

707
01:06:01,973 --> 01:06:07,453
what was going on with sixty seventy even the nineteen eighties maybe even now.

708
01:06:07,453 --> 01:06:12,673
so that's true. and there was

709
01:06:12,673 --> 01:06:18,113
a big push by OSHA time when it was.

710
01:06:18,113 --> 01:06:23,353
I know it was a democratic president of the time to say we need a national

711
01:06:23,353 --> 01:06:28,753
Ergonomic standard. they wanna know whether you're existing that national economic

712
01:06:28,753 --> 01:06:34,123
standard now you don't share in our standards.

713
01:06:34,123 --> 01:06:39,803
the US time. specifically passed legislation

714
01:06:39,803 --> 01:06:44,843
saying that you will not have an informed ocean. if you have a message. you

715
01:06:44,843 --> 01:06:52,223
will not have a nice day. direct direct involvement

716
01:06:52,223 --> 01:06:57,223
issue for you. was to touch this is you motion.

717
01:06:57,223 --> 01:07:02,403
hey you know there's like space at a very strong standards like state of Washington State

718
01:07:02,403 --> 01:07:07,843
of California and some other ones. michigan's probably that part is good. but

719
01:07:07,843 --> 01:07:12,883
there's no national standard discount. so I guess

720
01:07:12,883 --> 01:07:18,443
what I'm trying to bring out for environmental

721
01:07:18,443 --> 01:07:24,523
and occupational but there's been a huge amount

722
01:07:24,523 --> 01:07:30,083
of huge economic issues. usually involved doing something about this exposures. alright.

723
01:07:30,083 --> 01:07:35,124
bye. and so there's there's many

724
01:07:35,124 --> 01:07:40,444
interested parties and some interested parties. tend to have a very strong influence

725
01:07:40,444 --> 01:07:45,704
often. over. what happens with allegations of legislation.

726
01:07:45,704 --> 01:07:51,164
so if you don't if you don't like

727
01:07:51,164 --> 01:07:56,244
political controversy or having the balance. what's best for human health

728
01:07:56,244 --> 01:08:01,564
with well. but what again. I cannot possible losses ago.

729
01:08:01,564 --> 01:08:06,984
how do we think about that. if you don't wanna do that kinda thing. if you're in PHS you picked the wrong

730
01:08:06,984 --> 01:08:12,084
program. that's it. you're always. it's not

731
01:08:12,084 --> 01:08:20,944
a part of what happens part of the train. okay.

732
01:08:20,944 --> 01:08:26,024
so this is environmental diseases. for example that

733
01:08:26,024 --> 01:08:33,210
they're waiting to we talked about some of already today and a talking to global issues

734
01:08:33,210 --> 01:08:38,490
Chad Chad. hey actually this is one we're doing pretty well. actually regarding regarding your account.

735
01:08:38,490 --> 01:08:43,811
the last forty eight hours. I think probably everyone this room. know something

736
01:08:43,811 --> 01:08:49,311
about this issue about stratosphere was on those on very high up and that was very very

737
01:08:49,311 --> 01:08:54,570
positive and important because it keeps you out_of our

738
01:08:54,570 --> 01:09:00,090
lives in penetrating the service there. bye. and that part was not too sunburn

739
01:09:00,090 --> 01:09:05,110
but can you know talk about I did get it breaking to you

740
01:09:05,110 --> 01:09:10,510
today because mediation and I figured out in

741
01:09:10,510 --> 01:09:15,670
Florida Florida apartment never been using most of refrigerators and most air

742
01:09:15,670 --> 01:09:21,391
conditioners like in United_States and always I was gonna come to

743
01:09:21,391 --> 01:09:26,510
work. that they would have for

744
01:09:26,510 --> 01:09:31,670
breaking down. on three. you know you know it was a product that was just playing.

745
01:09:31,670 --> 01:09:39,196
just the usual to and the bad thing about it. can

746
01:09:39,196 --> 01:09:45,916
count on. don't come back and he was very knowledgeable

747
01:09:45,916 --> 01:09:51,676
patient to start breaking out. three. lot of his own

748
01:09:51,676 --> 01:09:57,256
and because of various reasons. this

749
01:09:57,256 --> 01:10:02,696
problem was most noticeable over the South pole area. but going out to

750
01:10:02,696 --> 01:10:07,716
things like Southern South America. so I was actually in the article as

751
01:10:07,716 --> 01:10:12,716
well. time of year. so

752
01:10:12,716 --> 01:10:18,236
you know there was this Nashville International action around Fanning.

753
01:10:18,236 --> 01:10:23,476
I was substituting for the use of these because your agent with the other agency could be used

754
01:10:23,476 --> 01:10:28,476
for accruing refrigeration and other such and what

755
01:10:28,476 --> 01:10:34,542
date. just reporting now I mean there were some reports before saying that there's been quite significant

756
01:10:34,542 --> 01:10:39,842
decrease in what's called hole. basically the area over there at Southern

757
01:10:39,842 --> 01:10:45,182
Latitude. it is very low. it's about something here. so this is on

758
01:10:45,182 --> 01:10:50,342
global success story. where that they didn't really require it could've been done

759
01:10:50,342 --> 01:10:55,902
by the US alone right to because did not Clark for

760
01:10:55,902 --> 01:11:00,942
floor floor is coming from Western Europe. to continue the problem. even

761
01:11:00,942 --> 01:11:06,722
if United_States example. alright. so just

762
01:11:06,722 --> 01:11:11,942
this is point out that often. I really and truly close issues

763
01:11:11,942 --> 01:11:17,262
court. the I don't really hear the current

764
01:11:17,262 --> 01:11:22,322
global issue. we're all facing. part of the change. this is

765
01:11:22,322 --> 01:11:27,642
this is a very really hectic time a chance is very specified area right as opposed

766
01:11:27,642 --> 01:11:32,902
to. we're getting gonna have higher average temperatures and that's gonna lead

767
01:11:32,902 --> 01:11:38,320
to increase severity rain storms

768
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:43,320
and her change in time. it also increase very dry out and it's going to melt all the

769
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:48,780
ice Castle. Steve is gonna arrive. so I like that.

770
01:11:48,780 --> 01:11:54,640
as I'm sure everyone is actually aware of in this room.

771
01:11:54,640 --> 01:12:00,040
I hope everyone is from believe that it's real good. it's not a conspiracy of six thousand

772
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:05,060
nine hundred and something different countries to just get more funding which.

773
01:12:05,060 --> 01:12:10,240
but if you believe it's Rio. this is probably going be solved in the national level

774
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:15,500
right. so it's very important to keep that in mind. you know something something have_to be approach globally

775
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:20,660
to be successful. we'll see what happens next with that one.

776
01:12:20,660 --> 01:12:25,960
alright. so just telling you more about.

777
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:30,960
you probably don't even care today I wouldn't if I was in there. hey this is Wayne that

778
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:36,554
works or if it's in the whole system if five different type of

779
01:12:36,554 --> 01:12:42,694
physician specialties. not very well known Tony specialties.

780
01:12:42,694 --> 01:12:53,254
and in fact.

781
01:12:53,254 --> 01:12:58,874
Norma this is Macy with the exception. well trained

782
01:12:58,874 --> 01:13:04,074
home owners position. the customer occupational lesson seven do postpone

783
01:13:04,074 --> 01:13:09,096
the exposure. but most of this I'm not well trained.

784
01:13:09,096 --> 01:13:14,516
I'm really sad about how to take a decent occupational history

785
01:13:14,516 --> 01:13:19,656
to figure out first of all they don't recognize Monday have a disease process in front of them that they need to rule

786
01:13:19,656 --> 01:13:24,696
out occupational con. often missed that and even if they don't

787
01:13:24,696 --> 01:13:29,696
miss it they don't really understand that we would ask about you know they need somebody like an industrial hygienist

788
01:13:29,696 --> 01:13:34,976
here at the elbow okay. well I'll try asking these questions. starting with exactly

789
01:13:34,976 --> 01:13:40,976
where you were just pricing for here. so I think it's not very

790
01:13:40,976 --> 01:13:46,396
pretty small specially it's not that well recognized. I think that's still true and

791
01:13:46,396 --> 01:13:51,676
if it might been a problem in the chance because there's a Navarathri

792
01:13:51,676 --> 01:13:57,136
level of knowledge among many different types especially when you get in touch with physicians.

793
01:13:57,136 --> 01:14:02,716
I suspect. well I know it but I saw the suspect of making sure your statics.

794
01:14:02,716 --> 01:14:07,971
I just it's very very cases of disease that Charlie.

795
01:14:07,971 --> 01:14:13,831
hey sorry to be so strong last patient components. I got handled correctly because the physician doesn't

796
01:14:13,831 --> 01:14:18,951
entertain that diagnosis doesn't know how to ask the right questions to figure out

797
01:14:18,951 --> 01:14:23,991
what to do next. okay. I'm

798
01:14:23,991 --> 01:14:29,311
gonna call this is give you a long history it's find out

799
01:14:29,311 --> 01:14:34,931
that there was appreciation of things but problems with

800
01:14:34,931 --> 01:14:39,951
people with their job like minors getting to see this accident that weren't seen

801
01:14:39,951 --> 01:14:44,991
going back hundreds of years. more examples

802
01:14:44,991 --> 01:14:50,851
of that and you know thought about a couple of names.

803
01:14:50,851 --> 01:14:55,891
I maybe able his room is a test before they will just sat down and saw that said never heard from the

804
01:14:55,891 --> 01:15:01,191
Dean of ram of Phoenix. so I'll see you but not most.

805
01:15:01,191 --> 01:15:06,391
saw a_lot_of people describe and that sort of the true father in occupational medicine. he

806
01:15:06,391 --> 01:15:11,525
was the first person this is very systematic way through

807
01:15:11,525 --> 01:15:17,505
always different types of work settings different types of jobs and reporting what he believed to be

808
01:15:17,505 --> 01:15:23,625
on this is in problems associated with those jobs. and you still

809
01:15:23,625 --> 01:15:28,745
you know have a copy of. it's not it's actually Harry it's Megan. I was gonna say

810
01:15:28,745 --> 01:15:33,905
is time. you can translate English that I could bring a copy of it it's

811
01:15:33,905 --> 01:15:39,785
very interested. so why I think he said

812
01:15:39,785 --> 01:15:46,365
he said if you wanna understand what's going on with you know this is. the first thing you have_to do.

813
01:15:46,365 --> 01:15:51,445
who's doing with her. and and just have a

814
01:15:51,445 --> 01:15:56,525
person to person exchange and just been talking about what they're working with

815
01:15:56,525 --> 01:16:02,405
and how they work with it. yeah. bye. to now.

816
01:16:02,405 --> 01:16:08,099
this is a bad time you know they were gonna start

817
01:16:08,099 --> 01:16:13,119
Rob this is already do with the usual reactions and so

818
01:16:13,119 --> 01:16:18,299
he can push the idea that you have_to be patient and asked a_lot_of questions the right

819
01:16:18,299 --> 01:16:23,359
questions and be open to different ways. agents might

820
01:16:23,359 --> 01:16:29,019
impact people and listen to the workers. it's actually come to the right conclusion.

821
01:16:29,019 --> 01:16:34,279
so that's probably a good place stop here.

822
01:16:34,279 --> 01:16:39,759
so I hope I hope. just got your message a little bit of a flavor

823
01:16:39,759 --> 01:16:45,899
of at least a little bit of mine.

824
01:16:45,899 --> 01:16:50,999
