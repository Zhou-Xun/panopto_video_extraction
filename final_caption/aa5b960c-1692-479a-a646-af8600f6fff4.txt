1
00:00:01,834 --> 00:00:07,744
All right. So 10 a.m. Let's get started here.

2
00:00:08,764 --> 00:00:24,583
Hello, everyone. Can you hear? I think I miss some of you who are in my energy and treasure, but many of you I see I see you first time.

3
00:00:24,584 --> 00:00:37,994
So I come to this after 642 and then if anyone who actually registers for 641 but sitting here, everyone.

4
00:00:38,354 --> 00:00:43,144
So now this section. So you're registered for 642, right?

5
00:00:43,394 --> 00:00:52,694
Okay. Okay. So before we start, I want to give you a brief, my introduction.

6
00:00:52,774 --> 00:01:04,724
So I am song jumper, associate professor in the department and my main research area is the environmental epidemiology.

7
00:01:04,754 --> 00:01:11,384
So I am mainly looking at, you know, how environmental chemical exposure,

8
00:01:11,384 --> 00:01:20,203
including air pollution or heavy metals or people's how many have for what purpose is there?

9
00:01:20,204 --> 00:01:22,214
Is that many okay.

10
00:01:23,054 --> 00:01:31,804
In Michigan people plus is so important when you drink water you want to make sure that so my drinking water and not contaminate with

11
00:01:31,814 --> 00:01:42,553
people so there is going to be a chance that I can introduce this story in this class and how this involved the chemical you know,

12
00:01:42,554 --> 00:01:49,214
impact our health including cardiovascular disease, ideal high Ms. disease type two diabetes.

13
00:01:49,364 --> 00:01:56,833
So those are what I am doing. So and also I will have a chance to introduce some of my study.

14
00:01:56,834 --> 00:02:00,374
So a study of women's health across the nation.

15
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:03,974
How many have over one study before?

16
00:02:04,754 --> 00:02:10,184
This is one of the cohort study that you know our what department so many

17
00:02:10,184 --> 00:02:14,334
faculty member are involved with this cohort study and then we are doing that.

18
00:02:14,504 --> 00:02:24,974
So not many. Right. Okay. So I would have a chance to introduce that study, as it were, so over this semester.

19
00:02:24,974 --> 00:02:30,253
So this is a seven week class, not poor semester.

20
00:02:30,254 --> 00:02:39,964
So it's it's going to be very short, but hopefully we have a good interaction and then get to know each other throughout this class.

21
00:02:41,994 --> 00:02:45,343
Okay. So, um. Okay.

22
00:02:45,344 --> 00:02:51,614
So this is one credit seven week course, but please make sure that this is the equivalent to two credit.

23
00:02:52,064 --> 00:02:55,094
Okay. So sometimes I heard that.

24
00:02:55,514 --> 00:02:57,144
Oh, so there are two.

25
00:02:57,164 --> 00:03:06,584
Too much work, even even though this is a one credit and this is because this is one credit, but you have to finish up this within seven weeks.

26
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:11,114
So that's why the total amount of war is equivalent to two credit.

27
00:03:11,354 --> 00:03:22,604
Okay. So make sure we are meeting Tuesday 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and in this room and last year,

28
00:03:22,604 --> 00:03:31,754
as you know that so the covariant that we adjust accommodate you know your attendance through the making this as a hybrid.

29
00:03:32,624 --> 00:03:41,954
And then whenever I come here only one or two citizens were sitting here and the most of them were just joining this course through Zoom.

30
00:03:42,104 --> 00:03:47,714
So and also the school decide, you know, this year.

31
00:03:47,744 --> 00:03:53,203
So making all the classes so not the big class but most of the classes are in-person.

32
00:03:53,204 --> 00:03:56,384
So that's why I will also use this.

33
00:03:57,134 --> 00:04:05,533
So the maintain this as a in-person class and then I will have another slide to talk about the class policies.

34
00:04:05,534 --> 00:04:13,964
I'm going to talk about that later. So if you have any concerns, don't hesitate to just shoot on email to me during this.

35
00:04:13,964 --> 00:04:21,524
So why you are taking this class and even after you have of course related to this class, then I will be happy to answer.

36
00:04:22,964 --> 00:04:27,044
And our GSI Daesh want me? Who is this student?

37
00:04:27,164 --> 00:04:30,194
And then so she is GSI.

38
00:04:30,614 --> 00:04:35,384
She does GSI for two classes, 641 and 642.

39
00:04:35,414 --> 00:04:40,214
So she will she is now in 641 and then second half,

40
00:04:40,484 --> 00:04:48,434
so around 11 a.m. So she will come to this class and she will introduce herself later and her office hour.

41
00:04:48,704 --> 00:04:54,853
So Friday between ten and 12 p.m. So this is a zoom of this hour.

42
00:04:54,854 --> 00:05:02,024
So if you have any question either in this class and when you switch to 641 second,

43
00:05:02,414 --> 00:05:09,104
second half of this winter semester, then please go to that office hour and then ask her.

44
00:05:10,884 --> 00:05:14,754
Okay. Class policy. So this is in person.

45
00:05:15,864 --> 00:05:19,144
But I will also introduce the class of schedule.

46
00:05:19,164 --> 00:05:26,184
And then in week four we will have a group project and because you will be assigned

47
00:05:26,184 --> 00:05:32,514
to a group and then you will work together to answer the question that I am asking.

48
00:05:32,904 --> 00:05:38,933
And then because I don't think this is a this room is good for doing the group project.

49
00:05:38,934 --> 00:05:45,413
And then when we did this group project through the Zoom last year and then actually the group

50
00:05:45,414 --> 00:05:50,034
process was working very well through the Zoom and then you are assigned to a breakout room.

51
00:05:50,034 --> 00:05:54,294
So that's why the week will be Zoom.

52
00:05:54,894 --> 00:05:56,454
Okay, so group project.

53
00:05:57,144 --> 00:06:10,913
So we will meet in Zoom and then so you will have worked together in breakout room there if you as of I don't need to repeat all over this,

54
00:06:10,914 --> 00:06:19,884
but if you are sick and have any, you know, if you are not comfortable to attend class in person, then please email me.

55
00:06:19,884 --> 00:06:32,154
Hopefully you emailed me a day before, but you know, in the morning on the day of this class and if you if you do not feel good, then please email me.

56
00:06:32,154 --> 00:06:36,834
So then stay home. And then right now this lecture is recording.

57
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:47,664
So after the class, I will post this recording to the the Canva so you can watch this asynchronous and then if you have to miss the class.

58
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:51,494
Okay. And then there is no penalty.

59
00:06:51,824 --> 00:06:57,134
Not attending class. It doesn't mean that you have to miss all the classes.

60
00:06:57,164 --> 00:07:01,094
Right. Please. Okay. But just in case.

61
00:07:01,094 --> 00:07:04,644
If we'll see. And. But I will not ask.

62
00:07:04,904 --> 00:07:10,524
So why you have to miss. Okay. So don't feel uncomfortable.

63
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:16,034
So just, you know, e-mail me that if you are sick and if you have to come to the class.

64
00:07:16,124 --> 00:07:21,134
Okay. So wearing a mask is not mandatory.

65
00:07:21,134 --> 00:07:27,134
But as you also know, that this case of another variant of COVID is surging.

66
00:07:27,134 --> 00:07:33,194
And so in case score, a policy change that I may ask you to wear a mask.

67
00:07:34,694 --> 00:07:43,624
And sometimes when I give a lecture with a mask on and that's why you are not you are not sure what I am talking about.

68
00:07:43,634 --> 00:07:49,754
So then please raise your hand. I would try to say repeat what I just mentioned.

69
00:07:50,564 --> 00:07:56,814
And also when you ask Commander, if I if I'm not sure what you are asking, then I may also ask you.

70
00:07:56,864 --> 00:08:03,464
Okay. So. And your question about the class policy to this COVID 19.

71
00:08:04,334 --> 00:08:08,284
Good. Okay. All right.

72
00:08:08,994 --> 00:08:20,034
So this course. So now you completed AP 600, which is our core introductory labor and premium exam.

73
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:23,874
Right. So what's the next step? So you have to apply, right?

74
00:08:24,354 --> 00:08:28,494
You'll learn how to do a piece study. Right. And then you have to apply.

75
00:08:28,524 --> 00:08:38,924
So that's why this is one of the field of study in that immunology, which means that when you want to conduct on AP study how to send.

76
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:45,994
So how to recruit people. And then what is the the sampling approach we can use?

77
00:08:46,294 --> 00:08:52,474
And then when you sampler and then compare to like a sample versus your target population,

78
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:57,304
what a potential problem when you needed that sample approach.

79
00:08:57,724 --> 00:08:59,644
And then one other statistical issue.

80
00:09:00,034 --> 00:09:10,924
So this course, we will be talking about this, how the how to design a survey using this sampling approach and then,

81
00:09:11,524 --> 00:09:15,513
you know, the non probability sampling and the probability sampling.

82
00:09:15,514 --> 00:09:20,084
So we will talk about the details of each different sampling approach later.

83
00:09:20,584 --> 00:09:26,884
So convenience sampling or sample random selection so you may have heard about is different types of sampling.

84
00:09:27,274 --> 00:09:34,624
But not only we we go over what it what it is, but more important one is how to do that.

85
00:09:35,224 --> 00:09:41,554
So throughout this class so we made a practice of how to conduct this type of this different sampling approach.

86
00:09:42,814 --> 00:09:51,104
And then the second piece of this course is, so when you design your study, how many sample to be here, right?

87
00:09:51,214 --> 00:09:55,794
So that's another important piece when you design your study.

88
00:09:55,804 --> 00:10:05,134
So that's why the, the whole goal of this class is now you learn all the details of FP from 600.

89
00:10:05,254 --> 00:10:07,114
So what is the epidemiology?

90
00:10:07,114 --> 00:10:13,864
And then if you want to conduct that FP study what component you have to consider and the among many different components.

91
00:10:14,194 --> 00:10:18,184
This course we would talk about sampling and synthesize calculation.

92
00:10:18,604 --> 00:10:23,554
Okay, so those are two major goal we want to achieve after the class.

93
00:10:26,194 --> 00:10:30,064
Okay. So that's why, of course, competencies are these.

94
00:10:30,454 --> 00:10:39,904
We will cover this basic aspects of field the method but specifically choose and design appropriate sampling method.

95
00:10:41,114 --> 00:10:47,914
Depending on different study design. Okay. And then compute the center size or even the same percent.

96
00:10:47,924 --> 00:10:53,294
What what is the expected of power? And then we will also talk about what is the power later?

97
00:10:56,844 --> 00:11:01,854
So prerequisites. I believe all of you or most of you.

98
00:11:02,064 --> 00:11:05,064
So now you have taken AP 600.

99
00:11:05,274 --> 00:11:09,474
But I also know that there are a few bias tests done.

100
00:11:09,864 --> 00:11:16,794
So that's why the other equivalent levers of introductory epidemiology are require.

101
00:11:17,974 --> 00:11:21,874
And also we will be using SAS as a statistical program.

102
00:11:22,354 --> 00:11:25,954
So if you are not. So everyone take 640. Right.

103
00:11:26,284 --> 00:11:30,704
Okay. So we assume that you already know how to use them.

104
00:11:30,914 --> 00:11:36,634
Okay. So hopefully there is no problem when you open and they use the SAS.

105
00:11:37,634 --> 00:11:43,504
And also we were. So we will use some statistical approach.

106
00:11:43,534 --> 00:11:47,944
So after use sample and the using the sample, you will analyze the data.

107
00:11:48,034 --> 00:11:57,693
So that's why we will apply. For example, proc means crop frac, crop frac or program logistic.

108
00:11:57,694 --> 00:12:01,114
So some of those approaches that we will be using. I know that.

109
00:12:01,114 --> 00:12:07,714
So not all of these outputs recover in 640, but you are now taking six or two.

110
00:12:08,404 --> 00:12:17,794
Right. So from the six or two, you will be also learning about different types of statistical method and then how to use that apply that in SAS.

111
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:22,834
Right. So this course also do that, some of the analysis.

112
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:31,144
Okay. So course materials. So actually there is no textbook you have to buy.

113
00:12:31,354 --> 00:12:40,804
So the textbook I recommend specifically for this design in clinical research is this wholly textbook, which is very good textbook.

114
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:45,524
And this textbook is available in the, um, library.

115
00:12:45,544 --> 00:12:50,524
So just click this link or this link is also available in the syllabus.

116
00:12:50,794 --> 00:12:55,774
So go there and then link and then the full text of this text below available.

117
00:12:56,374 --> 00:13:03,754
And then I already saw this class not cover the entire textbook, but we are covering some chapters.

118
00:13:04,024 --> 00:13:08,944
And then I already pulled the PDF file of each, the chapter that we are covering.

119
00:13:09,214 --> 00:13:13,764
And then those have a PDF file will be posted in the canvas.

120
00:13:13,864 --> 00:13:17,854
So some chapter we are covering in this class.

121
00:13:17,974 --> 00:13:20,734
So you can directly get the pdf from the canvas.

122
00:13:21,004 --> 00:13:28,234
So if we are interested in other area, then go to this textbook through the, um, library and then you can see that.

123
00:13:28,444 --> 00:13:33,664
Okay. And also we have a few papers that I will ask you to read.

124
00:13:36,844 --> 00:13:42,004
Okay. So of course schedule. So today I will give you this course overview.

125
00:13:42,994 --> 00:13:53,014
So they tried the app study design and then later probably we have to take some short break and then we will have the assembling fraction by design.

126
00:13:53,674 --> 00:13:57,064
And then so each week we will have a lab component.

127
00:13:57,644 --> 00:14:02,163
Okay. So the today we will have a this is one exercise.

128
00:14:02,164 --> 00:14:12,004
Everyone has either laptop or tablet so you can access or today even you can use your phone to take to the Prius.

129
00:14:12,154 --> 00:14:18,693
Yeah, but starting from next week so I would not recommend so.

130
00:14:18,694 --> 00:14:23,614
Or students are required to bring your laptop to do this exercise.

131
00:14:23,854 --> 00:14:33,093
So if you need a laptop, please after the class, please email me and then I will find out if the department has any.

132
00:14:33,094 --> 00:14:36,184
I like a laptop that rent to you. Okay.

133
00:14:37,774 --> 00:14:42,394
And then starting from week two. So this is kind of the flipped class.

134
00:14:43,194 --> 00:14:48,174
So that's why it's where you have a pre class or line lecture.

135
00:14:49,494 --> 00:14:58,583
So you have to watch the online lecture before the class and then after watching the the this recording.

136
00:14:58,584 --> 00:15:04,604
And then you will need to take a quiz. So actually that replays your attendance.

137
00:15:05,824 --> 00:15:10,654
Okay. And then there is no you cannot have multiple times.

138
00:15:10,684 --> 00:15:14,014
So if you get a wrong answer, just keep trying. Okay.

139
00:15:14,404 --> 00:15:18,393
Does it mean that you have to randomly select from A to eat?

140
00:15:18,394 --> 00:15:21,784
Right. That's not what I am. I want you to do that.

141
00:15:21,814 --> 00:15:25,474
Okay. So I've read the lecture. So what's the lecture?

142
00:15:26,224 --> 00:15:31,894
Video. And then I will also provide the the like a PowerPoint slide.

143
00:15:32,134 --> 00:15:35,464
And then you go over and then take the quiz. Okay.

144
00:15:35,614 --> 00:15:39,214
But if you get a wrong answer, it's okay. Just keep trying.

145
00:15:39,604 --> 00:15:43,294
Okay. So the this quiz.

146
00:15:43,804 --> 00:15:50,784
So I will talk about that, how this course will be graded later about this criticize.

147
00:15:52,564 --> 00:16:01,304
So the week to this non probability sampling and then the first part of the probability sampling and the week three.

148
00:16:01,624 --> 00:16:09,004
Then the rest of the probability sampling. So a more advanced sampling strategy, including stratified essentially, and then cluster sampling.

149
00:16:09,304 --> 00:16:14,944
And then each week we will also cover that. So you watch the video and then come here.

150
00:16:16,114 --> 00:16:23,464
So we will have some the review of what you what but we will directly go to the SAS application.

151
00:16:23,884 --> 00:16:28,024
Okay. So I will provide a data which is the data.

152
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:31,654
And then from the data you will center. Okay.

153
00:16:31,714 --> 00:16:35,224
That is what we will be doing in the classroom. Okay.

154
00:16:35,284 --> 00:16:40,074
So you have to watch the video and then come here and then we will do that lap component.

155
00:16:41,104 --> 00:16:48,064
We explore again group projects. I will give you some question.

156
00:16:48,064 --> 00:16:51,634
So how to. So I will give you some scenario.

157
00:16:51,784 --> 00:16:54,784
And the given the scenario, you are designing on that piece study.

158
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:58,674
Okay. So that that is what this group project is doing.

159
00:16:59,224 --> 00:17:02,674
So then the question is because this is a sampling in simplicity.

160
00:17:02,704 --> 00:17:06,544
So that's one less sampling method you want to try.

161
00:17:06,844 --> 00:17:10,364
Given that study setting or given that research.

162
00:17:11,674 --> 00:17:15,574
And then you have to justify why I want to use that sampling approach.

163
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:20,164
Okay. And how many I want to do that? I want to center.

164
00:17:20,524 --> 00:17:24,514
So that is what you will be doing this group project. So it's a very fun project.

165
00:17:26,274 --> 00:17:34,464
And then the week five. And then you learn about the study design and the one of the beauty of this AP study,

166
00:17:34,764 --> 00:17:42,464
especially when you are looking at very rare disease, it's a case study is, you know, beauty of peace study.

167
00:17:42,484 --> 00:17:47,604
Right. So that's why then the problem is you identify cases.

168
00:17:48,024 --> 00:17:55,074
The question is who should a survey is a control and how to select the control is a big issue.

169
00:17:55,134 --> 00:18:03,084
Right? So that's why we have to find the right control group to make a fair comparison between cases and control.

170
00:18:03,384 --> 00:18:08,964
So that's like the sampling of this control is, is a methodologically very important issue.

171
00:18:09,744 --> 00:18:15,083
And then so that's why now not only does general sampling approach we cover in week two,

172
00:18:15,084 --> 00:18:21,564
in week three, but we will more focus on sampling strategies in case control design in week five.

173
00:18:21,964 --> 00:18:31,344
Okay. So that's why at the time we will do matching. So you learn what is the matching in case control study right from 600.

174
00:18:32,564 --> 00:18:41,774
So then we will actually do the matching and the how matching works and, and the impact of matching in causal input.

175
00:18:42,104 --> 00:18:49,214
So that will be our lab and then we exit and then we are moving to the asset precise empower.

176
00:18:49,514 --> 00:18:54,434
So depending on different outcome characteristics or study design or statistical method

177
00:18:54,674 --> 00:18:59,294
and then we will cover in this many different types of simplicity and calculation.

178
00:19:00,284 --> 00:19:10,004
And that final week, actually the final week will be also you don't need to come to the class because I will have

179
00:19:10,014 --> 00:19:20,174
a very brief wrap up of this class and then you can start taking final exam through campus.

180
00:19:20,704 --> 00:19:24,824
Okay. So the step week seven is taking final exam.

181
00:19:26,684 --> 00:19:29,894
So I have a final. Okay.

182
00:19:30,314 --> 00:19:33,554
So the final exam. So.

183
00:19:34,534 --> 00:19:39,834
You can as long. So it's okay as long as you take your complete final exam within the day.

184
00:19:39,844 --> 00:19:45,004
So I will open this final exam around ten, ten, 15 a.m.

185
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:48,874
So as long as you finish your final exam until the midnight.

186
00:19:49,444 --> 00:19:53,044
Okay, so you can take any time. It is open but.

187
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:59,024
You don't need to memorize. And even you can use any resources.

188
00:19:59,804 --> 00:20:02,954
I don't care what resources in the Yemen. Okay.

189
00:20:03,784 --> 00:20:08,214
Uh, but don't. Don't don't text.

190
00:20:08,384 --> 00:20:14,404
Okay. You have to just work yourself independently and then try, use.

191
00:20:14,894 --> 00:20:18,244
Try your best to do it. Take this. Fine with them.

192
00:20:20,624 --> 00:20:22,634
Okay. So the course requirement,

193
00:20:22,634 --> 00:20:35,624
the grading and each this pre class creates 5% so that's why so I'm not grading is based on the number of correct answer and such as completion.

194
00:20:36,674 --> 00:20:40,444
As long as you complain, it's okay. Okay.

195
00:20:41,704 --> 00:20:45,484
But try your best to get the correct answer.

196
00:20:45,754 --> 00:20:59,054
Okay. And this is why I see because I know your score and sometimes I see that and also I see the, you know, how long it took to complete your career.

197
00:20:59,294 --> 00:21:03,734
And then sometime I see that it if it was completed within 5 seconds.

198
00:21:04,664 --> 00:21:09,524
Right, which means there is a over multiple choices you just randomly select, right?

199
00:21:10,484 --> 00:21:15,064
Steve I give you full credit. But don't do that.

200
00:21:15,184 --> 00:21:18,274
Okay? It's your job. It's not my job.

201
00:21:18,304 --> 00:21:23,734
Right. So if you. You can get full credit, but you don't get anything.

202
00:21:24,424 --> 00:21:28,904
Right. So 5% for Christmas.

203
00:21:29,414 --> 00:21:34,034
And then, as I said, we will have a in class led activity.

204
00:21:35,064 --> 00:21:36,974
And then that is also 5%.

205
00:21:36,984 --> 00:21:46,284
So each time I will give you a data set and using the data say use Sempre and then using the sample you run analysis and then you,

206
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:53,844
you answer your party. What is the prevalence of, for example, a certain disease in the population?

207
00:21:54,414 --> 00:21:57,504
And then you are answering that to the later.

208
00:21:57,504 --> 00:22:03,804
I will show you how to report that. So that is also the this 5%.

209
00:22:04,104 --> 00:22:14,364
So this is why if you have to me is the class, which means that you are not able to complete this class within the class time, right?

210
00:22:14,664 --> 00:22:20,864
So that's why you have to inform me. So imagine me before so that I can see that you are missing the class, but.

211
00:22:20,874 --> 00:22:28,634
And then I can accommodate your time so your deadline can be pushed back on to like a following me.

212
00:22:28,884 --> 00:22:36,623
But please try to attend in person group project 30% so 25% reports.

213
00:22:36,624 --> 00:22:43,044
I will review your report and then that will that will be 25%.

214
00:22:43,044 --> 00:22:50,964
And then I think each. So depending on how many are in this class, you I think we have about 32 done.

215
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:58,944
So either three or most student will work together and then we will have our this evaluation.

216
00:23:00,274 --> 00:23:05,494
And the final quiz again with seven and then there will be 30, uh,

217
00:23:06,214 --> 00:23:12,364
so about 20 multiple choice question and then there are ten locations after you select,

218
00:23:12,844 --> 00:23:20,194
you know, correct answer and then I will ask you, so why you chose that answer or what is the justification of your, your answer?

219
00:23:20,434 --> 00:23:25,624
Something like that. Um. Okay.

220
00:23:26,894 --> 00:23:30,614
Any question in terms of the course of logistics.

221
00:23:33,584 --> 00:23:38,084
Good. Good. All right, let's get started.

222
00:23:39,294 --> 00:23:44,843
So then again today we will go over the study, the speed of the research design,

223
00:23:44,844 --> 00:23:54,594
and then so what we will be doing over this seven weeks and then this is so the details of today's lecture,

224
00:23:54,594 --> 00:23:58,404
you can find this from the chapter one, which is already posted on in.

225
00:24:00,174 --> 00:24:03,534
Chapter one of this, fully a textbook. Okay.

226
00:24:03,924 --> 00:24:07,954
What is the epidemiologic? From 600.

227
00:24:07,964 --> 00:24:14,714
So don't look at don't look at your slide. Just what is the epidemiologist does your understanding.

228
00:24:17,204 --> 00:24:20,234
The more what you learn from 600.

229
00:24:22,724 --> 00:24:26,294
What is the epidemiology? Why you are doing it? Epidemiologist.

230
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:38,574
Yep. This is the origin of the study of the distribution of disease or different health inequities.

231
00:24:40,634 --> 00:24:48,524
You know, can you say that at the end or different health inequities within the population living apart from.

232
00:24:48,774 --> 00:24:52,564
Okay. What is your name? That's Vincent.

233
00:24:52,674 --> 00:24:56,324
Vincent. Okay. Vincent said distribution.

234
00:24:57,404 --> 00:25:09,283
And then distribution of the disease or her that quippy inappropriate way the Vinson cuts all the important component of this actually

235
00:25:09,284 --> 00:25:18,174
epidemiologic definition so distribution which is important concept and the component of epidemiology and also the population.

236
00:25:18,194 --> 00:25:20,234
Right. So that's a perfect answer.

237
00:25:21,574 --> 00:25:28,324
So that's why the, you know, different textbook, you know, provides some different definition of epidemiology, but mostly the same thing.

238
00:25:28,324 --> 00:25:37,444
So the study of the occurrence and distribution of health related states or events or disease in specified population,

239
00:25:38,914 --> 00:25:45,544
or study of how disease is distributed in population and the factors that influence or

240
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:51,454
determine this distribution or application of the scientific method to health research.

241
00:25:53,394 --> 00:26:01,284
All right. But I want to use this, you know the definition, but I want to go further.

242
00:26:02,124 --> 00:26:08,324
Let's do a little bit more. So then epidemiologist we want to address this.

243
00:26:08,334 --> 00:26:12,384
So the distribution of smoking. Smoking status.

244
00:26:12,684 --> 00:26:18,834
How many people smoke at this point? Right. But we are not able to examine the entire population.

245
00:26:18,864 --> 00:26:24,684
Right. Ideally, if we really want to know what is the prevalence of current smoking.

246
00:26:25,314 --> 00:26:30,834
So then ideally what you have to do, you have to survey the entire population.

247
00:26:30,864 --> 00:26:36,384
Right. And then see who are us, who smoke and who do not smoke.

248
00:26:36,564 --> 00:26:40,864
And they using that information, you can get the correct answer.

249
00:26:40,884 --> 00:26:45,384
So 10% of people are smoke or 20% smoke.

250
00:26:45,414 --> 00:26:50,244
Right. But we are not able to survey the entire population.

251
00:26:50,544 --> 00:26:54,764
So then what we do, what we do is we sample.

252
00:26:55,744 --> 00:27:02,254
Not the entire population. Right. We look at only a small subset of the population we are interested in.

253
00:27:03,264 --> 00:27:06,744
So that's why after you her and then you survey.

254
00:27:07,814 --> 00:27:19,734
Let's say only 1000 people. Right. But from the information from those 1000, what you intend to say is that the prevalence of smoking in 300 million.

255
00:27:19,754 --> 00:27:22,784
Something like that. Right. That's. That is what your intention.

256
00:27:23,114 --> 00:27:26,714
But we are not looking at 300 million. We look at only 1000.

257
00:27:27,134 --> 00:27:38,554
Right. So that's why this is an inference is that. You are using information from a small subset who you believe represent your target population.

258
00:27:38,944 --> 00:27:42,064
Right. And then using that information, you make inference.

259
00:27:42,574 --> 00:27:49,014
What is the prevalence of smoking? So that's why this is how epidemiologists work.

260
00:27:50,314 --> 00:27:56,444
Okay. So that's what I want to redefine, just using the concept.

261
00:27:56,454 --> 00:28:08,604
And then, you know, gender definition of epidemiology, we learn from the textbook science to make an inference from samples to the population.

262
00:28:09,474 --> 00:28:15,764
Hey, this is. Keep your. Inference from Semper to the population.

263
00:28:16,644 --> 00:28:23,064
Okay. In terms of how this is distributed and the factors that influence or determine this distribution.

264
00:28:23,784 --> 00:28:24,054
Okay.

265
00:28:24,564 --> 00:28:34,764
So from 642, well, even beyond 642, I really want you to understand and to make sure that what is happening with how we want to do this app emerges.

266
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:39,984
We are not looking at the entire population. We cannot do that. We have no money.

267
00:28:39,984 --> 00:28:44,274
We have no staff to do the survey, the entire population.

268
00:28:45,054 --> 00:28:50,064
It's not very ethical. It's not very efficient. Just using small subset.

269
00:28:50,454 --> 00:28:54,894
But believe this small subset represent what we want to examine.

270
00:28:55,134 --> 00:28:59,314
Right. All right.

271
00:29:00,504 --> 00:29:11,664
So based on this, you know, the idea of epidemiology and let's think of us, you know, conducting and designing a study.

272
00:29:12,174 --> 00:29:20,684
So assuming that you are the principal investigator of a research team, so that's why you want to come up on study.

273
00:29:20,694 --> 00:29:24,534
So, you know, any, any topic or COVID 19 or whatever.

274
00:29:25,044 --> 00:29:30,594
So then what do we need in order to conduct epi study, epi research?

275
00:29:30,684 --> 00:29:37,944
So what are the what are the elements of research? So to design a study, what do you need?

276
00:29:42,844 --> 00:29:46,434
Research. Right. So you have some idea.

277
00:29:46,454 --> 00:29:49,654
So what? You want to address what you want to answer.

278
00:29:50,014 --> 00:29:53,854
So you want the research person, and then what is?

279
00:29:57,374 --> 00:30:04,454
Population, target population. Right. So this research person is from this population.

280
00:30:04,754 --> 00:30:09,194
And then probably after the end of the clap. So end of the research and the.

281
00:30:09,194 --> 00:30:18,253
You want to fix some problem. Right. So that's why the what what problem is in that specific population.

282
00:30:18,254 --> 00:30:22,784
And then so that's why you are examining this specific population. So that's a unit of population.

283
00:30:23,444 --> 00:30:28,224
What is. Think of epidemiologic distribution.

284
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:34,694
Of what? Destruction of.

285
00:30:37,814 --> 00:30:41,294
This is expose error. Right.

286
00:30:41,594 --> 00:30:44,804
So that's why that what is there? Research of coercion.

287
00:30:45,284 --> 00:30:55,844
So epidemiologic research, coercion is the relationship between exposure and outbreak, whether this specific exposure cause the desire.

288
00:30:55,934 --> 00:31:04,324
Right. And then because we are not. We are not doing our experimental study so that so we cannot expose population.

289
00:31:04,954 --> 00:31:08,254
But instead of doing that, we are observing.

290
00:31:08,494 --> 00:31:19,563
Right. Okay. Anything else? After you collect that, they collect information.

291
00:31:19,564 --> 00:31:28,314
Data. What you have to do. They analyze the data, analyze the data.

292
00:31:28,334 --> 00:31:32,654
So that's why what you need to know is how to analyze the data.

293
00:31:32,774 --> 00:31:36,794
Right. Okay. So those are all the component of research.

294
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:41,294
And then when you propose your study, you have to include all that information.

295
00:31:41,594 --> 00:31:49,434
Okay. All right. So then let's begin from Research Kitchen and here is an example.

296
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:55,224
So should people eat more face? Do you like this culture?

297
00:31:56,954 --> 00:32:03,544
Why not? Why you don't like this culture? Nothing specific in terms of what.

298
00:32:05,314 --> 00:32:09,604
Who are we talking about? What type of such stuff then?

299
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:14,434
Like, what is. What is our measure of success?

300
00:32:15,644 --> 00:32:23,464
But that's good. So we are not sure who that people are or fears or more.

301
00:32:24,214 --> 00:32:28,954
So then you want to say more that you have to you have to have a some retrospective, right?

302
00:32:29,524 --> 00:32:34,534
So then more than what reference venue. So that's why this concern is not very specific.

303
00:32:34,544 --> 00:32:38,494
But when you start your study, maybe this is okay,

304
00:32:38,554 --> 00:32:48,234
you start from this very broad question and then you try to narrow down what you really want to answer.

305
00:32:49,824 --> 00:32:53,944
So that's why. How often do Americans eat fish?

306
00:32:54,234 --> 00:32:57,594
So that's why you specify. So not just any people.

307
00:32:57,894 --> 00:33:02,304
Americans. And then you want to answer how often?

308
00:33:03,724 --> 00:33:08,224
And then does eating fish lower the risk of CVD? So what is the intention of this question?

309
00:33:08,854 --> 00:33:13,684
So the eating fears reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.

310
00:33:14,044 --> 00:33:23,014
CVD stand for cardiovascular disease. And how much of fish intake can lower the risk of severe.

311
00:33:23,044 --> 00:33:29,404
So that's why the you want to answer what again at the end of the research and that you want to recommend.

312
00:33:30,034 --> 00:33:39,534
So how much you have to eat? You have to eat. Is there a risk of mercury toxicity from increasing fish intake in order of dirt?

313
00:33:39,744 --> 00:33:50,484
So some of you may know that fish is a good obviously, but some, you know, the right predator also have this mercury.

314
00:33:50,694 --> 00:33:57,084
So that's why eating fish could be a source of, you know, you can be exposed to this mercury.

315
00:33:57,444 --> 00:34:04,764
So that's why you have to make sure some balance between, you know, this benefit or risk of fish intake.

316
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:12,134
And then do fish oil supplements have the same effect on CBD as dietary fish?

317
00:34:12,144 --> 00:34:19,934
So you can easily take just by your fish or your supplement pill and then you can eat that, right?

318
00:34:20,234 --> 00:34:30,884
You can just take that up here. So the question is this supplement has a same or similar beneficial effect as dietary fish.

319
00:34:31,064 --> 00:34:37,874
So you can so you can start from this broader picture, but later you can narrow down and then replace,

320
00:34:38,114 --> 00:34:41,314
and then eventually you can have a much better research question.

321
00:34:42,804 --> 00:34:51,344
So when you're, you know, the police and then, you know, the create your research question, you can think about this criteria.

322
00:34:51,354 --> 00:34:57,234
So we call this a finer criteria for good research person and you you need to think

323
00:34:57,234 --> 00:35:05,114
about this feasibility Sophie's over interesting novel or at the core relevant so

324
00:35:05,124 --> 00:35:13,404
all of those criteria so you want to include especially these days so the question

325
00:35:13,404 --> 00:35:17,694
is whether or not this person is not so you do not want to reinvent the wheel.

326
00:35:17,934 --> 00:35:24,114
So somebody already answer that you do not want to do that right and how interesting the study

327
00:35:24,114 --> 00:35:29,624
Christian years but not only that but also whether or not your research question is at the core.

328
00:35:29,724 --> 00:35:31,914
Right. So you should be very careful.

329
00:35:33,054 --> 00:35:40,244
And in terms of the lack of funding agency, you know, the point of view this feeds over and relevant or so very important.

330
00:35:40,254 --> 00:35:50,204
So that's why even though your idea is so good, but sometimes too ambitious and then is too expensive, right?

331
00:35:50,424 --> 00:35:56,584
So it's not very good. You know, research goes on and then your funding agency may not fund your study.

332
00:35:56,614 --> 00:36:00,684
So that's why those are really important component when you design your study.

333
00:36:03,314 --> 00:36:07,314
Okay. So this is why the outline of the study protocol.

334
00:36:07,324 --> 00:36:08,613
So when you design your study,

335
00:36:08,614 --> 00:36:15,574
you will need to think over this research question and then based on the research question and then you do literature review.

336
00:36:15,634 --> 00:36:21,514
So what are the background underlying this research question and the why this question is important?

337
00:36:22,084 --> 00:36:30,334
And then was a component of your introduction or background section of your research proposal, and then you design your study.

338
00:36:30,694 --> 00:36:37,954
And at that time you need to think about this time frame and then epidemiologic approach, how the study is structure.

339
00:36:38,254 --> 00:36:41,254
So you measure explosion outcome at the same time,

340
00:36:41,254 --> 00:36:46,924
or you recruit people who are free of the specific disease of interest and then

341
00:36:46,924 --> 00:36:52,624
you measure exposure first and then followed up your center over the next,

342
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:56,914
let's say three years and then see what happen. Right.

343
00:36:57,274 --> 00:37:02,964
So that's why based on those those design and then use the lab who who are eligible for another

344
00:37:02,974 --> 00:37:09,214
resolver and then at that time so we consider and then putting this sampling strategy into this step.

345
00:37:09,634 --> 00:37:18,244
And then what kind of variable you want to collect. So outcome, exposure, predictor and additional variable, including this confounding.

346
00:37:18,604 --> 00:37:22,954
And then you would need to think over this how to analyze those very variables.

347
00:37:23,314 --> 00:37:33,784
So statistical issue. So this 642 will cover, you know, how these people will be selected and then how large the study is.

348
00:37:34,324 --> 00:37:38,884
And then after seven week. And then when you move to 641.

349
00:37:40,104 --> 00:37:47,244
And that you will learn of how to design an instrument to measure exposure outcome.

350
00:37:47,514 --> 00:37:50,724
And so. Right. So that's how to design your questionnaire.

351
00:37:51,834 --> 00:37:55,464
And then when you design questionnaire, what, what component you have to think of.

352
00:37:55,794 --> 00:38:02,874
Right. So the validity, reliability, probably you learn those concepts from 600.

353
00:38:03,294 --> 00:38:09,504
But the 641 will cover the details of those validity and reliability.

354
00:38:12,744 --> 00:38:20,024
So the background is significant. So those are the when you open your proposer and then that's what you will see.

355
00:38:20,304 --> 00:38:26,124
So that's why you have to provide information about what is known about the specific research.

356
00:38:26,934 --> 00:38:29,934
And what are research gap? So what is unknown?

357
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:36,384
So why the research question is important? And then what kind of answer the study provide?

358
00:38:38,764 --> 00:38:44,074
So they try to, you know, fill these piers and then you have to do this literature review.

359
00:38:44,374 --> 00:38:49,354
So literature review is a compilation of the research book.

360
00:38:50,524 --> 00:38:55,864
And then this is important. So literature review is a critical evaluation.

361
00:38:56,404 --> 00:39:00,364
You have to synthesize and then provide this.

362
00:39:00,994 --> 00:39:06,934
So literature review is not just an annotated bibliography.

363
00:39:08,404 --> 00:39:14,584
So you just read in the paper. So the first or third year of the publication Journal name.

364
00:39:14,864 --> 00:39:19,714
And what is the summary of that paper and the move to the next paper?

365
00:39:20,284 --> 00:39:26,284
That's not literature, right? So literature review, as you read all those, you know,

366
00:39:26,284 --> 00:39:35,044
the papers and then you have to synthesize and critical evaluate and then draw conclusions from the paper.

367
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:44,464
What is known, what is unknown. Okay. It's not just a descriptive list of the material available or set of summaries.

368
00:39:47,954 --> 00:39:52,094
So why do our literature review again? So to identify gap.

369
00:39:52,214 --> 00:39:56,914
So we research a gap in the literature and then to avoid reinvent the wheel.

370
00:39:56,924 --> 00:39:59,984
So we do not want to repeat the same study that already done.

371
00:40:00,134 --> 00:40:04,994
So we want to try something new and then to narrow down a problem.

372
00:40:05,994 --> 00:40:15,924
And then ultimately this literature review, sir, and then write your ideas so your research question and then your background section.

373
00:40:19,214 --> 00:40:22,674
So the literature review review process is first you can.

374
00:40:23,264 --> 00:40:29,264
So as we already see that, so you start with the broad question, the problem formulation,

375
00:40:29,864 --> 00:40:37,124
and then based on the person in the literature review and the evaluate critically evaluate these.

376
00:40:37,484 --> 00:40:41,174
And then based on your evaluation, you can you may also have to go back.

377
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:49,294
So based on this, by the way, it's already done. So that's why I want to create a little bit and then a different direction.

378
00:40:49,534 --> 00:40:56,704
And then based on that direction and the you do another literature review search, find the relevant literature and then evaluate.

379
00:40:57,154 --> 00:41:08,374
So that's why this is a secular one in that you have to repeat this until you finally and then get a clear, very concrete idea of your research.

380
00:41:13,994 --> 00:41:18,553
Okay. So, um. So to do literature review.

381
00:41:18,554 --> 00:41:21,944
So we are using this database.

382
00:41:22,274 --> 00:41:30,224
So many cases, this biomedical research, we are using this pulp method or Google Scholar, web of science.

383
00:41:30,944 --> 00:41:37,544
So have you used one of these literature search engine database?

384
00:41:38,244 --> 00:41:46,363
Okay. Right. Okay. And especially if you saw the University of Michigan, our library provide full text service.

385
00:41:46,364 --> 00:41:49,574
So they are subscribing a lot of genre.

386
00:41:49,874 --> 00:41:57,604
So just not going to the parliament, but access to the pub med through the, um, library.

387
00:41:57,614 --> 00:41:59,684
So then you can access to the full text.

388
00:42:04,034 --> 00:42:13,214
So then the literature search process and they're using this one of the searching database and after you find the relevant literature.

389
00:42:13,934 --> 00:42:22,274
Now how many have used the reference management program either manually zero title and the note.

390
00:42:25,144 --> 00:42:30,124
Okay. About half of them. Okay. So now your masters today,

391
00:42:30,184 --> 00:42:38,134
which means that you are doing your research and then after end of this year and then when you move to the second year, you will.

392
00:42:38,824 --> 00:42:46,024
So the I am, you know, the curriculum committee. So we will we will hold a meet and greet session.

393
00:42:46,264 --> 00:42:53,434
And then when you start, you do know the integrity of the learning experience.

394
00:42:54,184 --> 00:43:03,214
So that is your requirement. And then you identify your research advisor and then you will work with your research advisor.

395
00:43:03,814 --> 00:43:13,174
And then at the time. You know, after you do your literature and then using this the third.

396
00:43:14,644 --> 00:43:21,843
The Reference Management program I strongly recommend because right now I have five mile is two done.

397
00:43:21,844 --> 00:43:26,794
So not done. I'm not able to use this reference image of a problem.

398
00:43:26,794 --> 00:43:32,524
So you know, when, when we have our first meeting, I always said you have to use this.

399
00:43:32,884 --> 00:43:38,764
So this is because, you know, after you write a paper and then in general, you will have,

400
00:43:39,034 --> 00:43:46,744
you know, 20 to maybe up to 50 references, you do not want to type each reference manually.

401
00:43:46,744 --> 00:43:53,404
Right. And sometime maybe, you know, a number of papers is just let's say 20 then manageable.

402
00:43:53,884 --> 00:44:02,494
And they use some of your paper to as one donor and then the editor doesn't like your paper, reject your paper.

403
00:44:02,584 --> 00:44:06,994
You know, that happen all the time. So you don't need to be you know, that this kind of done.

404
00:44:07,294 --> 00:44:13,204
So then you can try another job right and they're all different on their they use different format.

405
00:44:13,864 --> 00:44:17,894
Right. And sometimes you have to reply all of them.

406
00:44:18,214 --> 00:44:25,864
So don't do that using this one and then you can so this program automatically update the different their format.

407
00:44:26,284 --> 00:44:33,773
Hey, it's easy. So if you for those who haven't used this type of reference measurement program,

408
00:44:33,774 --> 00:44:39,504
so then I strongly recommend you go to this and library citation management guide.

409
00:44:40,074 --> 00:44:46,414
Go there and then this mandolins Otero and the note, all of those are available.

410
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:51,324
So depending on which program you are using. So my preference is either mandolins.

411
00:44:51,324 --> 00:44:57,094
Otero And so, and the note is the most popular, but you have.

412
00:44:57,114 --> 00:45:02,663
So the basic version is free, but the advanced version is, is very expensive.

413
00:45:02,664 --> 00:45:08,814
So about $200. But Mandalay is a free program and then it's easy to use.

414
00:45:09,084 --> 00:45:12,594
So go there and then you can download and then you can use this.

415
00:45:14,064 --> 00:45:27,834
So for this class, when you do your group project, you may have to say not many, but probably just five references depending on your answer.

416
00:45:28,524 --> 00:45:34,734
So I strongly recommend it's not a requirement, but if you have to decide a paper,

417
00:45:35,004 --> 00:45:43,764
I strongly recommend you use one on this program to say and then put the reference into your final report.

418
00:45:46,424 --> 00:45:49,784
Okay. So use this citation management program.

419
00:45:49,784 --> 00:45:57,644
So this is one example. So American Journal of Epidemiology, one of the the major or leading epidemiologist genre.

420
00:45:58,274 --> 00:46:08,984
So then you know within the body pact it use this number reference so starting from one to the next reference is two or three and so right

421
00:46:09,434 --> 00:46:19,664
and then you are putting all the reference at the end using the format is so the if you have more than three so should have more than six.

422
00:46:21,624 --> 00:46:36,534
The authors. And then then you only add that this three author and I put this at R and then the blue Kyra and then John, another name, which is Italy.

423
00:46:37,474 --> 00:46:41,524
And then your volume and the page number.

424
00:46:41,644 --> 00:46:45,934
So this is the format. These of the rapid images requirement.

425
00:46:46,324 --> 00:46:55,294
So if you are using different format, so then the donor added are not even send your paper to appear we extend our review

426
00:46:55,444 --> 00:47:02,284
does send it back to you and then you have to reformat your your reference.

427
00:47:02,524 --> 00:47:05,764
So that's why depending on which journal you are submitting.

428
00:47:05,794 --> 00:47:13,384
So you are targeting your study and then you have to use this and add you this number reference.

429
00:47:13,504 --> 00:47:20,124
But otherwise you'll never use author name and the year of the publication within the body impacts.

430
00:47:20,854 --> 00:47:21,964
So then in that case,

431
00:47:22,264 --> 00:47:33,814
the reference at the end is ordered by the apply batting order of first author not the the the order of reference cited in the by the text.

432
00:47:34,984 --> 00:47:38,614
So that's why I strongly recommend you use this citation management program.

433
00:47:42,404 --> 00:47:53,934
Okay. So we review you know, research Kurson background significant section and then now we are moving to this AP research design.

434
00:47:54,804 --> 00:47:57,504
So then those are what you learn from 600.

435
00:47:57,534 --> 00:48:05,784
So depending on whether or not the study is, you know, experimental study, which is a clinical trial or it is a observational study,

436
00:48:05,784 --> 00:48:15,083
we can classify a research design into this two observational study and then experimental study within observational studies,

437
00:48:15,084 --> 00:48:19,464
depending on when exposure or outcome is measure.

438
00:48:19,464 --> 00:48:29,244
So the timing of exposure and outcome. And then we classify into this cross-sectional study, cohort study and case control study.

439
00:48:29,754 --> 00:48:36,504
Okay. So I will now review. So repeat all these you long days from 600.

440
00:48:37,704 --> 00:48:43,524
But let's apply, you know, whether there's fishing to reduce coronary heart disease.

441
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:47,044
These are coronary heart disease theories.

442
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:58,634
And then depending on these different study, these are. So cohort study as you know that so this we recruit people who are free of the disease or be

443
00:48:58,634 --> 00:49:07,304
interested and then we examine their exposure exposure status at baseline and then we follow them.

444
00:49:08,974 --> 00:49:13,924
Prospectively or retrospectively, depending on when you are collecting.

445
00:49:13,954 --> 00:49:18,124
So when you measure this, the record, the paper,

446
00:49:18,484 --> 00:49:24,244
and then if you prospectively follow those paper until they develop what is it is a

447
00:49:24,244 --> 00:49:29,314
prospective design or if we are using information that already collected in the past.

448
00:49:30,064 --> 00:49:39,784
So then that's a retrospective study. So even for so investigator measure a patient at baseline and then periodically examine

449
00:49:39,794 --> 00:49:46,234
subset at follow up visit to see if those who eat more B's have a fewer event.

450
00:49:47,574 --> 00:49:52,434
So cross-sectional study, you measure exposure and outcome at the same time.

451
00:49:52,764 --> 00:49:59,534
Right. So that's why the she interviews some of them about current and past history of

452
00:49:59,544 --> 00:50:05,304
fish intake and correlate research with history and current qualification score.

453
00:50:05,724 --> 00:50:16,994
So when I. So actually I used this sentence in the final exam and then ask, what is the study design of this example?

454
00:50:17,424 --> 00:50:23,964
And then some of you will confuse this is a cross-sectional study or this is a retrospective cohort study.

455
00:50:24,234 --> 00:50:30,144
Okay. And you can tell why this is. This is not a retrospective study.

456
00:50:30,924 --> 00:50:33,924
The description of this in this example.

457
00:50:47,074 --> 00:50:52,954
So I know you raise your hand, but let me give you another student who.

458
00:50:59,364 --> 00:51:11,634
Okay, Vincent. Or whether why this is a question why this is not some description of the asset.

459
00:51:11,754 --> 00:51:27,204
So this description does not reflect the retrospective study which looks at the current and current baseline.

460
00:51:29,384 --> 00:51:38,514
But so no matter when, when you measure like a your exposure or outcome to any type of core study.

461
00:51:38,934 --> 00:51:43,184
So the timing of exposure and the timing of outcome at different rate.

462
00:51:43,914 --> 00:51:49,434
So the retrospective means that you are collecting that information that already collected

463
00:51:49,434 --> 00:51:55,314
so that already either collected at the administrative data or something like that.

464
00:51:55,344 --> 00:52:06,084
Right. And but timing of exposure and the timing of outcome is the exposure happen first and then outcome happen later.

465
00:52:06,354 --> 00:52:11,034
Right. But the cross-sectional study you measure exposed an outcome at the same time.

466
00:52:11,154 --> 00:52:18,163
Right. So that was this description. So you interview a subject and then when you interview themselves.

467
00:52:18,164 --> 00:52:27,174
So you are asking. Whether this person you know have facing tech right now or have you.

468
00:52:28,434 --> 00:52:32,664
Have you had a face in the history of Israel?

469
00:52:32,874 --> 00:52:38,574
But still you are collecting this information right now and at the same time, you are measuring history.

470
00:52:39,294 --> 00:52:42,024
So have you experienced it in the past?

471
00:52:42,184 --> 00:52:49,974
So you are measuring at the same time or so this correlated custom score is that you measure this huge and some of the,

472
00:52:50,274 --> 00:52:55,134
you know, the instrument and then you are measuring this at the same rate.

473
00:52:55,134 --> 00:53:00,533
So that's what this means, explosion, outcome measure at the same time.

474
00:53:00,534 --> 00:53:05,284
So that's why this is a cross-sectional study and not a retrospective course study.

475
00:53:07,344 --> 00:53:10,644
So case control study as you identify it.

476
00:53:10,794 --> 00:53:16,434
So I'll come first. Right. So that's where you are. You recruit cases.

477
00:53:16,974 --> 00:53:20,634
And then based on the case and the where this case came from,

478
00:53:20,964 --> 00:53:28,794
and then you recruit or center your control and then you are comparing these cases and control in terms of their exposure.

479
00:53:29,634 --> 00:53:35,044
Okay. So clinical trials or randomized clinical trials.

480
00:53:35,074 --> 00:53:41,404
So then you are you're providing this fish oil pill and placebo,

481
00:53:41,764 --> 00:53:48,784
and then you follow those your clinical trial participants over the next several

482
00:53:48,784 --> 00:53:55,564
years and then see how this chronic heart disease develops in this population.

483
00:54:00,034 --> 00:54:03,894
Okay. So then the next part is study subject.

484
00:54:04,364 --> 00:54:12,114
So then when you recruit or define your study so that you have to consider this crucial component to decision making points.

485
00:54:12,404 --> 00:54:18,664
First one is you have to specify inclusion and exclusion criteria to define the target population.

486
00:54:18,674 --> 00:54:23,254
So the target population, but they are they are not accessible.

487
00:54:23,294 --> 00:54:31,214
So that's how you define your source population. And then depending on your study design and then who are eligible or who are not

488
00:54:31,214 --> 00:54:36,373
eligible and then using that information and then you recruit your participants.

489
00:54:36,374 --> 00:54:39,614
So that's why you have to specify in your research proposal.

490
00:54:40,034 --> 00:54:46,874
So the inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria so more dependent over the years in the next we.

491
00:54:48,034 --> 00:54:55,504
And then how to record this paper. Okay.

492
00:54:55,654 --> 00:54:58,714
And the next component, is this a variable?

493
00:54:58,834 --> 00:55:02,764
So which variable will be measure and how we measure those variable?

494
00:55:03,034 --> 00:55:10,314
So this class will have covered this. So when you move to 641 this very well.

495
00:55:10,774 --> 00:55:15,574
So how to design your study and instrument will be cover in 641.

496
00:55:18,674 --> 00:55:26,204
And I think this is so. And then final one is when you design, study and then the component in your proposal.

497
00:55:26,384 --> 00:55:34,034
So you are talking about the statistical issue. So statistically, she should be considered even at the design stage.

498
00:55:34,274 --> 00:55:43,004
Right. And then that sort of statistical issue will determine how you collect your value over the how to design your instrument.

499
00:55:43,454 --> 00:55:52,964
Right. Whether or not you want to you want to collect. You want to collect age as a continuous variable or age as a category.

500
00:55:52,994 --> 00:56:00,134
So between so what is your age? And then 10 to 19, 22, 29, 32, 39, something like that.

501
00:56:00,164 --> 00:56:03,374
So you can also collect information as a category.

502
00:56:04,304 --> 00:56:09,794
And then, depending on how this variable is collected, statistical approaches will be different.

503
00:56:11,064 --> 00:56:14,394
And also that also impact the power so they don't even cover that.

504
00:56:14,724 --> 00:56:18,114
So this is why you have to think of a statistical issue.

505
00:56:19,024 --> 00:56:22,034
Even before you collect the data. Hmm.

506
00:56:22,884 --> 00:56:27,864
And also that determine how to calculate your asylum power.

507
00:56:29,384 --> 00:56:33,334
Okay. So right now.

508
00:56:33,464 --> 00:56:38,054
So you have already taken by 21 and the rhino, you are taking 522.

509
00:56:38,174 --> 00:56:42,434
So covering linear regression and logistic regression.

510
00:56:42,464 --> 00:56:42,764
Right.

511
00:56:42,974 --> 00:56:52,364
And then when you move to the second year, when you take 523 and then you really don't know about survival analysis, like a time to event outcome.

512
00:56:55,804 --> 00:57:03,244
Okay. So these are what we know about the anatomy of research, epidemic research.

513
00:57:03,304 --> 00:57:12,364
So let's move to the physiology of research and how this, you know, different component and that they are working together.

514
00:57:13,664 --> 00:57:17,824
So again. So you remember no epidemiologist.

515
00:57:17,854 --> 00:57:24,794
We are not looking at the entire population, so we only look at the sample, but we start from the target population.

516
00:57:25,314 --> 00:57:31,304
Okay. Starting from the target population. But target population is mostly inaccessible.

517
00:57:32,054 --> 00:57:36,974
So that's why we need to identify who are SS or source population.

518
00:57:37,514 --> 00:57:41,894
Okay. And then from those source populations,

519
00:57:41,894 --> 00:57:49,244
so who are eligible for not only the inclusion and exclusion criteria and then you define this eligible sample.

520
00:57:50,084 --> 00:57:54,284
So these all happened, this design stage.

521
00:57:55,514 --> 00:58:01,724
Okay. And then after you identify this person per and that you are implementing, you are study.

522
00:58:03,344 --> 00:58:07,364
So that's why you actually recruit your study participant.

523
00:58:08,874 --> 00:58:14,154
And that your research question is also these are the designing and implementing

524
00:58:14,784 --> 00:58:17,904
and the your research questions start from the your target population.

525
00:58:17,914 --> 00:58:21,384
So the research question, which is true in the universe.

526
00:58:21,864 --> 00:58:26,374
Okay. But then that is also true in the study.

527
00:58:26,394 --> 00:58:31,524
Your study plan in the study. And then your finding in the study.

528
00:58:32,504 --> 00:58:36,704
And then using this finding in your study, you go back.

529
00:58:37,794 --> 00:58:46,764
To your target population. Hey. And then drawing of is what you see from the center is sort of true in the part of.

530
00:58:47,674 --> 00:58:52,354
Okay. So this is why this is all the inference system.

531
00:58:54,534 --> 00:59:04,454
Infer and infer. And then from this stage and that you have to consider whether or not your study semper.

532
00:59:05,684 --> 00:59:17,054
Representative of your eligible members. So they are similar in terms of exposure, distribution, outcome distribution or other variable distribution.

533
00:59:17,504 --> 00:59:28,154
And whether or not what you intend to measure is actually correctly measure in your sampler or even though your intention was to,

534
00:59:28,454 --> 00:59:38,384
you know, the correct answer, but the your participant for some reason didn't give you the the answer that you want to collect.

535
00:59:38,564 --> 00:59:46,534
Right. So that's why they can. They can cause this, madam, an error or information bias.

536
00:59:47,964 --> 00:59:55,044
So selection bias, information, bias or confounding, all of them can impact this internal validity.

537
00:59:55,404 --> 01:00:05,224
Right. And then if Al is over, semper not the same as your source population or target population.

538
01:00:05,494 --> 01:00:08,864
And then that can also impact your external validity.

539
01:00:08,884 --> 01:00:15,814
So whether or not finding from your ineligible center can be generalizable to your target population.

540
01:00:17,344 --> 01:00:22,344
So these are whole like a feature or how AP research is working.

541
01:00:22,874 --> 01:00:30,413
Hey. So eventually you will be looking at only the studied participant actress sample.

542
01:00:30,414 --> 01:00:34,074
And then what you will see is this finding in the study.

543
01:00:35,394 --> 01:00:43,164
And even though you do not see what's happening in this upper area, but through this important step.

544
01:00:43,824 --> 01:00:49,314
And then you are. You are generalizing, you'll finding whether or not this is.

545
01:00:51,654 --> 01:00:56,844
This happened in the Elizabeth Center. This is also happening in the source or target population.

546
01:00:57,734 --> 01:01:00,794
So this is how AP study is doing.

547
01:01:03,994 --> 01:01:06,954
Okay. So let's look at this one by one.

548
01:01:06,964 --> 01:01:13,324
So designing the study and the let's say this your research question is what is the prevalence of regular use of fish oil

549
01:01:13,324 --> 01:01:23,854
supplement among people with a C H did so then this is your research culture and then your target population is people with a CHB.

550
01:01:25,084 --> 01:01:32,104
And then what you want to measure is the proportion who take fish oil supplement.

551
01:01:33,054 --> 01:01:36,444
Okay. But just people with ADHD is too broad.

552
01:01:37,534 --> 01:01:42,004
So that's why you have to define your your Elizabeth Center.

553
01:01:42,514 --> 01:01:48,784
So typically, Elizabeth Sanford defined in terms of this location and time.

554
01:01:49,744 --> 01:01:56,734
Okay. So location and time are important component of the inclusion and exclusion criteria.

555
01:01:57,124 --> 01:02:07,174
So that's why the intent of the center or is or patient with the history of the scene in a clear clinic in, let's say a clinic in another.

556
01:02:09,134 --> 01:02:13,244
And what a win last year. Okay.

557
01:02:13,784 --> 01:02:20,884
And then you intended the very over even though the your true information you intend to major is the proposition.

558
01:02:20,894 --> 01:02:28,783
But how we can measure this proportion of you know visually supplement you use your questionnaire and

559
01:02:28,784 --> 01:02:34,844
that your participant fill those questionnaire so that you a self report use of fish or supplement.

560
01:02:36,854 --> 01:02:43,154
So that's why sometime this intended sample and the intended the variable do not represent

561
01:02:43,184 --> 01:02:48,914
what's happening in your target population or actual phenomenon will be interest.

562
01:02:49,154 --> 01:02:59,264
So therefore, if the intended stamper and variable do not represent a target population and the phenomena of interest and then this add will happen.

563
01:03:00,154 --> 01:03:08,554
And then this at our record is, is extend our validity issue or generalizability issue.

564
01:03:09,484 --> 01:03:15,154
Hmm. So then.

565
01:03:15,454 --> 01:03:22,414
So that's why the design stage you will what you will need to think about and then consider is whether or not you intend to disempower.

566
01:03:22,804 --> 01:03:30,874
And then your target center in terms of your research coercion, they are comparable and then you are intended to represent to your target population.

567
01:03:31,234 --> 01:03:36,874
And that's why whether or not your study is subject to any of this generalizability issue,

568
01:03:37,864 --> 01:03:41,704
but when you actually implement your study, you have another issue.

569
01:03:42,484 --> 01:03:50,494
Okay? So for example, even though you intended a sample so to 15 patients with a history of C h,

570
01:03:50,584 --> 01:03:59,194
the scene in clinic last year were actually you identify this to 15 and then you know provide them

571
01:03:59,194 --> 01:04:08,134
your consent form but not all people were consent and you ended up having only one or four patients.

572
01:04:08,434 --> 01:04:13,654
Right. And for some reason, when you recruit those people, you have a poster.

573
01:04:14,584 --> 01:04:18,484
Fish oil or fish intake is good for your heart.

574
01:04:18,784 --> 01:04:22,464
Good for your heart. Something like.

575
01:04:22,564 --> 01:04:30,694
So then. So who are more likely to say yes to participate in this study, or who are less likely to participate in the study?

576
01:04:31,264 --> 01:04:38,494
So if that happened, so then this one or both may not represent they they are different from this to get in.

577
01:04:38,894 --> 01:04:43,444
Right. If that happened, then even though what you see from your sempre,

578
01:04:43,864 --> 01:04:51,184
that information is not true in your Elizabeth paper and eventually it is also different from your target population.

579
01:04:51,364 --> 01:04:59,064
Right. Why is this bias? What bias?

580
01:05:02,484 --> 01:05:11,124
Selection bias. Okay. And also the intended the variable is self-reported use of insurance supplement.

581
01:05:11,904 --> 01:05:20,364
But, you know, for some reason, for those who, you know, agreed to participate, so wonderful patient and then even though they have never.

582
01:05:20,544 --> 01:05:32,304
Hey Fisher you because you know the your interviewer was very excited and then ask about your fish or your you know, intake history and.

583
01:05:33,564 --> 01:05:36,684
That's why you lie. Right. And the participant can lie.

584
01:05:36,774 --> 01:05:39,924
Right. And that. That information is not true. If that happened.

585
01:05:40,404 --> 01:05:48,474
What is that bias? On fire the response response by more generally.

586
01:05:49,484 --> 01:05:52,754
Is it called self-reporting by self-report bias?

587
01:05:53,054 --> 01:05:57,463
More generally. And those are all the same information.

588
01:05:57,464 --> 01:06:06,044
But we typically say, right. So the response via self-report, bias or under this information bias.

589
01:06:06,084 --> 01:06:09,134
Right. So that's a misclassification happen.

590
01:06:09,554 --> 01:06:16,884
And then when that missed classification happened and what you see from your Sempre is not true in your Elizabeth Center.

591
01:06:16,934 --> 01:06:21,314
Right. So that's why that distortion creates bias.

592
01:06:21,464 --> 01:06:24,514
And then we this is internally valid opinion. Right.

593
01:06:25,694 --> 01:06:31,244
So that's our internal value. That is so the most important piece of this AP.

594
01:06:31,354 --> 01:06:37,574
AP The image of value, the tissue. What you learn from 600 is mostly this about this front that.

595
01:06:38,144 --> 01:06:47,683
So we have to, you know, design good study and then when you implement that study, you have to make sure your study does not have a selection.

596
01:06:47,684 --> 01:06:55,574
Bias is information bias. And also you want to collect information as much as possible and then using that information.

597
01:06:55,994 --> 01:07:04,184
And then you try to avoid any masking between exposure and outcome association by adjusting for confounding.

598
01:07:04,754 --> 01:07:08,744
Okay. So those are important a component of this in current value of the peer.

599
01:07:12,334 --> 01:07:22,414
Okay. And then the matter is over resorts and maybe this slide, one single slide is the key slide of this class, right?

600
01:07:23,714 --> 01:07:27,494
And the random error and systematic error. Have you heard about this?

601
01:07:27,494 --> 01:07:31,604
Random error. Systematic error. Right. Okay. So random error.

602
01:07:32,114 --> 01:07:40,144
Roll reads urge you to tens. And the systematic error is the wrong reason due to bias.

603
01:07:40,474 --> 01:07:44,134
And then just before this slide, we talk about this bias,

604
01:07:44,584 --> 01:07:54,064
which means that if selection bias happened or information bias happen, and then this bias leads to what error?

605
01:07:55,354 --> 01:07:59,134
Systematic manner. Then when this random error happened.

606
01:08:03,984 --> 01:08:09,774
Can we avoid this random error? What does it mean?

607
01:08:10,164 --> 01:08:20,744
So this random error. What is. What is it? What do you base? Go back to the first slide.

608
01:08:20,754 --> 01:08:25,184
We look at the population center, right.

609
01:08:26,024 --> 01:08:29,474
How can you ensure your sample represent your target population?

610
01:08:29,544 --> 01:08:35,284
Right. 1 million your target population.

611
01:08:35,314 --> 01:08:39,734
You look at only 1000. How can you ensure you have 1000?

612
01:08:39,734 --> 01:08:44,434
All your semper is true for your 1 million over your target population.

613
01:08:44,524 --> 01:08:54,454
Right. So that's why you have you're going to have to each of you have a your sample of 1000 sample 1000 sample, 1000 sample, 1000 sample.

614
01:08:55,504 --> 01:09:04,744
So your assumption is that because I ran misled this 1000 out of 1 million, each of you should have the same information, same reserve.

615
01:09:05,874 --> 01:09:09,334
Does that happen? No.

616
01:09:09,744 --> 01:09:17,254
Right. Let's say the prevalence of CHP from your center and the U.S. and the U.S. look at that.

617
01:09:18,174 --> 01:09:23,144
You know, if she has, let's say, 7% and then another sample to have 5%.

618
01:09:23,164 --> 01:09:31,294
Another sample has 8%. Right. And when you look at that, your center, the vet, you will see a variation of those.

619
01:09:31,314 --> 01:09:36,354
Pablo, why that happened? Do you know the true answer?

620
01:09:37,164 --> 01:09:40,584
No. You didn't know because you didn't look at the entire population.

621
01:09:40,974 --> 01:09:50,964
You do not know. Right. But you only rely on your center and assume that what I see from the center is true in your in the target population.

622
01:09:51,534 --> 01:09:56,664
But when you do your center difference center, you will see a variation.

623
01:09:57,354 --> 01:10:01,434
This is the source of random. Okay.

624
01:10:02,154 --> 01:10:06,144
So this is like, what is the simplest way to reduce random error?

625
01:10:10,714 --> 01:10:14,824
Increase your sample size. Right. So that's why you for your sample is smaller.

626
01:10:15,634 --> 01:10:19,024
You're more likely to have is random.

627
01:10:19,414 --> 01:10:24,334
Right. If your sample through art, then your sample.

628
01:10:24,784 --> 01:10:28,234
Less likely to have a this random error.

629
01:10:28,594 --> 01:10:31,654
And that your sample can represent.

630
01:10:31,984 --> 01:10:38,104
And then what you'll see from your center likely to reflect what is happening in the type of population.

631
01:10:40,744 --> 01:10:43,834
Okay. So that's why there is random error, system error.

632
01:10:43,864 --> 01:10:47,244
You see the difference between these random errors. It's not error. Okay.

633
01:10:51,714 --> 01:10:55,464
So then so across and procedure.

634
01:10:55,464 --> 01:11:00,294
And then you learned this from the the 600.

635
01:11:00,444 --> 01:11:07,844
So the. You know, this random error, even though you increased your sympathy.

636
01:11:09,154 --> 01:11:12,154
And then it impact more likely the procedure.

637
01:11:12,244 --> 01:11:22,904
Right. So when you when your sample size is lowered, then obviously the it is more likely to guess precisely measure your your answer.

638
01:11:22,924 --> 01:11:28,894
But when you have this systematic error and it impact the accuracy value that we are finding.

639
01:11:29,254 --> 01:11:31,684
So that's why if you already have a bias,

640
01:11:32,074 --> 01:11:43,094
then even though you have a very good instrument you like when you have a selection bias and then your your arrow does not hit the bull's eye.

641
01:11:43,384 --> 01:11:48,564
And that's why it impact the accuracy. Okay.

642
01:11:48,864 --> 01:11:53,694
So that's why the in summary. So two major take home message.

643
01:11:54,054 --> 01:11:59,154
The Anatomy of research. So then we go over the research question.

644
01:11:59,154 --> 01:12:02,604
So what are the components of the epidemic in research?

645
01:12:02,844 --> 01:12:05,364
So you have to have this research question, background,

646
01:12:05,364 --> 01:12:12,644
significant study design studies over time and the measurement approach and the how AP study is working.

647
01:12:12,654 --> 01:12:18,894
So physiological research, you start from the target population, but we are now looking at the target population.

648
01:12:19,134 --> 01:12:25,104
We only look at the small subset of the target population, which is a sample, right?

649
01:12:25,914 --> 01:12:31,044
And then depending on the size of your center, you have a different chance.

650
01:12:31,464 --> 01:12:37,134
But there is no way to avoid this random error unless you look at the entire population.

651
01:12:38,634 --> 01:12:52,464
Okay. All right. Let's take a five minute break short and then when we come back and then we will move to the next section and then we will resume.

652
01:12:53,664 --> 01:12:58,018
Okay. So 1120. Okay. But there are other reasons why you you just buy less, you know, or even if you're not really for another time, right?

653
01:13:02,112 --> 01:13:05,652
Okay, let's begin again.

654
01:13:07,422 --> 01:13:11,292
So now we have our GSI data.

655
01:13:11,292 --> 01:13:22,332
So this a way to introduce say this. I mean, I'm a third year, you know, I guess I this last year sounds good to them.

656
01:13:24,072 --> 01:13:38,471
Very briefly, I study for taking on both microbiomes and so on and I oh in the ninth office are

657
01:13:38,472 --> 01:13:43,212
did originally virtual this year writing 10 to 12 and it's everything's on campus.

658
01:13:45,912 --> 01:13:54,192
Yeah. Okay. All right. So then the second piece of today's lecture here is about you may not.

659
01:13:54,792 --> 01:14:01,872
So this this is not very like that the the idea or, you know, the way we are.

660
01:14:03,402 --> 01:14:07,812
Explaining the study design and then there's the sampling.

661
01:14:08,382 --> 01:14:14,711
But I decide to put this into here because I think this is a very useful to understand, you know,

662
01:14:14,712 --> 01:14:23,922
depending on different study design and the how, you know, this sampling impact, the validity of the finding in terms of this random matter.

663
01:14:24,112 --> 01:14:28,092
Okay. So that's why I want to give you some information here.

664
01:14:29,132 --> 01:14:38,692
Okay. So then, you know, from your 600, mostly you learn about study design in terms of this level of investigative control.

665
01:14:38,702 --> 01:14:43,051
So that's an observational study or clinical trial or temporality.

666
01:14:43,052 --> 01:14:51,482
So when exposure measure or when outcome is measure, but let's think about this different study design based on the sampling fraction.

667
01:14:53,752 --> 01:14:57,542
So let's say this is the true population, which means a target population.

668
01:14:57,562 --> 01:15:06,592
So target population is our true population. And then let's say this is kind of the cohort study design.

669
01:15:06,862 --> 01:15:13,391
So that's why. If you are able to evaluate the target population.

670
01:15:13,392 --> 01:15:19,322
So entire population. Right. So then there are two like a group.

671
01:15:19,502 --> 01:15:23,552
Just simplify the exposure group and the unexposed group.

672
01:15:24,552 --> 01:15:28,692
And the overtime you count as a pool develop.

673
01:15:29,322 --> 01:15:37,301
And if you do not develop disease so that to a lesser disease within exposed group a non disease

674
01:15:37,302 --> 01:15:46,962
within exposure group B disease within unexposed group C non disease within unexposed will be okay.

675
01:15:47,772 --> 01:15:52,692
So that's a generally we are not able to evaluate the entire population.

676
01:15:53,022 --> 01:16:07,032
So that's why in general we do not know what is A, B, C and D, but let's say this is A through population, then obviously it is known A, B, C, D is.

677
01:16:07,042 --> 01:16:17,512
No, it's already determined, right? But because you are not able to look at the entire population, so you are not able to look at the true population.

678
01:16:19,532 --> 01:16:23,342
You do not know exactly what is c d? But maybe.

679
01:16:23,982 --> 01:16:29,202
Right. So that's why this is a true value or face the value knowing.

680
01:16:29,202 --> 01:16:33,232
Exactly. But you cannot actually get this number.

681
01:16:38,432 --> 01:16:47,672
Using this information anyway. So, you know, when you start your AP 600 or whatever app one on one and then we are making this two by two paper.

682
01:16:47,982 --> 01:16:59,311
So expose and alone expose it is non disease and they using this information you can calculate is odds or risk or

683
01:16:59,312 --> 01:17:07,682
exposure ratio and then that input using this information we calculate risk ratio or relative risk or odds ratio.

684
01:17:08,962 --> 01:17:15,702
So I will not, you know. So explain all this one by one, assuming that you already know all this.

685
01:17:17,052 --> 01:17:28,602
Okay, then let's put some number. Let's say your target population size is 4 million and the 1 million exports and a 3 million non export.

686
01:17:29,322 --> 01:17:34,332
And then let's after five year and then you can't develop these here.

687
01:17:34,632 --> 01:17:43,332
So that's a within exposed grow 50,000 develop the disease within non exposed group also 50,000 develop.

688
01:17:44,182 --> 01:17:49,592
So that's why we can make all this to White Paper. And then using this information, we can calculate odds.

689
01:17:50,452 --> 01:17:56,862
We can also calculate risk or probability. And then we can calculate this risk ratio.

690
01:17:57,402 --> 01:18:03,492
So point five divided by pulling all one seven.

691
01:18:06,832 --> 01:18:11,862
So using this information. Right.

692
01:18:12,252 --> 01:18:23,472
And then this is three. And that point all, by the way divided by .017 is.

693
01:18:25,062 --> 01:18:31,302
Is outrage, right? So that's why from this study, we can say there.

694
01:18:32,412 --> 01:18:42,012
If you are exposed and that you are likely to develop disease three times more than the person who are not exposed to this exposure.

695
01:18:45,682 --> 01:18:50,122
And even odds ratio is close to the risk ratio.

696
01:18:50,122 --> 01:18:57,202
And this is because you know the to the this is very slower overall.

697
01:18:57,382 --> 01:19:03,952
So that's why the odds ratio in this case for rarity, there is a good approximation of risk ratio.

698
01:19:05,182 --> 01:19:14,722
Hey. Sampling friction is.

699
01:19:16,442 --> 01:19:19,532
It is known and the fear.

700
01:19:20,192 --> 01:19:24,662
But this is. These are. Um.

701
01:19:28,972 --> 01:19:32,752
We cannot measure this on observable.

702
01:19:35,242 --> 01:19:38,402
We have no money to evaluate the entire population. Right.

703
01:19:38,952 --> 01:19:57,272
So. So this is why what we are actually realizing is this small A, small B, small C and a small D So it is a, smaller, a, B, C, D is determined.

704
01:19:58,382 --> 01:20:10,742
In a study. Let's say you you recruit 3000 people or 1000 people a year, and then you ask using some instrument.

705
01:20:11,082 --> 01:20:20,452
So if you if they are exposed to that sort of this exposure or if you develop the disease and using that information, you.

706
01:20:21,632 --> 01:20:38,012
You measured this, right? So the sampling fraction is the ratio between this observed in the study of a number observed in a study and then number.

707
01:20:39,002 --> 01:20:45,632
Which is unobserved in the target population for this ratio.

708
01:20:46,202 --> 01:20:53,321
We call this a sampling fraction. The problem with you, I'm sure.

709
01:20:53,322 --> 01:20:57,202
Any problem? Yeah. I like how people go there.

710
01:20:57,512 --> 01:21:05,362
You're right. Okay.

711
01:21:05,782 --> 01:21:12,772
So then let's think about the cross-sectional study. So the cross-sectional study when we measure exposure and outcome.

712
01:21:15,562 --> 01:21:19,042
At the same time, right? We matter. Explore. Then I'll come.

713
01:21:19,042 --> 01:21:23,151
Same time. So then when we murder explore. Then I'll come to Reno.

714
01:21:23,152 --> 01:21:26,182
Explore the status and outcome. Status of the participant.

715
01:21:29,292 --> 01:21:34,022
We do not know because we didn't measure yet, right? We do not know their exposure status.

716
01:21:34,032 --> 01:21:37,842
We do not know their outcome status. It is a cross-sectional study.

717
01:21:38,442 --> 01:21:46,572
Right. So that's why this exposure status outcome status is independent of your sampling.

718
01:21:46,632 --> 01:21:52,362
Right. Because you do not know their exposure status. Outcome status if your selection is random.

719
01:21:53,532 --> 01:21:59,472
So maybe I have to say first. If your selection simply was done random.

720
01:21:59,772 --> 01:22:03,822
Right. So assuming that your selection was done randomly.

721
01:22:04,572 --> 01:22:08,892
So then the index for the status and outcome status. Totally independent.

722
01:22:10,232 --> 01:22:13,712
Okay. So this is why.

723
01:22:14,552 --> 01:22:15,122
And then let's.

724
01:22:15,302 --> 01:22:22,982
And then after you measure this and that, you are saying here and they're making this two by two table, and then you are realizing that.

725
01:22:23,282 --> 01:22:30,872
Okay. And the 50% expose and then have a these and the nine under 50 exposed but no

726
01:22:31,142 --> 01:22:39,682
is 59 exposed and then these years and then 2959 equals and then no digit.

727
01:22:40,852 --> 01:22:48,832
So that's why generally and ideally because this explosion outcome measure totally independently.

728
01:22:49,252 --> 01:22:54,462
So that's why we can expect a sampling fraction. All the same.

729
01:22:55,922 --> 01:22:58,202
In this or percent. Right.

730
01:22:58,682 --> 01:23:10,022
And that is randomly selected so that for each the distribution of these for cell independent and then it's a proportional proportional.

731
01:23:10,052 --> 01:23:15,212
In this case, 0.1 percent, you select point 1%.

732
01:23:16,572 --> 01:23:19,872
And now using this information if we are calculating.

733
01:23:21,682 --> 01:23:28,022
Risk ratio. And then you really get this three risk ratio.

734
01:23:28,022 --> 01:23:32,112
The three will address a 3.1. And then these.

735
01:23:33,892 --> 01:23:36,892
Reflecting what what is truly in the target population.

736
01:23:37,042 --> 01:23:43,082
Right. But again, this is either a situation or.

737
01:23:45,462 --> 01:23:51,122
But reality is. That either situation doesn't happen.

738
01:23:51,392 --> 01:23:55,652
Right. We always have some leverage over this, Adam.

739
01:23:57,642 --> 01:24:05,322
And then because this is a cross-sectional study and all pollsters are independent, this area or so are all independent.

740
01:24:07,082 --> 01:24:08,402
That's all different.

741
01:24:10,102 --> 01:24:27,082
And then so that's why this number could be, let's say, 47 and then this could be five, 950, let's say 53, and then this is a 52 and then 2900.

742
01:24:28,102 --> 01:24:37,222
Or a boys ever. Right. So you have some different, you know, distribution, which is different from what's happening, the target population.

743
01:24:37,372 --> 01:24:43,192
Right. And then that's why using this information, what you observe in your study.

744
01:24:44,082 --> 01:24:49,802
So then you will not get. Risk ratio equal to 3.0.

745
01:24:50,672 --> 01:25:02,012
What you will actually see from your sample is different from 3.0, which means that your center is likely to lead to some better.

746
01:25:03,072 --> 01:25:06,362
What is the better? Is it systematic error?

747
01:25:09,452 --> 01:25:17,032
Or is it random? Did I say anything about how.

748
01:25:18,422 --> 01:25:26,522
These people were recruited or sort of when participant you know participate in this study and then they.

749
01:25:27,392 --> 01:25:33,152
So their participation rate depends on their exposure status or outcome status.

750
01:25:33,722 --> 01:25:38,642
No. So that's why we are now assuming that there is no selection bias.

751
01:25:39,962 --> 01:25:43,982
No madam in there. No confounding. So there is no.

752
01:25:45,192 --> 01:25:46,812
It turns out that is a key issue.

753
01:25:47,772 --> 01:25:56,862
Even there, because of this random error, your sample does not keep you through as what's happening in the target population.

754
01:25:57,302 --> 01:26:03,872
Okay. So this is unavoidable, unfortunately, all the time.

755
01:26:03,902 --> 01:26:11,602
Right. Do you understand this?

756
01:26:11,612 --> 01:26:17,852
Right. How this random error happened and how this random error impact the validity of your study.

757
01:26:18,782 --> 01:26:21,862
Okay. All right.

758
01:26:22,782 --> 01:26:31,692
Clinical trial or core study, which means that you have people who do not have the disease of your interest.

759
01:26:31,872 --> 01:26:38,952
Right. And then you measure the exposure and exposure at baseline, and then you follow them.

760
01:26:41,762 --> 01:26:45,672
And then you are counting. So who developed kids who do not develop that do.

761
01:26:45,992 --> 01:26:49,712
So this is why at the time of selection.

762
01:26:50,792 --> 01:26:55,021
You do not know their de Jesus status. Right. So that's what it is.

763
01:26:55,022 --> 01:26:59,152
Status does not impair your sympathy. Hey.

764
01:27:00,692 --> 01:27:08,072
The only information that can impact your your sampling is this exposure status.

765
01:27:08,402 --> 01:27:13,022
Right. But generally, course study even you do not know the exposure status.

766
01:27:13,592 --> 01:27:21,132
That's why cohort study. This f a b is the same as f, c, d.

767
01:27:21,192 --> 01:27:30,862
So this is. Generally the same because even you do not know the exploiter status and that you are measuring exposure at baseline.

768
01:27:32,572 --> 01:27:39,112
So that's why the core study at the beginning star is a cross-sectional study and

769
01:27:39,112 --> 01:27:45,351
that you identify the outcome status and then you identify the exposure status and

770
01:27:45,352 --> 01:27:50,542
then after you are excluding those who already have a prevalent disease and the

771
01:27:50,542 --> 01:27:55,012
only those who do not have the disease over your interest that you follow them.

772
01:27:55,842 --> 01:28:00,152
Over time. So that's a gender how study is doing, right?

773
01:28:00,492 --> 01:28:07,032
You design of cross-sectional study, very large course study first and then only use only following.

774
01:28:07,212 --> 01:28:17,062
Those who do not have this is overcome, right? But clinical trial error, you can you can control the ratio of this exposure and not exposed.

775
01:28:17,272 --> 01:28:21,742
So this is why this F, ab and f, c d could be different.

776
01:28:22,782 --> 01:28:28,721
Okay. But you have to make sure because this sampling so the disease status doesn't

777
01:28:28,722 --> 01:28:32,812
not impact is sampling and that is simply does not impact the disease status.

778
01:28:32,962 --> 01:28:38,072
So that's why within exposure group you expect it's A, B and F.

779
01:28:38,572 --> 01:28:42,532
So within the disease group and the non disease group is the same.

780
01:28:43,972 --> 01:28:44,302
Okay.

781
01:28:45,022 --> 01:28:53,992
And then within the non exposure group, the sampling fraction in the digits group and the sampling fraction in the non business group is the same.

782
01:28:55,922 --> 01:29:04,652
On the other hand, sampling friction is fixed within expose and within not exposed.

783
01:29:05,692 --> 01:29:11,162
Okay. So I will be asking this in the final exam.

784
01:29:11,912 --> 01:29:15,182
Okay. Okay.

785
01:29:19,342 --> 01:29:26,032
And okay, so that's why we appeal. So if we conduct this actual clinical trial course study.

786
01:29:27,132 --> 01:29:31,182
Because we are not evaluating the entire what's a formula, right?

787
01:29:31,662 --> 01:29:35,382
So that's what we are looking at, let's say 2000.

788
01:29:38,252 --> 01:29:43,372
You know, expose a group and then 3000. No unexposed group.

789
01:29:44,322 --> 01:29:49,302
So that's a known exposure group. There are simply a fraction is out of 3 million.

790
01:29:50,932 --> 01:29:55,512
So that's why this is a 2.1% exposure.

791
01:29:55,852 --> 01:30:01,192
This is out of 1 million. So that's why this is a point a point 2%.

792
01:30:01,642 --> 01:30:06,682
Right. So that's why we see the sampling fraction between exposure and the non exposures.

793
01:30:07,132 --> 01:30:10,592
So within exposure and non-explosive all have the same.

794
01:30:11,092 --> 01:30:14,012
But this is different. Okay.

795
01:30:15,742 --> 01:30:24,982
But using this information, if we are calculating risk ratio, which is three, this is the same as what it is in the target population.

796
01:30:27,002 --> 01:30:32,912
Okay. So eventually, even though we see different sampling fraction.

797
01:30:34,142 --> 01:30:40,232
Adds Roemer, the sampling fraction is independent of the digital status.

798
01:30:41,042 --> 01:30:46,322
It does not lead to bias. So that's like, do you remember?

799
01:30:47,532 --> 01:30:54,612
When selection bias happened 600 or say that when selection bias happened.

800
01:30:56,172 --> 01:31:01,722
If selection. Is related to exposure.

801
01:31:04,632 --> 01:31:11,862
Outcome. If your selection or sampling.

802
01:31:13,132 --> 01:31:16,462
It's related to both expose and outcome.

803
01:31:18,162 --> 01:31:24,672
Okay. If selection is relayed to only one, I can only exposure.

804
01:31:25,272 --> 01:31:30,582
But if it is independent of the digital state, it doesn't lead to selection bias.

805
01:31:31,352 --> 01:31:39,792
Okay, so this is an example. So even though we see different selection sampling fraction between exposed and the non non-experts,

806
01:31:40,722 --> 01:31:46,662
as long as sampling fraction is the same in terms of this digital state.

807
01:31:46,782 --> 01:31:51,912
So which means the sampling fraction is independent of digital status.

808
01:31:52,152 --> 01:31:56,922
It does not related to selection bias. Okay.

809
01:31:59,712 --> 01:32:06,102
As we see here. Okay. But again.

810
01:32:07,522 --> 01:32:13,442
We always have. So tell us about all this matter.

811
01:32:13,972 --> 01:32:22,312
So that's why we are not able to get the true, you know, the effect estimate unless we look at the entire population.

812
01:32:22,702 --> 01:32:26,752
But. What is the source of this bias error?

813
01:32:26,782 --> 01:32:35,212
So let me say this, Aaron. So to to to to be differential to differentiate between this error and bias.

814
01:32:35,572 --> 01:32:51,242
So then what is the source of error? This is the.

815
01:32:54,222 --> 01:32:57,412
Yeah. For a variation.

816
01:33:02,032 --> 01:33:06,962
Okay. All right.

817
01:33:07,062 --> 01:33:13,882
Finally, his control study. Then how we select and how we conduct case control study.

818
01:33:14,562 --> 01:33:21,672
We so typically we do this case control study when the diseases are rare.

819
01:33:22,182 --> 01:33:26,192
Right. So very rarely happen.

820
01:33:26,232 --> 01:33:29,862
So that's why we almost simpler cases.

821
01:33:30,842 --> 01:33:34,502
Okay so the target population where this case happened.

822
01:33:34,892 --> 01:33:43,622
Record typically this is a catch someone area. So within that catchment area and the let's say a very rare disease you know certain cancer.

823
01:33:44,682 --> 01:33:49,332
So we try to recall all the cancer cases from the PetSmart area.

824
01:33:50,312 --> 01:33:58,832
So that's why if you just do the random selection, then you are not you are not including the entire cases.

825
01:33:59,522 --> 01:34:05,671
But case control design is doesn't do random selection of the case case control

826
01:34:05,672 --> 01:34:12,392
study try to recruit case as a manage it possibly because it is a real design,

827
01:34:12,692 --> 01:34:21,002
but you want to have a enough number of cases. That's why in case control study cases oversimplify.

828
01:34:22,082 --> 01:34:26,072
Compared to the selection probability of the control.

829
01:34:28,512 --> 01:34:36,362
Okay. So that's why. So let's do a sampling fracture over the years.

830
01:34:38,012 --> 01:34:45,272
The cases, it's much larger than selection probability or sampling fraction of the control.

831
01:34:46,482 --> 01:34:53,162
Okay. Which means that so a simple infraction is fixed.

832
01:34:54,122 --> 01:34:57,992
Within this year and within not this year.

833
01:34:58,562 --> 01:35:04,052
Because when you recruit to, you know, the exposure status of cases.

834
01:35:05,532 --> 01:35:10,062
You know, explore the status of your controller. You do not know if you know.

835
01:35:10,482 --> 01:35:13,562
So let the. Caused by, right?

836
01:35:15,212 --> 01:35:20,192
So that's why when you conduct your case control study, you have to be mindful.

837
01:35:20,582 --> 01:35:28,452
So then the selection is only based on cases status, whether or not this person has the disease of interest.

838
01:35:28,802 --> 01:35:34,252
And then you are selecting control. Without knowing their exposure status.

839
01:35:34,522 --> 01:35:39,711
I. So that's why this sampling fracture within.

840
01:35:39,712 --> 01:35:42,922
This is within and it is the same.

841
01:35:44,062 --> 01:35:47,332
But any case control study generally.

842
01:35:48,992 --> 01:35:55,362
This sampling infection is different. And this is because we oversample here.

843
01:35:58,772 --> 01:36:04,252
And then and then much, much less infection control.

844
01:36:04,592 --> 01:36:08,312
Right. Makes sense. Right. Okay.

845
01:36:09,652 --> 01:36:15,192
So this is why. Let's say you have a. 1000.

846
01:36:16,192 --> 01:36:19,942
Cases and then 2004.

847
01:36:21,312 --> 01:36:27,712
In your study. So you identify 1000 cases and then using that information and using the match

848
01:36:27,922 --> 01:36:34,392
matching and then you you match who control per case and then you design this way,

849
01:36:34,412 --> 01:36:43,592
right? And then. After you assess their exposure status and let's say you have 500 exposures and

850
01:36:43,592 --> 01:36:51,862
the 500 non exposed and then within control 494 exposure into 1534 non exposed.

851
01:36:53,762 --> 01:37:03,332
So that's all we can expect. Generally sampling fraction within this is the same and then sampling friction within non-digital to the same.

852
01:37:03,932 --> 01:37:08,792
But their sampling friction is quite different and that this is much, much, much larger.

853
01:37:09,872 --> 01:37:14,882
Okay. And then what is the Optima?

854
01:37:15,092 --> 01:37:18,482
The best, in fact, estimate in the case control study?

855
01:37:19,762 --> 01:37:25,282
Odds ratio is a good approximation of true risk ratio not.

856
01:37:26,222 --> 01:37:34,412
Risk rating from the center. Okay. So that's why we are using these and they you calculate risk ratio and then that is 2.4,

857
01:37:34,412 --> 01:37:40,142
which is quite different from the the true risk ratio in the target population.

858
01:37:40,442 --> 01:37:48,602
But odds ratio is a good approximation. And this is why odds ratio is a unbiased estimate in case control study.

859
01:37:48,872 --> 01:37:56,972
Right? And you should not calculate risk ratio. So that's why in case control study we we do not say risk like.

860
01:37:58,332 --> 01:38:13,352
Did not say. But unfortunately, you know, through study like always this pattern and this is why.

861
01:38:14,492 --> 01:38:18,692
Even the sampling friction within the disease could be different.

862
01:38:18,712 --> 01:38:23,282
This could be different. Right? And then that related to the bias.

863
01:38:24,662 --> 01:38:27,692
Again. What is the source of this error?

864
01:38:30,442 --> 01:38:33,952
Random. And. Hey.

865
01:38:35,182 --> 01:38:43,262
All right. So actually I want to have a piece one and then.

866
01:38:44,672 --> 01:38:47,762
Okay. So maybe let's let's.

867
01:38:47,912 --> 01:38:51,752
So we have a three minute and then I says that's on demand the next here.

868
01:38:51,992 --> 01:38:58,232
Well, let's try Chris. Okay. I want to, I want you to have this, um.

869
01:39:00,602 --> 01:39:06,711
So you can open your. Laptop or tablet.

870
01:39:06,712 --> 01:39:10,622
And then let me. Homeless. This is one.

871
01:39:10,802 --> 01:39:14,332
So you go to a kids one from week one.

872
01:39:14,342 --> 01:39:19,582
What pays? I think I have to put the.

873
01:39:21,642 --> 01:39:29,842
What was it that? And there are only three.

874
01:39:29,842 --> 01:39:44,382
QUESTION So. Please read the don't select and surrender.

875
01:39:44,712 --> 01:40:34,462
Okay. That.

876
01:41:54,022 --> 01:42:01,192
Okay. Okay.

877
01:42:01,192 --> 01:42:11,511
So 1150 So the so we will not go over this together, but once you enter and then submit your answer, then you will see a correct answer.

878
01:42:11,512 --> 01:42:16,612
And as you know, the explanation of the correct answer.

879
01:42:16,612 --> 01:42:17,802
So you can take a look.

880
01:42:17,812 --> 01:42:27,232
And then next week we will move to through look at this sampling method and then there there is a pre class or line lecture, so please watch.

881
01:42:27,712 --> 01:42:31,762
And then you have to complete the quiz to make.

882
01:42:32,942 --> 01:42:35,232
All right. I have a good week and see you next week.
