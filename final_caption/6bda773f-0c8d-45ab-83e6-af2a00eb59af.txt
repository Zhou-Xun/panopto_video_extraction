1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:08,020
It's okay. It's okay.

2
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:17,580
Hi, everybody. So today we're going to be circling around to thinking about policy options and policy tools again.

3
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:25,470
So right now, we're redoing the master's curriculum in the school's public health, and it proceeds in a way that I think you'll find recognizable.

4
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,510
If you want to have a masters, I recommend arts.

5
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:35,309
And it begins with highlighting the problem that good methods to develop point for the scale of the problem.

6
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:44,940
How much more ality and morbidity would we manage if we did something and then evaluate policy options and then decide on the policy option,

7
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:49,720
which is appropriate and then advocate for it. That's kind of the way we approach the health today.

8
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,479
And as in many of these classes, we're going to be saying that actually that's not quite the way you should think about it.

9
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,270
That's good science, but it's not necessarily good political action.

10
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,190
And what we're going to be focusing on instead is the way that policies change the

11
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:07,389
nature of the problem and its best policies change your ability to get it first,

12
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:12,340
best policy later. At the evolution of the problem changes the kind of policies that you need.

13
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:16,630
And we're going to be using the example of the opioid epidemic as a secondary theme.

14
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:22,210
The opioid epidemic is a great opportunity to examine something we've also already spoken about, which is social construction.

15
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:27,630
Because we've had the opioid epidemic in the United States before.

16
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:32,660
And that idea that we had one starting in the 1980s and still hasn't really stopped, it's just moved around.

17
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:38,719
And so we're going to be talking about the way that social that the political elite

18
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,690
and the political agenda socially constructs people who are suffering from opioids,

19
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:49,010
going to be able to watch how it shapes the policy tools that we find useful at the kinds of jurisdictions that adopt.

20
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:55,390
The key takeaway I want for you to look out is the policy options are mutual, but it's not just about what works.

21
00:01:55,400 --> 00:02:01,160
It's also about distributional consequences. You will often, for example, find that there's a strong preference for a policy.

22
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,440
These costs are borne by politically weak people,

23
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:08,930
even if a policy that looks some hard on people who are politically powerful would be way more effective.

24
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:19,060
There's also a lot of other reading, if you like, thick, heavily researched and utterly shocking books about very rich and depraved elites.

25
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:23,070
This is a great topic that. So let's go.

26
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:29,070
How did we get an opioid crisis in the United States? Now, if you go back to the 1980s and 1990,

27
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:38,510
part of the whole war on crime was the various tsunamis of illegal drugs that hit basically American urban environments.

28
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:46,500
And this has become much discussed. It really was part of the kind of pouring out of a lot of American cities that took place in the 1980s and 1990s.

29
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:52,049
And it fueled the creation of a lot of the tough on crime policies and politics around 1994,

30
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:56,520
when, among other things, desperate to find a way to put people in jail or that chair.

31
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:01,470
Congress went so far as to create the death penalty for the murder of a federal inspector on duty.

32
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:09,000
Right. They were that was where we got these tough on crime policies was out of a perception that we were losing control of our cities,

33
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:15,390
both on cable and watch movies from the 1980s and 1990. If you want to see kind of a lot of how the zeitgeist was working.

34
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,710
But the opioid crisis is nothing new.

35
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:26,600
I remember I first noticed it when Rush Limbaugh turned out to have a problem with prescription drugs and me not yet versed in this thought.

36
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,980
How do you get addicted to prescription drugs?

37
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,739
Is the whole system of prescriptions supposed to be designed so that you don't have patients running around

38
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:38,620
with addictions to drugs that are legal but only sold under the supervision of health care professionals?

39
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:42,440
What's going on? Well, extensive failures in healthcare.

40
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:52,740
Basically, a number of drug companies found ways to make their product much more salable without looking too closely what it was.

41
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:56,570
There was an enormous publicity campaign, for example, to face patients, clients.

42
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,820
And really, if you think chronic pain is not a problem, right?

43
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:05,270
If you're in chronic pain and you go to the health care system,

44
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:13,490
I think it's reasonable to expect the health care system to do its best to reduce your chronic pain goes for acute pain to, you know, post-operative.

45
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:21,799
So the fifth vital sign for pain made sense that there was a really, really big push by makers of opioids, notably Purdue Pharmaceuticals,

46
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:27,890
which if you go to art museums, that's the Sackler family who have paid for apparently every other art gallery in the United States of Britain.

47
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:36,460
Well, they've drug resistant the too, which is that they've rewarded people for getting more opioids despite.

48
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:41,530
And guess what? It turns out that if Purdue is making money producing the pharmaceuticals,

49
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:46,420
the sales reps are making money, the doctors are solving problems, will come back around to that one.

50
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:49,860
The distributors are making money. The pharmacists are making money out.

51
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:56,620
There's not a lot of incentive to look too closely to whether this particular replacement needs that much gabapentin afterwards.

52
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:04,580
Now go back to the docks. First of all, there's a lot of research on how doctors learn what's going on in the literature.

53
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,320
And I hate to break it to you.

54
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:11,780
It's not because they're conducting a systematic literature review on Saturday afternoon in order to keep up with things.

55
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:16,530
But a lot of the time, doctors get their information on sales reps, for example, which is by the drug companies.

56
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:22,160
But also look at the gaps in the American health care system. Let's go to West Virginia, for example.

57
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:29,180
One of the salient facts around West Virginia is that it has mountains and the drive time from one place to another can be strikingly low.

58
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,330
Like it's really easy place to get around if you're an eagle or something.

59
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:38,160
But if you're actually trying to get to the nearest health care facility, those ten miles involves going over mountains.

60
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:42,460
So you need to go 50. West Virginia has a lot of people with chronic pain.

61
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:48,310
All the reasons you can think of that people would end up with chronic pain tend to apply rather well in West Virginia.

62
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:54,489
West Virginia has a lot of people there for physical barriers to health care access, financial barriers to health care access,

63
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:59,650
and a lot of problems like that back to the West themselves to say, I have chronic pain, please do something about it.

64
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,510
What is the absolutely easiest thing to solve the problem?

65
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:07,700
You can't reorganize their lives.

66
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:14,660
You might not see them again because remember that 50 miles and who knows if their car works surface, it could have a snow or something.

67
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:23,080
Is to give them a really whacking great dose of the opioid that you have been assured has been reformulated to not be addictive.

68
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:31,480
We can touch on how it was actually more addictive as a result. Give me 60 cal bottle and hope that the problem goes away.

69
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,740
That's two months without chronic pain. Consult, right?

70
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:41,420
Guess what? Depending on your individual makeup, you could get addicted opioids in a week.

71
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:46,520
Two months is easily enough for a lot of people to develop a serious dependency.

72
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:53,670
If you don't know that, if you're trusting that the FDA and the drug company and the distributor and the pharmacist

73
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:57,000
and the sources of information in the medical journals that you're reading are all legit.

74
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,110
You can end up basically throwing 60 count pill bottles. I mean, I was astonished.

75
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:05,670
Just last year, a relative of mine was given a 60 count of gabapentin after a fairly minor operation,

76
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:15,190
and not in West Virginians about ten miles from here. So the doctors end up prescribing far too many opioids, which is creating addicts.

77
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:20,400
Right now, what happens when you're addicted and you want another 60 count?

78
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:28,139
All the pills. Well, if you go back to your doctor and plenty of doctors write that, but equally addictions,

79
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:31,890
as you know, have this way of demanding more and maybe your doctor cuts you off.

80
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:35,730
Says that next surgery was a year ago. You really should not be taking this many opioids.

81
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:41,820
What do you do if you're another doctor? You start shopping. The phrase for this is polypharmacy.

82
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:51,780
So there was no system in place to make sure the doctors would work all prescribing to the same person.

83
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:57,060
Right. So you get people shopping increasingly far and wide in order to get doctor school, write them prescriptions.

84
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,020
And furthermore, you start to get organized abuse, right?

85
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:04,760
Because let's say I'm a pharmacist who is discovering that an increasingly large share of my business is on opioids.

86
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:08,520
I believe that pain is the fifth vital sign you don't need to make me a criminal and your assumptions.

87
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:14,299
And I've got a patient whose doctor has cut them off. It's the easiest thing in the world to mention that there's another doctor down the

88
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:17,960
road who's actually takes this more seriously and might be willing to speak with you.

89
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:23,780
Needless to say, that's a nice pharmacist who's a bit naive in that story.

90
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:27,259
But there's also people who become properly organized abusers of the system.

91
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:31,100
Right. So we call them pill mills, which are these pharmacies?

92
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:37,549
For a long time they were in, of course, Florida, because Florida and Florida was one of the last states to do anything about this,

93
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:46,370
because Florida, where basically you would have literally busloads sort of semi criminal, it's not clear who they weren't necessarily.

94
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:51,260
Actors would charter busses from places like West Virginia down to Florida,

95
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:58,280
they'd all get their signed prescription from a doctor who might well have never seen them back up to West Virginia, straight to the pharmacy.

96
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:04,700
Get your pills. The next step, of course, since we now have no pretense that there's actual health care going on,

97
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:10,580
is instead of having it be for own use, why don't you fill a bus load with people and you don't care if they have pain?

98
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:17,990
You take them down to the pill mill, you bring them up, they get their prescriptions filled, and then they immediately sell them to you, the dealer.

99
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:22,700
And then you, the dealer can powder them and turn them into a properly addictive opioid for further sale on the street.

100
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,620
So it happens is you create a system based initially on essentially exploiting a number of

101
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:35,080
well-documented features of medical practice and failures of the American health care system.

102
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:44,670
Which creates sets of people who have incentives to promote and build an infrastructure for proper semi legal illegal opioid addictions.

103
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:50,280
So polypharmacy uncontrollable until you start keeping specific records of that.

104
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:56,780
You have addicts who are now if they're not getting it from something that looks kind of like the health care system, they're now addicted to opioids.

105
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:59,940
It's not that hard to start looking around and finding a heroin dealer.

106
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:05,009
You have the people running the pill mills. You have the people who have unscrupulous doctors.

107
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:08,160
They are all down. They there there's one who is busted in a very big way, Dearborn.

108
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:14,249
And the result is you get into a situation where you actually have something that looks pretty much like organized crime

109
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:18,990
happening in a lot of the United States in order to serve as fallout addicts were created substantially by accident.

110
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:23,159
One of the tip offs for this is that one of the ten largest opioid prescribing

111
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,100
pharmacies in the United States was in the middle of the Upper Peninsula,

112
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:29,550
and he went over here into the middle of the Upper Peninsula, I think throughout Newbury.

113
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:36,380
Does it look to you like they would have an absolutely gigantic population of people requiring high end opioids?

114
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:41,000
Does it, in fact, look awfully underpopulated to have a pharmacy at all?

115
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,420
Like I just drove to Escanaba or something. Right.

116
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:52,030
All ten of the top opioid distributing pharmacies were not in places where you would expect it.

117
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:59,410
So that's how we create the opioid crisis, in large part because we built it on trust notes like a bill saying We're trusting people.

118
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:07,590
In large part, we're trusting the pharmaceutical industry to not be, and that the court cases have made it clear, knowingly abetting.

119
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:12,630
The provision of drugs to people who are becoming addicted to the product.

120
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:22,750
I was just wondering what it is that the doctors overprescribe because they get like a couple of weeks.

121
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:28,210
What is the doctor's incentive there? That's the right question to ask.

122
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:34,360
Now, there's health care providers who employ doctors where you can start talking to the manager.

123
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:38,230
But broadly, the doctors got the problem.

124
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:45,679
Go away. I think that thing. But if you have any experience with anybody with that pain, it's bloody hard to get rid of it.

125
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,840
You can cycle indefinitely through acupuncture, yoga and surgeries.

126
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:55,580
A lot of the time what you need to do is lie down. Except you can't do that because you have a job.

127
00:11:56,090 --> 00:12:00,440
Except you need exercise. So you should lie down. But you can't exercise because that doesn't.

128
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:06,590
That's not what you do when you work at Walmart either. It's not structured exercise at Stanford, which is also bad for your bad.

129
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:13,040
And after a while getting a £60 get out of your it sounds like the most sensible way to deal with your problem.

130
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:23,320
Now, there's also a lot of subtle ways to pay off doctors. I used to teach executive masters students who were frequently doctors.

131
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,650
And they we tried it once, never again.

132
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,880
We did the online blog thing where everybody has to blog and respond to each other.

133
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:35,440
That was a very good use of a verb assignment again.

134
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:44,379
And the one time when they absolutely lost it and started calling each other Nazis was precisely on pharmaceutical rewards to doctors.

135
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:51,250
Right. So we covered abortion, smooth sailing, the Obama presidency, not a problem, but people take it very,

136
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:56,170
very personally if you tell them that going on an all expense paid visit to Bermuda

137
00:12:56,170 --> 00:13:00,850
in order to learn about new developments in pain management might constitute a bribe.

138
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,430
People don't like hearing that. And you're probably you'd have to be thinking a long way back of your lives.

139
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,130
But it used to be really common.

140
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:14,440
You'd be in a doctor's office waiting for something like a drug record covered with basically a pile of toys, you know,

141
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:21,800
really nice pens, milk, paper, coffee cups, anything you can brand with the name of like a strong antipsychotic.

142
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:26,860
And they'd literally just plop them down and flirt with the receptionist and leave. All they're doing there.

143
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:33,010
Is there any mark a timesheet for that? Right now we know that you've got a flirt and the receptionist is given a bunch of pens to the medical office.

144
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:36,550
Drug reps do a lot of that. By the way, what's the profession that they try to recruit from?

145
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:43,370
Name a thing you can do in college that substantially increases the odds that a drug company will try to hire you for sales.

146
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:51,779
Regardless of your gender. Notice I said a thing you could do at college.

147
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:58,250
So it's not a major. Cheerleader.

148
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:07,490
Come on, people. So cheerleaders turn out to have most of the makings of a great drug rep, including, by definition, they look quite healthy.

149
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:12,010
Right. You don't want to sort of, you know, run out, you know, a drug that looks like me.

150
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:15,860
You want someone who really looks like the peak of this. Okay.

151
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:23,540
So there's a lot of that in health care system. So even if nobody got anything that looked like a formal kickback or a bribe,

152
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:28,580
you can see how I will be predisposed to listen to people who take me on a three

153
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:33,940
day paid vacation or who involve me in a research project that has no I or B,

154
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:38,540
it will never see the light of day. Or if it does see the light of day, it's in a paid for medical journal article,

155
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:44,300
but which allow me to be compensated as part of the research thing and post about my research prowess and so forth.

156
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:50,059
Basically, anybody in sales, like anybody espionage knows how to push people's thoughts, right?

157
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:53,300
Do they want money? Do they want to steal? Do they want to hide something? That's about it.

158
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:04,330
But we now have an opioid epidemic. And because the opioid epidemic started by definition among people who are insured,

159
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,580
it doesn't look like an opioid epidemic among people who are miserable in the industrialized cities.

160
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:16,630
And it also means that we have a policy tool. We have the tool to try to manipulate the health care system itself.

161
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,630
Right. Because this problem came out of the health care system. So we can start to choke it off at the health care system.

162
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:26,440
Here are three things. The first thing is the prescription registry. Right.

163
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:31,210
This solves two problems. One is it allows us to identify polypharmacy.

164
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:36,490
All right. So you come in and you say, hey, I say, hey, maybe some oxycodone would be good for you.

165
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:41,900
Oh, gosh. It would appear you have several hundred of them that you picked up at Walgreens last week.

166
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:50,380
I think you might have enough of that stuff. Right. So it cuts down on polypharmacy because it says people receive it as have to prove it.

167
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:57,880
So they are. And then you notice that somehow there's this guy who's got 25 doctors and they're all prescribing pain medication.

168
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:02,649
Secondly, it makes it much easier to identify problematic doctors.

169
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:08,210
They busted one in cell field who had written an absolutely extraordinary number, like millions and billions of dollars with prescriptions.

170
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:09,969
If you're a patient every 2 minutes,

171
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:18,910
which is a technical term for not seeing it and what's going on there is you look at this and these guys really think about it because it

172
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:25,420
turns out that there were a lot of doctors who are slowly getting the message or noticing that this wasn't doing their patients any good.

173
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:31,420
And there were some doctors who really needed. You know, it doesn't take that money.

174
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:39,370
All you need is one guy with I have no idea what gambling debts, you know, some kind of a bad habit addiction to his own product.

175
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,190
What else? You don't need many of the people.

176
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:48,370
If you already have this organized system for distributing opioids in a way that isn't exactly the intention of the law.

177
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:53,310
Secure prescription registry. And that picks up two problems.

178
00:16:53,310 --> 00:17:00,030
It blocks polypharmacy and it allows you to start identifying doctors whose practices you might wish to refer to the state board,

179
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:06,150
if not the county prosecutor. No prizes for guessing what the last state was to adopt this.

180
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:12,810
Also, no prizes in America for picking up and getting these things to work across state lines is really hard, right?

181
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:19,649
So I would say there's a compelling interest that, say, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania should be able to exchange this information.

182
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:23,940
But of course, they set it up at different times with different vendors. So it was difficult.

183
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:28,680
And in three states that all had a shared problem, you didn't have the communication for a while.

184
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:34,950
Second thing you could do then is start actually getting these county prosecutors in these

185
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:39,750
state boards to do something because they all have obligations not to do this right.

186
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:45,330
Everybody down the line has an obligation in one way or another, legally not to be a drug pusher.

187
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,440
Doctors are supposed to do practice in the interest of the patient.

188
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:54,390
Pharmacists are supposed to make sure that the drugs didn't do any harm to the people that they sell them to.

189
00:17:54,900 --> 00:18:02,100
Drug distributors are licensed precisely because they're not the sort of, shall we say, informal type of drug distributor.

190
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:09,120
Right. That's how you get to have a license to a monopoly of trucks driving around full of controlled substances, etc.

191
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:15,329
So what happens? The American legal system cranks into gear like the United States isn't very good

192
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:19,590
at regulating private companies who rely on civil lawsuits to deter bad behavior,

193
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:23,070
which is why we have this endless fight over tort reform,

194
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:28,680
which is a code word for diminishing the ability of people to sue companies for bad behavior.

195
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,569
Because if you can't sue them after the fact,

196
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:34,380
then you can't regulate them ahead of fact they could do what they want, which is an objective for some people.

197
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:39,239
So we start suing them and a lot of what we know comes precisely from Discovery,

198
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:45,930
where you release the evidence of the behavior of, for example, Purdue Pharmaceuticals and watching how drug reps behave.

199
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:48,690
And their incentivize is kind of gruesomely fascinating.

200
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:55,400
So you start enforcing these obligations, you start leaning on the state boards to take a little bit more seriously.

201
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:59,270
You start leaning on state boards of various forms of practice licensing.

202
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:10,130
And you also have big lawsuits McKesson, Cardinal Health, Walgreens, Purdue Pharmaceuticals, people trying to sue the Sackler family personally.

203
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:15,920
So we're starting to deter future bad behavior by going after them.

204
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,960
But there's a problem with both of these, right?

205
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:26,500
What happens if you have somebody who's fully addicted to the point where they're practicing polypharmacy and you cut them off?

206
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:36,630
What are they going to do? Go cold turkey.

207
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:46,200
You could probably find a street killer.

208
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:49,680
Exactly. That's how we get a black out heroin epidemic.

209
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:56,400
Part of the innovation of the people selling black tar heroin, which is even by the standards of injectable heroin,

210
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:01,800
terrible stuff, is they realize that there was a new pool of addictive people at places like Columbus, Ohio.

211
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:08,190
Right. So instead of going over and over again with the same pool of people addicted to Detroit, you branch out.

212
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:12,060
You start developing good coverage in the suburbs. You start delivering good customer service.

213
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:18,180
You do basic customer retention models. Like if somebody stops ordering from you, stop like three beautiful cars.

214
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,700
Hey, you know, keep car. I'm still in the business. We miss you. You know those e-mails you get if you buy something online?

215
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:31,820
Heroin dealers do that, too. And also I always model drugs as a business.

216
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:35,480
We have other activities, you know, for example, fentanyl, it's cheaper.

217
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:41,120
You can print, it's easier to produce, it's far more potent also control.

218
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:45,889
But that means that you can become a much more efficient business by distributing fentanyl black tar.

219
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:53,000
Heroin was essentially a byproduct that they were able to rush in, even though it messed up your veins even more than normal heroin injection.

220
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:57,860
And because they suddenly realized there was a big market that needed some kind of opioids because they

221
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:02,270
could pulled off a prescription once and then they started marketing it as you do as a good business.

222
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:08,440
But fentanyl, which is causing these huge waves of overdoses, is far more powerful.

223
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:14,170
So the fact that it's very efficient from the point of view of business creates the problem that you

224
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:17,620
get these regular news stories where a bunch of high school students think it has the perfect set.

225
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:22,450
It turns out they're all dead because it's fentanyl. It's infinitely more powerful and infinitely, but a lot.

226
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:29,210
So what do we do to the extent that we cut off?

227
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:38,240
Seven. Illegal abuse of the health care system will create a market for illegal drugs.

228
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:45,839
So now we do have a proper criminalization issue because it's a lot easier to report a doctor to the State

229
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:54,150
Board of Medicine or to sue McKesson than it is to address organized crime once it's become entrenched,

230
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:59,570
because nobody hasn't said at the turn of the dealer. Or most of the time kept alive.

231
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:08,990
So what would you do to make treatment more widely available? Right. And that was the patty strike, another article about Sullivan County, New York.

232
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:15,210
How hard it is to actually get people into treatment. So what's the problem with treatment?

233
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,040
Start with the fact that it's low status, right? In the hierarchy of status.

234
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:28,200
Basically, professionals take their status from their clients. So as you might imagine, in heart surgeons, they're doing hard work.

235
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:34,260
They're trained extensively. And they also have basically a demographic of well insured, older white guys.

236
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:38,640
Well, guess what? That's pretty, pretty high status in the society as it currently works.

237
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:44,549
If you're dealing with people who have serious opioid addiction and to the extent that their status report is your status,

238
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:52,160
it probably doesn't feel much good as a professional. Now the drugs that we use to treat opioids are themselves opioids, right?

239
00:22:52,170 --> 00:23:01,210
Stuff like within the movement of the drugs that we use to treat them are opioids.

240
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:08,350
Right. So they're also controlled substances. Which means that you have to have the facilities.

241
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:14,510
You know, you can't do house calls. You probably don't want to read it through your normal doctor's office.

242
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:18,909
And instead you have all these policies that we've designed because it's an opioid, it's a controlled substance.

243
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:23,200
Like you have to take the thing under the supervision of somebody else so that you don't end

244
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,410
up addicted to a new drug or selling it on the street to people who just want their day.

245
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:32,040
So there's a ton of scrutiny. The Drug Enforcement Agency is very active here.

246
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:36,420
Now, if you're setting up a medical office, does this sound like an appealing field to go into?

247
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,930
Like you're dealing with.

248
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:46,390
Essentially, the federal government is opening on the presumption that you're a drug dealer, which is brilliantly ironic, right.

249
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:51,639
I can set up in pain medicine and hand out all the pills I want, but if I set up an addiction recovery medicine,

250
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:55,210
then I basically have my own private DEA agents sitting in my office half the time.

251
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:02,509
Who can provide treatment is therefore highly regulated. And then furthermore, there's endless rules.

252
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:09,110
Right. And this comes from two sources. What is the DEA has an opinion about the conditions under which you give people opioids.

253
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:13,350
Like a really common one is a restriction which Strack writes about.

254
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:20,760
You have to be clean before you can start treatment. Now, this is a fairly common thing in addiction recovery medicine,

255
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:25,050
because having somebody is out of their gourd on drugs is a really bad way to begin a treatment.

256
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:31,170
But on the other hand, guess what? People who are heavily addicted are generally not clean.

257
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:39,420
So you end up with a bed. With the bed can't be occupied because there's nobody to occupy the bed who fulfills the request to get in there.

258
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:45,419
Furthermore, even if you started your addiction, you had health insurance because you had a job, you get heavily enough addicted.

259
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:50,250
You probably don't have a job anymore, at which point you don't have health insurance, at which point a bunch of states would a problem.

260
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,820
So we don't have good ways of paying for treatment.

261
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:58,720
Right now, the insurers are not fans of substance use disorder treatment.

262
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:04,419
So health insurance policies are often not very helpful at all, even the quite lavish ones, right?

263
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:10,660
Because you compete for people, they say we'll give you any surgery within 48 hours because we have the highest rates for this procedure.

264
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:17,320
You generally don't compete for most buyers by saying we have really good substance use disorder coverage, because guess what?

265
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:21,820
You're going to get people with substance use disorders in their family and that's going to be costly.

266
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:30,549
Result, we do a good job of choking off the supply of opioids through the health care system.

267
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:32,260
Not perfect, but pretty good, right?

268
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:39,340
And we're systematically grinding our way through all the bad actors doing things that we hope will deter them from doing bad things in the future.

269
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:45,360
And people who are systematic, bad actors like that pharmacist up in the U.P. are in serious legal trouble.

270
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:51,759
And we don't need to worry too much about it. But when you cut off the drug supply, what you do is create a boom in illegal drug supply,

271
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,930
hence the fentanyl black tar problems that we've been having more fentanyl these days.

272
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,870
The solution to this is to dry up the pool of addicts,

273
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:08,690
but that requires a the regulatory system for more controlled substances to operate and be someone to

274
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:14,780
pay for an expensive treatment combined with see a supply of people who wish to supply that treatment.

275
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:19,250
Ideally with all these rules be constantly hassle and doing something comparatively

276
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:23,630
well status of in interviews the providers will say I did this for love,

277
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:23,950
right?

278
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:33,140
I could triple my income and cut my hassle with the government in half at the insurers house if I just reset myself up as a normal family doctor.

279
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:38,520
Or you know, if I have a higher specialist qualification, I could make even more money.

280
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:43,060
So you're deterring people who can actually solve the problem from solving the problem.

281
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:51,140
So what's the result? You change the profile of mortality, right?

282
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:56,660
So we address the policy tools on the front end of cutting off the supply for the health care system.

283
00:26:57,260 --> 00:27:02,510
But now the problem's changed and it's it's been has to size like it's integrated into more parts of society.

284
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:07,070
So first of all, we end up with a really big toll of opioid addiction.

285
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:13,600
You know the phrase depths of despair. Anyone want to define it or do I have?

286
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:21,650
I'm trying to gauge whether, like you all had a 90 minute lecture about it or if it's just something you came across.

287
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:29,230
Okay. American life expectancy even before it was going backwards.

288
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:35,320
Right. And basically, rule of thumb, life expectancy at which society goes down during war for America.

289
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:40,450
It's not supposed to just start going down. Right. Life expectancy is go down.

290
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:49,420
If you decompose how life expectancy was going down, the pattern that emerged and this is something demographers are still thinking about a lot.

291
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:53,740
So don't take it as gospel. But I think the evidence comes down on the side of this is the problem.

292
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:59,840
It was primarily concentrated among middle aged white people.

293
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:07,770
And the causes of death were things that you would associate with despair, things like liver disease, accidents, drug overdoses.

294
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:16,469
In other words, we're accustomed to thinking about drugs as being as drug damage, as being sort of a young person's thing.

295
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:22,460
And this is something quite different. This is just basically that's what we call the deaths of despair.

296
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:29,879
A lot of the argument as to whether despair is driving it. But you're seeing a lot of basically voluntary self poisoning in the hands of drugs,

297
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:37,950
alcohol and associated things like a lot of they are that road traffic deaths are associated with drugs and alcohol is surprising to us.

298
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:45,509
Calling it deaths of despair in the context of the Trump election meant that our national political elites suddenly got really,

299
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:53,040
really interested in all these counties that had swung from Democratic to Trump voting and also suddenly had this apparent crisis,

300
00:28:53,040 --> 00:29:00,929
not just in their politics. Politics is one thing, but also literally a demographic of the population that normally doesn't do that kind of thing.

301
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:05,819
Suddenly doing it on such a grand scale like this, the scrambled the brains of our political elites.

302
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:11,240
That's not how they thought about problems. So this music gets coded sympathetically to both parties.

303
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:20,090
The opioid epidemic is a problem in Baltimore. It is a problem in Detroit, but that doesn't have L.A. The media is profoundly bored with that.

304
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:28,100
Instead, the novelty is middle class, middle aged white people in East Liverpool, Ohio or what have you.

305
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:32,570
Right. That's a novel thing. And furthermore, it's coded, sympathetic Democrats.

306
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:37,040
First of all, they're still interested in Detroit and Baltimore because they're politicians from there.

307
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:41,030
But also Democrats are interested in many of these policy issues.

308
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:47,050
And at the same time, Republicans are seeing as I think it's emerging right in their backyard populations they represent about.

309
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:54,490
So you start coding this as a different kind of problem that you don't solve by sending in the National Guard.

310
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:57,980
You don't solve by militarized police who have a huge criminal penalties.

311
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:04,300
And you can watch. I thought about pulling one of these images, but frankly, it's too disturbing.

312
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,480
We see all sorts of local stuff like the East Liverpool,

313
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:15,160
Ohio Police Department had a sideline for a while showing photographs of people like half dead of overdoses in the car with their child in the car,

314
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:20,340
seat the back. Or some little toddler trying to revive her mommy in Iowa, Dollar General,

315
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:26,760
where others passed out because she overdosed on putting a police department's all across rural America, tweeting the stuff out.

316
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:32,160
I'll leave on the side whether that's good policy by the police department.

317
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:39,980
Furthermore, you get widespread use of heroin and synthetic opioids like fentanyl on there.

318
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:44,130
So if you have a bunch of addicts who are receiving the drug and you cut them off,

319
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:47,220
they're going to find the drug and people are going to find ways to find the drug for them.

320
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:55,170
Now I want you to notice that we therefore end up with agreement that this is a problem for the United States.

321
00:30:55,180 --> 00:31:01,509
Right. This is an area of bipartisan concern. Now, what people want to do about it varies by party, by what interests they listen to.

322
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:05,589
Another think about the problem, but it's been coded as essentially a white,

323
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:09,610
middle aged person problem affecting the entire country, and that gets a different treatment.

324
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:16,960
This is the whole story of drugs in the United States. The social construction of the using population drives the policies that we adopt.

325
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:25,590
So crack got socially constructed as an inner city black problem and we gave it 20 years of militarized policing, which did a lot of damage.

326
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:30,070
It didn't particularly affect the trajectory of the epidemic. Opioids.

327
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:40,500
Like crystal meth beforehand got quoted as a how can the beautiful barns country, you know, rolling hills of American farms be hit by this epidemic?

328
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:44,400
And you even see drugs change. Right. Let's talk about marijuana earlier.

329
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:49,380
Marijuana, when it was coded as a hippie thing and a mexican thing by our political elites,

330
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:56,490
got militarized response and their education and all that good stuff there, by the way, appears to, if anything, slightly increased drug use.

331
00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:05,889
But the police departments really enjoyed it. When it got recoded for what it is, which is it's a thing that middle class people do on weekends,

332
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:09,280
basically, and not as a happy subversion of society.

333
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:13,660
Guess what? We legalized it entirely. We didn't even bother medicalized it along the way.

334
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:20,830
Alcohol gets legalized, so medicalised alcohol abuse disorder gets treated as a medical problem.

335
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:27,730
A lot of other drugs get treated skills, criminal problems. And that's one reason we have such a high level of incarceration in this country.

336
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:32,200
So what do we do from today?

337
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:39,940
This is the call very ardently red. Excellent access laws, opening it up, opening up overdose prevention sites.

338
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:43,420
Now, that's a tricky one, right? Federal legislation blocks them at the moment.

339
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:49,210
You can't have what amount to invisibly sponsored places to take drugs, take illegal drugs.

340
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:53,530
Now, there's pushback against this, right? San Francisco is trying to open them, for example.

341
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:56,350
But kind of the core problem is that in theory,

342
00:32:56,350 --> 00:33:02,500
the federal government could come after you as a city government as well as anybody who happens to be on the site at any time they choose.

343
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:09,490
It's an overdose prevention site, basically clean needles, opportunity to get some treatment if you rather not be there at all.

344
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:17,440
And frankly, somebody who's there, if you do overdose, you can instantly try to revive you because we do have technologies that revive people.

345
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:23,000
If you get to the. Really. Prescription drug monitoring programs see above.

346
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:30,100
Pharmacists dispensing naphthalene. Government backed media campaign writes very to reduce the stigma around opioid addiction.

347
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:32,170
On one hand, the government would be the first right.

348
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:38,350
Two Super Bowls ago, one of the highest profile ads was for the laxative that you need if you take opioids a lot.

349
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:45,030
So what a country, right? Some of the most expensive ad territory on the most watched television event of the year.

350
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:48,830
And we're having an ad for a specific laxative opioid use.

351
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:57,100
Everything is just fine, clearly. But reduce the stigma because stigmatized things get hit.

352
00:33:57,310 --> 00:34:01,879
Once things have been hit, then they tend not to get dealt with until they're so bad that they come out of hiding.

353
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:05,170
And by then you have fewer options and worse options for dealing with them.

354
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:09,880
The other one is taxing the opioids to pay for publicly funded drug treatment.

355
00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:13,299
The insidious incidence of this tax, we have absolutely no idea,

356
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:20,080
but it'll probably end up landing on initially pharmaceuticals and afterwards, you know, Medicare, whoever is paying for it.

357
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:25,260
Grant funding for community oriented research and evaluation were professors.

358
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:31,589
We think that's a great idea. Treatment, coverage, expansion and combined with relaxed regulation of treatment centers, which is,

359
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:37,640
like I said, non-controversial in Tennessee, can be an addictive drug if it can be an addictive drug.

360
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:44,580
So if you relapses, you risk going back to step one and getting more pills except medical treatments.

361
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:49,260
You can easily imagine how that would happen. So relaxing restrictions involves threading the needle.

362
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:56,610
So these are the things we're talking about now. And notice how some of them kind of legacy prescription drug monitoring programs to solving

363
00:34:56,610 --> 00:35:01,590
a problem by continuing to do what we have mostly already done that maybe doing it better.

364
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:08,350
And the other direction is thinking about ways to get more treatment. Ways to finance more treatment, ways to reduce barriers to treatment.

365
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:14,990
So what have we have going for us is a bipartisan agreement that this is a problem.

366
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:25,340
Because it has been coded as a problem that both parties like, right, as in the target populations that have been constructed,

367
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:30,730
include target populations of interest to both political parties as well as kind of broadly our national.

368
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:37,180
See, have options, do this kind of stuff that you don't have if it's confirmed, something that's coded differently.

369
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,370
These aren't all equally effective, right? Go back around.

370
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:49,879
If you think about the idea you're supposed to do is to figure out the problem, figure out the size of the problem,

371
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:53,170
to figure out the most effective response is to develop and advocate for that.

372
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:55,000
You're going to end up with a list of what actually works.

373
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,870
If you do it through an equity lens, you're going to come up with a somewhat different list as well.

374
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:06,330
But what you also want to do is think through what is politically possible and you want to think about time.

375
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:13,229
And by time I mean things that could have choked off the opioid epidemic back when it was a problem of doctors handing

376
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:21,480
out 60 counts of oxycodone has now turned into very large organized crime problems that are embedded in society.

377
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:26,420
I think overdose rates in some rural counties, particularly in the Ohio Valley, are just nuts like.

378
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:31,550
You really kind of have to wonder in a place like Scott County, Indiana,

379
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:37,460
like you have to get it through your head that something like every fourth adult you meet might be addicted opioids.

380
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:41,500
It's a very pretty county, by the way.

381
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:49,690
So it's made for media because it's rolling hills and Bard's cute little towns with big faces and a gigantic disaster.

382
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:53,740
So you can imagine that 60, 60 Minutes just love to go out there filming.

383
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:59,930
Okay. So that's enough of me. Because our options.

384
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:07,620
We're going to do roots for the state. You seem to be good at picking a diversity of states.

385
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:13,360
That's basically I just want you to pick a state based on knowing the minimum about it's politics, right?

386
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:18,400
You don't need a heavily detailed analysis of it. Just can you tell your Idaho from your Washington state something?

387
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:24,960
And then there's a jam board, lengthy canvas. Assess the three E's.

388
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:30,330
The three E's will never leave you. But also their political feasibility, right?

389
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:35,190
So each of these policies you're going to give for grades low, medium and high.

390
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:44,790
And we want to be able to talk about your answers. This in about 10 minutes, we'll be circulating.

391
00:37:46,180 --> 00:38:13,260
Go. I think I don't think I don't know.

392
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:38,550
I would love to get out of here.

393
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:54,080
Oh, I know, I know.

394
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:06,430
Yeah, just. Yeah.

395
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:33,280
Let's see.

396
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:02,460
Oh, yeah.

397
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:09,550
Oh, that's great.

398
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:19,870
Yes, I think so.

399
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:43,420
I mean, it's not actually hopes and fears.

400
00:40:46,140 --> 00:41:10,330
It is something that is sort of like this.

401
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:53,590
Okay, I hear that. Yeah, I think this is this is serious business and leisure.

402
00:41:54,400 --> 00:42:25,150
And I understand what you're saying here.

403
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:43,430
Yeah, I just heard I.

404
00:42:54,460 --> 00:43:07,990
Yeah, I know what you're saying.

405
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:12,310
I guess so.

406
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:18,090
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

407
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:26,820
Oh, I'm sorry.

408
00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:31,380
I was just like.

409
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:44,560
I'm so sorry about that.

410
00:43:46,630 --> 00:44:14,810
Well, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

411
00:44:15,730 --> 00:44:45,370
Well, or the difference is that it make it look like.

412
00:44:49,690 --> 00:45:21,670
Think. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

413
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:41,650
I was happy because this is a very strange situation.

414
00:45:42,680 --> 00:46:02,150
Yeah. No, I think it's kind of like I said.

415
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:15,010
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

416
00:46:18,470 --> 00:46:26,860
Yeah, that's true.

417
00:46:27,430 --> 00:46:37,600
Yeah, I was there.

418
00:46:40,660 --> 00:47:49,510
Night. I'm very concerned because they are saying that this is the second time this has happened.

419
00:47:52,020 --> 00:48:50,990
Oh, I. That's why I would if someone takes a look at this, that they want to know what is going on.

420
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:16,750
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

421
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:48,650
Oh, yeah, yeah.

422
00:49:53,190 --> 00:50:08,080
Yeah. I mean, it's already happening.

423
00:50:09,970 --> 00:51:24,470
Yeah. I mean, want to that it is one that I was just like, you know, I, I have to say, but I have to ask,

424
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:49,760
you know, like I said, I really like I was like, you know, like I felt like I am but doesn't.

425
00:51:51,150 --> 00:52:15,990
Isn't that what we need to bring out for their rights and civil society?

426
00:52:16,600 --> 00:53:09,030
Well, I mean, I think it's all because I didn't get it, because it's so different this time or something like that.

427
00:53:13,200 --> 00:55:33,990
I guess right now. I mean, I'm not sure why this is not something I know, but as I said, it's not like I ran into the school district.

428
00:55:34,350 --> 00:56:13,710
I feel like, you know, we're just getting a bit like it was a couple of years ago.

429
00:56:21,270 --> 00:56:50,720
And I was like, okay, in the last minute, pick the things that you would most wish to take.

430
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:55,940
To your state based on the combination of all of them. And take the thing you most regret.

431
00:56:55,940 --> 00:57:00,829
You would not take your state. In other words, choose the things that you most like the past.

432
00:57:00,830 --> 00:57:06,110
But you think it's doomed. And pick the thing that you think your governor and state legislature would just sign up immediately.

433
00:57:13,390 --> 00:57:34,180
So again, I look at the ballot with the greatest experiment against America, with Pakistan for some reason.

434
00:57:41,150 --> 00:57:52,180
So I don't know how to make these decisions.

435
00:57:56,530 --> 00:58:16,400
And what you see here is, of course, the question, which came from your right to study area and market at the same time.

436
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:25,650
That's what's going on here. Yeah, you do.

437
00:58:28,270 --> 00:58:33,700
Okay. So I'm tempted to pick the poor person who happened to be skeptical.

438
00:58:33,750 --> 00:58:42,820
I grabbed a microphone, and I want you to do that. So which of you is most sad about a great policy idea that you don't think is going to happen?

439
00:58:46,790 --> 00:58:50,720
Everybody's doing everything right. All the states.

440
00:58:54,150 --> 00:58:59,379
Let's go. Looking for.

441
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:03,360
Here is the gap between different values within political efforts.

442
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:17,050
Everything's even related. Overdose prevention sites.

443
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:23,700
Even on those. Yeah, well, he was.

444
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:27,470
I think we're going to have places for people to go.

445
00:59:34,010 --> 00:59:37,200
Oh, in California, we thought it.

446
00:59:38,910 --> 00:59:43,220
The governor vetoed the effort to make more intervention.

447
00:59:43,350 --> 00:59:47,730
States do this. They just said that it was because he didn't think it was law.

448
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:53,459
But he said he'd be like, okay, passing a public health section.

449
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:57,120
So that's not like something that went.

450
00:59:59,310 --> 01:00:04,210
And that's if California and by the way, that has all the fingerprints of somebody once for a president.

451
01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:08,470
Right. He showed what he's shown. Willingness. He hasn't been insulted.

452
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:11,690
That will get you. I stood up.

453
01:00:14,140 --> 01:00:24,890
The policy idea that we got interested in, we like to see. Um, we were talking about how but we didn't say.

454
01:00:25,930 --> 01:00:31,059
And the treatment coverage extension is that it was equitable, effective.

455
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:43,740
And I didn't see it because it is a party that has created people to want them to be interested in it.

456
01:00:44,650 --> 01:00:49,750
So that's an interesting point because Kentucky is nobody's idea of a generous state, but they've got Medicaid expansion.

457
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:57,100
They have Democratic governors. And you're saying this might be a place isn't the White House against the proposal of.

458
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:03,570
Of the Southern. Obviously one.

459
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:24,579
Actually. We also had concerns that we were looking at what the maximum access laws and how right now is to regulate it,

460
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:31,750
as in only certain pharmacists can distribute it to any that restrictions like it.

461
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:36,670
And again, I think we can carry it like forever.

462
01:01:36,670 --> 01:01:48,639
If you don't have to have a prescription, you have to go right necessarily through a pharmacist to get things here that are accessible and get it.

463
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:50,700
And it's not because of anything else.

464
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:58,360
I think considering the fact that they're super open about how big of a problem it is and also the fact that they have other.

465
01:01:59,850 --> 01:02:06,060
These are the similar programs that syringe service programs like exchanging needles and stuff like that.

466
01:02:06,830 --> 01:02:12,990
Those are more effective and accessible than asbestos.

467
01:02:14,070 --> 01:02:18,150
So it's kind of an interesting puzzle why you don't have better laws on that subject.

468
01:02:18,750 --> 01:02:22,170
But it also, if they recognize the problem, it will help.

469
01:02:22,170 --> 01:02:33,690
This might be something you push for. So what I like to see you're getting is blend of what's a good idea and what's equitable with efficient,

470
01:02:33,690 --> 01:02:36,330
what's effective, and also what's politically like.

471
01:02:37,050 --> 01:02:41,960
And we're doing it in an area where this is like one of the nice areas of American health policy, I believe,

472
01:02:41,970 --> 01:02:50,340
because there is this level of bipartisan agreement on this problem and of a problem that you can actually have conversations

473
01:02:50,340 --> 01:02:57,010
across normally politically polarized political parties about stuff that was an absolute anathema 20 years ago.

474
01:02:57,030 --> 01:03:03,060
Right. The concept of a municipal sharing of sites with health care available on sites would have

475
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:06,960
it would your political demise pretty much anywhere in the United States 20 years ago?

476
01:03:07,890 --> 01:03:16,360
Okay. Here's your takeaways. Your choice of policy tools is just the fact that this is political and it's got distributional consequences.

477
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:19,570
Some people blame and some people lose. Frequently,

478
01:03:19,750 --> 01:03:23,770
research is a thing that you do because you don't actually try to solve the problem because you know

479
01:03:23,770 --> 01:03:28,110
roughly what would solve the problem and you know how to do it because the food box gets more.

480
01:03:30,150 --> 01:03:36,150
At the time. It depends on the coding and targeting. Coding the target population would be having a very, very difficult conversation.

481
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:43,200
If opioids were being presented as a problem of Baltimore and not the problem of your Ohio,

482
01:03:43,470 --> 01:03:46,710
with all the cultural coding and political implications of that breaks.

483
01:03:47,870 --> 01:03:55,700
And finally, the policy is fast effective, right? So by the time we had choked off most of the misuse of the health care system.

484
01:03:56,900 --> 01:04:02,059
Lovely anecdote I heard from one group of students that apparently they're still getting opioids from wisdom teeth in some cases.

485
01:04:02,060 --> 01:04:07,060
So there's clearly some more stuff to be done. Once you chop that off, the nature of the problem has changed.

486
01:04:07,070 --> 01:04:14,050
You have a new problem, which is that you're rapidly, by virtue of solving the old problem, creating the Mexican mafia in the local epidemic.

487
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:18,730
So bear in mind your choice of tools.

488
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:26,070
They're not neutral. They're politically salient. And over time, what tool adopted to foreclose your ability to adopt other tools?

489
01:04:27,810 --> 01:04:30,840
Okay. We'll be discussing the Supreme Court next.

490
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:35,910
You.
