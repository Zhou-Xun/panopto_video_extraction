1
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:09,300
Imagine walking up to the sink in your house, turning the closet and having nothing come out.

2
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:16,650
For the many Native Americans living within the boundaries of Navajo Nation in the southwestern U.S.,

3
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:22,950
that's their reality on a weekly basis with its location in the southwest,

4
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:30,270
Navajo Nation is incredibly susceptible to climate change and most notably susceptible to severe drought,

5
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:34,650
which has been plaguing that region on the reservation.

6
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:46,050
Nearly one third of the houses don't have reliable running water, causing huge problems with water infrastructure and its relation to climate change.

7
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:51,930
Traditionally, some areas that access to creeks, wells, sometimes aquifers,

8
00:00:51,930 --> 00:01:02,590
but unfortunately with the arid climate and the drought getting worse while as are drying up and these aquifers are becoming more and more salinity.

9
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:08,770
This systemic impression of this marginalized population is further illustrated by the fact that a

10
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:15,010
large portion of their land was flooded to create the second largest reservoir in the United States.

11
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:20,170
And this water is being prioritized for cities like Phoenix and Las Vegas,

12
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:28,280
as opposed to being used to bring water infrastructure to those who live on the reservation.

13
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:37,640
Above and beyond issues with water already a food desert, the lack of both running water for homes as well as running water for agriculture,

14
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:46,250
is further compounded by the land getting dried out and being unable to sustain produce such as corn, a staple in the Navajo diet.

15
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:51,470
Additionally, things like traditional medicinal plants are no longer able to be grown on the reservation,

16
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:58,520
and food is perishing quickly in houses that don't have reliable electricity and especially air conditioning.

17
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:04,260
On top of all of this, traditional livestock such as sheep are perishing as well.

18
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:07,500
Above and beyond the community level at an individual level.

19
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:16,290
Climate change is disproportionately affecting the Navajo, especially due to their health, comorbidities, things like obesity, diabetes,

20
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:25,620
hypertension, coronary heart disease are all made even more kind of impactful in their daily lives with that hot heat during the droughts.

21
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:30,000
All of these conditions predispose people to things like heat exhaustion with diabetes.

22
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,920
Controlling sugar can be harder in the heat, so it's kind of a spiraling of these conditions.

23
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,780
On top of all of this, all of these factors come together to a loss of culture.

24
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:47,640
Many people in Navajo Nation are required to leave the reservation,

25
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:53,170
seeking out areas with more reliable kind of basic amenities like water, electricity, stuff like that.

26
00:02:53,170 --> 00:03:02,136
A requirement isn't quite as big of a deal. Leaving, you know, kind of a dry, arid land in their place.
