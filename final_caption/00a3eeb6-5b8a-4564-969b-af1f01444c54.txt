00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,710
My name is Jason Doleac, and this is an interview with Christina Gomez.

2
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:09,930
So, Christina, tell me, why are you interested in this position?

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:16,620
Well, I'm interested in this position for various reasons. One, it's just to apply the knowledge I've learned while I've been here in graduate school.

4
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:27,420
I think where I've been now has prepared me for this position, and I think it's incredibly important to help others understand what I have learned.

5
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:32,760
And I feel as if, let's say you kind blink in here on it,

6
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:41,520
but just I feel like this company is very innovative and I'm also a very innovative person as well.

7
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:51,370
I really feel like I can offer myself up and help those in this workplace using the knowledge that I have gained again.

8
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:58,440
So tell me, what are some of your strengths and weaknesses? Well, some of my strengths are definitely I love communication.

9
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:03,900
I think communication is incredibly important when working in the workplace, especially working with a large amount of people.

10
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:13,230
I think also being able to effectively be able to rely on other people and not be afraid to go to other people.

11
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:18,330
I have no issue with being dependent and I have no issue with asking for help

12
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:21,750
because I think that's the most important thing as well as for weaknesses.

13
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,440
I'd have to say that I have a tendency to be a little overly social,

14
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:30,509
and I know sometimes I can be a little overbearing for some people, and I have been working on that.

15
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:39,050
But I do think at the same time I can use that weakness of being over social to make the workplace more entertaining, more trustworthy.

16
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:44,130
And another strength I have to actually that I just thought of is that I'm an extremely transparent person.

17
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:49,769
I don't think there should be any reason to be hiding information from other people or hide how you feel about somebody.

18
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:54,270
If there's any issues in the workplace. And, you know, that can also develop a trust.

19
00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:01,050
And I think it's important to also develop trust as well with people because I feel more comfortable coming to you for help or for advice or anything.

20
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:06,090
Great. Great. And why should we hire you over other evidence?

21
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:14,520
Well, as you may have seen in my resume, I attended the University of Michigan and I got my master's in industrial hygiene.

22
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:20,969
And as you may know, maybe not. This university is accredited and a lot of other universities are not accredited.

23
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:24,600
So I did receive my MPH from an accredited university,

24
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:31,860
which gives me a very good understanding and knows that I actually will be able to apply the knowledge that I have gained.

25
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:37,719
And also, I do plan on getting my CRH and my CSP plan.

26
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,680
I'm doing CSP first, but I do plan on doing certificates,

27
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:48,990
and I do think that would separate me from other applicants because I am going further with my knowledge and going after there to get my certificates.

28
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:58,860
As for other applicants, I feel as if that I have more knowledge than them in a certain extent with having a higher degree.

29
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,820
And I know some people may be coming in with a bachelor's as well.

30
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:10,230
So I think having that higher education will definitely trump me over other applicants.

31
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:12,360
Thank you.
