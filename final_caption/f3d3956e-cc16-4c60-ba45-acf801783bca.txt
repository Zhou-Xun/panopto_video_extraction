Hi. Congratulations to you being part of the FPHLP program.

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:12,250
And welcome to the session, basics of evaluation.

3
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:20,770
My name is Ebony Reddock. I am a Michigan graduate, Go Blue and a professional evaluator practicing in southeastern Michigan.

4
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:30,610
I have my own business Bumblebee Design and Evaluation, and I'm also an evaluation consultant at the Michigan Public Health Institute.

5
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:42,070
And I'm also a former flip mentor and instructor. So I hope that and I know that you will get a lot out of being in this program.

6
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:47,740
Today, I'll be providing you an introduction to evaluation research by the end of this session.

7
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:53,570
You should be able to identify what makes a research project an evaluation project.

8
00:00:53,570 --> 00:01:02,140
Describe the three different types of evaluation. Understand a basic evaluation process.

9
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:12,190
And while I'm providing a basic overview of evaluation, this is only the first step to having the skills to complete an evaluation project.

10
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:18,010
At the end of the session. I provide a few resources that include workbooks and further reading.

11
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:21,730
So let's get started.

12
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:35,380
We'll start with this section by answering the question, what is evaluation? Specifically what makes a research project an evaluation project?

13
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:39,730
The first thing you should know is that evaluation is research.

14
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:44,930
We use the same research methods as academic researchers or clinical researchers.

15
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:53,440
However, evaluation is distinguished by its purpose. Here I have two definitions of evaluation from two entities.

16
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:59,800
One, the CDC or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is likely familiar.

17
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:07,840
The other the American Evaluation Association is the US's National Professional Evaluation Association.

18
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,520
In both these definitions, I want to highlight certain terms.

19
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:17,530
The first two are systematic and examination.

20
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:26,290
Again, evaluation is a form of research. And so it is conducted using a plan or a planned approach.

21
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:33,800
The other three terms I highlight are merit, worth, and significance.

22
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:39,050
These three terms point to one distinguishable aspect of our work,

23
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:46,160
when we conduct evaluation, we are tuned into a programs merit, worth, and significance.

24
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,090
Merit is the absolute or relative quality of something.

25
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:58,940
saying I'm evaluating an after school program in which an organization anticipated a set of outcomes for the youth who participate.

26
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:07,040
If the youth experience these outcomes, I might say that the program has high merit because based on this universal standard

27
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:13,220
the program does what it was designed to do. It fulfilled its goals.

28
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:21,380
Worth is the value of the thing being evaluated or an evaluand in a particular context.

29
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:26,960
Now, somewhere else this program might be worthwhile because it is new to the community.

30
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:35,250
Let's say I learn in my work as an evaluator that the school has multiple after school programs just like this one.

31
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:42,150
It has merit, but I would say its worth is low because it is replicating existing services.

32
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:50,510
Significance, finally, is the value or meaning one ascribes to an evaluand. As I speak to youth and parents,

33
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:59,700
I learned that they feel more connected to this particular program because it was designed by long term community leaders in partnership with parents.

34
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:04,590
While it is replicating services, the buy in from the community is higher.

35
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:12,130
And thus I would say it has high significance or meaning in the school.

36
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:17,110
Evaluators also endorse for standards of our profession.

37
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:25,000
The ladder to propriety and accuracy are common to scholarly research as well. As an evaluator

38
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,990
I agree to conduct my work ethically and responsibly.

39
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:38,830
For example, I will not ask an interviewee to disclose immigration status, then pass a transcript to ICE. With accuracy

40
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:41,560
I will be systematic about my work.

41
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:53,410
I may need to change methods to accommodate my learnings, but I'm operating according to a rigorous system that is technically adequate.

42
00:04:53,410 --> 00:05:03,670
Utility and feasibility are two standards that are not as present and scholarly research processes, but are generally very important to evaluators.

43
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:10,810
Our work is conducted for someone, an 
 organization, a funder or community.

44
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:15,490
Because of that, we design projects in a way that will serve their needs.

45
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:24,190
For example, if I'm interested in the question about the program but it does not help my client implement an effective program,

46
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm unlikely to pursue it. With feasibility I'm attentive to the resources and approaches I use to conduct my evaluation.

47
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:42,910
If my budget, for example, is ten thousand dollars for a project I work hard to deliver the project within that budget.

48
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:50,830
If I think it will be really cool to observe a private board meeting, but stakeholders are resistant to move forward,

49
00:05:50,830 --> 00:06:01,330
I'm unlikely to continue convincing the client that I should be able to observe a board meeting.

50
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:10,000
This quote by Stephanie Evergreen, a data visualization expert, captures what makes evaluation unique.

51
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,230
"Evaluators are like researchers in that we seek to generate knowledge,

52
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:17,590
but we conduct our studies for real organizations

53
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:25,790
who are trying to learn whether they've made an impact with their work or whether new strategies can help them be more efficient."

54
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:29,150
To summarize, evaluation

55
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:38,330
research is a form of research that is concerned with understanding the merit, worth, and significance of a program or other evaluand.

56
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:52,060
In addition to propriety and accuracy, evaluators engage in work that is useful and feasible to its intended users.

57
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,520
That's it for the first segment.
