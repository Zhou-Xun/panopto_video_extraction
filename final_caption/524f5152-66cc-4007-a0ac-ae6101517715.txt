1
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:10,910
Back. Would somebody please check their computer and make sure I'm actually recording this?

2
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:25,700
I said I just signed up for recording so. It's in progress.

3
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:31,860
Wonderful. Thank you. That way, I don't have to come back down to Ann Arbor and rerecord.

4
00:00:31,860 --> 00:01:47,650
OK, we're going to get going in about a minute or two. Okay, we're going to get going in about a few seconds, but 20 seconds.

5
00:01:47,650 --> 00:02:07,500
OK. I like it for.

6
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:14,930
OK. This is virology part two. And so we're going to go on from what I started in the last lecture.

7
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:21,620
So as I said last time, viruses either have DNA or RNA, but not both.

8
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:28,490
OK, so we're going to talk about DNA viruses first, and the groups of viruses that are in DNA viruses are shown here.

9
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:35,990
The adenoviruses hepatitis B, but not hepatitis C, the herpes viruses shown here.

10
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:42,500
Herpes simplex one or two bear cell zoster and so on. People the viruses such as J.

11
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:52,280
S. indicate the power of A viruses, which include B 19 and then the pox viruses, which I hope we never see very Yola ever again.

12
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:59,300
But they still have stores frozen down in the Soviet Union and the United Nations.

13
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:10,100
Labs in Switzerland have stores of its frozen down if they ever need it for vaccines or anything else.

14
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:20,360
So coronavirus, as you can see, this is a much longer list of names astro viruses cause GI disease by viruses,

15
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:25,370
which includes arboviruses colitis contain norovirus coronaviruses.

16
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:28,470
We have heard a lot of them in the last year.

17
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:35,450
File filoviruses, which are you've heard of Ebola and probably Marburg, the flaviviruses which are West Nile and dengue.

18
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:40,670
We don't have dengue here. We do have West Nile here in Michigan with a mix of viruses, influenza.

19
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:44,300
Yes, we have that. Please continue to get your flu shots pyramid.

20
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:50,570
So viruses are very common. Influenza can imitate a common cold, or it can be much more serious.

21
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:58,100
But it also includes measles, mumps, first choice and every person's social virus, which is a huge pathogen in little kids.

22
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:09,180
The coronaviruses, which are enteroviruses, rotavirus, GI disease and the retroviruses, I'm sure you know that they are HIV, nht be.

23
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:16,740
Next slide. So we're going to talk about viruses affecting the respiratory tract first.

24
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:22,590
So these are awful mix of viruses. And as I said before, they include influenza viruses.

25
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:30,840
So if we just talk about influenza virus for for a moment, OK, so remember, I said viruses contain either RNA or DNA, but not both.

26
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:39,360
So, or the MCSO viruses contain influenza, in fact, contains enveloped RNA is an envelope RNA virus.

27
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,910
Its genome has seven to eight segments of the genome is not terribly large, but average form for a virus.

28
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:48,090
There are three types of influenza that most people know some know about.

29
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:53,610
Some don't certainly know about influenza A and influenza B in philosophy is quite rare.

30
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:56,160
We see it every once in a while, but not very often.

31
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:03,870
The disease due to influenza C is not any different from influenza A or B, and we just don't see it very often.

32
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:11,970
Influenza virus infects both humans and animals, so that's something to be aware of.

33
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:20,130
How is the disease transmitted? It's been transmitted, OK, coughing or breathing on someone else when you're infected.

34
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:24,210
These are small particles in the air. Assaults are less than 10 microns in size,

35
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:31,860
so it's very easy for them to get down into the lower parts of the lungs so they

36
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:36,240
can cause uncomplicated influenza where you're sick got a temperature of four,

37
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,820
three or four or five days, something like that. You feel horrible.

38
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:46,230
But after about six or seven days, you feel like you're going to live again can cause primary viral pneumonia,

39
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:51,030
which can be serious or not serious, depending on the person's health at the time that they get sick.

40
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:57,030
But with that viral pneumonia, you can always have a secondary infection with bacteria or other viruses.

41
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:04,920
And the secondary bacterial infection after influenza, particularly for a person who is old or immunocompromised, is very, very serious.

42
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:11,370
And there can be also shows your pulmonary complications and immunosuppressed patients.

43
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:18,420
So the symptoms of influenza a sudden onset, it hits you like this OK, fever,

44
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:22,710
cough, headache and muscle aches, or my allergies, nasal drainage and congestion?

45
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:30,870
That's influenza. And you have those symptoms for about, as I said, three or four days, and then you slowly start feeling better.

46
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:36,600
Resolution may take a week or more, depending on how well the person was when they got sick,

47
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:42,400
what their normal health is and how severe the illness was.

48
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,770
Next slide. So when do we see influenza viruses? November through April?

49
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:55,870
OK, so they're just now cranking up, but they have not had a big start this year yet.

50
00:06:55,870 --> 00:07:02,080
We have not seen much influenza this year. It has been a very quiet year for influenza, fortunately.

51
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:08,590
And they should start tapering off soon. I don't know whether it's.

52
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:17,620
Been the influenza virus just has not been as active this year, or whether with all of our vaccinations, more people have gotten influenza vaccine,

53
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:22,030
which will certainly help decrease the spread of the illness annually,

54
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:28,150
though in the United States is about 300000 people who are hospitalized with influenza every year.

55
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:33,430
And the deaths, certainly, as you might expect, are greater in elderly people.

56
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:38,980
About 90 percent of the 90 percent of the deaths are in elderly people older than MRSA.

57
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:45,070
But there's probably an average of twenty thousand or so deaths in an average year of influenza.

58
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:49,690
OK, economic losses are huge. $5 billion.

59
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:53,470
So now come the terms antigenic shift and antigenic drift.

60
00:07:53,470 --> 00:08:04,160
You know what? Those mean anybody. OK, antigenic drift means there's been a minor change in the viral genome,

61
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:10,850
and the vaccine might not work as well, or it might work depends on how much, how much of a change there was.

62
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:17,840
If there's an antigenic shift, it's a whole new virus and can cause global pandemics.

63
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:27,350
So you really do need to know the difference between antigenic drift and antigenic shift highlighted or underlying it.

64
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:36,290
What's the pathogenesis, OK? Influenza viruses break then causes death of the respiratory epithelial cells,

65
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:43,820
causes diffuse inflammation of the structures shown here the larynx, trachea and bronchi.

66
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:51,710
And with that diffuse inflammation and damage to those structures, you have a loss of natural defense mechanisms.

67
00:08:51,710 --> 00:09:00,840
So you may feel like you're coughing. A lot for the patient may feel like they're coughing a lot, but they're not effectively bringing up fluids.

68
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:10,790
So that's just one of the natural defense mechanisms that help to keep the the onslaught of influenza not quite as bad.

69
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:17,540
How is it diagnosed? Well, viral culture, if it's a brand new strain because of it's a brand new strain,

70
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:24,020
the molecular tests detected or may not may say it's a virus, but they don't can't tell you what it is.

71
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:33,550
It's a heme absorbing virus. So what does that mean? That means if you grow influenza virus in tissue culture.

72
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:44,530
Influenza virus doesn't make any doesn't kill cells when it's grown in tissue culture, but if you put red blood cells into that tissue culture,

73
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:51,010
the red blood cells will stick to the tissue culture cells that's called him adsorption.

74
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:58,570
OK. That's him adsorption, and that will help you determine whether or not there is an influenza virus present.

75
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:05,080
We can do allergen detection, but if it's a new strain, the antigen test may be negative.

76
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:09,880
And the same thing with the DFA depends on what kind of antibodies are in the DFAC.

77
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,880
If it's a new strain, they may or may not work.

78
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:19,840
So then we come down to the molecular assays, PCR and the other molecular assays, and those generally work better.

79
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:28,540
There certainly are more expensive. But if it's a brand new strain, you're going after whatever will work.

80
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:40,120
Next slide. So here's influenza. And it's a very nice picture in color, so you can certainly remember it so.

81
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:44,740
Heat exhaustion, nuclear absorption one, 215, one to nine.

82
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:57,520
So humid option taking on where you see the nuclear right there, there's the nurses and nuclear issue here as a human serving one.

83
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:03,880
So you can see there's a lot more spikes that will cause red blood cells to stick to the to the cell.

84
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:09,970
OK. Excuse me. It would cause red blood cells just to stick to the virus.

85
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:16,870
This is not actually the strain of the showing the strain of the virus, but they will stick to them.

86
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:24,760
So again, if a human subject can stick at least up to 15 viruses to a site.

87
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:29,230
Now I mentioned antigenic drift and antigenic shift.

88
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:39,580
Antigenic drift once again are minor changes in the heat exhaustion or nuclear nuclear absorption due to accumulation of mutations.

89
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:43,540
Things have changed, but not changed so much that you can't detect it.

90
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:47,770
You can detect it, but it's not quite right. You don't get quite the right answer.

91
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:52,730
OK, antigenic shift major changes. Your test won't work.

92
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:59,730
OK, if it's an antigen, a type of test.

93
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:11,520
OK, so this is a schematic published in the influenza viruses and influenza in 75, which is quite a while ago, but it's still true.

94
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:18,150
So here's disease incidence on the left hand side on the right side of the main population antibody level.

95
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:22,680
And you can see what if you introduce a new hypothetical virus?

96
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:31,590
You get a pandemic, OK, a lot of people are sick and then you go through this intercession whereby people are starting to make antibodies.

97
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:38,160
They're not as many sick, OK? And then the virus mutates a little bit, so it's got a little problem here.

98
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:45,360
You know, the epidemic, but it's the number of people sick or not as high as the number of people sick in the pandemic.

99
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,760
Then you have an intercession and then you get another little change here and you have some people sick,

100
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:58,560
but not as many from the epidemic or the pandemic. And that change keeps going on until the virus in my mind, which doesn't actually happen,

101
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:05,730
but in my mind says, OK, I'm going to get you now, I'm really changing. And then the pandemic level goes really high again.

102
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:11,260
OK. Next slide.

103
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:20,260
So let's talk about the viruses, so remember I said a pair of mix of viruses have a lot of respiratory disease.

104
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:26,050
So one of the paramedics so viruses is respiratory syncytial virus, who gets respiratory syncytial virus?

105
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:29,770
Little kids and it can be very serious.

106
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:34,480
And little kids, little babies, little toddlers can be very, very serious.

107
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:41,410
It is a single stranded RNA virus, has a helical capsid and an envelope.

108
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:45,370
What does that envelope and why is it? Why do I tell people has an envelope? They're slimy.

109
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:52,060
White blood cells can't get around it, OK? They protect the viral particles.

110
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:56,050
How is it transmitted? It's transmitted by droplet and contact.

111
00:13:56,050 --> 00:14:01,990
So with our mouth gone? But if I didn't have my mask on,

112
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:13,090
I'd be filling this room with particles from my respiratory tract or at least part of them who get sick with RSV or appear of excuse me.

113
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:19,000
Infants and children, by the time children are either four or six years old, but about six years old,

114
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:26,680
they start to start having serious disease with their mix of viruses because they've developed their immune responses.

115
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:32,200
How is it identified diagnosed? You can do a direct fluorescent antibody.

116
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:37,870
You can do culture. And here you look for in situ, which is the melding of two or three cells into really large cells.

117
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:44,650
And you can do molecular if it says PCR may not be an actual PCR type assay, but a molecular assay.

118
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:48,280
I skipped over epidemiology late fall to early spring,

119
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:55,730
and there's obviously nosocomial transmission because kids are not great at covering coughs and sneezes.

120
00:14:55,730 --> 00:15:02,240
Can it be treated with anything besides bed rest and lots of fluids? Yes, ribavirin for very serious cases.

121
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:08,390
In fact, a lot of the children who are hospitalized will be put on the virus. How is it prevented?

122
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:13,820
Well, we can tell people to cover their costs in their sneezes, but little kids are not great at doing that.

123
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:20,310
So you try and avoid contact with people who are ill, and I know that's very difficult to do.

124
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:27,890
It's very, very difficult to do. There is immunoglobulin available for immunocompromised people who may not be able

125
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:33,020
to get over this disease by themselves so that RSV immunoglobulin is available,

126
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:38,540
but patients should isolate. Certainly, if you have a sick child at home, they're not going to go out, play with their friends.

127
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:42,950
But mom and dad with a cough or cold, they're going to go to the grocery store, they're going to go to work and so on.

128
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:48,340
And so they may have a very mild RSV infection not knowing it.

129
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:54,170
So it's obviously as if they have a little colds. No big deal got transmitted to a lot of other people.

130
00:15:54,170 --> 00:16:00,350
So avoid contact, if possible, any time you have a respiratory illness.

131
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:04,580
And you all know what cohorting is. Everybody know what it is.

132
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,530
OK, well, somebody some people don't.

133
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:13,340
If you're in the hospital, you put two people with the same illness in the same room, so it saves better saves rooms.

134
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:29,510
OK. And the virus? Is a double stranded DNA virus, OK, has an icosahedron, capsid has no envelope to protect it.

135
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:34,490
And there are at least 50 human serotypes serotypes of infect humans.

136
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:40,610
So trying to develop a specific answer, a specific test for one serotype.

137
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:46,820
Not going to happen because there can be multiple serotypes being distributed at the same time.

138
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,740
How is it transmitted? Well,

139
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:57,460
respiratory fecal oral people who go to the bathroom and don't wash their hands or change diapers and don't wash their hands and then direct contact.

140
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:07,460
So if somebody's hands are contaminated and they rub their eyes because it itches, so that can be transmitted in that manner.

141
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:13,790
It can be late and also they can replicate in the oropharynx, in the throat, and people don't even know that it's there.

142
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:19,000
It has not exposed itself yet. So what is it cause?

143
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:25,850
It can cause respiratory illnesses, can cause gastroenteritis in kids and also for Ringo Conjunctiva fever,

144
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:31,220
because I told you about contaminating your I can grow there.

145
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:37,940
How do we diagnose it? Yes, DFA, if possible culture, but it will take several days.

146
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:46,610
There are areas enzyme immunoassays for gastroenteritis serotypes 40 and 41, which are the most common and no viruses that cause gastroenteritis.

147
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:52,370
So remember that had no virus serotypes 40 and 40 one of the most common?

148
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:59,750
What do we do for treatment? It's all supportive. There's no answer. There's no antivirals that work well,

149
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:10,190
but there is vaccine and it's use for military recruits and also for some young children who are who may be immunocompromised.

150
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:16,790
So when my older son was born with congenital heart disease, they asked us if we wanted this and we said yes.

151
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:25,540
I said yes, vaccine just to to to help him with in any way that we could.

152
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:42,520
Next slide. So here's an exam type question. Many viruses, including influenza A and influenza B, undergo antigenic drift through what mechanism?

153
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:50,130
Yes, you are correct, random mutation. Very good.

154
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:58,200
OK, next slide. Now we're going to talk about those lovely GI tract viruses that make you throw up.

155
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:07,490
OK, so the first one is real that are the real viruses and the one the most important one that you may have heard of are the road of viruses.

156
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:14,600
These are made of a segmented, double stranded DNA genome, so these are actually the double standard RNA genome.

157
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:20,120
They are the shape of an icosahedron capsid, and they have no envelope to protect them.

158
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:26,990
Transmission fecal oral, wash your hands, wash your hands and not just like this.

159
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:31,040
I did studies in my lab at this at Beaumont, and I said, OK,

160
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:37,850
we're going to see who can wash their hands correctly and the people who did it in 10 or 15 seconds lost.

161
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:43,070
It seems like a long time between 45 or 60 seconds, but it's really the most effective.

162
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:48,680
OK. This virus also will survive very well on inanimate surfaces.

163
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:54,590
So there's a reason we ask you to wipe everything down.

164
00:19:54,590 --> 00:20:01,670
What does it cause? It causes gastroenteritis in infants, and it's a lot of diarrhea, a lot of vomiting.

165
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:08,540
And this is in children six months to two years. And then it can also be seen in the elderly, particularly those in nursing homes.

166
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:13,340
Whether there may be transmission of a lot of diseases in nursing homes, how is it treated?

167
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:18,440
It's treated supportive, and one of the most important things that can happen is replacement of fluid.

168
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:23,450
So if a patient is vomiting and has diarrhea, they're losing a lot of fluid.

169
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:28,850
If they can't keep anything down, they may need an IV.

170
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:42,410
How do you prevent it? Avoid contact hand-washing and that there is vaccine in underdeveloped countries, but it's not used in the United States.

171
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:42,980
Next slide.

172
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:51,860
So now we come to the cold viruses and this is our friend, Norwalk, how many of you have had a Norwalk or suspect Norwalk infection anybody?

173
00:20:51,860 --> 00:21:02,480
Yeah, me too. It's not pleasant. So, yeah, it's made of single stranded RNA in the genome as an icosahedron capsid and there's no envelope.

174
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,720
How is it transmitted fecal oral? Wash your hands really well.

175
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,660
I think if you want to know how long to wash your hands, I always hope that somebody told you wash it.

176
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:16,760
The length of singing the Happy Birthday song twice at normal speed, not rapidly.

177
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:21,230
That's how long you need to wash your hands. What is it causes?

178
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:27,830
Cause norovirus causes vomiting, nausea and diarrhea, and anybody who's ever had this will say yes.

179
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:32,210
I wash my hands very well. No, it's not pleasant.

180
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:39,680
How is it diagnosed? You can pick up the virus with electron microscopy, but I have to tell you, most clinical labs don't use electron microscopy.

181
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:43,250
It's very expensive and time consuming. There are molecular assays.

182
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:49,370
They were very, very well because if you're doing a molecular assay for a viral diarrhea,

183
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:54,680
you're going to try and take up all the viral, almost all viral diarrheal agents at one time.

184
00:21:54,680 --> 00:22:00,620
They're all also EIA tests, but they're not as effective as the molecular PCR.

185
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:09,350
How is it treated? But it's supportive. Know if a person has virulent diarrhea and vomiting, they may need an I.V. replacement of fluid.

186
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:17,690
If the person can start taking small sips of water or seven up something like that spacing out and they don't start making them sick,

187
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:25,430
then they can increase the size of the ship, slowly, increase the frequency of the soap, trying to get fluids back into them.

188
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:26,330
How is it prevented?

189
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:34,730
Avoid contact and that's that's easier said than done because the virus can be shed for at least seven days after a person is clinical well.

190
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:42,580
So it's very difficult to avoid contact. However, the masks will help.

191
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:48,860
Next, slide the coronaviruses. These are small viruses, they contain RNA, not DNA.

192
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:54,400
They're single stranded. They have an icosahedron capsid and they're not indolent.

193
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,060
So what's the most important group of what is three important groups shown here?

194
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:07,660
Enterovirus is there over 70 different types of internal viruses, and that includes polio virus, coxsackievirus, eco viruses and enteroviruses.

195
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:13,030
Every year, here in Michigan and across the United States, we see outbreaks of enterovirus.

196
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:17,530
And there are different animal viruses, but we see them. It's very common.

197
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:25,480
We do see some Cox. Actually, we do see a few echoes, but polio. Fortunately, it's pretty much gone from the United States now.

198
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:35,320
It's still there. If a person went swimming in an area where the water in the stream was getting a lot of fecal material in it,

199
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:41,230
you could still potentially pick up the virus. But if the person is vaccinated, they'll be fine.

200
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:50,170
Okay. The problems exist in other countries where they don't have as extensive vaccination policies as we do here in the United States.

201
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:58,990
So after the enteroviruses, we had hepatitis A and rhinovirus, rhinovirus is the common cold,

202
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:03,160
and we see a lot of that every year, we don't try and diagnose it. We know what it is.

203
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:08,140
Hepatitis A is similar to hepatitis B, except because there are different types of viruses.

204
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:17,580
One is RNA, one is DNA and so on. OK, so more on enteroviruses, how are they transmitted fecal oral transmission?

205
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:26,160
Wash your hands, make sure everybody washes their hands and for the rest of the length of the Happy Birthday song twice.

206
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:40,260
OK. Polio viruses can cause aseptic meningitis, and neonatal sepsis can also cause paralysis.

207
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:45,420
So if a person is not vaccinated for polio,

208
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:51,720
the chances are that they could still go traveling in other countries, particularly, they maybe pick it up.

209
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:56,400
But polio vaccination is pretty much standard in the United States now.

210
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:02,880
How is it detected? The virus detected? We can do culture, but it takes days. We can do molecular and we can get it done the same day.

211
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:14,860
And as I said, vaccine for polio viruses, it's about three shots over time and then a booster periodically, but it works very, very well.

212
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:23,950
OK, so this is this picture, I've saved it, David Shinseki is a great author.

213
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:31,990
He wrote a book called Polio An American Story. I have that book at home and these are the participants in the 1954 polio vaccine trial.

214
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:39,540
They wanted to be included in it. So bad you could see the lines lined up to get vaccinated with a shot.

215
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:43,540
A little kid, you can see getting vaccinated. I'm old, OK?

216
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:52,960
I grew up in northeast Nebraska. I remember when oral polio vaccine came in in my hometown of Norfolk, Nebraska, was a city auditorium.

217
00:25:52,960 --> 00:26:04,000
The line to get the oral polio vaccine wound around inside and around the building twice just to get that sugar cane with the oral polio vaccine.

218
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,590
It works very, very well. Well, I hope we never have to see polio anywhere in the world.

219
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:16,740
I know it's still in some countries, but hopefully someday it will be eradicated.

220
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:25,680
And if you've never been to CDC, I hope everyone here gets a chance to go to the CDC in Atlanta and go through their museum.

221
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:32,970
It is absolutely. I don't even have words for when you first stand in front of an iron lung and

222
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:37,770
you're thinking about people who are encased in that for the rest of their lives.

223
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:40,170
They could not eat for themselves, they could not drink for themselves.

224
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:48,270
And somebody had to change their diapers and they could not move depending on how high up to the paralysis went.

225
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:52,410
And you look at that and it still gives me goose bumps, you think?

226
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:57,030
Thank heavens for science. Thank heavens for what we have been able to accomplish.

227
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:59,680
And if you can see in the background, you can see rows of them.

228
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:11,960
This is an actual picture of where patients were being put into our lung, so they would not die immediately because they couldn't breathe.

229
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:25,100
OK. On the hepatitis C, transmitted fecal oral has a hepatitis with a shorter incubation period, has an abrupt onset, low mortality,

230
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:32,990
no carrier status diagnosed by serology there, I'm sure pretty sure I know there are molecular tests for right now.

231
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:39,440
Also, how is it prevented vaccine? And if a person get sick with hepatitis A, there are.

232
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:46,520
There is immunoglobulin that can be used to treat that person. Now, not every hospital has that immunoglobulin.

233
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:52,160
But hospitals are very good with check in with colleagues sharing with public health,

234
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:58,940
checking with CDC to see who has vaccines and immunoglobulins that can help them out.

235
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:11,240
They've got an outbreak. OK, now arboviruses and other blood borne viruses.

236
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:16,190
OK, so these are flaviviruses, I think that's pretty name flaviviruses.

237
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:23,870
It's a single stranded RNA virus that's spherical and has an icosahedron capsid, and it has an envelope around it.

238
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:30,770
So it's harder for the white blood cells to kill which viruses are flaviviruses that's shown here on the fly.

239
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:37,370
We've got yellow fever, dengue, West Nile, Japanese encephalitis and St. Louis encephalitis.

240
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:42,560
What do we see here in Michigan? We see a few cases of St. Louis every year.

241
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:51,200
We definitely see West Nile. Fortunately, the only time we see the other's if somebody has traveled to an area where they are endemic.

242
00:28:51,200 --> 00:29:00,830
How are they transmitted? Mosquitoes diagnose mosquitoes and other arthropods can certainly transmit them both most common mosquitoes.

243
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:07,410
What do they cause? They cause encephalitis, dengue fever and yellow yellow fever.

244
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:11,100
How is it diagnosed serology either on cerebrospinal fluid?

245
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:21,560
And there are molecular tests now for almost everything. But soon they can diagnose West Nile with a molecular test also.

246
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:27,320
And when you're out working, if you don't know what tests are available in your lab doesn't know if something's available.

247
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:34,370
You always call your public health lab, they will know what's available. OK.

248
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:42,200
Hepatitis C is a flavivirus. How is it transmitted parenteral or sexual transmission?

249
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:47,150
What is the cause that causes hepatitis and that hepatitis can be acute or chronic?

250
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:53,060
And something to remember that chronic hepatitis can lead to liver cancer?

251
00:29:53,060 --> 00:30:00,200
Nothing that you would ever wish on anyone. How is it diagnosed, molecular or serology?

252
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:07,070
How is it managed? You can do a viral load and see how much virus the person has.

253
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:15,830
All you need specialized labs is a viral load. You can do genotyping to see if it's a strain of hepatitis C that could be treated.

254
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:23,180
And if you're going to do treatment, might be interferon and ribavirin at the same time.

255
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:29,870
And there are other directly acting antivirals that are coming on the market.

256
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:38,450
But certainly, interferon and rhinovirus together would work.

257
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:47,090
So here's an illustration of the time course of the immune response and disease due to hepatitis C virus.

258
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:53,420
You can see here is relative concentration and on the bottom is the time.

259
00:30:53,420 --> 00:31:01,670
So in the study weeks, the alti patients, the which is a liver enzyme goes up, got acute disease.

260
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:07,550
And then as over the months, your body starts making antibodies,

261
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:19,540
which can be detected by enzyme immunoassay in the lab or your use may not be able to do this, but public health can detect viral DNA by PCR.

262
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:27,970
So as time goes on, the relative concentration goes down, but it might pick up and then go down and pick up and then go down and pick up.

263
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:35,470
This can go on for decades. And if it peaks up high enough, person can get a relapse and then we go back down again.

264
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:41,680
And so what? You want to treat it, what you want to look for and not treat but look for is alanine aminotransferase here,

265
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:51,240
which is a measurement of how much your body is reacting to the viral disease.

266
00:31:51,240 --> 00:32:00,050
And this is I said, this is hepatitis C. OK, so now we have adenoviruses, I don't know who comes up with these names, but I've had no bias.

267
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:02,900
This is hepatitis B virus.

268
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:13,310
You think that at least have a B in the had something a double stranded DNA virus and an icosahedron capsid capsule with an envelope,

269
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:21,320
so it's harder to kill? We can't really say kill because viruses are not alive, except when they're in the cells, but it's harder to get rid of them.

270
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:28,500
How is it transmitted exposure to blood and body fluids? So, like I say, I'm old.

271
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:35,640
I remember the days in the hospital labs or the public health labs where we didn't always wear gloves.

272
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:39,180
And then when this came out about hepatitis B and there was a large outbreak,

273
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:44,370
one year old actually got to start wearing gloves and then gloves became short supply.

274
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:55,380
But we made it through so always gloves. Whenever you're handling any body fluid, any blood, any specimen collecting specimens to send about gloves.

275
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:56,730
What is the what do they have had?

276
00:32:56,730 --> 00:33:08,580
No viruses cause acute hepatitis, and about 90 percent of them will resolve chronic hepatitis with resolution about only about nine percent.

277
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:15,330
But then with hepatitis B, you can have a chronic carrier state and you may or may not have active disease.

278
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:19,410
Sometimes you have it, sometimes you don't have it. This can lead to liver cancer.

279
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:25,270
This is devastating. So how do we detect it strategy?

280
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:30,820
This person has antibodies or edge and detection, and there are molecular assays now.

281
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:40,180
How is it prevented? Hepatitis B vaccine? And if a person is exposed it, maybe they cut their finger while they're working on specimens in the lab.

282
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:50,910
There is hepatitis B immune globulin. Hand in hand here have had to have closed the vaccine besides me.

283
00:33:50,910 --> 00:34:04,000
Good, good. Look, here's an illustration of a time course of an anemia and immune response in a patient who recovered from hepatitis B infection.

284
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,820
OK, you can see hepatitis B surface antigen is is detected.

285
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:12,660
Somewhere between incubation is four to 12 weeks, acute infection at two to 12 weeks.

286
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:21,660
So you don't really know where this starts. But somewhere in the middle of that, you can detect the antigen and the dashed line is the antibody.

287
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:33,690
And you can see that a few sometime after antigen is detected or is formed, you start by start making A. Hepatitis B, and that's the antibody.

288
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:42,450
And then eventually the hepatitis B antigen goes down and we've got all this anti hepatitis B surface or chlorine antigen.

289
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:47,610
And here we come up with hepatitis B surface antigen, so recovery can take years.

290
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:54,030
The acute disease can be two weeks can be up to 16 weeks, four months of acute disease.

291
00:34:54,030 --> 00:35:10,820
It all depends on how good the patient's immune responses are. OK, here are the serologic profiles following a typical hepatitis B virus infection.

292
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:17,900
So you can have a negative surface antigen A. Surface antigen engine antibodies in and a hepatitis B core.

293
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:24,680
OK, so if it's no, there's been no exposure or very early in the exposure time period,

294
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:31,760
so there is no antibody to the antibody takes at least a couple of weeks, if not longer.

295
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:39,980
If hepatitis B surface antigen is positive, you may get enough titers B antigen detected.

296
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:50,610
But this would just indicate early hepatitis B infection. If you detect hepatitis B and help the tightest B core antibody,

297
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:55,310
it means the patient has been infected and the body is making antibody, which is good.

298
00:35:55,310 --> 00:36:05,630
OK, so if you still got hepatitis B surface antigen positive, you don't have any any anti hepatitis B surface standard,

299
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:13,640
no hepatitis B antigen, but you have A. Hepatitis B antigen and A. Hepatitis B core.

300
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:16,700
And what this probably means is you've got a chronic carrier.

301
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:25,680
Your patient is a chronic carrier, hepatitis B. That's not good, OK, because you're going to have to take precautions for a long time.

302
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:33,860
So if you go on here and everything is negative until the patient has A. Hepatitis B antigen and A. Hepatitis B core is,

303
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:42,500
of course A. Means it's antibodies to them. So this is the early recovery phase from early from acute hepatitis B next to the bottom.

304
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:53,180
If you have have A. Hepatitis B, surface antigen and then A. Hepatitis B and A. Hepatitis B patient has recovered from hepatitis B with immunity.

305
00:36:53,180 --> 00:37:00,020
And then finally, if they just have A. Hepatitis B surface antigen and nothing else is positive,

306
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:07,130
there was a distant infection sometime in the past along with in the past, or they've had the hepatitis B vaccine.

307
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:14,540
How many of you in here have had hepatitis B vaccine antibody? When you go to work in hospitals, you will be getting, um yeah, I've had all the shots.

308
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:18,950
Also hepatitis B surface antigen antigen vaccine.

309
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:30,470
Excuse me? OK. I remember a time we talked before HIV, so human immunodeficiency virus.

310
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:39,590
It is a retrovirus, OK? There are two theologically distinct viruses.

311
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:44,510
They are geographically distinct, also hepatitis or HIV one and HIV two.

312
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:52,010
OK, so those two viruses in that group, they have similar epidemiologic characteristics, but no.

313
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:56,820
Two HIV two is less pathogenic than HIV one.

314
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:01,440
OK. High risk groups, you probably already know this.

315
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:11,520
Men who have sex with men, IV drug abusers, people who sell sex for drugs because they're getting it on with anybody that they can to get the drugs.

316
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:18,360
And there are increasing rates in other demographics. So this is not going away.

317
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:23,700
HIV one is worldwide, HIV two is only in West Africa.

318
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:30,630
Now we have seen it in the United States by people who travel here or come here for school or they're here visiting relatives or something,

319
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:42,740
but it's not generally being transmitted here. And if it is being transmitted, the numbers are very, very low.

320
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:53,300
OK. What does it do? It infects T cells, so I assume everybody here has taken an immunology class.

321
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:56,210
We have T cells and we have these cells in our bodies.

322
00:38:56,210 --> 00:39:04,760
B cells make antibody with the help of T cells, and T cells are your cellular immunity plus helping with antibody production?

323
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:11,420
And so the virus targets CD4 molecule on the helper T cell.

324
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:18,190
So it really limits the helper T cells from helping the other cells do the work.

325
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:25,210
So what happens when a patient's infected, it results in destruction of the C four cells,

326
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:31,510
and that means immunosuppression because CD4 cells can't respond.

327
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:37,000
It means opportunistic infections increase greatly as the CD4 count goes down,

328
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:44,410
opportunistic opportunistic infections go up and there's a wide variety of other opportunistic infections could be Pneumocystis,

329
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:57,040
PCP, Saramago, Epstein-Barr, Kaposi's or even someone who was infected with MTB took some medication for the number three months, six months.

330
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:05,470
And so they're fine that that bacterium is probably still in their body, but it's being increased and the white blood cells are keeping in line.

331
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:09,010
HIV comes long. Boom, white cells are not doing their job.

332
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:14,560
The TB can break out. OK, so there's a lot of other things like that that can happen.

333
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:24,550
There is antiretroviral therapy and prophylaxis for opportunistic infections that people get before they've had their full course of therapy.

334
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:28,870
So but these patients need to be monitored. And how do you monitor them?

335
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:35,950
You look at their viral load. So certainly the public health labs in the labs and the large institutions can do viral load testing.

336
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:46,370
You can even argue labs can look at the ratio of CD4 cells to create cells, and there is resistance testing for the virus.

337
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:54,140
And let me tell you, when I talk about the reference labs and all, if you're working in a hospital that doesn't have a large, not a large hospital,

338
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:58,070
your laboratory and your hospital may not be able to do a lot of what I'm talking about today,

339
00:40:58,070 --> 00:41:07,700
but they certainly have links with the state public health lab with other large hospital labs or large commercial labs like LabCorp or even Mayo.

340
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:14,670
OK, so testing is available. So let's talk about the virus.

341
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:23,310
Human T cell lymphoma, trophic level, tropic virus, HIV, it's also a retrovirus.

342
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:28,770
OK. There are two types of HIV one and two.

343
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:35,580
There's the theologically and geographically distant say it'll be one an inch or two to be.

344
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:44,700
One is in southern Japan, the Caribbean islands, Melanesia, sub-Saharan Africa and Central and South America.

345
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:54,120
And in those areas, the prevalence is five to 27 percent in adults, so a quarter of the population could be infected.

346
00:41:54,120 --> 00:42:00,120
Those are overwhelming numbers for age 12, one age to other.

347
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:09,690
I'll be two can be has been documented in Native Americans, pygmy tribes in Central and Kimmi tribes in central Africa.

348
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:13,560
And there the prevalence overall is seven to nine percent.

349
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:21,660
So certainly not the prevalence that HIV has, but a significant prevalence in the United States.

350
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:28,440
We have a large population of intravenous drug abusers, and prostitutes oftentimes just go together, not always.

351
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:33,900
And the prevalence of HIV is anywhere from seven to 49 percent.

352
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:48,430
So yes, it is being transmitted in the United States also. So for what are there, what are they to be a sense, associated diseases?

353
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:56,830
Nearly all infected people remain asymptomatic. They don't know that they've been infected, but one to four percent will present with some disease.

354
00:42:56,830 --> 00:43:04,210
That might be adult T-cell leukemia. And certainly any kind of cancer is very serious.

355
00:43:04,210 --> 00:43:09,850
There can be H-2B associated my allopathy or tropical spastic paresis.

356
00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:15,380
It's oftentimes misdiagnosed as multiple sclerosis because the symptoms are very,

357
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:23,690
very much the same, but that the lab doctor can order testing to see what is causing this.

358
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:29,960
OK. The mean onset is about 40 years post-infection.

359
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:33,350
So sometimes I don't remember what I did yesterday, the day before, 40 years ago.

360
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:38,300
No, no, I don't know anybody who would remember what they did 40 years ago even.

361
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:44,810
And so most of you are younger, so you can't think back that far. It can be transmitted through transfusions.

362
00:43:44,810 --> 00:44:00,220
So the Blood Red Cross and other blood supply organizations are testing for healthy and positive people are deferred from donations.

363
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:05,770
And once you test is positive, it goes on your chart. It's one of those, it's like your immunization record.

364
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:09,700
Anybody can look at it practically, OK?

365
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:16,450
Testing for HIV and AIDS TB the same types of methods are used to detect both.

366
00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:21,010
You can do direct detection of virus, but remember you have to have the right cell line.

367
00:44:21,010 --> 00:44:24,970
The cells can't be too old. It's very expensive and it takes time.

368
00:44:24,970 --> 00:44:32,470
You can look for viral antigen or you can look for a viral nucleic acid, and neither are qualitative tests or quantitative tests.

369
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:39,010
And the quantitative test is the one that we call the viral load. We can do viral load testing for a lot of different viruses.

370
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:53,000
Certainly, we do it for HIV and TB. So we need to detect the laboratory's need to be able to detect products of antiviral immune response.

371
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:59,510
So if a patient is infected with one of these viruses, are they making antibodies or are there?

372
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:03,140
There are white blood cells active against this virus.

373
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:10,160
And so you can do screening testing by enzyme immunoassay and you can do confirmatory testing by western blot.

374
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:20,180
Much of this is done in public health labs and by the Red Cross because all blood is tested before it can be used.

375
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:37,160
OK. Exam type question. Yellow fever, dengue, West Nile, Japanese encephalitis and St. Louis encephalitis are all transmitted by what ABC or de.

376
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:44,380
B, yes, you are correct. Now, we're not done yet.

377
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:48,740
We've got to talk about herpes. OK.

378
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:53,030
Herpes viruses, double stranded DNA viruses. OK.

379
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:57,020
Certainly, I think that I when I think about double standard DNA, I always think about herpes.

380
00:45:57,020 --> 00:46:03,150
Is it not an icosahedron capsid? It's got it. It's envelope and it's there eight different types of this envelope.

381
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:11,030
OK, so eight different types of viruses transmitted direct contact with secretions.

382
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:18,590
It can become latent in a variety of different tissues. People will not know that they were infected until something else comes along to

383
00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:23,870
reduce their immune response and how perhaps this virus so it can be infected.

384
00:46:23,870 --> 00:46:31,190
The infection can be hidden in nerve ganglia, and this certainly happens with herpes simplex virus and varicella zoster.

385
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:41,570
Epstein-Barr can hide in B cells, and cytomegalovirus can hide in white blood cells, endothelial cells and a variety of other different organs.

386
00:46:41,570 --> 00:46:51,880
And these are all herpes viruses. So certainly herpes simplex is the most common one, has a lot of different disease types,

387
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:57,640
it can infect oral and genital mucosa that can cause encephalitis in adults.

388
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:05,260
And here it is Herpes simplex type one that can cause encephalitis in adults, and it can cause disseminated disease in neonates.

389
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:11,890
And that can be herpes simplex one or two. And yes, any disease in neonates is devastating.

390
00:47:11,890 --> 00:47:17,080
This, I think, goes further than devastating. How do we detect it?

391
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:20,260
We can do a skin scraping the lesion and do a DFA on it.

392
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:25,450
And if the viral if there are enough cells infected and we got a good specimen, we can pick it up.

393
00:47:25,450 --> 00:47:28,960
We can do culture or do molecular.

394
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:35,680
And I shouldn't always be saying PCR because there's a lot of different tests that are not PCR, but it's a molecular assay.

395
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:42,520
Was it treated a cycle before? Then we have herpes.

396
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:45,610
Excuse me, varicella zoster virus.

397
00:47:45,610 --> 00:47:55,720
What is it called chicken pox, which is the acute form of their cells, Oster and then shingles, which is the reactivation form of varicella zoster?

398
00:47:55,720 --> 00:48:01,060
How many of you have had chickenpox? Anybody know couple?

399
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:07,750
My older sister and I shared a bedroom growing up until we fought so much that they built up the house.

400
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:11,380
But she got covered with chicken pox.

401
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:18,120
I think a pox on my body. Wasn't fair, is she's the physician also now.

402
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:25,350
OK, so how is it detected? We can do a in the lesion, but once again you got to get a good specimen into the laboratory.

403
00:48:25,350 --> 00:48:33,870
The lab has to have the reagents and so on. We can do culture. And if a lab is still doing viral cultures, herpes another herpes viruses,

404
00:48:33,870 --> 00:48:39,930
which and their cells actually grow fairly fast, but you can't you don't always get a good specimen.

405
00:48:39,930 --> 00:48:44,340
You don't know that we can do PCR or another molecular assay.

406
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:51,330
Was it treated with acyclovir? And so there's plenty of sites of error and modifications of a cycle out in the market.

407
00:48:51,330 --> 00:49:01,620
How is it prevented vaccines? Other vaccines prevent primary and reactivation.

408
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:11,280
Then we have Epstein-Barr virus. OK, so the disease is caused by Epstein-Barr infectious mono, anybody in here had infectious mono.

409
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:15,240
My sister had an infectious smile growing up progressive multifocal lymph,

410
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:20,970
a prolific proliferative disease called partly because it's so hard to see the rest of it.

411
00:49:20,970 --> 00:49:25,890
It's lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. How is it diagnosed?

412
00:49:25,890 --> 00:49:36,750
Serology, but in this day and age, molecular. And if you're doing serology, you look for a modest about test looking for a head or a file antibody.

413
00:49:36,750 --> 00:49:48,190
OK, but in this day and age, most people with acute Epstein-Barr positional order molecular and that will detect it.

414
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:56,590
OK, another DNA virus, so legal middle-class person to be infected and not know that they were infected.

415
00:49:56,590 --> 00:50:05,830
It also causes a variety of different illnesses. Most serious is, well, the two most serious congenital infection of the newborn,

416
00:50:05,830 --> 00:50:14,470
which is we look for that all the time of new newborns in the in the hospital disseminated disease in immunocompromised patients.

417
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:20,800
Any patient who's immuno compromised, depending on the type of immuno composite compromising disease,

418
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:26,290
could have this, and cytomegalovirus can be very difficult.

419
00:50:26,290 --> 00:50:32,380
And it also causes Countryfile negative mononucleosis. So how is it diagnosed serology?

420
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:35,440
We've had serology for cytomegalovirus for a long time.

421
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:41,380
But in this day and age, as I keep saying over and over, most people will order a molecular test.

422
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:45,970
How do we prevent cytomegalovirus? Well,

423
00:50:45,970 --> 00:50:51,670
one of the most important prevention than the one that I've got here is you have to check blood or tissue

424
00:50:51,670 --> 00:50:58,720
before it's transfused or transplanted to make sure that it's sero negative for cytomegalovirus because

425
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:04,960
you would not like to either do a transplant or a transfusion and then find out afterwards while the

426
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:11,450
patient is being immuno compromised so that he doesn't read he or she doesn't reject the transfusion.

427
00:51:11,450 --> 00:51:22,630
Oh, well, that transfusion actually had a caveat. OK, so those things are tread very standard to check it.

428
00:51:22,630 --> 00:51:34,730
OK. Other viruses of clinical importance. Human papillomavirus, this is a popover virus.

429
00:51:34,730 --> 00:51:43,700
It is double stranded, DNA has double stranded DNA has an icosahedron, icosahedron, capsid and no envelope.

430
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:52,100
Anybody here not heard of HPV, it's pretty common. More than 200 different types of human papillomavirus.

431
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:56,570
How is it transmitted through direct contact? OK, diseases?

432
00:51:56,570 --> 00:51:59,760
What does it cause? Skin and genital warts.

433
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:07,340
And these are generally when they show off are these are the low risk genotypes, not the high risk genotype that are most likely to lead to cancer.

434
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:10,740
So it can also cause cervical or penile cancer.

435
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:20,780
And here we have the high risk genotypes, particularly genotypes 16 and 18, that are really associated with this type of cancer.

436
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:27,730
Detected with molecular assays. They can either be hybridization or an amplification assay.

437
00:52:27,730 --> 00:52:30,730
How is it prevented vaccine?

438
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:44,620
There is some therapy with antivirals, some antiviral therapy does not work that well, but there is some antiviral therapy for this.

439
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:50,560
Next light. OK, ratings. So this is a Abdul virus.

440
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:56,290
It is a single stranded RNA virus, but the hilldale capsid has an envelope, so it's difficult,

441
00:52:56,290 --> 00:53:03,340
more difficult for antibodies and white blood cells to case, and the virus itself has bullet shaped.

442
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:12,310
How does a person get it bites from a rabid animal? However, 20 percent of the human cases have no known exposure,

443
00:53:12,310 --> 00:53:18,730
and I will tell you something that I read in the newspaper probably about a month ago that in mid-Michigan,

444
00:53:18,730 --> 00:53:27,070
there is a very, very high in southeast Michigan, also very, very high rate of rabies and skunks.

445
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:31,180
So just be aware of that, I mean, nobody wants to be around a skunk for obvious reasons.

446
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:35,770
But they also have a very high rate of rabies this year.

447
00:53:35,770 --> 00:53:43,990
How is it detected for us, an antibody for swell or PCR, which is done much more rapidly and can tell you if it's positive?

448
00:53:43,990 --> 00:53:50,500
How is it prevented vaccination? So anybody who works with animals in a zoo or veterinarian in an office,

449
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:58,660
etc. will be vaccinated, OK, if they get bit scratched, anything post-exposure immunoglobulin?

450
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:03,830
And if your health department doesn't have it, CDC will send it overnight. That's how important this is.

451
00:54:03,830 --> 00:54:12,690
It is a horrible disease and rapidly fatal.

452
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:22,030
And they are trying to increase the number of people who are vaccinated, but it has not gone across the entire United States yet.

453
00:54:22,030 --> 00:54:27,760
So obviously, if you like to camp out and you see a cute little animal and you want to pet it, don't.

454
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:32,590
OK? OK. Exam type question.

455
00:54:32,590 --> 00:54:37,750
This member of the herpes family is vaccine preventable.

456
00:54:37,750 --> 00:54:44,020
Latent in nerve ganglia and reactivation of it leads to shingles.

457
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:56,450
ABC or DD? Yes. Singles.

458
00:54:56,450 --> 00:55:06,800
OK. That's the end. Any questions?

459
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:13,100
No questions. OK, we have a test on Monday. I'm going through reviewing it right now.

460
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:20,270
I know I said that we would get your test back today, however. I'm getting rid of questions that a lot of people missed.

461
00:55:20,270 --> 00:55:27,160
So it's to your advantage. You'll get it back on Monday. OK.

462
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:34,660
You know, what's going to be on the test where you don't need to exact questions, but you know the topics it since the last test?

463
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:44,010
Anything else we need to discuss? OK, I will see you on Monday.

464
00:55:44,010 --> 00:55:50,939
Pencils in hand.
