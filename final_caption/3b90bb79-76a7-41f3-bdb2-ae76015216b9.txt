1
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:16,580
OK, we're going to get going now. I have actually put two lectures together sequentially for today.

2
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:20,480
The first one is on urinary tract infections, genital, urinary and so on.

3
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:27,410
And then because it's difficult to attach a second lecture to to canvas, I just attached it to the end of this one.

4
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:38,610
And that'll work fine. And so I think on Monday on our talk a little bit about MRSA, but it'll be it'll be a short lecture.

5
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:43,430
So urinary tract infections are very, very common.

6
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:48,140
Some general considerations, and one is the anatomy.

7
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:56,330
They can involve the upper kidneys. They can involve the orders they can have on the upper side.

8
00:00:56,330 --> 00:01:04,710
On the lower side, they can involve the bladder and the urethra. And is this a duplicate?

9
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:15,070
Yeah, I think put 20. OK, what's on Slide 20?

10
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:22,160
I have to say. OK.

11
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:26,950
I have to know what's on it, because I can't. This is the start of skin, soft skin and soft tissue.

12
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:47,220
OK, good. Tell me when I get there, OK?

13
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:52,320
Now they are OK skin and soft tissue. Exactly. OK.

14
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:59,640
And wound infection, so general considerations, you need to know the anatomy of the skin and it's I think it's on the next slide.

15
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,930
The function of the skin is defense. It protects the body.

16
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:12,690
It's our own little army on the outside of us. It regulates body temperature, the evaporation of water and how metabolites are used.

17
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:19,570
So there's a huge number of reasons why we need to take care of the skin.

18
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:29,950
The incidence of infections of the skin, the etiologic agents and the pathogenesis are all important when we consider skin infections.

19
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:37,390
So it's not just one organism as though it's the big picture. Lots and lots of different organisms can cause infections of the skin.

20
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:48,380
It's not just staff and strep or anything like that. So figure sixty three point one, six three, Dash one, so this is a diagram of skin.

21
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:57,860
And you can see on the outside, we have a hair, the strand of hair goes all the way down to the hair follicle at the bottom.

22
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:04,970
We have a sweat gland. This tangled up tubular structure that goes all the way to the skin also.

23
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:11,810
And then we have a sebaceous gland that intersects with the hair follicle.

24
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:24,080
And you can see it's broken down into epidermis, dermis, subcutaneous tissues and then fashion and muscle going all the way down as deep as you can.

25
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:34,720
So. Infection of skin is infections in around hair follicles, because we have hair almost almost all the way on the surface of our body.

26
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:41,140
These infections can be called folliculitis for wrinkles or carbon holes.

27
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:48,490
And the difference in these terms is how big the lesion is, how big the infection is in the most serious is a carbuncle.

28
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:53,410
OK. They can be caused by staph aureus very commonly.

29
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:56,290
Any of the Turks.

30
00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:04,000
And if you go swimming a lot, you can get a skin infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa from the swimming pools or if you happen to soak in a hot tub,

31
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,610
which sounds pretty good most days. And it's the hot tub is not cleaned adequately.

32
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:14,380
You can get an infection if you scrape your skin while you're in that hot tub,

33
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:20,890
so there can also be infections of the keratin ice layer of the epidermis that's a little bit further down.

34
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:25,940
And these are generally due to demand from fungi. OK.

35
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:29,930
And we know who the dramatic fights are. Mike was born and so on.

36
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:36,710
OK. And then we can have infections of the deep dermis, deep epidermis and the dermis.

37
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:45,020
And these occur because traumatic inoculation a wound, OK, something goes down and carries organisms and anything else.

38
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:52,640
So erysipelas is an infection of the dermis and superficial subcutaneous areas.

39
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:57,410
And I don't know if you've ever seen a patient or a picture of someone who has syphilis.

40
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:05,000
But these are very painful red indicated lesions, and there may also be infected with Group Strep.

41
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:12,740
OK, so it's like a double whammy. Then there's cellulitis, and this is more serious than erysipelas.

42
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:18,170
And this is a diffuse spreading infection of the dermis layer of the skin and the patient.

43
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:27,650
The patient's skin will be hot to the touch red showing infection swollen, showing a lot of fluid in their patient will have a fever.

44
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:33,950
This is a fairly serious infection, commonly group a strep and staph aureus,

45
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:41,010
or maybe staph aureus and group strep, because we see more staph aureus infections than we do with Group Strep.

46
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:45,630
Next slide. Then we go to our subcutaneous infections.

47
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:50,310
And these include abscesses, boils and ulcers.

48
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:55,080
Once again, staph aureus pops up comes to the forefront,

49
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:04,380
but the infection can be mixed and can be a mixed infection with Arabs and Arabs or in robes and in Terex is very common because of it.

50
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:08,250
If the organisms are coming from the bowel, that's what you're going to see. But it can be.

51
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:18,150
Any tiny organism can cause a subcutaneous infection. Then as we go further down, we have infections of muscle and the fashion.

52
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:24,810
OK. And this is very, very serious. This infection is called necrotizing fasciitis.

53
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:28,530
It is doesn't occur frequently, but it is very, very serious.

54
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:36,720
And when it happens, when that patient shows up in the emergency room, which is where they usually end up, they're going to be.

55
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:46,350
This is high level. It's high level of the infection spreads very rapidly along the muscle fascia because there are no barriers.

56
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:52,950
It can spread wherever it wants to. Typically, it's caused by a group strep, but also staph aureus.

57
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:59,700
Bacteroides is a common anaerobe, or even Clostridium can cause this very, very serious.

58
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:04,380
And then we have infection of the muscles, and that's called myositis.

59
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:11,460
And the most serious one here is Clostridium my own necrosis, also known as gas gangrene.

60
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:22,680
And patients, if they live through a bout of gas gangrene, will commonly lose that limb that was in.

61
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:27,810
OK, we can also have post-op wound infections,

62
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:33,780
and these can be due to the patient's own normal flora or something acquired within the

63
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:39,930
facility and the organisms that are causing the infection depend on the site of the infection.

64
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:47,970
So once again, if the patient has abdominal surgery, we would expect to see and tear or anaerobic if they have heart surgery.

65
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:56,340
Much, much more serious staph aureus is number one, followed up by rapidly growing acid fast bacilli.

66
00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:00,180
The rapid, rapidly growing Mycobacterium species. Very serious.

67
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:12,950
Very difficult to treat. We know that when there is a bite wound, the organisms from the animal's mouth get in the world and that animal can be human,

68
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:17,990
or it can be a cow, a dog, a horse, whatever a wolf, whatever.

69
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:22,820
If it's a human bite, we commonly see alpha strip.

70
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:27,800
We might see staph aureus roubaix, strep and I vanilla.

71
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:36,380
If it's a dog, we would see pastoral fear the all dogs cure all of us, all those scary pastoral or capital sites off of that.

72
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:40,260
And if it's a cat once again, pastoral.

73
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:45,690
Then we come to burn wounds, and I don't even like to think of anybody getting a burn wound because they're usually massive,

74
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:53,850
it's not like just touching a outside. They're usually massive wounds. They get infected with staph aureus.

75
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:57,030
They can also get infected with coagulation, negative staph,

76
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:08,460
the enteric such as E. coli or Klebsiella or nontariff, but a true pathogen Pseudomonas species.

77
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:16,690
And a lot of what infects the burn site depends on the site of the burn.

78
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:24,130
So there are also some special circumstances. What if a patient has vascular or neurologic problems?

79
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:28,780
So if they have neurologic problems and they have numbness in their fingers or their toes,

80
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:36,280
or some some area, and that numbness also commonly occurs with poor circulation to the area.

81
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:45,340
So not only not only having poor cleaning of the area by the blood, but you don't know that you've actually been hurt and how bad it is, it can.

82
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:53,740
This happens with oftentimes with trauma, and there can be significant infections, particularly if the patient is a diabetic.

83
00:09:53,740 --> 00:10:07,660
Diabetics immune responses are not as strong as patients who do not have diabetes, and these infections mixed flora, including anaerobic.

84
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:17,140
So if a specimen is sent to the laboratory and it's just marked world, some labs will not do an anaerobic culture on it.

85
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:22,060
And so it always needs to be ordered for aerobic and anaerobic culture.

86
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:28,660
And then finally, in those patients who have been bedridden for a long time or not truly bedridden but don't move around a lot,

87
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:38,220
they can get to Cuba, the sources or bedsores. And typically, these have mixed flora of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.

88
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:47,790
Yeah, did you have a question? Oh, OK. So more special circumstances, what about infections of the sinus tract?

89
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:55,110
Well, sinus infections are very, very common, but these are pretty much like a superficial infection once.

90
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:59,370
Hey, I'm all stuffed up. I can't breathe. You know, that put you on on an antibiotic.

91
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:03,840
So a true infection of the sinus tract is a deep seated infection.

92
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:10,290
It drains through a spontaneous channel or cavity that the patient might have.

93
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:17,130
Mostly, these occur with also with osteomyelitis.

94
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:19,950
And, of course, staph aureus.

95
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:27,840
And if they talk about draining the sight that doesn't cure it, you can drain that have it drained and the patient will feel a little bit better.

96
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:32,420
But the patient really needs broad spectrum antibiotics.

97
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:39,470
And now we get to fistulas, and these are abnormal passages between organs or between an organ in the skin.

98
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:52,370
And what I have here is a patient who have Crohn's disease have a lot of abdominal pain, a lot of diarrhea, and it's very hard to control.

99
00:11:52,370 --> 00:12:01,580
And they can develop peri rectal fistula that goes from the rectum or the bowel to another tissue.

100
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:09,920
And so then that other tissue gets infected with whatever the multitude of organisms that are present in the stool.

101
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:20,070
So this is very, very serious, and doctors who are following patients that have Crohn's disease know to ask the appropriate questions.

102
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:31,320
OK, what do we do in the lab? Well, if it's an infection of the epidermis or dermis, so the skin diagnosis is generally made on clinical grounds.

103
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:36,750
And most physicians, so it'd be like a family practice physician or an internist would generally start

104
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:43,470
the patient empirically because most common pathogens would be a staff or strep.

105
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:50,880
OK, generally they're not gram negative, but usually staff are strep, but it can also be a superficial psychosis.

106
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:56,130
And those don't respond, of course, to antibacterial antibiotics.

107
00:12:56,130 --> 00:13:04,350
So to know if it's a Marcoses, you can use a once lab, which is a fluorescent, a lab at a certain wavelength.

108
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:12,840
And if it's a fungal infection, your skin will glow. And also culture, hair, skin and nails to see what fungus it is.

109
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:22,440
And so that you, the patient, is put on the appropriate antifungal agent with infections of the epidermis dermis.

110
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:30,120
The patient can also develop erysipelas or cellulitis. And this is a clinical diagnosis.

111
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:36,780
There's very little lab testing other than to send a specimen to the lab for culture or multiple specimens for culture.

112
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:45,360
And then once again, the vesicles or bully that I already mentioned collect the fluid for a gram stain and culture so you would collect

113
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:52,740
the fluid depending on how much fluid there is could be a needle aspiration or a sterile Typekit aspiration.

114
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,120
But generally they come in as a needle.

115
00:13:54,120 --> 00:14:06,340
Aspirin, not just a swab, dipped into the food because there won't be enough specimen for the for the lab to work with.

116
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:13,990
OK, infections of the subcutaneous. That's my abbreviation, so you subcutaneous tissues, these are lesions are often open,

117
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:23,110
so they get the surface flora to the floor from the patient's skin in the lesion as well as down in this subcutaneous tissue.

118
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:30,820
And that floor down there depends on where it is. So it's just really difficult to determine which pathogens are causing the problem.

119
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:39,520
So multiple cultures are generally necessary. The way that the health care provider needs to do this is to remove the debris at the top of the wound,

120
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:44,120
wash it off and take tissue from the margin or base of the lesion.

121
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:48,790
And they may want to anesthetize the area a little bit before they do that,

122
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:55,930
because generally taking tissue is not fun and then send that to the laboratory for aerobic and anaerobic

123
00:14:55,930 --> 00:15:03,280
cultures and then down to the last one of the slide infections of muscle fascia and the muscles.

124
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:07,490
Always, always, always. You need to have blood cultures. OK.

125
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:12,650
This is deep seated infections, the patients are most likely going to be septic also,

126
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:20,510
especially if they have significant my own necrosis or tissue that is dying.

127
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:22,670
How do you collect the specimen?

128
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:32,570
If it's tissue and there's pus, you can use the swab, but in fact, multiple swabs because just a little bit on one side is not going to be enough.

129
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:37,670
And if you can make sure that you use of swab rather than a wound swab, I've talked about this before.

130
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:52,070
The flap swabs are much better and you absolutely need to make sure that there are both aerobic and anaerobic cultures done on these specimens.

131
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:56,750
OK. Same criteria for a just general wound infections.

132
00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:04,370
Clean the site as much as possible. Obtain tissue or pus from deep within.

133
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:11,190
If it's a deep wounds, go in, clean the surface and then go underneath it and and obtain tissue or plastic, whatever.

134
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:16,520
Is there? Aerobic and anaerobic cultures need to be ordered. OK.

135
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:23,000
And then with burn wounds and this is if you've ever seen a badly burned patient, it's heartbreaking.

136
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,530
Absolutely heartbreaking. University of Michigan has a wonderful burn center here.

137
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:37,100
It's one of the couple here in the state. We need to do quantitative cultures to determine how much bacteria is present in that room.

138
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,790
And so we report about in colony forming units per gram of tissue.

139
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:48,020
So if it's greater than 10 to the fifth colony forming units per gram of tissue, it's significant.

140
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:52,610
So with a burn ward, we would get a biopsy, not just a swab, a biopsy.

141
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:57,970
We will weigh it and see how why a sterile container put it in that store container,

142
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:05,360
see how much it weighs so we can figure out how many organisms per gram of tissue there is.

143
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,170
We need if you need susceptibility testing, if it's a step,

144
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:15,350
we would let you know the regular staff antibiotics that are effective against staph aureus.

145
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:23,420
But since many burn wounds are use of topical antibiotics, that needs to be a discussion between the laboratory.

146
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:33,140
And the physician is taking care of the patient. OK, because we don't typically test topical antibiotics, there's a different concentration.

147
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:49,160
We don't know how much is getting in and so on. So what sample is best for diagnosing necrotizing fasciitis vesicular fluid?

148
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:56,070
Plus. A swab from the ulcer margin for tissue.

149
00:17:56,070 --> 00:18:00,000
Anyone wouldn't want to answer tissue tissue, yes.

150
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,960
Yes, because if we take a swab from the margin that may have just surface contamination, but we wouldn't know what is truly in there.

151
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,640
It's hard to get enough pus out of devastating fasciitis and vesicular fluid.

152
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:19,140
It's once again we may not get the right amount or enough to work with.

153
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:28,430
OK, now we're switching from wounds to public health laboratories because I really wanted to fill this in.

154
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:35,460
And before class and I think you all are interested in epidemiology and public health plays a huge role in that.

155
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:38,860
So I won't be talking about the Michigan Department of Health.

156
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:46,890
OK, so public health laboratories, there are basically all organized in the same types of structures.

157
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:56,460
You have a clinical laboratory that does microbiology, you have a chemistry laboratory, a hematology lab,

158
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:03,930
and the epidemiologists that are asked are looking at diseases as they occur in the state, in the state.

159
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:10,020
We have a very amazing history of the Michigan Public Health Laboratory.

160
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:15,720
Sometime if you want to write an interesting paper, look up the history of the Michigan Health Department,

161
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:22,650
the Bureau of Laboratories and then at the health department has a chemistry, a newborn screening laboratory.

162
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:27,840
So every baby who was born in the state in the state of Michigan gets a heel tap.

163
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:36,090
They send a specimen to the state for genetic diseases. There's infectious disease testing and outreach.

164
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:44,010
They also have word the public health initiative is tops in bioterrorism and chemical terrorism.

165
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:53,340
We don't hear too much about those anymore, fortunately, but we know that if people or countries get angry enough, things can happen.

166
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:59,070
So when you still have a laboratory response network that all laboratories in the state of Michigan not just public health,

167
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:01,230
but all laboratories are involved in.

168
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:10,080
And so if one lab sees something unusual, they send it out on their own to the state for identification or additional testing.

169
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:19,410
But they also put information out on the Laboratory Response Network and the public health labs really good left as they don't do everything,

170
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:23,640
but they do a lot and they do some things that clinical laboratory staff do.

171
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:30,330
And at the state level, at the state labs really impact what happens at the national level.

172
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:32,730
We always think about sending something to CDC.

173
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:39,480
You can't miss and it seems, you know, it has to go through the state system and they will decide whether it's necessary to send it to CDC.

174
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:47,040
And if it has to go to CDC, it goes rapidly. So.

175
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:55,440
Nationally, there are groups that have left, so each state has at least one public health lab,

176
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,880
some of them have multiple labs such as Florida, has multiple public health labs.

177
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:07,860
Many major cities have their own public health lab. Detroit has their own public health lab L.A., New York City, Miami and so on.

178
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:12,310
Some in Michigan, some of the counties have their local laboratories.

179
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:19,650
Oakland has one Saginaw, Kent, Kalamazoo. There's a number of counties that have their own laboratories.

180
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:24,810
They don't do testing at the same extent that the state does or that a hospital does,

181
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:32,370
but they do a lot of screening testing to determine whether additional testing is necessary and for diseases that are of public health importance.

182
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:38,590
So my theory, gonorrhea, they test and they do a great job for that.

183
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:45,820
So this is the state laboratory in Lansing. They are about to add on to it because they have people working in aisles.

184
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:52,480
They're so crowded, that's how busy they are. Before I moved into this building, when I work for the state,

185
00:21:52,480 --> 00:22:01,360
before that we were the microbiology lab was in a building that was built in the thirties.

186
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:08,710
And so to have a TB lab, we closed off an entire wing and closed all the doors we had to have.

187
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:20,500
Access will be granted access into the TB lab. This building is so much better, and once they get the admission put on it, it will be even better.

188
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:24,550
So sand off shore is the lab director, but also my next door neighbor.

189
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:31,570
He was in medtech student that I taught, and he worked his way up, got his Ph.D. here and is now the state lab director.

190
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:39,880
And under him is a safety safety officer for the state quality assurance section in the laboratory system section.

191
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:46,000
And then further under him, there's the Division of Infectious Diseases and the Division of Chemistry and Toxicology.

192
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:55,100
And so look at the Division of Infectious Diseases. Marty Sumlin also got her Ph.D. here, so get a hint what's going on here?

193
00:22:55,100 --> 00:23:00,970
And in infectious diseases, as I said, we have a microbiology section and a virologist tested in chemistry.

194
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:08,640
We have analytical chemistry and a newborn screening that I've already mentioned.

195
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,090
So this is the history of the health department labs, the Bureau of Laboratories,

196
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:19,590
the State Board of Health was established in 1873, a long time ago, over 100 years.

197
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:31,470
Michigan is the fifth all the state health agency in the country, and the first lab was created in 1987, with a single bacteriologist doing more.

198
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:36,840
Now, granted, back in that time in 1987, there wasn't a lot you could do in the laboratory.

199
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:42,030
But still, I'm sure that person was overworked over the History Lab. Vaccines have been developed.

200
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:50,250
Whooping cough vaccine was developed in Lansing. Biological products have been produced for the contest and for diphtheria.

201
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:54,810
They've isolated they were the first lab to isolate rubella virus.

202
00:23:54,810 --> 00:24:00,660
They have developed many, many tests for people, you hemophilia and such.

203
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:06,270
It's an amazing place, and if you ever get a chance to go through that lab and talk to people and see what they do,

204
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:10,920
and I'm sure that Santa would take people out or Marty would take people on to it.

205
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:19,870
It's absolutely amazing. So pertussis, I can't talk about the health department without talking about pertussis.

206
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:27,080
So the State Bureau's doctor discovers vaccine to combat the ailment.

207
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:32,950
And so if you've ever heard of Dr. Pearl Kendrick, she was in the grant.

208
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:41,230
The state lab used to have a laboratory in Grand Rapids, so she worked in Grand Rapids and she was the one who discovered the vaccine.

209
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:51,640
It's amazing, and it was a woman. Yeah, and so so there's a huge history with whooping cough and other vaccine preventable diseases.

210
00:24:51,640 --> 00:25:01,070
And I forgot to bring it in today. But next time I'll bring in a History of women magazine and she's on the cover of it.

211
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:08,180
So here we have using Michigan Department of Health Resources and local and federal funding,

212
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:13,880
doctors Kendrick and El during shown here developed standardized diagnostic tools.

213
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:22,220
They modify and they improve the vaccines. They conducted the first large scale controlled clinical trial of pertussis vaccine.

214
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:33,980
Amazing children were no longer dying of pertussis. They participated in international efforts to standardize and distribute the vaccine.

215
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:39,460
It was just an amazing thing to do and especially done by to win women back there.

216
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:50,130
Well, when women were not accorded the given the importance that they could do things like this.

217
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:56,220
So in 1965, there was a law that established the county health department,

218
00:25:56,220 --> 00:26:02,010
they didn't have approved county health departments before 65 and the Department of Community

219
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:06,810
Health originally in 1998 with a merger of public health and the mental health departments.

220
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:09,300
In 2015, there was another merger.

221
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:15,420
Community Health and Human Services, and now the department called Michigan Department of Health and Human Services.

222
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:20,820
So DHHS is what it is now.

223
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:32,520
So the vision of new HHS is to develop and encourage measurable health, safety and self-sufficiency outcomes that reduce and prevent risks,

224
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:41,950
promote equity, foster healthy habits and transform the health and human services system to improve the lives of millions.

225
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:49,500
And I would say after having worked there for 17 years, they do that very, very well.

226
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:58,440
So how is the public health lab different from a hospital laboratory?

227
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:04,080
Public health, as you all know, focuses on guarding the health of our communities.

228
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:09,540
Yes, they're interested in individual patients, but they're looking at communities as a group.

229
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:12,030
OK, so was this it?

230
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:19,360
Not solely on individual patients, but they do help with individual cases, particularly when the lab can't provide a test that's needed.

231
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:29,510
And I might say that DHHS doesn't provide every test, but tests that are important public health importance or what they focus on.

232
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:34,730
So they do surveillance for illnesses. They do epi.

233
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:42,710
They do reference level testing, which is different from basic clinical microbiology, and they participate in state driven mandates.

234
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:51,050
So doing testing on every newborn is not only started as a state driven mandate is not national.

235
00:27:51,050 --> 00:28:00,780
But every newborn gets tested at the state level. So the testing of the lab does is population driven.

236
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:05,970
So they're not testing every person with a sore throat to see if they have strep throat.

237
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:13,650
But if there was an outbreak in the school of people who had sore throats and fevers, that's when the county would step in.

238
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:18,330
They do confirmatory or definitive testing. A lot of testing, as you know, is screening.

239
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:24,480
So this is definitive. So if a clinical lab gets a positive screening test, that is something the state does.

240
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:29,910
They can send it to the state and the state will do the confirmatory test. They do stereotyping.

241
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:38,040
They do extensive molecular characterization. And they, of course, look for bio threat agents.

242
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:42,390
I'm glad we haven't had to deal with this in a very long time.

243
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:48,090
It's scary when we do, but the state is there to help every laboratory do the very best to detect them.

244
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:51,540
They also do this. More esoteric had already mentioned the newborn screening.

245
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:59,340
Sometimes they also monitor fish for toxins. So you never know what they're going to get into.

246
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:02,790
So they do environmental surveillance, they do well monitoring.

247
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:07,770
They develop methods that can then be shared generally with other public health departments because

248
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:14,670
the methods that they detect are generally not usable or applicable to clinical microbiology labs,

249
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:19,870
but would be more fair on the larger scale. They have grants, they outreach to do outreach training.

250
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:34,680
They do all sorts of things. So this is a general listing of what the organics unit does in chemistry, so it's all cap accredited.

251
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:38,730
It's also accredited by the American Industrial Hygiene Association.

252
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:44,040
And then they also participate in the Fish and Environmental Surveillance Program.

253
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:49,110
And I don't need to read these to you, but you can see it under the the left hand column.

254
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:55,710
They do bio monitoring, looking for toxic substances, the chlorinated pesticides and so on.

255
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:59,940
They do testing in the state for chemical threats.

256
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:06,720
And fortunately, we have not had much here, but it would be done at the state.

257
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:15,150
So you can read through this when you have more time just to get an idea of what the state lab does in chemistry.

258
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:21,720
They also have a trace metals unit, and it is accredited by college American pathologists,

259
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:26,670
the American Industrial Hygiene Association and bio monitoring and fish programs.

260
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:35,970
So they can they can look at whole blood capillary or being a specimen so they can prep them.

261
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:45,480
They can look for all various levels of metals and cadmium, mercury and so on.

262
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:51,900
As you can see down in the bottom, come all done in that laboratory. They can test soil and dust samples.

263
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:56,850
They participate in the in the Food Emergency Response Network.

264
00:30:56,850 --> 00:31:01,560
So somebody put contaminated food or toxic food or food that had a chemical,

265
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:10,830
and they would be able to determine what it is inside and then do the epidemiology to see where it has been, where it came from and so on.

266
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:17,610
They're looking at working on spices, teas and supplements to look for metals in them right now.

267
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:21,750
And then the bio monitoring and fish program.

268
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:31,950
I think it's very clear looking for mercury using a mercury analyzer on fish and they analyze the fish for numerous other compounds,

269
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:39,200
and they have many projects going on to look for other toxic products.

270
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:47,390
So as I said, they screen all babies, all newborns in the state of Michigan, over 50 tests are done on the heel stick.

271
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:54,740
It's amazing their endocrine and metabolic genetic disorders, they're looking for cystic fibrosis, PKU sickle cell.

272
00:31:54,740 --> 00:32:00,920
This is the first time that most babies will ever be tested. One and only time will be tested if they get a positive.

273
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:11,540
They can go on with that. The state will confer with the appropriate physician for physicians for that patient.

274
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:20,450
So. Infectious diseases, why did the germ cross the microscope to get to the other slide, Marty?

275
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:28,830
These are body cell lines like she gave it to me and she put some not so good jokes in there.

276
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:34,410
So the state lab does consultations every day, they're consulting with epidemiologists,

277
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:43,290
infection control and physicians to us to make sure that the appropriate tests are being ordered, the appropriate drugs are being tested and so on.

278
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:53,460
And here are the phone numbers for the main lab and for the Infectious Diseases Administration, and those numbers have not changed in a long time.

279
00:32:53,460 --> 00:33:03,180
So for infectious disease testing, the microbiology section, they do bacterial know parasitic mycobacteria, well,

280
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:06,780
you say more on just a minute fungal molecular,

281
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:15,720
they look for select agents if there was a suspect terrorism attack and they test foods for various products.

282
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:21,550
The virology section they do serology, they look for HIV, rabies, it's in a lab,

283
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:32,190
in a state that does rabies testing, molecular testing, cell culture and pandemic response and select agents also.

284
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:38,550
So some tests, many tests you can just send there, but you don't need pre-approval, some tests need pre-approval.

285
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:46,500
So this is the list examples of tests that require pre-approval to to match up and then a

286
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:52,740
positive environmental sample with a clinical isolate in cases of hospital acquired infections.

287
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:57,030
They test for arboviruses, but they do TV PCR.

288
00:33:57,030 --> 00:34:03,720
I'll talk a little bit more about that in a minute. The test for botulism only lab in the state that tests for botulism and it has to go into mice.

289
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:10,290
And I have injected many, many, many black 6J mice with specimens for botulism.

290
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:13,680
And then they look to see the mouse dies, while at the same time they inject in the mouse,

291
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:19,080
they will inject another set of mice with an antioxidant to see if that advertise and protect the mouse.

292
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:24,990
They test with approval after getting approval for a mumps, measles and rubella.

293
00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:29,760
They do the right hand side norovirus PCR toxic shock syndrome.

294
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:35,040
One of the few labs in the state that does, if any, this thing is the only legacy those types of shot.

295
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:42,210
They'll test suspicious powders. They do so typing on Streptococcus isolates to determine if there's an outbreak going on with the same strain,

296
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:47,380
and they'll also look for newly newly emerging pathogens.

297
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:53,650
So another of Marty's jokes, special project Centers of Excellence, Midway School for the Gifted,

298
00:34:53,650 --> 00:35:02,110
and the person can't get through the door if it's not pulling pushing. Working at what can I say, she put it in there.

299
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:05,800
I will tell you that this building that you're seeing in here,

300
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:13,180
the walls and that door looks like the first microbiology lab that I worked in at the state and it is still standing there at the state.

301
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:15,730
I don't know what they're using it for, but they haven't tore it down.

302
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:21,550
If you ever get to Lansing, you go to the health department, it's right on the corner and you think, how could they work in that building?

303
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:32,310
We did. They are the National Molecular Surveillance Center for Tuberculosis.

304
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:40,020
OK, all isolates of TB in the United States and the territories come to Michigan for a genotyping and hold use gene sequencing,

305
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:55,500
and I think this is a fabulous thing for the state lab and the supervisor of the TB lab has worked extremely hard to get this up and running.

306
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:58,730
They are also, does anybody here know what Postnet is?

307
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:07,800
People know that it's OK, it's a national subnational system for notifying other laboratories when you've got something interesting.

308
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:12,450
So if you look at the map, Michigan is here in the Midwest, OK?

309
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:21,840
And they the health departments cooperates with Wisconsin, Minnesota with Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky.

310
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:31,140
So it's this region that we're in. In Postnet, they do molecular testing for Shiga toxin producing E. coli, listeria, salmonella, shigella.

311
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:36,300
They offer assistance assistance to other states in the Midwest, further west as experts,

312
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:41,190
they do training, they do backup testing and they test out new technologies.

313
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:47,910
This is all testing but is not available in clinical laboratories and its use.

314
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:58,110
If you get a positive here and a pulse that the notice goes out to all the other states, Hey, we have this.

315
00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:08,040
So the ghost system is the global hepatitis outbreak surveillance tool and provides whole genome sequencing for hepatitis C virus,

316
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:15,610
not A or B, but C, and this there is used to differentiate outbreaks and provide better data for EPI.

317
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:23,010
And I think that is very cool also, because oftentimes hepatitis C is hard to detect because we know about it have A and B,

318
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:28,750
but there aren't a whole lot of tests for Hep C and this this takes care of it.

319
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:40,390
And then, my friend, antimicrobial resistance, they are a center of excellence for detection of newer types of resistance markers.

320
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:44,500
So for India, one that they can detect it then,

321
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:55,630
which is very integrin and coded metallo beta lactamase oxa like enzymes that were thought to be class two, which hydrolyzed is oxygen.

322
00:37:55,630 --> 00:38:04,630
They can look for any. Panama says they can look for mobilized colistin resistance, of which there are two separate types NCR one and NCR two.

323
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:12,670
And they do screening for resistance markers from rectal swabs, from health care facilities upon request.

324
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:16,180
Now that request has to go through epidemiology and they have to give approval.

325
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:20,380
But they do this testing, and it really has helped to cut down on the spread of the very,

326
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:30,100
very most difficult to detect and most difficult to treat types of resistance.

327
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:35,770
And then we have the Food Emergency Response Network, anybody in here ever having had a food illness?

328
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:40,780
Anybody? Well, that's wonderful. I don't like to see any answer to that question.

329
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:46,240
So when there is a foodborne outbreak, the state gets called in there a Tier one lab.

330
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:51,040
They can provide testing for biological agents as well as chemical agents.

331
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:55,870
And this is a joint program between the health department and the Department of Agriculture.

332
00:38:55,870 --> 00:39:03,040
Because, as you know, some of the animals and waters in particular have a lot of chemicals in them.

333
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:12,520
They do surveillance outbreak assistance. I don't even like to talk to bioterrorism or about bioterrorism or chemical terrorism using food products,

334
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:23,110
but they they they do that and they participate in USDA and FDA programs.

335
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:33,360
So Zika. Zika, they do a PR, which is a plaque reduction neutralization test for Zika.

336
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:37,350
There are confirmatory center for that test. We know people like to travel.

337
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:42,210
They travel all over the world and sometimes they come back with diseases that nobody knows what they are.

338
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:49,950
So if you look at this map, there are 14 states that receive support from Michigan for testing for Zika.

339
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:56,940
So if a patient is in one of these red states here has a suspect physician's hesitation.

340
00:39:56,940 --> 00:40:02,760
When the suspect case of Zika, they can send the specimen to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services,

341
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:16,870
and they will do the testing free of charge. And then to try and get kids interested in science, because, as you know,

342
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:21,190
we all we we're not going to live forever, we're not going to want to work forever.

343
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:24,400
We need people to come behind us and take over.

344
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:32,350
So explore life sciences like K through 12 educational program developed by the Bureau of Laboratories and M.B.A.

345
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:41,110
If it introduces young students to science and engages them to try and figure out how things happen in the laboratory.

346
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:44,500
And it offers live science demonstrations.

347
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:54,940
It's very cool in classrooms and at science fairs also has a website that's age appropriate with information, and the website is shown here.

348
00:40:54,940 --> 00:41:03,430
Michigan Slash Explore Live Science and then the Bureau of Laboratories itself offers an Explore Lab

349
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:11,620
Science internship for college students who think they might want to go into public health laboratory.

350
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:24,010
And so they have this internship for them, and there is a key address here if you're interested in the Explore lab science program.

351
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:26,750
So risk assessments.

352
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:38,420
So if you think there's an outbreak going on, but you can't figure out what it is, the state will provide a group to assist across various agencies.

353
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:45,560
So it might be and might be. Public health might be natural resources, but they all get together and they figure out what's going on.

354
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:51,050
They can do Ebola and special pathogens. Fortunately, we don't have Ebola in the United States.

355
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:55,310
However, people do travel and they can bring it back.

356
00:41:55,310 --> 00:42:02,660
They can do risk assessments for clinical labs and risk assessments and best practices guidance for university teaching labs.

357
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:15,880
So they are they are spreading the information as wide as they possibly can.

358
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:25,360
Yeah. OK, so now on to preparedness. I don't even like to think about how scared we were when we thought when we were all into bio terrorism.

359
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:33,970
It was a it was an unnerving time. Absolutely unnerving. We never knew when we were going to open up a test request.

360
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:38,890
And and this has happened. They have been tested. Tests sent in.

361
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:44,590
You open up the test request. It says you will be dead in 24 hours. This is absolutely happened.

362
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:51,700
No person didn't die in 24 hours, in fact didn't get scared, really got scared, but they didn't get sick.

363
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:56,950
But that's the type of thing. I mean, even now, it gives me cold shivers to even think about that.

364
00:42:56,950 --> 00:43:06,130
So they are top notch in being prepared. And as you see in this cartoon run for it is not an adequate emergency action plan.

365
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:12,720
You have to be prepared and know how to handle things.

366
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:20,070
So bio terrorism and chemical terrorism testing, this is one of the labs at the state and you can see the person is all garbed up.

367
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:30,450
And I will tell you, you get very hot in those suits. They do training for hazardous materials, biological shipping and packaging training courses.

368
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:34,530
So if you want to send a specimen to a lab and doesn't go on a curb,

369
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:38,250
you have to go through the mail, you have to have a package, according to guidelines.

370
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:42,750
And they also do training on bio about bioterrorism threat guidance.

371
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:51,260
They also do chemical terrorism preparedness training also.

372
00:43:51,260 --> 00:44:04,970
Next slide. So biological terrorism. It is suspicious powder testing for law enforcement, and they collaborate with the FBI.

373
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:15,560
And yes, I have spoken with many FBI agents in my years, and they're generally very nice and very appreciative of what we do in the laboratory.

374
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:23,330
We rule out any terrorism type organisms from clinical isolates.

375
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:27,380
And we have emergency response plans for biological organisms.

376
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:34,190
So if patients came in and they didn't know that they had Ebola or stars or even murderers,

377
00:44:34,190 --> 00:44:39,620
the state would step in and make sure that everything was being done correctly. So nobody else got infected.

378
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:48,320
They participate in the Department of Homeland Security testing for biological threat agents from air samples, and they test 365 days a year for that.

379
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:52,080
And then they have Sentinel Labs and the several labs or the county or state health.

380
00:44:52,080 --> 00:45:01,460
The county health departments and the Sentinel Labs participate in lab preparedness exercises provided by college American pathologists every year.

381
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:10,400
So the central labs? So it would be the county health department here or Ingham County at Lansing or Detroit Health

382
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:16,640
Department at various health departments across the state will participate in the lab preparedness.

383
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:21,320
And if they don't do the testing, what do they have to do? They have to make sure it's packaged correctly.

384
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:26,960
They need to send out the appropriate notices, make sure that the courier drives it directly to the state lab.

385
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,300
You know, things like that. They're not going to be working with it,

386
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:40,260
but they'll get to make sure it gets to the state lab as soon as possible in the best possible shape and that nothing is spread.

387
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:47,580
So if there's chemical terrorism and there just was a chemical terrorism attack somewhere in Southeast Asia, I don't remember where it was,

388
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:58,680
but there just was one was there and I believe and this shows that Tokyo 1995 attack with sarin on a subway and there cleaning on the subway there.

389
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:02,550
So in this one, about three thousand eight hundred people were injured.

390
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:07,530
Six hundred and forty one people in one hour showed up at one hospital.

391
00:46:07,530 --> 00:46:15,890
And that's what a chemical terrorism attack it's many people, all at one time.

392
00:46:15,890 --> 00:46:22,340
So they do know this is part of the chemistry lab and they're doing chemical terrorism testing once it's inside the equipment.

393
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:33,210
You don't have to wear all your garb. But until it's there, you have to be masked down and so on.

394
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:38,340
So they do chemical threat response, people don't think about chemical threats.

395
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:43,950
They think about biological, somebody spreading something throughout the atmosphere and everybody brings it in.

396
00:46:43,950 --> 00:46:53,040
But chemicals are even easier to disperse. And health care facilities need to be prepared to respond to a chemical exposure,

397
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:59,410
whether it's large or small in an intentional could be an accident accident in a plant someplace.

398
00:46:59,410 --> 00:47:06,970
Lab testing is very, very important, as his follow up monitoring and prosecuting perpetrators.

399
00:47:06,970 --> 00:47:12,830
They're not going to just let somebody get away with this. So I'm not going to read all this to you, but this is very important.

400
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:19,450
I think everybody who goes into public health needs to know about terrorism, whether it's bacterial or chemical.

401
00:47:19,450 --> 00:47:33,010
You need to be aware that it can happen. It has happened and we all have to do everything we possibly can to prevent it from ever happening again.

402
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:38,660
So. How to select good laboratory tests.

403
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:42,200
So a salesman comes into your office and says, Hey, I got it,

404
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:46,350
says I can do this and this and this and this, and it's going to be the only test you ever need.

405
00:47:46,350 --> 00:47:51,290
First, it's going to cost, you know, a thousand dollars standard, but it's the only thing you ever need.

406
00:47:51,290 --> 00:47:59,450
That's not the way we handle these things. So considerations for good laboratory tests are the cost of the tests and what it can detect.

407
00:47:59,450 --> 00:48:06,020
What's the turnaround time, how much equipment is needed? Do we have room for that equipment?

408
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:11,210
What's the intended final use of the results? How easy is it to interpret the results?

409
00:48:11,210 --> 00:48:12,380
Some results come off machines.

410
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:20,690
You have no idea what it's talking about, and even if you learn in the lab, the physician or nurse practitioner out in the community will know.

411
00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:27,500
You have to have an explanatory statement. There is the test screening test or is it a diagnostic test?

412
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:33,260
There's a big difference between the two, and there are a lot of things that cause inappropriate test results,

413
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:37,400
such as sending plasma where you were supposed to send serum for testing.

414
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:45,860
That's a big one, and having an anticoagulant that is EDTA versus heparin can cause bad test results.

415
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:47,390
And how are the specimens stored?

416
00:48:47,390 --> 00:48:56,100
So the state really tries to train people in how to do good laboratory testing and people think, well, my staff went to medical school.

417
00:48:56,100 --> 00:49:05,390
They're all licensed medical technologies. That's the beginning. There are other things beyond what you learn in medtech school.

418
00:49:05,390 --> 00:49:16,520
So here is. The analysis of a specimen that goes from the pre analytic phase on the right hand side,

419
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:23,150
over here, over here, and a decision is made to to perform a test in the laboratory.

420
00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:27,860
The orders placed orders transferred to the lab enter the information of the

421
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:32,160
computer to get the final finally of the specimen into the lab specimens analyzed.

422
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:37,580
Reports generated. Now we're either on the left side. The result is conveyed to the clinician.

423
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:41,990
The clinician may or may not understand the report.

424
00:49:41,990 --> 00:49:48,370
So every report test has to have a statement. For further information, please contact.

425
00:49:48,370 --> 00:49:57,190
X and X, so the date is interpreted correctly, and then there's a clinical response to that result.

426
00:49:57,190 --> 00:50:08,280
That's the entire analytic phase. So we talk about gold standard tests.

427
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:12,610
See, the little mouse I went through a lot of these little black mice during grad school,

428
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:24,840
a lot of them c57bl six days a diagnostic test or a benchmark that is best under reasonable conditions is a gold standard.

429
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:33,600
Positive tests do not always have high sensitivity or specificities, but they are what you compare every other test to look.

430
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:45,440
They give you the right answer, but they may not detect every single one or the best specificity, maybe a little bit off.

431
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:50,350
So what's the impact of public health labs?

432
00:50:50,350 --> 00:50:56,660
As you may know, I'm very pro for public health laboratories, they often serve as reference laboratories for clinical labs.

433
00:50:56,660 --> 00:51:03,700
That happens in every state in the nation. You can have the best lab in the world, but there will be some tests you can't do and the doctor's got.

434
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:08,120
Have you call your state lab and say, Hey, can you do this? Yes, it is a specimen.

435
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:17,120
This is a specimen we need and you get it done that way. They cover testing for an insured or underinsured populations.

436
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:23,150
They provide data to support epidemiologic investigations. How are you doing any research?

437
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:26,780
Anybody in here that have data, don't you?

438
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:34,850
Lots and lots of data. They provide a national system to test in case of a large scale emergency.

439
00:51:34,850 --> 00:51:45,680
New type of influenza is that type of thing or a bio threat, and they bring emerging disease tests online very quickly,

440
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:52,010
much more quickly than a clinical lab can, because the tests may not be FDA approved.

441
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:57,020
They may not be able to get it into their computer system, and they may not know how to order it.

442
00:51:57,020 --> 00:52:00,140
There's a lot of things that go into it, but if you can get it into the public health system,

443
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:04,250
you can always send the appropriate sample to public health and they will do it.

444
00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:10,970
And this is what's been done with Zika. There's no need to test Zika in every licensed hospital lab in Michigan.

445
00:52:10,970 --> 00:52:17,750
But if somebody travels to Africa, they come back with Zika or what they think a Zika specimen can be sent there,

446
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:27,980
or if they get bitten by a mosquito that might be carrying Zika specimen can be sent to the state lab.

447
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:36,110
So this is the final slide in this section is a statement by Dr. Everett Koop, who was the surgeon general for eight years.

448
00:52:36,110 --> 00:52:39,680
You all may have heard of him before. Health care is vital to all this.

449
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:44,180
Some of the time, the public health is vital to all of us, all of the time.

450
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:51,230
That is a statement that we all need to live by. We're all in public health in one way or another.

451
00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:57,980
And this statement will never be outdated. Never.

452
00:52:57,980 --> 00:53:07,840
OK, any questions on all of that? No question.

453
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:12,910
That's amazing. OK,

454
00:53:12,910 --> 00:53:18,160
I will see you on Monday and on Monday it will be a short lecture on nursing because I haven't

455
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:23,380
had a lecture on nursing yet and anything else that I think I haven't talked enough about.

456
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:27,460
I will include there also, but I will not take over an hour.

457
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:36,610
OK. And I hope that all of you study very hard for your files and I hope you always everything.

458
00:53:36,610 --> 00:53:41,710
And if anybody wants tests that they haven't done yet, we can hand them out.

459
00:53:41,710 --> 00:53:51,026
Except, of course, for the next one that's coming out.
