1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
And we are going to take a quick break and be back we'll start that one at a 11

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:14,000
All right.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So this session is going to be streaming, grading with grade scope.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We are recording this session. We can share it out afterward.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:34,000
If you have any questions, feel free to drop them in the chat

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Great scope is a tool that is licensed at the University level.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So it's available across all departments through canvas and is ready to use at any time.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You all are in a unique spot, because maybe instructors have already set up the assignments.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
But as the graders, you may find some things in here that would really help.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:20,000
With grading efficiency. In fact, we last summer, earlier in the summer spring. we spoke with a Gsi from last fall and biostat 5 21 that how you use grade scope before and approach their

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:32,000
instructor about implementing it. and so the instructor was fine with the Gsi's doing that, and they found it to really streamline their workflow.

12
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So I hope you find it useful. And Yeah, we just jump right in oops.

13
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So what can Gradescope do? What makes it special and different from how we grade and canvas Now, speed Greater is a pretty neat tool, but great scope has some very unique features, and so i'll talk through these

14
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
briefly.

15
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Great scope. I think one of the main drivers, and why it was designed was to great handwritten homework submissions a little easier.

16
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So. It seems to have been created out of a all right.

17
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Taking a handwritten exam. I pick all those up. but instead of taking these papers and grading them one by one, I go scan them in and grade them digitally.

18
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
So there's a lot of this sort of design to the grade scope platform.

19
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Now we know we can do that in speed greater. We can have students scan and take pictures of their work and submit it.

20
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:58,000
But there's some other features that really lend itself a little bit better to that grading process one of those is in great scope.

21
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You can grade question by question. So homework problem set one question, one

22
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I can grade all those across all students or all of those across the students just in my sections that i'm responsible for grading.

23
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:28,000
And then I can go to question 2 and that's going to help with consistency across multiple graders in addition, and not just that, but also the way grade scope set up what it calls its grading rubrics.

24
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
The way it talks about rubrics is identifying.

25
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Why the student has lost points, and how many points and when you're in a course with multiple graders.

26
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You're gonna see who what graders have developed points for what types of errors, And you're going to be able to use those same deductions and apply them to the assignment homework your grading on top of

27
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:05,000
that for those of you that were in the Kvas session when we were in speed, greater greater is implemented a really great comment library.

28
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
So I can easily reuse comments however, that's limited to just comments.

29
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I make to my account grapescope has all of those saved at the assignment level in the course.

30
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:35,000
So i'm going to be able to see what kinds of feedback other graders have given, and i'm going to be able to reuse those same comments, so that consistent experience across multiple graders which is something we hear from

31
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:48,000
students of Well, this this greater grades harder than what the grade I saw my friend get with another grader

32
00:04:48,000 --> 00:05:00,000
A very new, unique aspect is, you can actually set up online assignments, and I call them worksheets almost that can save a student's work.

33
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So they can come back later and continue working on it, and then submit before the deadline.

34
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:20,000
This comes into play a lot particularly if someone is trying to use a a quiz function in canvas because it has the nice multiple choice questions.

35
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Or I can type things open-ended. This would almost make that easier to do and make it possible for students to be able to sit more than once, and I apologize.

36
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I mean not replacing the quizzes because the quiz is great, for when you're taking an actual timed quiz, or an exam where you get one shot to completed and submit sometimes what instructors are looking

37
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,000
for is I. I like that style of the quiz filling the blank.

38
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Those kinds of things, but I want students to be able to save their work.

39
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Come back to it before they submit, you know. use it in sort of a problem.

40
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Set and you can do that with grade scope.

41
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Great scope offers the flexibility for individual or group assignments.

42
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Every once in a while i'll hear from an instructor that mentions

43
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Can I? This, you know, this was a group assignment, but some students have asked to work individually, or vice versa.

44
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:46,000
This is an individual assignment, but some students have asked if they can do it as a group canvas doesn't offer that flexibility, that submission, assignment, submission to canvas is one or the other, and so

45
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:55,000
we often say the best we can do is have each student in the group submit the same thing, and then you have to go.

46
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Apply their grade, you know the same grade to each student.

47
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Great scope allows us some flexibility with that of if i've worked with a group.

48
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I can select my group members names and sort of submit with them, you know.

49
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Kind of loop them into my submission or if i've worked individually.

50
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I don't link any other here's into that assignment. which is just really neat from my standpoint in supporting that kind of flexible assignment.

51
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I don't recommend you, know, we want students to know how to submit their own work, but every once in a while a student runs into issues and they panic and they email you their paper instead of uploading it to

52
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:48,000
canvas. it happens. grade scope does allow you to submit on behalf of a student.

53
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Canvas does not have that functionality so we have to say you have to submit, but I will remove the late flag, or i'll reopen the assignment.

54
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:08,000
So you can submit. there's some communication that has to go in there depending on the how the assignment is set up.

55
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Great scope, offers Ai assisted answer, grouping.

56
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:24,000
So say you do give a quiz on paper. Students write it out because they maybe they have to show their work or their calculations.

57
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
We collected up. everyone turns their papers in afterward.

58
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:39,000
We scan those into great scope and if it's a scenario where the there's only one right answer, You know It's maybe not an open-ended essay question.

59
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:50,000
That's going to be needs to be reviewed by the instructor grade scope has an ai assisted answer grouping, so that you can say all right.

60
00:08:50,000 --> 00:09:02,000
All of these have the same answer. they're all correct and you basically can grade a bulk of papers or a bulk of you know.

61
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Question one all at once.

62
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And then, lastly, when you create the questions, that you're scoring on, and when you use those rubric items of what you deducted points for and I say, deduct points, but actually you could reverse the

63
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:27,000
rubric setup and do point accumulation. They call it positive scoring.

64
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
So you can set up to greed, either way by deduction or by addition.

65
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:39,000
When you use those rubric items you're going to be able to get analytics on those on a question by question level.

66
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:49,000
So the instructor is going to have a really good picture of what students were missing, And were there a lot of students that were missing this, And maybe we need to review these before they exam.

67
00:09:49,000 --> 00:10:03,000
So a lot of extremely unique features that you might find use cases for in your teaching, and the courses you're supporting

68
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:13,000
As I mentioned, this is already integrated into canvas and how it works. Is you create an assignment, or maybe there's already assignment.

69
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:28,000
And that it's set to a file upload assignment What we want to do is set the submission type to external tool, and in the list of tools we're gonna set it to be a grade scope

70
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:38,000
assignment, and that just means when students open this assignment it's going to send them over to grade scope.

71
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
When this gets set up you would, of course, set up the assignment.

72
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Set up your grade scope course but submission whether students submit, or the instructor submits in in that example, where maybe it's an exam.

73
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:03,000
That they're doing by hand, and I scan those in for them as the instructor the submission step and the grading happens in great scope.

74
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:14,000
But because of that canvas integration, the grades that you post in grade scope are going to get passed back to the canvas grade book so that they can be waited and counted with all of those other assignments

75
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:22,000
quizzes, exams.

76
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:29,000
When I say the external tool, when you create a new assignment, there's a lot of settings like setting the points.

77
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:35,000
But one of the settings is the submission type and so this dropped down.

78
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:45,000
If you're creating a new assignment this may default to no submission but your options are you know a Url.

79
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Are you file upload? Are you submitting something in a text entry box?

80
00:11:50,000 --> 00:12:05,000
But one of them is external tool and then I would click the find button which is going to let me scroll through all of the tools that it has set up to integrate with canvas and they're listed in

81
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:16,000
alphabetical order. So i'm going. to look for grade scope and select that. And then we recommend, when integrating these tools that you load them in a new tab.

82
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
And that's basically, so that it's not trying to open it in the canvas window, and it's really small.

83
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:33,000
It'll open it up it'll be bigger they can see all the menus

84
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Great scope has 5 different assignment types. that you can set up.

85
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:49,000
The first one is the homework problem set. So this would just be homework that students are completing.

86
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Maybe they're completing it in a word document maybe they're printing it off, and completing it by hand.

87
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:06,000
All uploads to great scope have to be in a Pdf format or a scanned image file.

88
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Grapevope has recently released an app that will scan things, scan papers for you, and allows you to attach image files

89
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:25,000
The homework problem set is particularly in the tutorial

90
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
The tutorial information it is set up to be free form.

91
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:36,000
They call it variable length. so maybe one student who does it in word is able to submit 2 pages.

92
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:45,000
But I printed it out. did it? on hand and I have 2 additional pages of scratch paper. So maybe I've got like 5 pages total.

93
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Basically it's saying, students are gonna have different lengths of submissions depending on how they completed the work.

94
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Another one is the online assignment. So this is the one I was talking to you.

95
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
That kind of creates a worksheet similar. It looks similar to taking a quiz.

96
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:19,000
But but you don't have to complete it all in one sitting so I could save and complete that later.

97
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Great scope supports a bubble sheet. exams.

98
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:29,000
So if you are taking a scantron where you have a booklet of the exam.

99
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:36,000
That has the questions, and you're answering by filling in bubbles on a separate piece of paper.

100
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,000
And so then those would get scanned and bubble sheet really lends itself to that.

101
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Ai grouping and scoring for faster grading

102
00:14:50,000 --> 00:15:07,000
There's also the exam and some of the examples. we're going to look at in some of the demo videos. we're about to see demonstrate this example, and the exam and the homework problem set are very similar in my mind

103
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:22,000
So there's some flexibility there which you're basically choosing one of these based on whether you want students to see it as an exam or see it categorizes the homework great scope sort of

104
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:30,000
presents the exam as a template document where all students are answering in the same location.

105
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:38,000
You know. once all students are going to have 2 pages there's not going to be one student that has 5 pages out of nowhere.

106
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
It's a template i'm providing the template.

107
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:59,000
They're completing it and again. i'm gonna be able to set predefined regions of where the answers should be in order to accommodate that ai grouping take advantage of that feature.

108
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:05,000
And lastly, which might be interesting to this group. There is a programming assignment in grade scope.

109
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Students can upload programming files in multiple languages.

110
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:33,000
They can also link Github accounts or bit bucket accounts to submit that way, and the great scope allows you to build an auto grader to sort of check their programming assignment or you can manually

111
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:46,000
score it, using the rubrics similar to the homework and exam rubric items

112
00:16:46,000 --> 00:17:02,000
So this is a little little difficult to sort of picture but let's look at some demos, so you can see it in action, and if you have any questions while you're watching this please feel free to post them in the

113
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:09,000
chat and I would be happy to address those

114
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
So I want to give a little bit of context to the grading example.

115
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,000
We're about to see it's going to show us how grading works in grade scope.

116
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:36,000
In this example they've created A midterm that's been created by hand, or i'm sorry it's been completed by hand that created. and so I'm gonna pull this up so this is the midterm that was given to

117
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:48,000
the pretend group of students. They have a field for their name they're supposed to put their student. Id they're supposed to answer questions. here.

118
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Here.

119
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:59,000
They have an image they need to mark up

120
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:06,000
And question 3: draw Lewis structure, and then a multiple choice example.

121
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:13,000
And so in this example that we're going to see them grading students have been given this exam.

122
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:19,000
They've completed it by hand the instructors collected it and scanned it into grade.

123
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Scope and upload by instructor and so Now they're in the grading phase, or the graders are ready to go in and grade those one quick note about scanning.

124
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I know i've talked about instructors doing the bulk of the scanning

125
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:55,000
If that seems like a lot of work I do want to say that a lot of the copiers in the departmental areas and potentially even the sites lab on the ground floor of sph we'll let you take a stack of

126
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:03,000
papers and put it through this. Put them, place them in the feeder, and it will scan all of those as one file and email it to you.

127
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:10,000
So. so, while scanning may feel daunting, some of the tools we have here in the building are going to make that really easy.

128
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
And not only that grade scope you can upload that whole Pdf.

129
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Of all the students and grade scope has a way to quickly break those up to individual students, really, and an interesting tool to kind of help you get through these things faster

130
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:39,000
So we're gonna look at a video we're actually gonna look at a few, because each one talks about a different aspect of grading.

131
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,000
This one is a grading, a simple question just sort of the the very basic.

132
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:50,000
So we're gonna get a look at this rubric over here

133
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:59,000
And that's going to be the main focus of this video

134
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Let me make sure i'm sharing my sound Yes, so let me know if you're not able to hear this from my home page.

135
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Let's select the demo course grades cope 101 Let's select the demo midterm.

136
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:23,000
We are currently in the great submissions tab let's select question 3.1, and let's start grading the left.

137
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
We have the current students answer to the question. We are grading on the right.

138
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:35,000
We have the rubric, the which currently has just one entry which corresponds to the student having the correct answer.

139
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:44,000
The current student, indeed, has the correct answer. so we can just select the existing entry in the rubric, and we just graded the first student.

140
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Now we click the next button, and our presented with the next student's answer to this same question.

141
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,000
This student made a mistake. They forgot the electrons around Tios.

142
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
We add a rubric item corresponding to this mistake.

143
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:15,000
We type the description for it. So students understand what we are marking them off for, and we decide to subtract 1 point for this mistake we select this new entry, and we just graded the second student we click the Next button, to

144
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,000
move on to the next. student. This student has single bonds instead of double bonds.

145
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:27,000
That's a new type of mistake. we added into the rubric, and for this mistake we'll subtract 2 points.

146
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
We check it off. The student also forgot the electrons around the Os.

147
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:38,000
We checked that off, too, and we click the index button to move on to the next student.

148
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:50,000
This student forgot to electrons around theos this is a mistake. we've seen before, so we simply mark the corresponding rubric entry, and we are done with grading this student coming to think of it getting the bonds wrong is a much

149
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:58,000
bigger mistake than for getting the electrons. so subtracting a full point for just for getting the electrons might be a little much.

150
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:05,000
So let's change it into only subtracting 0 point 5 points, and let's change the text to clarify.

151
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:13,000
We deem it only a minor error. These changes will apply to all students, including Brett, tractively to the students.

152
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:20,000
We already graded

153
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Alright. So what we saw in that video, or creating rubric items as you go.

154
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:38,000
If this were, say, a paper where an instructor has created a preset rubric.

155
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
That students are going to be scored on that could be entered in any advance.

156
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:51,000
But in some cases, maybe, you don't know what kind of errors students may have, and so you can do it live like this.

157
00:22:51,000 --> 00:23:12,000
And, as I mentioned, all other graders are going to be able to see the same rubric items, and in the example where he made a change to the amount that was deducted, that would also apply to all of the other times retroactively.

158
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:29,000
so for everyone in the whole course. And so, when I was speaking with the biostats Gsi from last year from last fall, she had mentioned that they would have these, you know, group text discussions about making changes to that Rubric and

159
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
they would decide, and somebody would go in and change it and they would sort of do that as a group.

160
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:40,000
So that's a case for a you know large group of graders.

161
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:49,000
But a way better option than going in one by one, and modifying all of those students scores.

162
00:23:49,000 --> 00:24:07,000
If you decided to change the value of something

163
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:14,000
And also notice that kind of focusing on that question by question grading every time they would click.

164
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Next they would be at the same place that document every time.

165
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:35,000
And so this green box around here is a preset region the instructor, the greater setup, so that every time i'm looking at question 3.

166
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:46,000
It's gonna 0 in on this section of the each student's paper

167
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:56,000
One thing the Gsi group last year really liked was the keyboard shortcuts being able to take advantage of those.

168
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:04,000
So I want to end it. wanted to include this video

169
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Whenever we encounter the same mistake again, we can grade especially quickly, because all we have to do is mark. the corresponding rubric item using keyboard shortcuts can make this even faster.

170
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
The student needs rubric items, 2 and 3 marked.

171
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
We simply tap the numbers 2 and 3 on the keyboard to mark them.

172
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,000
We can then simply tap the right arrow key to move on to the next student.

173
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,000
So with just a couple of quick keystrokes we can greet a student who made mistakes.

174
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:46,000
We've seen before. General hovering the cursor over buttons will reveal their keyboard shortcut, for example, hovering over the next button here shows that the right arrow is the keyboard shortcut and

175
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:52,000
hovering over the next ungraded button reveals that Z is the corresponding keyboard shortcut.

176
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Here are a few additional keyword shortcuts on the grading page. that you may find useful.

177
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
You can press G and F. to zoom in and out of the student.

178
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Submission. Press R. to rotate the submission. Press J.

179
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
And K. to go to the next and previous page of a student.

180
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Submission, press the period and comicies to go up and down the question outline for the same student press, a to view a listable of all students emissions for a given question

181
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:44,000
So I just offer that as a way to also increase the efficiency of your grading is with the keyboard Shortcuts

182
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Whenever we encounter the same mistake again, we can grade especially quickly.

183
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Okay.

184
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:11,000
And so in those past 2 examples they are grading manually they're going next, and next, and looking at each student's answer and grading accordingly, which is totally fine that's what we're used to But this example is

185
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,000
going to showcase how the Ai assisted grading and answer.

186
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Grouping can work with this the same. The questions on the same exam

187
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:36,000
In this video we'll take a look at the ai assisted greeting and manual answer grouping tools which are part of our great scope.

188
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Complete products. let's go to the great submissions Tab and click on a question.

189
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,000
We select form answer groups first. and Now we're prompted to mark the question type.

190
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:57,000
This question is multiple choice. We click, review, answer groups and the great scope's, Ai processes, all of the student submissions, integrated groups of similar answers.

191
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Here the Ai found 6 groups. If we want, we can give each group a title merge.

192
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:12,000
It with another group or delete the group let's click and double check that all the answers are the same.

193
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
So this group looks good. We confirm if there was any answered.

194
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:22,000
It didn't belong. We would just hover over it and press the space bar to remove it from the group.

195
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Let's go through and confirm all of our other groups

196
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,000
All right now. all of our groups are confirmed. Here we see the one answer that we removed earlier.

197
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:44,000
We can assign this answer back to the correct group by clicking and dragging it now over dung grouping, and we can click great answers.

198
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
We see that we're now creating the first group which has 4 submissions.

199
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Groups will appear in order of group size, with the group that has the most submissions appearing first.

200
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Here we see a sample answer from the group. If we wanted to edit the group, we could click on the group name here, and if we wanted to view all the submissions in this group or grade any submission separately, we could

201
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:12,000
click on submissions here. This answer is partially incorrect, so we mark that accordingly.

202
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Now when we click next that rubric item that we just created is automatically applied to all the other 3 submissions in Group one, we can now go through and grade the rest of the groups

203
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,000
And that's it would only a few clicks we just created 20 submissions.

204
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Let's try grouping and grading another question this question is a fill in the blink math question, where students wrote a mathematical response in a fixed answer.

205
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Region like a boxer line. Here the Ai sorted, all student answers into 2 groups.

206
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:58,000
If the groupings ever seem inaccurate we can improve the Ai's accuracy by editing the location of the final answer area which would reprocess the groups.

207
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:10,000
In this case, however, it seems that the ai did a good job, and we can quickly review these 2 groups to confirm Now that we've confirmed those 2 groups, we can see that there were 4 answers that couldn't be

208
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:17,000
grouped we can drag and drop this 20 into group one and We can put these 2 blink answers into a new group.

209
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Let's leave this one answer ungrouped when we click great answers.

210
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,000
We'll see that we'll be grading 3 groups followed by one ungrouped answer.

211
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:32,000
So we can quickly go through and greed

212
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Here's that one ungroup submission at the end and we're done with this question.

213
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Finally, if we want to create a question that does not match one of the suggested question types such as this geography question, we can select manual grouping.

214
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:53,000
We can now look through all the submissions and group similar ones together ourselves.

215
00:30:53,000 --> 00:31:01,000
So let's select all the ones that have self dakota shaded, then click, create a group and give it a name.

216
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Let's create a few more groups

217
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
From the and menu. Here we have the option to edit the group.

218
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Name merge 2 or more groups together or delete a group and that's it.

219
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Once we're done grouping we can proceed to grading each group just as we did earlier.

220
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:44,000
In this video we'll take a look at the ai any questions about how that grading works

221
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Does it seem like It makes sense

222
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Excellent. I will admit this is my my first training session on it, so I don't know if my thought process is clear.

223
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Thanks, Rosina. This video we'll take a look at the ais.

224
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:26,000
So I thought we could walk through the setup of an assignment.

225
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:35,000
And kind of how they created that assignment that they graded.

226
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:46,000
So if any other questions pop up, feel free to put those in the chat and rearrange my menus here.

227
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,000
So we're gonna use that document. but I think I have it downloaded already.

228
00:32:51,000 --> 00:33:15,000
I am going to start in canvas

229
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:23,000
So, as we mentioned, you would start in canvas in the assignments area, so there may already be an assignment.

230
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:31,000
If you're just changing that submission type to so that you can grade it in grade scope instead of grading it here in speed.

231
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Greater. But let me i'll need a new assignment for this case

232
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Right. i'll do 5 points my assignment group mainly the assignment group is important.

233
00:33:52,000 --> 00:34:09,000
If the grades are being weighted, based on those assignment groups I can display as points, because the last time chemist tends to remember the last time you set up an assignment and What format that was and so it

234
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:20,000
has remembered that I was using external tools before, but i'll click that dropdown no submission online on paper or external tool.

235
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:33,000
And so when we do file attachment that would be online and here's where you can do text entry url media recording file upload

236
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,000
I'm an use this fine button to search through the tools again.

237
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:47,000
They're an alphabetical order and i'm looking for grade scope.

238
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I always set mind to load in a new tab. You can set the due date for the assignment the same way.

239
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:04,000
It would be, and I can save or i'll go ahead and save and publish.

240
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,000
I skipped over the step where I give instructions to students.

241
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:17,000
But for those of you who are in the Brazilian teaching session this morning, I would encourage you to go ahead and fill in those instructions.

242
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:25,000
If there's any resources they need what resources are they able to use to complete this assignment, you know, is this quiz Closed book?

243
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Or is it open? note? I'm. just trying to jump ahead because these external tools?

244
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Instead of having the you know, start submission button like a canvas assignment, does it'll say, load the assignment in a new window.

245
00:35:45,000 --> 00:36:01,000
And so when I click on that the first time you click on it, there's some setup steps and so

246
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:07,000
I believe I already have a grade Scope course an old one.

247
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:16,000
See if I can find it or i'll just create a new one

248
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:21,000
That linking to canvas is what is going to pass.

249
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:31,000
The students roster information and allow them to basically log in through canvas and link their u of M account.

250
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,000
And it's also going to give us that grade pass back feature.

251
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:47,000
So you do always want to link those again here's some initial setup steps

252
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Here's where you can set your default scoring method do you do negative scoring.

253
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:58,000
So I'm going to deduct as I go am I gonna do positive scoring.

254
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Give students credit one by one for everything They did right i'm gonna leave it to the negative scoring.

255
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:16,000
And so this is basically setting defaults. for all assignments. But you'll have options to adjust these for specific assignments as well default score bounds.

256
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Is there a ceiling? The maximum score is determined by the point value set on the assignment?

257
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Or can I give students extra credit so i'm just going to leave that option opened where I could give students bonus points if I wanted?

258
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:39,000
And is there a floor Is 0 the lowest I can go?

259
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Or am I gonna give students negative points. I don't see a reason to give students negative points.

260
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:51,000
So i'm not gonna do that i'm going to update the course.

261
00:37:51,000 --> 00:38:02,000
And so here on the left hand side, I have a great scope dashboard, and I still have canvas open in this tab up here.

262
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Great scope has opened in a separate tab have my list of assignments, and so students will have these 2 options.

263
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:37,000
But because i'm the instructor I can also see the roster can see any extra extensions, and this would be a good students additional time on any time assignment I haven't worked with that quite yet just because a lot

264
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:43,000
of the things I've worked with so far in great scope are the work on this, on your own time, you know.

265
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Work on this word document, fill in your answers and submit it before the deadline, and then I can always revisit those course settings.

266
00:38:52,000 --> 00:39:02,000
If I had other graders in my course they would appear here, so i'm going to go to the dashboard.

267
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Because it allows me to create assignment right from here.

268
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:14,000
I can also go to my assignments page and create a new assignment.

269
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,000
I also have the ability to duplicate an assignment.

270
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:24,000
So if I have a repeating assignment, I can set one up and then duplicate it so.

271
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:35,000
And then just change the due date, for instance, or maybe some of the instructions, but leaving a lot of the settings the same additionally with duplicate assignment.

272
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:43,000
I can copy assignments over from another course so maybe there's a couple of us assignments that are being reused from last year.

273
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:48,000
We could import them. if you have access to last year's grade scope.

274
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Course I should say so. same is on the dashboard.

275
00:39:52,000 --> 00:40:11,000
I have the ability to create a new assignment we talked about the different assignment types, and so for this I'm going to follow their example of a quiz

276
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:19,000
And this means it's going to sent me up to create the predefined regions where

277
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,000
So here's a quick example of the homework problem set notice.

278
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:34,000
They have a student working on paper in there in this case of the homework problem set. I do have the ability to create predefined regions.

279
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:39,000
So I've worked on, set up a couple where students are and still answering, in a word, document.

280
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
And if they decide to, you know, write things out by hand.

281
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:50,000
That would be fine, or if they just work in word, they could do that as well, and I set predefined regions.

282
00:40:50,000 --> 00:41:08,000
I left space for students to answer in the word document only because when I set those predefined templates, i'll soon have to do is upload or scan and upload the image files.

283
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:16,000
When I submit something like this, where students it could be any number of pages.

284
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:34,000
In any order. Students have to do one additional step and that's. They have to tell Grade Scope where the answer to question one is where the the answer to question 2 is which is fine great scope.

285
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Makes it really easy to where all you have to say is question.

286
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:46,000
One is on page one question, 2 is on page one question, 3 is on page 2, so it can be quick, or it can be slow.

287
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:58,000
If it's a really long assignment so that's just something to keep in mind and that's something I'm usually keeping in mind also when I build assignments is how to tricky is it going to

288
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:05,000
be for students to submit this and giving them that information up top.

289
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:22,000
You're going to upload and you're going to align? what page each question is on, and grade Scope has some tutorial information for on that that can be shared with students here's an example of

290
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:29,000
a bubble sheet here's an example of what a programming assignment would look like.

291
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:38,000
So this looks like a python file, and it displays it in a code format, and a greater.

292
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:53,000
An instructor can leave comments in line in the code and score with that same grading rubric that we saw when grading the exact. and then the online assignment.

293
00:42:53,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Lets you kind of create almost like a canvas quiz type thing

294
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:10,000
This should be on your account it says it's in beta I've played around with it a little bit, and it's pretty nice.

295
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:19,000
So anyway, i'm gonna jump to exam quiz and click next

296
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Wait. I I named that quiz one quiz one I'm gonna give it a name, and the template. you always have to, I guess, with the exception of a programming assignment an online assignment you always have

297
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:39,000
to upload a template file and so even if students aren't referencing.

298
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:44,000
This I could upload a blank. Pdf. but I have to for some reason attach a Pdf.

299
00:43:44,000 --> 00:44:01,000
But in this case we are using a template

300
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Sorry I don't remember where I saved this there it is all right.

301
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:17,000
So this is kind of that same exam document they had. Do I want to enable anonymous grading?

302
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:22,000
So this is an option. hiding, identifiable student information.

303
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:42,000
However, if students write their name anywhere on the paper, you would see that you can designate who's going to upload the submissions, and so grade scope is asking, Do I give an upload button to students or not so

304
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:48,000
we'll say student, and then you can set the date parameter so similar to it in canvas.

305
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,000
How I can set the availability. When can students start looking at this?

306
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:58,000
When is it due

307
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:04,000
We'll say i'll get more time

308
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:15,000
And then, will you allow late submissions or not?

309
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:25,000
They set a time limit which again I haven't yet seen a a use case for.

310
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:32,000
But just know that it is an option, particularly if maybe you were utilizing the online assignment as a quiz.

311
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:44,000
In this case the time limit It's going to sort of restrict how long this Pdf is available that template.

312
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:54,000
So submission type Again, is it variable length? Are students going to be submitting different lengths, documents where they need to designate?

313
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:02,000
We? which question is located on which page or is it a template fixed length, and i'm going to tell grade scope where to look for each answer.

314
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:09,000
So in this case we're going to say templated here's that group submission.

315
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Maybe some students will do this in groups, and some will do it individually.

316
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Do I want to give that option? Yes, or no again when we talked about groups?

317
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:27,000
It's not required but it gives students an option and then building your rubric the things you're going to deduct for.

318
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Do you want to do that in advance? because you already know what you're looking for?

319
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Or do you want to wait and do that while you're grading submissions, just to see what types of answers you get, and then template visibility?

320
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Allow students to view and download the template. Do you want them writing on this one, or do you?

321
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Are you going to hand it out in class for instance, this also comes into play, because sometimes I need to upload a Pdf to grade scope to, you know, make great scope happy.

322
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:06,000
But i'm going to give a word document to my students that they can edit easier than a pdf.

323
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:22,000
So maybe I would restrict that because over here in the assignment instructions, I'm gonna attach a word, Doc, that they can download and edit. so kind of just thinking through how students are going how the whole process and

324
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:34,000
workflow is going to go and i'm gonna create this assignment

325
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:39,000
So for the assignment I get to create my grading outline.

326
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:43,000
And what they mean is, what items are you grading?

327
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:50,000
What are the questions? Great Scope wants to know where the questions are, and this document has a name.

328
00:47:50,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Section, so I can create a name region, and what I can do is drag these boxes

329
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:16,000
And in this case there's also an Id region and i'm clicking on it, because they created that in their document

330
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Your documents may not have that, or you may not need it.

331
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:38,000
So question one. well, 1 point, one, Cal. Thank youless. Oh, boy.

332
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Alright, so I don't need this all the way but i'm, grabbing the edges and trying to align it anywhere.

333
00:48:51,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Students may answer, and just for myself, i'm including the question title

334
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:19,000
So this one I have a 1.2 calculus and So when it comes to analytics, i'm going to be able to get analytics on each of these sections.

335
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:36,000
I create in this outline

336
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
So this they should be pretty much drawing on the map.

337
00:49:39,000 --> 00:50:09,000
So I don't need to go too far outside the bounds

338
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:15,000
I didn't mean to create that one so i'm gonna hit the delete on there.

339
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:24,000
I'm trying to modify this one

340
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:38,000
And this one they'll be marking a multiple choice

341
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:44,000
And so I have created the assignment i've edited the outline.

342
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:50,000
It has skipped the create rubric step because I set i'll do that later, when i'm actually grading submissions.

343
00:50:50,000 --> 00:51:02,000
And so now, if's in the managed submission step as students submit, I would see their names here, and when they submitted.

344
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:08,000
I'm going to jump back up to the edit outline

345
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:16,000
To see. This is what my designations are going to be, and I could come in here and edit this also.

346
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:32,000
So i've made one per question but I could have done sub groups as well

347
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:41,000
So i'm going to jump to an example

348
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Alright. and so actually now i'm back on my dashboard and the assignments they look pretty similar

349
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:58,000
I can see when this is due, and this is kind of gonna work as like a countdown almost.

350
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Let me jump back over to assignments because this was set to be worth 5 points, and I didn't show you that as I was building the outline.

351
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,000
But maybe you saw it because I was busy making my boxes.

352
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:24,000
But you may have noticed that you can set the point value for each of these questions over here

353
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,000
So as a student, I would come in here click on this.

354
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:32,000
And so, instead of being taken to the grating side, as I am an instructor, it would tell.

355
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Give me an upload button

356
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:47,000
And then, because the instructor has already designated what sections the answer should be in, I can jump

357
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:57,000
I can be done. Basically, it would tag mine as submitted

358
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:10,000
I'm gonna jump over i'm looking for another course so let's go into that great scope 101 the way they

359
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:16,000
So grade submissions. Yes, alright. So yeah, they use those subcategories. Calculus.

360
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:24,000
1.1 and 1.2 so let's look at that

361
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:34,000
And so notice it is zooming in to that question based on how the outline was set up.

362
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:39,000
I can expand this to the full page where you can kind of see

363
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:49,000
The larger picture call pages. It shows that it's a 2 page exam.

364
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Question only in full page. I didn't show you the advanced video, because it was kind of long.

365
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,000
But this is where comments the comments are.

366
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:11,000
How So as you leave comments or other graders leave comments, it's going to get collected in this previously used comments.

367
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Dropbox, so so that you can all share comments again, creating a consistent, grading experience across multiple graders

368
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Any questions about using grade scope, or how to go about getting started.

369
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:43,000
I will offer again our team to help. I think there's a lot of classes and assignments where this could be really useful, collaborating across multiple graders.

370
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:54,000
And so it would be my pleasure to help you get set up in any courses that you think your instructor would be open to trying this from an instructor perspective.

371
00:54:54,000 --> 00:55:03,000
If they are not the ones doing the grading they may be more open to it, because they don't have to learn a new tool. it would be on you to learn the new tool.

372
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:16,000
And again i'd be happy to support you and it's going to push those grades back to their grade book where they can see them

373
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Here again, here is our email address as ph instruction at Youish Edu.

374
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:39,000
So as you're looking at your courses and see use cases where these types of exercises might be helpful Some things to look for might be having a lot of graders and wanting to create that consistency one might be if you're

375
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:47,000
doing anything by hand. having that scan and ai group answer grouping for things that are.

376
00:55:47,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Maybe there's only one correct answer can be really helpful and just reusing those comments for me as a big selling feature

377
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Right.

378
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:16,000
So that is it for the great scope training we ended just a few minutes early.

379
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:21,000
If there's any questions that come to mind feel free to pop those into the chat.

380
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:34,000
My toolbar there. we go so i'll stop this recording but we'll happy to address any questions in the chat, or follow up with them afterward.

381
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:48,000
I will send out a message later, today or tomorrow. With the rating of this and any additional resources for grade, scope and canvas and the tools we talked about. The next session.

382
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:59,104
We have coming up is going to be at one o'clock.
