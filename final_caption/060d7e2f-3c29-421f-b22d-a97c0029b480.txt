1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:05,629
Hey everyone, this is my second quick review video, and

2
00:00:05,629 --> 00:00:10,640
this will be about the second lecture, digestion and absorption.

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,567
So again, I'll be coming through the lecture real quick,

4
00:00:16,567 --> 00:00:19,891
so this is the elementary canal.

5
00:00:19,891 --> 00:00:25,627
So basically the whole digestive tract, we have different organs that a system that

6
00:00:25,627 --> 00:00:30,811
there are different layers the lumen the which is like the innermost for it.

7
00:00:30,811 --> 00:00:34,688
And then the mucosa, sub mucosa, muscularis externa, and

8
00:00:34,688 --> 00:00:37,520
serosa, which will be talking more about.

9
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,720
So the mucosa is the epithelial lining,

10
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:45,151
it's sorry, I mean it consists of those three layers.

11
00:00:45,151 --> 00:00:49,814
The epithelial lining, the lining appropriate muscularis its mucosa which

12
00:00:49,814 --> 00:00:52,630
all each one of those has different function.

13
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:56,559
And then there's the sub mucosa which is like the second layer,

14
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,635
the second major layer, muscularia externa and then the serosa,

15
00:01:00,635 --> 00:01:05,340
which is the outermost layer of the whole canal.

16
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,716
So those are the three sub layer of the epithelium lining is important for

17
00:01:08,716 --> 00:01:10,450
exocrine and endocrine functions.

18
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:15,334
So you can imagine that all of these secretions that are being released

19
00:01:15,334 --> 00:01:19,309
into your digestive tract to promote either digestion or

20
00:01:19,309 --> 00:01:23,740
change acidity or so on, would be in the epithelial lining.

21
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:29,200
And then the mucosa has the gut associated lymphoid tissues,

22
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,191
so it's important for the immune function.

23
00:01:33,191 --> 00:01:37,447
And that's a second layer, the lamina propria, and then the last layer is for

24
00:01:37,447 --> 00:01:41,643
the twitching movement because all throughout the digestive tract there's

25
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:46,000
peristaltic movement and you need food to keep moving and to be turned and so on.

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,750
So the muscularis mucosa plays a major role in that,

27
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:54,355
the second major layer, the sub mucosa has the blood vessels and

28
00:01:54,355 --> 00:01:57,950
the plexus of meissner, which is important for.

29
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:03,074
It has a network of nerves and it controls secretions as well and

30
00:02:03,074 --> 00:02:09,190
regulates blood flow, the muscularis external, the third outer layer.

31
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:13,506
It's also important for peristalsis in muscle movement and

32
00:02:13,506 --> 00:02:17,831
the serosa which is the last one, it just provides support.

33
00:02:17,831 --> 00:02:23,423
So think of the serosa as being the outermost layer and it's really important

34
00:02:23,423 --> 00:02:30,840
to support the whole system and to keep all of the chunks together.

35
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,271
So we have neural endocrine regulation of

36
00:02:35,271 --> 00:02:39,970
the digestive track and how we digest food.

37
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:44,432
So there is the central nervous system that senses the food,

38
00:02:44,432 --> 00:02:47,160
smell the taste, the site and so on.

39
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:51,095
And there's neural regulation of digestion, so the sympathetic

40
00:02:51,095 --> 00:02:55,820
nervous system would be when you feel in danger or you're frightened and so on.

41
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:59,770
And that would limit secretions into the digestive tract,

42
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:03,411
because digestion is not your priority at the moment.

43
00:03:03,411 --> 00:03:07,582
It's more of the fight or flight reflex, that's more at play, versus

44
00:03:07,582 --> 00:03:12,589
the parasympathetic nervous system, which is when you're more relaxed and you're

45
00:03:12,589 --> 00:03:17,490
allowing your digestive tract to act the way it's supposed to and digestive food.

46
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:22,246
Which would mean that there is more digestive secretions and

47
00:03:22,246 --> 00:03:25,510
the muscles are being relaxed to allow for

48
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:31,940
the natural movement of food along the track.

49
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:36,279
So those are the hormones that are being produced, so gastric and the stomach,

50
00:03:36,279 --> 00:03:39,909
it stimulates gastric motility and secretion of gastric juice and

51
00:03:39,909 --> 00:03:42,020
it would increased motility of food.

52
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:45,445
Basically, secretin is released in the small intestine,

53
00:03:45,445 --> 00:03:47,301
it inhibits gastric motility.

54
00:03:47,301 --> 00:03:52,376
So think of secretin and as being produced in response

55
00:03:52,376 --> 00:03:57,470
to the kind that's being released from the stomach.

56
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:01,786
So the stomach is emptying all its contents into the small intestine and so

57
00:04:01,786 --> 00:04:03,811
secretin just put a brake on that.

58
00:04:03,811 --> 00:04:06,923
And asks the stomach to slow down because it doesn't want to

59
00:04:06,923 --> 00:04:09,440
be overwhelmed with all of the food coming in.

60
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:15,940
So it will inhibit gastric motility and reduce the gastric efficiency just so

61
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:20,640
that it takes it more easy on the small intestine.

62
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:24,494
The CCK is also released in the small intestine and

63
00:04:24,494 --> 00:04:28,899
it stimulates the release of bile, bile is important for

64
00:04:28,899 --> 00:04:33,051
forming bile cells and kind of breaking down fats.

65
00:04:33,051 --> 00:04:34,818
So keep that in mind and

66
00:04:34,818 --> 00:04:42,940
it stimulates pancreatic enzyme released two SS digestion.

67
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:48,530
So this is someone who has occurred that was covered in class and

68
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:52,030
then the oral cavity and the the mouth.

69
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:56,878
You have the first mechanical and chemical digestion because chemical

70
00:04:56,878 --> 00:05:01,331
digestion would mean that there is a natural chemical reaction.

71
00:05:01,331 --> 00:05:03,210
So enzymes are at play and

72
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:08,140
the enzyme you release in the mouth is of the salivary amylase.

73
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:12,719
And then there's also mechanical digestion because you are churning the food and

74
00:05:12,719 --> 00:05:13,600
masticating.

75
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,171
Which means that there's an actual physical breakdown

76
00:05:18,171 --> 00:05:24,540
of the food that's triggered by force and not enzymes.

77
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:29,883
So it's worth mentioning also that the salivary glands that are releasing

78
00:05:29,883 --> 00:05:34,973
these salivary amylase, salivary amylase works on carbohydrates and

79
00:05:34,973 --> 00:05:38,650
it breaks them down into smaller carbs basically.

80
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:40,419
But this doesn't last long, and

81
00:05:40,419 --> 00:05:43,966
it really depends on how long you're actually showing your food.

82
00:05:43,966 --> 00:05:48,006
But there's also lingual glands that release lingual lipase,

83
00:05:48,006 --> 00:05:52,792
which is inactive because lipids breakdown does not occur in the mouth yet,

84
00:05:52,792 --> 00:05:59,740
but it doesn't occur yet, and it definitely does not occur in the mouth.

85
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:02,411
And then when you swallow the food,

86
00:06:02,411 --> 00:06:07,487
the epiglottis is supposed to shift backwards to block the airway so

87
00:06:07,487 --> 00:06:13,300
that the food does not go into the airway but instead goes into the esophagus.

88
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:18,033
The way it's supposed to go over here, actually,

89
00:06:18,033 --> 00:06:26,540
if that fails to happen then you're at risk of choking and suffocation.

90
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:30,267
And so the esophagus really is just like a quick pathway,

91
00:06:30,267 --> 00:06:34,851
the food just goes in there, there's paracletic movement that keeps

92
00:06:34,851 --> 00:06:38,940
pushing the food downwards and it's really strong.

93
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:42,976
And then the stomach, the stomach is really interesting,

94
00:06:42,976 --> 00:06:47,671
it has some gastric pits and the pits release different secretions.

95
00:06:47,671 --> 00:06:53,429
So in the stomach you have those four types of plants that are inside the pits,

96
00:06:53,429 --> 00:06:58,670
the endocrine glands, they released, their regulatory hormones.

97
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:03,884
Like gastrin to and the appetite hormone ghrelin which would make

98
00:07:03,884 --> 00:07:09,094
you want to eat more and gastrin which would make you not want to eat

99
00:07:09,094 --> 00:07:14,118
as much because you just ate basically the mucous neck releases

100
00:07:14,118 --> 00:07:19,540
the mucus to keep the food lubricated and moving nicely in there.

101
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:23,367
The parietal cells, they're really important,

102
00:07:23,367 --> 00:07:28,630
they released the HCL which is why the stomach has very acidic medium.

103
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:35,413
And the HCL works to activate pepsinogen which is released by the chief cells,

104
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:39,626
and it becomes activated in the form of pepsins so

105
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:44,140
pepsinogen is the inactive enzyme basically.

106
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:48,859
And so when it's activated it can break down proteins which is very important

107
00:07:48,859 --> 00:07:52,070
when you consume and a meal that's rich in protein.

108
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:55,732
And this is exactly what I said again, so

109
00:07:55,732 --> 00:08:01,443
just think if you have a deficiency in one of those secretions,

110
00:08:01,443 --> 00:08:06,010
how would that affect your digestion basically?

111
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:10,782
So and the small intestine that you start with the duodenum and

112
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:16,196
then jejunum and ileum is the last part that's closest to the colon and

113
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:23,040
the main site of digestion and absorption is the small intestine.

114
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:27,653
So as soon as the chyme gets into the small intestine Brunner's glands

115
00:08:27,653 --> 00:08:32,840
become active and they secrete bicarbonate to neutralize the medium.

116
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:37,828
It's kind of basic at the bicarbonate over here it's 8-9,

117
00:08:37,828 --> 00:08:42,344
but the food coming from the stomach is highly acidic, so

118
00:08:42,344 --> 00:08:47,040
this helps and almost neutralizing it.

119
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,126
The macro nutrient absorption is in the jejunum, and then there's

120
00:08:51,126 --> 00:08:58,140
further absorption towards the end [COUGH] along with bile recirculation.

121
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:01,334
And so the structure of the small intestine,

122
00:09:01,334 --> 00:09:04,611
since there is a lot of absorption over there,

123
00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:09,904
you need a structure that can really tolerate the massive intake of food and

124
00:09:09,904 --> 00:09:15,410
really absorb the macro and micronutrients at the very high efficiency.

125
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:19,590
And so for that reason we have the Villi and

126
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:23,770
the brush border which will talk about and

127
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:28,921
let me finally picture, I can use this one in here.

128
00:09:28,921 --> 00:09:34,259
So the lumen is where the food is and then this is the outer layers the mucosa and

129
00:09:34,259 --> 00:09:36,910
then the serosa all the way on the out.

130
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:42,580
And basically you have to Villi over here that are like this and

131
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:45,743
they increase the surface area and

132
00:09:45,743 --> 00:09:50,680
allow for maximum absorption of food and nutrients.

133
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:56,153
And then past those Villi and passed the brush boards or there is either blood

134
00:09:56,153 --> 00:10:02,071
vessels and there is lacteals which will be talking about this is the entire site.

135
00:10:02,071 --> 00:10:08,271
So we'll talk more about this, so people who might suffer from celiac disease,

136
00:10:08,271 --> 00:10:13,121
celiac diseases, autoimmune and it will damage their Valli.

137
00:10:13,121 --> 00:10:17,951
So this is the picture of a normal Valli, this is the brush border the entire side,

138
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:20,770
like apical membrane, the lateral membrane.

139
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:24,498
And then someone who has celiac disease does not have those nice projections for

140
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:25,140
the Valli.

141
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:31,086
So since the Valli contain enzymes that aid and carbohydrate and

142
00:10:31,086 --> 00:10:36,593
protein digestion, having a ruined Valli or an inactive or

143
00:10:36,593 --> 00:10:44,140
destroyed Valli basically would impair digestion of carbs and proteins.

144
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:48,517
So the answer to this, iclicker was compromised suggestion because the Valli

145
00:10:48,517 --> 00:10:52,827
by themselves, the brush border by itself, actually not just the Valli have

146
00:10:52,827 --> 00:10:58,940
a lot of enzymes that are necessary to complete digestion.

147
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:02,568
Then Pancreatic juice is important as well,

148
00:11:02,568 --> 00:11:06,581
it has bicarbonate to maximize enzyme activity.

149
00:11:06,581 --> 00:11:11,394
Since the pancreatic juice is being produced in the small intestine

150
00:11:11,394 --> 00:11:14,280
where the environment is more neutral.

151
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:18,709
So it neutralizes the acidic chyme, and

152
00:11:18,709 --> 00:11:24,451
it also helps, and it also releases alpha amylase.

153
00:11:24,451 --> 00:11:28,855
I believe I forgot to mention that alpha amylase that was produced initially from

154
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:29,520
the mouth.

155
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:33,844
The salivary amylase becomes deactivated within a few

156
00:11:33,844 --> 00:11:37,981
minutes to half an hour when it reaches the stomach.

157
00:11:37,981 --> 00:11:43,205
So basically the stomach is not a major a place for carb digestion because the alpha

158
00:11:43,205 --> 00:11:48,000
amylase that's being released from the mouth gets deactivated quickly.

159
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,151
So you need to think of it as the mouth initiates the carbohydrate digestion,

160
00:11:53,151 --> 00:11:57,985
it's then stopped in the stomach and then it's resumed back in the small

161
00:11:57,985 --> 00:12:04,940
intestine by the activity of the pancreatic alpha amylase.

162
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:09,611
Then those are the hormones we've discussed earlier [COUGH] and

163
00:12:09,611 --> 00:12:14,457
then the liver synthesizes bile, so bile is really important for

164
00:12:14,457 --> 00:12:19,740
fat digestion and it's stored in the gallbladder.

165
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:25,142
Basically this is how it happens, you have lipids that become emulsified and

166
00:12:25,142 --> 00:12:29,961
then kind of broken down into smaller pieces and surrounded by bile so

167
00:12:29,961 --> 00:12:34,650
that they form bile cells and then they can cross the brush border.

168
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:40,422
So there's still big molecules but they're kind of smaller than what we started with,

169
00:12:40,422 --> 00:12:44,840
which is really important to allow for their absorption.

170
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:50,840
The therapeutic circulation is basically recycling of the bile salt,

171
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:57,040
so the bile that like the leftover bile goes back to the through the hepatic

172
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:06,540
portal vein, to the liver is recycled and sent back to the gall bladder.

173
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:10,503
And then whatever bile is not recycled basically and

174
00:13:10,503 --> 00:13:12,860
is actually lost in the feces.

175
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:15,718
Then deliver will have to compensate for that and

176
00:13:15,718 --> 00:13:23,240
produce that same amount to make up for the lost bile.

177
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:27,346
So transport would happen across the apical membrane, so

178
00:13:27,346 --> 00:13:33,378
goes through the Valli, apical membrane, it's inside the terror sites over here,

179
00:13:33,378 --> 00:13:36,511
and then it will cross the second membrane.

180
00:13:36,511 --> 00:13:40,917
And now the food can go to either the blood vessels or

181
00:13:40,917 --> 00:13:47,840
the lymph vessels depending on their size and their nature.

182
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,874
And so definitely have passive diffusion or

183
00:13:50,874 --> 00:13:56,340
a carrier mediated diffusion which can be either facilitated or active.

184
00:13:56,340 --> 00:14:00,894
So passive would be down your concentration gradients, so if an area

185
00:14:00,894 --> 00:14:05,700
A has very high concentration in the area B has a very low concentration.

186
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:09,706
Passive diffusion would entitle that the food and

187
00:14:09,706 --> 00:14:14,949
area A where there is high concentration will naturally go to area

188
00:14:14,949 --> 00:14:20,220
B until it kind of reaches homeostasis in like a natural balance.

189
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,644
Where as this is by carriers and

190
00:14:22,644 --> 00:14:27,029
does not follow a gradient basically if it's active but

191
00:14:27,029 --> 00:14:33,210
it can't follow a gradient if it's facilitated but it still needs a carrier.

192
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:37,306
So those are two different mechanisms or

193
00:14:37,306 --> 00:14:44,540
engulfing the nutrients is the third one.

194
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:48,416
Okay, and then for lipids we did mention that there is blood vessels or

195
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:52,701
lymph vessels for lipids that are too large for caterpillars to handle them.

196
00:14:52,701 --> 00:14:56,560
They go through the lac deals and then lymph vessels,

197
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:02,654
whereas smaller products will go through the blood vessels like monosaccharides,

198
00:15:02,654 --> 00:15:05,430
and proteins in the large intestine.

199
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:10,081
The colon has micro that help in fermenting some fibers

200
00:15:10,081 --> 00:15:13,124
which will be talking about later.

201
00:15:13,124 --> 00:15:19,504
But there's also like maximum absorption of water along with that cells and

202
00:15:19,504 --> 00:15:24,200
other secretions from digestive tract, for example.

203
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:29,412
The bile that may have not been recycled and may have not gone through

204
00:15:29,412 --> 00:15:34,534
the entire pathetic recycling because microflora will be talking

205
00:15:34,534 --> 00:15:39,400
more about this during the microbiome lecture and that was it.

206
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,035
I hope this helps.
