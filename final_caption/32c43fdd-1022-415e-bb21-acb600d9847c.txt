1
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:10,560
In this module we'll be providing

2
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,605
an overview of some approaches
to system thinking.

3
00:00:13,605 --> 00:00:15,150
Now in a previous module I

4
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,830
mentioned that systems
thinking gives us

5
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,750
some pretty powerful tools and

6
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,780
methods and theories to
approach public health.

7
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,130
But you may be wondering well,

8
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,320
how would I go about
selecting some of these?

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,260
So in this module we'll be
focusing on some that are

10
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,995
particularly relevant to
issues in public health.

11
00:00:31,995 --> 00:00:34,275
The first theory we'll talk about

12
00:00:34,275 --> 00:00:36,260
is path dependency theory,

13
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:37,880
and this theory basically seeks

14
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,620
to explain why processes with

15
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,230
very similar starting
points can still lead to

16
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:45,715
different outcomes even if
they follow the same rules.

17
00:00:45,715 --> 00:00:48,110
I have provided an
image here to try to

18
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:51,050
highlight this notion
of path dependency and

19
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:54,680
the fact that outcomes in
many systems are sensitive to

20
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,970
the initial conditions or

21
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:57,830
the starting conditions as

22
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:59,830
well as choices
made along the way.

23
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:01,550
So if you imagine a worker at

24
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:03,050
the bottom of the image
you're looking at

25
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:04,970
here trying to decide how

26
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:07,320
long they should continue
working in their career,

27
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,320
there's a bunch of
different paths they can

28
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,095
take and a lot of different
influencing factors.

29
00:01:12,095 --> 00:01:13,655
So one is, there may be

30
00:01:13,655 --> 00:01:15,770
a push for them to stay
in the workforce from

31
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:17,810
their employers who need

32
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:20,095
them to complete
a very vital job,

33
00:01:20,095 --> 00:01:21,650
there may be a pull for them to

34
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:23,090
leave the workforce though,

35
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:25,400
the siren call of welfare.

36
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,920
The state plays a
role here and setting

37
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,289
social policies around retirement

38
00:01:30,289 --> 00:01:32,630
and also collective
bargaining agreements.

39
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:35,930
There are different pathways
that workers can take

40
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:39,620
to have an early exit from
the workforce or to stay,

41
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,720
and there's issues
around labor relations

42
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,030
between the employer, the worker,

43
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:47,540
a trade union if they
belong to one, a council,

44
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,400
for example regionally focused on

45
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,460
a particular type of work
and employer associations.

46
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,935
So all of these factors play into

47
00:01:54,935 --> 00:01:57,319
that individual workers decision

48
00:01:57,319 --> 00:02:00,145
to stay in the workforce or not.

49
00:02:00,145 --> 00:02:03,340
For each of these theories and
tools I'm going to provide

50
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,860
you an example of a study
that's actually applied to.

51
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,300
So here's an example of where

52
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,610
path dependency
theory was applied.

53
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:11,980
This was a study that
did an analysis of

54
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,525
public health spending in

55
00:02:13,525 --> 00:02:16,825
18 so-called rich or
high-income countries.

56
00:02:16,825 --> 00:02:18,910
They model the
relationship between

57
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,760
the public share of health
care spending for each of

58
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,055
these countries back in 1960

59
00:02:24,055 --> 00:02:26,020
and then looking at
the public share in

60
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,030
2010 and trying to understand

61
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:31,440
why did that public
share change over time.

62
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,280
So they looked at

63
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,630
several different predictors and

64
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,490
had two competing hypotheses.

65
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,680
One was self-reinforcing,
such that

66
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,050
positive feedbacks would actually

67
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:43,780
promote their percentage
of the public shares spent

68
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,520
on healthcare or a
counteracting hypothesis

69
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,755
basically there would be
negative feedbacks and

70
00:02:48,755 --> 00:02:50,900
increased spending
initially would lead

71
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,450
to subsequent declines
in public share.

72
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:56,360
So I don't want to focus on
the particular results here

73
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,590
because this is not a course

74
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:59,390
on public health care spending,

75
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:01,775
but I do want to highlight
the fact that they considered

76
00:03:01,775 --> 00:03:04,310
a lot of different
potential influences

77
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:06,560
on the path that public
health care spending

78
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,530
could take,things like
gross domestic product,

79
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:13,465
deindustrialization,
inflation, unemployment,

80
00:03:13,465 --> 00:03:15,920
openness of these
countries to trade and the

81
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,980
fraction of the population
over the age of 64,

82
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:21,980
and they determined that
all of these things had

83
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:25,294
some influence but in fact
the greatest predictor

84
00:03:25,294 --> 00:03:28,790
of variation in public health
care spending was simply

85
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:32,600
that initial value that
each country spent in 1960.

86
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,850
So a very complicated analysis,

87
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:37,400
considering lots of very
high level variables

88
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,540
but ultimately trying to

89
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:41,630
decide a way to
explain how countries

90
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,800
proceed on the path that they

91
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,440
do in terms of
supporting health care.

92
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,230
So the second theory I'd
like to introduce you

93
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:50,705
to is one called
agent-based modeling.

94
00:03:50,705 --> 00:03:53,270
An agent-based modeling
like a lot of systems

95
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:56,030
thinking tools involves
a virtual representation

96
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,715
of some complex system.

97
00:03:57,715 --> 00:03:59,615
So we're going to
model individual

98
00:03:59,615 --> 00:04:01,040
agents in that system who

99
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,690
can interact with each other and

100
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:04,570
with the environment around them,

101
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:06,470
and in agent-based modeling we

102
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,720
actually constrained
the decisions

103
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,490
that these agents
can make based on

104
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:13,340
a simple set of predefined rules.

105
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:16,890
So here's an example of an
agent-based modeling study,

106
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,770
this is a busy figure
that we're looking at.

107
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:21,290
You don't need to understand
the individual details,

108
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:22,940
though they may be
of interest to you.

109
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,580
But I want to highlight
the large colored boxes.

110
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,470
So when we think about agents in

111
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:29,870
a system in this
particular study,

112
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,360
they had one set of
agents as a community,

113
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,730
which has its own set
of characteristics.

114
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:37,280
The second set of agents
were households and

115
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,540
social networks which have

116
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,490
a different set of
characteristics.

117
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,875
At the bottom of the figure
you'll see of course we have

118
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:45,110
individual level
characteristics and

119
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,700
some very important
characteristics

120
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,680
could include health behaviors,

121
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,870
existing health conditions and

122
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,910
the utilization of
health service.

123
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:54,935
We also have in the
upper right-hand corner

124
00:04:54,935 --> 00:04:56,060
other contexts things

125
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,530
that could potentially influence

126
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,345
the agents in this system.

127
00:04:59,345 --> 00:05:00,770
So now we've got a bunch of

128
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:02,720
individual agents in the system

129
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,370
but you'll see there's arrows in

130
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,425
the center line of
the figure around

131
00:05:06,425 --> 00:05:10,030
aging and movement between
communities and daily travels.

132
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:11,960
So those show that these
agents actually do

133
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,350
interact on a very ongoing
and frequent basis,

134
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:17,795
and that those interactions
ultimately across

135
00:05:17,795 --> 00:05:19,760
all these agents are what are

136
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,330
going to define our
population health.

137
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:24,805
So I'd like to give
you a specific example

138
00:05:24,805 --> 00:05:26,575
of an agent-based modeling study.

139
00:05:26,575 --> 00:05:28,300
In this study the
researchers modeled

140
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,970
interactions between
psychological attributes of

141
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:32,350
people and they're built-in

142
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,760
social environments and how

143
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,755
those interactions could lead to

144
00:05:35,755 --> 00:05:37,915
the creation and evolution of

145
00:05:37,915 --> 00:05:40,960
leisure time physical activity
patterns among adults.

146
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,600
Basically, what is it about
the way people think and

147
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,450
the environment that leads
them to physical activity.

148
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:48,520
So they were very
interested in modeling

149
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,085
the interactions again between
the social environment,

150
00:05:51,085 --> 00:05:52,990
the individual's social network,

151
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:54,700
the behavior of the community

152
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,560
but also the built environment,

153
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,290
do they have access to
physical activity sites?

154
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:00,700
What's the quality of sites?

155
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,200
What's the availability of

156
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,095
programming and activities
at those sites?

157
00:06:05,095 --> 00:06:07,335
So creating this
agent-based model,

158
00:06:07,335 --> 00:06:09,095
they were actually
able to reproduce

159
00:06:09,095 --> 00:06:11,840
trends in the
population in terms of

160
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,930
the intention to engage
in physical activity as

161
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:18,650
well as actual physical
activity engagement.

162
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:20,180
So again, just an example

163
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,530
of how this modeling approach was

164
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:24,170
applied to a very important issue

165
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:26,225
of getting people active.

166
00:06:26,225 --> 00:06:28,310
The third theory I'd
like to talk to you

167
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:29,690
about is scenario planning.

168
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:32,495
So this is very much a
strategic planning method

169
00:06:32,495 --> 00:06:34,280
that is intended to identify

170
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,605
and analyze potential
future events

171
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:39,380
and also identify
alternative outcomes.

172
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,990
So we can come up with
quantitative projections

173
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:43,550
or qualitative judgments.

174
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:46,070
So in the figure that
you're looking at here,

175
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:48,320
you can see for example
we might be interested in

176
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,840
scenario planning for
disaster response,

177
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,060
a very important activity
at the government level.

178
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,770
So things we might consider

179
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:56,620
here include public
health activities,

180
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,670
they could contribute or perhaps

181
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:01,190
take away from disaster response.

182
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,930
We have to of course
for see what sort of

183
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:04,580
unexpected events might we have?

184
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,710
What's sort of disasters
are absolutely

185
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:09,260
predictable given what we
know about the environment?

186
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,600
How might Medical
activities interface with

187
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,365
our ability to
respond to disasters?

188
00:07:14,365 --> 00:07:16,640
The biggest value of
scenario planning is

189
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,680
actually not necessarily
what you come up with,

190
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,055
but rather the planning
process itself.

191
00:07:22,055 --> 00:07:23,750
So here's an example from

192
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,720
the literature showing
you scenario planning,

193
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,790
in this case a group of
people was trying to predict

194
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:31,520
future scenarios for
community pharmacists

195
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,440
in the country of Portugal.

196
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,720
They came up with a
three-stage process,

197
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,684
the first was to
define the questions,

198
00:07:37,684 --> 00:07:38,990
the second was actually to frame

199
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:40,220
out the scenarios and the

200
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,985
third was actually to
develop those scenarios.

201
00:07:42,985 --> 00:07:44,465
I want to identify

202
00:07:44,465 --> 00:07:45,830
a few key elements in

203
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,240
the table here that
we're looking at.

204
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,735
So they identified three
potential future scenarios here.

205
00:07:50,735 --> 00:07:53,510
Again, this is not a class
intended for pharmacists.

206
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:54,830
So the details of this study

207
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,630
are not particularly relevant,

208
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:58,520
but they came up with three quite

209
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,829
different potential
future scenarios

210
00:08:00,829 --> 00:08:02,930
for community pharmacists where

211
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:05,780
their demand would
increase or decrease over

212
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:09,620
time and they identified two
critical uncertainties here.

213
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:14,255
Those being, what is the
demand for these pharmacists?

214
00:08:14,255 --> 00:08:16,430
What are the functions or

215
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,680
responsibilities of
the pharmacists?

216
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,095
Then those things
contribute to how well

217
00:08:21,095 --> 00:08:22,730
the pharmacists are
integrated into

218
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,975
public health care or not.

219
00:08:24,975 --> 00:08:27,820
Now I'd like to switch into
specific tools we can use,

220
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,360
and the first one I'm
going to focus on is

221
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,340
called a causal loop diagram.

222
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,575
This is basically a
qualitative picture

223
00:08:33,575 --> 00:08:35,780
of a mental model of a system,

224
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:38,960
and the qualitative pictorial
aspect allows us to

225
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,790
highlight causality but also

226
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:42,935
feed back loops within a system.

227
00:08:42,935 --> 00:08:44,749
So this allows us to categorize

228
00:08:44,749 --> 00:08:45,920
different variables and

229
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,080
potentially quantify
relationships.

230
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,270
So the fairly complex
figure you're looking at

231
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:52,445
here is intended to display,

232
00:08:52,445 --> 00:08:54,470
for example, features
that could contribute

233
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:56,510
to the death risk of a neonate,

234
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,055
and you can see here they have

235
00:08:58,055 --> 00:09:01,100
various nodes within this
figure highlighted in green

236
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,170
such as the awareness
of the mother of

237
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:06,325
maternal health care and
neonatal health care,

238
00:09:06,325 --> 00:09:09,730
availability of hospitals,
quality of delivery,

239
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:11,025
the health of the mother,

240
00:09:11,025 --> 00:09:12,320
lots of different features

241
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,315
that could potentially
contribute.

242
00:09:14,315 --> 00:09:16,460
So let's look at a
causal loop diagram

243
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,275
that's specific to
environmental health.

244
00:09:18,275 --> 00:09:20,675
I've drawn this one from a
study that was examining

245
00:09:20,675 --> 00:09:23,705
the impacts of climate
change on public health.

246
00:09:23,705 --> 00:09:26,420
With all causal loop diagrams,t
he first thing we do

247
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:29,130
is figure out what is our
central variable of concern?

248
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:30,590
In this case as you can see at

249
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:33,170
the center it was
heat-related illness.

250
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:34,850
Then we start to identify things

251
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:36,530
that contribute or impact

252
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:39,830
heat-related illness and try
to identify feedback loops.

253
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:43,065
These loops can be either
reinforcing or balancing.

254
00:09:43,065 --> 00:09:45,110
A reinforcing loop
as you can see it's

255
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:48,500
a semicircle with a plus
sign in the middle,

256
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,410
indicates that an initial
action is actually amplified or

257
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:53,660
reinforced through
subsequent actions

258
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,010
and a balancing loop,

259
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:58,460
a semicircle with a minus
sign inside actually

260
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:00,290
indicates a feedback cycle where

261
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:01,340
the initial impacts are

262
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,110
dampened through
subsequent steps.

263
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:06,410
So looking at this specific
figure you can see

264
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:07,775
heat-related illness has

265
00:10:07,775 --> 00:10:10,310
a reinforcing feedback
loop on the left.

266
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,710
So if you're socially
vulnerable you may

267
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:15,250
be more likely to have
preexisting health conditions,

268
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,060
both of those things
are going to worsen

269
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:19,310
your impact of
heat-related illness.

270
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:20,960
We've also got a balancing loop

271
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,580
here in terms of cooling centers

272
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,670
and access to cool spaces
that let people cooled down,

273
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,920
and of course all of
this is driven to

274
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,985
some degree by the presence
of high-heat days.

275
00:10:30,985 --> 00:10:32,890
So here's an example,

276
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:35,615
still sticking with the study
of heat related illness.

277
00:10:35,615 --> 00:10:37,580
So you'll see that as
a central component to

278
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,690
the figure but you see there are

279
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:40,220
several loops that
branch off that.

280
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:43,400
So I want to show you an
example of a reinforcing loop.

281
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,810
So if we look in
the lower left of

282
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,760
the figure you'll see a loop that

283
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,770
includes social vulnerability and

284
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:50,310
homelessness with a plus sign,

285
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:53,330
this is a reinforcing loop
basically saying that the more

286
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:55,025
socially vulnerable you are

287
00:10:55,025 --> 00:10:56,920
the more likely you
are to be homeless,

288
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,955
and of course once you
become homeless you become

289
00:10:58,955 --> 00:11:01,495
even more socially vulnerable.

290
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:03,650
So that's a reinforcing
loop in this case,

291
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:05,390
we could also look
at a balancing loop.

292
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:08,030
So if you look at the
right side of the picture,

293
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,200
we have a loop that includes

294
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,320
cooling centers and
passive cooling parks.

295
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,380
So this is a balancing loop
because as the demand for

296
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:19,100
cooling center increases
with greater heat,

297
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,705
people may tend to seek out

298
00:11:20,705 --> 00:11:22,910
other places that they
can go to cool off,

299
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:25,100
and as they find those
places that actually

300
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,420
reduces the demand on
the cooling center,

301
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,660
so that's why this is
considered a balancing loop.

302
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:32,090
We're dampening
that initial input.

303
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:34,160
The second and final
tool I'd like to

304
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,245
talk to you about
is process mapping.

305
00:11:36,245 --> 00:11:38,510
So process mapping
gives us tools that

306
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:41,675
provide a pictorial
representation of some sequence

307
00:11:41,675 --> 00:11:43,670
of actions and responses.This

308
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,830
can be used to better understand

309
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,470
current processes or
specifically to identify

310
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:51,335
where bottlenecks or
inefficiencies are occurring,

311
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:53,570
or it could be used to
produce a map of what

312
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:56,285
a is called ideal
process might look like.

313
00:11:56,285 --> 00:11:58,460
These are not used so
commonly in public health

314
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:01,025
but they're fairly common
in the medical literature.

315
00:12:01,025 --> 00:12:03,260
Now the image you're
looking at here is

316
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,570
a process map that's from 1921,

317
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:06,740
so I want you to understand that

318
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:09,290
this notion is not
new by any means.

319
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:11,540
In this case, this is a
process map of how you

320
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,930
load a particular type
of rifle grenade,

321
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:16,010
of course that's not a
concern to this class.

322
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:17,870
We're not going to be
loading rifle grenades is

323
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,940
an activity but I
want you to see and

324
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,620
you probably readily
grasp that this is

325
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,780
a very delicate and
sensitive process

326
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,790
that you want to do
right so you don't die,

327
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:27,920
and so someone has
taken the time here

328
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,095
to lay out each
step of the process

329
00:12:30,095 --> 00:12:32,390
in painstaking detail to make

330
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:35,320
sure that it's get done
correctly at the end of the day.

331
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,040
Looking at a more modern example,

332
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,740
so here's a medical
example of a process map,

333
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:41,990
and this would be applied by

334
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:43,760
doctors who are trying to control

335
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,375
intracranial pressure and
manage perfusion pressures.

336
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:50,585
So we have a starting point
in the upper left corner,

337
00:12:50,585 --> 00:12:53,585
and you can see there are
various steps along the way.

338
00:12:53,585 --> 00:12:55,850
There are actions that
are taken and then

339
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:58,975
the diamond symbols that
you see here are questions,

340
00:12:58,975 --> 00:13:00,855
and for most of these
the question is,

341
00:13:00,855 --> 00:13:03,705
is there an intracelebral
hemorrhage present?

342
00:13:03,705 --> 00:13:05,270
Depending on the answer there,

343
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:07,685
the process map goes one
direction or another.

344
00:13:07,685 --> 00:13:09,320
Again, this is not
a medical class,

345
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,165
I don't expect you to understand

346
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:13,280
any of the details
of this graphic,

347
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,800
but I want to show you how
this process map can take

348
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,530
a very complex process
and distill it down into

349
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:23,029
something that's very easily
communicated and understood.
