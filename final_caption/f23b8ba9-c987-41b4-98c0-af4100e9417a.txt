1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:01:00,640
Now. Get it out of the way. It is my pleasure to introduce Dr. Sutherland, who will be presenting on HIV and Cd8+ T cells.

2
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:13,960
A. Good morning, everyone.

3
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:17,800
I'm joined. And today I'm going to to you.

4
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:21,760
Oh, sorry. The. Very much.

5
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:27,710
Yeah. I'm going to present HIV controllers and keep it effective.

6
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:34,310
ADHD Cell Recognition of HIV one infection activates 84 T-cell.

7
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:40,610
I'm starting from I'm going to start from the introduction.

8
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:52,310
So HIV infection begins with transmission across the mucosal barrier, either by a cell free virus.

9
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:58,760
In fact, your cell or viral attaches to dangerous sex cells or Langerhans cells.

10
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:09,319
Only low level propagation probably occurs in partially activated 34 T cells and followed by mass propagation being

11
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:21,020
activated 34 T cells and then new viral disseminates to other secondary lymphoid tissues and establish a stable reservoir.

12
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:28,370
And there, of course, there are their possible mechanism for establishment of reservoir.

13
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:41,300
But I'm going to stop here. Immune response lags behind a burst of viremia and provides only partial control of virus notification.

14
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:51,890
As sure enough, greater viremia increases after exposure and peaks around two weeks after infection.

15
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,219
Amount of plasma transmit virus,

16
00:02:55,220 --> 00:03:11,270
then four in conjunction with the development of AZT l response to a steady state level of start point and thanks to anti retroviral therapy,

17
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:20,450
the a rapid decay in the viremia is produced below the limit of detection.

18
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:24,740
However, upon the treatment interruption,

19
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:35,660
the viral viremia rebounds rapidly and to become clean code detectable within weeks of interruption and rises to the previous step point.

20
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:46,590
However, there are some special patients long term on progress or who is I who have the

21
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:51,810
ability to maintain normal safety for T-cell counts for prolonged periods.

22
00:03:52,170 --> 00:04:00,809
And HIV controllers are a very small proportion of HIV infected population who managed to spontaneously

23
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:08,130
control viral replication and maintain stable safety for T-cell counts without the need for art.

24
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:17,640
Apparently, the appearance of controllers shows some hope for controlling and even ending HIV infection.

25
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,150
Therefore, we put forward our hypothesis.

26
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:29,850
Could HIV suppressive SCADA T-cells from HIV controllers recognize and cure not activated?

27
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:35,070
In fact, testing for T cells without requiring productive infection.

28
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:41,200
At first we confirmed HIV infection of primary night,

29
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:51,260
activated 34 T-cells and tested HIV specificity a t cell recognition of activated 34 T

30
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:58,910
cell infected directly from C different cell free virus in cell to cell transmission.

31
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:05,480
And then we investigated how that vaccination happened and what is the following effect.

32
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:14,060
And finally, we assessed whether they the response were enhanced in HIV controllers.

33
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:25,250
Here our results. At first we used a combination reporter virus system for detection.

34
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:41,930
To put it simply, virus entry was detected by cleaved CCF to a and then de novo and HIV protein production was detected by GFP expression

35
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:54,410
activator 84 as t cells highly permissive to entry by X for tropic hiv with varroa virus entry detected in high rates of.

36
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:04,589
Yes. The entry of our five top viruses also detected but lesser which is consistent with low our phi

37
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:11,720
expression on the resting state for t cells not activated CTE for 2000 remains nonproductive.

38
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:16,100
In fact, it is contrary to activated C for T cells.

39
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:26,760
Next, we tested the recognition by using confocal microscopy, microscopy and 3D reconstruction.

40
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:38,880
Showing here a high performing NCT while a seven day exposure at a point of contact with HIV positive 34 T cells.

41
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:44,250
And then we detected the establishment of a new C.

42
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:53,129
A new synopsis in shown showed here the HIV specific cd8+ t cells,

43
00:06:53,130 --> 00:07:00,990
the established immune synopsis for any viral entry in the absence of de novo viral protein production.

44
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:13,590
And the immunological synopsis led to functional engagement of cd8+ t cells shown here and

45
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:20,430
in order to assess the relation between synopsis formation and degree in your name lation,

46
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:24,580
we inhibited the formation of O.

47
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:39,990
Where you headed? The formation of synopsis by using the antibodies as you are here blocking the LFA one decreases the granulation.

48
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:50,470
Dan, we want you to tell us if the recognition or so happened under the current condition of a cell to cell transmission,

49
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:54,250
which has birds, which has black, white,

50
00:07:54,270 --> 00:08:02,200
which affected HeLa cells where several plasmid plasmids, including HIV X4 virus,

51
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:11,710
HIV R five virus and an X for a virus containing a mutation in the envelope, preventing viral fusion during that process.

52
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:19,930
Then they were co-cultured the ways they were co-cultured ways primarily not activated 34 T cells for 2 hours,

53
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:31,649
followed a kill culture, followed 5 hours of co-cultured ways, autologous cta t cells, and then we detected rates 86, 81,

54
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:45,459
1278 and through determined de granulation and the vapor brain assay to quantify the HIV entry as shown on the right virus entry,

55
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:58,870
have her waste X for a virus and are five virus but is but didn't have her with a fusion defective virus and similar to previous result.

56
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:06,310
Days in fact is 84 t cells induced granulation of C for cd4+ t cells.

57
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:14,760
Since the antigen process enzymes are lower than not activated 34 T cells.

58
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:25,560
We next investigate if the recognition is also in response to the presentation of viral peptides derived from incoming particles.

59
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:39,810
As shown here the de granulation in response to a fusion de virus reduced to background

60
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:49,410
levels and virally reverse transcription was not required to trigger the de granulation.

61
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:56,790
Besides blocking the HLA one car y mode,

62
00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:04,739
your mother juice resulted in a market decrease in cd8+ t cells which recover in

63
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:11,490
our guest to define the enrollment of antigen processing we use based on Team

64
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:23,549
E 64 and our POC so might seem to block a certain enzymatic activities in the

65
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:29,430
results showed that antigen processing is required for CTA t cell recognition.

66
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:42,460
In some days, data suggested that antigen processing of incoming viral particles needs several things.

67
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:47,080
First, HIV fusion into cytoplasm.

68
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:52,150
Second, HIV degradation by amino packages.

69
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:59,380
And process here. And presentation by Israel a class y molecules.

70
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:12,280
In order to address the cell killing effect. We from the this chromium released after being infected with HIV for 2 hours.

71
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:20,260
Primary activated CD4 t cells were incubated with 51 chromium for one hour and

72
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:26,710
then co-cultured raised cd8+ CD8 cells for 6 hours and then measured its release.

73
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:44,050
The results revealed that zero are killing by cd8+ t cells at multiple effector to target ratios and furthermore and to a one antibody compared to O.

74
00:11:44,230 --> 00:12:00,090
And furthermore, killing was dramatically decreased here by using the anti white antibody and with anti LFA one antibodies,

75
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:13,090
the killing also dramatically decreased, which showing the requirement for functional immunological synopsis of both HIV suppressive

76
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:19,660
cd8+ t cells not allowing t granule eight a power recognition but also kill these cells.

77
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:26,080
Next, we compared the response between pro aggressors and controllers.

78
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:37,809
Only 8488 results from HIV controllers recognized HIV 34 T cells as shown by the granulation interferon,

79
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:43,900
gamma production and macrophage inflammatory protein.

80
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:51,670
One better as HIV particles are many and composed of gag and pooled proteins.

81
00:12:52,180 --> 00:13:03,010
We hypothesis that viral peptides presented through HLA one shortly after HIV entry would prefer to target these proteins.

82
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:13,330
So we tested if gag peptides approval would simply stimulate stimulate more that response and

83
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:20,470
whether this part would attribute to the greater level of cell recognition as shown here.

84
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:28,030
After normalized way of the interferon gamma response to normal non productively infected

85
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:35,320
cells to the total magnitude of gas specific cd8+ t cell responses being the same subject,

86
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:46,870
we still see the difference in end to further analysis the role of Cd8+ t cell response in HIV control.

87
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:56,410
We evaluated the whether there was a link between interferon gamma produced and the size of reservoir.

88
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:06,850
As shown here, we observed an inverse association between among controllers and or patients.

89
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:18,830
So now activities for T-cells are permissive for HIV entry, then are productively infected and sedated.

90
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:25,560
Cells from HIV controllers recognize HIV positive not activators for t cells.

91
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:32,160
Antigens from incoming viral particles are presented to cta t cells.

92
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:40,020
So HLA cost y and density at his our recognition lead to the deaths of HIV in.

93
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:51,650
HIV. HIV no activator said for T-cells or so we have some limitation in so an implication for future study.

94
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:59,090
We need further studies to examine the recognition in the context of other restricting HLA

95
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:09,410
cause one at least and to confirm y CD4 cd8+ t cells for us HIV controllers are more efficient

96
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:17,030
and non productively infected cells can be targeted by cd8+ t cells suggested that there are

97
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:24,610
there is a path forward to reducing the viral reservoir and t cell based is for profit.

98
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:37,550
Lactic vaccines may act as an adjunct to antibody mediated vaccines as implicated by their ability to limit the establishment of reservoir.

99
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:42,720
That's all for my presentation. Thanks. Do you have any.

100
00:15:48,080 --> 00:16:00,190
Any questions from the audience? Everyone.

101
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:07,190
So it seems like so.

102
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:14,790
So I really like your slide about the controllers and the progressives are different from

103
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:22,530
the sedate because the severe T-cells have the ability to target the system for T-cells.

104
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:32,549
Do you think that there is room there for like a therapeutic a therapeutic vaccine or

105
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:39,510
some sort of way you could treat people that are infected by getting their CD8 T cells?

106
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:46,670
Like what? But what are the possibilities of actually.

107
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:57,030
In our in our research, there are some time point for for the city a recognition.

108
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:07,230
Oh it started from an early pace of the viral entry after viral entry to a virus entered the cells.

109
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:12,330
So that's maybe some. So it has to be done early.

110
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:19,050
It has to form early. So finding somebody chronically infected and then treating them may not work yet.

111
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:22,770
Okay. Okay. Thank you. Thank you very much.

112
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:39,170
So on this theme of presenting and fielding questions, I saw on Twitter that somebody had a like a picture of a Halloween,

113
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:43,970
Halloween pumpkin and said, Actually, I have more of a comment than a question.

114
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:55,650
All right. Let's go ahead and switch to the workshop.

115
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:59,587
I'm going to pause the recording. Give everybody time to kind of reset.

116
00:18:04,536 --> 00:18:11,776
Okay. I think we. Just remember, you go through record.

117
00:18:14,089 --> 00:18:17,259
Okay. I'm going. Excellent.

118
00:18:17,299 --> 00:18:26,538
So. All right.

119
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:34,129
So the two concepts we're going to be talking about on Monday when we read those papers are these concepts.

120
00:18:34,609 --> 00:18:39,649
If you are taking somebody that's at risk and you're changing their susceptibility,

121
00:18:39,649 --> 00:18:46,139
their kind of immune susceptibility to infection through either of these modes.

122
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:49,579
What are what are the pros and cons of doing it these two ways?

123
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:55,399
So the first well, the only way we have right now, I mean, we're very close to a nasty vaccine, but we don't have one.

124
00:18:55,789 --> 00:19:01,639
So the only way that we have to change susceptibility is either to infect somebody naturally,

125
00:19:01,999 --> 00:19:09,379
which we don't want to do, or we deliver antibody to them that's not produced by their own body.

126
00:19:09,769 --> 00:19:10,159
Right.

127
00:19:10,429 --> 00:19:22,309
The antibody can either be delivered through the pregnant person in utero, or the antibody can be artificially manufactured by a mouse or other rays.

128
00:19:22,309 --> 00:19:30,589
And then and then delivered. Now, that's how most monoclonal antibodies that get delivered are produced in usually in animal systems.

129
00:19:31,549 --> 00:19:39,859
So when we think about when you hear about monoclonal antibodies for COVID, for all these other mild antibodies that artificially produced antibodies,

130
00:19:40,459 --> 00:19:45,319
now because your body is not producing the antibody,

131
00:19:45,709 --> 00:19:55,159
you don't have this continuous flow of antibodies being made by your B cells like you would if you had been immunized or infected with the virus.

132
00:19:55,699 --> 00:20:03,709
You only have what's been given to you. So when it goes away, when it when it decays through a half life, it's gone.

133
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:12,839
Right. All right. So I'm going to back up and talk a little bit about what we know about RSV as as a disease.

134
00:20:14,489 --> 00:20:20,279
When we talk about respiratory viruses, we are often talking about, you know,

135
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:28,469
I've talked at different points in this course about how clinical definition matters or case definition matters when you're doing a study.

136
00:20:28,859 --> 00:20:33,239
Case definition especially matters when you're doing a randomized controlled

137
00:20:33,239 --> 00:20:38,069
trial of a product because you have to define what you're trying to prevent.

138
00:20:38,129 --> 00:20:42,299
But you're effective at preventing what you're effective at preventing all disease,

139
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:48,299
the effect of preventing hospitalization, all hospitalizations, respiratory hospitalizations.

140
00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:51,299
You have to define what your target of prevention is.

141
00:20:51,809 --> 00:20:59,159
And with respiratory viruses, one of the challenges are is that on upper respiratory tract disease and lower respiratory

142
00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:05,519
tract disease may have different signals in terms of whether or not you can prevent that.

143
00:21:05,909 --> 00:21:14,209
So if you look at the lower respiratory tract, we have, you know, croup, bronchitis, you get into things like bronchiolitis and pneumonitis.

144
00:21:14,729 --> 00:21:20,489
When you get into the lower respiratory tract, you have diseases that are more likely to cause medical visits,

145
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:23,459
shortness of breath, hospitalization and things like that.

146
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:30,059
When you're working with the upper respiratory tract, you've got otitis media ear infections,

147
00:21:30,239 --> 00:21:35,728
you've got runny nose, you have coughing, you have irritation in the upper respiratory tract.

148
00:21:35,729 --> 00:21:38,579
It might lead to it, for instance, like lost productivity.

149
00:21:39,509 --> 00:21:46,949
It might lead to discomfort, but it's not usually going to lead to major medical visits or hospitalizations,

150
00:21:46,949 --> 00:21:53,758
but it could lead to a lot of transmission because you've got a lot of virus in the upper respiratory tract that's really queued up in front center,

151
00:21:53,759 --> 00:22:00,419
ready to spread. So we have to pay attention to what specific disease states you're watching for.

152
00:22:02,459 --> 00:22:06,268
The RSV is a Perovic virus, it is an enveloped virus.

153
00:22:06,269 --> 00:22:11,789
It's not segmented into a single strand, a single single strand, negative sense RNA genome.

154
00:22:12,189 --> 00:22:18,389
The helical nucleocapsid if you remember my hot topic from when I went to the RSV meeting a couple of weeks ago,

155
00:22:18,389 --> 00:22:22,919
it's actually not a circle even that's drawn as a circle. So I apologize for the oversight.

156
00:22:24,149 --> 00:22:27,929
And we are talking a lot about the fusion protein now.

157
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:42,029
Fusion protein, you should recognize that protein because it's the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is has fusion action with that as well.

158
00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:48,539
So it's kind of some of the similar similar characteristics for the fusion protein here.

159
00:22:51,159 --> 00:22:58,159
There is fusion and fusion mediated replication process it releases through a budding process.

160
00:22:58,609 --> 00:23:07,129
The budding process of release of RSV will often lead to the formation of sensation

161
00:23:07,159 --> 00:23:13,639
so that the connection of multiple cells until kind of a large cellular body pair,

162
00:23:13,729 --> 00:23:22,439
a mix of viruses and incorporate a number of different viruses, not just RSV.

163
00:23:22,459 --> 00:23:28,368
So we've got restless and social virus here. There's also a very closely related virus, HPV,

164
00:23:28,369 --> 00:23:35,659
human melanoma virus that acts very much like an RSV virus is circulates at about the same time of year.

165
00:23:36,499 --> 00:23:42,919
It is usually a much lower prevalence. The nasty is usually about a half to a third of the prevalence of RSV in any given year.

166
00:23:44,299 --> 00:23:52,489
But we also have, you know, close certainly related we've got mumps and the of influenza viruses and measles.

167
00:23:55,069 --> 00:24:01,608
So RSV has types A and types B, they are different.

168
00:24:01,609 --> 00:24:09,289
The types A and type B are differentiated by virtue of sequence differences in the G protein.

169
00:24:09,289 --> 00:24:17,778
And I pictured a G protein there, but I will have it later. And our C tends to require very close contact for transmission.

170
00:24:17,779 --> 00:24:24,919
Oftentimes you see contact with secretions happening and it is quite unstable in aerosol forms we think.

171
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:32,329
So usually like you need an accumulation of mucus around the RSV virus for it to to transmit,

172
00:24:32,659 --> 00:24:37,968
you need like you need a glob of RSV common in young children.

173
00:24:37,969 --> 00:24:47,479
Also present in adults is actually very common in adults, but adults tend to have pretty mild illness or asymptomatic illness and it we see a lot

174
00:24:47,479 --> 00:24:51,739
of deaths from RSV each year in immunocompromised individuals and elderly individuals.

175
00:24:51,739 --> 00:24:57,199
And there's been a long history of research about the interaction between RSV and asthma exacerbations.

176
00:24:59,339 --> 00:25:12,839
So I've mentioned before this this kind of sense, this sort of the the this these formations of these collections of cells that form together.

177
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:23,069
And actually, that was some of the first ways that RSV was recognized as an as an infectious disease.

178
00:25:23,489 --> 00:25:30,059
So there was an epidemic in the University of Minnesota and a preterm nursery in a hospital.

179
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:36,749
There was clearly spread happening. There was a really high level of deaths among the preterm infants.

180
00:25:37,289 --> 00:25:46,559
And upon autopsy, they found this kind of characteristic pattern in the RSV cells.

181
00:25:51,109 --> 00:26:01,009
So the person that characterized this in the forties had had this sort of first bronchiolitis outbreak identified.

182
00:26:01,399 --> 00:26:06,739
Started to call it infant pneumonia or primary pneumonitis in infancy.

183
00:26:07,189 --> 00:26:09,979
And by 1956,

184
00:26:09,979 --> 00:26:16,849
it was starting to be called giant cell pneumonia because of this incision that were formed by these accumulation of the multiple cells together.

185
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:28,609
Around 1956, there was also the discovery of a chimpanzee virus that was causing that same sort of censorship pattern.

186
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:34,669
And then we were seeing, like in children, even with mild croup,

187
00:26:35,299 --> 00:26:41,749
the virus was isolated in a more mild group without having to do a full autopsy, they were able to isolate the virus.

188
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:46,579
And then in 1957,

189
00:26:47,649 --> 00:26:52,038
Janet figured out that the same virus that had been being worked up in these chimpanzee

190
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:57,429
outbreaks and in these babies were actually the same virus causing disease in both.

191
00:26:57,439 --> 00:27:02,329
And so it was renamed as virus Petraeus and social virus at that point.

192
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:07,999
There were continued observations of epidemics of this virus for the throughout the

193
00:27:07,999 --> 00:27:18,049
sixties led to some very early vaccine trials for RSV that had very tragic consequences.

194
00:27:18,589 --> 00:27:21,589
And in the review article you're going to read from Monday,

195
00:27:21,589 --> 00:27:25,609
it's going to talk a little bit and I'll talk about it more on Monday, but a little bit about the history.

196
00:27:25,819 --> 00:27:32,569
So then the reasons we don't have an RSV vaccine is that the first attempts at RSV vaccine caused exacerbated disease.

197
00:27:32,929 --> 00:27:39,589
So basically, if children got the RSV vaccine and then they got infected with RSV, they did worse.

198
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:46,789
The breakthrough infections were worse than somebody who had had a natural infection that was unvaccinated.

199
00:27:47,179 --> 00:27:56,539
So that just chilled the RSV vaccine development stage space for decades, really long time for it.

200
00:27:56,569 --> 00:28:03,618
So one of the studies that really defined how a respiratory virus is in general this kind

201
00:28:03,619 --> 00:28:09,019
of 1981 sort of comes after all those landmark respiratory virus studies we talked about.

202
00:28:09,829 --> 00:28:16,939
But to talk about how our study specifically transmits was something that we call the Cutler study.

203
00:28:17,989 --> 00:28:24,949
So we they had children that were identified as being infected and hospitalized infants.

204
00:28:25,339 --> 00:28:31,699
And they had nursing volunteers come in and interact with the children in different ways to see who got infected.

205
00:28:32,029 --> 00:28:42,499
And this is now this is known as the cuddle color study. So they had one group of individuals that close contact by holding the infants.

206
00:28:43,729 --> 00:28:47,358
One group of people came in and did self inoculation,

207
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:55,399
so touch the surfaces around the infants that had been contaminated and touched to their own mucosa to see who got infected.

208
00:28:55,819 --> 00:28:57,289
And then they had the sitters.

209
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:05,299
So the volunteers sat at a distance of over six feet from the infected infant, and they watched to see who got infected.

210
00:29:05,509 --> 00:29:10,309
The Cutlers got infected. The Tigers got infected. Visitors did not get infected.

211
00:29:11,209 --> 00:29:17,839
Ladies and gentlemen, this is what the six foot distance was determined based on some other research happening at the time.

212
00:29:18,169 --> 00:29:20,979
But this is you recognize this number.

213
00:29:22,429 --> 00:29:32,719
This is one of the major pieces of evidence around how six foot distance became this respiratory transmission idea.

214
00:29:33,259 --> 00:29:42,499
Now, remember what I just told you, that RSV requires a very mucous, heavy, wet, big droplet in order to transmit effectively.

215
00:29:42,679 --> 00:29:52,059
That doesn't mean as every respiratory virus and certainly coronaviruses do not work the same way, but RSV did and that was a different virus.

216
00:29:52,069 --> 00:29:59,949
And so you can see where what was learned from kind of very small studies get gets over extrapolated into new scenarios.

217
00:29:59,959 --> 00:30:03,799
Right. All right.

218
00:30:03,799 --> 00:30:09,499
So this is what the landscape looks like right now with the RC vaccine and the monoclonal antibodies.

219
00:30:09,829 --> 00:30:12,888
Path updates this like every couple of months.

220
00:30:12,889 --> 00:30:16,879
And so if you're interested in watching this space from a development space, keep an eye on this.

221
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:25,189
Right now in phase three, there are a combination of the vaccines that are marked with N.

222
00:30:25,249 --> 00:30:28,219
Those are maternal. Those are maternal vaccination products.

223
00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:33,169
So those are products where you're going to be vaccinating the mother with the goal of the

224
00:30:33,169 --> 00:30:38,209
mother or the pregnant person producing antibodies that are then transferred in utero.

225
00:30:38,929 --> 00:30:48,829
And then there are a lot of elderly for e for elderly adults as they get older, I like to call it older adults.

226
00:30:49,819 --> 00:30:53,899
But so so products focused on the older adult population as well.

227
00:30:54,649 --> 00:31:00,739
Although interestingly, there's been some modeling studies. We used to read this when I taught infectious disease EPI, but we haven't read this here.

228
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:05,029
But modeling studies that show that the most effective way to protect older

229
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:08,269
adults is to vaccinate over five year olds that the older adults take care of.

230
00:31:10,549 --> 00:31:13,969
They're also, you know, some pediatric products.

231
00:31:13,969 --> 00:31:19,189
The PS pediatric products have been very troublesome, trying to get a pediatric vaccine.

232
00:31:20,419 --> 00:31:23,718
And so we can talk a little bit more on Monday about why that is.

233
00:31:23,719 --> 00:31:27,858
And so you see a lot of pediatric product products administered directly to the infant.

234
00:31:27,859 --> 00:31:34,789
You see that in the monoclonal antibody space, but you don't see it advancing in the vaccine space very efficiently.

235
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:42,259
One of the reasons for that is because there is such effective maternal antibody transfer

236
00:31:42,649 --> 00:31:48,559
in infants that during those first few months when an infant is most at risk of RSV,

237
00:31:48,709 --> 00:31:53,329
they have so much maternal antibody that vaccinating them is not going to lead to

238
00:31:53,329 --> 00:31:57,169
immune and immune response that they generate on their own that they're able to mount.

239
00:31:57,499 --> 00:32:06,199
So you actually have to just supplement it using antibody alone without using like an antigen prompted active immunization strategy.

240
00:32:09,419 --> 00:32:12,989
So that's where this pass of antibiotic prevention comes in right now.

241
00:32:13,049 --> 00:32:16,109
And then probably step up to the side. Right now, there is synergies.

242
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:21,509
How busy, mab? It is a humanized monoclonal antibodies artificially produced.

243
00:32:21,569 --> 00:32:23,579
It requires monthly dosing.

244
00:32:23,999 --> 00:32:32,699
It is prophylactic and it is phenomenally expensive because each dose only only lasts about a month and you see doses about $10,000.

245
00:32:33,329 --> 00:32:36,089
So it is very hard to get your kid approved to get it.

246
00:32:36,419 --> 00:32:44,489
Once your kid gets it, they have to come into the hospital, do doses monthly and you have to start dosing before RSP season hits.

247
00:32:45,179 --> 00:32:49,109
So there's been an incredible amount of investment in trying to understand how do you

248
00:32:49,109 --> 00:32:54,779
predict when RSV is coming so that you can dose all of your at risk babies fast enough?

249
00:32:55,229 --> 00:33:01,109
So you can imagine the disruption that happens now that RSV is happening outside of the normal season.

250
00:33:01,349 --> 00:33:07,799
Right. So all the efforts to get the babies dosed in the children's hospitals fast enough is now kind of messed up.

251
00:33:08,609 --> 00:33:15,419
So with that and here is like basically here are all these requirements you have to meet to get synergies.

252
00:33:16,379 --> 00:33:20,189
This says 2017 to 2018 the top and tell you these guidelines have not changed.

253
00:33:20,549 --> 00:33:24,059
You basically have to fall into one of these very complex categories to get approved.

254
00:33:26,489 --> 00:33:32,999
All right. So I'm going to pick up on Monday talking about these new extended duration monoclonal antibodies and then the vaccine landscape.

255
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:40,939
And then we'll go through your papers for Monday where you can.
