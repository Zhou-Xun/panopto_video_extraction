1
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:17,440
But we will spend about 15 to 20 minutes going through the exam and I will provide answers.

2
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:21,070
Although if you have version B, some of them may be out of order.

3
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:29,320
So let me know for number one which one of the following statements regarding cumulative incidence is false?

4
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:35,650
That would be due, it included includes measures of person time.

5
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:39,650
It is not very short at 11.

6
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:45,840
Not going to change course. Yeah, the true impulse is the problem.

7
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:51,170
We have version three down here and section of the.

8
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:54,610
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

9
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:59,290
Okay. How long you can keep going. Sorry. I know I have 30.

10
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:19,759
Well. Okay?

11
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:34,270
Yes. You also.

12
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:48,390
So I will start with your number one, which on the key is number 11,

13
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:58,110
the true and false for a disease that is highly contagious and fatal if left untreated but curable with treatment.

14
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:07,770
We would prefer screening test with high sensitivity but average specificity over a test with average sensitivity and specificity.

15
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:18,510
This is true. If the incidence of a disease is increasing, then the number of people in the population with that disease must also increase.

16
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:26,730
That is false. The number of deaths among African-Americans in the United States in 2014 divided by the total

17
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:33,510
population of the United States in 2014 would be an example of a group specific mortality rate.

18
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:39,410
That is false. Let's look here. What's the correct answer?

19
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,770
Three. It is false. I mean, like, what is it? It's like.

20
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:01,560
I think it's like asking for you to not compartmentalize.

21
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:09,190
It's like a segment of the population. It's like a group localized to a specific area.

22
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,390
So that is why that piece is false. Yeah.

23
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:22,190
But I would also email Dr. Buxton about that, because you do have a point that that is accurate because it isn't hard to see.

24
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:34,850
Yes. Interesting question and your reporting of the incidence of falls among residents of senior

25
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:38,630
living communities of out of state officials to monitor the health of older adults.

26
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:44,960
Senior living communities see large decreases in their population sizes between December to April,

27
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,860
when snowbirds in Michigan migrate to Florida for the winter.

28
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:56,540
Given that many seniors travel over the winter, a cumulative incidence would be the preferred measure over incidence rate.

29
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:01,639
This is false. Next question.

30
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:05,670
Only the CDC decides which diseases are reportable in the U.S.

31
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:12,340
This is false since it is also decided by state legislatures and health departments within the states.

32
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:23,209
That's why there are approximately 114,000 individuals in New York who are living with HIV,

33
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:29,990
AIDS, and approximately 3800 individuals in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, living with HIV AIDS.

34
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:39,680
Thus, based upon this information alone, we can conclude that the prevalence of HIV aids is greater in New York as compared to Baton Rouge.

35
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:47,360
This is false because the cumulative incidence is the proportion of people at risk who

36
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,130
develop a disease of interest during a specified period of time at a particular place.

37
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:00,770
That is true. To be most effective, screening programs should be implemented in populations after the onset of symptoms.

38
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:06,050
That is false. You want screening done before the onset of symptoms.

39
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:11,540
All of those criteria must be present to confirm a causal association.

40
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:27,160
This is false. You mainly require temporality and in addition to that, they just support your case for causality and not sabotages, basically.

41
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:36,110
Active public health surveillance occurs when health agencies contact health providers seeking reports on specific health outcomes.

42
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:59,570
This is true. Now we go back to multiple choice.

43
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:09,480
We're number 11. Which one of the following statements regarding cumulative incidences false.

44
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:16,800
It does not include measures the person time you have tested negative on a

45
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,880
screening test for colon cancer but are still worried that you have colon cancer.

46
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:27,540
Which one of the following statistics would be most informative to understand the certainty of your diagnosis?

47
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:40,600
It would be the negative predictive value. For the answer consistent with the graphic, which you can very much not see on the screen.

48
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:50,320
It shows that disease X is becoming less fatal over time with the prevalence increasing and incidence slightly decreasing.

49
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:57,580
You can see with prevalence increasing, more people are living with the disease instead of dying from it.

50
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:07,110
A screen test that was first used in a population with low prevalence of disease is now being used in a population

51
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:14,309
with higher prevalence of the disease selects the answer that most appropriately fills in the respective blanks.

52
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,300
The following statement.

53
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:24,570
In the new population, the sensitivity of the screening test will stay the same and the positive predictive value will increase.

54
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:29,880
Sensitivity will not change with these criteria.

55
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:38,740
Which of the following activities do not represent screening activities?

56
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:46,630
Taking a baby aspirin daily to prevent a heart attack is not screening a preventative measure.

57
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:57,819
For the following statement, please select which type of mortality metric it describes among HIV positive patients in China.

58
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:07,480
Between 2006 and 2013, 21.5% of the deaths were due to accidental causes and or suicide.

59
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:10,720
This is the proportionate mortality.

60
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:21,190
You were awarded an amazing internship to work with the World Health Organization in Nigeria on a vaccination campaign for measles.

61
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:31,630
Vaccination for measles is what type of prevention it is primary prevention, because you're seeking to prevent the onset of disease, period.

62
00:08:51,640 --> 00:09:03,310
For the causal paths shown below representing all of the causal paths for contracting HIV variable E is a component cause of HIV.

63
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:09,550
You don't see it in all of the cars, but you see it as a component and part number one.

64
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:13,540
Variable.

65
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:24,040
A two answers were accepted and is a component because of HIV, but it is also a necessary cause because you see it in each of the causal codes.

66
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:33,330
You might find that your grandfather and father both had colon cancer and you're worried that you might get colon cancer.

67
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:40,270
Do you find that you to find out if you are at increased risk of developing colon cancer?

68
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:46,320
You decided to have testing for several genetic mutations that are known to predispose to colon cancer.

69
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:55,860
What type of prevention is this? It is none of these, which is kind of a tricky question.

70
00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:05,430
Yeah, I won't go into primary prevention because it's not going to stop the disease from occurring.

71
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:11,250
For secondary, you want to detect it before the development of symptoms?

72
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:19,770
Yeah, that's right. For tertiary, you're really you've already developed symptoms and it's not diagnosis.

73
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:26,100
For genetic mutations, it is not a guarantee that you're going to develop the disease.

74
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:30,480
It's just associated with it. So it's like a clue that it might happen.

75
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:36,040
It's not definite, so it won't prevent it.

76
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:39,750
It's not a screening for it. So it's just this might happen.

77
00:10:56,430 --> 00:11:05,059
I can show. Yes.

78
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:10,610
That's what I was just discussing, is that because it's the genetic mutation,

79
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:18,760
it doesn't guarantee you turn the corner, you can prevent the disease from occurring.

80
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:25,969
And it's not really an extreme form forward or something that might cause at the present or tertiary.

81
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:29,060
You have no something diagnosed this. You won't have it. It's.

82
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:44,620
Oh, okay.

83
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:51,760
The country of Nigeria had a population of 190,900,000 persons in 2017.

84
00:11:52,780 --> 00:12:02,140
On January 1st, 2017, there were 3,528,360 people in Nigeria living with HIV AIDS.

85
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:10,210
Over the course of the year, 216,614 new HIV AIDS infections occurred.

86
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:21,700
From January 1st, 2017 through December 31st, 2017, 169,103 individuals had died due to HIV AIDS.

87
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:30,190
There were 2,311,799 total deaths in Nigeria in 2017.

88
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:34,720
When asked to interpret, think about the who, what, when and where.

89
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:38,800
Which should always be in your interpretation statements. Or they take point.

90
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:49,360
But it is very important to describe who you're talking about, where it occurred, what is going on and when.

91
00:12:54,730 --> 00:13:06,310
For this question. An example of a good answer would be among people in Nigeria with HIV AIDS in 2017, 4.5% died due to HIV AIDS.

92
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:23,020
For the calculation, you get 169,103 divided by 3,744,974.

93
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:30,010
That is the case fatality rate for HIV AIDS in 2017 in Nigeria.

94
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:37,809
For this one, calculate and interpret the mortality rates of HIV AIDS in 2017.

95
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:41,770
And Nigeria, report your answers per 100,000.

96
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:59,830
The correct answer would be found by dividing 169,103 by 190,900,000, and then multiplying that by 100,000 for your interpretation.

97
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:10,750
Among the total population in Nigeria in 2017, 88.6 per 100,000 people died due to HIV AIDS.

98
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:22,140
For the next question, calculate and interpret the proportionate mortality of HIV AIDS in 2017 in Nigeria.

99
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:33,990
The correct answer can be calculated by dividing 169,103 by 2,311,799.

100
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:38,210
This will give you an answer of 0.073.

101
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:49,770
So converting that to a percentage of all the deaths in Nigeria in 2017, 7.3% of deaths were due to HIV AIDS.

102
00:14:53,250 --> 00:15:00,330
For this one to calculate and interpret the cumulative incidence of HIV AIDS in 2017 in Nigeria.

103
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:17,550
The correct answer will be 216,614 divided by 187,371,640, which gives an answer of 0.00116.

104
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:32,250
So among the total population in Nigeria in 2017, 116 per 100,000 people at risk of HIV AIDS developed HIV aids.

105
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:38,999
And these are our example interpretations that include all of the criteria asked for.

106
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,690
But who, when and where. It doesn't have to match word for word.

107
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:50,340
It just needs to have those components and consider the following events in one woman's life.

108
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:58,170
Note that some events are hypothetical and some are real. Birth at age zero.

109
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:03,900
Cellular changes associated with cervical cancer begin at age 30.

110
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:08,430
Cervical cancer detectable by screening at age 40.

111
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:14,430
The woman is screened, cancer is detected and treatment begins at age 45.

112
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:24,660
If no screening symptoms were developed and cancer would have been detected at age 60, and if no screening, death would have occurred at age 70.

113
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:33,550
In this case, death occurs at age 80. So compute the clinical phase of this woman's cervical cancer.

114
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:36,450
Assume she did not get screened for part eight.

115
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:45,480
This will be 70 years marked as 60 years which gives you ten years for the clinical phase was ten years.

116
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:57,240
Compute the total preclinical phase of this woman's cervical cancer assumes she did not get screened for this question.

117
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:03,570
This will be 60 years, -30 years, which gives you a total of 30 years.

118
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:17,760
Compute the lead time for this one. So this will be 60 years, -45 years, which gives you 15 years.

119
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:23,810
And this part is worth out the assumption that she didn't get screened.

120
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:33,440
So in this case, she did. The training increased the lifespan of the patient.

121
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:42,200
Justify your answer in two sentences or less. For an answer, yes, you would give your justification,

122
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:47,600
including something like The woman would have died at age 70 if she had not been screened for cervical cancer.

123
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,470
However, because of screening, her death occurred at age 80.

124
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:57,530
Therefore, her lifespan was increased by ten years over what it would have been without screening.

125
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:14,950
On to the problem solving question for the hypothetical data on urinary tract infections.

126
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:19,270
Calculate and interpret the epidemiologic measures below.

127
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:24,100
Once again, when asked to interpret, think about who, what, when and where.

128
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:28,690
Assume participants were followed for the month of April 2012.

129
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:37,720
Shaded cells or days with UTI. Once they had UTI, they were no longer at risk of getting the disease again during the study period.

130
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:44,770
So calculate and interpret point prevalence for UTI on April 15, 2012.

131
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:54,489
At this point, you can find it on your little graph there and there will be two out of seven.

132
00:18:54,490 --> 00:19:15,650
So 0.29. Calculate and interpret the incidence for UPI per 100 for the study period,

133
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:24,650
and those would be four divided by seven times 100, which would be 57.1 for per 100 people.

134
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:32,400
Once again, the interpretation should include include who, what, where and when.

135
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:47,570
Calculate a person who is at risk for the entire study period.

136
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:56,300
So this would be ten days plus, 30 days plus one day plus 30 days first 11 days plus 28 days for 30 days,

137
00:19:57,050 --> 00:20:02,060
which would be 140 days if you add up all of the participants and their time at risk.

138
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:16,380
Calculate and interpret the incidence rate for UPI per 100 or 1000 person days for the study period,

139
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:23,730
and those would be four divided by 140 times 1000, which is 28.57.

140
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:37,710
For this question. There were 312 new employees at the University of ORU Hospital who were screened for tuberculosis in 2015.

141
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:42,960
They were tested first with the current gold standard, and 36 people tested positive.

142
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:51,090
All employees were tested with a tuberculin screening test when comparing the results of the tuberculin screening with the gold standard.

143
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:55,350
There were 21 false positives and six false negatives.

144
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:06,960
So for the six pack, you would place them down in the screening negative and has to be.

145
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:16,200
And for the 21, they would screen positive, but they do not have TV.

146
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:29,700
So allocating the rest of the people you have again so a 50 and so the 235 which is a bit hard to illustrate without the screen,

147
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:39,870
but I guess I could draw it. But we are about past time for going over this and you can ask more questions and office hours, which I can clarify.

148
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:48,090
Would the Professor, Dr. Buxton, calculate and interpret the sensitivity of the tuberculin skin test,

149
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:56,480
which would be 89.3% using this table and your formula for sensitivity?

150
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:06,400
Four Part C calculate interpret the negative negative predictive value of the tuberculin skin test.

151
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:15,520
This would be 97.5% using her formula which is should have been given so.

152
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:22,049
Going to do this a little out of order since we had a technical issue.

153
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:31,110
And go ahead and start on your engaged learning assignment number six, which you can find under the assignments on canvas.

154
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:36,540
And after that is completed, we will go over Quiz eight.
