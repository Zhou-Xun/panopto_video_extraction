1
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:33,240
Think. I think.

2
00:00:51,550 --> 00:01:04,550
This. This.

3
00:02:08,840 --> 00:05:02,000
Oh. I don't.

4
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:38,560
I. Okay.

5
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:58,049
I think we can go ahead and get started. It's lovely that you're all very excited.

6
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:04,250
But the quiet down of all your.

7
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:19,850
Maybe. All right.

8
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:26,299
Thank you. So it is lovely to I'll see you at the beginning of the semester.

9
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,160
I hope you're all in here for public health.

10
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:39,140
350 So just briefly, I mean, I put this here on the slides, but I just am planning on starting at 435 each week.

11
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:42,380
Of course, you're able to come in here as soon as you want each day.

12
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:47,480
But I have some faculty meetings which go until 430 and I just want to be consistent

13
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:51,290
and be respectful of your time and not have to like change up week by week.

14
00:06:51,290 --> 00:07:01,429
So 435 is when we're going to be starting. So there's a lot of things that we can do to to kind of get this class off to a start.

15
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:06,680
But I actually wanted to, you know, I'll, I'll introduce myself, I'll introduce the class,

16
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:13,520
but I wanted us to do a smoker breakout to start off this semester.

17
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:19,790
And this was a really interesting article that I found in MPR last month,

18
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,499
but it's echoed in a lot of research which has been going on over the past couple of years,

19
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:29,840
and a number of different outlets have have reported on a number of different similar research findings.

20
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:36,350
But we have this this really astounding headline.

21
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:41,300
American life expectancy is now at its lowest in nearly two decades.

22
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:48,139
So among some people who are around you, I would like you just to discuss this for just a couple of minutes.

23
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:52,610
You know, we could spend a whole semester on this, but what are some of your thoughts on why this is the case?

24
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:56,540
Why has life expectancy in the US decreased?

25
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:06,440
So once you have some thoughts in your mind, I would love for one person from each group, so maybe groups of three or four would be ideal.

26
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:11,719
I'll give you a couple of minutes, but then, you know, there's probably a bunch of different reasons.

27
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:19,070
But when you have a reason, if you could come up to this blackboard in at some location, just write a brief.

28
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,290
Like your reason in a in a really in a really short summary.

29
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:28,760
It doesn't need to be super long. It doesn't need to be nuanced. But do you understand the assignment?

30
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,880
Okay. I'll check back in in a couple of minutes.

31
00:08:38,210 --> 00:09:09,360
That. Right?

32
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:40,510
Right. Then you just. You think you. But.

33
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:31,920
Okay. If your group has not come down, I would love for you to at this point in time.

34
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:39,170
Otherwise, we can come back as a class. But.

35
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,390
Okay. So you all have been reading.

36
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:07,260
Amazing things. And I would like to say that this is probably you know, this isn't something that we can just have a succinct conversation about.

37
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:11,700
This is something which I think we really need to digest.

38
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:19,590
I would say all of these are a lot of these are things that I have heard before in the articles that have been written about this.

39
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:23,160
This, you know, these are are things which people have written about.

40
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:30,329
I love that some of you were focused on very particular things, you know, like drug use, overdose, like a very specific idea.

41
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:36,000
And then other people were thinking about more structural issues like politics.

42
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,340
And I think economics was written somewhere as well.

43
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:45,180
But the reason why you bring this up in a global health course, in an introductory global health course,

44
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:49,200
is because this isn't the trend which has been seen in every country.

45
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:54,479
You know, here in the United States, we've seen this declining trend in life expectancy over the last couple of years,

46
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,240
but that hasn't been the case in many other countries.

47
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:04,770
And I think one of the interesting parts of global health is looking at international comparisons, seeing what's working in other countries.

48
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:08,459
How can that be used to apply to our own situation here in the U.S. and certainly at

49
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:13,560
some points thinking about what we can export here in the US in terms of research,

50
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:23,219
in terms of good scientific and health information and how we can, you know, across the world result in better health outcomes.

51
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:30,600
But the results that, you know, for us to be able to understand this, we need to be able to do international comparisons.

52
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:35,460
We need to be able to understand what is a health status and how can you measure health status?

53
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:45,240
How can we measure things like life expectancy? We need to be able to understand why there might be differences in health across different countries.

54
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:49,770
And yes, we'll be talking about some very specific things, but we will be talking about a lot of structural things.

55
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:55,200
And this class does have a decolonizing framework which is at its core as well.

56
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:04,830
So this is all stuff that we are going to be talking about throughout the semester, and I appreciate your energy and participating in this.

57
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:10,140
But a bit about me.

58
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:14,190
I am. I'm Abram Wagner. I'm a research assistant professor.

59
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:17,879
You can call me Dr. Wagner. Professor Wagner. You can also call me Abraham.

60
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,120
That's totally fine. I use him pronouns.

61
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:23,759
I'm currently on the research track,

62
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:35,309
and one thing that means succinctly is that I am part of the lecturers union and I am not sure if in other classes you've,

63
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:40,920
you've had a lecture before, but it's a bit different. You know, I have a union behind me instead of being part of the tenure track.

64
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:52,620
But why am I here in the in this in the front of this class right now giving you know, leading this this course on global health?

65
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:58,920
My own research is based in doing work internationally.

66
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:02,250
I work a lot in China and in Southeast Asia.

67
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:06,989
Much of my dissertation research was based on fieldwork I did in China.

68
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:15,569
I had a Fulbright at Fudan University and I continue being a faculty member here just working internationally,

69
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:18,000
and that has continued through the COVID 19 pandemic.

70
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:26,010
We have some amazing geoscience as part of this class, so I will just have them briefly introduce themselves.

71
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:34,749
Hi, everyone. My name is Lindsey. I'm a first year Ph.D. student majoring in the epidemiology.

72
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:43,170
And I will be leading discussions. Three and four is you all Thursday and Friday.

73
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:47,860
And. Q Yes, I did.

74
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:52,240
Q. What happened to your mom as you.

75
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:59,660
Five. So Thursday in the morning is Friday. You all here?

76
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,800
Okay. So let's talk a bit about the syllabus.

77
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:14,959
So what is the structure of a typical week? So on Mondays and Wednesdays I will be delivering the lecture.

78
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:21,650
But you know, me talking for an hour and a half straight is not not probably the best thing pedagogically.

79
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:26,240
So there will be a combination of small group work that you do some lecturing.

80
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,320
I also pull everywhere things for you to do over time.

81
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:34,009
So I want it to be as active as possible.

82
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:41,270
But you know, it is a lecture class where we're here in this classroom on Thursday and Friday you will have discussions.

83
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:53,959
Those are led by Q and Mundie. A lot of those are related a bit to the topic in the week, but they're also different.

84
00:16:53,960 --> 00:17:03,320
So there's a different purpose to the discussion. So the purpose of the discussion is for you to learn a topic or a skill a bit in depth.

85
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:10,400
So for instance, in a class next week you'll be learning how to compute DALYs or disability adjusted life.

86
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:15,770
Years later on this semester, we'll have some more in-depth work on calculating odds ratios and risk ratios.

87
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:21,110
We'll also have you practice using citation management software like Sotero or Mandalay.

88
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:27,890
So those are really important things for you to learn in discussion. That's better for like more of a hands on experience for you.

89
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:36,919
You'll also be doing a debate during the discussion section and we'll I'll talk about that later on.

90
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:42,500
But that's part of the discussion. And then one of the assignments in the class is a health policy brief,

91
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:50,360
and there will be a lot of scaffolding throughout the semester during the discussion sections just for you to learn what a health policy brief is,

92
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:57,469
for you to draft parts of it, for you to get feedback from other classmates, and for you to do an elevator pitch.

93
00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:06,170
So basically the discussion section is a place where you can kind of deal with some of the course content a bit more in-depth.

94
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:14,230
Okay. So I will try to update the power points by noon of the day of class and probably even the night before.

95
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:21,700
But the PowerPoints which are already on campus, are like 90 to 95%.

96
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:30,640
What I will be using. So one thing that you'll note for me is that a lot of our documents are linked through Dropbox.

97
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:37,660
I know for many students that can add some annoyances, especially if you're using an iPad or something.

98
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:45,940
But it's just like so much more convenient for me, especially if I'm doing last minute edits to the slides or to other documents.

99
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:53,830
So I would recommend for all of you to try to download these before class,

100
00:18:53,830 --> 00:19:00,580
and especially if you're using an iPad for you to download them, convert them to a PDF and upload them to whatever you're using.

101
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:06,340
And I'm certainly available to help with that if you have any questions during office hours.

102
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:11,739
But I'm not going to put the PDFs themselves on canvas just because it's easier for me

103
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:15,820
to be able to continually update things through the PowerPoint and through Dropbox.

104
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:23,900
Okay. So one thing which you may or may not have strong feelings about attendance in this class is required.

105
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:32,120
So at the beginning of most lecture classes, I will put out some attendance sheets in the back of the class and in here.

106
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:36,170
So right now I'm just going to pass these around. So just kind of like zoom them through the rows.

107
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:42,980
And if you're in the back, you can just like keep them on one of the desks and I'll grab it after class.

108
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:48,020
So I will actually. Can you just put one of these?

109
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:56,790
So if you could find us, that would be absolutely lovely. Um, so I.

110
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:04,410
Why am I requiring attendance in the lecture? This is something that, you know, us as faculty, we've had extensive discussions on.

111
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:09,570
What does it mean to have a synchronous class during a pandemic?

112
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:15,290
What does it mean to live in, like, in a post-pandemic world? What is the value of education?

113
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:16,830
There's a lot of deep things here.

114
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:25,230
I think for me, concrete concretely, it's just a bit depressing to kind of come into this room and have like four students sitting in front of me.

115
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:29,159
So that's why I'm requiring attendance at it's basis.

116
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:38,700
But I am going to be trying to have there be a use and have there be a value to attending class synchronously.

117
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,350
And there's a number of reasons for that.

118
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:49,140
One is, I think, you know, there will be this small group work and that's just really hard to do in a setting where.

119
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:55,960
You know, where you're just viewing things asynchronously. Uh.

120
00:20:56,270 --> 00:21:06,129
And then, um. Asynchronously, like having reviewing a recording that is an hour and a half long is not pedagogically.

121
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:12,790
It's not great. And I think each of you can kind of think that I'm not going to ask anybody, but like,

122
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:17,739
did you actually if you had a class which didn't have a required attendance policy,

123
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:21,610
were you actually viewing those Panopto or those Zoom recordings after class?

124
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,710
I will say I've been to like many conferences and if I'm not viewing something synchronously,

125
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:31,930
it's just really hard to get motivated to watch something which is like an hour or an hour and a half long.

126
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:37,480
So if this were to be an asynchronous class, I would have reconfigured the design of it.

127
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:44,500
So I'm just trying to put you into the synchronous setting because that is that is how I design the course.

128
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:49,359
I'm not doing hybrid just because that's really difficult to configure and it's

129
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:54,640
hard to think of small group work that can be done through Zoom and in-person.

130
00:21:56,260 --> 00:22:03,280
However, I do think there are reasons why you may not want to be coming to class, and I think that's totally fine.

131
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:10,480
I will say that I give full points just right off the bat. If you're if you miss up to five classes, that's totally fine.

132
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:18,250
There's no impact on your in how many points you get for the the lecture attendance.

133
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:22,510
If you miss more, then I'll start deducting some points.

134
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:36,930
But if you do miss less than these 23 classes or if you if you don't attend as many as these 23 classes, and if there is a compelling reason,

135
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:44,820
like if you have some sort of sickness, if you have some sort of university sponsored event, you know, there could be all sorts of reasons.

136
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:54,510
You can of course, you don't need to come to class, but you do need to fill out something online providing some documentation.

137
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:56,999
And it doesn't necessarily need to be something from a doctor,

138
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,680
but just like give me some information, you know, like you're sick and you're not able to make it.

139
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:09,149
That link is in the syllabus that's on canvas. And I would I really want you to be using this Google form.

140
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:14,970
I will get a notification of the Google form. But one of the things about this class is that there's almost 100 of you.

141
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:21,630
And for me, I'm trying to manage my email communications with you to the best of my ability.

142
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:30,600
So for me, I just like having things about the attendance go through this Google form because it's standardized.

143
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,120
It asks for the information you can provide it,

144
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:39,990
and then there's a place for me to look at it later if I need to figure out if there's a reason why you were not attending class.

145
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:47,220
So again, you do not need to email me directly if you're not able to to come to class, fill out this Google form and it will show up in my inbox.

146
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:58,300
And then similarly there is a Google form for you to do if you miss class and if you need to do a make up,

147
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:07,570
that's another Google form where it's basically, I just want you to watch the Panopto recording and then I want you to provide some feedback on,

148
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,920
you know, we had this for instance, we had this small group breakout.

149
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:16,900
So if you were viewing this, I want you to paste into the Google form, like what what your thoughts were on this.

150
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:21,910
And there's other breakouts. I'd want you to fill out that information as well.

151
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,840
Okay for discussion. There's a similar policy,

152
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:32,399
except that there is no recording done in discussion and purposely we're not doing recordings in discussion

153
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:38,340
because I do want this to be a place where you see things and you can be vulnerable if you want.

154
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:39,779
If you don't want to, that's totally fine.

155
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:44,970
But I just do want there to be a recording of some of these conversations that we've we're having in discussion class.

156
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:49,290
But if you absolutely need to miss more than three weeks,

157
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:55,500
this is just a conversation that you should have with your GSI and they might be able to come up with an appropriate make up for you.

158
00:24:55,800 --> 00:25:01,129
But that's emailing your GSI specifically about that. Okay.

159
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:05,090
So any questions about the attendance policy?

160
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:20,069
Okay. So to each class, I do want you do reading and there are some simple quiz questions on campus, so please do this prior to each class.

161
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:23,280
Obviously there is nothing for today, but starting Monday there is.

162
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:26,219
These reading quizzes are already up there.

163
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:34,920
So, you know, if you just want to get a head start on all the readings this year and do all or do a lot of them this weekend,

164
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:38,550
you totally will be able to. These are very short quizzes.

165
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:42,450
You know, just a couple of questions per reading assignment.

166
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:50,549
And, you know, it's designed to make sure that you actually open up the readings and to

167
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:53,590
highlight some of the most important parts of the readings that I think there.

168
00:25:56,790 --> 00:26:06,059
Okay. So for this class there are three assignments and I've tried to design these assignments so that they are

169
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:12,600
useful for a potential future career in global health and that they have sort of real world equivalents.

170
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:16,259
So these aren't just things that you would only have to do in a university setting.

171
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:23,309
But, you know, these are things which might be applicable to the world at large or to jobs outside of academia.

172
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:28,020
So the first one is doing a burden of disease profile.

173
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:31,830
So the burden of disease profile for our country in Africa.

174
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:36,120
Again, we'll talk more about this over time.

175
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:41,910
There will be a librarian who comes in a couple of weeks to talk about how you do research and how you gain information about this.

176
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:47,370
And during the discussion sections, we'll talk about, you know, what do we mean by burden of disease?

177
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:52,439
How do we measure disparities? And that will be due February 12th, the health policy brief.

178
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:57,930
Again, this will be scaffolded throughout the discussion sections, but this will be due in March.

179
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:04,979
And then there is a draft proposal that you have to do for a Fulbright project, and that is due in April 16.

180
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:15,090
So I designed this health policy brief because I had students in who graduated from the program who came to me

181
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:19,829
and said that health policy briefs were sort of something that they had to do at an internship or at a job,

182
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:22,469
but they just didn't really have a lot of familiarity with them.

183
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:29,700
So I wanted to kind of give that familiarity to you in case you kind of go off in more of a legislative direction in the future.

184
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:38,810
And then if you want to do something related to international research, I think a Fulbright program is a great a great source of funding for that.

185
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:43,950
So that's also why I have that as an assignment. Okay.

186
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:53,280
So how it works is a manual grid assignment, one kewl grade assignment to and I will grade assignment three.

187
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,800
So there will be some sort of, you know, some consistent grading for each of the assignments.

188
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:05,349
Across all assignments, you can submit up to 40 hours daily. That's that's cumulative that's across all of them.

189
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:11,830
So you could, you know, submit assignment 147 hours late in an assignment to an assignment, 330 minutes late.

190
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:15,729
That'd be totally fine. You do not need to notify about us about that.

191
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:18,790
That's just available for you. Certainly.

192
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:28,750
If you think that you need to have more time, that's something to email me about and ask me for an extension.

193
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:34,600
And what your plan for a make up is. And, you know, there's there's a lot of things going on in this class.

194
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:42,400
So I worry that if you delay on one assignment, then you're just going to kind of get backtracked with a lot of different assignments.

195
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:51,270
For both assignments, one and two, we're going to get those grades back to you relatively soon after you submit them.

196
00:28:51,900 --> 00:29:00,510
And the reason why we do that is if you want to ask for make up points, there is there is a systematic way you can do that through the canvas.

197
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:07,709
So. And of course, these individual assignments we'll talk more about in future classes.

198
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:12,570
But any questions right now? Not 48 hours.

199
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:21,950
48 hours. It's 40 hours total. So you can distribute you can distribute your 48 hours however you want across these.

200
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:25,309
So like for assignment one, you could submit 10 hours,

201
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:32,360
late assignment to 20 hours late and then assignment three, 8 hours because that would add up to 48 hours.

202
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:38,180
But for instance, if you do the same at 145 hours later, then assignment two was 10 hours late.

203
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:41,830
That would already be beyond the 48 hours. Does that make sense?

204
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:49,070
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

205
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:57,750
So how assignments work? Each of these are an individual assignment, and I want you to put like your own effort into this,

206
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:03,600
but I'm all for sharing of resources across different individuals.

207
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:10,650
But, you know, when you it's it's one thing to kind of tell somebody else, oh,

208
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:15,720
here's a nice resource, here's the nice reference which worked for my assignment.

209
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:20,370
That's very different than like copying and pasting each other's.

210
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:27,969
What you've been writing. So and I think that, like, intuitively makes sense, you know, but these are these are individual based.

211
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:32,740
But certainly, you know, if you want to kind of share ideas with other people, that's that's totally fine.

212
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:38,500
I want these to be as reflective as possible as what happens in the real world and in the real world.

213
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:41,890
Oftentimes things are done very collaboratively.

214
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:47,950
But, you know, I want you to be able to graduate this class and be able to maybe show a future employer.

215
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:51,960
Here's a health policy brief that I made, and then it has to be something that,

216
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:55,540
like you had control of, and it was something predominately written by you.

217
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:04,020
Okay. So I call these exams, but they're really just brief quizzes.

218
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:08,250
So these are on canvas. These are things which you should do yourself.

219
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:13,440
But these open up and you're given a couple of days to do these on canvas.

220
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:15,480
They're mostly multiple choice.

221
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:24,060
These could be based on anything from the class, including readings, including discussions, but predominantly it will be based on the lectures.

222
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:28,860
And at the end of each PowerPoint, I have a slide which is called the study guide.

223
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:33,400
And the study guide is predominantly where I'm going to be drawing these questions from.

224
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:43,589
So my recommendation for you at the, you know, after each class is just to look at the study guide and to try to filter it as much as possible.

225
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:49,800
And that will, you know, get you 80% to prepping for this exam.

226
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:55,500
So this exam is you know, you do it at home on your own.

227
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:59,760
This is obviously then open Internet. It's open book.

228
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:04,080
You can ask me you can ask Geocities any questions that you have.

229
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:10,380
But this is something that you're not able to do with other classmates. So please don't do it with other people.

230
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:20,560
Um. I think I already talked about this. Okay, so, um, discussion, debates or any questions about the.

231
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:31,160
I don't think Sam's. If. So what is open?

232
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:35,230
Is there any really? Yes.

233
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:41,980
Yep, yep, yep. Reading quizzes. Open up. Yeah. I know that the exams are not.

234
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:52,350
Okay. So part of discussion is to do a debate.

235
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:57,450
So I have a debate already up on on canvas.

236
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:01,260
It's one that I did. I have a recording of. It's only 10 minutes long. Please watch it.

237
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:06,030
Prior to, uh, prior to discussion this week in the debate.

238
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:14,430
There is global health is public health. So how the debate works is that you'll be put into teams.

239
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:16,229
Usually there will just be two people per team,

240
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:24,950
but there might be three people depending on the class size and you will have two people and he will randomly split you up.

241
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:32,670
So this isn't something that you have control over. If you have strong feelings against doing one of these, please let your GSI know.

242
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:38,820
But otherwise we will just be randomly divvying you up across these five different debates.

243
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:45,680
So for instance, for this first one, internationally, programs should focus on vertical, not horizontal programing.

244
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:49,060
We will talk about what horizontal and what vertical programing means during class.

245
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:51,219
But basically,

246
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:56,920
one side is going to be arguing that vertical programing is more important and one side will be arguing that horizontal programing is more important.

247
00:33:57,610 --> 00:34:06,210
So the side for the proposition will start off and they will have 3 minutes to make their argument and then the other side will have 3 minutes.

248
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:11,110
Then we will break and then you will have the second half.

249
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:16,120
The debate will be again. Each side will have 3 minutes to make their case.

250
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:25,060
What I will want for the debate is also for you to at the same time to fill out Google Google form.

251
00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:29,170
So I have that linked on canvas. That's in the email that I sent out to you.

252
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:37,329
So before your discussion this week, you should open that Google form.

253
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:42,969
And it's a very simple set of questions. It's like, what's your name? And then do you agree with this motion or not?

254
00:34:42,970 --> 00:34:48,830
And you say yes or no. And then you listen, you you go over to the the recording that I have.

255
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:52,600
Global health is public health. You listen to the recording and then you go back to the Google form.

256
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:57,070
And then there's the second question. Did you change your mind? Do you agree or not agree with the motion?

257
00:34:57,460 --> 00:35:04,390
And then there's a space for you to write some comments down. So please do that prior to discussion this week.

258
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:11,770
And then in future weeks, when we do have a discussion, you'll have time during class to write up your thoughts about each of the discussions.

259
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:19,560
And so this is just some friendly competition. And then after each week, after the debate, I'll announce the class.

260
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:23,220
How many people have changed their minds or you know, I think, though,

261
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:29,190
the winner of the debate for me will be looking at before people view the debates,

262
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,600
after people viewed the debate,

263
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:37,530
how many people change their mind in each direction and the side which is able to get the most people to change their mind is the winner.

264
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:42,330
And there is no benefit to that other than you should just feel really good about yourself.

265
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:46,709
Okay. So we'll be talking more about these in discussion this week.

266
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:51,900
But in the debates are internationally programs should focus on vertical, not horizontal programing.

267
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:59,250
Food from GMOs should be used in international aid programs. Children should be getting be given antibiotics prophylactically to improve growth.

268
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:03,360
Use of psilocybin, mushrooms should be legalized and medical mission trips are beneficial.

269
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:07,530
Again, all of these things will we'll touch on like a bit during class,

270
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:14,700
but I will expect they will have to do like a bit of research outside of class and work with your, your teammates.

271
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:21,149
Okay. So I wanted to talk a bit about ethics in this class.

272
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:26,250
And, you know, we will have a formal lecture on ethics later on in the semester.

273
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:34,560
But let's just talk about this right now in terms of like your work in this class.

274
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:39,630
So I, you know, the exams, for instance, those are on canvas.

275
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:42,870
I do that because that's just easy grading for me.

276
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:46,200
Um, it is also doesn't need to take up class time.

277
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:53,639
It works. You know, this also means that it's relatively easy for you just to sit down with a classmate and to do it.

278
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:58,260
I understand that. Um, I am hoping that that's not something that you end up doing.

279
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:08,370
And one of the reasons why that is, I want to, I, I just want you to behave as ethically as possible.

280
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:12,030
I think in public health you could end up in careers which have.

281
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:17,840
An enormous impact on people's life. And so I think, for instance,

282
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:25,610
of people who worked in the governmental office for Environmental Health in Genesee County and in Michigan, the state as a whole.

283
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:33,560
During the Flint water crisis. There was a lot of complaints from residents prior to this becoming like a big thing.

284
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:39,160
But I think a lot of people in government just ignored it.

285
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:46,249
A lot of people in public health just didn't. And I am not trying to say that, you know,

286
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:52,159
the reason why these people behaved in a way that I would say unethical is because they were cheating in classes in college.

287
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:59,600
But I think there is something there with like in life, we practice our ethical skills and then we become ethical throughout our lives.

288
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:07,340
But at the same time, I'm not going to stand behind you and watch over everything you're doing in this class,

289
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:10,760
because there are too many of you to do that. That's not something that I want to do.

290
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:18,020
I want to respect your autonomy and your time and everything like that. But please do just.

291
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:25,840
Be as ethical as possible. I think that's again, that that's just important for us to to do in public health.

292
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:31,120
Has anyone heard of Chatty Betty? Okay.

293
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:34,000
So I'm fascinated by this.

294
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:42,489
So there has been a number of advances in AI over the years, and none of them have been able to transcribe my name correctly in voicemails.

295
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:46,480
But some of them have led to things like this, like Cat GPT,

296
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:51,850
which is something you sign up for online and you're able to like input a prompt

297
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:57,400
and maybe your prompt is going back to are just maybe your prompt could be.

298
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:03,010
What is the burden of malaria in Nigeria?

299
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:07,930
And can you explain why there are disparities in malaria in Nigeria?

300
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:16,989
And I have not tried this, but it will spit out an essay and it sounds very intelligent,

301
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:25,060
but sometimes it is and sometimes it is not, and sometimes it misrepresents data and sometimes it doesn't.

302
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:30,969
I will say that there are since Chad GPT has been developed,

303
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:39,490
there have been other people who have developed ways that you can test whether somebody has used GPT or not.

304
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:45,520
And I'm not below or I'm not above using that myself.

305
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:48,160
If I if I think that a student is just using this,

306
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:56,740
I will say that one of the hardest parts of an assignment is staring at a blank page in a word, and thinking, You know how?

307
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:59,530
What do I write? What's the first sentence? How do I structure this?

308
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:04,940
And for our class, for especially for assignment two, we give you a lot of scaffolding because again,

309
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:08,660
I even I get paralysis of like, what if I'm writing a paper?

310
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:12,290
It's just really hard to look at a blank sheet of page in front of me.

311
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:20,300
So I do think there's probably a use for Chad GPT just to kind of get the juices flowing for you to be thinking about a topic a bit.

312
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:25,670
But I want in the same way that I think in terms of ethics,

313
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:32,900
you should be behaving ethically now in a way to predispose you to be continually ethical throughout your life.

314
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:40,160
I, I personally would be scared as an individual if, like all of my assignments could be replaced by chat, CBT.

315
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:44,070
And, you know, there's an emphasis on us as instructors for making sure that, you know,

316
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:47,890
you can't just easily cheat your way through writing assignments through eyes.

317
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:59,660
But, um, you know, I want you to all have jobs in the future which are nice and productive and not in our, in our are great for you.

318
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:07,850
But I think that also means you need to be putting in some heavy lifting now to learn skills and not be fully replaceable by an air.

319
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:14,150
So this is all to say. I'm I'm curious if anyone ends up just using this.

320
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:17,270
I hope it is not you who submits something purely from this.

321
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:24,589
But if you're ever curious about what Chad CBT says as a response to an assignment prompt,

322
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:28,610
I would I would I would love a comparison of what you wrote in what the Chad GPT said.

323
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:34,459
And again, if it's something which is humorous, if it's something that even stimulates you a bit into thinking about one thing or another,

324
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:37,670
I'm totally for that, but relying solely on this.

325
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:45,450
It is a bad thing and it's similar to like in any of the assignments you can have other people help you and maybe this A.I.,

326
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:51,730
which is put together by I don't know, I assume somebody who's going to be start harvesting all sorts of personal information from you.

327
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:57,940
Um, if that's, if that's what gets you through this class as a way of just like thinking through things,

328
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:03,490
um, I am not necessarily opposed to it, but like you can't just omit something from it again.

329
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:08,470
I think in my mind that makes sense in the assignments are designed not to be completely.

330
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:13,570
You know, able to be written by robots. But we'll see.

331
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:20,200
Any questions on that? Okay.

332
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:26,780
So in this class, I want to ask this question why does health vary across populations and countries?

333
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:29,780
And we need to pick apart this question what does health mean?

334
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:35,480
What are different dimensions of health? What do we mean by populations and countries?

335
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:40,070
How do countries vary in terms of health? How do they vary in terms of development?

336
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:46,010
And then what does this word very mean? How do we quantify disparities?

337
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:52,650
And for this class, because it is a global health course, we are looking at international power structures.

338
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:59,250
We are looking at ideas of neocolonialism. And again, these are all terms that we will define later on.

339
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:07,530
And we want to be talking about what organizations can help to increase health and to decrease disparities across populations.

340
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:16,700
So I want this class to be skill based. I want you to be able to get something out of this for you to, you know, as you're writing it,

341
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:21,920
admission's letter to a graduate program or you're applying for a job or an internship.

342
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:24,919
I want you to be able to see that, like you can do some things.

343
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:31,460
And it's not just us discussing the decolonizing framework, which in itself is interesting, but I want you to have hard skills as well.

344
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,060
So I want you to be able to calculate and interpret measures of disease burden.

345
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:39,470
I want you to calculate interpret measures of disparities like odds ratios and risk ratios.

346
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:43,850
We'll go over Eisner's I want you, Bill, to thoughtfully debate a global health topic.

347
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:46,010
You're going to write a health policy brief.

348
00:43:46,830 --> 00:43:54,870
And through your Burden of Disease report, you're going to be able to synthesize information about social, economic and cultural impacts on health.

349
00:43:57,290 --> 00:44:01,400
Okay. And these are basically kind of tied to the learning objectives of the course.

350
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:08,550
So this class has as a framework the decolonizing movement.

351
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:10,590
And what do we mean by this?

352
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:18,420
This has been something which kind of has come to the forefront over the past few years and certainly during COVID 19 has has really arisen.

353
00:44:20,010 --> 00:44:27,419
The idea is that, you know, since time immemorial, countries have been colonizing other countries.

354
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:38,010
But I would say, like especially since, you know, the colonization of the Americas and of Africa in the 1800s, there has been,

355
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:48,420
you know, a variety of of of huge power imbalances and of racism, which has accompanied the colonizing movement.

356
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:55,219
So for global health, you know, certainly we're not talking about like mass movement of people across the world,

357
00:44:55,220 --> 00:45:01,940
but we're talking about like where is the power being held in these global health organizations like who at the WTO is calling the shots?

358
00:45:02,930 --> 00:45:12,230
You know, in countries in Africa, are they totally revamping their health care systems because the World Bank said they had to do that?

359
00:45:13,370 --> 00:45:20,659
That's what we're worried about. And the decolonizing framework is this idea that global health should be something where

360
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:26,030
there aren't these large power imbalances between countries and especially between,

361
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:32,820
you know, what we might consider the global north and the global south. Okay.

362
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:39,330
So with that, I will kind of just jump into our first lecture.

363
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:45,300
And this is all about what is what is health, what is global public health?

364
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:49,680
The first thing we need to do is define health. And so the WTO has this wonderful definition.

365
00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:53,430
Health is a state of.

366
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:58,750
Physical, mental and social well-being. And it's not merely the absence of disease.

367
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:02,030
So health is not the absence of disease. It's something like holistically more.

368
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:10,160
So for in terms of physical well-being, that's probably what people first think about when they think about health.

369
00:46:11,870 --> 00:46:19,240
So having a body that works. Having a set of lifestyle behaviors that avoids risk factors.

370
00:46:19,730 --> 00:46:23,900
Being able to have enough nutrition, getting the food and water you need, getting sleep,

371
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:29,450
having physical activity, being able to have personal hygiene, that's that's physical well-being.

372
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:33,710
I think this is the thing that, you know, we probably think about most when we think of health.

373
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:41,810
But, of course, there's mental well-being as well. And there's sort of this self-efficacy of being able to realize your own abilities.

374
00:46:42,710 --> 00:46:49,250
You know, how much resilience do we have in coping against stresses in our life?

375
00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:57,980
And everybody has, you know, a set of normal stresses, but are we able to also deal with more acute stresses as well?

376
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:05,430
Mental well-being also has to deal with, also has to deal with working productively and fruitfully and being able to

377
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:08,820
situate yourself within a community and make contributions to that community.

378
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:15,490
Social wellbeing is all about respecting individuals.

379
00:47:15,850 --> 00:47:20,440
You know, we exist in families, we exist in communities. And there can be diversity in that.

380
00:47:21,310 --> 00:47:26,650
We want. We have relationships. We have a variety of hierarchical relationships with our parents, with our kids.

381
00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:31,210
We have more coequal ones, with our siblings, with other members of society.

382
00:47:33,070 --> 00:47:36,130
I think social well-being also has to do with access to education as well. So.

383
00:47:36,170 --> 00:47:42,840
So where do we fit within our community? Okay.

384
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:51,569
So we can quantify people's health status and maybe, you know, this is going to be a bit abstract,

385
00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:57,870
but we have sort of an ideal health status for somebody and then there's death.

386
00:47:58,590 --> 00:48:01,920
So this is like the range of health statuses for an individual.

387
00:48:03,710 --> 00:48:06,500
And this is our ideal health health trajectory over time.

388
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:14,810
We will stay at a very ideal state and then at a ripe old age, we will drop dead very quickly.

389
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:19,250
And that is, you know, I think that is what everybody wants in in life.

390
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:25,190
And one thing I will say is that part of public health and part of global health is we're not.

391
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:30,280
We're not trying to prevent death. We're just delaying it as much as possible.

392
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:34,719
And that's an important framework to to think about, because, you know,

393
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:39,870
we can joke a bit about this, but, you know, eventually we're all going to die.

394
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:43,630
But we want to be as healthy as possible up until that moment.

395
00:48:45,410 --> 00:48:47,120
But what often happens instead.

396
00:48:47,210 --> 00:48:54,080
So there could be somebody who, you know, is born at a less than ideal health state and then kind of fluctuates over time.

397
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:57,710
Maybe they come down with a certain illness, they're treated for it.

398
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:02,930
This happens a couple of times, but then eventually they succumb to some illness and they die.

399
00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:11,800
You know, there could be variations on this in terms of how severe the illness is.

400
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:18,470
I think D is often what happens in the United States, in many other countries is just kind of over time.

401
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:25,399
We get affected by more chronic conditions and our health status just deteriorates and deteriorates.

402
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:32,479
And you know, how we feel a decade from now will be just like much worse than it is right now, which is, you know, a bit sad to think about.

403
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:36,230
But it's not just this sudden drop. It's like more of a steady drop over time.

404
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:41,840
So this is kind of what we see a lot of the time in in high income countries like the United States.

405
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:47,150
But in any situation, we want to push ourselves to this ideal health trajectory.

406
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:56,589
Okay. So. The thing with this,

407
00:49:56,590 --> 00:50:05,590
and maybe I'd want you to kind of have like alarm sounds kind of going off in your brain is what do we mean by ideal health status?

408
00:50:05,950 --> 00:50:12,220
What do we mean by death? Um. I would love for you to.

409
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:19,460
Fill out this questionnaire online. If somebody goes there and they can't access it, please let me know.

410
00:50:19,470 --> 00:50:28,970
But. For each of these, put them on a scale between zero and ten where zero is death and ten is complete health.

411
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:34,730
So I would like your kind of opinion on where each of these would would fall.

412
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:40,650
I'll give you just a couple of minutes to figure it out.

413
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:19,649
And while we wait for other people to finish, if you want to tell your neighbor which one you thought was the worst thing,

414
00:52:19,650 --> 00:52:43,580
which one you thought was the best, please do so. Okay.

415
00:52:43,590 --> 00:52:46,659
I'm going to. Sir, presenting this in a moment.

416
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:52,110
And just one thing about people everywhere, which is a bit annoying, is once I start presenting it, it'll kick you off the poll.

417
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:57,320
But I don't mean. Any harm to you.

418
00:52:57,320 --> 00:53:01,390
But let's just think through what you all are thinking.

419
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:08,969
Okay. So for for this one, we're thinking about diarrhea.

420
00:53:08,970 --> 00:53:13,920
An infinite zero is death and ten is complete. Health crises is a bit bimodal.

421
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:17,700
Some of you are like kind of in the two and three range and some in the seven and eight range.

422
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:26,139
And of course, you know, this also has to do with what is our cultural conception of what like a bowel movement is.

423
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:33,650
And it could be different in different places. And what do we expect our kids to have?

424
00:53:33,670 --> 00:53:43,739
Like, maybe this is I knew somebody who did a survey of diarrhea in, uh, in a rural region of,

425
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:54,400
of Ecuador and was asking people like if, if their children had had diarrhea in the past couple of weeks and just the.

426
00:53:55,560 --> 00:54:01,230
The predominant bowel movement among children in the setting was like very watery and would be considered diarrhea.

427
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:09,990
So you know, what's normal and what is not does vary across the country. And I do want to acknowledge that as there's sort of this distribution here,

428
00:54:09,990 --> 00:54:14,070
there could be a distribution among like what experts would think and like maybe different people in different areas.

429
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:20,440
Okay. Another one, acne in adolescence. I'm going to assume this is just like summer.

430
00:54:21,770 --> 00:54:25,389
This is the worst thing that has ever happened. But I get, you know, subjective.

431
00:54:25,390 --> 00:54:32,230
You could, like, slip. Okay.

432
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,880
Treated schizophrenia in young adults.

433
00:54:35,030 --> 00:54:42,800
Again, we kind of see a distribution here, minor headache, where, you know, we're thinking that people are generally pretty healthy.

434
00:54:43,190 --> 00:54:51,230
Um, cold sores, you know, again, not somebody didn't really like those, but I think for most of you, you're kind of keeping these up here.

435
00:54:52,070 --> 00:54:58,160
This is one in this kind of things. But like, how do we deal with, um, disabled individuals as a society?

436
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:01,760
So what do we think of people who have to use a wheelchair as an older adult?

437
00:55:03,010 --> 00:55:06,760
And you know, how we make value judgments like this could impact, you know,

438
00:55:07,870 --> 00:55:14,260
how cost effective we think certain health programs are depending on if it if it results in people needing to use wheelchairs or not.

439
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:21,550
Okay. So this is an interesting one I compared, you know, what is it like for older adults?

440
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:29,889
What is it like for younger adults? And I would say there's this shift downward where I think for many of you you're thinking it's

441
00:55:29,890 --> 00:55:36,220
worse off to require the use of a wheelchair as a young adult compared to being an older adult.

442
00:55:36,430 --> 00:55:43,030
And I don't think that's a surprising finding at all. Some of these health conditions are very age specific.

443
00:55:46,150 --> 00:55:49,870
Okay. Untreated myopia. This is, you know, are you nearsighted or not?

444
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:54,880
And again, without my glasses, I would definitely be not at full health.

445
00:55:55,690 --> 00:55:59,829
But you're in myopia, I think, and some of you don't realize that. But for most of you,

446
00:55:59,830 --> 00:56:05,500
I think the implication here is that we should be able to shift things like we can

447
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:12,040
does design interventions which shift things so things like untreated myopia.

448
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:14,020
This is like a huge disability.

449
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:23,290
But like we as a society and most societies throughout the world have been and we have been able to accommodate individuals who are sight disabled.

450
00:56:23,290 --> 00:56:29,349
And so we just don't really think about it anymore. So I do want us to be thinking about like, what does disability mean?

451
00:56:29,350 --> 00:56:36,400
What does it mean on a global level? And how can we treat things in kind of shifting so that we can, you know, push people into full health?

452
00:56:38,490 --> 00:56:49,580
Okay. So thank you for going on that adventure with me. We'll be talking more in a week or two about health states as well.

453
00:56:52,790 --> 00:56:56,479
Okay. So most of you are public health majors, so they're not all of you.

454
00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:00,230
And I think you kind of have this this drive in, this passion for public health.

455
00:57:00,230 --> 00:57:02,630
And I love that. I love feeding off of that energy.

456
00:57:03,830 --> 00:57:08,720
And I think we kind of have an intuitive understanding already, I'm sure, from Public Health 200, which many of you have taken.

457
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:12,709
But there's this difference between public health and medicine.

458
00:57:12,710 --> 00:57:18,110
Public health has a focus on population. The ethical basis is professionalism in terms of public service.

459
00:57:18,950 --> 00:57:21,890
So this service to the general public and not just to an individual.

460
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:26,680
Generally in public health, we're focusing on disease prevention and health promotion,

461
00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:30,630
and we think of a variety of systemic or structural interventions.

462
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:33,910
I think those things in public health, we think are a bit more cost effective.

463
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:39,990
So medicine is much more individual focused. And I think this is kind of, you know, a continuum.

464
00:57:41,010 --> 00:57:44,909
So it's hard in some situations to think about like what is medicine, what is public health?

465
00:57:44,910 --> 00:57:52,010
There's a lot of overlap. You know, there's a variety of essential public health services.

466
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:59,790
So what do we do in public health? And, you know, if you're your parents are wondering why you have this major while you're taking this class,

467
00:57:59,790 --> 00:58:07,650
I think these are some things that you can rattle off to them. But public health is about monitoring health status in our community.

468
00:58:09,030 --> 00:58:13,799
It's about diagnosing, investigating these health problems of what are the outbreaks which are happening in a community.

469
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:18,180
That's what people did. You know, that's what epidemiologists at the state of Michigan have to do,

470
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:21,839
is they they look to see how many cases of chicken pox are there in Oakland County.

471
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:24,960
And if it's above a certain amount, they think there's an outbreak and they'll go investigate it.

472
00:58:25,770 --> 00:58:31,860
Certainly they there's a movement to investigate or a movement to educate people about health issues.

473
00:58:32,190 --> 00:58:34,860
You know, we have a whole department here of health behavior and health education.

474
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:41,760
I think they're being renamed to health behavior and health equity, but they're all about how can we empower individuals on different health issues.

475
00:58:42,630 --> 00:58:44,250
We work with community partnerships.

476
00:58:44,610 --> 00:58:51,030
I think community engaged research, community engaged programs are the ones that work the best instead of just having like a top down approach.

477
00:58:52,350 --> 00:58:57,420
And of course, it's not just working with programs and communities, but what kind of policies, what kind of legal solutions are there?

478
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:02,129
Um, you know, public health is also about enforcing laws and regulations.

479
00:59:02,130 --> 00:59:09,110
You know, what do you do if somebody has been bitten by a.

480
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:15,880
Ferret, and the ferret does not have a rabies vaccination.

481
00:59:17,410 --> 00:59:25,629
And so there were cases that, you know, went all the way through the courts which ended up having to euthanize the ferret and tested for rabies,

482
00:59:25,630 --> 00:59:30,310
because we wanted to make sure that the individual wasn't infected with the rabies virus.

483
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:35,020
So all sorts of of really life and death things happen in public health.

484
00:59:35,020 --> 00:59:40,990
Like we can link people to service when it's otherwise unavailable.

485
00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:45,820
Maybe we, we think a bit more about public insurance programs like Medicare and Medicaid.

486
00:59:47,170 --> 00:59:52,090
VA There's the Indian Health Service. There's all sorts of things which are available more on a public level.

487
00:59:53,370 --> 00:59:56,729
We, of course, are thinking about developing a public health workforce.

488
00:59:56,730 --> 00:59:59,850
And I'm hoping that many of you become part of that workforce,

489
00:59:59,850 --> 01:00:05,520
or at least are much more aware of what that workforce means as a result of taking classes like this.

490
01:00:08,090 --> 01:00:11,870
Okay. And then, you know, I'm down here in research. I work in academia.

491
01:00:11,870 --> 01:00:19,149
We do research. So public health is all about like what are these interventions that we can do on a population

492
01:00:19,150 --> 01:00:24,070
level to improve individual's health and we can think about low cost and high cost interventions.

493
01:00:24,730 --> 01:00:30,490
So again, we over somebody's lifetime, we hope that they have ideal health and tell a very old age.

494
01:00:32,610 --> 01:00:36,840
But at various points we can prevent.

495
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:43,440
Then from having a lower health service, we can keep this high health set us up through public health interventions.

496
01:00:44,490 --> 01:00:52,350
So by having clean water and clean air sanitation programs available, we make sure that individuals at an early age have a high health status.

497
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:58,030
Because in the absence of this, they might be more likely to have diarrhea,

498
01:00:58,040 --> 01:01:03,290
they might be more likely to succumb to a variety of illnesses and get very sick or potentially even die.

499
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:10,400
So through public health, we just like push up their health status ahead of time. And we can do that through, you know, health education.

500
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:16,490
We can do that through chronic disease management. We can do that through psychiatric counseling.

501
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:22,190
These are things which on the whole are low cost for their ability to prevent really

502
01:01:22,190 --> 01:01:26,000
disastrous outcomes and to prevent people from having lower health services.

503
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:30,799
I want to contrast that with high cost interventions.

504
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:41,540
High cost interventions with the things like somebody came down with sepsis because of, you know, maybe there wasn't clean water in their household.

505
01:01:41,990 --> 01:01:49,280
They got an illness. The rehabilitation after that life threatening infection would be very costly.

506
01:01:50,730 --> 01:01:52,709
So if we're treating things after the fact,

507
01:01:52,710 --> 01:02:00,420
that means that somebody's health status is already pretty low and it's much more costly to bump them back up than to just keep them at a high level.

508
01:02:01,020 --> 01:02:07,380
And I think that's an important distinction between medicine and public health, is that medicine is just so much more costly.

509
01:02:07,620 --> 01:02:10,710
And as a result, you know, doctors get paid a lot of money.

510
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:17,460
But we also have, just like these, spiraling out of control costs in our health care system here in the United States.

511
01:02:18,730 --> 01:02:24,700
And I think through this global health course, maybe I'll be able to introduce a few other countries which have been a bit better

512
01:02:25,030 --> 01:02:30,280
at focusing on these low cost interventions than these high cost interventions.

513
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:33,790
Because I think here in the US this, you know, we this is this is what we're focused on.

514
01:02:36,540 --> 01:02:41,370
Okay. So I want to take you through a tour of the history of global health.

515
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:54,720
So I would say for for many centuries, the government didn't really have like a huge thought about, you know, about the health of its citizens.

516
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:59,520
Maybe they were worried about like the health of soldiers on the battlefield, or maybe they were worried about,

517
01:02:59,850 --> 01:03:04,979
you know, large outbreaks of of disease if it was threatening, like the nobility or something.

518
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:11,700
But kind of starting in the Enlightenment era for thinking about like the development of modern nations,

519
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:18,420
there was sort of this this more of an obligation of countries to improve the health of their own citizenry.

520
01:03:19,620 --> 01:03:25,380
But with global health, we're thinking about, you know, are we concerned about the health of what's of the health of other countries?

521
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:32,790
Are we concerned about the health of other people? So in the history of global health, we're thinking about this word other a lot.

522
01:03:32,790 --> 01:03:38,609
And oftentimes that word other comes with it comes with like racism, it comes with thinking.

523
01:03:38,610 --> 01:03:43,350
People are different. It comes with people thinking that people might just naturally have a worse health status.

524
01:03:46,180 --> 01:03:49,299
We can think of some some subheadings for these terms.

525
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:57,430
So there's colonial medicine. And basically this is, you know, as European powers and as the United States was kind of developing their own empires,

526
01:03:57,430 --> 01:04:01,060
them and settling other places around the world.

527
01:04:01,590 --> 01:04:11,110
Uh, there was this thought that we need to control disease in these, uh, in these settings where our forces are.

528
01:04:11,110 --> 01:04:18,490
So, you know, like the United States trying to eliminate vector borne diseases in Panama built the Panama Canal.

529
01:04:18,850 --> 01:04:20,680
That's an example of colonial medicine.

530
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:31,629
Um, this is also thinking about, you know, the United Kingdom and France in Africa and dealing with a lot of infectious diseases like malaria.

531
01:04:31,630 --> 01:04:39,490
Like smallpox. Missionary medicine comes down to this idea that many of the.

532
01:04:40,780 --> 01:04:48,910
Early doctors who came from the United States or North America or Europe and went to other countries to work.

533
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:55,900
Many of them were sent through religious organizations, and I think many of them had very well-meaning.

534
01:04:58,740 --> 01:05:02,820
They had a good reason for doing something.

535
01:05:04,050 --> 01:05:12,450
But a lot of this also a lot of their work is it operates under the shadow of racism.

536
01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:17,070
It operates under the shadow of like maybe something is going on with people in Africa because they're heathen.

537
01:05:18,930 --> 01:05:24,840
And so there is a bit of a conflation of of sickness as this biological disease.

538
01:05:25,050 --> 01:05:28,680
And, you know, maybe people are sick because they're immoral.

539
01:05:30,530 --> 01:05:32,870
Tropical medicine is.

540
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:43,340
A more comprehensive term of just, you know, in tropical regions of the world, in places in South America, South and Southeast Asia and Africa.

541
01:05:44,570 --> 01:05:49,610
How can we improve the health of those populations through different medicine?

542
01:05:49,620 --> 01:05:56,480
So it's kind of like through some more heavy handed sanitary approaches, some hygiene approaches.

543
01:05:57,020 --> 01:06:01,790
What kind of medicine would you practice in, you know, in Nigeria versus in the United Kingdom?

544
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:09,780
So tropical medicine is a bit more of an archaic term, but some schools of public health still use it.

545
01:06:09,790 --> 01:06:15,580
So, for instance, the Tulane School of Public Health is officially called the School of Tropical Medicine.

546
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:17,909
There's the London School of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.

547
01:06:17,910 --> 01:06:22,709
So there's sort of historical reasons why some institutions still use this word tropical medicine.

548
01:06:22,710 --> 01:06:26,340
But tropical medicine really is a very physician dominated approach.

549
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:33,090
And then beyond that, we over time, kind of want to get rid of the word tropical because, you know,

550
01:06:33,090 --> 01:06:38,669
not everything it kind of makes it sound that like all this disease happens in these like jungles of Africa,

551
01:06:38,670 --> 01:06:44,350
but like people in temperate regions are totally fine. And that clearly is not the case.

552
01:06:44,370 --> 01:06:47,520
So we've kind of gone away from this word tropical medicine.

553
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:58,749
And the first word we came up with is international health. So international health was when people in Europe and North America wanted to

554
01:06:58,750 --> 01:07:01,840
improve health of individuals in what was considered developing countries.

555
01:07:02,290 --> 01:07:10,720
So basically it was like using money from the United States and in Europe to to implement certain interventions and some kind of like.

556
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:20,600
Very, very specific interventions. I think the smallpox eradication was an example of international health efforts, and it was you know,

557
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:28,100
it was it was people at the W.H.O. going around and running these studies in the Horn of Africa or in South Asia and

558
01:07:28,100 --> 01:07:33,889
seeing who still had smallpox and kind of having this heavy handed approach to vaccinating everybody in certain villages,

559
01:07:33,890 --> 01:07:36,980
if they if there still were smallpox outbreaks.

560
01:07:37,490 --> 01:07:40,970
But that was a success. We now don't have smallpox anymore, so that's great.

561
01:07:41,750 --> 01:07:47,120
But there have been a lot of failures of international health. One of them would be malaria eradication.

562
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:52,800
So around the fifties and sixties, there was also this idea that, like, you know, we're getting pretty successful at getting rid of smallpox.

563
01:07:52,820 --> 01:07:56,190
Why don't we get rid of malaria as well? Malaria spread through mosquitoes.

564
01:07:56,190 --> 01:08:01,220
So there is this idea that basically if you just spray DDT everywhere, you will get rid of the mosquitoes.

565
01:08:01,670 --> 01:08:08,630
And to some extent, we did pretty well in United States, but it just it was really hard to do this in many other countries.

566
01:08:09,290 --> 01:08:12,350
You know, there was a very devastating effect on wildlife as well.

567
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:19,819
So, you know, there's still malaria around today. And again, international health was very much a top down approach.

568
01:08:19,820 --> 01:08:25,160
It was very much, you know, the United States, Canada and Europe telling.

569
01:08:26,150 --> 01:08:33,200
All these other people, all these other countries, what they should be doing. It wasn't bidirectional in terms of of knowledge advancement.

570
01:08:35,510 --> 01:08:41,059
So we come to this idea of global health, and maybe global health is the word that is is great to use.

571
01:08:41,060 --> 01:08:47,060
Although I've heard some rumblings now that people even think that global health has some problematic implications.

572
01:08:47,060 --> 01:08:55,550
But smoothing that over, I would say in global health, what we are interested in is this idea that health operates on a global scale.

573
01:08:56,300 --> 01:09:04,070
So, you know, COVID 19 has spread not just within a country, but it crosses national boundaries.

574
01:09:04,940 --> 01:09:10,009
International health was very much focused on infectious diseases, but global health is comprehensive.

575
01:09:10,010 --> 01:09:16,430
We focus on infectious diseases. We focus on chronic diseases, and we focus on things like injuries, substance abuse, mental health.

576
01:09:18,050 --> 01:09:25,510
Global health is very interdisciplinary. I would say international health still was a pretty, you know, physician dominated by global health.

577
01:09:25,580 --> 01:09:28,820
We have our own field of public health, which is heavily involved.

578
01:09:29,150 --> 01:09:33,410
People in the social sciences, people, of course, in biomedicine are also welcome to contribute.

579
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:39,810
One of the big shifts between our national health and global health, though, is for global health.

580
01:09:40,140 --> 01:09:42,750
We want to work with locals.

581
01:09:43,050 --> 01:09:48,750
So in international health, if there are these programs, the smallpox eradication programs, they might work a bit with some local interpreters,

582
01:09:49,050 --> 01:09:52,290
but predominantly use, you know, doctors from, you know,

583
01:09:52,290 --> 01:09:58,800
Switzerland or the United Kingdom or America who are going over and running all these programs.

584
01:09:59,010 --> 01:10:02,790
But now in global health, what we think is, oh, maybe we should be relying on local expertise.

585
01:10:03,150 --> 01:10:09,010
So we are going to be working with physicians from India, physicians from Ethiopia and Somalia.

586
01:10:09,030 --> 01:10:13,560
They are the ones who are going to be having a lot of say in the running of these programs.

587
01:10:15,740 --> 01:10:18,379
And we also think that sustainability is a big a big thing.

588
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:27,440
So, you know, smallpox eradication was this wildfire where we spent all this money to eradicate smallpox.

589
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:30,980
But there is no real sustainable.

590
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:35,510
I mean, like we don't have smallpox anymore, so that's great. We don't need to vaccinate people anymore.

591
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:41,390
But there wasn't really a health care infrastructure which was left behind as a result of that eradication effort.

592
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:48,919
So with global health, we're thinking like, if we are doing something in another country, there should be able it should be sustainable.

593
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:54,260
It should result in an increase in health care infrastructure and it should have, you know, some viability long term.

594
01:10:56,880 --> 01:11:01,709
Okay. So this is how we use these terms in a contemporary setting.

595
01:11:01,710 --> 01:11:09,660
I think global health, it's thinking about, you know, we we think about the health of people regardless of where they're living in the world.

596
01:11:10,230 --> 01:11:20,969
International health generally was thinking about developing or low income countries and tropical medicine was I mean by its word,

597
01:11:20,970 --> 01:11:25,410
it was kind of more focused on tropical regions, but it was heavily dependent on physicians.

598
01:11:28,770 --> 01:11:36,630
Okay. How much time do we have left? Um, we do not have a lot of time left, so I will.

599
01:11:39,150 --> 01:11:47,170
Skip over this for now. But if you are viewing this recording asynchronously, please do read this and put it in your make up.

600
01:11:47,170 --> 01:11:53,350
But for people here in person who's not going to because I just have a few announcements that I want to make by the end of the class.

601
01:11:53,350 --> 01:11:58,270
But before that, any any questions about about this global health or national health tropical medicine.

602
01:12:02,260 --> 01:12:09,249
Okay. Again, like I mentioned, there is a study guide at the end of each each class.

603
01:12:09,250 --> 01:12:14,070
I think it's grade three. I'm not going to every day mention it, but I'm just mentioning it today.

604
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:20,800
Please do go through to make sure that you kind of have an understanding of what this means.

605
01:12:22,420 --> 01:12:27,820
There will be a recording from Panopto which shows up on campus sometime soon.

606
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:37,030
One thing I do want to mention is that we are part of a pilot program where the school is just automatically recording this.

607
01:12:37,780 --> 01:12:42,460
So I'm not like putting anything into Panopto. They're just automatically doing it this through the computer.

608
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:48,180
I mention that for a few reasons. One. If the Panopto recording doesn't work, I'll have somebody else to blame.

609
01:12:48,510 --> 01:12:54,329
But probably the bigger thing is that this is like constantly being recorded.

610
01:12:54,330 --> 01:13:01,890
And I think sometimes when I have a break, students will want to come up and they might like be talking about something which is a bit personal.

611
01:13:03,210 --> 01:13:07,500
I will try, if that's the case, to pause the recording,

612
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:13,170
although I'd recommend you to try to remind me to pause the recording if there is something that you want to tell me that was personal.

613
01:13:13,170 --> 01:13:20,660
But we were up here. But I just, you know, I just don't want that to show up on the recording if that is the case.

614
01:13:21,490 --> 01:13:27,980
Um, other things. Yeah. So, again, before discussion tomorrow, please view that debate.

615
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:31,790
It's only like 10 minutes long and fill out the google poll.

616
01:13:32,420 --> 01:13:38,870
Um, otherwise, I will stay up here at the front of the class in case any of you have any other questions.

617
01:13:38,870 --> 01:13:42,860
But have a wonderful weekend and I hope you enjoy your first discussion section.

618
01:13:57,470 --> 01:14:11,570
Yeah. All right.

619
01:14:12,270 --> 01:14:21,050
Well, thank you. I just want to talk about, like, getting more and stuff like that a little bit.

620
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:26,820
Is that like someone coming in from the area and, like, down the ladder or.

621
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:37,580
Yeah. So often it would be a lifelong, you know, missionary organization with medical volunteers and like, you know, so it actually is so by me.

622
01:14:37,580 --> 01:14:42,080
Sure. I mean this go and visit. Oh, so be like the Catholic Church.

623
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:46,300
And some of these people are actually going to be part of it.

624
01:14:46,310 --> 01:14:49,820
Like like, you know, they would have to go to the hospital. But they also.

625
01:14:52,310 --> 01:15:00,530
Thank you so much for. Thank you so much.

626
01:15:04,520 --> 01:15:13,520
Hello. Oh, I forgot to mention that, um, on Monday.

627
01:15:13,590 --> 01:15:25,060
But there is a textbook, but it's available on Google, so it's available across the library at five, 4 hours long.

628
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:29,840
Oh, yeah. So that should be in canvas already.

629
01:15:29,850 --> 01:15:40,620
So like for this, there'll be a link to the of the textbook and then you can read it on it.

630
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:46,830
Oh, no. It's like forever.

631
01:15:47,810 --> 01:15:51,870
I know. Yeah. Here, let me actually stop this, because we don't need this anymore.
