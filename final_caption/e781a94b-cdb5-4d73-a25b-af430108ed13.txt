1
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:07,550
Okay. Before we get started on the lightning talks.

2
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:13,830
Just one really quick update on the abstracts.

3
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,319
I just put these in the module for this this week.

4
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:25,530
It's their slides that were from a previous class like a month or so ago when I talked about this.

5
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:30,630
But just so you have it up front again, to recap the requirements for the abstract,

6
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:37,079
I have moved the due date for the abstract to November 18th and then the critiques to be due on the last day of class.

7
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,969
So everything's getting pushed back one week.

8
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:46,650
The reason for that is I don't really want to have something we do when I'm not here, so I'm not going to be here next Friday.

9
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:52,200
I'm going to be at Wayne State and Caitlin Fleming is going to give a research talk.

10
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,840
And so no lightning talks next week.

11
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:05,550
And yeah, so I wanted to make sure that, you know, I was here when the when the assignment was due just in case anything came up.

12
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:15,420
I have it all set up in critic, but I wanted to just run it by instructional services one more time before I make it go live and invite everybody.

13
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,990
So you should be getting an invite to like Monday.

14
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,729
I should be able to meet with them on Monday,

15
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:28,500
but otherwise you can like start working on the abstract if you haven't already in the absence of critique.

16
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:34,530
But that will be that will be you'll get an invite this week for that.

17
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,470
And this is just the additional components of the abstract assignment.

18
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:48,720
And this is a video on critic. Again, I already showed this, but I just wanted you to have it, you know, for this coming week,

19
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:56,400
I will post some examples of abstracts as well on the module for this week.

20
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:00,540
I'll do that over the weekend or possibly on Monday.

21
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:05,729
So you'll have some examples of abstracts just in case some of you aren't familiar with writing these.

22
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:11,370
And you need some to need to look at some examples. Does anybody have any questions about that?

23
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:23,819
Okay. So we have four lightning talks today and I'm not sure who wants to go first and I'll go first.

24
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:30,260
Yeah. Awesome. All right. I think I just oh, he did perfect.

25
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:35,730
I was like I was looking for earlier and I was like, Oh, crap. Did I lose that because I lose emails all the time?

26
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,170
I'm telling you this. So you were the last one that I was missing, so that's perfect.

27
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:48,180
Oh, you know what? I didn't send it to you as a person, so, like, I should have the slides put to you.

28
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:51,840
I don't know. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. You just want to, like, blow them up.

29
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:59,280
Yeah. Perfect recording.

30
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:05,720
Yeah. Yeah.

31
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:16,170
Okay. Okay.

32
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:25,340
Hello, everyone. My name is Jennifer Smith. I'm a first year physician student in some public health studying toxicology.

33
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:29,300
And I'm going to be talking to you guys about my undergraduate research.

34
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:33,890
If anyone has a neuro background, you know, these are angry, activated, microbial.

35
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:40,880
Yeah. Which plays into it'll be talking to you about the translation of prenatal stress to anxiety like behavior and adult offspring.

36
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:49,760
So background between 18 and or 18, 13% of women are diagnosed with anxiety during pregnancy,

37
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,740
and many more are already diagnosed by the time they are pregnant, making it a really prevalent issue.

38
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,159
This matters in the field of neuroscience and really everywhere,

39
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:02,510
because children whose mothers are exposed to very high amounts of stress during their

40
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:06,740
pregnancy are more likely to experience adverse neuropsychiatric outcomes in adult life.

41
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:13,010
And that can be anything ranging from anxiety and depression to autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia.

42
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:19,580
Mounting evidence coming from my previous lab and collaborators have suggested that the microbiome

43
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:24,500
as a key mediator in this translation from the mom's environment to the fetus's neural development.

44
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:30,950
So the big culprit that my lab wanted to look at was Cecile too.

45
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:36,440
And Cecile, too, is a chemokine that recruits leukocytes to propagate inflammatory responses.

46
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:45,020
It was a special interest because it crosses the blood brain barrier and B is in high protein concentrations in the placenta and the uterus.

47
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:49,910
So it seemed like a very good fit for something that could be contributing to this incidence.

48
00:04:50,570 --> 00:05:00,799
So this is the hypothesis directly from the paper. But summarize basically the question is how is or is Cecile to responsible for doing this

49
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,370
reorganization of girl development that's leading to these neuropsychiatric outcomes?

50
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:09,080
And how is the maternal gut microbiome contributing to Cecile to propagation?

51
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:14,959
So the study design, there's three different test conditions really.

52
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,310
It's the wild type, Cecile, to knockout and the germ free,

53
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:25,220
which just means we basically knocked out the microbiome and all of these have a stress and a non stress condition.

54
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:31,670
So then those are further subdivided. It's going to be a little convoluted, further subdivided into group one and Group two.

55
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:37,520
Group one was sacrificed gestational day 17 fetuses and dams were collected for tissues.

56
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:43,250
And then group two, they underwent patrician and behavioral testing that began at ten weeks.

57
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:49,009
So this is another helpful little diagram that could, I don't know,

58
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:56,540
explain some things that there was unclear methods for when we collected the tissues for group one.

59
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:04,040
We use a lot of flow cytometry to build the immune system profile and q PCR to look at relative concentrations of CCL two and Group two.

60
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:07,880
We did some sociability testing. I'm going to zero in on the novel preferences one.

61
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:15,440
This is basically where you have a mouse that's introduced to another mouse and there are a version for going near the novel.

62
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,280
Mouse indicates kind of how anxious they are, is the agreed upon method there.

63
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:24,200
So the results for group one, this is the more cellular molecular side of things.

64
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:28,910
They were really interesting in the placenta and the fetal brain.

65
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:37,570
We saw increased concentrations of CCL two in the stress model which is indicated there and then similarly in the germ free mice.

66
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:43,690
So the ones that basically had no microbiome at all, we saw the same rules, brutal.

67
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:51,670
So the germ free, germ free placenta in the stress model at higher concentrations and then the germ free fetal gland,

68
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:58,490
fetal brain also had higher concentrations. So that was group one and then group two.

69
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,320
This is my favorite figure of the paper.

70
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:09,260
Basically what happened here is we looked at the incidence of the mice that were stressed out, exposed to a novel mouse,

71
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:15,350
and it tried to see if they were more likely to interact with another mouse or less likely to interact with another mouse.

72
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:24,019
This one, the one that had a social to knock out, demonstrated basically no preference, indicating that it didn't make a difference.

73
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:31,730
It was kind of protected from this aversion behavior that we saw in the ones that had the CCL two present, which is indicated down here.

74
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:35,460
So we see the stressed ones in a way.

75
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,140
I'm sorry, I think I looked at around, but the same results still stand.

76
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:44,240
They are also indicated over here in the CCL to knock out offspring social behavior.

77
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:52,250
The social approach index for the stressed was a lot higher. So the discussion and future direction.

78
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:59,809
I thought that this was really good at linking a lot of things together that were confusing.

79
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:03,830
So it was the maternal microbiome to immune function, to fetal neural development.

80
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:11,030
Adult behavioral abnormalities is a lot to sink in at once, and I think the paper demonstrated positive associations.

81
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:17,550
However, the mechanism is still very elusive. We understand that Cecil, too, is responsible, at least in some part, for doing something.

82
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:24,630
But how it's happening, no one really understands yet. Obviously, this is of interest for possible therapeutic targets in the future.

83
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:30,270
Could we blunt Cecil, too, to maybe reduce the impacts of just a small stress?

84
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:34,110
Who knows? But I think that's a good direction to go in the future.

85
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:45,300
And that's it. Yes.

86
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:54,730
Can you explain and kind of spell out like what is the reason for comparing to a completely microbiome free mouse?

87
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:58,860
Yeah. Why would you include that as a compassionate group? Yeah, I really wanted to get into that.

88
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:08,430
But for the sake of time, I couldn't. So the thinking is that the microbiome was signaling to the immune system to increase CO two.

89
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:16,110
So if we wiped out the immune or the microbiome completely, then that signaling couldn't take place was the hypothesis.

90
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:27,120
Previous research indicated that actually I do have it on here, but I didn't mention that previous research from these guys,

91
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:36,479
we're close collaborators indicated that germ free mice didn't translate this averse social behavior when they were the fetuses or the children,

92
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,070
I guess, of stress dams. So we thought the microbiome was doing something.

93
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:44,400
And then CCL two seemed to be kind of the. The thing that it was doing.

94
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,170
Yes. Mm hmm. Thanks. Yeah. Hmm.

95
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,000
This is maybe a dumb question, but on your second to last slide, what are those images of?

96
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:58,170
Oh, I should have totally said that. Thank you for asking that question. This is a heat map.

97
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:02,600
So in this side, I actually don't know which is which.

98
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:06,600
I think they're labeled in the paper, in the information, the text.

99
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:12,839
But this is a heat map where the mouse is basically running around a chamber and the mouse is put in

100
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:17,280
one chamber and then the door opens and then there's another mouse that is locked in the chamber.

101
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:21,120
And this is showing how likely it was to go up to the novel mouse.

102
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:25,410
So it's showing where basically it was tracking. Yeah.

103
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:33,870
Thanks for that question. Question So what do you think is the source of the sea CO2?

104
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:42,040
Like if it's the microbiome has some weight because in the absence of microbiome, you don't see the sea CO2.

105
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:49,870
Yeah. Do you think is there like a certain species of bacteria that they are releasing this or.

106
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:53,889
I think that is a great question and something that we are really,

107
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:57,850
really close to and answering by around the time I started to leave the lab because I graduated,

108
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,720
we think it's being produced in the fetal liver, actually.

109
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:11,030
And the question is how it's getting to that point, because we saw really high concentrations of CO two RNA in the liver.

110
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:13,060
We think that's where it's being kind of transcribed.

111
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:18,640
But the protein concentrations in the blood weren't seen until after those those RNA levels fell.

112
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:25,210
That makes sense. So the thinking is the microbiome is initiating this production in the liver.

113
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:28,510
How is still a great question. So I have no idea.

114
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:33,310
But this seems to be the story that's kind of being pieced together, but it's not being produced in mom.

115
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,850
There's something that we do know. Yeah, that's right.

116
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:45,990
Yeah. And what's the stress signal to the microbiome and how how do they sense the stress of that?

117
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:49,930
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Stress and some sort of stress hormones or.

118
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:56,050
Yeah, I don't, I don't know. It's Yeah. A lot of lot to unpack there that I don't think we understand quite yet.

119
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:00,680
Yeah. Okay.

120
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:07,550
Thank you. Yeah.

121
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:18,180
It's like, okay, I kill yourself on something.

122
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:49,930
That's. Okay.

123
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:53,830
Should I start? Okay. Sorry. Now you're getting your title down.

124
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:55,909
I run. My name is Sahil.

125
00:12:55,910 --> 00:13:05,630
I'm a second year student in us, and my masters thesis is on the impact of extreme weather on mental health outcomes among the US elderly population.

126
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:12,350
So I'll jump into a little bit of background information. So we know that climate change has led to an increase in the frequency,

127
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:18,020
duration and intensity of extreme weather events, including heatwaves and hurricanes.

128
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:23,390
And we also know that the elderly are some of the most vulnerable to the health effects of extreme weather.

129
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:30,380
And these are the underlying factors to this condition are both medical and social in nature.

130
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:36,440
And there's been a lot of research devoted to how extreme weather affects physical health outcomes,

131
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,180
things like hospitalization rates or rates of cardiovascular disease.

132
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:47,150
But there's much less that's known about the mental and emotional health outcomes of exposure to extreme weather,

133
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:53,270
especially among the senior population. So that's what I really wanted to focus on for my master's thesis.

134
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:59,089
So the goal of my project is to determine how exposure to hurricanes and heat

135
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:04,760
waves or extreme weather impacts anxiety and depression among elderly individuals.

136
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:10,490
And my primary hypothesis is that exposure to these extreme weather events is associated

137
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:15,770
with an exacerbation of anxiety and depression based on the CD clinical model.

138
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:22,070
And we'll talk about each of those elements in the next couple slides. So how are we getting the data?

139
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:27,649
So all the data has already been collected through the University of Michigan Health and Retirement Study,

140
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:36,500
or s and this is a really nice cohort of over 20,000 older adults above the age of 50, and they're surveyed every other year.

141
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:44,660
And there's a lot of self-reported data, including indicators on well-being, including depression, anxiety, other mental health outcomes.

142
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:51,020
There's a good amount of information on emotional health, including social isolation and social support.

143
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:57,110
And what's really nice is that there's specific questions about an individual's exposure to extreme weather events,

144
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:01,940
including the location and time period during which they're exposed.

145
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:11,900
And then we mentioned the CD model a little bit earlier. So this is used to assess and quantify mental health disorders in epidemiological studies.

146
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:16,670
And what's really nice again is that these questions are integrated within the HRA surveys.

147
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:26,480
So we're able to assess an individual's mental health status before exposure to extreme weather as well as afterwards in subsequent surveys.

148
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:37,600
So this is just a schematic of the methods. So we have a and we have a group of individuals in us who have been exposed to extreme weather events,

149
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,300
and we can divide those individuals into two groups.

150
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:50,050
So the first group are people that have clinically defined depression or anxiety at the time that they were exposed to extreme weather.

151
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:55,870
And we can follow up with them over time in subsequent surveys and assess the changes in their

152
00:15:55,870 --> 00:16:00,700
depression or anxiety assessment scores based on the model that we talked about earlier.

153
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:08,680
And then the second group are individuals at the time of exposure who did not have clinically defined depression or anxiety.

154
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:16,390
But we can follow the same format. You can follow up with them over time to assess their changes in depression or anxiety.

155
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:21,410
And then we can also see if these individuals do develop depression or anxiety in the future.

156
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:28,180
And that will allow us to see the true effect of the exposure to a heat wave or a hurricane.

157
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:34,990
And I wanted to conclude by just talking about some of the future steps and why a study like this could be important.

158
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:41,590
So we know that the elderly population in the US is projected to nearly double in the next 40 years,

159
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:49,510
and that rapid population growth is going to coincide with the increasing impact of climate change on health and health delivery.

160
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:59,379
And I think one of my goals for this project is to identify both personal characteristics and community characteristics among elderly

161
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:07,600
people that may make them more resilient to extreme weather or may may make them more susceptible to a heat wave or a hurricane.

162
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:13,780
And then the ultimate goal of projects like mine, as well as similar studies,

163
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:22,120
is to provide resources and identify ways that we can support the mental health of the people who are most susceptible to extreme weather,

164
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:27,910
including the elderly population. So with that, that is my presentation.

165
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:32,950
Thank you so much for listening and I'll answer any questions you guys have.

166
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:42,850
Hey, great presentation. I think you're probably made before, but how do you define an extreme weather event?

167
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:52,150
Yeah. Yeah. So there are certain ways in which it's standardized, like a heat wave is standardized within a study.

168
00:17:52,150 --> 00:18:02,500
So for most studies, it's usually a period of two or more days in which the heat index is above the 95th percentile of that location.

169
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:13,600
So it is location specific, but we're able to collect where these individuals are living in the HRA survey and then we're able to access

170
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:21,249
weather data and other metrics in order to figure out when the heat waves are occurring and then yeah,

171
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:26,070
hurricanes or something similar. But that's usually something that, you know, you've experienced.

172
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:33,459
It's it's not as maybe rigid as a as a heat wave to kind of off of that.

173
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:37,390
Do you plan on like stratifying your analysis by type of extreme weather event?

174
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:46,780
Yeah. Yeah, exactly. So I can if I go back to the schematic here, we can conduct both of these groups,

175
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:52,150
but with like one once with hurricanes and then once with heat waves.

176
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:57,399
And then another thing that I wanted to mention and I just didn't have time for is that we're also going to

177
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:05,440
stratify based off of other variables because there are other confounders or affect modifiers like age,

178
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:13,090
socioeconomic status of there are a few others as well race, ethnicity,

179
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:21,730
gender and those all will affect your susceptibility to extreme weather as well as your susceptibility to developing depression.

180
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:29,740
So within our analysis and the binomial model that we have, we're going to stratify based on those to find a more true effect.

181
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:40,430
Any other questions? It was because I was learning the same thing.

182
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:44,510
Because as. Depression.

183
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:53,090
Is there like a bio? Is it more of a societal thing or a social thing that I'm trying to?

184
00:19:53,090 --> 00:20:01,210
I'm wondering if there is like a biological connection between, like heat exposure and depression,

185
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:11,090
like if it gets cold or if it's the heat exposure itself, I guess, or some other, you know, factor outside in your environment.

186
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:22,840
Yeah, I'm sure there are biological, you know, modifiers and certain biomarkers that you can look for that isn't really the goal of this study.

187
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:26,300
That's more on a community level or population level.

188
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:33,020
But but yeah, I think with I think it's a little bit easier to sort of visualize with the hurricane, for example.

189
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:39,550
So if a hurricane has destroyed your community or destroyed your home, then it's going to lead.

190
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:46,100
It's going to often lead to symptoms of depression or social isolation, loneliness.

191
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,610
And all of those can contribute to depression or anxiety,

192
00:20:49,610 --> 00:21:01,280
but it has a time element of it because they may not be as depressed like one year down the road compared to three years or five years.

193
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:05,900
So that's why we're focusing on that time lag with each of the groups.

194
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:15,230
Yeah. Yeah. One more question. Sure. So you are using clinically defined depression, I think generally.

195
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:22,910
But if there are people who might have like symptoms of depression or anxiety but are not clinically defined.

196
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:26,510
Yeah, they didn't go to doctor. Is that a way to account for that?

197
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:34,220
Yeah, that's one of the limitations of the study. There are definitely some limitations within us because it is self-reported data,

198
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:39,470
but that's also something that is difficult if people cannot access health care.

199
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:48,560
But just in order to standardize the process and the analysis of the data, we chose to focus on clinically defined depression, anxiety.

200
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:56,290
Do you mind just coming back to the future? Yeah, I just want to look at it again.

201
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:06,920
Okay. Sure. Was that a question? Your research includes the whole country and the whole.

202
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:13,570
Just natural disasters. I mean, for example, you talk about hurricane.

203
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:19,580
Tornadoes for Michigan, for example.

204
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:28,180
They have death. I don't know if you have tornadoes, but maybe snow storms or something.

205
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:32,740
Is that complete? Yeah. So I'm including hurricanes and heat waves.

206
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:39,210
And then the data that we're collecting from or the cohort is a nationally representative sample.

207
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:42,890
But we know that hurricanes only typically affect the coastal regions.

208
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:47,680
But heat waves are something that's a little bit more ubiquitous throughout the country,

209
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:53,590
because I think every state in the country is experiencing extreme heat in some degree.

210
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,560
So that's something that is a little bit more standardized.

211
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:02,979
But with hurricanes, I just wanted a different metric or a different sort of factor with extreme weather.

212
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:06,330
So those are the two that I'm focusing on for this study.

213
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:12,040
But there are other studies that are similar that are focused on tornadoes, on droughts and flooding.

214
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:20,570
So, yeah. Thank you. Of course. There's only, like, freezing cold weather, and the snowstorms are depressing.

215
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:33,420
Thank you. This. I.

216
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,569
All right. Hello, everyone. My name is John Miller.

217
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:09,410
I am a first year MCI student and I'm going to talk about my research interest specifically in cancer toxicology.

218
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:19,490
So I haven't done my own research, unfortunately. So I decided to do a talk on a paper that I have an interest in.

219
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:27,080
So some background. So vinyl chloride monomers are pulverized to polyvinyl chloride, which is uv-c.

220
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:30,560
And this is used in the plastics industry, especially for piping.

221
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:36,950
And then polyvinyl fluoride is also used in the plastics industry and we see a lot in light

222
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:41,930
coating of the bottom of airplanes to make them non-flammable and then in metal sheeting.

223
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:47,570
So these vinyl halide monomers are associated with injuries or coma of the liver.

224
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:55,640
So once you're exposed to vinyl halide, they're absorbed through the lungs and then rapidly metabolized in the liver.

225
00:24:56,930 --> 00:25:02,870
So these vinyl highlights, once in the liver, can induce the formation of DNA attacks such as Epsilon GI.

226
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:13,860
So in this paper, researchers wanted to test how exactly exposure to vinyl chloride affected the formation and repair of these DNA attacks.

227
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:23,610
So then rats were exposed to zero ten, 100 or 110, 1100 ppm up fluoride for either five days or four weeks.

228
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:33,510
And then kind of a sister experiment. Rats and mice were also exposed to zero 25 to 50 or 2500 ppm of unemployed for a 12 month period.

229
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:42,549
And they found that the number of attacks increased very significantly as the exposed dose of these bottle hairlines,

230
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:51,459
either run of fluoride or vinyl fluoride increased. So, for example, with 110 PM found fluoride in the four week period,

231
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:55,930
there was a 25 fold increase in the Epsilon GI attacks compared to the control rats.

232
00:25:57,130 --> 00:26:01,360
So there was a very high correlation between the Epsilon G attack formation at 12 months

233
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:06,580
of exposure to Varna fluoride and then the incidence of NGO sarcoma at two years.

234
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:14,290
So the researchers demonstrated that the target cell population for NGO Tacoma, which is the non parenchymal cells,

235
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:23,140
contained more epsilon GI attacks than hepatocytes, even though the vinyl halide metabolites are formed in the parasites and a diffuse to non muscles.

236
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:32,020
So they concluded from this experiment that only hepatocytes had induction of DNA repair expression

237
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:37,059
after exposure to mono fluoride and the non Franco muscles did not indicating that the target cells for

238
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:43,360
vinyl haloed carcinogenesis are the non parenchymal cells and they had a lot of lower expression of

239
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:49,570
the DNA repair enzyme associated with epsilon g out of repair of after exposure to the vinyl halos.

240
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:55,990
And then there was the reference there. So how does this relate to something I want to do?

241
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:00,100
I'm hoping to go into cancer toxicology research.

242
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:04,000
So I'd like to find other products and plastics that can cause cancer.

243
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:12,339
And then once you find those products, how to limit the exposure to those carcinogens and potentially create regulations on ways

244
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:19,360
to make form plastics without carcinogens and then ultimately ways to prevent cancer.

245
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:29,410
And that's it. Any questions?

246
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:42,320
Yeah. So the doors that they use in the experiment like is that similar to what we as humans are exposed to every day?

247
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:50,929
I'm actually not sure. I think they just kind of chose arbitrary numbers that like are similar to what humans are exposed to.

248
00:27:50,930 --> 00:28:00,649
But it really depends on if you're exposed to those type of plastics or like the funnel highlights because there

249
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:06,680
was a previous experiment that they kind of like talked about and this as well where they did a like a study,

250
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:13,220
an epidemiological study with workers in the industry that were creating these plastics.

251
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:18,110
And so they were exposed to, I would say like higher than this.

252
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:27,150
But yeah, I think you. Do you have a particular class of chemicals or chemicals that you're interested in?

253
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:32,280
I'm not really not like the chemical side. I just have an interest in, like, sarcoma.

254
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:36,510
So, yeah, just things that can cause coma.

255
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:41,070
Do you do you have a is there a reason why you're interested in sarcoma?

256
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,790
I've had, like, family members about it. Yeah, I.

257
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:56,759
The reason I ask is because my post-doc was in Ewing Sarcoma, and I joined the lab because I had a strong I have a strong family history.

258
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:04,200
Can you not if not sarcoma but but a lot of sarcoma researchers were brought into the field because yeah,

259
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:08,280
they had sarcoma themselves or their family members. So.

260
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:22,420
Thank you. Thank you. Take.

261
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:38,570
Oh, right. That. Okay. So, yeah, I started. I wasn't sure how to.

262
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:47,250
I think I can just log in. It wasn't letting me.

263
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,210
Okay. Just like Carl.

264
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:21,140
Hmm. Hmm. See.

265
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:40,640
Sorry. Yeah, I'm doing the same thing to me.

266
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,480
And I was like, I thought you'd be. I was just because I didn't have access.

267
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:48,390
Oh, okay. Okay.

268
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:05,640
Okay. Hmm.

269
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:14,879
Okay. Hi, everyone. My name is Nella. I'm a second year med student in IHS and my thesis is looking at the impacts of a trichloroethylene

270
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:21,870
metabolite CV C on immune processes and a macrophage so model and then implications of that for pregnancy.

271
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:31,710
Some background on trichloroethylene is a volatile organic solvent that's used to manufacture refrigerants and as a metal degreaser.

272
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:36,330
It's a common environmental contaminant so is soluble in water.

273
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:39,959
So has the potential to contaminate a lot of groundwater systems.

274
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:46,350
And then also it's been detected in ambient air and is a common hazard in occupational settings.

275
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:52,050
And then there are 18 Superfund sites in Puerto Rico related to drinking water contamination.

276
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:56,550
And trichloroethylene is one of those Superfund chemicals of concern.

277
00:31:56,850 --> 00:32:01,290
And then Puerto Rico also has higher rates of preterm birth and adverse pregnancy outcomes.

278
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:07,499
So my research is through this protect project that's looking for associations between the

279
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:14,200
Superfund chemicals and this adverse pregnancy outcomes relevance for pregnant women.

280
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:22,320
So this study from the very late nineties was looking at female and male volunteers that were exposed to the occupational exposure limit

281
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:31,560
of 100 parts per million of this metabolite of trichloroethylene and females had peak blood concentrations of 13.4 in the animal female.

282
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:38,760
So we know that it gets into the female blood supply and then trichloroethylene used to be used as an anesthetic during the labor.

283
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:43,979
And when it was being used, they were able to detect it in the umbilical vein and in the arteries.

284
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:46,050
So we know that it can cross the placenta.

285
00:32:50,000 --> 00:33:01,610
Past studies by Dr. Bolden now have shown that DC is suppressing the immune response to LTA and that has implications for pregnancy.

286
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:09,770
She used this fetal membrane model, so using the like amniotic layers, she took x plants of that and expose them to DC,

287
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:16,970
DC and then stimulated inflammation with LTA and you see this suppression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines release.

288
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:24,859
So suppression of the immune response in the mother is problematic because that can increase susceptibility to infectious

289
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:31,700
diseases during pregnancy and that can lead to a premature rupture of that fetal membrane and that can lead to preterm birth.

290
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:41,330
So my research plan, my first aim was a bioinformatics approach, and part of that was looking at gene set enrichment analysis data.

291
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:48,740
And I took out pathways that were corresponding to each level of each step of phagocytosis to see if any one step in particular

292
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:57,020
was being impacted by its kind of like across the board suppression of a lot of genes that were associated with phagocytosis.

293
00:33:58,130 --> 00:34:01,220
And then my second aim was looking at those dynamics of D.

294
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:08,710
I was interested to use different stimulators of inflammation that were associated with other common intrauterine infections.

295
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:12,080
So LTA had already been used by Dr. Baldwin.

296
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:17,230
As I use it again, it's mimicking Group B step and then LPs for E coli.

297
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:22,580
That's kind of the number one cause of UTIs in pregnant women and the and which is

298
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:27,079
mimicking a yeast infection and all three acts through slightly different pathways.

299
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:32,600
So that's kind of why I was interested to see if CVC would have different impacts on them.

300
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:37,190
And I use this macrophage cell model. I had a controlled DCB C treatment,

301
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:45,660
I used six different concentration concentrations and then stimulated inflammation which each with each of these and then yeah,

302
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:49,040
had CBC plus the inflammatory stimulator.

303
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:57,049
And then my results have shown this kind of dose dependent suppression of TNF alpha release.

304
00:34:57,050 --> 00:35:01,130
And then I'm also sending my samples to the Immunology Court to look at other

305
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:08,300
M1 pro-inflammatory cytokines enzyme as I was and follows the same trend.

306
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:12,680
My graphs I just locked in graph pad and I can't open it on my computer.

307
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:18,560
And then my last aim is going to look at the CBC impacts on phagocytosis.

308
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:25,790
So actually running an assay to test phagocytosis itself because we see that it's been impacted at the transcriptomic level.

309
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:34,240
So trying to see if it's actually been impacted. Conclusions and future directions.

310
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:42,020
So my thesis is looking at the effects of different intrauterine infections on DC, DC.

311
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:47,980
We see impacts on that response. And then looking at how CBC is impacting phagocytosis.

312
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:58,360
Future directions could be to look at these CBC impacts and say the kinds associated with end to macrophages or the anti inflammatory phenotype.

313
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:03,100
And then also looking at other metabolites of trichloroethylene.

314
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:18,070
Since. Yes.

315
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:24,850
Did you look at the immune system of of just for normal or also the disease, too?

316
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:29,230
I'm just looking at like a cell line. Oh, yeah.

317
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:37,110
So, yeah, cause I know it's like something related to my previous research, but, um,

318
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:41,730
we saw a lot of immune suppression in the womb and then an immune upregulation and.

319
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:49,000
I was just curious, like, I wonder if that was similar for the CDC to where you see that suppression?

320
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:54,040
Yeah, there's the present virus. But the virus is experiencing actually immune regulation.

321
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:59,749
Yeah. Yeah.

322
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:03,770
That's what I was wondering, is if you think this is primarily a pro-inflammatory thing,

323
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:11,420
like it's causing some inappropriate inflammation or that it is inhibiting the normal healthy immune response.

324
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:16,190
Yeah, I think it's like mostly suppressing the immune response.

325
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:19,700
Um, which I don't know.

326
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:28,729
I know my, um, pi Dr. Harris has like presented this data to cancer researchers and they're like, Oh, that could be interesting.

327
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:34,430
Like drug food and cancer, but just because it can suppress the immune response.

328
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:42,520
Um. Yeah. Yes. Can you just expand a little bit on your aim for you, like what you expect to find?

329
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:52,240
Yeah, I think I'm going to find that. So I'll have to each of us teach one sales that we're exposed to DC, DC and then some without.

330
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:56,110
And then I'm labeling ggb acid this fluorescent dye.

331
00:37:56,830 --> 00:38:01,899
So then I'll have my exposed macrophages and then we're not exposed with the guards.

332
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,630
I'm thinking that they're not exposed.

333
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:12,430
Well, actually, phagocytosis and I'll see that fluorescence and then the exposed cells block phagocytosis as much as they'll be less fluorescence.

334
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:17,410
Okay, I'm labeling them tomorrow, so we'll see how it goes.

335
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:27,190
Good luck. Sorry if I missed this, but are you using is that just a is it's a controller blast.

336
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:31,360
So I'm using thp ones also macrophages.

337
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:38,110
I was interested in macrophages just because of their role in pregnancy in the fetal membrane model.

338
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:43,150
Like there's a lot of cell types in there. So trying to look at the cell type specific responses.

339
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:49,090
Okay, so you're using the the macrophages, so you're just treating the macrophages with the DC.

340
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:52,870
Yeah. Like cytokine release. Yeah.

341
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:56,260
Yeah. So there's also implications in other areas of the body too.

342
00:38:56,830 --> 00:39:00,340
I was just trying to focus in on reproductive health insurance.

343
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:08,709
Yes. Okay. Have you ever considered looking at other immune cells that are sort of active and like that

344
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:17,430
type of immune response because they're cells that know not really just because they get time.

345
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:22,690
Um, but yeah, I think that could be an interesting thing going forward.

346
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:26,200
Yeah, I was just wondering if you might have already said this.

347
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:35,290
What if there is a specific tissue or function focusing on like in the broader scheme or if this is just like immune system generally?

348
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:41,890
Yeah. I mean, the fetal membrane model that Dr. Bold now uses,

349
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:51,130
like kind of what I was going off of and then just looking at macrophages that would be present in the placenta during pregnancy.

350
00:39:51,160 --> 00:40:00,560
So. Yes.

351
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:06,860
And she also there is love, so and so this is like not where your ex acted, right?

352
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:11,029
Like you were looking to see if you have a preterm birth,

353
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:16,700
which would be an upregulation if information that results in like premature rupture of the membranes.

354
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:24,000
So that's why I was confused about like early on in it, because you would think that like suppress it,

355
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:27,919
suppression of the immune response would be like kind of better for your preterm birth.

356
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:33,860
But I think if I understand it or my understanding of it is that suppressing the immune response can

357
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:40,490
increase susceptibility of the mother to like other infectious diseases and intrauterine infection.

358
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:46,810
And then you wouldn't have that immune response. So then the infection could just keep getting worse until like you would have like

359
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:53,180
this influx of an immune response and just like not great outcomes for the fetus.

360
00:40:53,600 --> 00:41:02,309
So you're also like capturing like cell populations. It's like the bacteria that you're exposing your culture to to see like those concentrations

361
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:05,310
are increasing and that you're also seeing this immune response suppression.

362
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:15,390
Um. Sorry, can you repeat? Yeah. Sorry. So you're exposing three different types of bacteria or you have in one of your genes, right?

363
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:21,010
Exposed. Yes. Well, not bacteria. Just like components of the other.

364
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:30,770
So, like. Yeah. And then I guess the question would be like, if you did expose like an actual bacterium to these macrophages and in, you know,

365
00:41:30,770 --> 00:41:32,870
already that you've seen in years long suppression,

366
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:41,610
could you potentially also count like counts to see if that is increasing because you're seeing immune response suppression?

367
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:49,490
And yeah, that's something that I was going to maybe do with my like GBS growth curve for my third aim.

368
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:57,890
I haven't done yet just like Compare or GBS in the presence of GBS alone to see if they would like grow differently.

369
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:05,850
But I haven't done that. Yeah. Can.

370
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:14,280
Thanks so much for all of the speakers. Yeah.

371
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:24,479
So I figured out how I have to figure out how to set up the Panopto recording.

372
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:30,360
Or I might do a zoom. Like, Caitlin will be here in person, but I'd like to record the talk, so I'll figure that.

373
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:36,690
I'll figure those details out. But she'll be here and then I will be back two weeks from today.

374
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:42,570
So does anybody have any last minute questions or comments or anything?

375
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,820
Otherwise, have a good weekend and I will see you all in a couple of weeks.

376
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:48,570
Let me know if you need anything in the meantime.
