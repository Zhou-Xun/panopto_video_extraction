1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:06,290
In these next two modules, we're going to be talking about skills for supporting students through distress and crisis.

2
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:11,600
So we're going to talk about everyday situations, minor things that you might be noticing,

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:23,090
and then we're also going to talk about how to have a conversation with students when you're seeing them potentially in a crisis situation.

4
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:26,540
So this is the cycle we're going to use, we're going gonna go through each step,

5
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:33,250
but you'll kind of notice that you start and observe, and all the way to post-process and then the cycle may start again.

6
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:42,440
So this is just what we'll be working our way through. So the first step is just noticing what behaviors you're seeing.

7
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:49,850
And for this, you may want to go back to the module where we talked about what mental health looks like on the continuum.

8
00:00:49,850 --> 00:01:00,990
And so what are those behaviors in the yellow range, the just kind of getting by, and what is or what are the behaviors in the struggling part of

9
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:08,910
the continuum that you're seeing? So you want to be really clear about that in your mind.

10
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:14,520
And then you also just want to manage and check any assumptions that are coming up. When you start the conversation with the student,

11
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:22,710
you want it to be from a place of just openness and curiosity, not assuming that you know what it would mean.

12
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:27,720
An example of that, at the time that I'm filming this, is during Ramadan.

13
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,320
And so a student may be fasting and perfectly normal,

14
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:39,010
no distress, but because of that, might be more tired, more fatigued.

15
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:45,230
Might decide not to be on camera, in Zoom as much. And

16
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:51,710
checking in, makes sense. Just making sure that they're doing okay, but not assuming that it means depression,

17
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:57,590
not assuming that it means anything else. And just knowing that there's people of so many different identities,

18
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:00,860
so many different experiences, we have no idea what's happening in their everyday lives.

19
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:09,580
We don't want to make assumptions, but we do want to know specifically what we're seeing, because that helps further the conversation.

20
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:18,920
The next part is checking in. And here you want to communicate with the student in a way that gives them as much privacy as possible.

21
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:23,810
So ideally, it's not in a Zoom meeting with other people or saying what's going on?

22
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:33,020
Why isn't your your camera on? If that was important in the moment, then you might want to check in, in the chat privately.

23
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:39,020
But you want to try to give them as much of a sense of safety and privacy when you're checking in.

24
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:43,700
And then you also want to remain calm, warm and nonjudgmental.

25
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:51,290
So an important piece of this, too, is and this goes back to what we talked about in the beginning about knowing how you feel about mental health.

26
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:58,270
People are going to read our anxiety and it's normal to have some anxiety when we're talking about difficult things.

27
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:08,200
But checking in with our body, doing our own breathing, our own grounding so that we can approach with curiosity, warmth,

28
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:13,130
and calm. And just kind of going into it, assuming that whatever comes up,

29
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:19,890
you guys are going to be able to figure it out together or you're going to get them the resources that you need to help.

30
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:27,030
So some examples of checking in are, I've noticed you've missed meetings, or assignments, or ,you know, fill in the blank

31
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:33,280
what you've noticed lately, and I just want to check in and see how you're doing.

32
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,020
Another example would be, I'm concerned, you haven't seemed like yourself lately,

33
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:42,460
how are you? And you just kind of see what comes from there. You want it to be

34
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:56,940
usually a pretty open question and oftentimes, it helps to kind of indicate what you're seeing, that's leading to seeing this worry.

35
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:06,120
You also want to keep in mind, that you're giving them room to tell you as much or not as they want to,

36
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:14,720
but the tone is important. It's not like why weren't you in class? But it's more like this is what I've noticed and I'm kind of concerned.

37
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,600
The next step, is you want to communicate, understanding and support.

38
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:25,440
And so sometimes it's important to just say, repeat back what they're saying.

39
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,530
So it's like, you know, I'm hearing that overall it's been hard to adjust to the program a little bit,

40
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:35,410
and then there's also these stressors that are happening at home,

41
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:38,760
and it's making you question if this is the right place for you to be, right?

42
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:45,140
Like that may be kind of your summary of what you heard and then you might say, you know, am I getting that right?

43
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:48,890
Am I missing anything? And just by doing that,

44
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:55,820
you're conveying that you want to know, and it matters that you're hearing correctly and it

45
00:04:55,820 --> 00:05:03,350
gives them a chance to let you know anything that might not have been understood correctly.

46
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:08,500
You also want to normalize that difficulty happens in life, but difficultly

47
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:17,960
doesn't mean anything bad about you. And so that might be where you just kind of say things like, that sounds really intense,

48
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:23,330
that sounds really painful, overwhelming, you know, kind of pick a word that makes sense.

49
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:28,580
And then, you know, you could say something like, anybody going through all of that could be having a hard time.

50
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:34,750
And so you're you're normalizing that difficulty is common, now

51
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:40,250
granted, if the situation is really an outlier, you don't want to normalize something

52
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:47,170
that's not. But the fact that they're having a hard time with it, is probably pretty normal.

53
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:50,410
So those are things to kind of think about, and with all of this

54
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:55,450
I really encourage you to practice it, and find the wording that comes naturally for you,

55
00:05:55,450 --> 00:06:01,180
because the more that you practice it, role play it with somebody, no matter how silly that may seem,

56
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:08,410
the more likely that in the moment you're going to just kind of find the words that feel really genuine and relaxed.

57
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:16,190
You want to try to communicate empathy, and there's a great Brene Brown video on empathy that we can make available to you.

58
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:24,510
But it's just basically like, you're a human and I'm a human, and I may not understand all of it, but I really care.

59
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:31,170
You want to express the longing, often when especially in high achievement settings, when we're having difficulty, we start to wonder

60
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:36,890
am I supposed to be here? And if it makes sense, you want to clarify that, that

61
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:43,660
like, we're supported here. Difficulty is okay, let's figure out how to

62
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:56,460
help you through it. And again, where possible, you want to express hope. This isn't toxic positivity, everything's got to be fine, but you're just acknowledging that

63
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:00,300
probably together, you guys can kind of find a way through this, even if it takes a while.

64
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:05,010
Some examples are. I know this feels awful right now,

65
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:09,060
or I know this may feel awful for a while.

66
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:18,360
But my hope is that we can find some options to make it more bearable as you're going through this, to help support you as you're going through this.

67
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:28,440
Another option might be I know a lot of this has no quick and easy solutions, but would it help to, then you fill in the blank.

68
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:38,210
It might be you communicating something to the program for them, but you just you want them to know that

69
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:50,490
you get that moment is difficult, but that you are hopeful that together you guys are going to find some ways to help them get through it.

70
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:59,070
And then you just want to ask open questions. Number one, to see if there are pieces of it that you're missing,

71
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:04,900
and also, start generating ideas about where to go from here.

72
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:09,310
So some examples of this might be, what you need right now?

73
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:14,230
How can I support you? If this person seems to be having a hard time generating that,

74
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:17,950
you might want to think of a few things to offer and it may be some thinking of,

75
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:23,510
yes to that, and no to that. Is there anything I can do right now to help?

76
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:28,300
And I will often talk with students, especially when they are overwhelmed about like, you don't have to figure out the whole next week,

77
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:32,330
let's just figure out today. We don't even have to like,

78
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:36,120
what do you need right now? Sometimes that's as simple as like,

79
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:42,070
I need to just go take a nap and reset. I need to go have this difficult conversation.

80
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:47,400
I need to eat. I need to slow down and breathe.

81
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:53,770
So you're kind of in the moment, you're not usually at this point trying to generate long term strategies.

82
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:54,440
So we're going to,

83
00:08:54,440 --> 00:09:05,480
in this module here and in the next module, we're going talk about some of the tougher questions that can be related to, that's about self harm and suicide.
