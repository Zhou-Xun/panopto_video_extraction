1
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:16,210
I don't think it's good. But I can't.

2
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:30,910
And. Okay.

3
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:17,000
That's right. Good morning, everyone.

4
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:26,659
Today we will talk about random variability and statistical inference.

5
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:30,230
And guess as I may have mentioned in the beginning.

6
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,000
As epidemiologists, we are really not very concerned with this.

7
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:46,430
Uh, uh, and I guess that that's one of the difference between the epidemiologic and the statistical thing.

8
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:58,519
So it's it's important, I guess, and we do have to know about it and surely we need to report it in every single study that we can that,

9
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:04,670
that, um, is, is just one aspect of causal inference that.

10
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:18,080
Whereas perhaps you not have so much weight. So again, to remind you where we have been and where we are.

11
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:22,260
So this is part of those problems in the making.

12
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:38,610
Of course, in France we have been through these first four and in fact, these four can actually be defined or classified as what constitutes bias.

13
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:47,670
What we will be discussing to the chance is really not bias and we will see why and what's the difference.

14
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:56,940
All right. So you see what dangers they and this is what we will be discussing.

15
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:03,390
That difference. First of all, that difference between bias and random variation or chance.

16
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:09,360
Then we will discuss the difference between identification and estimation.

17
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:15,330
Then we will talk about random variability and how do we deal with it.

18
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:21,580
At least how do we quantified? And there are two ways of doing it.

19
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:28,800
The first is hypothesis testing, and perhaps you have been through that in in biostatistics.

20
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:40,990
So I will give you. My take from an epidemiologist point of view and then will talk about statistical estimation, which by the way, is our.

21
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:50,630
As a pediatrician. Our favorite way of quantifying random variable as opposed to hypotheses this.

22
00:03:52,020 --> 00:04:04,440
Okay. You ready? Well, so far we have been concerned with bias in the identification of it.

23
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,420
Causality and bias.

24
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:18,570
You know that the first four problems we went through in the first like is actually systematic error in the identification of a causal event.

25
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:28,290
So suppose let's go back to that bullseye schematic and suppose that the center of the bull's eye represents that causal effect.

26
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:33,990
For example, the difference in the counterfactual probabilities are two levels of exposure.

27
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:41,800
That's a that's a causal effect, right? Now in our imperfect.

28
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:46,400
Human tools that we have available in real life.

29
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:51,050
We attempt to measure that that causal effect.

30
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:58,100
So if this was the result of every time we attempt to identify.

31
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,160
These. Causality.

32
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:09,520
You will see that the distance will always be greater than zero.

33
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:13,170
Right? So every attempt will be biased.

34
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:20,520
We will be systematically missing. The value of that causal effect and.

35
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:26,550
I guess as an example, I have routine real life notation, right?

36
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:34,920
Um, so, you know, conditional probabilities for actually exposed or unexposed people and these

37
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:42,030
so I index represents every time we attempt to estimate this causal effect,

38
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:48,120
you could think of those attempts, let's say, as each one being a study.

39
00:05:49,290 --> 00:06:02,220
So if you were able to conduct a study many times to try to identify a causal effect, you know, you might be in this situation.

40
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:14,710
And this is kind of a fancy way to summarize mathematically.

41
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,620
A fear not. I will not. In quiz you on this.

42
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:26,420
But this is basically the difference between the value of the actual causal effect and the value we get.

43
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:32,629
At every attempt with our imperfect methods. And obviously that difference will always be different.

44
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:36,530
The different from zero. Right. And you can see it here.

45
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:39,560
There is a distance, right.

46
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:45,170
It would be zero if, you know, these points were always here.

47
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:52,150
But they are not. They are systematically away and always actually in the same direction.

48
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,940
So it is a systematic error or bias.

49
00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:07,440
Now. If there is no bias and every time you try to attempt your attempt to make sure that you actually got it.

50
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:11,920
You would say that the causal effect is identifiable.

51
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:21,070
Identify it. So identify ability is the absence of bias in.

52
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:33,080
In an attempt to measure a causal effect.

53
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:52,380
But. Even in the absence of bias, our measure may not necessarily represent the underlying causal effect parameter due to random variation,

54
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:56,460
but luck we might have perfect methods.

55
00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:02,790
But again, we might still miss the parameter of interest.

56
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:15,580
And you may recall this from the very first nature. If we could include everybody in the population to try to estimate a parameter and.

57
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:17,380
That would be.

58
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:27,950
Everybody in the population would be if we could actually do a study in a super population, we would be attempting to measure that parameter directly.

59
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:35,030
Right. Because we would be skipping one of the steps that you may remember we illustrated here, which was the sampling.

60
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:42,300
Right. Those parameters have also a synonym.

61
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:54,280
They are also called estimates. But in real life, you know, we can never really include everybody in that population in a study.

62
00:08:54,550 --> 00:09:04,750
So, in fact, we always have to pursue a sampling procedure to take just a few people, select a few people from the population to our study.

63
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:09,760
And then on those people, we administer measurement procedures.

64
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:20,070
So because we can never measure the parameter directly, we always try to estimate the parameter,

65
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:26,310
and we do so by calculating what's called a point estimate.

66
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:34,430
And point estimate, which are our attempts with our humanly available imperfect measures.

67
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:43,330
I noted with a little hat. Have you seen this happen before in those states?

68
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:48,390
Right. So this is, I guess, from where we have led.

69
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:53,840
We have been talking about what it fits. And.

70
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,680
Pretty much everything that that that we measure really should have a hat.

71
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:00,340
We just.

72
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:14,980
You know, because everything has to be decided not to put the hats on anymore, but a proportion, um, and mean, uh, accumulating means is reached.

73
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:23,650
Anything any of the measures that we have been through should really have a happen because they are estimates points.

74
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:30,100
Now, if we could conduct the same study several times.

75
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:34,650
And each time we have to sample people.

76
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:44,280
The actual people that we get for each of those iterations of the same study might be different.

77
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:56,190
So we might get a different point estimate each time in each study because the people that we have sampled for this study are the.

78
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:05,130
And that's the definition of chance. We get a different result because we sample different people.

79
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:25,190
So going back to the Mosaic schematic, you may recall that when we have this situation in which we miss the bull's eye,

80
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:32,450
which represents the parameter, but with every attempt at unique, we miss it in a different direction.

81
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:47,630
That's the definition of random error or chance. Now, the larger our sample with respect to the super population,

82
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:56,660
the smaller would be the difference between the point estimate obtained at every attempt of measuring and the parameter.

83
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:03,810
If we could include everybody in this population, there will be no.

84
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,760
Differences in our estimates due to chance.

85
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:14,910
To chance, right. Because we will always be sampling the same people, everybody in the super population.

86
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,250
But again, that is usually not the case.

87
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:30,030
From a theoretical point of view, if that were the case, if we were able to include everybody in in this population in our study.

88
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:35,900
Our point estimate will always. Be right.

89
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:45,660
And we would say that our point estimate would be consistent with the estimate or consistent with the parameter.

90
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:54,690
This type of consistency has nothing to do with the consistency we talked about in Cyprus again.

91
00:12:55,020 --> 00:13:01,050
It is another unfortunate situation where they have given the same name to two completely different concepts.

92
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:11,250
This consistency is just a matter of comparing the value of point estimate with the value of the parameter in theory,

93
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:16,050
because situation in which you could make sure everybody knew population you didn't have to sample.

94
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:21,379
Okay. So again,

95
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:34,220
if we represent a parameter here with a probability the estimation attempt would need to have they had because there um again point estimates.

96
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:44,990
And the random error could be defined as the difference between the value of the parameter and the value we obtain every time we tried to.

97
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:54,330
That parameter in a study. So it would be the distance, for example, between the center of the bull's eye and each.

98
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:59,880
Black note that represents. A measurement attempt.

99
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:11,760
Okay. This difference for each attempt.

100
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:23,580
This difference is the distance or the random error associated with that attempt to estimate the prime question for you if if you have sort of.

101
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:38,780
Um. Assimilated the notation here. These means some over right, some over I and I means every time we conducted a study, the same study,

102
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:46,580
to make sure the parameter was the difference between the actual that was the less the value of the

103
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:52,070
some of the difference between the actual value of the parameter and every attempt at measuring it.

104
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:57,130
If. This is a situation where should this value be?

105
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:14,600
Zero. It should be zero. Why? Because in absolute terms, sometimes we might get an answer that's at both the value of the parameter.

106
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:19,730
Sometimes we might get an answer that's below the value of the parameter.

107
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,270
Sometimes we might actually get the same value as the parameter.

108
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:27,980
But if we add up those differences, they should cancel out.

109
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:35,420
So the expected value of random error so defined should be zero.

110
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:44,790
Okay. Now let's go back to real life where we can actually only go that one relatively small step.

111
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:52,940
So in those small studies. Our own estimate might actually be quite far from the Paramount.

112
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:07,640
And again, that is due to this step in our research process, which involves sampling from our super population.

113
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:19,110
The way in which this sampling affects. Our ability to estimate the parameter depends on the study design.

114
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:31,450
In observational studies. The difference in the value of the estimate we get depends on the actual people

115
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:35,799
that we get to select every time we were to conduct the hypothetical study.

116
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:48,610
Many, many, many times. Right. So, you know, if in this class I wanted to, you know, study something like sleep deprivation and flunking the.

117
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:58,540
Final tally, Gruber. So let's say I want to study that question with 20 students.

118
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:07,290
I could use some. Random program to select 20 students, and I would conduct my study there and get one value right.

119
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:18,029
I could repeat this study and I would again as the roster through a random selection program, I would get 20 students.

120
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:21,870
But chances are you are not going to be the same as the first 20 students.

121
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:28,100
Right? Some might be, but if it's truly randomly selected my sampling, I would get a different.

122
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:36,650
A group of students. And it's like that because it's just a different group of students.

123
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:47,389
The point estimate that you get from that new group of technicians is different from the number I got from the first 20 students.

124
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:53,480
A sum. That's what I'm talking about when I say, you know, hypothetically repeating is that in many many.

125
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:02,550
So, you know, because I would make sure to do this study without bias.

126
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:11,260
I could. Assume that. The difference in the value.

127
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:23,209
Of my estimate. Between the Institute of Fair Study and let's say is that if we included the whole class and the

128
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:28,940
difference between the value in the second study and that for the whole class due to chance.

129
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:39,460
But look. Okay. In randomized trials the mechanism.

130
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:53,020
Is is different, but. It also depends on the date, on the on the actual people that I select to conduct my study.

131
00:18:54,290 --> 00:19:05,560
So if. Um, you know, instead of an observational study, I wanted to conduct a randomized trial in this class and, let's say, effect of providing.

132
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:12,770
Cookies before definer with. The grades in my course evaluation.

133
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:20,960
It's been done actually many times, not by me. There is a research group that's devoted to that very important research, by the way.

134
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:25,070
They have shown that evaluations are totally useless and totally run.

135
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:30,650
But I'm not discouraging. They always bring it up.

136
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:39,650
But let's say I want to do you know, cookies might get expensive, so I may not be able to randomize the whole class.

137
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:45,860
The whole place is my super population. So I'm going to take again a sample of first 20 students and I'm going to randomize them.

138
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:52,520
You know, maybe ten of them to get cookies and the other ten to just get maybe thank you or something.

139
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:59,610
Um, you know, and I run my study and I look up the values of my evaluation.

140
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:08,910
Um, so, you know, I might get a difference in my evaluation scores between people who got cookies and those who did not.

141
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:19,350
Um, and if I, you know, if I, for the sake of the example, I could repeat my experiment and I would sample again another 20 students.

142
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:27,210
But because what those new 20 students are very likely different from the first 20 students that I select.

143
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:34,170
I do my experiment with the second group of 20 students, and chances are never better.

144
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:45,810
Chances are that the difference in my evaluation is caught between the cookie and no cookie group in the second study is different from that.

145
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:57,530
I obtained in the first three. The actual reason in the context of a randomized trial is a little bit more complicated.

146
00:20:57,530 --> 00:21:04,219
And I can just mention it for you not to scare you, but I don't know.

147
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:11,600
I just feel compelled to tell you the truth. So it depends.

148
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:18,800
Do you remember the causal types? There were four causal types.

149
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,480
There were some that were called doomed that you were very amused by.

150
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:36,970
No, there's that word called immune. And it depends on on how people behave, what the individual causal effects could be for given people.

151
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:46,300
So there are four types of people, right, depending on whether they react or not, to being contractually exposed to a given exposure.

152
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:55,360
So the difference is in the point estimates that I would get for a causal effect in an ideal randomized trial you

153
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:03,760
do sampling would depend on differences in the distribution of the for causal types between my sample groups.

154
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:11,760
So if. If in the. In the if in the first group there are more doomed people.

155
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:18,030
Meaning? Well, I guess I would be the doomed one because I would get, let's say, poor evaluations regardless of whether.

156
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:23,960
Or people will give me poor evaluations regardless of whether they get a cookie or not.

157
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:30,320
And there are, let's say, you know. The highest percentage in that group.

158
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:34,430
Then there are doomed people in the second group.

159
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:41,240
That is the reason why. The point estimates will differ between the two groups.

160
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,350
And why would there be?

161
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:53,380
A different distribution of do people immune people or you know really because unprotected in the first and the second group white why.

162
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:58,480
Okay. Yes. That's not just.

163
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:11,970
Especially. And guess what? Let's say if I decide to decrease the size of my groups instead of 20 for this trial, I do then.

164
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,829
Am I more or less likely to get differences in?

165
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:21,090
The point is these more like so in this case?

166
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:26,730
This is where we need to be concerned with the size of our sample.

167
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:36,510
So the smaller the size, the more likely we are to get we are at, the more likely we are to get differences due to chance.

168
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:47,790
How do we deal with random variability? Well, there are two ways. The first one is hypothesis testing.

169
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:55,879
You may have heard these. Now we seem for statistical significance and this secondly, statistical estimation.

170
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,040
So we will go through each one.

171
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:07,190
The first one is hypothesis, and this is basically really not the way to deal with it, but mostly to quantify it, quantify chance.

172
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:14,360
So hypothesis testing relies on the formulation of a study question in the form of a null hypothesis.

173
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:19,940
Now let's say, uh, two variables.

174
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:26,960
The exposure and the outcome are not associated in the super population from which the sample was randomly obtained.

175
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,240
That note that the null hypothesis is.

176
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:38,090
Formulated with respect to what's going on in the super population.

177
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:49,660
Okay. So for racial measures, ratio measures mean cumulative incidence ratio odds ratio incidence rate ratio.

178
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:56,120
Multiplicative risk. The expected value under the null hypothesis for, let's say,

179
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:02,209
differences between exposed and unexposed in terms of outcome is what the probability

180
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:07,100
or the rate of the outcome is going to be the same in the exposed and unexposed.

181
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:12,309
And if you divide the numbers, you should get one right? For nefarious measures.

182
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:17,410
Additive scale. Cumulative incidence difference or difference?

183
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:25,110
You have to see. No, you're wrong. There is no such thing as a difference of opinion.

184
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,340
It is rate difference, right? You must have seen a difference.

185
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,610
Main difference. The expected value under the null is for the outcome.

186
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:42,400
Exposure level is. You should be this, right?

187
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:54,630
No. Hypothesis testing assumes that each measure of association follows a probability distribution.

188
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:56,010
Hmm. What does that mean?

189
00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:05,970
That means if you are again to conduct this study many, many, many times, chances are every time you will get a different answer.

190
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:14,380
And if you were actually to collect that answer, that value of the ratio or the mean differences or whatever,

191
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:22,260
and let's say put it on a dataset in which the idea is the study that you have

192
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:27,510
conducted and the variable is the value of your measure of association that you obtain.

193
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:37,520
In the absence of bias, you were to plot those values you obtained each time you did the study you would get.

194
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:43,680
Something that's not a call. You would get a distribution.

195
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:51,870
For example, if you were. Studying a mean difference.

196
00:26:54,230 --> 00:27:02,540
You remember that example of difference in height between breast cancer cases and non breast cancer controls?

197
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:09,410
If you were to conduct that the same study many, many, many times and you recorded their result,

198
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:14,390
the difference in mean between cases and controls and you plotted.

199
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:21,170
They or do you need a histogram or something of those values?

200
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:29,060
The point estimate you would get a normal distribution. So that's what this means.

201
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:41,500
That's a probability distribution. Now the normal distribution is obviously a well known and well described mathematical function.

202
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:47,120
There is even a formula for that. Right. What was the was the value?

203
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:51,650
Of of any distribution the area under the curve.

204
00:27:52,610 --> 00:28:03,680
What? Right. Yeah, exactly. And because you have an 80 under the curve and because it's well-described.

205
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:17,250
Statistically. You could actually estimate probabilities of being above or under any point in that distribution.

206
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:21,500
You just have to plug in numbers in a formula, right?

207
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:29,120
So that brings us to this concept of the test statistics.

208
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:37,630
So it was the test that. Let's continue that example of doing a.

209
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:43,260
Study comparing heights for people with and without breast cancer.

210
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:47,700
So we had a distribution of heights, right?

211
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:55,170
So height differences, what you would have on the x axis of your distribution is height differences.

212
00:28:56,550 --> 00:29:02,070
How do you compute the probability that the probability of being.

213
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:07,160
And then Arabo were given cut point of the.

214
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:13,270
Probability distribution when you have. Let's see.

215
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:25,490
Values of height. Well, you have to convert those values of height or if they were of a cumulative incidence ratio or whatever values,

216
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:39,260
you have to convert them to units. That proportional to the actual distribution that has a value of the area under the curve of what?

217
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:50,570
You know what I'm saying? You have absolute values that, you know, obviously depend on exactly what your question is.

218
00:29:53,170 --> 00:30:04,440
But in order to estimate. Probabilities or sizes of areas and then or above given cut points of that distribution.

219
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:16,380
You need to convert those arbitrary values belonging to whatever measure you are employing into a common.

220
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:24,900
Scale that corresponds to the well known mathematical distribution with the total area under the curve of one.

221
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:41,720
And the way to do that actually is to apply this canonical formula, which means it can be used pretty much for any distribution.

222
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:52,490
It's actually an approximation of the normal distribution, sort of regardless of the actual.

223
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:59,300
Uh, estimate that that that you have the shape, the form of this.

224
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:14,750
So. That formula to convert the values of your estimate into those general probability values for an area under the of one is equal to.

225
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:20,630
The measure obtained in your study.

226
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:33,680
Minus the expected value of that measure under the null hypothesis, and that is square divided by the variance.

227
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:39,370
Of. The value you obtain under the null hypothesis.

228
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:52,909
And that number, once it is converted, follows what's called a Chi Square distribution.

229
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:58,550
So Chi Square distribution is one of those probability distribution with the known function.

230
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:08,090
Yes. You can.

231
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:36,280
And. Right.

232
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:41,880
Okay. Let me try to to translate the question.

233
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:47,150
So. How is the area under the curve created?

234
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:52,370
This. Yes.

235
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:59,270
Well, again, if you are able to conduct this study many times.

236
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:04,370
And you recorded the value of the estimate you got.

237
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,550
Let's say a mean difference or a cumulative incidence ratio.

238
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:16,230
Or another reason you recorded it. And you were to do a histogram of the values you got from every study.

239
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:21,560
You would get a distribution and that distribution can be described.

240
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:26,190
With a well known mathematical function.

241
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:37,960
Now the actual mathematical function will in fact depend on the type of measurement that you are obtaining.

242
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:45,790
If you are obtaining a mean, it is very likely that that distribution will be normal.

243
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:56,410
If you are obtaining a proportion based measure like equality ratio, you may follow something called a Bernoulli.

244
00:33:56,410 --> 00:34:01,960
Distribution is not necessarily known, right? And then.

245
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:09,630
Because the actual numbers of the measure that you get depend on the actual

246
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:16,470
measure and depend on the size of your effect or attempt to estimate an effect.

247
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:21,340
You have to translate those values into a.

248
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:30,370
The language of the mathematical function. Right.

249
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:47,820
So. Basically if on the x axis of your rotator you had values from, uh, you know, if you are estimating a probability, you should have values from.

250
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:53,390
Zero two. Well, that's a bad example.

251
00:34:53,450 --> 00:35:00,290
If you if they're estimating a mean difference, you could have values from, I don't know, blood pressure.

252
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:08,370
Add to. 200.

253
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:21,600
Right. Those were all values are not helpful for you to do any calculation of the probability of being, let's say.

254
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:28,180
Having a value of 90 and their day. Area of the distribution.

255
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,470
You cannot do it.

256
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:42,260
You have to translate those values from 80 to 200 that are distributed saner in a Gaussian curve into the scale of the version curve,

257
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:46,280
which goes just from minus infinity to infinity.

258
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:50,510
And it should be centered at zero. Right?

259
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:05,760
Aha. Okay. Okay. If I understand your question, I think is a very good one.

260
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:13,860
We have to assume we have to assume that our data follows.

261
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:18,580
One or another. Distribution is a good question.

262
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:24,460
I'm sorry I did not catch you at first, but thank you for your patience.

263
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:31,160
So. Again with continuous data.

264
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:40,370
Often times you can assume. That the estimates would follow a normal distribution with proportions.

265
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:46,040
You can assume that they follow binomial or Bernoulli distribution.

266
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:53,600
And so on. Grates. Is there anybody here? Is there any mathematical statistician?

267
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:57,530
Yeah. You. Where distribution.

268
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:01,720
Do rates follow? Watson. Yeah.

269
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:06,970
That's why we love gin. But you see, it is exactly that dance.

270
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:16,050
So every. Every type of measure has an underlying distribution that people believe they follow.

271
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:23,400
And it's not that they just believe. I mean, they have done, obviously, studies and to figure out the distribution level.

272
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:32,979
Okay. But again, regardless of the distribution or distributions,

273
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:39,640
sort of as a as a generic mathematical formulation, have a value of one, a total value of one.

274
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:46,540
And your job is to translate the arbitrary values that you get from your study into that scale.

275
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:52,250
Of a total value of one. Okay.

276
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:58,620
Any other questions? Good questions.

277
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,300
Yeah. You write?

278
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:13,090
So this is the way to translate that. Into that sort of universal scale of a distribution with a total.

279
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:28,580
Value of one. And those probabilities that we could estimate the probabilities of being at a given.

280
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:35,900
Location of. The probability function.

281
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:46,740
Could be. Um, or have been extended to this concept.

282
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:53,430
Of the P-value. So the P value is one of those probabilities with a with a very specific definition.

283
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:06,690
And the specific definition for day or use of the people use that using that this statistic value.

284
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:14,579
We estimate the probability from the distribution function that related with the value under the null hypothesis.

285
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:18,580
So the p value. He's the probability.

286
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:25,510
Assuming that the null hypothesis is true of obtaining a result as far from

287
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:32,320
the value and the null or further than one than what was actually obtained.

288
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:35,330
And. I you know,

289
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:51,560
when I was doing my basic bios that actually I had a will to there would be the GSA who made us recite these like ten times during this session.

290
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:57,390
I mean, I'm not going to do that. I'm going to do something nicer, actually.

291
00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:11,650
Let's see. These works. It is key to know what value means.

292
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:16,360
The chance with the know you obtain data that at least had extreme.

293
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:28,420
Yes. So this is from this Larry Lester, who is a mathematician, I guess, from Texas or something.

294
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:33,490
But yeah, I was hoping that this would.

295
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:39,100
It is key to know what p value means is the chance.

296
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:42,850
With the know you obtain data that at least had extreme.

297
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:48,380
How true. All right.

298
00:40:54,070 --> 00:41:00,110
So exam. And again, you know.

299
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:08,740
This is one of those things that's actually more important to know what the P value is not.

300
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:18,330
Right than what it is, so to speak. There is no other definition or interpretation of the people.

301
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:24,500
But the song. And if you are not into singing this,

302
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:31,260
the probability assuming that the null hypothesis is true of obtaining a result as

303
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:37,800
far from the value under the null for further than what was actually obtained.

304
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:45,340
Heck was the nickname of that GSA unforgettable hack.

305
00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:56,120
All right. There is no deviations from that.

306
00:41:57,260 --> 00:42:04,710
Definition. Sorry, no deviations. No alternative explanations, no different wording?

307
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:10,730
No. We are stuck. All right. Yes.

308
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:18,200
That's the awful truth when an investigator hypothesizes that the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency.

309
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:30,540
V d d serum levels of vitamin D is then 50 almost per liter is different in girls living in Juneau,

310
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:36,180
Alaska than in the general US population of girls the same age.

311
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:44,120
Anybody from Juneau, Alaska here. Every five years or so, you get somebody.

312
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:49,340
They get very excited about this. So anybody who's been to Juneau, Alaska.

313
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:58,320
How is it? Exactly.

314
00:42:58,590 --> 00:43:02,940
So this is why I chose this example, because.

315
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:06,780
Juneau, Alaska. Is one of the.

316
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:12,600
Uh, then cities with the least. Uh.

317
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:17,450
Sunday's. In the US of a.

318
00:43:18,570 --> 00:43:27,440
Uh. But don't feel envious because he's also in that top ten one year a.

319
00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:32,820
You know, I grew up in a tropical setting, so this is very tough for me.

320
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:40,110
And one year, I counted the days I went without seeing the sun in this city and.

321
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:50,720
For those of you who are newly arrived, maybe I shouldn't. But anyway, so the investigator conducts a survey in a random sample.

322
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:57,590
Let's say 50% of all girls 5 to 9 years registered in the city's primary schools.

323
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:04,700
So the sample size is 243 girls and measures the vitamin D levels.

324
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:12,870
Okay. The investigator finds that 40% of girls in her study have vitamin D deficiency.

325
00:44:13,870 --> 00:44:19,030
You know, again, to continue with this operation Vitamin D, you obtain from the sun primarily.

326
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:24,130
And if there is no sun in Juno, but you would get this problem right.

327
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:37,130
So the investigator knows that among girls 5 to 9 years old, in the whole of the US, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is only 28%.

328
00:44:37,430 --> 00:44:45,260
These are real data. So the hypothesis could be set up like this.

329
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:50,760
The alternative hypothesis could be the prevalence of vitamin deficiency in general goes.

330
00:44:52,260 --> 00:45:01,830
Let's call it B one is not different from the prevalence in the general population of girls the same age in the US.

331
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:13,680
It's not like so with the summary notation that they don't think the null hypothesis excuse me is that P one equals Bina, right.

332
00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:19,750
There is no difference between those two. References.

333
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:26,139
And the alternative is that the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in these girls from,

334
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:31,060
you know, V one is different from the prevalence in the general population.

335
00:45:32,550 --> 00:45:38,420
You know. So what we have to do is to compute that this statistic.

336
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:44,060
I brought back this formula here. We are going to plug in the numbers as to what they mean.

337
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:48,620
X would be the estimated prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in general.

338
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:55,070
Girls. So I wrote the hat here for p 1.4, right.

339
00:45:55,370 --> 00:45:58,700
As the value that the investigator got when she's the experiment.

340
00:46:01,270 --> 00:46:05,830
The expected value of the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and their dental.

341
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:11,170
Well needs to be. The prevalence in the US.

342
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:19,630
Right. If there was no difference between those, what you would expect in you would be to get the same prevalence as it is everywhere else.

343
00:46:20,090 --> 00:46:28,659
Point 20. And the variance would be the variance of the estimated prevalence in this study when the underlying

344
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:34,780
prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in Juneau Girls is equal to that in the general population.

345
00:46:35,990 --> 00:46:47,310
And again, this is where you have to know. What distribution, your estimates, the scale of your estimates are supposed to follow.

346
00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:56,220
So proportions typically follow the standard binomial distribution so they don't follow the normal distribution,

347
00:46:57,150 --> 00:46:58,889
they don't strictly follow the percentage.

348
00:46:58,890 --> 00:47:07,680
Although you can use the percent as an approximation, they really follow the binomial and each of these distributions has their own variance.

349
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:15,890
This is the variance of the binomial distribution. Three times, one minus B divided by the sample size.

350
00:47:17,150 --> 00:47:23,590
So you just plug in the numbers here. For the variants and you get the.

351
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:29,670
A small number is is the variance for that. Rebellions and their denial.

352
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:41,170
And now you plug in the rest of the numbers, get the numerator beat .4. 28 squared divided by the variance and this is 17.36.

353
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:51,680
That's the statistic. And that's the value on the x axis of the distribution.

354
00:47:55,040 --> 00:48:04,860
Was the probability. On square distribution that you get a value.

355
00:48:05,490 --> 00:48:15,080
The statistic of 17.36. That probability is 0.00003.

356
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:21,130
And as a people. Was the interpretation.

357
00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:25,180
So here is where we plug in the words from the song.

358
00:48:25,210 --> 00:48:32,960
The lyrics. If the null hypothesis were true, the probability that a given study of, you know,

359
00:48:32,970 --> 00:48:46,200
girls may give a prevalence as different or more different from the US population prevalence than what was observed is 0.003%.

360
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:54,800
Is exactly the same wording. So I say sort of, for one, you know, deviations from that word.

361
00:48:56,390 --> 00:49:03,250
Guess you may be wondering why we never see these wording in any paper that we read as an interpretation of the p value.

362
00:49:04,270 --> 00:49:08,680
Well, I don't know. And I don't want to.

363
00:49:11,070 --> 00:49:20,130
So as you probably know by now and arbitrarily to use that point to the clear, statistically significant is .05 rate or 5%.

364
00:49:22,350 --> 00:49:28,530
So people some times very often save the people use less than what we know.

365
00:49:28,530 --> 00:49:34,020
Five. You can declare that your findings are statistically significant.

366
00:49:34,650 --> 00:49:41,760
That's what you find in the papers. But mind you, what people mean is this.

367
00:49:44,570 --> 00:49:48,810
Okay. No.

368
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:52,770
This is my favorite part. What the p value is not.

369
00:49:53,770 --> 00:49:57,730
So what are the misinterpretations of the Bible?

370
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:06,910
Well, there are many. They brought you some of the most common, such as the probability that the null hypothesis is not true.

371
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:17,230
Or that the alternative is true. That's impossible because that implies a comparison with an underlying parameter.

372
00:50:17,470 --> 00:50:23,320
And this is not what the P value is doing. You know, from what we have discussed so far, at any stretch of the imagination can be.

373
00:50:25,850 --> 00:50:32,780
Or that the probability that the estimate does not equal the parameter of interest.

374
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:36,920
That's not what the P value was.

375
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:48,920
Again, the p value is only a concept that needs to be understood under the hypothetical scenario in which you were able to conduct a study many times.

376
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:50,600
The same study many times.

377
00:50:52,650 --> 00:51:00,930
And was the probability of getting a result that is as extreme or more extreme than the one you saw in the one study that you conduct.

378
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:07,970
Has nothing to do with the. Estimation or hitting the actual true paramount.

379
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:22,680
And here is an example from real life. You can get one pretty much every time you read the health news or results from research from the media.

380
00:51:24,390 --> 00:51:29,670
But this is sort of an interesting case study.

381
00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:41,589
So there was an investigator, uh, professor at Cornell, Brian Wansink, maybe the nutrition students familiar with the case.

382
00:51:41,590 --> 00:51:44,680
And, and he was there. He was a superstar.

383
00:51:44,690 --> 00:51:48,820
I actually met him at my prior institution.

384
00:51:48,830 --> 00:51:56,170
You know, he had a have a very. Sally and Department of Nutrition.

385
00:51:56,170 --> 00:52:00,160
Andy They invited all these big shots every week to give a seminar.

386
00:52:00,430 --> 00:52:08,370
One time they invited Brian Wansink. So and he was doing really, really fascinating research.

387
00:52:08,610 --> 00:52:12,090
He's his field was. Um.

388
00:52:15,310 --> 00:52:19,420
What was the psychology of of of eating?

389
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:25,480
And how do we read, for example, environmental clues about.

390
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:38,170
The amount of food that we eat and what the interplay of that with our actual eating and, you know, problems like the obesity epidemic.

391
00:52:39,070 --> 00:52:50,850
So. One of his perhaps his most famous study was one on the endless Super Bowl.

392
00:52:52,720 --> 00:53:05,620
So he. He invented a bowl, you know, that would never empty itself because he connected it to a.

393
00:53:06,830 --> 00:53:14,330
Little holes that keep pumping in soup and it always kept at the same level.

394
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:23,060
So the experiments he would do is he would pick a sample of students and see them at the table and.

395
00:53:25,090 --> 00:53:29,260
Serve them, you know, some soup. And maybe it was lunchtime or some.

396
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:34,760
And they would start eating. But again, the ball will always keep at the same level.

397
00:53:35,630 --> 00:53:42,500
And guess what? If you do that and you keep the bowl full, people never stop eating.

398
00:53:43,610 --> 00:53:53,090
They lose the clue of satiety. And they obviously well, at some point, I suppose, you know, they may be super full, even even studious.

399
00:53:53,810 --> 00:53:57,290
Um, yeah, it's, um, if you can fill them up.

400
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:04,330
Um, but obviously they would eat way, way, way more than that anyway.

401
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:14,270
And that, that would actually made him worth of, of one ignoble price, you know, about the IG Nobel Prizes.

402
00:54:15,290 --> 00:54:19,760
So so you know that the Nobel Prizes are announced the first week of October.

403
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:27,260
So sometime in late September, there is a committee that also announces the IG Nobel Prizes,

404
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:34,670
which is are prizes to the most fascinating and interesting research that may be sort of completely free.

405
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:40,370
But yeah, it is like a party of some of the.

406
00:54:41,590 --> 00:54:50,410
You know, I know the IG Nobel Prize was to some investigators that discovered the mechanism why woodpeckers never get headaches.

407
00:54:53,170 --> 00:55:08,140
Right. But unfortunately for Brian Wansink, I guess he fell in disgrace because he was caught cheating in his research.

408
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:14,730
That was very disappointing. He was caught on a practice called P hacking.

409
00:55:15,630 --> 00:55:20,340
Which is basically to manipulate your data.

410
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:28,290
Uh. At the analytical stage until you get the lowest possible p value.

411
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:37,050
And that is very dishonest thing to do. Especially when, you know, statistics and email.

412
00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:46,270
But in a story about that that situation, they they they mention this example.

413
00:55:47,590 --> 00:55:51,850
About it. They were trying to describe or to give a definition of the people.

414
00:55:52,750 --> 00:56:01,629
For example, if you go on a diet, the people, you can estimate the chance that the weight you lost was the result of natural

415
00:56:01,630 --> 00:56:07,450
background fluctuations in your weight as opposed to because of your new diet.

416
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:14,520
So this obviously has absolutely nothing to do with the definition I gave you to begin with.

417
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:18,569
This is referring to individual causal effects. It's not about you.

418
00:56:18,570 --> 00:56:22,860
You, you, you. What is the variability on individual causal effects?

419
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:27,200
If we could estimate. Zero.

420
00:56:28,530 --> 00:56:33,330
If we ignore quantum mechanics, we will always get the same result.

421
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:39,870
So there's not possibly a good description of the building. If you were to translate, these are the population level,

422
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:51,300
I guess at best is that this is describing the P-value as a probability that the the null hypothesis is true or that the alternative is not right.

423
00:56:51,720 --> 00:57:01,360
So, Eric, uh, I know you will be able to read this news with a critical eye and have a little laugh on me.

424
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:11,010
Ha, ha. Look, there are many limitations to using the p value in testing your hypothesis.

425
00:57:11,030 --> 00:57:17,600
One is that it does not give you any indication of the direction or the magnitude of the association.

426
00:57:18,050 --> 00:57:25,310
So if you have an association based only on the p value, you are not providing the most important information,

427
00:57:25,310 --> 00:57:29,390
which is whether your intervention is killing or saving babies.

428
00:57:30,340 --> 00:57:37,510
What do you think is more important to know whether the intervention is killing or saving babies or whether the result has a low p value?

429
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:44,040
Yeah. I think they they're killing is probably more important.

430
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:47,660
You want to kill no babies. Zero babies. Right.

431
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:50,990
Even if the P-value is very low. Yeah.

432
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:55,040
So that's more important. This is why I have insisted that for us, epidemiology is.

433
00:57:56,440 --> 00:58:02,989
This is not very key. The most important thing is things like direction magnitude of the association.

434
00:58:02,990 --> 00:58:14,340
That said. And that's because you look at the formula of that is is that this statistic the numerator is squared.

435
00:58:15,980 --> 00:58:20,420
And the numerator is what, for example, should be telling you the direction of the association.

436
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:26,149
But if you squared the difference in the direction of the association, you only get a positive number.

437
00:58:26,150 --> 00:58:29,000
So you will never know what do they do right?

438
00:58:32,170 --> 00:58:38,710
It also doesn't give you any information about a range of possible values that might be compatible or consistent with the parameter.

439
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:49,250
There's just a single. I need doesn't give you information about something called the power of study.

440
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:54,650
The part of a study. Is a probability of.

441
00:58:55,930 --> 00:59:06,000
Being able to detect. An estimate of a given size, depending on your sample size and some other statistical assumptions.

442
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:15,950
So he doesn't give you any information about that. Because it is strongly, depending on the size of this study.

443
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:23,720
So you may have a study, you know, now with big data stuff and working on it's a population register.

444
00:59:23,730 --> 00:59:27,000
You know, you may have a study with 1 million people.

445
00:59:27,990 --> 00:59:33,660
And you might have a cumulative incidence ratio of 1.0.

446
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:44,020
Two because you have 1 million people. The p value corresponding to that estimate, 1.02 is going to be very low.

447
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:47,600
So you will have a very significant result. It's.

448
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:54,660
A point estimate ratio of 1.0 to really impressive.

449
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:00,280
2% increase in risk. He's not.

450
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:07,950
He's not. So. So the p value in that case would be really uninformative.

451
01:00:10,630 --> 01:00:18,160
Okay. So instead of that, actually, we prefer these other approaches, statistical estimation.

452
01:00:19,870 --> 01:00:27,400
Basically consists of quantifying the confidence we have on point estimates as a function of the population size from which they arise.

453
01:00:29,950 --> 01:00:34,300
This is a measure of the precision of an.

454
01:00:37,430 --> 01:00:41,809
So obviously it makes more sense to have more confidence on estimates that come

455
01:00:41,810 --> 01:00:45,230
from a larger population than from estimates that come from a smaller population.

456
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:53,330
And this estimation is achieved with the computation of confidence intervals.

457
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:58,460
So confidence interval is composed of two numbers, right?

458
01:00:59,430 --> 01:01:02,430
That typically surround or that always surround.

459
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:12,880
Your point is things. Do you have a point estimate and then you will calculate a lower bound for the point estimate and an upper bound for the points.

460
01:01:13,710 --> 01:01:20,130
And that range represents your confidence on the estimate.

461
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:23,210
And will see confidence with respect to what?

462
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:35,280
So this the computation of the confidence interval has this canonical form where x is the value of the measure.

463
01:01:35,910 --> 01:01:41,620
You estimated the new study. These one minus alpha.

464
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:51,430
Divided by two is the percentile of the standard distribution that you choose to have your level of confidence on.

465
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:59,440
Typically, you pick between all five. In other words, you typically estimate the 95% confidence interval.

466
01:01:59,470 --> 01:02:05,740
I mean, you can also estimate the 99% confidence interval, which will give you more confidence.

467
01:02:09,370 --> 01:02:12,520
But I guess conventionally we estimate the 95%.

468
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:17,430
And the violence. Is there estimated violence of your.

469
01:02:19,990 --> 01:02:27,130
Your point is. Now what is the interpretation of the confidence interval, in other words?

470
01:02:28,210 --> 01:02:31,810
What does it give us confidence about?

471
01:02:34,410 --> 01:02:37,710
And this is very moving because the confidence interval.

472
01:02:38,860 --> 01:02:44,080
Gives us confidence about what extent are pointing out our range.

473
01:02:45,870 --> 01:02:49,010
Actually covers the parameter of interest.

474
01:02:50,730 --> 01:02:57,600
So as opposed to the P-value, the confidence interval has everything to do with the actual parameter we are trying to estimate.

475
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:08,200
And I mean, it could have it has a relation with the.

476
01:03:09,540 --> 01:03:19,950
Statistical significance in that. It includes the ratio values of the parameter that would not be rejected at the level you pick.

477
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:23,430
Which corresponds to the level of significance.

478
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:32,640
So a 95% confidence interval should be compatible with a P value point for significance of point or faith or 5%,

479
01:03:33,060 --> 01:03:38,010
except that the confidence interval is way more informed because it give you a

480
01:03:38,010 --> 01:03:43,650
range of values that are possible and that might be compatible with the parameter.

481
01:03:45,190 --> 01:03:54,020
And it includes also the magnitude. And obviously this election season, a very interesting illustration of of of that.

482
01:03:54,050 --> 01:03:58,100
And it's from a simulation study, a study in Silico.

483
01:03:59,210 --> 01:04:04,370
So some investigators set a parameter of interest, you know, could be a.

484
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:08,840
And not racial or racial difference, whatever.

485
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:13,880
And that's represented by this vertical line is a parameter.

486
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:19,820
So it's fixed. And then they simulated conducting one study 100 times.

487
01:04:20,570 --> 01:04:28,400
And every time they conducted this study, they recorded the value of the point estimate and the value of the confidence interval.

488
01:04:28,430 --> 01:04:34,120
So in this figure, what you have is, again, the vertical line is the parameter,

489
01:04:34,820 --> 01:04:42,770
and each horizontal line represents each study that was simulated to try to estimate that parameter.

490
01:04:43,460 --> 01:04:53,570
That little vertical bar you see the point estimate and the width of the line represents the width of the confidence interval.

491
01:04:55,210 --> 01:05:01,720
So in 95% confidence interval should cover the parameter.

492
01:05:02,870 --> 01:05:12,199
95% of the times, which means if you conduct this study 100 times in 95% of those studies,

493
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:18,200
in 95 of those studies, you should hit the parameter with your confidence interval.

494
01:05:19,460 --> 01:05:28,360
Do you think that that was true? Look here, they have sorted the values of each study by their size.

495
01:05:29,630 --> 01:05:40,340
And. The first two and the last three do not go over the parameter of interest, but all the other 95 do.

496
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:51,660
So I hope that this dramatic visualization will sort of help you recall the interpretation of the confidence.

497
01:05:53,010 --> 01:06:01,070
Is there confidence, the level of confidence that. That interval covers the parameter of interest.

498
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:06,420
Very cool. Um.

499
01:06:08,230 --> 01:06:14,620
Now when the confidence interval for a measure of association does not cover.

500
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:23,480
The. Expected value under the null meaning expected value under no association.

501
01:06:24,290 --> 01:06:29,630
It is possible to use the confidence interval to declare statistical significance.

502
01:06:30,260 --> 01:06:38,570
So if the confidence interval does not go over one for a ratio, you can see that the cumulative expense ratio is statistically significant.

503
01:06:38,650 --> 01:06:42,950
It would be equivalent to a p value of less than .05.

504
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:48,030
But again, the confidence, the integrity is way more important.

505
01:06:49,290 --> 01:06:54,650
What will be the confidence interval for the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in Juneau, Alaska?

506
01:06:55,670 --> 01:07:02,240
So we plug in those numbers. They estimate the investigator gold was point 4%.

507
01:07:02,510 --> 01:07:10,249
I mean, 4% or 2% going for plus or minus the Z value is this statistic for the 95%

508
01:07:10,250 --> 01:07:16,880
level of confidence you are going to and multiplied by the variance of of P,

509
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:21,530
which is B times one minus three divided by the sample size.

510
01:07:23,210 --> 01:07:31,550
And the confidence interval that is obtained is point 34, 2.46.

511
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:38,719
So with 95% confidence, the true parameter should be between those numbers.

512
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:45,480
The two parameter, meaning the actual. Prevalence of vitamin deficiency in general.

513
01:07:50,380 --> 01:07:57,420
And because the confidence interval does not really overlap with the U.S. prevalence of vitamin D, you remember what was deficient.

514
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:03,520
What was that? 28. So 28 is outside this range.

515
01:08:04,690 --> 01:08:13,350
Because of that, you can say that. The difference between this number and 28 is statistically significant.

516
01:08:18,020 --> 01:08:23,210
But does the confidence interval tell you the direction of the association?

517
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:31,660
In other words, whether they. Whether the value in Juneau is likely to be higher or lower than the value in the US.

518
01:08:33,650 --> 01:08:40,160
Commissioner Rachel. What's the value in the US?

519
01:08:41,590 --> 01:08:46,300
Going 28. Right. And was the lowest bound of the confidence interval.

520
01:08:47,210 --> 01:08:53,720
Point 24. So can you anticipate whether in Juneau the prevalence is higher or lower than in the US?

521
01:08:54,710 --> 01:08:57,830
Yeah, is higher. So it is giving you that information.

522
01:08:59,280 --> 01:09:03,240
Right. Right.

523
01:09:07,710 --> 01:09:12,720
Now there is also a relation of the confidence interval with the power of a study which is,

524
01:09:12,930 --> 01:09:19,409
as we said, that probability of a detecting and association.

525
01:09:19,410 --> 01:09:28,590
And there are a number of assumptions. So the larger the sample size with the confidence interval be narrower or wide.

526
01:09:29,970 --> 01:09:34,030
Narrow, narrow, because you would have more confidence there.

527
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:42,720
The distance to the parameter will be smaller, so the parameter will be contained within a smaller range of values you get.

528
01:09:43,140 --> 01:09:46,140
In other words, you are getting close to the super population.

529
01:09:47,180 --> 01:09:54,500
GHOSN Right. Whereas when you sample size is small, you have much less confidence.

530
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:59,540
You estimate is less precise.

531
01:10:01,190 --> 01:10:09,250
This presents, the possible value of the parameter might be within a larger range of numbers.

532
01:10:09,820 --> 01:10:13,600
So obviously you have less confidence this position.

533
01:10:18,770 --> 01:10:23,890
And most importantly. A key prerequisite for any of these.

534
01:10:25,890 --> 01:10:32,250
For hypothesis testing or statistical estimation is first guarantee the internal validity of the study.

535
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:38,910
In other words, again, ad nauseum. You have to be immunologist before statistics.

536
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:44,300
Because this is what. This is what we do as epidemiologists.

537
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:54,030
You know, we need to guarantee there is no measurement error. There is no and reasonable control confounding, reasonable selection bias statistics.

538
01:10:54,300 --> 01:11:05,400
You know, there's so many power in so many packages now, you can just guarantee at your fingertips that this these one is this is this is difficult.

539
01:11:05,580 --> 01:11:09,760
Right? It is why you are here. I hope.

540
01:11:09,770 --> 01:11:15,920
I mean, people have different motivations, but. All right.

541
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:26,750
Any questions? Okay.

542
01:11:28,450 --> 01:11:33,250
This is your progress report. You should be able to differentiate identification from estimation.

543
01:11:35,230 --> 01:11:39,660
Recall identification means when there is. No bias.

544
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:45,110
You should be able to estimate a causal effect and divisors of random variability in

545
01:11:45,110 --> 01:11:51,610
randomized and observational studies defined random variability using notation differentially.

546
01:11:51,620 --> 01:11:54,920
So that means that the distance between each attempt and the center.

547
01:11:57,080 --> 01:12:06,230
Differentiate hypothesis testing and statistical estimation defense that is to quantify recognize the general form of a test statistic.

548
01:12:06,890 --> 01:12:13,550
Interpret the P-value correctly, remember the song name the limitations of hypothesis testing.

549
01:12:14,210 --> 01:12:18,120
Recognize the general form of a confidence interval interpret.

550
01:12:19,270 --> 01:12:28,900
But the main interpretation of the confusing interrogations should. Yeah.

551
01:12:30,070 --> 01:12:35,600
Many of the British, confusingly. Confidence that it covers.

552
01:12:36,710 --> 01:12:43,110
That. Around the clock.

553
01:12:44,070 --> 01:12:47,580
I named the strength of the confidence interval over hypothesis estimation.

554
01:12:48,530 --> 01:12:56,210
It gives you that confidence of where the parameter is. It also gives you a sense of the magnitude and the duration of the association.

555
01:12:58,100 --> 01:13:01,400
All right. So I'll see you Monday.

556
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:08,990
That would be my last lecture, and I will post an announcement of what's happening thereafter.

557
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:18,940
Don't be alarmed. Nothing really serious happens. Like I'm dying or quitting or anything.

558
01:13:20,530 --> 01:13:24,100
But. Yeah. So I'll see you. I'll see you Monday and enjoy the weekend.

559
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:42,710
Yeah. Asking questions?

560
01:13:43,470 --> 01:13:50,160
Sure. Would they be more excited because they're so disappointed when they pick up my stuff here?

561
01:13:51,930 --> 01:13:56,050
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

562
01:13:57,960 --> 01:14:03,680
Well, whatever. Your question is okay.

563
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:21,230
Well, no, it's said.

564
01:14:32,190 --> 01:14:48,190
I appreciate. You know, it's the Blue Mountains here that is really going to.

565
01:14:58,250 --> 01:15:07,020
Right out. That's how I hear a lot of those 20.

566
01:15:14,420 --> 01:15:20,780
You might not. Since our clients.

567
01:15:24,590 --> 01:15:28,510
I do agree. Everything else is the same here.

568
01:15:29,690 --> 01:15:41,640
I just by the time I had my little sister, I got out tonight.

569
01:15:48,870 --> 01:15:59,950
I heard. Yeah, I want to.

570
01:16:03,680 --> 01:16:19,270
Lot. I.

571
01:16:24,350 --> 01:16:29,570
It was literally whatever you I only.

572
01:16:30,850 --> 01:16:38,710
Yes, I know, I know.

573
01:16:43,550 --> 01:16:49,570
In. Also.

574
01:16:53,680 --> 01:17:02,950
A lot of. You. The only thing.

575
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:16,020
And I was. Over the.

576
01:17:21,940 --> 01:17:27,390
Just find out what it was.

577
01:17:27,480 --> 01:17:37,550
You really started. Obama did not appear to be able to.

578
01:17:43,210 --> 01:17:50,670
Wait. Did you? Yeah, you're right.

579
01:17:57,280 --> 01:18:01,260
But I don't think it. You want me to make you forget the.

580
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:12,760
Yeah. There's no probability. And it's like.

581
01:18:16,470 --> 01:18:32,580
I'm so glad I get to. And why not?

582
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:36,960
Well, that's not the. No. Here.

583
01:18:41,180 --> 01:19:07,760
I don't really reality. Have you.
