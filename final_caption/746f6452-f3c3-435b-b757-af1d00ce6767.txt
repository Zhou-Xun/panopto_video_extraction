1
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:07,160
Okay. Good morning. Good morning.

2
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:18,700
Good morning. They look zoomed in or it's fine.

3
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:21,690
It's not okay.

4
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:41,320
So last time we worked on the practice problem stands for language analysis and we kind of like I know for the last part, you just quickly go over it.

5
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:48,550
What about were there any questions that this problem sets?

6
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:52,720
I think there's some didn't post it there.

7
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:59,890
Yeah, this is more like a general question, but I need to if you're like nevertheless bring it on the blog.

8
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:05,350
Oh, yeah, that's a good question. Okay. So I was going to actually add that.

9
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:18,400
So option one is to do the calculations we have an option to is that you can combine number of children here on the table.

10
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:29,710
So so let's say you're looking at five children for five non recombinant zero recombinant.

11
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:33,100
That would be a life score of 1.55.

12
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:45,160
And if you let's say you don't have that, then you can combine the four here, the 1.2 of the one and then the the one.

13
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:50,580
Yeah. Is that you can do it either way.

14
00:01:50,590 --> 00:02:02,139
Like let's say you have we're looking at the swans and three and ah you can you combine like from the three you and the two or three.

15
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:05,890
The two and three. Is that clear.

16
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:11,649
So if you have a number of offspring with, let's say more than seven and you don't have that,

17
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:17,890
let's say have eight, then you can combine that with the number of children here.

18
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:28,870
Yeah. The question. Okay.

19
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:39,450
So last thing we talked about last time was we did calculate the loan score based on one individual therapy.

20
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:47,550
And then this is this is like a really important piece, is that when we're looking to combine information across categories,

21
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:53,190
then we had the lowest scores at the same level of data.

22
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,130
Okay. So I'd say use of security, how to reduce pretty one too.

23
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:14,250
You would add this column here, remember, do not add a lot scores the first thing technically and then in this case here.

24
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:25,009
It's not significant.

25
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:32,450
If you have for some of the law more than two, more than three, then that's when you would have the evidence of linkage.

26
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:38,300
Then you would report the maximum blood score and then what kind of value it occurs.

27
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:47,309
This in both this case and both these examples was not significant.

28
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:59,220
But let's that point to you had this some flawed ads for then that would indicate that you do have evidence of linkage at theta 0.2.

29
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:11,910
So that means that you have marker of your marker and your genetic loci are at or at point to date of recombination or 2070 Morgans.

30
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:22,890
This tends between each other. And you would support the large score of this at this theta which would be the greater than three.

31
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,040
Is that clear. Have seems that.

32
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:38,210
Oh okay so who I think I don't know how many of you started the problems that so they will have we've

33
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:45,060
tried to leave plenty of time today for you to work on that because that's to Thursday before class.

34
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:54,120
So we'll try to work on that three today and I'll tell them step two was corrected and handed back to you.

35
00:04:55,530 --> 00:05:01,859
Yeah, because I have to create a different problem then it's a different submission,

36
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:17,310
but I believe that place for published and then so the exam would be exam one would be open for access on Thursday after class.

37
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:26,520
You have a week to complete that it's it's a six questions and you would work on that like similar ten assignments

38
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:35,190
and that's how you work on time but not in groups so individually so if you go on assignment it should open up.

39
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:41,430
It should open up here. Exactly.

40
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:45,720
Okay. So it's just. Just like how you worked an assignment.

41
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:53,280
So open up. There's the time. Once you download it, you have a week to finish.

42
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:57,160
You have access to all material that's kind of an open exam.

43
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:02,720
Okay. If you have questions, just be sure to email me.

44
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:09,469
Do not discuss it with each other. So I think I'm going to be like a dog, like the problem sets that we download.

45
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:15,920
Or is it like on canvas? You know, it's a problem set. Like it's a word that you just deal.

46
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:28,870
And the question. Oh.

47
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:39,870
And then if you can type, I think that would make it easier for the reader if you really have to like just write really neatly and upload a picture.

48
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:48,569
Okay. So I think we will leave thinking this equilibrium too for for Thursday we'll do the

49
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:55,200
whole picture that was part of the readings for this for linkage to equilibrium.

50
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:03,270
We'll talk briefly about it and then give you time for problem set three.

51
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,720
Is that some good? Okay.

52
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:20,880
So home paper to be. If you want to pull it up for me, we will go over some of the questions now, some for.

53
00:07:56,530 --> 00:08:05,760
Well. Okay.

54
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:17,170
Okay. So this is an example of.

55
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:33,740
So this is an example of sort of an old study that was done to identify genetic loci that was associated with familial breast cancer.

56
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:41,630
So this is back from the 1990, I believe, and.

57
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:53,560
So the paper recruited 23 extended families that were really enriched for cases of breast cancer.

58
00:08:53,770 --> 00:09:04,150
And they showed the pedigrees, as you can see, of lots of the affected individuals in each of these pedigrees stated in black.

59
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:06,489
And the goal,

60
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:18,760
overall goal of the paper is to identify which genetic loci is kind of moving with the family within this family and associated with breast cancer.

61
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:25,420
So those are some of the questions. So I kind of answered the first one.

62
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:36,190
What is the purpose of performing this linkage analysis? So why do you think breast cancer was a good candidate for linkage analysis,

63
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:43,300
or why did the author think that breast cancer, which candidate for this type of study?

64
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:59,360
This family history of the disease was a significant risk factor for developing.

65
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:10,219
And yeah, so it is it looks like it has a good genetic component that is being inherited and is more prevalent in fact,

66
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:14,960
in families like when you once you have a family member effective than you would have,

67
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:22,340
you're more likely to have a sister or a mother or a close relative being affected.

68
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:33,030
So another question is why has the mapping of genes for breast cancer been so complicated and complicated before?

69
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:52,170
But. It's like really common, but only a small proportion of the cases like the inherited risk.

70
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:57,240
It's not completely penetrant. Yeah. So, so yeah.

71
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,220
Overall, there's like heterogeneity in breast cancer.

72
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:07,500
So, so, so both pensions and then they talk about.

73
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:15,700
That that it's heterogeneous. So it's not. So some cases might be genetic.

74
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:25,239
Some cases might not be genetic. Some cases in families, they they have the inherited risk, but they do not show it yet.

75
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:29,500
So penetrance issues. Yeah.

76
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:35,500
So what are the characteristics of familial breast cancer?

77
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:50,640
You know, from that, it's really spelled out in the paper to look.

78
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:57,739
Younger age. Diagnosis frequent bi lateral disease and more frequent occurrence.

79
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:05,569
And yeah. So so that now we're making the kind of comparison between familiar familiar versus

80
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:09,980
sporadic and we'll we'll talk more about it once we were doing the cancer lecture.

81
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:21,260
Like, if you if you've heard of the double hip hypothesis where you invest in cancer cases,

82
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:30,170
you're likely to have inherited a malformed malfunctioning copy or like the risk from one parent, but then you have a good copy.

83
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,930
And so this your risk of breast cancer is increased.

84
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:41,870
It's or you you're likely more to develop breast cancer or cancer in general.

85
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:47,270
If that good copy that you inherited from your parent eventually mutates and you end up

86
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:54,590
with cancer being kind of expressed and that is more likely to happen at younger age.

87
00:12:55,640 --> 00:13:05,900
And then you would have more kind of in the it's not just random where you would have breast cancer in one one breast,

88
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:12,440
it's more frequent bilateral disease. And then since this it's not explained.

89
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:19,310
So then men are susceptible to it as well.

90
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:37,810
So. So the authors also talk about a previous study or previous work where they did some sort some form of pedigree analysis on 1500 families.

91
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,610
And then what were the findings from that study?

92
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:19,360
But the inherent susceptibilities could possibly be explained by a rare autosomal dominant

93
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,280
polio that greatly impacted the risk that that person had for developing cancer.

94
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:32,620
Yeah. Yeah, exactly. So based on the like the pedigree analysis that they did, a segregation analysis,

95
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:40,090
they could they thought that it is like they're looking for a rare autism, low dominant LDL.

96
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:46,110
And then we. So.

97
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:53,810
So 11. they emphasize is how they define a best seller.

98
00:14:54,590 --> 00:15:00,590
And why? Why do you think that's important? Like the definition of breast cancer in this case.

99
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:09,650
So whenever you're doing a study which is important to have a good definition of your outcome and.

100
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:19,560
Phenotype of interest. Or at least how did they do?

101
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:41,050
How did they identify cases of breast cancer? Yeah.

102
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:52,090
I think they said that she relied on self-reporting of breast cancer if they had an undergone surgery.

103
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:58,750
And they said it's important to define it because real linkages could be missed.

104
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:05,590
Or you could think of linkages that don't exist because, you know, definable.

105
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:16,000
Yeah. So they so they employ interviews with with family members or self-reported.

106
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,970
And they also looked at records, surgery records.

107
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:30,009
Just because reporting might not be the best indicator like you could have and do like reporting,

108
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:37,180
but I don't know, like you could ask a member and then they would say, I'm cancer or something.

109
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:39,100
Like it could not be a very specific.

110
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:50,950
So they did kind of both think that hospital records that certificate in addition to self-reported breast cancer.

111
00:16:51,880 --> 00:17:00,550
And then it's important to have a good definition that is not too broad where you're capturing not just breast cancer,

112
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:10,330
capturing more than or different types of cancer and then not too narrow that you're missing out and missing out on breast cancer cases.

113
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:19,540
Um, so and this study, so they must look over it a little bit together.

114
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:25,670
So they. So they talk about the markers.

115
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:36,170
Remember how we said that when you're doing linkage analysis, then you have certain set of markers that you know of their location.

116
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:43,150
So here that they looked at these markers at this genomically genetic region on chromosome 17.

117
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,520
So these were tandem repeats.

118
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:58,190
And they have their names. And then the table here is similar to what we kind of did in the practice problem set.

119
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:08,930
So this is showing the the lot scores for linkage of breast cancer to one one marker.

120
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:13,160
This is this is the d17 74.

121
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:17,270
And then they reported it for each family.

122
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:24,890
And they examined a number of things or recombination, fractured fractions.

123
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:32,290
So if you. If you if we just go back and look at the table.

124
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:35,740
So whether we're looking at a theta of zero,

125
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:46,360
so that means you're assuming that your marker and your susceptibility loci or the disease loci are really, really close together.

126
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:50,350
So there is zero. So basically there's no recombination happening.

127
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:59,110
So the closest they are to each other and if you can look across like each of these scenarios,

128
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:09,100
you see that the maximum theta, the maximum blood score would be at this value at zero zero of theta.

129
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:14,920
But when you were doing the calculations, that might be hard to calculate, like a data zero zero.

130
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:21,180
So we usually kind of test for a .01, which is what they did in the paper.

131
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:28,600
Mm hmm. So this is like the this is assuming a scenario where they are really,

132
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:37,540
really close to each other and then they tested the different recombination fractions .1. to .3.4.

133
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:43,570
And then they have also another component here which is important to kind of

134
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:50,800
consider is m which is the mean age of diagnosis of breast cancer per family.

135
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:56,710
So for family one, the mean age of diagnosis for breast cancer was 32.

136
00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:04,510
So it's pretty young and the values here are sorted by M so so the families are

137
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:12,340
sorted by early diagnosis mean age of diagnosis towards older age of diagnosis.

138
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:19,360
And then you see who has a lot scores for each recombination fraction.

139
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:30,520
Remember when we're looking at evidence, then we would sum the lots scores across families for each data.

140
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:40,840
So the last column here is sort of a cumulative log score at this theta 0.01.

141
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:48,730
Okay, so you have the 2.36 adding the .5.4.1 for.

142
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:55,040
Adding across all the families. Is that clear?

143
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:16,430
Any questions on that? Then looking at the the the lot scores here, what do you think would be the interpretation?

144
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:25,710
So remember, the goal is to look whether this marker here is associated with breast cancer.

145
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:31,820
And this this set of pedigrees here. So what do you think?

146
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:40,880
What's the conclusion? What is the what what value are we looking for?

147
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:53,550
For evidence of linkage? Yeah.

148
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:57,100
I've been doing the .001. Yeah.

149
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:02,170
Yes. Yes. We're looking at this column here. Oh one.

150
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:07,480
And then a significant log score would be greater than three.

151
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:12,400
So as you can see in those families like to say the top.

152
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:16,830
Maybe the first 13 or 14 families.

153
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,910
We do have evidence of linkage.

154
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:27,150
So this marker here is associated with breast cancer in those families.

155
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:35,730
And then as you add more families, then you're kind of losing this evidence and you have evidence against linkage.

156
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:44,950
And then if we try to think, what's the difference between those top families up here and then those those in the bottom?

157
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:50,409
What do you what's the main difference? H h yeah.

158
00:22:50,410 --> 00:23:00,430
So we have certain families where age of diagnosis is younger and in those families then this marker

159
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:09,309
is associated with breast cancer versus we have a set of families where they do have breast cancer,

160
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:12,790
but it's not related to this specific genetic marker.

161
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:18,639
And then this this genomic region is actually the brackla one.

162
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:29,020
So now we know that. So the risk of breast cancer in some families could be related to that, but not all families.

163
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:33,400
So so this kind of table shows that there is.

164
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:39,829
Hydrogen heterogeneity in breast cancer. So this marker might be associated,

165
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:46,440
but there's in other families there could be evidence of other genomic close by associated

166
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:52,790
with with with the with breast cancer or environmental effects or something else going on.

167
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,500
But it's not related to this marker. Is that clear?

168
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:06,970
Okay. Um, this is the most important thing to get out of this paper.

169
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:13,659
Anyone have anything else to talk about for this paper, or should we just leave it?

170
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:18,820
Time to work on process right now. Okay.

171
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:27,650
So. So let's go ahead and get started working on problem set three.

172
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:38,690
Let me know if you have any concerns. The paparazzi said to me, I feel like the first question is pretty straightforward.

173
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:47,690
The second one is a little confused. But I can give you hints as as you get, as you like, start working on it.

174
00:24:58,379 --> 00:25:04,259
I would love it if you could travel. I think most of your questions you were asking a about.

175
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:12,429
Yes, you too. So so the question is asking about genes.

176
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:28,559
Capital A, B, C and D. And then we're asked to tell the order of the of those genes and how of those genes and how they're located on the chromosome.

177
00:25:29,099 --> 00:25:40,469
So a small tip is that looking at both parents, we can see that they are heterozygous at each of those genes.

178
00:25:40,979 --> 00:25:44,428
So in the examples we did in the problems that we had,

179
00:25:44,429 --> 00:25:55,168
one parent that was parent was homozygous homozygous at one of those genetic locations but heterozygous in the others.

180
00:25:55,169 --> 00:26:01,979
So in this case, be mindful of what's the number of informative minuses that can happen because any time

181
00:26:01,979 --> 00:26:07,829
you have recombination while the gametes are produced in the father or in the mother,

182
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:17,249
we're able to tell if recombination happened. So it's not what we had before for the number of informative meiosis.

183
00:26:19,739 --> 00:26:32,908
And then we would just go through and look at the offspring and see when we had a mix between capital letters, genes and small letter genes.

184
00:26:32,909 --> 00:26:46,619
And like for example, a tip is that if we're looking at this person here this to to then if I'm looking if B combination happened between A and C,

185
00:26:46,619 --> 00:26:51,539
I would count it because I have a mix between the capital and the small, small letter.

186
00:26:51,539 --> 00:27:00,659
C It can be recombination between the C and the D and it can be a complete combination, I guess, between the B and the D.

187
00:27:01,529 --> 00:27:04,829
So we do not know the order. The question is asking about the order.

188
00:27:04,979 --> 00:27:10,498
So we're going to calculate the recombination fraction between all those different possibilities.

189
00:27:10,499 --> 00:27:20,069
Like did recombination happen between the and the B, B and C, C and D between B and C and then between B indeed.

190
00:27:21,899 --> 00:27:26,879
And then you get theta values, which are a measure of distance.

191
00:27:27,539 --> 00:27:34,379
And if if I know A and B are they have the largest theta, then I know they are the furthest apart.

192
00:27:35,809 --> 00:27:42,409
Right. Does that help? Many questions still confused.

193
00:27:47,629 --> 00:27:52,189
Okay. Well, let me know if you have questions and you're still have. I.
