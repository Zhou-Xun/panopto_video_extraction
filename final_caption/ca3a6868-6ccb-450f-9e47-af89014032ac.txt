1
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:08,240
Yeah. Right, right.

2
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:15,440
Sorry. You're trying to avoid from your grades.

3
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:19,400
I hope you had a good look. Right now, we're.

4
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:35,880
We're starting our second session, as I mentioned above, and I'm excited about the first session.

5
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,560
Yeah. Okay, good. Come back.

6
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:54,600
Yeah. Following our discussion of epidemiological transition now, I want to use some example to show, you know, what's in today's work.

7
00:00:55,050 --> 00:01:03,390
That's a. Have contributed to our understanding of epidemiological transition.

8
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:05,730
In the previous version,

9
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:19,530
we reviewed discussed the the classic scenario and the model for epidemiological transitions and to apply different series of models.

10
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,770
The epidemiological transition.

11
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:38,130
So where you find the true difference of things to one important decision is to understand some of the phases that all AIDS,

12
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:49,890
all states described in those six year and a model actually overlapping, especially in two day words.

13
00:01:50,400 --> 00:02:00,510
We have seen which sort. The transition has pretty much is complete in developed countries.

14
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:08,010
At one point. But doesn't the COVID 19 pandemic have slowed?

15
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:14,380
You know, I learned the word the Google health community.

16
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:21,220
That's we in self completing having completed the translation.

17
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:24,700
The translation became more complex.

18
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:39,460
So how we could gain a better understanding where we are in the difference of states, epidemiological transitions in the US or in other.

19
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,090
Developed countries or other developing countries.

20
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:47,840
So what kind of a study could you inform?

21
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:59,860
Inform us of the actual staged or potentially over an actual stages of the work is in

22
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:08,800
this is the global version of the DC studies I study stacks of crude to teach us.

23
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:14,050
Crude to inform us as to if.

24
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:26,060
Where we are in epidemiologic transition. So what I saw, as I mentioned, the early step for failing was specific details.

25
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:30,290
So from focusing on specific details of individual studies,

26
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:41,150
I want to provide you a history which is really relate to what we talked about at the end of the last session and.

27
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:56,350
So that to understand the use of this type of study and to then highlight some importance of lessons learned from early GPP studies, which is.

28
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,890
You know, something important, the basis of for today's continuous studies.

29
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:13,540
The most recent and most comprehensive one is the paper I uploaded for you and the next week's paper.

30
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:24,580
So when we're I will also introduce you to some of the tools for exploring the trends of projection.

31
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:33,890
GDP study the Cooper burden of the study.

32
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:38,330
Basically this is taking the approach that's a.

33
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:49,460
And deeper to measure disability and deaths from much killed causes work like it has to do.

34
00:04:49,490 --> 00:05:05,750
Over the past two decades, years into an international consortium for more than 1000, research researchers and estimates have been updated annually.

35
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:13,860
And I will introduce you. Already comprehensive one two.

36
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:23,510
Next week we will review some more recent one come up with and that is better understanding where

37
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:32,180
and the difference of where populations or countries or regions are in epidemiologic transition.

38
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:42,680
So the history could go back to the 1990s, which it was conducted at that time,

39
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:49,610
mainly by researchers at the Hover and the WTO as a single work bank commissioned.

40
00:05:49,610 --> 00:06:02,450
The study has the work thanks to the funding support sometimes to enhance some of the health intervention development efforts.

41
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:14,560
Like I was once involved in a work best known projects to develop one complete standards based

42
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:25,670
laboratory produce and TB vaccines so that they had quite a extensive for health statistics there too.

43
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:31,880
So that was initially conducted for that purpose.

44
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,339
So that's the earliest study.

45
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:45,050
It includes the quantification of the test effects of more than hundreds of diseases and injuries for only eight regions of the world.

46
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:51,739
And the estimates are for morbidity and mortality by age six.

47
00:06:51,740 --> 00:07:02,630
And the region was also in a study that introduced not just a desperate that's just thestory and what panic.

48
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:14,059
It's also introduce a fatality. And I'm sure by now you all know what's a fairly correct everyone is familiar with as a new metric

49
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:21,860
to quantify the burden of the diseases injuries and the risk factors to AIDS of comparison.

50
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:28,390
So this is an important metric for measuring a population health.

51
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:35,629
So not just the death rates of the panic group and it also has this things and does then that

52
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:44,580
was the the very early early earliest first global person disease study then in during.

53
00:07:46,280 --> 00:08:06,740
2022. And that's a picture of things after the early studies, that 1990 study, this was conducted by W.H.O., basically is this 2002 study.

54
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:12,590
It includes a more extensive analysis.

55
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:18,230
It used the framework comparative risk factor assessment.

56
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:22,310
So it's not just descriptive.

57
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:30,140
It's also includes some and an epidemiological investigation.

58
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:45,560
So positive risk factor for different populations, the risk factor that contributes to the disease burden pattern and to change a difference.

59
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:50,420
So this is the 2002 study.

60
00:08:51,020 --> 00:09:00,350
Then in 2004, further updates of EPD by public issue and in the Global Burden of Disease published in 2008.

61
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:11,210
Sure. And this study. Was poverty seen to some of it and then is also perplexing to some.

62
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:24,670
Nine. This covered more roads and regions of the world, covering 136 countries, disability and less state.

63
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:36,130
So that was how, you know, you can see this study evolved from limited the number of regions limit the number of.

64
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:41,100
Health disease, of course.

65
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:47,730
Too little for the coverage of the world's population.

66
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:51,840
And it's also a ball of money.

67
00:09:52,380 --> 00:10:05,250
And a descriptive epidemiologist talking about to also agree to exploring comparative risk factors for different countries, different population.

68
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:15,510
So then to sound and come back to answer a collaboration of several institutions.

69
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,800
So it's no longer 30. First time is the.

70
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:28,560
Harper and spiritual then spiritual took on the road to do the expanded study.

71
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:36,180
But in 2000 hence, this study became a more broad collaboration across several institutions,

72
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:41,670
including, of course, Steel Harbor and W.H.O., who did the study.

73
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:54,010
And then it's also. Include the Institute for Health Metrics at the University of Washington.

74
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:57,460
Actually, today, this study was really.

75
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:09,530
Based in University of Washington and leading the collaboration of course groups so.

76
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:13,899
They work the 2000 pen GP.

77
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:20,560
The study was published in Lancet in 2012.

78
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:34,090
It was funded by Gates Foundation. And what's involved, included in this study is, of course, officially study estimates updates since 2004.

79
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:41,350
So the quantification of the burden for poor countries, 91 major cause of death.

80
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,620
So this was much included to.

81
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:54,590
Much more. Disease conditions on the course of a test and a disability.

82
00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:05,210
And then it also includes the much more expensive a panel of risk factors disaggregated by 21 geographic regions.

83
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:09,710
20 age groups and 187 countries.

84
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:21,100
So you can see each case. My thought in terms of food disease coverage and more broadly in terms of chocolate regions,

85
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:29,940
population representations, and also more in depth because it has really.

86
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:43,780
More refined equipment for police to study it are also involving a community of nearly 500 experts at that time.

87
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:50,350
Now more than 2000 researchers involved in this complex health study.

88
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:57,980
So yeah, it's multidisciplinary or relevant to it.

89
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:04,360
Hyper epidemiologist the emphasis that is of course also health economics.

90
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:11,470
Because when you include such a wide panel of risk factors,

91
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:23,920
that's not just the epidemiologists and to you includes we know we just discussed earlier what contributes to epidemiologic translation.

92
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:33,700
You mentioned the many different medical interventions, public interventions and the nutrition and condition.

93
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:42,550
All of these require different expertise. So it's become a multidisciplinary global network.

94
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:55,600
And by that time, then 2013, it's another important study by Rachel with the Institute for Health Metrics.

95
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:02,730
Coordinates published in Germany 2014.

96
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:19,650
So these are all the earliest studies. So you could look at what's really new in this 2013 study is smoking, prevalence and sicker consumption.

97
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:32,730
188 countries during 1984 2012 or incorporates in the investigation.

98
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:39,300
So you can see that it's expended in the.

99
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:49,990
Interested in the health problems of smoke and TB,

100
00:14:49,990 --> 00:15:04,370
the 2015 coordinator at the Institute of Health Metrics in Washington and published in 2016 inches CVD 2016.

101
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:12,640
That's the course of this collaboration, which is published in The Lancet in some seven years.

102
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:24,890
I don't think I really need to talk about these, since I'm sure many of you have full heads of public health costs where you have a different issue.

103
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:31,610
So this paper represents the 2016 study.

104
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:36,710
It was one of the comprehensive one that.

105
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:42,640
Happens to the proud to the very last one that I'm going to introduce,

106
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:48,710
because this is the first time that's an event and lots of the important lessons.

107
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:55,160
Of course, the lessons have been expanded in the more recent years.

108
00:15:55,490 --> 00:16:06,320
If you go to pop up, you will find many more recent studies, as Wikipedia also reports a focus on individual countries,

109
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:12,770
for example, cardiovascular disease or degeneration with disease or maternal health.

110
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:21,380
And so it has more specific disease condition related studies.

111
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:27,380
However, it was one published in 2020 that.

112
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:35,210
Includes the time frame to some 90, which is the paper we work is customer reviews.

113
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:40,760
To do that assignment, I will have more information before the cut.

114
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:47,989
So this is the paper that's really looking to page six specific.

115
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:48,200
Specifically,

116
00:16:48,950 --> 00:17:05,750
what can it be for 264 courses of death from 1982 to some 68 represents the first systematic analyst for the Global Burden of Disease Study,

117
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:12,890
one of the most comprehensive one prior to the last one published in 2010.

118
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:21,320
And for this study is the importance of lessons learned about these studies.

119
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,620
The focus of this study that includes the quantity of available data.

120
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:37,370
As I discussed the earlier and also our other other costs and the quantity of available data.

121
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:47,620
It's really a major concern for many global health study and for infectious disease.

122
00:17:47,630 --> 00:18:04,310
For those of you interested in infectious disease and to many face a lack of capacity for accurate diagnosis or surveillance of the disease.

123
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:17,390
So then it also focuses more on tests from NCD because in a way we are especially in many.

124
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:30,140
Developed countries. This plays a major role in the population health and for developing countries that used to be predominant,

125
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:37,370
infectious diseases also saw an increase, dramatically increase in safety.

126
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:42,710
So for this study, that's from and the CDC was focused.

127
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:49,729
Then it also focused on the three leading cause of this in tourism and the five

128
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:58,730
which were and I'm sure you have some data then and others in this age shift.

129
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:13,160
We saw some the figures in our last session talking about the change of population growth.

130
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:20,010
And so we saw different age structure for different populations.

131
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:29,390
So this should become an important focus of a global burden of disease study.

132
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:38,930
And then there also in this study, ten leading causes by race of age is standardize the.

133
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:50,030
And why else you. Okay.

134
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:58,790
So what's the fund's about? Available data from Texas studies and varies by location.

135
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:13,160
This is why when we try to evaluate the intervention, the effectiveness of intervention, we have to have more.

136
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:26,810
The first question we want to ask is, do we have one data right from these studies, a find to which the five star quantity.

137
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:37,010
25 countries and four full 40 and almost a half of them, and over half of them are okay.

138
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:49,930
But you can also see this is a large number of I would ask the fact this is a country because actually less than half have quantity,

139
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:55,430
greater good quality significance.

140
00:20:55,430 --> 00:21:02,010
A longer proportion of countries has only one stop being poor.

141
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:14,210
And then there are also many countries totally a total lack vitality registration or Berber states

142
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:23,780
make it impossible to know so and the the ones in this study data finds that it's improved over time.

143
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:39,080
This is just a graph to show the data according to the use of these what's called the percent of garbage you call coded to death.

144
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:48,740
So it's basically showing your different color code, show you the different quantity you could see.

145
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:56,560
When you see all black, that means you don't really see much with the old black sessions.

146
00:21:56,570 --> 00:22:03,800
No data, just the you don't have to really say what's in each code.

147
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:11,150
You could see by color looking at the pattern, a huge variation across countries.

148
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:24,440
So this is one then, because the case with this study also showed that the classification for National Time series of matches,

149
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:30,379
registration and the normal autopsy data during the study period,

150
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:45,740
which ran from 1980 to 2016 and the basis for the fraction of deaths was certified and assigned to a detailed DVD.

151
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:57,410
You could see here that the poor quality where you had for high quality data and where you like the data.

152
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:03,860
So once the Southeast Asian country, definitely that is.

153
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:10,690
Not to reduce their head to what they're actually considering.

154
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:25,509
I have worse the data collection. If you look at this whole area, we had between 0 to 2, this poor area that's a is the largest,

155
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:32,290
the third and disproportionately affected by many important infectious diseases,

156
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:43,270
including the sweet sweet mother of choosing the think that's a look at the data and then this a blue color of course it's

157
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:59,300
the best the data collection for a school to observe that then between you know it's easier for you can see some country

158
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:09,520
incidentally but what's really concerning is that all these areas that how is the largest the burden of disease also happens

159
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:22,150
then and increase food insecurity increase chronic diseases and while terror the largest the burden of infectious disease.

160
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:27,520
This is where we need to better research, better epidemiological studies.

161
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:40,400
There is no data. So for any of you who are interested in infectious diseases, diseases or any diseases surveillance programs,

162
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:46,510
if you go the data first sent, do you even you are going to do immunization?

163
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:50,780
You have to do that. And a question about.

164
00:24:51,040 --> 00:25:01,780
So the first thing is data. I think sometimes we focus so much on study outcome, we question so little about data collection.

165
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:08,530
I think for anyone who are interested in global health, public health,

166
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:20,110
no matter your interest in disease control or environment control or any any research, the first question is to ask how that data is collected.

167
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:24,830
Other states are really representative of families.

168
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:32,900
And so before you get these questions answered, you don't want to spend so much time trying to interpret.

169
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:39,800
Right? You want to know to what extent you can interpret data, I suppose.

170
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,000
So these are important lessons from this study.

171
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:48,860
And this was not to assess the impact of the study, but of this study.

172
00:25:49,460 --> 00:26:00,630
Data quality was the first focus. First off, the multiple focus of this study.

173
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:12,850
Then, of course, with a comprehensive study like these, they also generate some major findings regarding the causes of death for these.

174
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:22,890
And these are more specific, but I guess to provide some data so that you you get some idea this could be our faces when you do your.

175
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:36,410
Assignment. When we talk about the 2020 poverty study, including the time frame until 2019, you could contrast the findings.

176
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:50,180
So in these two studies, the course of assessing who's on something and see the worst one or in the study population, it's this account for 70.

177
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:54,460
The. 2.3%.

178
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:57,940
So that was a major cause.

179
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:12,190
The. He sees them communicate for maternal health to come to 19%.

180
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:17,410
Then another important thing is not just looking at the.

181
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:29,680
That's right. They're also looking at the trend. And this study shows that decreasing age standards in rates of obsessive and seeking

182
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:37,240
work and increasing total numbers of deaths from non-communicable diseases.

183
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:44,430
A decrease in both numbers and age of center.

184
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:50,860
That's from, you know, communicable diseases and domestic violence.

185
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:59,079
A disease and a decreasing age is standard this rate of deaths from injuries

186
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:04,300
but the varied the total number of injuries result of deaths across region.

187
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:19,020
One of the things you could do is to compare the major cause of death your assignment between this study and the most recent one.

188
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:30,889
That's what we do. And then also try to highlight some disparity in the translation, if you could,

189
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:37,540
to come up with, for example, some comparative to charts using some of the data of poverty.

190
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:52,060
There now would be interesting, since it's also led to the discovery of flu three global leading cause of deaths in children under five.

191
00:28:52,810 --> 00:29:04,840
Basically this includes the lower respiratory infections and neonatal the pre term there's complications because you

192
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:17,649
know like the preterm birth was also one of the focus and the the complications and the rates and the substance.

193
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:24,380
So hence the due to birth asphyxia and head trauma disorder.

194
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:30,640
Three leading. Courses the best maturity on the side.

195
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:38,200
Another thing is very interesting is age is shift in sex.

196
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:48,040
In 1992, 2006, in a profound shift towards this old age.

197
00:29:49,850 --> 00:30:03,770
And this is partly because, you know, the most the flu immunization program has really focused on younger age group.

198
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:12,980
And then the more people panic due to vaccine, preventable disease has been largely reduced.

199
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:21,110
And then, of course, things they mostly impact the eight older age groups.

200
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:30,950
Right. So you see a major age impact shift, a shift in deaths.

201
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:40,100
So this some of the. Statistics, which you don't have to memorize.

202
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:47,390
That's it's just to get some feel for the pattern, especially when you're through the new ones.

203
00:30:47,780 --> 00:31:01,460
And so you could kind of looking to someone, come on, come on and focus, and then see how doing that time of compare to the year has changed.

204
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:13,150
Yeah. This is some of the statistics that just give you a few numbers.

205
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:25,240
They also have for ages. When the top panel is now ages, stress rise to the lower panel, age stress.

206
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:35,480
This is a global conversation for younger tests, but never too caustic cause five different course as number one and number two.

207
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:47,530
And as you can see. This also, in a way, reflects some epidemiological transition in different patterns here.

208
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:51,730
If you look at the early on, what are the major?

209
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,400
Course a few things, right? That's true.

210
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:05,900
This is a close up of this year for infections and few HIV, TB diarrhea.

211
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:13,280
So just look at the Connor compensation trends.

212
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:24,050
You can appreciate that epidemiological transition has happened, you know, for different age groups.

213
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:31,580
You can see how 1990 compared to 2016.

214
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:41,690
You can see for some age groups, this transition seems to be more severe after age groups.

215
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:50,820
Nucleus and the leading drivers.

216
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:54,660
Three. Cause of the photos.

217
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:59,880
Oh, right. It's become free for all ages.

218
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:03,629
Females and males, as you can see.

219
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:17,580
Also huge. Here you can see some of the African countries, some some countries how that's really different from the common cold.

220
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:21,210
So every country's at a different stage.

221
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:26,950
And that's the country's issue characteristics.

222
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:34,790
The profile may have some significance. Yeah.

223
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:42,160
Then it was 2006 to 2016.

224
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:49,580
Some other major findings. The leading cause by race of age standards y.

225
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:54,320
L, l. And a significant decrease.

226
00:33:55,280 --> 00:34:07,610
That's the one major visual medium. Annualized changes, but a lower medium annualized rate of change for all of those causes.

227
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:18,260
Okay. So then globally, the top four leading causes of the total is in 2016, including the final.

228
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:28,840
You can see. They are both NCD and infectious diseases.

229
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:36,400
So they are not so, you know, showing one only one type of disease.

230
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:41,650
We had some cardiovascular disease and so one of the dating course,

231
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:52,060
but they are also many other infectious diseases and actually most of them are infectious diseases.

232
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:56,260
So this is why we currently.

233
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:59,890
We don't really have a.

234
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:14,830
So completing or close completing the transition from one type of APC to project nested, we see more links between the different types of pieces.

235
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:30,140
The Greeks are expected to love your apple. Wire from malaria and HIV aids across sub-Saharan Africa.

236
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:42,920
As I say, that's where we also have been have been because many diagnosis not available and or accurate diagnosis of tools are not available.

237
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:48,630
Then diabetes type two diabetes and so especially in ocean.

238
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:59,060
Some opportunities there then into personal violence with some lacking memory and that can be that this.

239
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:03,470
You can see for different populations by just looking at disease.

240
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:10,820
You can see how you know diverse is the pattern.

241
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:17,740
The less time expects to. Why overseas something you some other countries.

242
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:29,350
That's a it's again it's nothing like for the study population or population included in the study.

243
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:39,100
Sure. To the absence of pattern we hopefully we're at a next week with we're discussing both from the.

244
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:47,720
I don't think forward next week or two more.

245
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:55,490
To further understand the global epidemiological transition.

246
00:36:56,660 --> 00:37:04,160
The answer to the question and that is this transition is a divergence or convergence

247
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:13,850
and then probably highlights some of the major transition that has happened.

248
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:18,080
You get some populations in major populations.

249
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:31,159
So lots of these or interpreted interpretation from these studies over the past 37 years has shown that decline

250
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:42,130
rates will communicate more matrilineal nature and the nutrition of diseases across all parts of Asia.

251
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:49,670
I was fast as I expecting this for many locations and wrote to two.

252
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:54,220
There is a group of shifts towards deaths of old age.

253
00:37:55,070 --> 00:38:04,760
Such is success in and many course of early that's that's the date our vaccination program had contributed to that.

254
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:19,700
And another sign is the antiretroviral treatments have significantly expanded the life expectancy of HIV infected the population,

255
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:27,830
which was one of the major infectious diseases, so that then people live longer.

256
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:34,700
Of course you receive more older people this time.

257
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:44,570
Then why have we increased globally for causes such as diabetes or some neoplasm

258
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:51,890
and in some locations or causes such as drug use disorders and the conflict?

259
00:38:52,190 --> 00:39:00,080
And then the last the interpretation of the study findings increase.

260
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:07,970
The risk of bias might reflect the outcomes from conditions that require high levels of the kill,

261
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:18,650
but for which effective treatments for of potentially increase and of course through health systems.

262
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:30,490
Yes. So that's the study. And I think what's important is not to remember the specific details, the findings.

263
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:42,140
It's to see how this type of study is, what kind of outcomes these type of the study can lead to, what kind of knowledge we can learn.

264
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:50,410
It's more the methodology and rather the concept rather than specific group findings.

265
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:58,930
Because when you is studies where poverty leads to different study findings and you couldn't, you don't have to memorize that.

266
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:11,000
But so you just try to understand this type global burden disease, study what they can focus on, what they can answer, you know,

267
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:24,830
the interface for understanding better epidemiology of the different disease and to the dynamic of epidemiological translation.

268
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:30,470
I think of this more importance is that memorize those specific findings.

269
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:36,320
I'm just using those data to show you what this type of study can do.

270
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:40,020
Okay. So. Yeah.

271
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:43,180
That's I think I want to make sure. And then.

272
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:54,180
Why that's a study shows the importance, the role of food and safety.

273
00:40:55,290 --> 00:41:04,650
Four that contributes to the deaths of global population, the increase in CV deaths,

274
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:12,900
number of deaths, although the rate has been infectious, disease is not gone.

275
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:18,000
And this paper is very important to realize,

276
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:34,350
though we are not really seeing a clear transition in any part of the world after 2016 infectious diseases due to health and development.

277
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:48,209
So after to go to look at this paper and I'm sure with our most recent global health experience with COVID 19,

278
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:52,110
you would appreciate the meaning of the viewpoints of the US.

279
00:41:52,920 --> 00:42:01,410
And to then another importance of perspective to have or to be familiar with this

280
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:08,610
is the burden of non-communicable and infectious disease in developing countries.

281
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:17,760
So this represents a major challenge to global health and to global population growth,

282
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:30,120
because many infectious diseases have been present in many developing countries for a very long period of time,

283
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:37,080
but then in several countries to control having those disease control,

284
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:44,480
they are seeing increased chronic disease, some really related lifestyle triggers.

285
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:52,920
I was amazed by how much some of my visiting scholars from different countries and to

286
00:42:54,180 --> 00:43:02,470
governments like to drink some soda and to enjoy so much drinking though since the the,

287
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:07,560
of course, you know, contributing to some of chronic diseases.

288
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:21,900
Then here is a few websites and this is, you know, showing you some of the cause for study.

289
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:32,070
You can see, okay, so what this global is.

290
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:43,630
House burden study. They have really very substantial reporting for your age so you could explore and do the first tour.

291
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:59,380
One tourist, two or four house related to a speech and data visualization and to hear you could experience progress towards achieving the UN,

292
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:13,140
Sisson says. Then the broad development development goals in health equity over all will be applied to some 31 countries.

293
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:18,050
You could enter each country. I think you could explore that.

294
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:22,230
I'm just going to introduce this.

295
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:26,020
I actually didn't check this yesterday.

296
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:33,280
It may have more concrete. This was the slides or maybe last three years ago.

297
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:43,380
But you could go to look at, I'm sure to some 30 it has to 41 health related system people.

298
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:52,990
These are still indicators from the data covered from 1992 to 19.

299
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:57,960
So if you ever want to do some studies, use the available data.

300
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,810
This is a good place to look at them.

301
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:11,520
It's something you can use this tool also an example to ensure front directories for these indicators through to some surgeon.

302
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:18,480
Since you were working for different countries, health authorities, public health agencies.

303
00:45:18,790 --> 00:45:35,850
You could potentially interpret a number of things that people were reporting, making you feel as okay.

304
00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:44,019
So you could also look at two things and the over what else is related to SPG and DG

305
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:52,330
and if you think that's as well and or which is the case by country by global map.

306
00:45:52,660 --> 00:46:01,350
It's very, very cool though to try and compare the relationship between SPG indicates and

307
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:09,640
measures including HDI and the sharing and downloading figures for later use.

308
00:46:09,910 --> 00:46:14,580
So this is a very cool tool and another tour.

309
00:46:14,630 --> 00:46:18,340
It's called the TPP Result.

310
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:33,310
You can view this all kind of findings, results or GDP courses and risk etiologies, impairments, injuries by nature and the Syncrude aggregate.

311
00:46:34,030 --> 00:46:45,370
And then difference of measures and difference in matrix and age groups or six groups and locations.

312
00:46:45,730 --> 00:46:59,350
So it's very extensive results. And then the latest, of course, everyone's interests being very concerned about the COVID 19 epidemic.

313
00:46:59,830 --> 00:47:06,000
And so this also ongoing data inputs and aspects.

314
00:47:06,010 --> 00:47:20,680
So this is very good. And this to some extent they give you a lot of allow to the field lends a lot of importance of lessons and also,

315
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:36,580
you know, provide the direction for how to improve for Copel for these studies and then if you are interested in seeing.

316
00:47:37,650 --> 00:47:42,030
What's the broader range for the studies?

317
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:48,360
It's a TBD study network is doing.

318
00:47:48,720 --> 00:48:00,060
You could look at this nice. It's special issues, which includes many different publications, latest publications.

319
00:48:00,450 --> 00:48:11,010
Some are pieces specific. Some of them are actually characters, for example, women and some particular age groups.

320
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:27,900
So these suspicion issue covers many, most up to date global health data from 2019, with the latest analyzes focused on five key themes demographics,

321
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:36,870
diseases and injury, risk factors, population forecasting and universal health coverage.

322
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:45,710
So you got a person you can sink to when you study global persons disease.

323
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:50,010
So I encourage you to check out when you get a chance.

324
00:48:50,520 --> 00:49:04,319
And then, as I say, next week we will be doing this because with this in-class assignment, that's the in-class training course,

325
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:16,690
it's to give you more time, more time to interact with the media, with fellow students, and then you have some time to refine your study.

326
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:26,550
This way we can really and this gets a better picture of full epidemiological transition around the work.

327
00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:31,530
And also, Len, what's important is the house,

328
00:49:33,090 --> 00:49:44,340
the diversity that is across the group disparity and including both major leading

329
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:54,810
cause of deaths and also the most recent global health challenges of COVID 19.

330
00:49:55,140 --> 00:50:10,040
So we're having some really fun session while education hopefully I put this information here because we had a little issue with the papers.

331
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:14,010
The site haven't been able to do that.

332
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:20,190
And your questions. Of course, I mentioned of many different studies.

333
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:25,860
This is some of the major ones too, but not exhaustive.

334
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:32,940
When I say that, when I read it, I think of these researching different ways to record it.

335
00:50:33,570 --> 00:50:39,080
Now I am not going to stop until we stop the Christian questions.

336
00:50:41,970 --> 00:50:44,910
We have for quite some time. Yeah. Yes.

337
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:54,570
I'm not sure how, like lower income countries are seeing an increase in non-communicable diseases while still having issues with infectious diseases.

338
00:50:55,320 --> 00:51:01,290
Is that very different in the higher income countries where you have less of a mix of all old issues?

339
00:51:02,150 --> 00:51:15,570
And, you know, you could see both countries, both high income countries, we still see false positives indeed in high income countries.

340
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:19,740
You don't save. There are fewer. And then.

341
00:51:20,790 --> 00:51:22,410
Of communicable diseases.

342
00:51:23,010 --> 00:51:35,790
And I would also say the lung communicable disease in a lot of the low income countries is probably a haven to got to get as high as it should.

343
00:51:36,390 --> 00:51:44,790
It's a relatively high low lower and doesn't you know, ratings no word in the.

344
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:51,780
We're to date. No group has come since the transition.

345
00:51:52,140 --> 00:52:00,840
What's this, by the way? What's the stage you think we are now where you have this fantastic.

346
00:52:02,430 --> 00:52:04,500
Theory of the device.

347
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:15,570
We also have this device, the one and the second encapsulated in the logical transition slides and lets us talk about the where we are.

348
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:47,420
Now we head to the suburbs. Deflation. Earlier we talked about the different time periods.

349
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:55,620
I am going to ask where we are. You can quickly look through your slides and see where we are.

350
00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:07,670
You're free. Just a. No, no, you're correct.

351
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:12,780
Everyone has different.

352
00:53:14,570 --> 00:53:28,990
I think you're transitioning from phase three age groups for overlap, Mr. Degenerative for stress and stress as of May and before it's a decline.

353
00:53:29,170 --> 00:53:34,820
See pretty mortality, aging, emerging disease.

354
00:53:35,390 --> 00:53:40,610
We are starting to see a little bit of the merging with.

355
00:53:42,030 --> 00:53:50,280
With all that because like obviously college but also like the last few years we've seen a lot of outbreaks.

356
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:53,520
So we're seeing that like emerging diseases again.

357
00:53:53,520 --> 00:54:00,240
But I still think that we're mostly focused on a lot of more heart diseases and general degenerative diseases.

358
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:08,730
We're doing high doses of the degenerative diseases, non-communicable diseases.

359
00:54:08,730 --> 00:54:18,030
We also see emerging infectious. Do we have any is the future stages as far?

360
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:27,830
Espouse the quality of life with the persistence of inequalities, something we worry about.

361
00:54:28,590 --> 00:54:34,950
I think it also depends on the country. I mean, like everywhere, we definitely see persistent inequalities.

362
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:42,630
Like depending on where you look in the world, they can go from like three to maybe five.

363
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:48,410
Yeah, definitely. Good.

364
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:51,470
Thank you. Any other comments? And.

365
00:54:56,950 --> 00:55:06,970
I think we're kind of starting to see like people almost are starting to address five persistent inequalities with the idea of stress.

366
00:55:07,870 --> 00:55:19,000
I think there's a lot more research recently on like stress and racism and different like minority groups and how kind of all of it overlaps.

367
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:22,930
So I think we're like another overreaction.

368
00:55:23,050 --> 00:55:32,020
And I think at one point you really thought through the some transition reading type,

369
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:44,560
but now we really see maybe the characters subtle differences, stage all kind of person to thing.

370
00:55:45,190 --> 00:55:51,250
So this makes the you know requires our we have some.

371
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:58,830
Different to some. Just to focus on one type of doesn't do.

372
00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:04,120
I think there we have some more. You know.

373
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:12,340
Inequality, the role in epidemic disease.

374
00:56:12,610 --> 00:56:17,200
And of course, do so in a way.

375
00:56:18,530 --> 00:56:25,160
Do we really know? Which is thanks to all these serial murders next to this car?

376
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:36,530
No, but it's a sense of kind of work. What is important is for us to recalculate, you know, the coexistence.

377
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:50,200
That's. Coming up, a painful and delightful music which is really required us to take her into grace, her disciplined approach.

378
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:55,900
And the reason is, you know, I think, you know,

379
00:56:55,900 --> 00:57:06,490
you kind of think about why are we want to study links between those who have come to the ecosystem and to how the human body.

380
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:12,200
Human immunity. HAMBY She.

381
00:57:13,410 --> 00:57:19,080
That's all changed due to the exposure of the different types of the disease.

382
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:26,920
And so you may not necessarily be just exposed to only infectious disease.

383
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:40,580
So when you are exposed to both. Your your response would be ship and you are only supposed to one time.

384
00:57:41,210 --> 00:57:45,130
That's why it's become important to understand the link.

385
00:57:45,590 --> 00:57:53,170
Epidemiological study generates evidence to show the associations cumulative.

386
00:57:54,250 --> 00:58:00,950
That's how that's really is that how that link.

387
00:58:03,210 --> 00:58:20,970
Biological or cancer genes that could you look at the COVID 19 pandemic experience and this is a systematically and that's something to do.

388
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:25,130
This infection caused this storm.

389
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:40,150
And knew in the infected individuals that have also impacted different organs of the human system for someone else and for that person.

390
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:54,830
And some severe case definitely experienced more than one or two cases, which you may have more confined in, you know,

391
00:58:54,830 --> 00:59:02,450
with COVID 19, if there's any research on how it like I guess for individuals with like underlying health issues,

392
00:59:02,450 --> 00:59:15,860
how it may have made like cause increases in like non-communicable conditions or like severity like due to infection, what's the status here?

393
00:59:16,530 --> 00:59:26,970
Or there has been a different report talking about some of the impacts.

394
00:59:26,990 --> 00:59:38,450
But on the other hand, a lot of the individuals that had also relatively limited the disease, so some people recovered very well.

395
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:44,710
And the you know, the recent wave of the COVID case in China Central,

396
00:59:44,810 --> 00:59:54,320
all my extended family, except of my own parents who didn't give the country home.

397
00:59:54,620 --> 01:00:02,870
Everyone else is gone, but most of them still recovered pretty quickly.

398
01:00:02,870 --> 01:00:10,850
And the hope is a reminder of the data. I think, oh, the age of the people did affect me more.

399
01:00:11,810 --> 01:00:19,670
This has been one of the best of my knowledge of what's happened in China recently.

400
01:00:19,670 --> 01:00:25,130
Everyone is probably all the first wave opens up.

401
01:00:25,790 --> 01:00:40,989
And yeah, everyone I know my former classmates and my extended families and my parents who are the fly what excuse my family that's

402
01:00:40,990 --> 01:00:51,710
the most of them seem to have to recover quickly so we don't really know for sure this has been a difference of findings.

403
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:58,130
I guess this part of where it takes some time to to learn.

404
01:01:01,590 --> 01:01:10,400
I was just going to ask him, how do you think this chart is really shifted by like the availability of like good judges?

405
01:01:10,410 --> 01:01:11,100
Because I know,

406
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:20,610
especially with like and like garbage codes have like increased online and like based on like countries that already have like a lot of garbage codes.

407
01:01:21,150 --> 01:01:25,900
Like, they sort of don't have the resources to be able to like, accurately address this.

408
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:33,720
Like, how do you think that will shift to this? I think that's why I don't ask you to, you know.

409
01:01:34,690 --> 01:01:48,580
Necessarily pay a lot of attention that actually finding it to where can I almost increase that I would not say 100%.

410
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:56,500
I think that you would change, of course, if you read in the paper, kind of the major findings are based.

411
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:02,800
To broaden the base for any findings.

412
01:02:02,950 --> 01:02:07,440
That's the first time that people get close to the things that they deserve.

413
01:02:07,750 --> 01:02:11,380
Then that's the results, of course.

414
01:02:12,550 --> 01:02:17,590
So this is why you always want to read To Get Richer.

415
01:02:18,370 --> 01:02:32,640
So with critical and critical reading, this important whatever study should be or you could in your own study, you want to ask this?

416
01:02:33,340 --> 01:02:41,080
Yeah, that's a good question. And to how we use, you know, the research funding.

417
01:02:41,350 --> 01:02:51,040
It really depends on how the results are. Then I think in the course of the what's this major funding really is?

418
01:02:52,210 --> 01:03:02,440
Use the data sets, as you see from the banks in the most impacted region.

419
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:14,660
There's at least according to the data. So in a way, unless we address that, that these requirements issue across school, we will always have.

420
01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:21,340
Absolutely. We may have more violence is data from.

421
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:27,750
Some countries. We want to have.

422
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:33,940
Groups in the States are forced to reduce the population with reading needs of data,

423
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:48,070
mostly to inform the development of public health policy and make a decision if we need to the vaccine or if the vaccine is working.

424
01:03:48,430 --> 01:03:51,270
Vaccine is a major publication of this.

425
01:03:51,340 --> 01:04:03,400
I I'd like to use, for example, you know, one of the reasons when you introduce that you are passive, you want to monitor the outcomes of sex.

426
01:04:03,820 --> 01:04:14,320
But then if you couldn't even do active surveillance like for the vaccine preventable disease or vaccine,

427
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:18,460
how could you see how you can do an accurate assessment?

428
01:04:18,790 --> 01:04:27,339
When we talk about massive ship to ships of sex or you could also study age 65,

429
01:04:27,340 --> 01:04:40,850
you can't really have the diagnosis after you look at some of the human diseases also and have very different circumstances.

430
01:04:41,230 --> 01:04:46,150
So are you across the age groups and then nice ship.

431
01:04:47,730 --> 01:04:49,230
And you know.

432
01:04:50,940 --> 01:05:07,720
Peter, you had very different hands on one and done and then you can't there is really no very reliable and sensitive background to what you do.

433
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:16,050
And when you access the HPV tax and subsidies, you don't see necessarily a measure of the cancer.

434
01:05:16,740 --> 01:05:22,620
Instead, you do surveillance for the strains.

435
01:05:23,790 --> 01:05:36,150
Of HPV, causing determinants of and known to be the cause for cervical cancer or as of June 10th.

436
01:05:37,860 --> 01:05:47,710
But if you don't have the tools to do this so you can come and do something about soccer races and remaining how you keep it.

437
01:05:47,740 --> 01:05:54,190
BERGEN Country is also looking at pets to tackle the dumpster fire, which has why?

438
01:05:54,780 --> 01:06:03,300
Because they don't have access to the treatment given they know is their only hope is that basic first line

439
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:10,980
treatment they come to ready access and testing that would require a lot of producers that's not available.

440
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:19,260
So it's quite a complicated situation when you come to study global burden of disease.

441
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:25,230
Yeah. What's. As a question.

442
01:06:26,490 --> 01:06:31,470
So we I think it's a priority.

443
01:06:32,070 --> 01:06:36,360
I don't want to let you go. But if you have questions.

444
01:06:40,630 --> 01:06:47,050
If you don't have any questions that we will talk about the next next class.

445
01:06:47,590 --> 01:06:58,840
And I think that project would be good. Also, you can look at The Lancet and see how you can do a little more writing in,

446
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:06,460
you know, get a clearer picture and try to tie these two different systems together.

447
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:15,140
I, I think it's pretty interesting and I don't give you assignments to work across.
