00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:13,329
Hello, welcome to this lecture
covering inference for binary and

2
00:00:13,329 --> 00:00:14,811
categorical outcomes.

3
00:00:14,811 --> 00:00:20,125
In this lecture we will specifically focus
on the chi-square test of association and

4
00:00:20,125 --> 00:00:23,387
how it is used to compare
proportions in two groups.

5
00:00:23,387 --> 00:00:27,046
Now, often our goal is to see if
different populations have different

6
00:00:27,046 --> 00:00:29,600
probabilities of events or outcomes.

7
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,900
For example,
is the probability of stroke in smokers

8
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:36,500
different from the probability
of stroke in non-smokers?

9
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,700
And if they are different probabilities
then we say that smoking has some

10
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,900
association with stroke.

11
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,000
And so in this module we'll show
you how to test for differences

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,825
in the probabilities of different health
outcomes among two groups of individuals.

13
00:00:49,825 --> 00:00:54,800
Our learning objectives are first to
apply statistical inference concepts

14
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,900
to one binary outcome that is
measured on two groups of people.

15
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,557
We then will state the null and

16
00:01:00,557 --> 00:01:04,867
alternative hypotheses that we use in
a chi-squared test of association and

17
00:01:04,867 --> 00:01:09,327
then identify the statistics that we
use to compute a chi-squared statistic.

18
00:01:09,327 --> 00:01:13,505
Now, we return to the example we used in
a previous lecture in which we had two

19
00:01:13,505 --> 00:01:14,956
populations of infants.

20
00:01:14,956 --> 00:01:19,321
We had a control population of infants and
an intervention population of infants, and

21
00:01:19,321 --> 00:01:23,327
we wanted to know after two years does
the probability of carries differ between

22
00:01:23,327 --> 00:01:26,497
the population of infants that
were given the intervention and

23
00:01:26,497 --> 00:01:29,824
the population of infants that
were not given the intervention.

24
00:01:29,824 --> 00:01:33,932
In other words, after two years does the
proportion of infants with Caries differ

25
00:01:33,932 --> 00:01:37,500
between the intervention and
the control populations.

26
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,800
Now, to formally answer this question, we
will use the hypothesis test method known

27
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,700
as the chi-square test of association, and

28
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,600
like any method we have two
hypotheses we are looking to compare.

29
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,697
We have a null hypothesis, and in this
case the null hypothesis states that

30
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:57,415
developing Caries is independent
of receiving the intervention.

31
00:01:57,415 --> 00:02:01,400
This is the hypothesis
we would like to reject.

32
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:05,900
Now, if carries is independent of
the intervention, then the control and

33
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:10,800
intervention populations must have
the same probability of developing Caries.

34
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,983
In other words, P1 must be equal to P2.

35
00:02:13,983 --> 00:02:17,869
The alternative hypothesis for
a chi-square test of association states

36
00:02:17,869 --> 00:02:21,763
that developing Caries is associated
with receiving the intervention.

37
00:02:21,763 --> 00:02:25,389
And if there is an association
between carries and

38
00:02:25,389 --> 00:02:29,705
the two groups then the two
populations must have different

39
00:02:29,705 --> 00:02:34,816
probabilities of developing Caries,
or that P1 is not equal to P2.

40
00:02:34,816 --> 00:02:38,489
Now, to compare these two hypotheses
we need to collect data and

41
00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:42,650
compute a test statistic which leads
to a p-value and a final decision.

42
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:47,700
So the first step is to display our
data in a two-by-two contingency table.

43
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,108
Now, we saw this table
in a previous lecture.

44
00:02:50,108 --> 00:02:54,534
This table has two rows and two columns
with the rows indicating which babies were

45
00:02:54,534 --> 00:02:58,851
in the intervention of the sample and
which babies were in the control sample.

46
00:02:58,851 --> 00:03:02,063
And the columns tell us which babies
developed Caries in which did not.

47
00:03:02,063 --> 00:03:06,654
The first row indicates that there were
68 babies in the intervention sample,

48
00:03:06,654 --> 00:03:09,842
six of whom developed Caries and
62 who to who did not.

49
00:03:09,842 --> 00:03:12,972
And we had 36 infants
in the control sample,

50
00:03:12,972 --> 00:03:16,435
10 of whom developed Caries and
26 who did not.

51
00:03:16,435 --> 00:03:23,971
And across all 104 babies in the entire
study 16 developed Caries and 88 did not.

52
00:03:23,971 --> 00:03:25,981
Now, we want to compare our data and

53
00:03:25,981 --> 00:03:30,000
see how much it might conflict
with the null hypothesis.

54
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,812
And so therefore we ask the question,
if the null hypothesis was true what

55
00:03:34,812 --> 00:03:38,859
is the probability of any infant
ending up in the yellow cell?

56
00:03:38,859 --> 00:03:44,700
What is the probability that an infant has
Caries and was in the intervention group?

57
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:49,161
Well, that probability is the product
of the two individual probabilities,

58
00:03:49,161 --> 00:03:51,663
the probability of developing Caries, and

59
00:03:51,663 --> 00:03:54,515
the probability of
receiving the intervention.

60
00:03:54,515 --> 00:03:58,577
Now, we do not know the values of
either one of these probabilities,

61
00:03:58,577 --> 00:04:01,500
but we can estimate them from our data.

62
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:06,000
The probability of developing
Caries is 16 over 104.

63
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,900
Again, if the null is true, then all
104 infants come from one group of

64
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:15,600
individuals, and we saw that in all 104
babies 16 of them developed Caries.

65
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,300
And therefore this
probability is 16 over 104.

66
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:24,687
Likewise, in all 104 babies 68 of
them were in the intervention group.

67
00:04:24,687 --> 00:04:28,683
And therefore the probability of
receiving the intervention for

68
00:04:28,683 --> 00:04:32,400
any baby in the sample is 68 over 104.

69
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,215
Now that we have these two
probabilities we multiply them by

70
00:04:37,215 --> 00:04:42,416
the sample size of 104 and
we see that among all 104 infants

71
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:48,122
in the sample 10.5 of them should
be in the upper left-hand cell.

72
00:04:48,122 --> 00:04:51,409
Now again, this is simply
a mathematical calculation so

73
00:04:51,409 --> 00:04:54,017
we can get values that
are not whole numbers.

74
00:04:54,017 --> 00:04:59,224
But, this computation tells me that there
is a conflict between the null hypothesis,

75
00:04:59,224 --> 00:05:03,574
which said I should have ten-and-a-half
babies in the cell, and 6,

76
00:05:03,574 --> 00:05:06,800
which is the number I observed in my data.

77
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,888
Now, this computation is
simply the row total for

78
00:05:10,888 --> 00:05:17,523
that cell times the column total for that
cell divided by the entire sample size.

79
00:05:17,523 --> 00:05:22,522
Because again, the formula that I showed
you earlier has a 104 in the numerator and

80
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:26,149
a 104 in the denominator,
those two 104s will cancel.

81
00:05:26,149 --> 00:05:30,922
And my computation is therefore
simply the row total of 68 times

82
00:05:30,922 --> 00:05:35,693
the column total of 16 divided
by the sample size of 104, and

83
00:05:35,693 --> 00:05:38,933
that gives me ten-and-a-half infants.

84
00:05:38,933 --> 00:05:44,550
So again, across all four cells in the
table this is what I observed in my data.

85
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:48,529
If I now apply that computation
to every one of the four cells

86
00:05:48,529 --> 00:05:53,400
this is what should have happened
if the null hypothesis was true.

87
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,100
I should have seen ten-and-a-half babies
in the upper left-hand cell, for example,

88
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:01,400
and I should have seen 30-and-a-half
babies in the lower right-hand cell.

89
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,700
You should notice that the row totals and
the column totals, and

90
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:08,300
therefore the overall total,
have all remained the same.

91
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,322
The only thing that has
changed is where the 104 for

92
00:06:11,322 --> 00:06:16,244
infants have ended up in the two-by-two
table, the four cells have changed values.

93
00:06:16,244 --> 00:06:20,533
And so again, I have what I observed
in my data in that two-by-two table,

94
00:06:20,533 --> 00:06:24,755
and then in the other two-by-two table
it tells me what I should have seen

95
00:06:24,755 --> 00:06:26,500
if the null was true.

96
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:31,109
And so therefore I ask, do we see any
differences between these two tables?

97
00:06:31,109 --> 00:06:34,600
And this is what we do with
a Pearson's chi-squared statistic.

98
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,890
We take the difference of each observed
cell with the corresponding value in

99
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:40,037
the expected cell.

100
00:06:40,037 --> 00:06:43,774
And we square those differences because
again, we don't care which value

101
00:06:43,774 --> 00:06:47,706
is larger, we want to get rid of the
positive and negative signs on the values.

102
00:06:47,706 --> 00:06:49,900
These numbers are our evidence,

103
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:54,800
they tell us how much conflict there is
between the null hypothesis and the data.

104
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,800
Then we divide each of those squared
differences by the expected cell count,

105
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,700
this controls for the skepticism or the
sampling variability from study to study.

106
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:06,273
And then we add all those values together.

107
00:07:06,273 --> 00:07:11,100
And so I now show you the computation that
corresponds to the data in my example.

108
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:17,230
There are four squared differences divided
by the expected value in the table.

109
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:22,700
I add up these four numbers
giving me a total of 6.7.

110
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:26,360
This number now must be
converted to a p-value.

111
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,216
So we look this test statistic up in
a corresponding distribution, for

112
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:34,780
a chi-square test that distribution is
known as a chi-squared distribution, and

113
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:39,345
a chi-square distribution changes with
something called the degrees of freedom,

114
00:07:39,345 --> 00:07:44,000
which is a quantity we saw when we
talked about analysis of variance.

115
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,959
Now, for any chi-square test
the appropriate degrees of freedom is

116
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:52,477
the number of rows minus 1, times the
number of columns in the table minus 1.

117
00:07:52,477 --> 00:07:56,646
And again, the row represents the number
of groups that we're comparing to each

118
00:07:56,646 --> 00:08:00,644
other, and the number of columns is
the number of categories in the outcome.

119
00:08:00,644 --> 00:08:01,981
And so therefore for

120
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:07,958
a two-by-two table the degrees of freedom
are 1 (2-1) because we have two groups,

121
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:12,689
and (2-1) because we have two values for
each outcome, yes or no.

122
00:08:12,689 --> 00:08:16,615
And to note, when the distribution
was a standard normal distribution,

123
00:08:16,615 --> 00:08:19,148
when we had a two-sample t-test for
example,

124
00:08:19,148 --> 00:08:23,455
recall that the critical value we used for
significance was approximately two,

125
00:08:23,455 --> 00:08:27,217
our test statistic had to be bigger
than two or less than negative two.

126
00:08:27,217 --> 00:08:31,759
In this case the appropriate critical
value with a chi-square distribution with

127
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:36,200
one degree of freedom is four,
which is the square of two.

128
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:41,169
And so now I show you what a chi-square
distribution with one degree of freedom

129
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:42,006
looks like.

130
00:08:42,006 --> 00:08:45,857
For a chi-square distribution with
one degree of freedom, as I said,

131
00:08:45,857 --> 00:08:49,901
the critical value is approximately four,
it's actually 3.84, and

132
00:08:49,901 --> 00:08:53,450
that is represented by the vertical
yellow line in this picture.

133
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:58,148
Any test statistic to the right
of that vertical line represents

134
00:08:58,148 --> 00:09:01,300
a p-value less than 0.05.

135
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,600
Now, our test statistic was 6.7,

136
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,300
which is even further to
the right in the distribution, and

137
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:12,100
the p-value corresponding to
that test statistic is 0.009.

138
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,930
Therefore, we would conclude
that we have modest evidence

139
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:18,737
that the intervention does have an
association with the prevention of Caries.

140
00:09:18,737 --> 00:09:22,400
We have rejected the null hypothesis.

141
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:26,980
Now, a chi-square test of association
can tell us whether two populations have

142
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:29,757
different probabilities for
a binary outcome.

143
00:09:29,757 --> 00:09:34,332
However, we also want to be able to
quantify how different those two

144
00:09:34,332 --> 00:09:36,834
probabilities are from each other.

145
00:09:36,834 --> 00:09:39,386
We do this through a quantity
known as an odds ratio,

146
00:09:39,386 --> 00:09:42,982
which will be explained
in a future lecture.
