Hi, my name is Mira and interview in Cairo. So first first question, why are you interested in this position?

2
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,120
All right, so can I just turn my position first? Oh, yeah.

3
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,400
Oh, let's just say this is for.

4
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:21,780
And I recently interviewed for, like, a construction company, and I'll just go into one of their number four industrial hygiene franchises.

5
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:26,879
Okay. All right. So I'm interested in this position because this organization is global,

6
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:33,930
which means that I would be able to get experience with not only legal jurisdiction and occupational exposure limits in the U.S.,

7
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,990
but also around the world. So I think that would be useful for me.

8
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,209
I think that'd be great for my professional experience.

9
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:43,500
And it's also allowing me an opportunity to utilize my skills in computer science and public health,

10
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:50,340
as I'm sure that the management of data from a global standpoint is much more difficult and can only be made more efficient through automation.

11
00:00:52,770 --> 00:01:00,570
What are some of your strengths and weaknesses? I see great strength of mine is that while I think I am very data oriented,

12
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:06,479
I think that I can transition a lot of the knowledge that I have in that field to do with that of public health.

13
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,680
Because I can I can build rapport very easily and I can also bring all of the data that

14
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,510
I analyze to specific outcomes that show up in public health or within this field.

15
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:20,880
So it's easy for me to communicate my results from the employees to upper level management.

16
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:26,280
But I will say that a great weakness of mine is that I have absolutely no work life balance,

17
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:32,340
and I know that that can negatively affect my team if I'm not at my best self or not at a point of wellness.

18
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:37,860
So I am working on improving those and that I picked up a digital planner's.

19
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:43,650
I'm marrying that to physical planners, also making sure now that I'm doing more for myself,

20
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,970
eating more, making sure that I pick up extracurriculars that benefit me in the community.

21
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:53,010
Excellent. So why should we hire you over other applicants?

22
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:58,110
I think that a big question that I get from my other interviews or that I get

23
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:02,760
from other individuals is why did you pick up computer science in public health?

24
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:08,490
And honestly, it's I think we can't really make any changes in industrial hygiene or in public health unless

25
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:13,430
we incorporate more of the digitization that a lot of the modern workplaces are utilizing,

26
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:22,950
utilizing nowadays. I recognize that industrial hygiene, one of our biggest lagging characteristics of our field is that we are not automated.

27
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:29,310
And I think that if we're able to marry a lot of our work to that of a computer system

28
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:33,300
that we'd be able to communicate better and also implement change a lot quicker.

29
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:41,340
That was pretty good job. Thank you. Oh, I think I repeated a lot.
