1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,270
Had started. What does that really mean?

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:17,760
Happy birthday, everyone. So we're gonna finish the culture, focus on culture, and then you're going to come back and get us on social justice.

3
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:26,010
So he has some announcements for the class, and I don't want to cover myself, so I don't want to.

4
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:30,390
I'm still kind of confused, but we're going to make some changes to the schedule.

5
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:37,200
He's going to go over that, but I think you'll make changes and then also details on the final project.

6
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:46,430
And so any announcements would you want us any event ready for break?

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:01:01,440
You need to. Okay. So we're going to try to get through this somewhat quickly, but I don't want it to be a bore.

8
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,479
So we all kind of feel we stopped here on this slide.

9
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,350
So this was last night we talked about last week, last Tuesday.

10
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:15,140
Does anyone want to get us started on what we talked about on Tuesday?

11
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:21,510
So can someone give a few people maybe give a quick highlight of what we talked about?

12
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:38,090
What is the topic? Okay. We were like defining what culture as like.

13
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:44,860
Like you would really see different like discipline definitions of culture of like what culture means us person.

14
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:54,250
Thank you. Awesome. Anybody else? He's tired.

15
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:04,990
Well, yes, that is correct. So he went through different disciplines and their definition of what culture is, what culture means.

16
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:09,520
So especially if you weren't here on Tuesday, definitely take a look at the lecture.

17
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:14,259
I think it's some pretty cool definitions that you can use and like feature papers and stuff like that.

18
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:19,870
So I think that especially those slides are good slides to just keep handy whatever you want to refer back to them.

19
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:30,080
But yeah, so we went through some definitions and we also talked about what that actually means for people and communities and stuff of that nature.

20
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:34,600
We also ended on this slide about misuses of culture and public health.

21
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,610
Somebody want to I mean, it's right here on the screen, too.

22
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:45,309
But if somebody want to share maybe one thing that they've noticed in the way we talk about culture,

23
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:55,900
in the way we interact with different cultures through public health, or how we how do we misuse that experience or people's cultural experiences?

24
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:12,899
Anyone? Well, I think sometimes we tend to take one person's experience and generalize it to everyone,

25
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:17,040
even if they do share the same culture, necessarily have the same experiences.

26
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:24,960
Yeah, definitely. We do tend to generalize and make assumptions, and even if that's true for one person, it might not be true for everyone.

27
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,149
We also talked about subculture as well,

28
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:36,130
so that that was one area where they talked about different groups within groups that might have some differences in culture.

29
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:41,340
And so a couple of the things I definitely want to get to on this slide,

30
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:52,140
so this is the second slide that we didn't get to on Tuesday is kind of related to your point that sometimes we either tokenize or generalize,

31
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:57,600
but we also overemphasize sometimes what culture means and how that impacts people's health decisions.

32
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:04,260
So while culture is an important aspect of health behavior and decision making and things

33
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:08,820
of that sort is not the end all be all is not going to be the sole driving force.

34
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:14,370
So sometimes we do overemphasize it's important, definitely, and it's an important consideration.

35
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:22,130
But we want to make sure that we aren't overemphasizing what that means to a person and why they're making certain decisions.

36
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,510
And that also goes to assumptions, as we talked about.

37
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:34,469
Let's I keep saying last week, as we talked about on Tuesday, and secondly, another misuse that we tend to do in public health.

38
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:41,400
And also this goes for other disciplines as well. But we do avoid health behavior change because it is perceived as part of a culture.

39
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:47,669
So we talked a little bit about a little bit about nutrition on Tuesday and how that is typically

40
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:51,479
a good example that we tend to lean on when we're talking about culture in public health,

41
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:56,280
because one of the biggest areas of our culture is through our food.

42
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:07,290
And so that those types of interventions are really important and really, really critical that we make sure that we keep in mind people's culture.

43
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:14,339
We want to make sure that we're not trying to avoid behavior change or help behavior change just

44
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:18,390
because it's perceived as a part of culture that we want to make sure to keep that balance.

45
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:25,330
So finally, using culture to exclude certain groups of people from receiving public health services.

46
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:38,190
Anyone think of an example of this? Yeah.

47
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:48,209
Maybe if you're trying to like, say you're trying to tailor an intervention to like having a group of people that, like, speaks the language,

48
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:55,770
but then eventually you end up excluding people in that culture that might be experiencing the same respect if you don't speak that language.

49
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:01,620
Yeah, that's a great example. Great example. So for those, since I know you're in the back of the room, Twitter, feed it.

50
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:07,860
So sometimes we may exclude people like if the intervention is based on language,

51
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:14,219
we might exclude people who might also benefit from the intervention just because they might not speak the language,

52
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:19,620
but they might still be a part of the culture. Any other examples that anyone can think of?

53
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:23,700
This one might be a little bit odd or different or something that makes you think like.

54
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:30,160
Yeah. I think like I think of like some neighborhoods like that.

55
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,969
Maybe like the neighborhood as a whole doesn't have a whole lot of access to health care.

56
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:39,070
But if there's like a Internet or like a clinic, like specifically for, I don't know,

57
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:43,959
Spanish speaking people, there's still like the rest of the neighborhood, like, is there anything for them?

58
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:49,810
And like, is there any mechanism to still receive care from that one clinic or.

59
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:57,790
Yeah, definitely. Yeah. I think that's a great example too, especially because we talked about on to say environment and how culture isn't always

60
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:04,449
necessarily just focused on someone's race or their religion or areas like that.

61
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:08,859
But it also could be like people who are in the same area or their environment,

62
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:12,900
they share an environment that might have a particular culture that might need to be considered as well.

63
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:20,990
So. Yes. Think about is how like maybe different cultural or religious observances meet place.

64
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:27,429
Yeah. A lot of the time we tend to make a lot of people and especially like the government and all,

65
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:32,890
they tend to make people feel Christian like Western norms of like and schedules.

66
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:36,399
So let's say like specific holidays or observances,

67
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:46,240
like people will like either have access to technology or they may be fasting or so on and

68
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,730
sometimes not accommodating to those factors and receiving services can be really impactful.

69
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,149
Right. That's huge. And especially when we think about kind of how society has in this country,

70
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:04,990
how society has framed religion to be like one religion is like all the other

71
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:09,310
things that we do is related to Christian holidays like and things of that sort.

72
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:16,360
Calendars are centered around that and we don't consider that other religions don't ascribe to that.

73
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,840
And it's definitely not something that, you know,

74
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:28,450
is valuable to make sure that we're inclusive of that and that we're accepting of other religions in other cultures in a way that's significant.

75
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:32,360
Right. And not just like observed or. Oh, like, you know.

76
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:37,720
Yes. We don't recognize this holiday on your work calendar. And so you don't get this day off, but you can take the day.

77
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:43,780
You know, that is that's a completely different that's completely different than actually observing it.

78
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:52,809
Right. And so we do tend to exclude people who don't subscribe to what is considered, you know, what I'm looking for?

79
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:56,740
I'm like, oh, because I don't want to use the word normal we talked about.

80
00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:00,650
Right. You say normative. Normative, right?

81
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:04,360
Yes, exactly. Dramatically. Exactly.

82
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:08,440
You can categorized fans as words. Exactly.

83
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:17,530
So any others? Yeah, I'm thinking about like certain groups of people that like I thinking about a do a client that

84
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:22,570
I had who for her religious and culture reasons like did not want to see a male provider.

85
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:28,420
And so if there weren't any others available like she was just not going to see anyone.

86
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:33,940
Think about like how representation is really important in public health services and medical services,

87
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:40,150
because sometimes that can be like the identity of the provider can be like a barrier for someone going or not going to the doctor.

88
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,240
Yeah, that's that's huge. And that's I'm glad you raised that.

89
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:47,080
I was just like, especially with the election that just passed and everything,

90
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:52,809
the different states have been really highlighted and they were talking about how in Georgia they were saying about half

91
00:09:52,810 --> 00:10:02,110
of the states are states or about half of the counties in Georgia did not have an obese UI in in the state of Georgia.

92
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:08,140
And so that is an important consideration that we might need, not that we need to take into account.

93
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:15,190
And workforce is a really big issue that I don't think that is really as addressed in public health as it could be.

94
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:24,520
People talk about it, but it is it is hard to to address, but it's also something that's necessary to address because we do have people who,

95
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:31,390
you know, where where that workforce might impact them negatively with their health outcomes.

96
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:39,510
I share one example. So one that people don't often think about is ways in which color sometimes brings

97
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:45,100
blue people is when there's programs for kind of a broader LGBTQ plus community.

98
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:51,070
You know, people have varying degrees of comfort with their sexuality and their gender identity and expression,

99
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:55,450
and sometimes programs or services can be very visible.

100
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:58,359
And so people may not want to go to that clinic.

101
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:06,399
So if there's, you know, a lot of signage and it's very it's in a place where people can see who goes in and out of there.

102
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:10,690
There may be some folks that because of, you know, stigma and discrimination,

103
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:16,360
just being earlier in their developmental journey may not go and they won't go to a regular,

104
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:21,250
you know, general clinic because they don't feel comfortable there.

105
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:24,760
And so then sometimes they're in the space of they don't have anywhere to get services.

106
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,300
That's a great point. Thank you. Or is it that? Okay.

107
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,750
So moving forward, so culture and context.

108
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:36,920
So we'll talk a little bit about this. I'll make sure that we have plenty of time.

109
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:45,259
So I'll try to fly through these slides a little bit. But context can be viewed as the circumstances that form the setting for an event,

110
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:49,250
statement or idea and in terms of which it can be fully understood and assessed.

111
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:57,440
So it's important to stress. It is important to stress the importance of always seeing culture within a particular context.

112
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:02,659
So context is really important. It matters a lot and our work is really essential.

113
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:10,010
So I think even beyond considering culture and making sure we're taking into account that when you're working in communities,

114
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:16,640
you have to consider their culture. You also have to make sure that you're addressing or thinking about the context in which that culture exists.

115
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:22,040
And part of that is because of the historical, economic, social, political,

116
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:26,840
etc., those elements that really impact what is really going on in real life.

117
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:33,200
So the culture of any group of people at any point in time can be influenced by many factors.

118
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,189
We talked about this a little bit on Tuesday and how culture can shift and change,

119
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:44,630
and there's really a lot of factors that really impact what culture looks like, but especially what culture looks like within specific contexts.

120
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:52,970
So it's also impossible to solely isolate cultural beliefs and behaviors from the social context.

121
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:00,230
They really go hand-in-hand. So you really have to think about the context in which you're working or engaging in.

122
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:11,740
So to go through a couple of models and cultural adaptation before we go into that, we'll make this quick.

123
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:16,090
They won't want to take a stab at this as an acceptable phrase.

124
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:22,810
Guys, I didn't say that. But in that critical sense, I know, like, oh, I didn't say that.

125
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:30,610
But does anybody want to try to define what cultural adaptation means or what that might look like?

126
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:35,800
So either define it or maybe give an example of what that might look like in context.

127
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:47,260
A lot of, like, stairs. Yeah. Me.

128
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:56,610
In terms of like culturally tailored and like health interventions, cultural adaptation,

129
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:03,420
maybe for specific populations fitting in and different cultural values and mission objectives.

130
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:09,810
Or it may mean fitting specific activities to the culture of the community that you're working on.

131
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:15,360
Just assuming it felt like getting the input of people from different needs.

132
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:22,860
Exactly. Yes. So that is exactly correct. So thinking about and there are different phrases, as you mentioned,

133
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:28,410
there are different ways of people saying a lot of similar words, but meaning very similar things.

134
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:35,549
But culture adaptation is definitely part of the action of adapting interventions and tailoring

135
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:40,590
them to the culture in which you're working in or the context in which you're working in.

136
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:44,069
And so there are a lot of positives and negatives to that.

137
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:51,810
And so I think that on the positive end that when we have interventions that have been shown to be successful,

138
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:58,260
it is important to think about if it's successful in this community and this culture within this context,

139
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:05,700
could it be successful in other contexts as well? That saves a lot of money and time and resources to try to adapt interventions.

140
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:12,599
However, I think that it's also important to consider that, like you mentioned as well, sometimes when we do that,

141
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:17,520
we miss things and we're not really addressing what the community really needs and what

142
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:21,870
is really the root cause of the issue or the root of what we're trying to get at.

143
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:25,439
And so I think it's important that we do talk about cultural adaptation.

144
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,629
We'll talk about some models, and it's important to consider.

145
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:33,540
But you also want to make sure that you're not leaning into some of those negative tropes that we kind of sometimes like fall into.

146
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:42,520
So it's been defined as a systematic modification of the evidence based treatment or intervention that considers language,

147
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:50,229
culture or context in such a way that it's compatible with clients, cultural patterns, meetings and values like cultural attunement.

148
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:54,060
And like I said, there's a lot of different words as well on this slide.

149
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:59,920
But cultural attunement has been used to describe additions to evidence based therapies

150
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:04,060
that are intended to boost engagement and retention of some cultural group numbers.

151
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:09,790
And then also all of these different words here as well.

152
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:16,660
I don't want to like list them all. They've all been used to describe deliberate efforts to increase pure and

153
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:21,130
effective effectiveness of interventions that are used within subcultural groups.

154
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:24,360
So these definitions are really important and really key.

155
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:29,859
So also, when you're reading papers for other classes and you're looking at interventions there,

156
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:32,810
you will find that people use a lot of these words interchangeably.

157
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:38,880
I think one thing that I think the field is doing a better job of defining what we mean when we say certain things,

158
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:43,959
but we want to make sure that we're reading these interventions. And when we're building our own interventions,

159
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:48,960
that we're using correct phrases and correct words that is really trying to get at what exactly are we doing?

160
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:55,840
Because are we trying to modify an evidence based intervention to a particular culture,

161
00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:01,719
or are we trying to make additions to evidence based therapies that exist that boost engagement?

162
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:07,600
So that's culture adaptation versus cultural attunement. So we want to make sure that we're using the right terminology as well.

163
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:19,040
So one model here is looking at the stages of culture adaptations of these interventions,

164
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:25,850
and it's similar to one of the other models that we looked at that talked about the stages of building and intervention.

165
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,830
There are some like overlaps.

166
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:34,730
I don't know if you recall this maybe like a couple weeks ago at this point, maybe even three when we talked about building interventions.

167
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:41,450
But these stages are really focused on how we adapt these interventions to different cultures and settings.

168
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:45,259
And so the first stage, of course, is information gathering to your point,

169
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:50,270
as well as the last when you are sharing how it's important that we really engage with communities and really

170
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:57,920
understand what the true issues are and how can we address them and how the community would like us to address them.

171
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:08,299
And then moving forward to stage two is kind of looking at how we adapt the intervention design and we kind of like do that preliminarily.

172
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:11,570
So we're kind of seeing what might work in the set.

173
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:18,260
The third stage is to kind of test it and see now that we've kind of made these changes and we've looked at it and we're like,

174
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:23,419
Oh, this might be a good idea. Based on the information that we've gathered now, we're looking to see if it actually works,

175
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:28,880
if there's some shred of evidence that this might be a good way to adapt this intervention.

176
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:36,829
And then the fourth stage is refining it. So we're constantly learning, we're looking back into, like I said,

177
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:42,670
we just tested is we're kind of looking into the results, seeing if there are any changes that were successful,

178
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:49,640
if looking into any results that were positive that really show we're doing a great job or at least we're headed in the right direction.

179
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:56,270
And so we want to refine that and make it better. And then finally you'll go into your trial as well.

180
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:04,870
And this model here, I will show an image of what this model looks like next.

181
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:11,710
But this model is a theoretical framework that centralizes culture in the study of how it

182
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:15,970
places culture really at the core of all of the steps that we just kind of went through.

183
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,250
So the development implementation and the evaluation of these interventions.

184
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:26,979
And so this model provides the opportunity to examine cultural practices that are critical to positive health

185
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:34,150
behaviors and really focuses on adverse influence of health as well and those factors related to that.

186
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:41,350
So I'm looking at this model here. You see that you see a few different things here.

187
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:46,150
You see cultural identity, relationships and expectations and also cultural empowerment.

188
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:50,530
So you'll notice that these circles all intersect in some way.

189
00:19:50,830 --> 00:20:00,130
They really overlap. And that really speaks to how these three areas are really important and really integral, and they really work together in a way.

190
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:06,880
And you can't really have or you shouldn't go to intervention without one of these areas.

191
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:13,540
And so looking at cultural identity.

192
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:24,550
So looking at the person's extended family, their neighborhood, what they might people define culture in different ways.

193
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:25,690
That's been talked about on Tuesday.

194
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:32,620
So this is definitely not an exhaustive, exhaustive list, but thinking about what makes someone's cultural identity,

195
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:38,709
who they are, what their culture is, and then also how does that relate to relationships and expectations?

196
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:43,930
So perceptions of others and things of that nature.

197
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:48,159
And then also how does how do the both of those relate to cultural empowerment?

198
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:54,190
And so how do we empower communities and people who are part of either one culture and

199
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:58,780
how do we engage in and work through that when we're building these interventions?

200
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:05,720
So finally, what does this all mean for public health interventions?

201
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:12,760
So the only thing I want to pull back is we really had a really great discussion on Tuesday.

202
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:20,120
But the final take home that I wanted everyone to make sure that they're aware of is we talked a lot about how important

203
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:26,749
culture is and how valuable it is to a person in their community and how a lot of people are protective over their culture.

204
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:31,600
Right. And I think that that is a really beautiful thing in this world.

205
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:42,350
And so I think it's really important that we make sure that we also protect that as well, and that we're not furthering further oppressing people,

206
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:48,560
that we're not using power and privilege in a way that stops down people's culture,

207
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:53,840
and that we're not using culture to get ahead and say, like, look, I understand, you know,

208
00:21:54,050 --> 00:22:00,130
these this group of people and I really am one with their culture and I really, you know,

209
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:05,870
have made a difference and that we don't kind of stand on that as a way of like lifting ourselves up,

210
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:11,540
but that we really, truly value people's culture and what it means to them in these interventions and in the work that we do.

211
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:21,380
So any anybody else want to share finally or in with this what this might mean to them or kind of what

212
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:25,790
all of this means for public health and like how you see it working in your future in public health.

213
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:41,840
No one has a future in public health. We wasted the whole time.

214
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:44,629
You know, is really important.

215
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:49,940
I really want to emphasize this because and that's why I wanted to hear from someone, because I think it's important that, you know,

216
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:54,500
when you're in the classroom and you're learning these things, that you're thinking about how it might apply to you in the future.

217
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:59,360
You know, we all have. I'm sure you all are probably interested in multiple different things.

218
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,740
Right. So you might not know exactly what that looks like or exactly what you want to do,

219
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:09,740
but you want to think about how culture might impact the many lives that we can see ourselves going in.

220
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:21,500
Think a question. So like, what are some steps you can take to avoid the, like, tokenization of culture, like step specific steps?

221
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,330
Yeah, I think that's a great question.

222
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:31,610
So going back one of our previous lectures as well, I think it starts with really working with communities and listening.

223
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:35,659
So I think that that is step number one is like not thinking that you're the expert

224
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:39,440
because you've done all these things and done all of this research in a particular area,

225
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:46,550
but that when you go into a new community or if you're working with a new subculture of a group that you've worked with before,

226
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:53,130
that you still take the time to not only sit and listen to them, but actually hear them as well.

227
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:57,770
So I think that that is definitely step number one to be able to make sure that you're not

228
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:05,180
furthering further oppressing them or taking advantage of someone's culture in your work.

229
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:09,120
So definitely step number one for sure. You have anything?

230
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:15,560
Yeah. So I think that's a really excellent question. And I think, yeah, I agree 100% with what Akila said.

231
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:23,720
I think another thing to do is to really do a lot of critical reflection with the group too,

232
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:28,310
to see if there are other segments of the population who may not have either the

233
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:32,990
opportunity or the freedom to be in those spaces when you're meeting with them.

234
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:42,200
So, you know, for instance, when I was talking about, you know, work with the LGBT community, if you're getting a group of community members,

235
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:48,110
they're going to be more likely people that to some degree are more out or have more of a self acceptance.

236
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:56,180
And so really, you know, working with your community group to think about who else might be missing from this table,

237
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:59,770
you know, who else may be dealing with some of these same issues.

238
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:03,800
But for one reason or another, they're not at the table.

239
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:14,360
And yeah, I mean, it's a tough one. It really is, because it's so much more difficult to think about who you left out than who you include.

240
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:21,440
And so it's it's got to be a lot. And sometimes it's about doing your homework to to, like, learn more.

241
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:29,750
I mean, I've even been in some groups where I've done a lot of homework about stuff and I'll ask them, Well, what about people who blah, blah, blah?

242
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:33,650
And they're like, Oh, we didn't think about that. And then we'll open discussions about it.

243
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:39,859
But you have to really dig deep because especially if you're work with people in community based organizations,

244
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:45,349
are so grounded in the work they're doing that they sometimes don't have the time,

245
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:49,910
energy perspective to think about those folks who may be accidentally left out.

246
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,350
But it's a really great question.

247
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:57,860
And I think it's something that, you know, I know in the work that I do, especially in global settings, we're always thinking about that.

248
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:00,710
It's like, who are we potentially leaving out?

249
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:08,930
And sometimes you actually have to leave out certain subpopulations if you don't have adequate resources and support.

250
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:16,730
Again, thinking back to like in HIV prevention, you know, there's been a debate over years about, well,

251
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:26,450
what about men who have sex with other men but don't have any ID as being gay or bi or any kind of, you know, same sex identities, orientations.

252
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:36,680
And there are those folks out there who are not going to come to anything that has LGBT or anything that's talking about sexuality explicitly.

253
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:42,439
And sometimes we have to make a conscious decision that this program isn't going to focus on them,

254
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,540
because that would be a whole other approach, you know.

255
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:54,380
So you'd have to really dig in to the the places where men who are having sex with other men that don't identify as being same sex attracted.

256
00:26:55,280 --> 00:27:00,030
You're going to have to do outreach a whole different way, and your intervention is going to have to look totally different, too.

257
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:09,200
So sometimes we do have to make the decision that we can't reach everyone at risk, but we're going to be able to reach the largest number.

258
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:13,820
Is that helpful? Okay. But yeah, it's an excellent, excellent question.

259
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:21,020
And it's it's it's hard in the real world, right? I mean, we can say these things in lectures and classes, but when you're really there,

260
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:24,170
it is really hard because you feel like, oh, we're doing this great.

261
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,690
You know, we're really engaging.

262
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:33,640
And sometimes you just have to take that step back and think about, I mean, a question I often ask people who won't walk through your door and.

263
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:37,899
That one question can be really effective because I'm like, Oh,

264
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:48,730
will someone who is an Arab or someone who I know with one organization I work with in Chicago because of gang lines?

265
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:55,330
We had to be really thoughtful about where we had different interventions because some people couldn't cross gang lines,

266
00:27:55,630 --> 00:28:01,240
and so we had to really think about how do we serve the whole community and still pay

267
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:06,460
attention to what it means to cross a gang line and where we could have neutral territory.

268
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:12,160
You know, and that's something a lot of times people don't think about unless you're really immersed in the community.

269
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:18,310
So you can have some it's like very culturally appropriate, but if you're not a part of that,

270
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:26,500
cultural awareness isn't tying in that gang culture, which is, is just part of some communities.

271
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:29,290
Then you're missing the boat. Yeah.

272
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:36,040
And I think one thing I would add to that I was thinking about as we were talking as well, is sometimes while working in communities,

273
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:45,670
especially how we were talking about, it's important to listen to them, to really engage with them, literally build that that sharing environment.

274
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:51,310
Also, sometimes that is like easier said than done because in my experience,

275
00:28:51,610 --> 00:29:00,909
I worked on a research project where we were we were collaborators as the research experts because we ran like studies on costume mental health.

276
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:09,900
We're working with United Negro College and they're they're running a cohort of campuses that are participating in the health mine study.

277
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:16,270
And so when we were developing their questions because they were adding specific questions for their students,

278
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:23,590
you know, they were really leaning on us to really guide. And I was like, you know, you all are really the experts of your own students, like,

279
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:32,260
and I'm really trying to like engage them in a way that's taking me out of being the expert and really placing it in their hands.

280
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:36,310
And sometimes that takes a lot more effort than just saying it.

281
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:43,480
Sometimes you have to, like, walk through activities because they're like, well, we've never done a research study, so we don't know.

282
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,340
And it's like, but you know, you're a student,

283
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:51,620
so you can really like speak to like their experiences and like the contract that we really need to focus on it.

284
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:55,780
So sometimes it takes like extra steps to get that interaction as well.

285
00:29:55,790 --> 00:30:03,970
So yes, any final I think that's that's really about all that I have any other thoughts on to make sure that you all are pretty quiet today.

286
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:08,020
So if you have more to say or any other thoughts that you want to share.

287
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:15,910
Okay. Great. So Mitt Romney's. You guys.

288
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,710
So given this caveat ahead of time because then the sugar would like.

289
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:27,389
So here's a bag of this. Friends and family, just in case you got some if you want there.

290
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:32,910
So help yourself. So did Akeelah do an amazing job last week, too?

291
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:36,530
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I figured they were more.

292
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:41,860
I know everyone's tired. It's not. We have a snowstorm.

293
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:46,170
There are parts of the state, you know, that's. I don't even know.

294
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:52,920
California is 70 degrees one day. And knowing that, I couldn't make for like.

295
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:56,820
So I have a couple of announcements.

296
00:30:57,210 --> 00:31:04,620
We're gonna we're going to switch up a couple of things for the rest of the semester just to, you know, have a little fun.

297
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:13,790
So with and I saw an announcement about it yesterday, but I'll say it in, you know, real world words, real world because I can speak those.

298
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:22,980
Um, so we have 18 groups this year, so we had a lot more people that did three person groups than for the group,

299
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:29,459
which last year we had a lot of four person groups and people asking for a bipartisan group, which we didn't really allow.

300
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:36,180
But anyway, so we're stretching. So the, the presentations occur on three days instead of two days.

301
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:41,820
And I put in, I change the guidelines a little bit. You have 10 to 12 minutes.

302
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:46,830
You don't have to do the full 12 minutes at 12 minutes.

303
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:54,690
I will like definitely kind of like pull you off the stage because we have to stop and I always feel rude,

304
00:31:54,690 --> 00:32:01,770
but I've been doing this long enough that I just have lost all emotion when it comes to stopping presentations.

305
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:08,490
So I apologize ahead of time. If I seem rude, I'll give you like a one minute warning if you want.

306
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:12,210
And then when the buzzer goes off, the buzzer goes off.

307
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,030
And I'm not doing that to be obnoxious.

308
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:20,489
Just I want to make sure everyone has the time because I've been in classes when I was a student before and they

309
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:25,440
didn't do that and you end up staying an extra hour and they make you come an extra day and all that crap.

310
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:32,429
We're not doing that. So because we're stretching it to three days,

311
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:37,380
I did knock out one class that was going to be on public health interventions because we've already done that.

312
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:41,280
I don't know what you were thinking when when that was in there.

313
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:50,580
So that was gone. And then because some people will be doing their feedback session right after Thanksgiving break,

314
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:57,030
which I always hate doing that because I get I hated it when people you know and strategies that what we're thinking about

315
00:32:57,030 --> 00:33:07,110
doing but we want to make this a collaborative process it is we're going to make Tuesday a day to just work with your group.

316
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:17,160
All right. Now we can also push it a step further and make that virtual so that you don't have to come

317
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:24,900
to the class and that you can do it virtually or you can come to class and do it here.

318
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:29,100
So does that sound okay? But did you do for Thanksgiving?

319
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:33,810
Tuesday is the Tuesday before because the presentations start the Tuesday after.

320
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:44,100
So that's why we wanted to give you like a whole class protected time to meet with your team instead of having to like stress over Thanksgiving break.

321
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:49,080
Is anyone opposed to that idea? All right.

322
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:55,830
Does anyone want to come in physically or do you want to keep it? Virtually, virtually?

323
00:33:56,010 --> 00:34:04,739
Of course I'll do it physically. You have to like are you being like attendance virtually or like yelling at all adults that you would meet in person,

324
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:13,080
but you will do whatever you want. You can meet at a coffee shop and you can meet outside and freeze your asses off.

325
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:22,980
Yeah. We just wanted to make sure that you had protected time, because I know that with groups, it's often hard if you have alternating schedules.

326
00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:26,940
So that's why we want it, because everyone has this hour and a half blocked off.

327
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:33,810
So we want to make sure that, you know, one can come back and say, oh, we didn't have a chance to get together because, yes, you did.

328
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:38,820
And we we gave you that hour and a half. And also, I'm good school.

329
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:46,709
So that means that this is the last like traditional luxury class and that while it seems like it if it's happened really

330
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:56,160
really bad so but we're ending on a high note with a few is inside and then I'm going to share some insights the last.

331
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:02,660
Oh, so just on the presentation things but not presentation feedback doesn't give you that presentation word.

332
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:06,210
Again, low stress, read the guidelines.

333
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:11,070
You don't have to go the whole 12 minutes. 10 minutes is beautiful.

334
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:17,570
You do need to send. If you're going to use PowerPoints, which most groups probably will,

335
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:29,150
you need to send those to Akeelah and to me by 9 a.m. on the day you are giving and receiving feedback.

336
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:36,400
I actually used a random sequence generator, which I didn't know those existed.

337
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:41,450
So to create the list of who goes when.

338
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:44,750
So you'll see it on the Google feed. So yeah.

339
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:50,960
So if you ever want to do that, just type in random sequence generator and it does it for you.

340
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:59,120
So if you have any view, if you're in a group and you just really like, Oh God, I can't do this day.

341
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:02,540
If you can find another group that will switch with you.

342
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,710
Just let us know and we'll switch out.

343
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:14,390
We don't want you going in the spreadsheet and changing it yourself, but you're welcome to swap with a group in both groups set to the swap.

344
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:20,060
Any questions on that? Yes.

345
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:23,780
All of this all affect the critical reflection journals.

346
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:37,099
So the journal entries will stay the same. Yeah. So there's the last one is next week, on Tuesday, that's 19 because we kicked out one entry.

347
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:40,760
So you'll still do that even though you're not here.

348
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:48,230
Any other questions? Good questions. Do you want to make sure to bring your journal?

349
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:54,770
Yeah. All right.

350
00:36:55,070 --> 00:37:04,620
So all in all alternates there.

351
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:09,260
But I think and I think it was like it's not so it was selected.

352
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,950
I don't know where it went to write it down.

353
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:20,450
I think I might actually come out of Illinois and I was like, because I have a week ago.

354
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:35,420
Everyone is super quiet now. Let's find out what the rest of that idea and that's always like.

355
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:41,200
Do you have your attention, please?

356
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:49,480
And so my last quote for the semester by Martin Luther King Jr and the end.

357
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:53,750
We will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends.

358
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:58,480
What do you think that means? Yes.

359
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:04,479
It's been talked about a lot,

360
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:19,900
but does doesn't mean that inaction is worse than inaction to prevent negative action is worse than the negative actions itself.

361
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:33,909
Right. Gentlemen, I have a question. Like, do you think performative activism is worse than, like, not saying I mean, I thought really?

362
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:41,260
Excellent point. And that's a that's a point. Personally, I think the performative action is worse.

363
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:50,980
Well, I had a brick where I'm. It depends on is that what level of performativity it is.

364
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:55,600
I mean, I think because sometimes what happens with performative action is it blocks true actions.

365
00:38:56,170 --> 00:39:00,999
So in those cases, I would say definitely less yes and played with pictures action.

366
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,060
A lot of times I don't think they're part of the problem. Right, exactly.

367
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:07,530
If I like repost this graphic on my story, like, I would understand.

368
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:17,410
Yeah. And it's really much more like is like self serving, you know, and it's to feed their ego and to feel like, oh yeah, I get something.

369
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:25,959
Yeah. But, and I think that also some sort of action to send leave people into,

370
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:32,920
falsely bully others believing that action is being taken and something like, oh well I don't need to do anything because this is happening.

371
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:44,530
Yeah. So I do think that, I think it's really scary and I think in the main in the academy, there's a lot of performative action that goes on.

372
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:53,560
You know, I'm sure you've all gone to different day workshops and things like that, some of which are, you know, kind of useless.

373
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,720
I actually went to one that was really good.

374
00:39:57,310 --> 00:40:10,030
It was one on University of Michigan's history of anti-Blackness, and it was this center for research on learning and teaching CRT players.

375
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:21,910
And so they talked about like the whole history of ways in which the University of Michigan has oppressed and marginalized black folks.

376
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:29,770
So it was really, really interesting, and they did it in a really kind of affective way, too.

377
00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:38,160
So it was something that elicited emotion. It wasn't just talking, but they did these little plays and scenarios and had people react to.

378
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:52,670
Did you have more ideas about that now, I guess, than college or in some circumstances worse than staying silent.

379
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:56,490
But it's not going to stay silent, right?

380
00:40:57,170 --> 00:41:03,340
Yeah. I mean, yeah. Go about preventing that.

381
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:06,480
These are excellent questions and I'm not sure I have all the answers.

382
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:13,960
I mean, I would I guess, again, personally, I can't say that, you know, I don't know the data or research on it, but I think the.

383
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:23,590
I mean, it depends on how you define performative. So, you know, it's because some actions can be like small actions.

384
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:29,110
So if you just, like, talk with someone about an issue and you start having dialog and discussion.

385
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:33,430
I think that is an action that can have an impact.

386
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:40,750
I think when I think of performance, I think of like the big showy things like posting something or saying,

387
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:45,850
Oh, I'm doing, you know, we're going to eradicate racism with a two hour workshop.

388
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:51,320
So that's kind of what I what I'm thinking about. You have other thoughts on what?

389
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:55,150
What about other people? No, I think that's an excellent question.

390
00:41:55,420 --> 00:42:00,700
And we're definitely in that even day of a lot of performative socially and social media.

391
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:08,140
I'm through with I guess I oversee those things, but like, oh, like I can tell you get the story if you don't like due process.

392
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:12,040
I read everything. So like what are your thoughts on that?

393
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:22,090
And like, I don't know, like how I feel like I see that more people are like, Oh yeah, well that's why I don't do social media.

394
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:31,120
But yeah. So what's the phenomenon of someone saying that you saw something like, oh, like I could see it's like a story and you don't everyone.

395
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:36,760
And if you don't pose that, you don't support. Yeah, like that is kind of a hot mess.

396
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:51,759
Akeelah, what do you think? I mean, I get I mean, my initial reaction would be that you need to well, paragraph isn't even how like.

397
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:52,840
But there's this film.

398
00:42:52,930 --> 00:43:03,130
I mean, and in some ways, though, that's become the normative behavior that you have to react in order for people to not see you as negative.

399
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:13,569
If we feed into that, then we're just reinforcing that because I think that it's perfectly fine to read something and just be reflective.

400
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:20,800
I mean, that could be action too is just a greater awareness and then going and talking to your friends about it,

401
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:26,469
and that doesn't appear on social media. So yeah, I guess I'm against this.

402
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:31,780
I'm not on social media. I don't have great insight what other people think.

403
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:37,080
But that is kind of that is kind of weird, right? Because then it's like almost, oh, oh again.

404
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:44,350
It's almost like them. They're forcing you in some way to do that, you know, then you're seeing as negative.

405
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:58,150
Yeah, you're right. That's the lesson. Yeah, I mean, I think so.

406
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:31,480
Yeah. So I feel like I see like as it's like, you know, it's kind of becoming something here and yeah,

407
00:44:31,690 --> 00:44:40,330
well their connection to whatever the phenomenon our experience is. Yeah, I was really well, I thought it's a very nuanced topic.

408
00:44:44,290 --> 00:45:12,520
He. Stories like this might feel like a very subjective reason.

409
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:16,410
And everyone is like, Oh, everything costs. Like they're going to.

410
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:27,570
This wasn't the case. There is no evidence of that.

411
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:36,190
So here's how I was thinking.

412
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:48,240
You know, I was like, I had to, like, tell you because it's not like you're not solving it right now.

413
00:45:48,450 --> 00:46:02,820
No. Security is so detrimental. And I think, like, it's so hard to like I think this is also a lot of what used to be almost like malfeasance.

414
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:07,030
Really. Like it's like. Right?

415
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:13,810
That's right.

416
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:20,170
There's a point, I think, too, with, you know, people who may be influencers.

417
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:24,220
I know that I've actually got, um.

418
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:32,160
Yeah, I was waiting for it to have, like, a a influencing behavior, but, um.

419
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:36,380
But, I mean, you're right. What is the intention behind it?

420
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:42,790
Like, why are you doing that? You know, and, like, companies that do that would be like, oh, yeah, so we're going to donate so much.

421
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:50,900
But if you like, they're probably saving a lot of money and advertising costs by doing that, you know,

422
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:59,410
so they don't if they donate even like $100,000, they probably would spend very easily that much on an advertising campaign.

423
00:46:59,770 --> 00:47:04,690
And so they've just got free advertisements. Yeah. Yeah. That was when you asked me what my thoughts were.

424
00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:11,079
My immediate thought was kind of related to what you're just saying is that I think when it comes to social justice,

425
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:14,350
like I think that we live in a day and age,

426
00:47:14,350 --> 00:47:23,270
that information sharing is critical and it's important, but I don't think it's as important as like money and action and like actively doing things.

427
00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:31,929
So I, I definitely think that like taking performative measures isn't helpful almost at all,

428
00:47:31,930 --> 00:47:35,650
except for the only value I think it brings is sharing information.

429
00:47:36,010 --> 00:47:40,420
And it's really up to the person to read it and engage with it and understand it.

430
00:47:40,690 --> 00:47:45,100
So like you could share something and someone could just like tap, tap, tap and never actually see what you're sharing.

431
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:53,800
And so I don't I think that it's really the fact it's more important maybe to like actually do something or give something or donate time,

432
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:58,240
energy, money or other resources or. Yeah.

433
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:06,790
I think during the time, you know, when Martin Luther King wrote that obvious that we didn't have social media.

434
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:14,050
And so I think the silence was really less about not saying anything and more about action.

435
00:48:14,290 --> 00:48:22,030
Yeah, I'd just like to kind of feedback like I think like with those, like, um,

436
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:32,200
like read, post them more so to not be the person to like actually do things.

437
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:37,880
I feel like that's like the biggest issue but like it's there so that people

438
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:44,760
reading that that's not really do people are kind of just they're not like I,

439
00:48:45,950 --> 00:48:49,120
I feel like it's just like now I feel like that happens.

440
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:54,180
Like every time there's like a public health issue, there's always like something like those things,

441
00:48:54,190 --> 00:48:58,210
like if you like and if you don't, you're like, you're about to fight.

442
00:48:58,630 --> 00:49:07,630
Like, I don't know how difficult and stop people from doing that because I'm sure there are like a few people who are actually trying to learn,

443
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:16,230
but I think the vast majority of people are kind of just doing it to like be performative it to just not be like the person can do those things,

444
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:20,319
right. Yeah. That is not I mean, it's yeah.

445
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:21,730
I mean I'm learning something today.

446
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:28,150
I don't know about the full guilt trip thing if you don't do that again, just reinforcing why I'm so glad I'm not on social media.

447
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:35,140
But yeah, I mean it does how like I mean there really needs to be a culture shock too, because I mean, that's like such a waste of energy.

448
00:49:35,410 --> 00:49:40,110
If you feel like, you know, if you're dealing, if you're trying to deal with like not feeling guilty,

449
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:43,150
you can't put the energy into actually making social change.

450
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:48,160
Right? Because it's like, oh, wait, I have to keep up with what everyone else is saying about that.

451
00:49:48,670 --> 00:49:57,549
I think another thing that this quote reminds me of is like a lot of very venues like where you are like NASCAR teams,

452
00:49:57,550 --> 00:50:07,300
their bio or they call it their pride month and then they'll take in a lot of portraits and then they won't have

453
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:16,260
anything on the actual product or their what has to be shown that like stuff like like how Oriol makes like.

454
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:22,730
Rainbow colored Oreos. There's nothing but showing that those proceeds are going right.

455
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:28,610
Exactly. And so, in a way, it's just become like another market to make money.

456
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:35,270
Yeah, I do think that's like extremely harmful as well.

457
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:39,350
Yeah. I mean, that's like total capitalism.

458
00:50:39,350 --> 00:50:51,790
Consumerism is like taking actions that should be celebrated already and and making things visible and just like tapping on top.

459
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:59,629
Mean, I remember back in the old days when, you know, the first company started doing that for pride.

460
00:50:59,630 --> 00:51:05,510
At first, you know, a lot of us in the community were like, Yeah, but then we're like, Oh, no, they're just making money off of us, you know?

461
00:51:05,510 --> 00:51:11,870
Because they're like, I think certainly alcohol companies are all on board and it's like, Let's get the game strong.

462
00:51:12,830 --> 00:51:19,310
So we're just kind of like, put rainbows all over Z and then, you know, screws brides over.

463
00:51:19,550 --> 00:51:23,960
That's it's off the shelf. I mean, they go in the stores and I think they just like burn it.

464
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:27,920
So there news and it's nowhere to be found.

465
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:38,420
They'll try this next year after pride month, try and find the alcoholic beverages with the rainbow flag and they will be gone, mark my words.

466
00:51:38,810 --> 00:51:43,990
But yeah, that's a related component. Who else wants to be able to do okay for me?

467
00:51:44,210 --> 00:51:48,970
Yeah. Yeah. We're actually talking about this topic at work yesterday.

468
00:51:49,010 --> 00:51:54,560
We did like an activity where we had like six or seven prompts, all the it's like social justice.

469
00:51:54,920 --> 00:52:01,700
And one of the prompts is like to like this either is like one of those type activities where you go to the site and yeah.

470
00:52:02,210 --> 00:52:07,010
And one of them was like, oh, like there's one way to do social justice and there's multiple ways.

471
00:52:07,010 --> 00:52:09,440
And so everyone all went to that site is in multiple ways.

472
00:52:09,650 --> 00:52:15,470
And the one following that was like, there's wrong ways to do social justice and there's no wrong ways.

473
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:19,460
And so all of us in our group went to like the wrong way through social justice.

474
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:25,160
And I brought up like an example of that when in 2020,

475
00:52:25,170 --> 00:52:33,380
people were posting black squares and really thought that they were they really thought they were imposing black squares.

476
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:40,790
Oh, yeah, I support Black Lives Matter, but that was it to me. At least that was a harm that like did more harm to the proper form of action.

477
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:47,990
I mean, activism is not like, oh, work, it's not good. But I think it can have real, like harmful effects because it was a form of silencing.

478
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:54,410
Yeah. That people were posting information was actually helpful way for people to get to take.

479
00:52:54,680 --> 00:53:00,050
And like, um, another thing like with the social media sites, like, I don't have social media sites,

480
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:06,550
I deleted mine in May 2020 because people are posting Ahmaud Arbery death and like, oh yeah, like people need to see this.

481
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:08,270
I don't know, not like that's a harmful way.

482
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:14,000
And like I was literally just saying that I was like, if you want to go to cleanse, like I've never looked back, it's so much better.

483
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:20,410
But like I said, that it took that instant and like just repetitive that people were like, Oh yeah, like, this is good.

484
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:21,950
Like people are saying and not really.

485
00:53:21,950 --> 00:53:28,399
People don't think where they post, they literally just click, click and like assume that it's all fine because other people are doing it.

486
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:35,930
And I feel like it's that like collective, like, like people kind of just bandwagon and I feel like that's like the ease of social media kind of.

487
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:43,459
You don't really have to think because since everyone else is doing that. So, you know, these journals really helping you get critical reflections.

488
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:50,900
But I just think it goes to show how like performative activism, like forms of social justice can have real, like harmful ramifications.

489
00:53:50,970 --> 00:53:54,680
My coworker was like, not only did like the Black Square silence people,

490
00:53:54,680 --> 00:54:02,419
but it reduced all of the like black lives that were killed to a rank as well as all the emotions, all the experiences.

491
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:06,690
It's just now one Instagram tile that was there for a day or two, you know?

492
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:13,819
Yeah. No, I like what you said because I mean, I definitely had this conversation around kind of LGBT activism is that some people are like,

493
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:20,870
do you slap a rainbow flag on something? And then you say, you know, you're you're supporting or store.

494
00:54:20,870 --> 00:54:26,210
And I appreciate some stores that will put like a rainbow flag on the door to show that they're friendly.

495
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:31,700
But then you go in and they're not friendly at all because it's all about, again, consumerism.

496
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:37,130
But I like what you said about reducing the whole group to an icon or an image or a color,

497
00:54:37,490 --> 00:54:42,080
you know, and that is damaging because then people are like, Oh, well, I can make money off this.

498
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:45,500
Or if I do this, people are going to think, you know, I'm cool.

499
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:52,999
But really what we should be doing is thinking about, well, you know, give us information about how to support black owned businesses,

500
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:57,930
give us information about how to support, you know, job opportunities or other things like that.

501
00:54:57,950 --> 00:55:04,820
Yeah, it's something it makes me think about that. So I think there's either speculation or duels.

502
00:55:04,850 --> 00:55:15,340
It's always going to perform at the World Cup. And supposedly she pulled out because of some controversy around, um, LGBT rights there.

503
00:55:15,410 --> 00:55:18,190
Mm hmm. But. Just kind of frustrating because it's like,

504
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:27,200
how are you going to pull out of there with places like France and like Western countries have like receptions.

505
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:32,140
Literally, you can see people and even not just got like France.

506
00:55:32,190 --> 00:55:37,810
Like all the different Islamaphobia or like so on, so forth.

507
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:45,590
So it's just because it's like people are like it's just like you just exist.

508
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:49,210
And it's like when one person does something, it's fun and another group does.

509
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:51,890
It's not acceptable. Yeah.

510
00:55:51,940 --> 00:56:00,160
I think, you know, with people who have who are, you know, famous in one way or another, I think that I have to deal with that either.

511
00:56:00,970 --> 00:56:03,220
Social media, no fame, is it?

512
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:10,260
There is a lot of pressure that like if you make a statement, that statement speaks much louder, unfortunately, than a lot of other statements.

513
00:56:10,270 --> 00:56:12,970
You know, and I do appreciate it.

514
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:18,820
You know, sometimes when people that are in the public's eye will make a statement, but it's like if someone like, for instance,

515
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:24,010
if they're like pulling out of something and then there's like hints that, you know, this is or that I didn't do [INAUDIBLE].

516
00:56:24,310 --> 00:56:30,020
Right. So if you want to, like, speak up and have a statement about this is my decision,

517
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:36,190
these are the reasons for my decision, then you're educating people and people can make informed choices.

518
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:45,550
But I think sometimes when stars are just doing things for a headline or, you know, other crap like that, it doesn't really do a whole lot.

519
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:51,370
Yeah. Yeah. I can't talk about that when it comes to, um, I think like influencers, like we're talking about like social media influencers.

520
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:56,170
I think the really interesting thing is that a lot of times like their fans or like people online would be like,

521
00:56:56,170 --> 00:57:00,100
oh, like, you know, you have this base, why aren't you using it? Like, why aren't you talking about it?

522
00:57:00,310 --> 00:57:03,870
And in a way, like, yeah, like why don't you spread resources like while on this page?

523
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:10,000
Also, some people are like 15, 16, 17, like there's only so much that they fully understand about social justice.

524
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:16,180
And so, like, I feel like they need the time to kind of like read and learn about it and like be more immersive until they can,

525
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:19,060
like, actually say something and then get judged for it. Right?

526
00:57:19,150 --> 00:57:22,330
Because they don't fully understand, like what they're saying, what they're talking about.

527
00:57:22,330 --> 00:57:26,770
Like they're only so young. Yeah. It's also interesting that like like.

528
00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:33,969
Yeah, and that's a really good point. That's the same thing with, you know, like a lot of athletes who rise to stardom really fast and, you know,

529
00:57:33,970 --> 00:57:37,660
they're they're put in these pressure points to like do that and say this dude, you know,

530
00:57:37,870 --> 00:57:42,310
without any kind of, like, support, mentoring, nurturing, growth, things like that.

531
00:57:42,370 --> 00:57:49,059
Yeah, you know, stuff that point. Like, I think it's like really, really important to kind of like, see,

532
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:54,380
like what kind of information like you're spreading within this context because like when I see like, like my experience,

533
00:57:54,460 --> 00:58:00,190
like when I was in high school, I went to this like out of the school and this guy was like, really like,

534
00:58:00,550 --> 00:58:04,930
like he was like a big activist in the area and tons of, like followers, like thousands almost.

535
00:58:04,930 --> 00:58:08,920
And then I would talk to him at school and talk about like certain issues.

536
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:15,670
And then like one day, like, I see that he's posted about something that's from like my, my like hometown, like in India and like,

537
00:58:15,670 --> 00:58:21,040
my, my family's like, involved in it because it's like, it's like from back home, like we still have, like, have our family there.

538
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:22,120
Like, we know what's going on.

539
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:27,370
But then, like, I'm like looking at like what he's saying and he's saying it for like fact of like the state judgment almost.

540
00:58:27,370 --> 00:58:32,650
But like, it's like it's like almost like misinformation. And it's like stuff that you're hearing from, like, a single news source.

541
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:36,290
Yeah. Like, already has its biases, like within, like, comedians coming out.

542
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:41,380
And so like when I, when I saw that, I was like, this doesn't seem right. And so that let's nip media for a bit.

543
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:47,620
But then like I would get like a bunch of people who would like to like text me about it and then like ask for, like,

544
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:53,679
for like my family's like stances on like the subject was they want to see, like if my family's public good or like the bad side,

545
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:59,200
even though like it's like a lot more complicated that and it's like maybe he was

546
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:04,610
like like it was almost like he was spreading misinformation almost and like it,

547
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:12,960
but like in the end, like it was targeting people of the community who were then you then became spokespeople for like like.

548
00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:18,129
Yeah, just like seeing like racism. Yeah. Yeah. I think that, you know, again,

549
00:59:18,130 --> 00:59:23,650
going back to like the performative thing and some of the especially social media is I think

550
00:59:23,650 --> 00:59:29,770
the danger in all this too is the how easy discourse and misinformation can be spread,

551
00:59:30,130 --> 00:59:37,190
you know. And yeah, I'm sure a lot of used and I've seen that all too many times where, you know,

552
00:59:37,660 --> 00:59:44,410
word gets out about some issue and it only has one spin from one perspective.

553
00:59:44,740 --> 00:59:53,020
And then people, if you repost that, you're saying I support what they say without doing your homework to find out if that really is the issue.

554
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:59,170
Yeah. And also like to build off of that from like you were just I think like something that

555
00:59:59,170 --> 01:00:06,070
I was like working out like in a lab looking at like pretty much anything in my town,

556
01:00:06,790 --> 01:00:12,720
like the institutions that we. Alison, thank you and critical thinking.

557
01:00:13,790 --> 01:00:21,559
And I think that like having these institutions teach us about how to be the way we're supposed to think and,

558
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:25,430
like, acknowledge and, like, there's a lot of times like.

559
01:00:27,450 --> 01:00:36,209
I'm really, like, salivating because I'm using, like, false negatives and not really thinking about these sources, reliable, credible and etc.

560
01:00:36,210 --> 01:00:42,390
And I think that. That really just ties to like how social activism nowadays is just becoming

561
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:46,140
so skewed in the sense that like we're just going to whatever anybody says.

562
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:55,500
And that's even like true people have this explosive and like understanding of their perspective on issues.

563
01:00:55,830 --> 01:00:58,680
And at the same time, they're not fully realizing the like, I guess,

564
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:08,160
like the reflection of like whether or not there's other perspectives on social issue and things like that have to do with consciousness.

565
01:01:08,430 --> 01:01:10,770
Right, exactly. Yeah, that's a really good point.

566
01:01:10,780 --> 01:01:21,569
I think, you know, it makes me think we we need to have a mandatory class and every university either how to judge sources,

567
01:01:21,570 --> 01:01:28,649
you know, how to evaluate that judge. You know, how do we know what's credible, reliable, ethical, all those other things?

568
01:01:28,650 --> 01:01:33,930
Because yeah, you're absolutely right. And and often these issues like you're talking to are much more complex.

569
01:01:33,930 --> 01:01:36,809
It's not black or white. It's not good or bad, you know.

570
01:01:36,810 --> 01:01:43,080
And if we don't critically analyze those and critique them and do our own work and I can imagine if it's social media,

571
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:51,820
you're really pushed to respond right away, then that prohibits you from engaging in that analytic process that, you know,

572
01:01:51,870 --> 01:01:59,100
you really need to do if you're going to have a, I think, a true, ah, good sense of what it's about.

573
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:07,860
Yeah. One thing I just noticed on CNN today while the classroom was over is that there's some legislation going on right

574
01:02:07,860 --> 01:02:17,399
now that is protecting definitions of marriage and so impactful gay marriage and then interracial marriage,

575
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:25,560
because interracial marriage was was outlawed and the reporter was reporting it as a legislation is about gay interracial marriage.

576
01:02:26,230 --> 01:02:34,360
That's like really if you read what was about but it was yeah, I was just kind of blown away.

577
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:42,730
I was on CNN and I'm like, Really? And even the trailer thing at the bottom said, you know, legislation protecting gay interracial marriage.

578
01:02:42,750 --> 01:02:47,640
And I mean, you know, someone in a gay interracial marriage, I'm like, yeah, I'm finally visible.

579
01:02:48,090 --> 01:02:51,690
Fine. But you're bummed out because it's not with the legislation.

580
01:02:52,020 --> 01:03:00,499
So it was a little depressing. So in the short time we have left and actually I don't want people to think that we're like short sighted

581
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:06,000
in social justice because social justice has been interwoven throughout everything that we when we say,

582
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:12,870
I do want to show you this video. What is it?

583
01:03:20,340 --> 01:03:29,160
Well, maybe we've only seen the short video. It's just taken off there.

584
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:38,690
I'll never be home in the US panels. The reason is not about sunlight or leather or even quality.

585
01:03:39,530 --> 01:03:44,030
Try this agreement party. Ask your guests to define the term social justice.

586
01:03:44,550 --> 01:03:51,170
I'm not sure whether, but it should generate some interesting conversation, especially if your guests are on the political left.

587
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:58,580
Since everyone on that side of the spectrum talks sensibly about social justice, they should be able to provide a good definition.

588
01:03:58,580 --> 01:04:02,990
Right? But ask liberals to tell you what they mean by something like this.

589
01:04:03,230 --> 01:04:09,139
You'll get ten different answers. That's because social justice means anything.

590
01:04:09,140 --> 01:04:13,580
It's champions want it to be almost without exception.

591
01:04:13,820 --> 01:04:16,310
Labor unions, universities and colleges,

592
01:04:16,550 --> 01:04:25,160
private foundations and public charities claim at least part of their mission to be the spreading of social justice far and wide.

593
01:04:26,540 --> 01:04:32,780
Here's the mission statement of the AFL-CIO. But it could be the mission statement for a thousand such organizations.

594
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:39,470
Both the mission of the AFL-CIO is to improve the lives of working families,

595
01:04:39,950 --> 01:04:44,810
to bring economic justice to the workplace and social justice to our nation.

596
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:49,670
In short, social justice is code for good things.

597
01:04:49,850 --> 01:04:57,049
No one needs to argue for and no one dare be against this very much trouble.

598
01:04:57,050 --> 01:05:04,130
The great economist Friedrich Pi. This is what he wrote in 1976, two years after winning the Nobel Prize in Economics,

599
01:05:05,660 --> 01:05:11,959
I am going to feel strongly that the greatest service I can still render to my fellow men would be that I could

600
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:19,340
make the speakers and writers among them thoroughly a gene ever again to employ the term social justice.

601
01:05:20,510 --> 01:05:23,089
Why was it so sad? So women are okay.

602
01:05:23,090 --> 01:05:31,760
This is a massive and certainly unobjectionable term because higher as he so often do so right is the core of the issue.

603
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:40,790
And what he saw frightened him. I understood that beneath the political opportunism and intellectual laziness of the term,

604
01:05:40,790 --> 01:05:49,490
social justice was a pernicious philosophical claim, namely that freedom must be sacrificed in order to redistribute income.

605
01:05:50,540 --> 01:05:58,700
Ultimately, social justice is about the state amassing ever increasing power in order to do good things.

606
01:05:59,630 --> 01:06:04,760
What are good things? Well, whatever the champions of social justice decide this.

607
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:08,330
We come first, last and always.

608
01:06:08,690 --> 01:06:14,150
It is the cause of economic redistribution according to the doctrine of social justice.

609
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:19,930
I have always had too much. The have nots never have enough.

610
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:29,540
You don't have to take my word for it. That is precisely how a U.N. report on social justice defines the term for social justice may be

611
01:06:29,540 --> 01:06:35,930
broadly understood as the fair and compassionate distribution of the fruits of economic growth.

612
01:06:37,060 --> 01:06:45,970
Social justice is not possible without strong and coherent redistributive policies conceived and implemented by public agencies.

613
01:06:46,780 --> 01:06:56,110
And I repeat them strong and coherent redistributive policies conceived and implemented by public agencies and against worse.

614
01:06:56,710 --> 01:07:04,570
The report goes on to exist in, quote, Present day believers in absolute truth, identify with virtue and justice,

615
01:07:05,020 --> 01:07:10,600
are neither willing nor desirable companions for the defenders of social justice.

616
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:20,140
Translation If you believe truth and justice are concepts independent of the agenda of the forces of progress as defined by the Left,

617
01:07:20,710 --> 01:07:29,710
you are an enemy of social justice. Compassion for social justice is when government takes your money and gives it to someone else.

618
01:07:30,310 --> 01:07:38,860
Read you one single underline point of social justice that amounts to a sweeping indictment of a free society.

619
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:48,910
It suggests that any perceived unfairness or sorrow or economic warmth must be addressed by yet another government effort to remedy that unfairness,

620
01:07:48,910 --> 01:07:58,000
that sorrow, or that economic one. All we need to do is invoke the abracadabra phrase social justice, and we're on our way.

621
01:07:58,690 --> 01:08:04,090
The invocation of social justice always works from the assumption that the right people,

622
01:08:04,390 --> 01:08:10,570
the anointed few, can simply impose fairness, prosperity, and any other good thing you can think of.

623
01:08:11,530 --> 01:08:15,970
And the only institution capable of imposing social justice is the state.

624
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:24,430
And keep in mind, the conventional wisdom among liberal leads is that conservatives are the ones who want to impose their values on everyone else.

625
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:32,410
The self-declared champions of social justice believe the state must remedy and can remedy all perceived wrongs.

626
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:41,530
Anyone who disagrees is an enemy of what is good and right, and the state must therefore coerce them to do what is socially justice.

627
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:46,210
And that as high prophesized, is no longer a free society.

628
01:08:47,020 --> 01:08:54,100
Is that the kind of society you want to live in? If it isn't, beware what will be done in the name of social justice.

629
01:08:54,940 --> 01:09:01,940
I'm Jonah Goldberg at the American Enterprise Institute and National Review, members of the Reagan administration.

630
01:09:02,170 --> 01:09:07,250
Subscribe to our YouTube channel for free reading.

631
01:09:09,130 --> 01:09:15,250
So what do you think about that? I got 10 minutes to reply.

632
01:09:16,210 --> 01:09:24,040
What are your what are your thoughts on that? And this is you know, this is out there quite a bit, this kind of type of rhetoric.

633
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:31,929
So that's why I like to end on this, to show you that although we often have shared kind of beliefs,

634
01:09:31,930 --> 01:09:40,270
that we are sometimes in the minority, let's say my grandmother sent me this video and I'm so sorry.

635
01:09:40,270 --> 01:09:45,339
I'm glad you made it here. But yeah, it's like, I don't know.

636
01:09:45,340 --> 01:09:49,630
It's interesting to see how they kind of view those like the terms,

637
01:09:50,350 --> 01:09:56,590
just kind of everything about this and how they kind of see this like a negative kind of thing.

638
01:09:56,890 --> 01:10:06,250
Yeah. And their reactions. Yeah, I saw like, they, like, never trust somebody who cites an economist that went to the University of Chicago.

639
01:10:08,230 --> 01:10:12,850
But yeah, no, I just wow.

640
01:10:13,210 --> 01:10:20,710
Like my this also reminds me like my instructor for an indigenous activism course.

641
01:10:20,710 --> 01:10:30,820
I took also like told us to watch like a Prager U video about like economics and stuff and just like it's so interesting how they take,

642
01:10:30,820 --> 01:10:36,950
like, redistributive policies so that everybody can benefit from, like, economic growth as like labor,

643
01:10:37,030 --> 01:10:43,959
the government coming in to take your money and hand it to somebody else when it's like in like in the U.S. and in so many countries,

644
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:48,940
like people cannot benefit from like the fruits of their labor because like there's

645
01:10:48,940 --> 01:10:52,839
like a capitalist like overlord who is like taking the majority of the money,

646
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:55,180
like you're not getting like the actual value of your labor.

647
01:10:55,570 --> 01:11:01,530
But yeah, they love to reduce it down to taking your money and giving it to other people, right?

648
01:11:01,870 --> 01:11:09,549
Yeah. Not even recognizing that the reason why some people can make more money is because of racism, sexism, xenophobia.

649
01:11:09,550 --> 01:11:14,110
I mean, all these other factors, other thoughts or feelings and.

650
01:11:15,250 --> 01:11:18,450
Well, one thing is I really I wish they got a new graphic designer I didn't enjoy.

651
01:11:19,060 --> 01:11:20,920
But secondly,

652
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:28,239
I think it's funny that he he really you have to like the state and like the government is the one who's like the agent of social justice.

653
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:35,560
And I just find it funny. So many like NGOs and nonprofits and community organizations like I would say do more work.

654
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:41,200
The government. Yeah. Like economic redistribution, like usual.

655
01:11:41,330 --> 01:11:45,500
Like, just I feel like it was, like, very focused. Like, you don't like taxes.

656
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:50,090
We get it, like, right? Not. But I don't. I just found that it was, like, very hyper focused on that.

657
01:11:50,210 --> 01:11:58,420
Yeah, well, it's very political. I mean, he's not really talking about social justice in a broad, you know, kind of way.

658
01:11:58,430 --> 01:12:03,499
Yeah. Do doing as you say when he was like if you ask someone about social justice and you get ten different

659
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:07,080
answers and you put a bunch of things up there like workers rights and gay rights in college,

660
01:12:07,310 --> 01:12:09,660
I was like, That's so funny that you think those are ten different answers.

661
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:15,079
And I feel like we all know that something's connected and it's just it's just marginalized people getting rights and that.

662
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:18,410
Right. That's one concern. Yeah, exactly. There's just a lot of promise.

663
01:12:19,190 --> 01:12:26,030
So. Yeah, I mean, I mean, I just think that the one kind of valid point that you raised is that like.

664
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:26,809
Yeah.

665
01:12:26,810 --> 01:12:33,590
Like if you ask people what social justice is and you get ten different answers, like what actually gets done is in the hands of the people in power.

666
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:39,530
Right. And so I think that's interesting because like, we could probably agree with him on that and the sense of that's why social

667
01:12:39,530 --> 01:12:43,669
justice isn't happening because like there are a bunch of issues out there,

668
01:12:43,670 --> 01:12:48,620
but like really it's in the hands of the people that are making those decisions and have the money.

669
01:12:48,620 --> 01:12:54,620
And so. Yeah, I don't know. I thought aside from everything else that's like that to me is like, okay.

670
01:12:55,490 --> 01:13:02,780
Yeah. And, and one reason I like to show this is because. Yeah, I agree with them too, in the sense that not everyone defines it in the same way.

671
01:13:03,950 --> 01:13:10,790
And, and another reason why I like to show it is for you all to be thinking about how do you define social justice?

672
01:13:11,060 --> 01:13:16,520
And there really isn't just one way to define it. I mean, there's reading ins, hopefully that you read that, talk about it.

673
01:13:16,820 --> 01:13:23,180
And I was going to talk about in the lecture, but I mean, basically it's just there's so many different ways to conceptualize it.

674
01:13:23,180 --> 01:13:30,709
And I think that we have to come you have to come up with your own personal definition, right, and see how you're going to enact social justice.

675
01:13:30,710 --> 01:13:38,630
Because really, social justice is at the core of all of public health, because it's about the community's health and the community is good.

676
01:13:38,900 --> 01:13:43,730
And so it's about making, you know, the social environment, unjust environment.

677
01:13:43,910 --> 01:13:48,170
So it's at the core of what we do and we talk around it and we talk about it,

678
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:55,250
but there's really no one globally accepted, you know, definition that we all can agree upon in public.

679
01:13:55,430 --> 01:13:59,750
Yeah, yeah. I think there's so many definitions because these are personal.

680
01:14:00,130 --> 01:14:03,930
Yes. Social justice means something different to each person.

681
01:14:04,850 --> 01:14:07,740
Yeah. And I think that I can't either. Okay.

682
01:14:07,940 --> 01:14:18,530
I think I would really encourage all of you to really think about what is your definition of social justice and how could you define it differently,

683
01:14:18,530 --> 01:14:27,120
prohibit progress, and how can it also then be used to join together and to lead to more progress?

684
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:33,109
Yeah, I also found it interesting that he was talking about basically he reduced it

685
01:14:33,110 --> 01:14:36,980
down like social justice being something that the state or the government.

686
01:14:37,030 --> 01:14:45,349
Right. And I just felt like that really discounted actual social justice looks like is the people like doing the work for themselves.

687
01:14:45,350 --> 01:14:48,950
And I think that only because especially when you look at, you know,

688
01:14:48,980 --> 01:14:57,440
the 1900s and all of the progress that was made in that century, some things do have to be done legally and government.

689
01:14:58,040 --> 01:15:03,589
There's like like voting rights, for example. Like that would not have happened without federal legislation.

690
01:15:03,590 --> 01:15:08,330
Right. But that did not happen like that act in itself of passing that law.

691
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:12,950
Was it the social justice? Right. It was all of the action that happened prior.

692
01:15:12,950 --> 01:15:20,389
So I think that I found that really interesting. It is really like reducing it down to just like fighting on a piece of paper or like signing a law.

693
01:15:20,390 --> 01:15:25,830
But it's much more than that. Yeah, that's an excellent point that if you really look at, you know,

694
01:15:25,940 --> 01:15:35,150
most movements or even like public health policy interventions as a result of like seatbelt laws and,

695
01:15:35,450 --> 01:15:38,630
you know, nonsmoking places, those all started with activists.

696
01:15:39,220 --> 01:15:45,470
And it it wasn't like a bunch of politicians sat around and said, oh, yeah, let's make it illegal to not wear your seatbelt.

697
01:15:45,470 --> 01:15:54,500
It was because a lot of times mothers who lost children to drunk drivers and they were the ones that started the activism.

698
01:15:54,830 --> 01:15:55,889
So you're absolutely right.

699
01:15:55,890 --> 01:16:03,710
And it's it's not it's ignoring that all these things start at the grassroots level, but they become codified at the legal level.

700
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:07,820
And that's what he's attacking up here when really it starts here.

701
01:16:08,240 --> 01:16:11,240
Yeah. Better than here. Oh, we're not going to your point.

702
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:16,710
I really, really great point. It just made me think of I am an intern at the prosecutor's office.

703
01:16:16,740 --> 01:16:25,220
I was like writing a summary on the Lake Michigan Supreme Court ruling on the Elliot Larson civil rights case, which basically,

704
01:16:25,610 --> 01:16:34,069
like ruled that like private entities that serve the public don't have the right to deny services to somebody based on,

705
01:16:34,070 --> 01:16:35,840
like, sincerely held religious beliefs.

706
01:16:36,630 --> 01:16:44,190
Basically like, you know, you have to provide for everyone who comes to your door is not just like if they're straight or like anything else.

707
01:16:44,790 --> 01:16:48,839
But but yeah, like that would be seen as like by him,

708
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:56,790
as like the state coming in and telling you like you have to change your beliefs so that you can, like, serve like a gay couple or whatever.

709
01:16:56,790 --> 01:17:02,069
But it's just like it's through like the efforts of this has been like a very, very long battle.

710
01:17:02,070 --> 01:17:11,190
And like we're just now in the year of our Lord 2022, and Michigan has finally recognized that like you have to serve.

711
01:17:11,220 --> 01:17:14,750
If you serve the public, you have to serve everyone. Yeah.

712
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:20,490
And that has been a very long battle. A very, very long battle. Yeah. What I thought was, like, weird.

713
01:17:21,210 --> 01:17:26,400
Yeah. Was that like, he essentially equated, like, any form of activism with, like,

714
01:17:26,430 --> 01:17:31,049
being some sort of like police, like some kind of higher thinking, right?

715
01:17:31,050 --> 01:17:35,790
So, like, it's not like it was a very like populace like minded.

716
01:17:35,790 --> 01:17:38,970
It's like when, like populist leaders like Duke Power.

717
01:17:39,210 --> 01:17:48,150
Yeah, exactly. Now, one thing that's kind of end on to is that it's very interesting that he DOD University universities,

718
01:17:48,150 --> 01:17:54,450
but they use the university to make them intellectually pure, intellectually superior.

719
01:17:54,450 --> 01:17:58,740
So, Prager, you was founded in 2011 by talk show host.

720
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:03,390
It's not an academic institution. It doesn't have diplomas or anything.

721
01:18:03,570 --> 01:18:09,900
But they use that university label as a way to get legitimacy.

722
01:18:10,110 --> 01:18:17,640
So they bash universities as these liberal bastions, but then they're using that label so that they can gain legitimacy.

723
01:18:18,690 --> 01:18:21,959
So there's more candidate here.

724
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:28,980
Everyone wants to have a well, I guess we won't see you till after the break.

725
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:40,770
So remember Tuesday, use the time during class to connect with your group if you have any questions about the feedback sessions.

726
01:18:41,070 --> 01:18:42,930
Are there. Oh, well, I last I have to tell you,

727
01:18:43,110 --> 01:18:51,480
I opened up about 30 slides for group 70 with me for 30 minutes if you want to meet with me about your final project,

728
01:18:51,810 --> 01:19:02,010
I did some before presentations and some answers. Then the emails that I really want and I'm very brave.

729
01:19:06,010 --> 01:19:07,560
I know.
