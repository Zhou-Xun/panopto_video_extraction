1
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:07,616
Seniors rely on assistance
from both family members and

2
00:00:07,616 --> 00:00:11,310
formal health care services.

3
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:15,740
In the United States by far
most health care services for

4
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:19,710
seniors are paid for by Medicare.

5
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:25,270
Initially formed through
legislation in 1965 Medicare

6
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:32,620
represents one of the largest
shifts in US healthcare policy.

7
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:36,720
It was created as a national
insurance program.

8
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:41,269
With guaranteed benefits for seniors,

9
00:00:41,269 --> 00:00:44,352
those over the age of 65.

10
00:00:44,352 --> 00:00:48,956
Through the creation of this program,
seniors were guaranteed

11
00:00:48,956 --> 00:00:54,270
health care coverage for
their most important health care needs.

12
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:58,870
Specifically for hospital and
physician costs.

13
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:05,110
Which are even today the largest
part of Medicare expenditures.

14
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:09,700
And seniors who are assured
the catastrophic health care

15
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:16,350
expenses would not lead to
impoverishment or bankruptcy.

16
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:20,560
Health care is political as
we've seen in recent years.

17
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,270
And partly, it's driven by strong lobbying

18
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:30,880
efforts behind protecting both
Medicare and Social Security.

19
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:36,017
As seniors are interested
in protecting the health

20
00:01:36,017 --> 00:01:41,758
benefits that were first
established back in 1965.

21
00:01:41,758 --> 00:01:47,681
I do not intend to say that seniors
are acting strictly selfishly,

22
00:01:47,681 --> 00:01:53,711
indeed there are many who feel that
these are essential benefits for

23
00:01:53,711 --> 00:01:59,660
protecting seniors at a vulnerable
time in the life span.

24
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:05,010
And from potential impoverishment and
bankruptcy.

25
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:09,090
But practically also in
guaranteeing benefits for

26
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,430
all seniors through one system.

27
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:19,840
Medicare defines a strong common interest
in ensuring those benefits are not lost.

28
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,120
Plus imagine the concern
to other American citizens

29
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:30,800
if politicians threaten to take away
benefits for their grandparents.

30
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,860
After a tumultuous start,
Medicare now has the strongest political

31
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:41,690
backing of any healthcare
policy in the United States.

32
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:46,965
Public support for
our other large healthcare programs,

33
00:02:46,965 --> 00:02:56,740
Medicaid and Veteran's health
insurance pale in comparison.

34
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:01,848
In general,
all persons 65 years of age or older and

35
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:06,955
who have been legal residents
of the United States for

36
00:03:06,955 --> 00:03:13,320
at least five years are eligible for
Medicare.

37
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:17,550
Those who did not pay into
Medicare as employees,

38
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:24,617
must pay premiums to keep their Medicare
coverage, but essentially are covered.

39
00:03:24,617 --> 00:03:30,035
As social insurance,
the concern is in providing

40
00:03:30,035 --> 00:03:36,070
adequate coverage, for
the population as a whole.

41
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:40,740
As compared to the private
insurance market which must

42
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:46,340
focus on at least providing
what their competitors provide.

43
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:54,690
Hence the focus and Medicare is on
adequacy of the service is covered.

44
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:59,210
Whereas in principle,
in private insurance,

45
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:04,440
the principle driving
the services offered is equity

46
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:09,870
with other major health insurance plans.

47
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:13,850
Medicare is a social insurance system.

48
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:18,050
And benefits are defined
through the political process,

49
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:23,220
which is an important contrast to
what drives private insurance,

50
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:28,630
which would be individual choice for
services.

51
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:34,630
Indeed, it's very political what
elements of health care get covered,

52
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:37,550
as we'll talk about further.

53
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:43,530
And the biggest recent expansions
of Medicare have come for

54
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:48,230
very specific parts of
healthcare services.

55
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:51,050
President George W Bush,

56
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:56,880
expanded prescription drug
coverage with Medicare part D.

57
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:02,940
And President William Clinton
expanded Medicare part

58
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:11,540
C to expand managed care options for
seniors.

59
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:16,241
So if we look at Medicare's
financial situation,

60
00:05:16,241 --> 00:05:24,320
you can see partly what drives
the political focus of Medicare.

61
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:31,310
Imagine a political issue that has
the support of 78 million individuals.

62
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:37,360
In 2030, Medicare is projected
to cover that many individuals.

63
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,230
And all of them want to protect
their health care insurance.

64
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:47,336
At the same time, the medicare fund,

65
00:05:47,336 --> 00:05:53,880
which has $505 billion in it as of 2014,

66
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:59,170
makes up 14% of the federal budget.

67
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:07,264
The only larger budget area
items are social security and

68
00:06:07,264 --> 00:06:12,322
defense, which make up a 24% and

69
00:06:12,322 --> 00:06:17,570
17% of the budget respectively.

70
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:22,914
What Medicare covers is decided
through the political system.

71
00:06:22,914 --> 00:06:28,512
And if there was sufficient money to cover
our full health care needs of seniors,

72
00:06:28,512 --> 00:06:33,300
this would be a relatively
straightforward issue.

73
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:39,480
However, two current situations make
this a difficult political issue.

74
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:44,439
The federal deficit means that
we are always talking about

75
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:48,891
cutting budgets,
as 14% of the federal budget,

76
00:06:48,891 --> 00:06:55,750
Medicare is constantly being
considered for cutting.

77
00:06:55,750 --> 00:07:00,454
Second, both Medicare and
Social Security are supported

78
00:07:00,454 --> 00:07:04,488
through direct payments
from employed workers.

79
00:07:04,488 --> 00:07:10,356
As major programs funded through
employment taxes, both Medicare and

80
00:07:10,356 --> 00:07:15,148
Social Security are threatened
by the dramatic changes in

81
00:07:15,148 --> 00:07:20,740
the workforce created by
the ageing of the population.

82
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:25,830
Remember that the elderly
dependency ratio is decreasing.

83
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:32,380
By 2030 we'll have a much greater
number of individuals 65 and

84
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:39,560
older, relative to the number
of working age adults.

85
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:44,720
When you have a young population,
you have many more individuals paying

86
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,850
into these federal programs
then spending the funds.

87
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:57,820
However, as the population ages there will
be less money being put into Medicare,

88
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:05,660
relative to that 78 million individuals
who will be spending from Medicare.

89
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:11,860
Consequently, there can be no discussion
of adding coverage of services

90
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:17,130
without some discussion of
what services will be removed.

91
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:22,659
At the same time,
current Medicare spending in services,

92
00:08:22,659 --> 00:08:34,971
while unsustainable will only cover
half of individuals healthcare costs.

93
00:08:34,971 --> 00:08:41,400
This figure shows you a little bit
about who the Medicare population is.

94
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:46,800
And as seniors,
you can see that this population

95
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:54,750
needs Medicare as part of their safety net
to protect them in their senior years.

96
00:08:54,750 --> 00:09:00,085
For example,
within the Medicare population,

97
00:09:00,085 --> 00:09:04,639
savings only 50% of the population has

98
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:09,076
savings greater than $77,000.

99
00:09:09,076 --> 00:09:16,630
50% of the Medicare population
has incomes less than $25,000 and

100
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:23,723
40% of Medicare beneficiaries have 3 or
more chronic conditions.

101
00:09:23,723 --> 00:09:28,670
While 15% have two or
more ADL limitations,

102
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:39,210
this substantially increases the number
of health care services they need.

103
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:45,140
Finally an important aspect to
note is that 20% of the Medicare

104
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:50,810
population is dual-eligible for
both Medicare and Medicaid.

105
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:59,900
To qualify for Medicaid, they have to
be under state's levels of poverty.

106
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:05,573
In other words, Medicare still provides
a critical safety net for seniors, keeping

107
00:10:05,573 --> 00:10:13,816
them from paying for chronic conditions
that might otherwise impoverish them.

108
00:10:13,816 --> 00:10:18,228
So as we get into the discussion
of how Medicare and

109
00:10:18,228 --> 00:10:24,319
private insurers can control costs for
health care for the elderly,

110
00:10:24,319 --> 00:10:30,670
family care givers are an important
ally in providing care.

111
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:34,670
Family care givers are often unpaid, and

112
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:40,030
can provide a substantial
number of hours of service.

113
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:45,140
Frequently then,
policy discussions of how Medicare covers

114
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:51,010
formal care givers is impacted by

115
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:56,480
the recognition that family care
givers might provide services for

116
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,870
free, if Medicare did not cover them.

117
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:05,968
In other words,
policy reform often requires explicit

118
00:11:05,968 --> 00:11:12,692
discussion of the trade-offs between
providing paid care to seniors and

119
00:11:12,692 --> 00:11:21,358
expecting families to provide unpaid
care or to pay privately for care.

120
00:11:21,358 --> 00:11:26,759
Issues around how much care gets
provided formally or informally,

121
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:32,130
is a critical part of policy
discussions across countries.

122
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:33,500
Some countries though,

123
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:39,890
do not have a sizable population
of potential family caregivers,

124
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:46,360
either because the population is
already much smaller at younger ages.

125
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:52,960
Or because children have moved away
from their parents at fairly young ages.

126
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,020
In some countries,

127
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:59,865
families struggle to support loved
ones when disability strikes.

128
00:11:59,865 --> 00:12:05,425
Here I highlight Japan,
as a country that has been struggling for

129
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:13,355
a number of years to figure out how to
provide essential services to seniors.

130
00:12:13,355 --> 00:12:18,515
Recently, Japan has been
focused on developing

131
00:12:18,515 --> 00:12:24,540
technical assistance for
a variety of healthcare issues.

132
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:28,900
And is far more advanced than
other parts of the world

133
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:34,560
in thinking about robotics as
a way to provide assistance.

134
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:40,570
Not only do they rely on robotics
to provide mobility assistance,

135
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:45,940
but they also have been focused
on developing more hands off

136
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:51,530
approaches to waste disposal,
monitoring of seniors,

137
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:57,830
lifting assistance, and
even getting people in and

138
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:03,150
out of the bath,
in terms of bathing assistance.

139
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:09,313
This isn't necessarily where the United
States will go, but certainly shows how

140
00:13:09,313 --> 00:13:18,567
each country is finding their own unique
way to manage the aging of the population.
