1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,000
Started with my darling. I know you just.

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:13,140
Welcome back. Happy Friday. Today we have Leona, Kimi, Michael and.

3
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:20,880
Jimmy, Michael and Isabelle, who are all going to give their lightning talks.

4
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:25,180
And that is all I have on today's agenda.

5
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:32,290
So before I turn it over to our speakers, does anybody have any questions or comments?

6
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:40,120
Anything. Okay. Um, I'm not sure who wants to go first.

7
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:44,350
I've since all of you emailed me. You want to go first?

8
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:49,510
Get it done. Okay. Since all of you emailed me, your presentations are just down here at the bottom,

9
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:57,520
and I will set up a timer for 5 minutes, and I'll just kind of do this.

10
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,679
Like when you're at 4 minutes just or sorry when you're at one minute.

11
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:10,350
So you have one minute left. Just so you kind of know where you're at timing wise, I haven't been like cutting anybody off or anything,

12
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:16,360
but most of you have really stayed on the time timeframe for the talk, which is great.

13
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:23,890
So I guess I'll go ahead and turn it over to you. Can you if you want to get started, I mentioned this.

14
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:43,600
Okay? Yeah. All right. So my work is on characterizing light exposure impact on higher energy pathways in the cardiovascular system.

15
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:51,280
So I think most of you probably know cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide as well as in the United States.

16
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:59,500
And it includes a variety of illnesses, including atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, arrhythmias and heart valve problems.

17
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:06,340
And then also probably something you guys know is that lead is a very common industrial contaminant that remains a problem worldwide.

18
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:15,070
And in the U.S., even though it's consumer use was banned in the 1970s, still present in older lead pipes, lead paint or through industrial use.

19
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:22,330
And studies have found that lead exposure is associated with the development or progression of cardio vascular disease.

20
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,070
And one way that lead may contribute to cardiovascular disease is through modulation of the epigenome.

21
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:32,920
Studies have found that lead can alter DNA methylation levels in the heart tissue.

22
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:39,190
So another component of the epigenome, which I'm interested in, is the pirating and PBL system.

23
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:43,560
And so importantly, non-coding DNA makes up 98% of your genome.

24
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:46,840
And previously people thought that that was just junk DNA.

25
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:53,079
They didn't think it had any real function. And then they found that all these non-coding RNAs are actually playing really important

26
00:02:53,080 --> 00:03:01,090
functions in cell differentiation and other important developmental pathways in our bodies.

27
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:05,499
And Pioneer are one type of non-coding RNAs that regulate expression of

28
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,670
transposable elements through methylation and therefore maintain genomic integrity.

29
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:14,890
And they're very well understood as playing this function in the germline.

30
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:19,060
But it's less well understood what function they're playing in somatic tissues, including in the heart.

31
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:28,270
And then, as you can see in this diagram, the pioneer shown in blue bind to these people are pui proteins and their pioneer associated

32
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:33,670
proteins and that's really brown and they associate with the pioneer to guide their actions.

33
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:38,200
And then pioneer dysregulation can result in different disease states there.

34
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,120
It's there's a lot of studies out there associating pioneer dysregulation with cancer but

35
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,680
it was well understood how they may associate with development of cardiovascular disease.

36
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:54,750
So differential expression of higher end AIDS and Peebles are associated with different stages of cardiac differentiation.

37
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:01,270
Pioneer transcripts are found to correspond to genes important in cardiac development in these cardiac progenitor cells,

38
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:06,069
cardiac development, muscle differentiation and contraction are all major pathways.

39
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,059
They found through a gene.

40
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:15,250
Ontology, analysis and pilot expression has also been associated with cardiac hypertrophy in vivo and in vitro disease models.

41
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:21,520
And then epidemiological studies have shown that there's association between patients with heart failure,

42
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:25,990
chronic thromboembolic, pulmonary hypertension and myocardial infarctions.

43
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:32,229
So putting it all together, we know that lead exposure is associated with cardiovascular disease and that

44
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,590
developmental that exposure can alter DNA methylation patterns in the heart.

45
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:40,450
We also know that pioneering people expression changes at different stages of cardiac cell differentiation,

46
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:44,140
and that pioneer dysregulation is associated with cardiovascular disease.

47
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:52,900
So my main research question is our let exposure pioneer biology and cardiac development and or cardiovascular disease progression related.

48
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,090
So my hypothesis is that developmental exposure to LED this regulates PI or any

49
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:02,230
pathways which contributes to the development of cardiovascular disease later in life.

50
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:08,590
So my first aim is just to map the pioneers present in heart tissue.

51
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:12,249
And I'm going to do this both in in-vivo mouse heart tissue as well as in vitro

52
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:17,680
differentiating cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells.

53
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:25,120
And my aim to I'll look at how pilot and pupil biology changes in these two models when exposed to lead.

54
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:34,930
And then my third aim will be to look at the functionality of specific pupils by knocking down or overexpressing these proteins in the cardiomyocytes.

55
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:44,560
So so far I have a little bit of data that suggests that changes in people expression in hearts from mice exposed to lead apparently,

56
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:55,270
which means the light exposure started before started before MIT, two weeks before mating and ended at weaning age of three weeks.

57
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:04,060
So we found changes in people expression in the hearts from mice exposed to lead that suggest led may alter pioneer biology in a sex specific manner.

58
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:09,280
So you can see all three people as expressed in the mice have significant changes

59
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,649
in the only in males and with an upregulation of pupil one downregulation,

60
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:21,219
if you will, to an upregulation of people. Four And this is very interesting given that cardiovascular disease had major

61
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:26,440
sex difference in their progression and mortality ratios and stuff like that.

62
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:32,710
So that's all for now. I want to say thank you to my lab and their pets.

63
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:40,139
Yeah, I couldn't. I can't. Yeah, that's Laurie's cat.

64
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:46,730
There's a smokers dog there, like I've got to do.

65
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:56,820
Got. Did you have questions, Mark?

66
00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:00,959
Yeah. So you sort of came to him then my sample.

67
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,220
I know you have. And I could use a sample of the present sample.

68
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:13,980
Do you think you need to get anything? No. I only saw the difference in the ten month sample, so I don't know what that means, but.

69
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,890
Yeah. You hope that I can identify what is going on there.

70
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,210
Your target is at least in London. Yes.

71
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:33,630
To some some of the AP studies,

72
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:40,800
as well as some of the like minor mechanistic studies have identified particular priorities that they think could be potential therapeutics.

73
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:49,379
I think we have a long way to go, just like the like pie irony landscape hasn't really been that much delved into.

74
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:54,900
I think there is the one paper that I show the gene ontology analysis from is like the

75
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:59,570
first one to like map out the pioneers and differentiate differentiating cardiac cells.

76
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:17,750
So. It's not.

77
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,970
I'm getting out of the front of the room as fast as I can.

78
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:37,520
Yes. Yeah.

79
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:47,149
Over. So.

80
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:52,100
Hi, my name's Leon Jiang and I am a master's in Environmental Health Sciences.

81
00:08:52,670 --> 00:09:00,139
I recently switched to MSC, so I'm currently in the process of like adjusting and brainstorming my master's thesis.

82
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,090
But today I'm just going to briefly go over it.

83
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:10,160
And it's about geospatial patterns and distribution of PM 2.5 and awake exposure relevant to infant mortality in Michigan.

84
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:17,930
So a little background about PM 2.5 and no ex PM 2.5 is a fine particulate matter

85
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:23,329
with a diameter of smaller than 2.5 micrometers and is one of the air pollutants

86
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:28,670
that's currently in like a big concern for a long period of time and is known to

87
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:33,739
penetrate deeply into our alveoli region of the lung due to its particulate size,

88
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:38,780
causing various respiratory diseases and increasing risk of cardiovascular disease.

89
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,030
And there it is also known to have some effects, direct effects on Infants and Children,

90
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:52,340
Positive Association between Infant and Child under five mortality and PM 2.5 exposures where the relative risk was higher than one,

91
00:09:52,730 --> 00:10:00,260
which would mean that the well mortality is more likely to occur as the exposure increases and research shows that increased

92
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:12,500
risk of preterm birth in low birth weight is likely to occur with PM 2.5 exposure and moving on to the nitrogen oxide and oaks.

93
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:20,150
Well, it's one of the six criteria in air pollutant that have been actively controlled and is one of the group of highly reactive gases.

94
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:29,150
And some of the adverse health effects include respiratory diseases such as cough, hemo, hemodialysis and dyspnea.

95
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:35,990
And the direct effects on infants include increased risk of SIDS, which is sudden infant death syndrome,

96
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:41,479
even with short term exposure of noacs and also increased exposure is also associated

97
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:45,680
with delayed neurodevelopment of children in their early first 24 months.

98
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:56,950
So my objective for my thesis is to analyze statewide geospatial patterns of greenspace and the distribution of PM 2.5 and oaks.

99
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:02,420
Exposure is relevant to infant health, specifically infant mortality in Michigan and for the locations.

100
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:12,860
Since I'm looking into Greenspaces, I'll be looking at the urban areas of metropolitan statistical areas in Detroit, Grand Rapids and Saginaw area.

101
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:17,000
So why it matters and its significance.

102
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:23,960
I've been doing a lot of literature research and found that previous research only looks at the relationship between air pollutants,

103
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:30,410
human health, or the relationship between greenspace and infant health, such as preterm birth and childhood development in the United States.

104
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:37,760
And only few have assessed the relationship between death among infants, different air pollutants and the effect on greenspace, all three of them.

105
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:43,969
And the reason that I wanted to look into greenspace as well is that greenspace is an important factor when evaluating

106
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:49,280
different health effects and pollution levels and brings diverse health benefits to people in the surrounding areas,

107
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:55,309
such as better pregnant pregnancy outcomes, brain development, mental health and decrease in mortality.

108
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:59,960
So I wanted to include that as as in in my objectives.

109
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:09,350
And from this, I'm hoping that it will help the community fully understand which location may have higher cumulative

110
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:15,530
exposures and recommend better management strategies so appropriate regulation and management can be applied.

111
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:25,270
So my current status, I'm currently in the process of collecting and identifying data that include all the necessary information.

112
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:34,719
Some of the data I'm considering are AC DC Wonder, which is from a data study designed to provide public health information such as death,

113
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:41,860
infant death, birth car accidents and cancer incidence in environment and occupational health.

114
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:47,200
And also Nando, which is also a data that addresses places such as land covers of vegetation.

115
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:51,280
And I'm also planning to use programs such as ArcGIS to create results.

116
00:12:52,630 --> 00:13:05,750
And that's it. Questions.

117
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:12,510
In your study. One Will your definition of green space to be who will be the criteria?

118
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:24,450
Oh, it would be the areas green on the person, just green space level in metropolitan urban areas like parks and it mostly parks and thinking about.

119
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:36,330
Have you used gas before or are you learning this as you go?

120
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:40,240
I've been using J.S. before. So there'll be something somewhere.

121
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:53,230
It's. Quite honestly.

122
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:09,480
But they didn't to have it.

123
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:47,330
So how do I put this interview on this phone again?

124
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:51,530
It's just at the bottom. It was it was right there.

125
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,710
Oh, you want to have your. Yeah, I have a few notes I don't know how to do.

126
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:02,130
Does anybody else I said about the commercials that I.

127
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:13,460
Would you like to present your loan?

128
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:20,450
Yeah. 2%, isn't it? From the top with the orange over there.

129
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:29,960
There is ice cream with that like an arrow, if you look at it from right here, not to the left side.

130
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:36,440
Yeah, but that's not coming up. I think you go to my show in the presenter.

131
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:45,420
Yeah, I'm in a slide show. Presenter Viewers are coming up.

132
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:59,400
And yet the modern old masters try and play from beginning to end too.

133
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:07,260
Yeah, but. Yeah, but what you have know is that she does still have notes on.

134
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:12,330
That's true. Second one. You see them now?

135
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:26,790
If you want. I don't know if it. If it's I mean, the stuff is like even in that sizes.

136
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,800
I mean, it's a little bit small, but if you wanted to make it as large as you can and still as an item,

137
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:39,360
not as a not as ideal, but you can also turn off the display duplication.

138
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:45,420
And once the computer recognizes that there's two screens instead of one, one will broadcast presenter view on the other broadcaster.

139
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:50,250
Oh, really? I do that. Thank you.

140
00:16:50,440 --> 00:17:06,970
Oh, that's what I think. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The display settings are now duplicated.

141
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:11,920
So you want to turn off duplication.

142
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:17,930
Extend the. Okay.

143
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:25,730
So there's a. Presenter.

144
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:39,090
Thank you. I'd like to tell everyone my name is Isabelle mellas and I am a first year M.S. toxicology student here.

145
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:41,970
As a first year, I haven't done any research here yet,

146
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:46,930
so I'm just going to be talking about some of my previous research in undergrad and some of my current interests.

147
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:53,250
So I recently graduated from Lake Superior State University with degrees in chemistry and forensic chemistry.

148
00:17:53,820 --> 00:18:00,420
So my research mostly focused on the forensics aspect of it, and I looked at the quantification of cocaine on paper currency.

149
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:10,350
So from some literature review, we were able to determine that the prevalence of drugs of abuse on paper currency is well established,

150
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:13,380
along with several methods for detecting and quantifying them.

151
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:18,509
So several studies have shown that a significant proportion of paper currency in worldwide

152
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:23,340
circulation is contaminated with cocaine and a range of other controlled substances.

153
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:35,220
So cocaine or other drugs present on a single banknote can be spread to a vast amount of different paper currency in general circulation.

154
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:43,560
So individuals with no personal connection to controlled substances could be in possession of drugs containing trace amounts of paper currency.

155
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:48,930
So these initial studies specifically focused on cocaine because cocaine is often

156
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:52,770
paper currency is often used as a drug delivery device for snorting cocaine.

157
00:18:53,910 --> 00:19:01,830
And then in addition to this, drug misuse has several diverse patterns all across different counties in different countries and regions.

158
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:09,270
So there might be some effect on the cocaine contamination, on currency and on different denominations of currency because of this,

159
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:15,420
which was part of what my research sought to do, is to look at some of these things that could have an effect on the amount detected.

160
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:25,150
So the objective of my research was to assess whether the following had effects on the detectable levels of a cocaine on paper currency,

161
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:27,040
so the type of commercial business would ensue.

162
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:33,820
St Marie, Michigan The nomination of the bill, the local community events listed there, and then the geographical location.

163
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:37,570
And this was done with one external site and that being McComb, Michigan.

164
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:44,170
And this was done the single collection event. It's kind of an overview of my methodology.

165
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:51,729
So to obtain the currency for testing five of each denomination of currency being tested,

166
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:56,930
so one, five, ten and $20 bills were exchanged from these stores listed here.

167
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:01,500
Each of the bills were swabbed and the samples were diluted with methanol,

168
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:05,860
and then the samples were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography,

169
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:09,400
tandem mass spectroscopy, using the ingredient found in this table here.

170
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:15,340
And then this is just a picture of the instrument we use, and I have at least eight to carry out this method.

171
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:24,820
So of 260 of the total bill swabs, we found that about 84% of them had detectable amounts of cocaine.

172
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:30,460
So this bar graphs are showing the percentage found for each belt, each nomination of currency.

173
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,290
And then a total of 65 bills were swapped and analyzed for each denomination.

174
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:44,620
So once the concentrations on each boat we determined were determined, we looked at the average concentrations for each store on each collection day.

175
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:48,610
So we had Myer, a liquor store, and then a holiday gas station.

176
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:54,010
Meyer had the highest concentrations of the three stores on two of our four collection dates.

177
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:01,060
So this is showing the concentration for each denomination of paper currency.

178
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:04,480
So each dot on this graph represents a single bill swabbed and analyzed.

179
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:10,870
Of the denominations are only these three instances here in which the concentrations were observable

180
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:15,940
be different from that of the others with most being around this .02 microgram per milliliter range.

181
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:24,389
So in a single collection event, we compared concentrations of paper currency from McComb,

182
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:28,110
Michigan, to that of our closest collection date in Su Saint Marie.

183
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:35,130
So this is just in our three stores in McComb and then in our three stores in the U.S., right in the McComb, which was from a gas station.

184
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:44,579
So it's found that currency in McComb had slightly higher levels of concentrations of cocaine than currency from Su Saint Marie,

185
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:50,220
which we are attributing to population differences. It's quite a big difference in population between the two cities.

186
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:59,880
However, this collection data specifically was our lowest 4% of cocaine found, with only about 43% of our pills found to have cocaine.

187
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:12,320
So after studying chemistry for four years, I found myself extremely interested in how chemistry can be used to help us understand,

188
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,500
monitor, protect and improve the environment around us.

189
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:19,490
Additionally, and how chemistry directly affects our everyday lives.

190
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:25,069
So I'm particularly interested interested in the impact of chemical and environmental

191
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:29,360
exposures on the development and functionality of the reproductive system.

192
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:37,879
In addition to this, whether these exposures have further adverse effects relating to pregnancy outcomes such as preterm birth,

193
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:41,300
miscarriage, paraplegia, gestational diabetes and others,

194
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:47,570
it's also possible we like to look at how the chemical structure of a compound and its functional groups

195
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:54,530
can be related to its toxicity and its effects on the reproductive and reproductive system and pregnancy.

196
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:09,320
I have two questions. First of all, great job, really nice flow, nice slides, like really well done.

197
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:19,220
I am wondering if you think that the fact that you sampled from a gas station as opposed to a liquor store in a grocery store,

198
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:27,200
when you are comparing to, say, marine impact in your comparison at all and why you chose a gas station.

199
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:33,080
So I had a single gas station. So this holiday holiday is a gas station.

200
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:42,850
So it is one of our options. And we all the cash we have was only enough to do one store at Amoco and Coleman.

201
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:48,810
McCall was my hometown and Suzanne Marie is there. Five hour was away from each other since that time, just right?

202
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:52,850
Yeah, we wanted to do that just to, like,

203
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:59,510
instigate possible further research into looking at how different cities and population size can affect the different concentration levels.

204
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:04,850
Yeah, that makes sense. I had a second question, but you kind of answered it.

205
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:16,190
Oh, you're good. Sorry you covered this, but what are the implications of these trace amounts of cocaine on a lake?

206
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:25,280
But why are you worried about that? So in like trials and things looking at like drug trafficking bills can only be taken into evidence

207
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:32,719
if they significantly deviate from the concentrations found on bills and like the cities,

208
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:38,450
like the average concentration found in certain cities. So you have to be able to differentiate the two.

209
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:43,100
So you have to show that there is a correlation between those bills being used for drug trafficking.

210
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,180
Okay. No, no, I just have it.

211
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,200
Just out of curiosity, what software did you use to analyze?

212
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:56,600
You come out of grams? Um, so we I don't exactly have that up there.

213
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:05,720
Our software was built in, so we have like a computer specifically for each of our instruments in our lab.

214
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:12,470
So I don't know exactly which one off the top of my head, you know, model that used.

215
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:19,889
It's been a it's been moment since I looked at them. I don't quite know off the top of my head.

216
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:24,930
I'm sorry. I was. What are you, Islamic nations that you study?

217
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:30,630
We do not have the funds like, say, a very small, small school up in the U.P.

218
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:38,690
So it was what we were able to do because we wanted to be able to have a large amount for each specific nomination to show,

219
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:46,560
like the repetition between everything. So using bills above 29, it was reasonable to be able to fund the project.

220
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:57,510
Based on that finding, like the percentage of buildings that found the residues or whatever the proper term is,

221
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:08,460
can you infer like a total amount of usage or traffic or anything like that where you kind of do it the other way?

222
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:18,280
Yeah, kind of. Because you want to. Huh?

223
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:29,620
Like, I guess my question is, how does that number represent the greater amount of what you'd expect to see on like all the dollar bills in Michigan?

224
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:33,880
So there are not really been any studies done in Michigan specifically.

225
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:44,230
A lot of studies just focus on detecting it, not really on seeing certain things can affect the variations.

226
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:48,280
Um, so we don't really know what's expected in Michigan.

227
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:55,540
So it's kind of trying to create this baseline number for bills in certain cities.

228
00:26:56,250 --> 00:27:03,430
Cool. So you're not well, can you?

229
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:08,980
Can you if they're also related to your question, what kind of population?

230
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:19,490
Are you using more drugs in in the in the study that you're doing or the population and why you have more in.

231
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:29,149
I don't remember the name of the. The highest that you have the grade one and Paul McComb we call why there is more

232
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:35,960
there is is a kind of oh so I don't know what what kind of a story is that?

233
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:42,370
Oh, so this one was a gas station. And then this one here is also a gas station just in a different city.

234
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:52,910
So it's kind of looking, trying very loosely to see how the population affects the differences and contamination levels.

235
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:56,810
So we only have one collection of them for McComb.

236
00:27:57,290 --> 00:28:01,699
So you'd have to do like further research to be able to actually see any sort

237
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:05,510
of significant if there's any sort of significant difference between the two.

238
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:45,400
A make up of a first year stock student here in the rest of Michigan.

239
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:53,680
And I'll be talking to each year about my research interests and how that relates to my past undergraduate research.

240
00:28:56,730 --> 00:29:05,010
So my research I Calvin University was in collaboration with the Plastic Creek stewards and it was focused on the environmental

241
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:11,850
watershed restoration efforts to bring back beauty and help to both the creek itself and then the community around it.

242
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:20,460
It's a threefold approach to this research, which focused on education research and on the ground restoration efforts.

243
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:26,640
And we were interested in seeing the sources of pollution on in the Plastic Creek.

244
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:36,540
And what we came to was that we saw agricultural, residential and industrial practices that polluted the plastic reef.

245
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:43,470
And also stormwater runoff also was a major source of pollution for Plastic Creek as well.

246
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:56,280
We also evaluated or saw some environmental justice issues present in the community as people who lived

247
00:29:56,580 --> 00:30:03,870
downstream of the creek were minority groups and were disproportionately like facing challenges.

248
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:12,510
Decontamination process done upstream, like on farming practices and other residential practices.

249
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:25,850
So with the help of federal agencies and local entities like the King County Drain Commission and other local partners,

250
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:29,870
we were able to install and maintain green infrastructure,

251
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:38,720
which we need to mitigate plants and retention ponds like you'd see up there, and rain gardens like you can see down the road.

252
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:46,580
And that is where usually our retirement homes or community members applied to have these installed in their homes.

253
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:56,750
These so the retention ponds like this allow plastic free to meander through retention ponds and slow down.

254
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:07,700
These allows for the sediment, high levels of sediments and sediment out and also slows the creek down to prevent further erosion of the creek.

255
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:14,710
We also replanted those Michigan native plants into the creek to help process this

256
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:20,270
on water runoff to help reduce that amount of water going through the creek.

257
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:28,760
We also did public education in collaboration with community partners through volunteer work days.

258
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:35,960
We evaluated Creek Samplings to see major sources of contamination, whether there were biological, chemical contaminants.

259
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:46,040
And through that Green Team initiative, I was able to mentor a team of green minority high school students that were living

260
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:50,660
in parts of this watershed that were impacted by these contamination practices.

261
00:31:52,860 --> 00:32:03,450
Since we were in the data collection and project implementation phase of this project, I don't have the graphs to show you,

262
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:10,740
but these were some of the results and potential results we will see we hope to see from our efforts in the community.

263
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:21,420
So one is to reduce that pressure on the aging pipe infrastructure as we help process that stormwater runoff that goes into a creek.

264
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:27,570
We also try to reduce high fragmentation levels and equalize levels.

265
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:37,830
We hope to increase awareness on contamination practices and the present environmental justice issues in the watershed community.

266
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:42,030
And through the Green Team Initiative,

267
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:52,050
we we empower the next generation of environmental leaders and also demystify the whole college process to these young minority high school students.

268
00:32:54,140 --> 00:33:00,590
So next this got me thinking about how chemical and biological contaminants impact community health.

269
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:11,960
So I went on to work for a tux company called Charles River and worked on toxicology studies to get more experience in toxicology.

270
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:25,880
And now I'm here and interested in using epigenetics as a mechanism to assess toxicity and the developmental origins of diseases and hope that this,

271
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:32,240
my research would be able to inform future policies and tackle environmental justice issues as well.

272
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:42,890
So currently I'm talking to my advisor and I think I'm interested in my project as it has also has that community collaboration aspect to it.

273
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:46,610
And I can yeah, it's something I'm interested in.

274
00:33:48,260 --> 00:34:02,180
Thank you. Any questions? Yes.

275
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:06,760
He talked a little bit about the mentorship work that you're doing with local high school students.

276
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:11,010
So I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about how that was structured,

277
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:15,400
how many people you are working with, heads of topics you hand over, because I thought that was really cool.

278
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:20,350
So the green team, these are the green team students.

279
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:29,049
They have to apply through their high schools. And these were high schools that were in the downstream part of their secretes.

280
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:34,930
So they were highly impacted by the contamination practices, for one, and the minority students.

281
00:34:35,410 --> 00:34:43,270
So the goal of the Green team is to increase awareness of this contamination crisis and environmental justice issues in minority schools as well.

282
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:51,400
And there are some people, white people in there, but that also to help increase awareness for that community, too.

283
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:57,260
It was two sessions for the summer, the first year.

284
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:01,330
The first group had the first half of the summer, and then the second group had the second half.

285
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:07,750
And we we had days that we went on tours.

286
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:18,220
We had like days like this. We had days where environmental leaders and professionals came in to give talks to these students to help educate them.

287
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:27,159
Yeah, it was mainly like tours were based and seminars for the kids.

288
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:33,250
You. Oh, really?

289
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:39,940
Good job. You do? What got you interested in this project to begin with?

290
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:48,609
Yeah. So I applied to through my school for a summer research project.

291
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:58,000
I'm mainly interested in, like, ecology and health. So this is a nice middle point for ecology and public health to come together.

292
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:08,850
And, yeah, that's what got me into research. Yeah. But did you do a Charles River as a research technician?

293
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:12,080
So we in surgery and life.

294
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:23,930
So I did most pre care pre and post op care that was then through different goes rounds on and each piece of like biologics and pharmaceuticals.

295
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:34,250
Nonhuman primates. Monkeys. Okay. And then I got moved to ophthalmology where I thought I studied mostly until it was like dose.

296
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:45,500
And I feel like different methods by which the I and then we got to do like observations and stuff like that,

297
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:49,430
like, like subdivision rhythms and thing. Yeah, right.

298
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:55,400
Yeah. Primate rabbits. Primary therapy through ophthalmology.

299
00:36:56,030 --> 00:37:04,120
Yeah. Thank you.

300
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:15,229
No, I didn't have anything else on the agenda today. We closed a little bit early.

301
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:20,350
So I think we can we can call it a little early start, Erica.

302
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:29,570
Art classes? Yes. Well, I don't get to, like, go home and start my weekend either.

303
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:34,960
But I think we'll have a good weekend once you get to your weekend.

304
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:46,440
Oh, well, this is all right. So I was living in Sydney for the next year.

305
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:53,335
Oh, yeah, definitely.
