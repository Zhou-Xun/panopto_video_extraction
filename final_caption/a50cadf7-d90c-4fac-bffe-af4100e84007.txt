1
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:41,970
Okay. Good morning, everyone. So, as usual, we start with.

2
00:00:43,460 --> 00:01:10,350
The previous lecture. So we introduced the notion of independence, and this is largely a familiar material to you.

3
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:20,740
Except that we added independence of Sigma algebras to what you had in six or one.

4
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:29,110
Other than that, it's basically same theory. Then.

5
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:43,750
So we had. We have the rigorous formulation of absolute continuity.

6
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:51,820
That we've been using so far. Informally.

7
00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:03,710
But this time it was defined as one measure being absolutely continuous with respect to another measure.

8
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:12,080
So per definition, this is when I have a set of zero other measure.

9
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:21,590
Then it also is a set of measure zero with the target measure that the target measures goal absolutely

10
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:27,440
continuous with respect to this other one and most of the time this other one is in the back measure.

11
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:34,470
It doesn't have to be a probability measure, by the way. Then.

12
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:45,129
We formulated the theorem, uh, that is similar to the six or one stuff where you said that,

13
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:50,770
uh, variable is continuous when PDF exists, except perhaps a set of measures zero.

14
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:55,840
So this addition was not in 601, but uh, it's kind of a trivial one.

15
00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:07,659
Uh, but now we have the analog of that statement, namely that this is absolutely continuous with respect to.

16
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:17,590
Q Then we have the integral representation, and this time this integral is not over X but in general over AUMENTO.

17
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:23,200
So this is the analog of the existence of PDF instead of PDF.

18
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:30,790
This was called the rather nicotine derivative by the name of the respective theorem.

19
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:53,200
So that was the. Absolute continuity story.

20
00:03:54,570 --> 00:04:05,480
Then we kind of in passing, we defined what it means to have a conditional expectation of X given Y is equal to Y.

21
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:17,049
So this was as a reminder, so far not treated in this course in any way because you can treat it as a six or one conditional expectation

22
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:23,350
because the probability in the condition may be zero if Y is an absolute the continuous random variable.

23
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:31,720
On the other hand. So of expectations, conditional expectations in this course work with respect to sigma algebra.

24
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:35,620
And this is definitely not a sigma algebra is just a single.

25
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,470
So it falls in neither of the two frameworks.

26
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:54,100
So in order to deal with this, we basically noted that if I have a conditional expectation of X given Y, then this is.

27
00:04:55,250 --> 00:05:00,410
A random variable measurable with respect to the sigma algebra generated by Y.

28
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:17,180
Right. And so that that makes any function that is any random any other random variable measurable with respect to that same sigma algebra,

29
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:23,930
it makes it a deterministic function of the conditional expectation.

30
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:32,450
And this was exploited to define this guy because it was defined as such a function when of the argument y.

31
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:37,960
And so we found that intuitive because.

32
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:50,210
Because of the table that we had for discrete when the variables uh when when y is a discrete random variable in it's in the condition.

33
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:59,040
So we had a table. All of the values of that, uh, random variable and the conditional expectation.

34
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:04,500
Those two columns define the function. That's.

35
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:10,580
That's basically expressed as one column as a function of another or the other way around.

36
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:16,640
And in case I have kind of a continuous random variable or a mixed one,

37
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:27,830
there will be some events where my discrete random variable is not a constant within the event, but some of them will generate into singletons.

38
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:36,260
But the fact that one column is a function of another will stay and this allows a allowed us to define that expectation.

39
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:51,090
Uh, and then, uh, so we started looking at, uh, expectations taken over a multivariable probability space when we have vector value, random variables.

40
00:06:51,450 --> 00:07:00,990
So there were two in all of our examples, but it uh, carries over to arbitrary number, of course, and even to the uncountable number.

41
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:13,969
Then. So we used the formula of total expectation and there was a theorem that we essentially borrowed from calculus or real

42
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:22,820
analysis that was called the feminist theorem that says that that level of total expectation can actually be simplified.

43
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:31,280
If all of my read the variables are independent, then instead of double integrals, I can consider repeated integrals a mess that the girls.

44
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,870
And this is where we stopped.

45
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:44,949
So we took this theorem without a proof that the so the curious of you could look into real analysis books for the proofs.

46
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:49,370
It's not a difficult one. Okay.

47
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:55,040
And then so having formulated the for being new theorem.

48
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:02,560
So let's give some examples. For its use.

49
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:32,920
Now, first of all. So when we have not one, but multiple random variables that would be accountable or uncountable number.

50
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:41,890
So what kind of problems does it serve? It serves all kinds of models, more or less complicated, right?

51
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:51,940
So you have regression models where you have beta x plus epsilon, where X is covariance.

52
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,420
So that's a sum of a bunch of random variables.

53
00:08:55,900 --> 00:09:00,460
We have sequences of random variables that that we sum up.

54
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:06,430
And this happens, for example, when you compute the sample mean.

55
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:11,650
Right. So there are a bunch of random variables that added up.

56
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:19,630
There's also measurement error models where you assume that you measure a covariant with error.

57
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:26,770
So what you observe is then a sum of two and the variables, the true value of the covariance plus the error.

58
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:32,440
Right. So you don't observe them separately, you observe just the result of it and so on.

59
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:45,010
So and one of the tools to manage this and this phenomena, when you sum up a couple of random variables, it's called convolution.

60
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:55,060
So you must have had them in six or one or elsewhere.

61
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:03,310
So we are just refreshing it. Let's say I have x one and x two.

62
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:12,470
There are some random variables. And the very and they are independent.

63
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:17,170
So this would allow me to use the four beaches here in.

64
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:27,780
Take them. So before the Philippines, hear him say, I have a joint CDF.

65
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:42,100
It's not a joint. Okay. So I have to say, I have a new random variable that's of interest.

66
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:57,360
So I'm interested in the sum of these two. Right.

67
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:01,040
So then I can do a CDF.

68
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:10,300
Of that sum. Let's say it's a function of X.

69
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:21,160
And this is by definition a probability of x one last six to.

70
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:36,069
Uh, less than six. Okay. So we also had in the previous lecture the construction of probability spaces for multivariate random variables.

71
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:40,020
So how do we understand that set in the probability?

72
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:43,600
So first of all, this is Z, right?

73
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:54,570
Or X where X is. A vector random variable x1 x2.

74
00:11:55,260 --> 00:12:00,000
Right. So the sap is actually p of the pre image.

75
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,630
Of the events in brackets.

76
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:11,510
And so the event in brackets is so if I have two Xs, right?

77
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:17,950
I have x two and x1x is.

78
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:23,480
They. And so the I have x.

79
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:34,130
So if I have the quality instead of inequality, I will have x to equal to x minus x one.

80
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:43,580
So I'm going to have this line like these and everything left to the it is my area.

81
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:54,820
Right. So that's the and the pre image of that area will give me a said on the on a scale that I would take probability of.

82
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:58,900
And it will also be a two dimensional set in general.

83
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:15,830
Okay. Um, so then I can write these, uh, based on this understanding and this would be an integral game over the area.

84
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:19,670
X one license to less than x.

85
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:26,250
And the measure is the joint distribution function.

86
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:32,390
And this time it's x one and x two.

87
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:36,650
Or I could simply write X instead.

88
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:41,210
Wait. Because the x is the. I think it's a very good.

89
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:46,610
So it has two arguments x one and x two.

90
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:55,640
So any two dimensional set is measured using a probability measure induced by the joint CD F of x.

91
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:11,990
And so far, things are general. And so we want to simplify this construction because, well, integrals like these is an unpleasant thing.

92
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:19,400
Two dimensional, we want to reduce it to nested one dimensional integrals.

93
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:25,010
And the thing that allows us to do that is the familiar theorem.

94
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:33,230
As I read the variables, the components of X are independent.

95
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:37,460
Right. And there we have a choice.

96
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:41,300
So I'm now jumping to calculus. Right.

97
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:48,140
Multivariable calculus, when I'm writing this integral is to repeat it once.

98
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:55,640
Now I have a choice how to do it. Um, so again, this is my picture x2.

99
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:01,130
This is x1. So this is a good refresher.

100
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:11,670
Of the calculus. I have my line and then I need to cover the area under that line with.

101
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:17,220
Uh. Method. One dimensional integrals.

102
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:21,420
Now I have a choice how I integrate. Right.

103
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:24,029
So I could do anything I want, right?

104
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:33,629
So I could do lines like these that are orthogonal to this one and integrate over these lines and then over the coordinates along the line,

105
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:37,800
for example. That would be an exotic way to represent the area.

106
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:51,750
Right. Or I can do I can integrate, for example, over X one first and then for a fixed value of x one, I would integrate over x two.

107
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:55,740
So this way I could do the other way around. Then I would feel it.

108
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:01,630
The pattern with horizontal lines instead of vertical lines.

109
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:07,560
Okay. So I am right.

110
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,100
I will take the. That's one integral.

111
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:28,110
Yes, the outer one. So I integrate over all values of X1 first and given the value of x one, I will integrate over x two along these lines.

112
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:41,050
Right? So this is how it goes. And then moving x one from minus infinity to infinity, I will cover the whole area under the line.

113
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:45,850
Now the points on the line are values of.

114
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:57,890
It's two that are equal. Uh, two x minus x one.

115
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:09,570
And when I'm going under the line so I'm the sap would be X to less than x minus x one.

116
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:20,980
So my second vintage girl is going to be an integral x to last an x minus x one.

117
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:40,170
Okay. And then so because of independence, these guy X is actually a product of fx1 times affixed to.

118
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:45,250
Right and my inner integral is over x two.

119
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:52,760
So that is f x to. Oh, that's true.

120
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,570
Yeah. My outlet into Girl is over one.

121
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:01,740
So this is this one. Export.

122
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:12,380
Okay. So this is how it goes. That that is kind of the same argument that would date in the formula of total expectations.

123
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:18,920
When we have two independent random variables over each, the expectation is taken.

124
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:24,739
So namely, we, uh, pulled out one of the random variables.

125
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:30,649
So in this case it's the X1 and take the expectation of x two.

126
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:36,590
So what, what's here is the probability of an indicator function, right.

127
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:41,239
Of this, of the events.

128
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:54,490
That is the pre image of this guy. But if we're approaching this purely from a calculus viewpoint, so this guy factors into two of them, right?

129
00:18:54,490 --> 00:19:01,240
So I have an integral over x one over x two when I'm treating x one as a constant.

130
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:09,580
So this is this kind of calculus observation is similar to treating one of the random variable.

131
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:19,899
Some of the conditioning I see in the algebra that this variable is measurable with respect to also has a constant the inner expectation.

132
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:28,510
Right. So that's a similar trick. Right? Then when I have taken this integral, it will be some function of X one, right, because I was holding it out.

133
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:39,400
And then so this is sort of an implicit function unless I can take it in the closed form and I can certainly I can do that right.

134
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:48,580
As we will see in a. The outer integral is another one dimensional integral now or x one over this function.

135
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:55,300
Okay. So now what? Is this guy inside?

136
00:19:55,540 --> 00:20:03,230
Right. So that's the probability related to X two.

137
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:13,920
So the marginal one. So we have probabilities, if you remember when we defined multivariate spaces.

138
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:21,600
So I can define the probability space for x one. I can also define the separate one for x to.

139
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:27,250
Um. Or I can define the one for the joints.

140
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:30,130
Read the variable that's x one and x two.

141
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:39,820
And there's certainly a correspondence between the univariate probability spaces that are defined for x one and 4x2.

142
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:44,169
And these are in the context of having to read the variables.

143
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:54,180
They would be called marginal. And so but in the joint probability space, everything is expressed as a pair.

144
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:58,410
Right. Because it's a Cartesian product of of.

145
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:02,880
Sets related to X1, sets related to X2.

146
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:12,450
So this is the only distinction. Right. So if I have some set from the sigma algebra, uh, that.

147
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:23,210
X1 is defined on the marginal one when they're not looking at X2 and B from there.

148
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:30,760
Then if I have the joint, they would correspond to the pair a and the full make the.

149
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:35,960
And the bill respond to.

150
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:48,080
The to the full in the end be. All right.

151
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:54,570
So that's the only distinction between separate and defines probability space and some joint.

152
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:00,220
Right. So if I want to define it separately, I just delete the only.

153
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:04,000
That would be a sample from the marginal probability space.

154
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:13,030
Okay. So with that in mind. So what I have here is, uh.

155
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:22,340
Uh. The CDF of x to evaluate that x minus x one.

156
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:34,750
Right. Because what's what's in there is the probability that x two is less than x minus x one.

157
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:43,430
That's what the inside interval gives me.

158
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:50,570
And then I recall that X1 is also a variable with another integral.

159
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:59,420
So that's going to be in general to go from minus infinity to infinity if it's to.

160
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:09,830
X minus x one. The.

161
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:14,680
Excellent, excellent. Okay.

162
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:23,060
So there is, uh, let's say X1 is absolutely continuous.

163
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:34,480
With respect to the bad. The measure of one.

164
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:45,940
Can be represented as zero dawn nicotine derivative or simply the pdf of x one.

165
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:52,830
Times the bank measure. Which is excellent.

166
00:23:56,970 --> 00:24:07,740
So then under this condition I can write that is integral minus infinity to infinity if it's two.

167
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:13,080
It's minus six for all times the pdf.

168
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:23,300
Well, that's one. And the next one.

169
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:30,940
It could be discrete or nicks discrete, continuous.

170
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:38,570
So we had a lecture that showed us how these integrals would look like in either case.

171
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:44,330
So if it's a mixed, discrete, continuous, there will be a component that looks just like this one.

172
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:56,230
Plus the sum of. Uh, six things generated by the delta functions that we would present the PDF with.

173
00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:07,810
Okay. So and it's totally symmetric, so I can actually switch x one and x two.

174
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:12,979
Yeah. So there are two ways to write this convolution.

175
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:17,030
Of course I can have. And then an integral over.

176
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:24,500
Uh. It's one I would aim to grow over x two.

177
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:28,160
So in this case. So I would still have this line.

178
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:36,090
But instead of filling the area under the line with verticals, I would feel it with horizontals.

179
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:38,250
Right. Like this.

180
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:57,170
And the points on the line would then be represented is x, y equals x minus x two and the area will be x one less than x minus x two.

181
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:05,590
Right then my inner integral, my outer integral will be over x to uh,

182
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:12,440
from minus infinity to infinity and given x to I will integrate over horizontal lines.

183
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:16,670
So that would be the integral over x1 instead of x x2.

184
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:26,140
So note in body symmetry.

185
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:35,580
So it's. One.

186
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:43,730
They switched with X to. Same for.

187
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:56,730
The arguments. The go.

188
00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:03,790
But thanks to the grill. Excellent.

189
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:16,490
Okay. So this construct is called a convolution.

190
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:49,570
So if we're. Now.

191
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:53,950
We wrote it in a cumulative form. Um.

192
00:27:54,070 --> 00:28:00,950
But if both. It's one and it's two.

193
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:11,780
Absolutely continues. I can actually differentiate over.

194
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,660
Over X to get a PDF.

195
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:30,260
Of the. So that's a derivative.

196
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:43,720
Of the. Back to ex.

197
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:53,120
Right. And my f z is given by this formula and differentiating over x.

198
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:59,249
So I have X here as a parameter. It does not participate in integration.

199
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:03,330
That's an external parameter and under some conditions.

200
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:11,160
So in case I have an integral with infinite limits, uh, so it takes uh uh.

201
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:16,379
So the assumption is that the integral of the absolute value under the integral

202
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:22,350
converges is under that assumption I can interchange integration and differentiation,

203
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:28,170
then I'll differentiate effects to X and that would give me a PDF under the integral.

204
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:40,800
So this is perhaps the more familiar form for convolution where it's about the PDFs instead of the CDF.

205
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:47,010
So that's going to be efforts to. Of the six one.

206
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:53,060
That affects one. The swan.

207
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:59,360
The swan. This is probably a more familiar expression for the convolution.

208
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:06,050
And again, because of the symmetry. So one and two can be switched in this relationship.

209
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:17,850
Okay. So then the example of convolutions.

210
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:32,540
So we will later have the so-called central limit theorem theorems.

211
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:36,970
So they are based on statistics that are sums. Friend.

212
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:44,560
The variables like the sample mean. So I have x one plus x two plus and so on.

213
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:55,620
So in general. Countable. The sum of our countable set of variables of sequence members.

214
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:06,820
Um. Right. So then. SEAL these sample means.

215
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:16,950
Related to sample means is low of large numbers of different kinds.

216
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:22,260
So this comes later than, like I mentioned, measurement.

217
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:35,230
There are models. Where I have a covariance.

218
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:46,430
This is the observed covariance. It's the.

219
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:55,140
And it's equal to x plus epsilon where x is the true covariance value.

220
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:25,200
And this is the area to. So then I have a kind of illusion of the pdf for the x axis continues on the pdf for they are a term that is usually normal.

221
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,830
Now this notation for convolutions in this context.

222
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:47,010
So if I have. And distribution of Z so it's written is the distribution of X convoluted so star with the distribution of absolute.

223
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:58,730
And elsewhere. It's not specific to the measurement theory examples.

224
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:06,500
It's in general. Notation for the convolution them.

225
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:14,090
So out of my own research I can help introducing the example of a diagnosis.

226
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:22,290
For chronic disease or later chronic disease.

227
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:36,850
Such as cancer. So latent means unobserved.

228
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:46,380
Or possibly unobserved, I should say. Right. So the story with cancer.

229
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:54,840
Uh, so if I have, uh, somebody born in a certain year,

230
00:33:55,170 --> 00:34:05,610
right within the age of zero and I have a life line like this, then at some point, uh, I have cancer.

231
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:13,530
Starts. But when it starts, it's not feasible.

232
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:24,540
And when cancer starts generating symptoms, or when I do a diagnostic test later on, I will have the diagnosis.

233
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:34,030
Said Which. Point cancer becomes apparent.

234
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:39,780
Right? Yeah. And then I can write the page.

235
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:52,250
At diagnosis. Which is the only thing I observe in this context.

236
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:57,800
Because I don't observe while Kansas is growing and not generating symptoms.

237
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:07,549
So this is equal to two random variables.

238
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:13,160
So one is the time to the onset of cancer.

239
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:29,620
So what age concept? This is an age where cancer starts and it starts in the preclinical form where it doesn't generate symptoms.

240
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:45,620
So it's age, it's consent. Plus and this is the time, uh, measured on the scale of the cancer itself.

241
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:55,220
So it's the time it takes cancer from the start to grow to a size when it would generate symptoms or be detectable using a diagnostic test.

242
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:59,870
So this I would call progression cancer progression time.

243
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:09,160
So then this would be last progression time.

244
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:19,330
Now I don't observe the age of consent. I don't observe the progression time.

245
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:22,930
I observe the some of them. So that generates.

246
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:28,060
So if I put a model on the first random variable and the second random variable,

247
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:32,020
then what I observe as a distribution is a kind of evolution of the two.

248
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:39,370
And this from simple two incredibly complicated models that.

249
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:47,850
Address this phenomena. Especially when you have complicated diagnostic procedures.

250
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:54,730
They are designed to actually reduce the progression time.

251
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:59,950
Actually, a better word here would be not the progression time but the soldier on time.

252
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:10,910
In this context. So that's another term for that piece.

253
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:15,910
Especially in the context of screening tests.

254
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:31,910
Okay. So with this we and the convolution story and this will be new theorem so it becomes from this point on it becomes our instrument in the.

255
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:38,980
Structuring the models and writing model associated distributions.

256
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:46,290
So we start new topic. Convergence.

257
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:55,809
Like I said, we so our statisticians,

258
00:37:55,810 --> 00:38:07,209
we primarily need to characterize the properties of estimate because estimate those are random variables they have done for finite samples.

259
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:15,990
So they indexed by the sample size. So my estimate is thought of as being a sequence of the increasing sample sizes.

260
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:21,190
And I want to characterize where this sequence being random converges to.

261
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:27,009
Right. And there are two concepts that are central to the characterization of estimates.

262
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:39,040
So one is uh, uh, the uh, convergence of the estimates to a fixed value and uh, which is called consistency, right?

263
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:49,290
And so in that scenario, uh, in our topic we will consider more general scenario is a sequence of random variables can converge.

264
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:59,140
To another random variable, not necessarily a constant, but in the context of consistency it would be convergence to a constant.

265
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:03,820
So that other convergence to actually around the variable.

266
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:08,320
That's another concept related to characterizing properties of estimates.

267
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:16,030
That's their starting distribution. So namely when we have consistency in our estimate converges to the true value.

268
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:20,380
So we want to know what's the asymptotic distribution of that statistic.

269
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:25,570
So we normalize it in such a way that it doesn't converge to a constant.

270
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:32,620
It starts converging to around the variable, which is the general case of convergence, right?

271
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:37,570
So in general sequences of random variables converge to random variables.

272
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:44,080
And that sounds when this is the case and some proper normalization.

273
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:52,090
So that limiting random variable will have a distribution that we will call asymptotic distribution.

274
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:58,980
Right. So we're basically looking at the situation that I have a sequence of random variables, X and.

275
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:13,070
And goes from one to infinity. And I'm interested in X and as a sequence converging in some sense.

276
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:24,400
In general to around the variable accidents that will be called the limit.

277
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:33,880
So both are in general in the variables X in the context of consistency in some other situations.

278
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:41,990
Can be a constant.

279
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:47,630
Or. That we will understand there's a degenerate.

280
00:40:52,280 --> 00:41:00,920
The variable. Okay.

281
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:08,870
So let's define. So we already have definitions that floated around this course.

282
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:12,970
Uh. I can just restate them.

283
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:20,140
So X and, uh, we'll be converging to X, almost surely.

284
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:26,670
Yes. And those two infinity. When?

285
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:34,450
An of the surge is.

286
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:43,520
And goes to infinity to x of Omega. For any army girl.

287
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:53,890
Except perhaps. Instead of measure zero.

288
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:11,450
Now, just like we discussed before. So we actually to be rigorous, we need to write almost truly well, a piece of specific measure.

289
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:16,610
But most of the time, this would just be the bag measure.

290
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:33,900
And if we don't write PE, truly that means we mean it as a measure.

291
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:41,490
Now the convergence like these, this is just the calculus.

292
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:52,120
Convergence. With Ahmed being fixed.

293
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:04,790
Economic speed stake sale of omega and ex of Omega.

294
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:08,360
Just some numbers in general on the real line.

295
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:14,030
So I have a sequence of numbers converging to another limiting number.

296
00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:22,400
Right. So and we can restate that.

297
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:33,410
So is this part of this where convergence is taking place has a measure of zero, then that means.

298
00:43:35,790 --> 00:43:40,710
So except for measure zero. Right. Then, then the set up on it is.

299
00:43:42,930 --> 00:43:50,440
When extended Health Canada converges to acts of long ago.

300
00:43:54,760 --> 00:44:00,290
Has a probability. Of one, right?

301
00:44:00,290 --> 00:44:09,740
It's a compliment of that, uh, set of natural zero where this is presumably not taking place.

302
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:15,400
Right. Or we can write it. Uh. In a more concise form.

303
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:34,160
So the probability that this convergence is happening is equal to one.

304
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:45,419
Yes. And goes to. Okay.

305
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:49,890
And another one is we will see a weaker form of convergence.

306
00:44:53,390 --> 00:45:02,740
Will be called convergence in probability. And this is.

307
00:45:04,130 --> 00:45:30,840
Ask the virgins. And the notation for it will be X and goes on probability to x.

308
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:55,560
So the idea is so if if Exxon approaches X as a random variable, then so deviations of exam from x should become increasingly unlikely.

309
00:45:55,740 --> 00:46:04,150
So. That's kind of a wordy intuition behind convergence and probability.

310
00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:16,210
Of X and from x. Increasingly unlikely.

311
00:46:30,350 --> 00:46:34,669
Women and girls to finish. Right.

312
00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:46,160
So if we want to put this sentence in formal mathematical notation, so likely or unlikely, that's a probability.

313
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:54,380
Right. So increasingly unlikely. This probability is going to be going to zero is and goes to infinity.

314
00:46:55,820 --> 00:47:04,160
Then deviation can be in either, uh, x and uh from either side of x.

315
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:11,540
So there's an absolute value of x and minus x, and a deviation is when it's greater than epsilon.

316
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:20,360
And this is supposed to go to zero as it goes to infinity for 86.

317
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:32,310
Absolute. Greater than zero. So that's a mathematical definition of convergence and probability.

318
00:47:35,790 --> 00:47:43,080
And so using the definitions from calculus.

319
00:47:43,530 --> 00:47:47,490
So these are just numbers, right. So those probabilities indexed by.

320
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:54,510
So I can call them Excel is a sequence of numbers.

321
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:09,740
And they certainly did Panamax the Epsilon, even though they have some of these arbitrary and fixed in this expression.

322
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:16,290
So I will indicate that dependance by. Putting it in brackets.

323
00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:27,360
So I basically have that sequence of numbers converges and goes to infinity to another number that is zero.

324
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:35,000
And numbers are negative, of course, because they are probabilities.

325
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:40,200
It's a negative sequence of numbers converging to zero.

326
00:48:42,090 --> 00:48:45,960
So if we want a graph of that, so it could be something like this.

327
00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:57,300
I'm going to zero rates. This is an.

328
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:01,600
One, two. And so on. And this is excellent.

329
00:49:02,830 --> 00:49:09,110
So. So for every epsilon, this is a little the picture would be a little different.

330
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:14,120
But overall, so they would be approaching the asymptote.

331
00:49:17,590 --> 00:49:26,390
So if I have these numbers being monotonic, for example, for whatever reason, then convergence would be guaranteed, right?

332
00:49:26,590 --> 00:49:32,290
Because it's a tiny sequence bounded from below. That would have a limit.

333
00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:42,850
But in general, it's it may not be the case if my points keep jumping up and down without converging to an S.

334
00:49:42,950 --> 00:49:46,690
And so that's when convergence and probability would not be happening.

335
00:49:48,770 --> 00:49:54,350
So let's say. Let's give a couple of alternatives.

336
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:15,149
Alternative definitions. So I think back of calculus and recall how convergence of sequences of numbers was defined and there was an absolute delta,

337
00:50:15,150 --> 00:50:18,600
the language, if you remember there.

338
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:24,290
So I can say. Using this language.

339
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:35,880
So it's not an alternative definition. It's just a reformulation with spell out.

340
00:50:35,930 --> 00:50:39,110
What does it mean that a sequence of numbers are just two zero?

341
00:50:40,510 --> 00:50:43,810
So Epsilon was arbitrary. That's a given, right?

342
00:50:44,350 --> 00:50:56,770
That's an external thing. And then so instead of the Calculus Epsilon, I will have a Delta Epsilon was already a used notation.

343
00:50:56,890 --> 00:51:00,610
So for any epsilon in Delta, greater than zero.

344
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:09,910
Now the AI should be able to find a number and such that.

345
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:19,660
My probability of x and minus x greater than epsilon.

346
00:51:19,670 --> 00:51:34,200
So this is just my x and number. He's going to be less than double the rate for the rest of the ants in the tale.

347
00:51:43,410 --> 00:51:45,470
Right. So sequence of numbers has a limit.

348
00:51:46,990 --> 00:51:57,140
Uh, well, uh, for any given delta greater than zero, I can cut off the tail and, uh, uh, cut off the beginning of the sequence.

349
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:04,490
And I will find that all my numbers in the tail are less than this delta.

350
00:52:04,650 --> 00:52:08,510
Right. So the existence of such a point. 49 point.

351
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:14,340
Defines the. Limit. Right, because?

352
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:20,880
Because Delta is arbitrary number. It can't be as close to zero as I want.

353
00:52:26,130 --> 00:52:32,130
Now, I can also say that so far all the numbers in the table are less than zero,

354
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:42,540
less than delta than super over and greater than an X and of epsilon is less than.

355
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:54,400
Delta. You could say it's less or equal delta, but it doesn't matter whether this inequality is strict or not strict.

356
00:52:56,950 --> 00:53:06,420
Now also from calculus. An equivalent statement would be, um, so sequences have a limit.

357
00:53:11,490 --> 00:53:16,690
His numbers. Of limits.

358
00:53:23,650 --> 00:53:39,730
If and only if you know the name soup, not the calculus name soup of numbers rather than sense is equal to Liam Ian's and is equal to the limits.

359
00:53:43,290 --> 00:53:48,090
So in my case, I have non-negative numbers.

360
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:53,650
And I have the limit equal to zero.

361
00:53:57,140 --> 00:54:03,680
And Liam Soup in general is greater equal than Ian's.

362
00:54:05,210 --> 00:54:12,050
And if this is equal to zero, then it's enough for me in my specific case.

363
00:54:13,490 --> 00:54:19,460
When X and the grades are equal. Zero and the limits of X and.

364
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:25,540
He's zero. Then.

365
00:54:26,950 --> 00:54:30,400
It's enough to simply say that noodle soup.

366
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:37,560
All expense of epsilon is equal to zero.

367
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:44,670
Seven Against Infinity. So that's another alternative statement for.

368
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:50,579
What it means, right? It's just a reminder.

369
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:56,380
So this is probability X and minus X greater than.

370
00:54:56,580 --> 00:55:00,510
So. So limb soup of that probability.

371
00:55:07,210 --> 00:55:10,610
And goes to the scene of disability, which he.

372
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:21,010
He's zero. So that's another formulation.

373
00:55:22,450 --> 00:55:29,290
So I have one like these. We have the Epsilon Delta.

374
00:55:30,670 --> 00:55:39,910
That's why I'm like these. We have a definition.

375
00:55:42,190 --> 00:55:54,100
It's like these. So these are all equivalent statements for convergence in probability.

376
00:55:58,110 --> 00:56:03,200
Okay. Let's have a break. We'll do the same for the truly.

377
00:57:25,570 --> 00:59:32,820
So. That's call it here.

378
00:59:34,140 --> 00:59:48,380
Yeah, that's. So in general.

379
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:53,360
Right. So this is just a general thing, right? That X is a limit of accept.

380
00:59:56,060 --> 01:00:03,110
In calculus when this is the case then. So the call to live in and is equal to x.

381
01:00:03,750 --> 01:00:09,920
Yeah. But in our case we're talking about the limit of zeros for the numbers.

382
01:00:10,910 --> 01:00:15,500
When the limit is zero, then it's limb.

383
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:18,830
So people tuned in eons in equal to zero.

384
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:26,360
But because the slope is always going to equal, the means of soup is equal to zero,

385
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:30,320
then the means is also equal to zero because my numbers are non-negative.

386
01:00:31,010 --> 01:00:34,180
So both are negative. Right.

387
01:00:34,220 --> 01:00:43,610
So it's enough to just stay. So when the limit of a sequence is zero, it's just the lives and the members of the sequence.

388
01:00:43,610 --> 01:00:47,559
Some are negative. Its name super equals zero.

389
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:54,280
That defines that limit. Not the quality of the tool, as they call it, is simply a consequence of this.

390
01:01:04,050 --> 01:01:07,880
To Exxon or not. So this is just an index to this.

391
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:16,100
So I have a Z as an integral. Right.

392
01:01:16,220 --> 01:01:20,940
This is. This is one of the is it.

393
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:30,860
And I'm taking the the default. But that's. No excuse.

394
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:35,050
Right. It's just a number. Uh, yeah.

395
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:43,910
Just so exclusive value of Z. Right.

396
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:51,229
Because this whole thing right as you look up there, it's a city of Z and it has an argument.

397
01:01:51,230 --> 01:01:55,610
That argument does X. And Z is not the joint marriage.

398
01:01:55,630 --> 01:02:00,420
It was just the sum of 614626. You very. Right.

399
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:05,550
I should probably get demoted by the. That would be better.

400
01:02:16,430 --> 01:02:28,639
Okay. Shall we continue? So the reason why I'm going over the different versions of the definitions and what follows,

401
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:35,270
I will go over the different, the corresponding different versions of the complement definitions.

402
01:02:35,270 --> 01:02:35,500
Right.

403
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:45,740
So what does it take, for example, for example, convergence probability to X and what does it mean that X and does not convergent probability to x?

404
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:52,260
So I want to have one lecture with all of these in the same place.

405
01:02:52,260 --> 01:03:01,100
So a couple of lectures because later on we will be proving certain facts about the relationship between those convergences and so on.

406
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:10,850
Right. And sometimes in the proof you need a specific version of a statement of convergence in probability or in the proofs by contradiction.

407
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:16,290
What it means that one variable does not converge to another.

408
01:03:17,170 --> 01:03:30,870
Right. So I'm basically preparing for those proofs and that's why I'm stating different versions of the definitions and the complement definitions.

409
01:03:31,830 --> 01:03:38,550
Okay. So we've got all the possible definitions for convergence and probability, so they are all equivalent.

410
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:44,610
Then we can do the same thing for the almost true convergence.

411
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:50,280
So this is actually in a sense easier because almost true a convergence is straight.

412
01:03:51,300 --> 01:04:00,900
I guess it's not easy, it's just the same, right? So for convergence and probability, we are used to calculus type of convergence.

413
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:08,860
He's right. Because those countless numbers were probabilities of deviations greater than epsilon.

414
01:04:09,860 --> 01:04:16,060
Uh, they can almost draw. Convergence is defined as a calculus convergence in the first place.

415
01:04:17,150 --> 01:04:22,180
Uh, with some strings attached regarding the on, I guess where that takes place.

416
01:04:23,410 --> 01:04:27,880
Uh, so we can use the Epsilon language.

417
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:42,440
From Calculus. So we could say that for any Omega except perhaps a set of measures zero.

418
01:04:56,020 --> 01:05:09,649
Zero. For any epsilon greater than zero I can find and such that so my tale deviations

419
01:05:09,650 --> 01:05:19,130
from the limits and that is for the when on it is fixed x and minus x of omega.

420
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:26,800
Less than Epsilon will be for any member of the tail.

421
01:05:35,540 --> 01:05:39,650
Now, again, it doesn't matter whether you streak down on the street in the qualities of this.

422
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:55,900
Now I can also say for any epsilon greater than zero that it exists and and such that so if every member in the tale is less than absolute,

423
01:05:55,990 --> 01:06:01,090
then the soup is going to be less than Absalom or also equal Absalom.

424
01:06:02,150 --> 01:06:09,000
Okay. Great. Go. And. Okay.

425
01:06:09,460 --> 01:06:15,690
I like the. Five. And they have so.

426
01:06:26,590 --> 01:06:33,210
Now if. Yes, I am looking.

427
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:36,810
So let's say. I have.

428
01:06:36,810 --> 01:06:40,260
Why? And it's equal to so.

429
01:06:42,310 --> 01:06:50,130
And. Okay. Greater than and.

430
01:06:52,830 --> 01:06:58,890
It's okay. Minus X.

431
01:07:07,050 --> 01:07:12,450
Less than Epsilon. Now.

432
01:07:12,660 --> 01:07:15,660
What can we say about the way AM?

433
01:07:20,780 --> 01:07:27,850
Long less than excellent. So these are all functions of Omega.

434
01:07:31,750 --> 01:07:47,320
That's being fixed, right? But what I see here is that what I am is essentially a decreasing sequence.

435
01:07:51,430 --> 01:07:55,620
In a non street sense. So not increasing.

436
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:08,560
The soup has taken over a smaller and smaller set of indices.

437
01:08:19,370 --> 01:08:31,190
So then an equivalent definition would be that Y and actually down to zero is and goes to infinity.

438
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:45,350
With Y defines as a soup over the table.

439
01:08:47,910 --> 01:08:53,890
Yeah. With all the strings attached. Right. So for every Amiga.

440
01:08:53,970 --> 01:08:58,510
Except perhaps. This sentence, measure zero.

441
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:16,520
Okay. So then let's write it in terms of events.

442
01:09:17,390 --> 01:09:27,620
So I will say that Ian is going to be a set of it is such that the deviation is greater.

443
01:09:33,540 --> 01:09:45,980
Then Epsilon. And then I will have a compliment, as I said of the such that the degree.

444
01:09:52,020 --> 01:09:57,790
It's less than that. Right.

445
01:09:58,120 --> 01:10:05,470
So what the definition, uh, tells me is that, uh.

446
01:10:07,020 --> 01:10:13,770
That eventually all the compliments compliments is when it's less than absolute.

447
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:22,620
Right. So my whole tale, starting from Capital M, is filled with events that are happening, right?

448
01:10:24,730 --> 01:10:36,250
When events are defined as less than absolute. So the equivalent definition would be so A and complements.

449
01:10:38,870 --> 01:10:50,670
Ah. Oh, happening. For each of them and.

450
01:10:54,980 --> 01:10:57,980
And for every army they accept, perhaps.

451
01:11:15,210 --> 01:11:20,670
What does it mean? So if the army goes when this is not the case, they have a measure zero.

452
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:27,740
So that means the measure.

453
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:40,540
Of the event when this is happening. He's one.

454
01:11:47,030 --> 01:11:59,450
So that's another definition. Now I can do a compliment statement as well, and here I will write probability.

455
01:12:01,470 --> 01:12:09,120
Liam Ian's. And the compliments, compliments, it's actually zero.

456
01:12:10,140 --> 01:12:15,090
And if I use the rules of compliments, I will have learned so.

457
01:12:17,470 --> 01:12:27,840
This team belongs to the unity of. So this is another.

458
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:38,030
Definition. Okay, then, uh, so we can.

459
01:12:42,460 --> 01:12:46,180
Comparing the convergence.

460
01:12:52,010 --> 01:12:55,490
With convergence and probability.

461
01:13:07,780 --> 01:13:11,050
So this is the event. And as we defined it.

462
01:13:11,770 --> 01:13:13,570
Deviation greater than epsilon.

463
01:13:15,230 --> 01:13:25,550
Now I have limited scope of the probability of p m is zero and that was for one of the definitions for convergence and probability.

464
01:13:29,820 --> 01:13:46,410
So it's convergence in probability two X is one specific case was limb so and the goes to infinity probability of E and.

465
01:13:48,220 --> 01:14:05,460
He is zero. And it's and going almost surely to X and one of the equivalent destinations is that probability.

466
01:14:07,570 --> 01:14:11,500
So it goes to infinity.

467
01:14:13,050 --> 01:14:16,370
8 a.m. He's equal to zero.

468
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:28,540
Okay. So when we looked at the correspondence between Lim soap as defined for science and Lyn soap that defined for numbers,

469
01:14:29,230 --> 01:14:33,460
we noticed that the a certain sense of equivalence.

470
01:14:33,910 --> 01:14:37,980
So we have yet another illustration to that.

471
01:14:38,770 --> 01:14:46,809
Uh, because what changed is the, uh, so we switched links, open the P right.

472
01:14:46,810 --> 01:14:52,930
And in the first case this was Lyn, so related to calculus numbers which are these probabilities.

473
01:14:53,350 --> 01:14:59,010
And in the second case it's Lyn so related to sense, both of them are zero.

474
01:14:59,020 --> 01:15:03,670
So that's kind of intuitively a sense of equivalence between them.

475
01:15:03,940 --> 01:15:12,190
But actually the almost truer statement is stronger than the, uh, convergence in probability statements.

476
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:19,000
Right, because they can make probabilities go to zero, uh, kind of easier.

477
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:27,899
Then I can make a probability of a mean soup of cells equals zero and we'll have a formal statement.

478
01:15:27,900 --> 01:15:31,830
Do that is a theorem that, uh, holds true.

479
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:35,710
Convergence is stronger than convergence in probability.

480
01:15:37,030 --> 01:15:45,360
But before we do that. So later.

481
01:15:48,950 --> 01:15:54,760
We will show. That's.

482
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:02,070
Convergence in two acts.

483
01:16:02,090 --> 01:16:08,870
Almost sure he implies convergence of X and x and probability.

484
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:18,550
And we will have some additional conditions that will show the other in the other direction.

485
01:16:19,330 --> 01:16:26,979
So because convergence in probability is weaker, so it needs additional conditions to ensure true convergence.

486
01:16:26,980 --> 01:16:32,320
And one of the useful conditions is not the necessity of the sequences we will see later.

487
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:41,240
Okay. So that's it for today. Complement statements next time.
