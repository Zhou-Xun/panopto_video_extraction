00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,100
Hello. My name is Tom Braun and

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,170
welcome to the first
lecture of this course.

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:05,700
This lecture will discuss

4
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,250
introductory concepts
involving exposures,

5
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,385
outcomes, and
supporting variables.

6
00:00:11,385 --> 00:00:14,910
Now, great public
health starts with data

7
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:16,560
and there was a whole
language that we

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,540
use when we talk about data.

9
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,370
The data terms and
concepts that I

10
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:22,260
explained in this module can be

11
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,310
used to help us tell

12
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:26,715
the story of the public's
health every day.

13
00:00:26,715 --> 00:00:29,450
Now, the learning
objectives of this lecture,

14
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:32,600
I describe the concepts of
an outcome variable and

15
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,720
exposure variable and
a supporting variable,

16
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,460
then to examine those concepts in

17
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,710
public health contexts and to

18
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:41,030
apply those concepts to

19
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:44,905
actual summary headlines that
we see in press releases.

20
00:00:44,905 --> 00:00:47,630
Now, I went ahead and went
on the Internet and found

21
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:49,130
some press releases to show you

22
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:51,095
an example of a public
health headline.

23
00:00:51,095 --> 00:00:52,670
The first comes
from Science Daily

24
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:54,230
and it said high childhood

25
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:58,550
BMI is linked to obesity
at age 24 in women.

26
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:00,530
The second headline coming from

27
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:01,970
the same source
states that boys with

28
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:03,710
social difficulties are most

29
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:06,395
susceptible to early
substance abuse.

30
00:01:06,395 --> 00:01:09,460
The third example states
that exercise may

31
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:13,110
prevent heart attacks in
otherwise healthy people.

32
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:15,520
Now, all three of
those headlines came

33
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,320
from a set of data and in

34
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,210
basic terms most datasets will

35
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:21,250
have one of three
components in them.

36
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,485
The first is an outcome variable

37
00:01:23,485 --> 00:01:26,965
and the outcome variable
is the end of the story.

38
00:01:26,965 --> 00:01:28,840
It describes what happened to

39
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:34,620
each person or perhaps it
describes what each person did.

40
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:38,350
The other variable in
exposure variable is

41
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:41,320
the beginning of your
story and it states

42
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,090
what is done to each
person or was done

43
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:44,950
to each person or it

44
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:46,660
might say what the
initial experience of

45
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:49,870
each person was before
you collected their data.

46
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:52,070
Every other variable in

47
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,990
your data set will
be considered as

48
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:55,550
supporting variable and these are

49
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,740
variables that are in
the middle of the story,

50
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:00,230
they are a description
of each person in

51
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:03,139
your data set which
include demographics,

52
00:02:03,139 --> 00:02:05,525
opinions or other experiences

53
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:08,590
that the individuals
in the study had.

54
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:11,420
Most public health research is

55
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,640
interested in describing
how the exposure

56
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,130
variable and the outcome
variable are related

57
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:19,130
to each other as highlighted
by the black arrow.

58
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:21,680
However, individual exposures and

59
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,530
outcomes often have
complicated relationships that

60
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:26,180
are often impacted by all of

61
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,695
the other supporting variables

62
00:02:27,695 --> 00:02:30,395
that you might see in your data.

63
00:02:30,395 --> 00:02:34,610
As an example, a very common
public health example is

64
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:36,590
how smoking as an exposure is

65
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:39,545
related to lung
cancer as an outcome.

66
00:02:39,545 --> 00:02:41,600
Now, we know that everyone

67
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,250
who has lung cancer
is not necessarily

68
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,140
a smoker and not everyone who

69
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:48,155
smokes develops lung
cancer in their future.

70
00:02:48,155 --> 00:02:50,270
This is because the relationship

71
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,250
between smoking
and lung cancer is

72
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,155
impacted by many other features

73
00:02:54,155 --> 00:02:56,825
of the individuals
such as their age,

74
00:02:56,825 --> 00:03:00,400
their gender, or
their occupation.

75
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,960
As a second example,

76
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,140
we have an exposure of
substance abuse and how it

77
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:09,440
relates to the outcome of
depression and individuals.

78
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,390
Again, these two variables have

79
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:13,430
a complicated relationship that

80
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:15,560
may be impacted by
other characteristics

81
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,935
of the individuals
such as their race,

82
00:03:17,935 --> 00:03:20,925
whether they smoke
and how old they are.

83
00:03:20,925 --> 00:03:22,695
Now, in this example,

84
00:03:22,695 --> 00:03:28,025
you can see that smoking serves

85
00:03:28,025 --> 00:03:30,500
as a supporting
variable whereas in

86
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,875
the first example smoking
was an exposure variable.

87
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:36,440
So I highlight this to emphasize

88
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,570
that depending upon what
your research question is,

89
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:40,265
a variable can play
a different role.

90
00:03:40,265 --> 00:03:41,555
It could be an exposure,

91
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:43,145
it could be a supporting variable

92
00:03:43,145 --> 00:03:44,870
or it could be an outcome,

93
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,370
but certainly it can only serve

94
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:49,775
one role in any one
specific question.

95
00:03:49,775 --> 00:03:51,785
As a third example,

96
00:03:51,785 --> 00:03:53,930
we have an exposure
that is lung cancer

97
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:56,750
and how it relates to an
outcome of bankruptcy.

98
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,520
These two variables also have

99
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,200
a complicated
relationship that could

100
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,424
be explained also by the
occupation of each individual,

101
00:04:03,424 --> 00:04:06,940
how old they are, and
their marital status.

102
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,080
Again, in this example,

103
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,795
lung cancer now serves as an
exposure in this question,

104
00:04:12,795 --> 00:04:14,675
whereas in my original example

105
00:04:14,675 --> 00:04:16,910
lung cancer serve the
role as an outcome.

106
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:19,640
Again, highlighting that
a variable can play any

107
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,780
of the three roles depending
upon what your question is.

108
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,290
Now, let's return to the three

109
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:25,415
headlines that I showed you

110
00:04:25,415 --> 00:04:28,745
earlier and apply these
concepts to these headlines.

111
00:04:28,745 --> 00:04:30,830
Now, the first stated
that high childhood

112
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:34,310
BMI is linked to obesity
at age 24 in women.

113
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,960
In this example here,

114
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,970
my outcome is BMI,

115
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:43,125
specifically high
BMI is my outcome.

116
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:47,130
As the headline states,
it's linked to obesity

117
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:49,730
and so obesity here
in this example

118
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:51,900
serves as my exposure variable,

119
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:55,130
but the association
between BMI and

120
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:59,540
obesity is related to a
specific group of individuals.

121
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,940
So age serves the role as

122
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:05,185
a supporting variable
as does the gender,

123
00:05:05,185 --> 00:05:08,435
in this example this story
is specific to women.

124
00:05:08,435 --> 00:05:11,540
So we have to supporting
variables in this example.

125
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,070
In my second example,

126
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,810
boys with social
difficulties are most

127
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:18,160
susceptible to early
substance abuse.

128
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:24,040
My outcome is early
substance abuse.

129
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,840
We arrested in how
this outcome is

130
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,375
related to having
social difficulties.

131
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:30,620
So in this example,

132
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,420
social difficulties now serves as

133
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:34,850
my exposure and in
this story here

134
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:36,705
the relationship between
this exposure and

135
00:05:36,705 --> 00:05:39,515
this outcome is specific to boys,

136
00:05:39,515 --> 00:05:42,275
so that whether someone
is a boy or girl

137
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:45,770
serves as a supporting
variable in this headline.

138
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:47,600
In the last example,

139
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,340
exercise may prevent
heart attacks

140
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:52,060
in otherwise healthy people.

141
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,980
The outcome in this story is

142
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:58,090
whether or not someone
experiences a heart attack.

143
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:04,180
The exposure of interest is
whether someone exercises,

144
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:06,440
and again in relationship between

145
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,510
exercise and heart attacks is

146
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:11,449
specific to a subset of people,

147
00:06:11,449 --> 00:06:14,045
whether or not they
are otherwise healthy.

148
00:06:14,045 --> 00:06:16,250
So being otherwise healthy

149
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:21,140
is a supporting variable
in this third headline.

150
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:24,680
Now, understanding the concepts
of exposures outcomes and

151
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,910
supporting variables are very

152
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:28,280
important in public
health research.

153
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,110
However, the question is,

154
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:32,120
can you now identify
them in what you

155
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,250
might call your own real data?

156
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,390
So for a given research
question that you have,

157
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:38,750
can you identify
what variables play

158
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:42,636
the roles of exposure,
outcome, and supporting?
