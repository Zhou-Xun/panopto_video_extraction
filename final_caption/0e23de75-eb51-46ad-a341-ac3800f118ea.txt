1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,089
In this session, we'll learn about recombination and

2
00:00:04,089 --> 00:00:06,198
the concept of linkage studies.

3
00:00:06,198 --> 00:00:11,214
Learning objectives include articulating the concept of a linkage study,

4
00:00:11,214 --> 00:00:16,386
describing the molecular basis of recombination between loci on a chromosome

5
00:00:16,386 --> 00:00:20,872
and identifying recombination and non recombinant or parental gametes.

6
00:00:21,339 --> 00:00:24,977
First, let's review recombination in meiosis.

7
00:00:24,977 --> 00:00:29,567
Remember that the process of meiosis is the process by which a cell in

8
00:00:29,567 --> 00:00:31,911
the body divides to form gametes.

9
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,041
Remember that in each cell you have one chromosome from each parent.

10
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:41,785
Here we're showing the chromosome that you got from your dad in blue and

11
00:00:41,785 --> 00:00:44,727
the chromosome you got from your mom in red.

12
00:00:44,727 --> 00:00:48,415
Remember that in meiosis each chromosome replicates.

13
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:54,251
So it makes two copies and these copies are called homologous chromosomes.

14
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:59,791
In this example, we're just showing one of the chromosomes.

15
00:00:59,791 --> 00:01:04,730
So for example, chromosome one from dad and chromosome one from mom.

16
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:05,990
Each of them replicates.

17
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:11,441
You have the homologous pair of chromosome one in the cell.

18
00:01:11,441 --> 00:01:14,201
These homologous chromosomes pair up at the midline.

19
00:01:14,201 --> 00:01:18,931
And remember it's at this point that there can be recombination of the genetic

20
00:01:18,931 --> 00:01:22,741
material between the paternal and the maternal chromosomes.

21
00:01:22,741 --> 00:01:26,185
The homologous are pulled apart into daughter cells and

22
00:01:26,185 --> 00:01:29,994
then each of the homologous chromosomes is separated again so

23
00:01:29,994 --> 00:01:33,961
that you have one copy of each chromosome in each of the gametes.

24
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:39,152
Here you can see that because of the recombination process,

25
00:01:39,152 --> 00:01:43,896
you have two gametes that have a combination of originally maternal and

26
00:01:43,896 --> 00:01:49,060
paternal material that would be cells two and three, gametes two and three.

27
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:54,748
And then you also have gametes that only have maternal material

28
00:01:54,748 --> 00:01:58,374
like this red one and paternal material for example.

29
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:03,200
Let's take a closer look at crossing over a recombination.

30
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,920
So here you have a picture of the homologous chromosomes.

31
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:12,920
We'll say in this case red is the maternal and white is the paternal chromosomes.

32
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:18,184
Remember that what happens molecularly is that these chromatids or

33
00:02:18,184 --> 00:02:22,537
a single copy of the chromosome one for example breaks.

34
00:02:22,537 --> 00:02:30,255
And the break points should be at the same location on the chromosome in each copy.

35
00:02:30,255 --> 00:02:34,985
So for example, there's a breakpoint here on the maternal chromosome and

36
00:02:34,985 --> 00:02:37,397
the same breakpoint on the paternal.

37
00:02:37,397 --> 00:02:43,440
There's a crossing over and the chromatids rejoin to complete the crossing over.

38
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,559
And so at the end of the crossing over phase

39
00:02:46,559 --> 00:02:49,958
the homologous chromosomes look like this.

40
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:52,930
You've got maternal and paternal material on some of these.

41
00:02:52,930 --> 00:03:00,000
And for example, just one parent's genetic material on some of the chromatids.

42
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,600
These are then separated.

43
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:06,180
And here you can see each of the gametes will get one of these chromosomes.

44
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:11,593
And again, the way that this crossing over happened where you had to break points

45
00:03:11,593 --> 00:03:16,770
on different chromatids, you can end up with for example, genetic material

46
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:21,889
that comes from both of the original parents like these three chromosomes.

47
00:03:21,889 --> 00:03:24,731
Or you can end up with a chromatid or

48
00:03:24,731 --> 00:03:29,443
a gamete that just has genetic material from one parent.

49
00:03:29,443 --> 00:03:35,528
And how these end up depends on where the crossing over happens and

50
00:03:35,528 --> 00:03:38,080
how many of them there are.

51
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,094
Okay, so the concept of linkage studies is actually using

52
00:03:43,094 --> 00:03:48,214
information about recombination to study either the order

53
00:03:48,214 --> 00:03:53,360
of the genes on chromosomes or the distance between genes.

54
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,535
And I'm saying genes are kind of generally because the concept of linkage studies

55
00:03:58,535 --> 00:04:03,274
really originated when people were trying to look at genes specifically.

56
00:04:03,274 --> 00:04:08,507
But we actually can look at the linkage between any two locations on a chromosome.

57
00:04:08,507 --> 00:04:13,670
And in genetics we call locations on a chromosome loci.

58
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:18,472
So we can look at genetic linkage between any two loci on chromosomes.

59
00:04:18,472 --> 00:04:23,550
And we can determine the order of those loci and the distance between them.

60
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:29,274
The distance is measured by a genetic distance or

61
00:04:29,274 --> 00:04:32,339
a recombination probability.

62
00:04:33,052 --> 00:04:38,440
This was a concept that was first discovered in Drosophila or fruit flies.

63
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:44,393
And you can see it was quite a long time ago that this was first developed.

64
00:04:44,393 --> 00:04:46,906
And there's a nice history about it.

65
00:04:46,906 --> 00:04:52,535
But essentially it was used to study the mapping of genes on chromosomes and

66
00:04:52,535 --> 00:04:53,715
fruit flies and then extended to humans to try to identify

67
00:04:56,822 --> 00:05:00,873
the location on chromosomes that were causing diseases.

68
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:06,057
So let's take a closer look at how recombination can lead to parental and

69
00:05:06,057 --> 00:05:08,570
recombinant haplotypes.

70
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:13,559
So recombination as you know, occurs during meiosis between homologous

71
00:05:13,559 --> 00:05:17,184
chromosomes and it's a relatively random process.

72
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:21,659
So there's approximately equal likelihood that it will occur at any location on

73
00:05:21,659 --> 00:05:22,658
the chromosome.

74
00:05:22,658 --> 00:05:28,086
That's not entirely true, but we can talk more about that in a minute.

75
00:05:28,086 --> 00:05:34,150
Here I want to focus on what happens when we look at two loci on a chromosome.

76
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:37,667
So here you've got two homologous chromosomes in orange,

77
00:05:37,667 --> 00:05:41,831
the maternal chromosome, and in purple, the paternal chromosome.

78
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:48,184
If you have a situation where you've got different alleles on these two

79
00:05:48,184 --> 00:05:53,944
chromosomes, you might be able to see where a recombination event happened.

80
00:05:53,944 --> 00:05:58,524
Here we're looking at a place, let's say that this is a snip.

81
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:02,573
And on the maternal chromosome, this person had a big a allele and

82
00:06:02,573 --> 00:06:06,267
a big B allele at a second snip later down on the chromosome.

83
00:06:06,267 --> 00:06:10,949
And on the paternal chromosome, the person had a small allele at nip one, and

84
00:06:10,949 --> 00:06:14,421
later down the chromosome, a small B allele at snip two.

85
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,120
Let's say that there was no crossing over between these two loci.

86
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,771
If that happened then the gametes that this person would make

87
00:06:24,771 --> 00:06:28,698
are either gonna have A at snip one and B at snip two.

88
00:06:28,698 --> 00:06:32,484
So that was their maternal version of the chromosome or

89
00:06:32,484 --> 00:06:35,539
they'll have a a snip one and a b at snip two.

90
00:06:35,539 --> 00:06:37,453
And that was the paternal version.

91
00:06:37,453 --> 00:06:40,921
All of these gametes we call parental or

92
00:06:40,921 --> 00:06:46,930
non recombinant because there was no recombination between them.

93
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:53,190
And so all of the gametes look like one of the original chromosomes from the person.

94
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:58,650
There was no recombination that we can see between these loci.

95
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:03,843
However, if you have a situation where there's a recombination between

96
00:07:03,843 --> 00:07:08,700
these two loci like here on two of the sister chromosome chromatids,

97
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,810
one from mom and one from dad.

98
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:15,153
And then the crossover event happens the gametes that

99
00:07:15,153 --> 00:07:19,120
this person would make are AB which is parental.

100
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,059
That's her maternal chromosome.

101
00:07:22,059 --> 00:07:27,053
Ab which is recombinant because it has maternal material including

102
00:07:27,053 --> 00:07:31,520
the big alien and paternal material including the b.

103
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,841
Recombinant where they have a a from the paternal and

104
00:07:35,841 --> 00:07:41,053
a B from the maternal or ab which is also a parental chromosome.

105
00:07:41,053 --> 00:07:46,625
And so what we would say is that we can look at these gametes and

106
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:52,440
we can say, hey this is a parental or a non recombinant gamete.

107
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:57,193
We can't see recombination between these two loci because

108
00:07:57,193 --> 00:08:02,621
the alleles that the person has looks the same as the original cell.

109
00:08:02,621 --> 00:08:07,549
And then these we call recombinant loci.

110
00:08:07,549 --> 00:08:12,110
There is a relationship between recombination and physical distance.

111
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:17,490
So here we're looking at the distance in center organs.

112
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:19,920
This is the genetic distance.

113
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:25,499
And the distance in mega basis which is the actual physical distance.

114
00:08:25,499 --> 00:08:32,211
So mega bases are the number of millions of DNA basis on the chromosome.

115
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:38,191
And the centimorgan is a measure of genetic distance which represents a 1%

116
00:08:38,191 --> 00:08:44,007
probability that there will be a recombination between those two loci.

117
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:50,042
So this plot is looking at the relationship between those two metrics.

118
00:08:50,042 --> 00:08:54,130
The actual physical distance and the genetic distance.

119
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:55,965
This is chromosome 12.

120
00:08:55,965 --> 00:09:01,721
You can see here that there are about 35 mega bases at the start of the chromosome.

121
00:09:01,721 --> 00:09:06,607
And then there's the centromere, and then there's about 100 mega bases after that.

122
00:09:06,607 --> 00:09:10,972
So this is the short arm of the chromosome 12 and this is the long arm.

123
00:09:10,972 --> 00:09:16,141
And here, this is plotting the genetic distance from the centromere.

124
00:09:16,141 --> 00:09:17,435
So here's the centromere.

125
00:09:17,435 --> 00:09:21,567
And we can estimate the genetic distance or

126
00:09:21,567 --> 00:09:27,781
the probability of recombination starting at the centromere.

127
00:09:27,781 --> 00:09:32,061
And we can estimate that sort of pieces along the chromosome,

128
00:09:32,061 --> 00:09:34,621
small pieces along the chromosome.

129
00:09:34,621 --> 00:09:38,591
And then we can add up the genetic distances to estimate,

130
00:09:38,591 --> 00:09:40,339
these really long arms.

131
00:09:40,339 --> 00:09:45,561
So if the genetic distances ten centimorgan, that means

132
00:09:45,561 --> 00:09:52,431
the recombination occurs between those two loci about 10% of the time.

133
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:58,617
Obviously we have this genetic distance of 140.

134
00:09:58,617 --> 00:10:02,814
It doesn't mean that there's recombination 140% of the time.

135
00:10:02,814 --> 00:10:06,511
It just means that we can kind of map along the chromosome.

136
00:10:06,511 --> 00:10:10,090
Okay, from here to here is about 10% recombination and

137
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:13,690
from here to here is about 10%, here to here is 10%.

138
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:18,442
And we can just add those distance metrics to get the total

139
00:10:18,442 --> 00:10:22,006
number of centimorgan on the chromosome.

140
00:10:22,006 --> 00:10:26,473
Okay, so here we're looking at the relationship,

141
00:10:26,473 --> 00:10:30,948
as I said, between physical and genetic distance.

142
00:10:30,948 --> 00:10:34,762
There is a bit of a difference between males and females.

143
00:10:34,762 --> 00:10:38,261
So females tend to recombine more often than males.

144
00:10:38,261 --> 00:10:40,535
They have a higher recombination proportion.

145
00:10:40,535 --> 00:10:45,163
That's because when the gametes are forming, when eggs are forming,

146
00:10:45,163 --> 00:10:50,024
those two homologous chromosomes sit at the midline, joined together for

147
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,595
a long time in females.

148
00:10:51,595 --> 00:10:57,755
So that happens the eggs start to develop before the female is even born and

149
00:10:57,755 --> 00:11:04,130
then the egg doesn't finish mitosis until the female is grown up and ovulate.

150
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:08,895
And so those chromosomes sit at the midline and in the crossing over state and

151
00:11:08,895 --> 00:11:12,111
there's more opportunity for them to cross over.

152
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:18,220
So let's look at the sex average line here.

153
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:22,850
So you can see that as the position gets further and further away.

154
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:27,240
The recombination distance also sort of tracks with that.

155
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:33,592
So, you know, we we can use a very loose estimation of one centrum organ is

156
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:40,049
approximately one mega base of actual physical distance on a chromosome,

157
00:11:40,049 --> 00:11:44,280
although it varies by if you're male or female.

158
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:48,504
And it also varies if you're close to the central here where where combination

159
00:11:48,504 --> 00:11:49,976
doesn't happen as often or

160
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:54,171
way far away from the central here where a combination happens more frequently.

161
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:56,980
Okay, so let's look at this one more time.

162
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:00,560
If you consider two genes or too low sign in the chromosome.

163
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,509
You can determine whether the gamut transmitted is non recombinant has

164
00:12:04,509 --> 00:12:07,630
the same haplotype as one of the parental chromosomes.

165
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,671
Or recombination has a haplotype.

166
00:12:09,671 --> 00:12:12,830
That's a combination of the alleles on the parents to chromosomes.

167
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:15,860
So here just to look at it a different way.

168
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:19,610
But here's mother's two copies of chromosome one.

169
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:25,230
There's a recombination event or multiple recombination events that happen.

170
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:30,540
And the possible chromosome ones that that mother can transmit to their

171
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:35,421
offspring via gametes are going to be for example small a small B.

172
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,940
Which is parental, AB.

173
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:43,821
Which is parental or Ab aB.

174
00:12:43,821 --> 00:12:45,410
And so these are recombination.

175
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:50,407
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna use how often we see recombinant

176
00:12:50,407 --> 00:12:56,011
haplotype to estimate the recombination frequency between those two lo sai.

177
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:03,757
One thing I want to remind you about is that we can look at segregation of alleles

178
00:13:03,757 --> 00:13:09,070
within a family and we saw this example before with a single Vien tr marker.

179
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:16,221
So remember that we had used the gel to see how long the VNTR was.

180
00:13:16,221 --> 00:13:19,245
So how many copies of the VNTR each person had and

181
00:13:19,245 --> 00:13:23,871
each person remember has a chromosome for mom and a chromosome from dad.

182
00:13:23,871 --> 00:13:28,213
So this person had something from one of their parents with five copies of

183
00:13:28,213 --> 00:13:28,861
the VNTR.

184
00:13:28,861 --> 00:13:32,510
And then one with three copies of the VNTR.

185
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:36,380
Remember that We can use those to look at segregation patterns and families.

186
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:41,357
So this dad had a chromosome was six copies of the VNTR.

187
00:13:41,357 --> 00:13:44,210
And chromosome with four copies.

188
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:47,650
And this mom had five copies and three copies.

189
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:51,778
So when we look at this child who has six copies and three copies,

190
00:13:51,778 --> 00:13:56,671
we know that they must have gotten the six from their dad because he only could

191
00:13:56,671 --> 00:14:00,000
give them a six or a four copies of the VENT R.

192
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,340
And they must have gotten the three from their mom because she could only give

193
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,880
a five or a three.

194
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:09,362
So we can tell which parent has actually contributed which of these

195
00:14:09,362 --> 00:14:11,140
chromosomes to the kids.

196
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:11,298
So the concept of a linkage study capitalizes on segregation.

197
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:21,385
What a linkage study is trying to do is it's trying to look

198
00:14:21,385 --> 00:14:25,020
at multiple markers along the chromosomes.

199
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:30,692
So maybe even markers throughout the entire genome and seeing whether any

200
00:14:30,692 --> 00:14:37,210
of those markers are actually segregating in a family with the disease of interest.

201
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:41,324
So here, for example, you've got a family where,

202
00:14:41,324 --> 00:14:46,559
let's say, this person who's in black here has the disease and

203
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:49,941
the person who's in white does not Right?

204
00:14:49,941 --> 00:14:51,710
So you've got a parent with the disease.

205
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:55,235
And a parent without, let's assume, for example, it's an autism,

206
00:14:55,235 --> 00:14:56,550
a dominant inheritance.

207
00:14:56,550 --> 00:15:01,263
And so this spot here is showing the location of the disease

208
00:15:01,263 --> 00:15:05,974
causing alil this dad has a big deal and a small, a little,

209
00:15:05,974 --> 00:15:11,870
the big deal is causing the disease at the same place on her chromosomes.

210
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:15,730
The mom has two chromosomes that carry a small, a little.

211
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:21,466
Okay, so what we're gonna do is we're gonna look at their Children,

212
00:15:21,466 --> 00:15:23,530
see who got the disease.

213
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:28,395
And then look at other markers along the chromosomes that we don't think

214
00:15:28,395 --> 00:15:33,120
are associated with the disease, but might be linked to the disease.

215
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:33,940
Locus.

216
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:38,370
So let's say that these are each chromosomes here.

217
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:42,041
Okay, This child got a big a little from dad.

218
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:46,083
We know that because he has the disease, this person got a small,

219
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:50,859
a little from dad because she did not inherit the disease, causing a little,

220
00:15:50,859 --> 00:15:54,420
we're assuming complete penetrates here.

221
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:59,760
These kids all inherited as molly a little because they don't have the disease.

222
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,560
And this one has the disease.

223
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:06,670
So the question is, we're gonna measure another marker, let's say.

224
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:12,509
And we're gonna ask if this marker that we're measuring is linked to the gene or

225
00:16:12,509 --> 00:16:16,330
the location that's causing the disease.

226
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:21,671
So let's say this dad has,, a little one and a little too.

227
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:25,371
And the mom has both.

228
00:16:25,371 --> 00:16:26,240
A little one.

229
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:33,812
Okay, let's assume for the moment that we know that the dad is carrying,

230
00:16:33,812 --> 00:16:38,056
that the dad is carrying,, the to lille for

231
00:16:38,056 --> 00:16:42,991
this marker of interest on the same chromosome that

232
00:16:42,991 --> 00:16:47,850
has the big a little that's causing the disease.

233
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:54,940
So he inherited from his mom, say a big A at locust one and a two at locust too.

234
00:16:54,940 --> 00:17:00,760
And from his other parent, he got a small a at locust one and a one at locust too.

235
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,040
Okay, let's look at this child.

236
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,660
He has a chromosome that is big A.

237
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,820
Two and a chromosome that is small A.

238
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:10,875
One. Well, we know that the chromosome small

239
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:15,833
A one had to come from the mom because that's the only kind of chromosome she can

240
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:18,790
give and big A two then had to come from the dad.

241
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:22,711
And if we look at dad's chromosomes, yep, that's a parental chromosome.

242
00:17:22,711 --> 00:17:24,860
We don't see recombination between these two.

243
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:30,233
Los I small A one is also a parental chromosome.

244
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:35,580
Look at this kid though they have Smalley Smalley at the first locust and

245
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,990
a one and a two at the second locust.

246
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,311
Smalley one had to come from mom and

247
00:17:40,311 --> 00:17:44,620
then the one that they got from their dad is small a two.

248
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:48,310
But dad didn't have a small a two chromosome to give.

249
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:52,944
So, you know, there must have been a recombination event between

250
00:17:52,944 --> 00:17:55,530
the a locus and this marker, right?

251
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:57,260
A recombination happened here.

252
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:04,951
So the gammy had the small a from his dad and the two from his mom.

253
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,069
We're gonna use this concept to ask the question is

254
00:18:10,069 --> 00:18:13,560
the disease linked to the marker of interest.

255
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:18,590
And by doing that and testing a lot of markers along the chromosome,

256
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:21,944
we're going to be able to hopefully pinpoint

257
00:18:21,944 --> 00:18:26,641
the location on the chromosome that is leading to the disease.
