1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,990
All right. So my name is Andrea, and I'm in an interview with Dr.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,290
Mr. Patrick, the goalkeeper. Sorry, what happened?

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:13,460
And begin. So welcome to the federal government and managed.

4
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:17,070
What's the name again? My name is Patrick In. All right, perfect.

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:25,679
And so what made you interested in this role? In this job? So what made me interested in playing for the federal government is that I've

6
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,790
already had a number of experiences in the private sector with non-profits,

7
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:34,020
other non government organizations and corporate as well.

8
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:40,860
And government seemed to be a interesting area that I wanted to pursue next in my involvement in my career.

9
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:48,210
And it was something that really drawn to me because I feel like having a broader impact on the UN,

10
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,360
the country, along with the greater scope of the world,

11
00:00:51,360 --> 00:01:02,069
more than just having a very high focused impact on specific areas such as the Here River Watershed Council, which I worked at.

12
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,270
It was a really specific area and I wanted to have a broader scope of my work.

13
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:13,500
SC So you mentioned in your resumÃ© that you worked with the summer camp over the summer.

14
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:15,990
Can you talk more about that? Sure. Yeah.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:25,470
So I had a internship that was required for my master's degree in public health, and I worked at the camp for many reasons,

16
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:30,870
one of which is because of naturally fit within the requirements of my organization working on

17
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:37,020
sustainable development practices and also had some benefits with working in the medical field as well.

18
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:41,429
And so I picked that position because it seemed to fit.

19
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:47,819
And then I just got a tremendous amount of experience there working with kids from ages from 4 to 17 and then working

20
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:54,000
with all of the also younger adults in leadership positions and was also on a startup company type of field,

21
00:01:54,900 --> 00:02:01,320
many of which I had experiences from other student organizations and other companies that I was able to apply

22
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:08,700
myself very well into their organization and be able to hold my own while they were busy working on other things.

23
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,000
I see. And so what do you think is your biggest strength?

24
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:20,290
My biggest strength, one of them that I've seen time and time again is my stress, tolerance and work ethic.

25
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:25,500
So there would be a lot of times in a lot of situations where just things just seemed to be

26
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:30,629
very overwhelming and it just seems like you just can't see the light at the end of the tunnel.

27
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:37,740
And just with patience and persistence, you can just go through and make sure you had everything one thing at a time, one day at a time.

28
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:41,610
And of course, you have to do this as a team. You just can't do anything alone.

29
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:50,660
And so just making sure that you just stay positive and keep on going and having that discipline is one of my key strengths, though.

30
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:57,959
No, that's good, because working at federal government would be very stressful and I'm pretty sure working in a summer camp has

31
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:03,420
definitely helped you with your stress management and tolerance for what you think is one of your weaknesses.

32
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:07,800
So I've really been improving on my weaknesses.

33
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:13,590
Is that three? Okay, we just cut off there. All right.

34
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:20,760
So every time that I identify weakness throughout my career, I always try to immediately fix it.

35
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,860
And sometimes that's not always the best method,

36
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:29,010
because sometimes weaknesses take longer than just like a quick fix or a TED talk in order to overcome them.

37
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:38,459
And so one weakness that I believe I still have is that sometimes I can come off quite intimidating and that can seem project on people,

38
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:43,260
whether it be a threat or just sometimes the way I talk, sometimes the way I carry myself.

39
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:48,090
But there's been time and time again where I just had bad first impressions,

40
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:53,370
whether it be in just getting off on the wrong foot or, you know, just saying something the wrong way or something.

41
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:57,899
But over time, whenever I have more and more frequent contact with the person,

42
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:02,880
I always develop a stronger relationship and always overcome that initial boundary.

43
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,740
And it's very good, actually.

44
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:14,220
And so I guess with that in mind, why do you think we should hire you over 500 applicants who are maybe less frightening for the first preference?

45
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:24,330
Sure. So I think that the diverse experience that I've had throughout my career makes me almost like a very good

46
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:31,679
multipurpose tool when it comes to this position with my finance background and in project management,

47
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,460
and then getting a master's in public health and environmental sustainability and health,

48
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:43,770
and especially with my work experience, there really isn't a problem that I haven't seen yet.

49
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:50,850
And so I think that especially with something as complex as the Federal Government's position with this,

50
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:56,100
that there would be any challenges that would approach me personally or the team.

51
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,760
I feel very confident to get over it knowing that I've had.

52
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:08,260
The experience, and I'm not sure if any other candidate or applicant would have had the amount of confidence and exposure that I've had,

53
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:16,420
I think, for five years. Time's up. Thank you very much. I hope you get hired because you seem like a very capable lady so much.

54
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,200
Thank you very much.
