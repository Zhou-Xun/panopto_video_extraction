00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:10,300
Hello, this lecture will cover inference
for binary and categorical outcomes.

2
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:14,880
It is a sequel to the previous lecture
on the chi-squared test of association.

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,830
In this lecture,
we will extend the previous lecture when

4
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:22,658
we want to compare more
than two populations.

5
00:00:22,658 --> 00:00:27,543
Now the chi-square test of association can
easily be generalized to more than two

6
00:00:27,543 --> 00:00:31,528
populations, whereas the two
sample test of proportions is not.

7
00:00:31,528 --> 00:00:35,852
This is one of the reasons the chi-square
test of association is used much more than

8
00:00:35,852 --> 00:00:38,240
the two sample test of proportions.

9
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,180
We have an example here of
four populations of subjects,

10
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:44,670
based upon their gingival or gum health.

11
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:49,390
We have perfectly healthy subjects, we
have subjects who have mild bleeding, or

12
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:51,240
gingivitis.

13
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,600
We have subjects with a greater
degree of bleeding, so

14
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,780
that they are defined as having
mild periodontitis or gum disease.

15
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,260
And we have a population of subjects
with severe bleeding, and therefore,

16
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:06,600
they are categorized with having
moderate or severe periodontitis.

17
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,000
In these four populations of subjects,
we are interested into knowing whether or

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,990
not also having high levels of
three pathogens in their saliva

19
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:23,330
are related to whether or not they fit
into that group of periodontal status.

20
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:27,630
So again, we have measured the red
complex of p gingivalis, t denticola, and

21
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:30,520
t forsythia in each of our subjects.

22
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,170
In the sample,

23
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:36,640
we have 120 denoted by the lower right
hand corner of the contingency table.

24
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,790
Each subject is denoted by which
group they belong to and whether or

25
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:43,670
not they had high levels
of the red complex.

26
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:47,920
Again, we have 36 subjects, who have
high levels across the four groups and

27
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,680
we have 84 subjects, who have low levels,
among all 120 subjects.

28
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,200
And each of the columns denotes
the total membership in the four groups,

29
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,610
from my four samples.

30
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:05,860
Again, in this table, we can compute the
observed proportions of hybrid complex.

31
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:10,630
In the healthy subjects, there were 50 in
my sample, five of them had high levels,

32
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,650
45 did not.

33
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:14,960
The observed proportion is 10%,
5 out of 50.

34
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,255
And likewise we have observed
proportions of 0.29, 0.53, and

35
00:02:17,255 --> 00:02:22,030
0.65 in the other three groups.

36
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:27,840
So, we see that in fact it appears
that as gingival health gets poor,

37
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,660
the incidence of the red complex goes up.

38
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:36,320
Therefore, we can use these four
proportions to compute odds ratios,

39
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:40,260
comparing each of the groups
to the healthy group.

40
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,890
Therefore, the healthy group will
appear in the denominator of each of

41
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:44,270
the odds ratios.

42
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:47,880
And each of the other groups will appear
in the corresponding numerator of

43
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,570
the odds ratio.

44
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:52,396
To compare the gingival
group to the healthy group,

45
00:02:52,396 --> 00:02:57,552
we compute the odds of the gingival group
as 0.29, their risk, divided by 1- 0.29.

46
00:02:57,552 --> 00:03:02,211
This is divided by the odds for the
healthy group, which is 0.1, their risk,

47
00:03:02,211 --> 00:03:05,719
divided by 1- 0.1,
producing an odds ratio of 3.7.

48
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:07,621
This tells us that the risk,

49
00:03:07,621 --> 00:03:13,810
the odds is 3.7 times higher in the
gingival group than in the healthy group.

50
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:17,240
And we get corresponding
odds ratios of 10.1 for

51
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:22,160
the mild group relative to the healthy
group and an odds ratio of 16.7 for

52
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,800
the moderate to severe group
versus the healthy group.

53
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:33,440
Again, the odds go up as the health
of the patient goes down.

54
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,660
We have corresponding hypotheses again for
the chi-squared test of association.

55
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:43,190
The null hypothesis is now that we have
all three odds ratios being equally 1.

56
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:48,160
This means that red complex has
nothing to do with the four groups.

57
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:54,400
Having a high red complex does not put you
at high risk for poor gingival health.

58
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,330
The alternative hypotheses
is more complex than

59
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:00,610
it was when we only had
a two by two table.

60
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,410
Now we have three odds ratios, so

61
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:07,470
the alternative is that at least
one of these odds ratios is not 1.

62
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:10,400
It could be more than one of them,
it could be all of them.

63
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,750
But at least one of them
must not be equal to 1,

64
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:21,460
meaning that high red complex is related
to risk in at least one of the groups.

65
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:25,610
Again, like we had before, the chi-squared
test of association takes the observed

66
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:30,070
counts in the four by two table,
computes an expected table of counts,

67
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,790
which I have shown here.

68
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:35,490
And it computes the differences,
squares them, divides, and adds and

69
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:39,030
comes up with a total test statistic.

70
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:43,119
In this case, my test statistic is 25.1.

71
00:04:43,119 --> 00:04:47,811
To determine whether or not this 25.1
would be statistically significant,

72
00:04:47,811 --> 00:04:53,470
again, we need to find where this number
lies in a chi-squared distribution.

73
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:58,548
This time my degrees of freedom is 2- 1,
the number of rows minus one.

74
00:04:58,548 --> 00:04:59,560
Times 4 -1,

75
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:04,430
which is the number of columns minus one,
producing three degrees of freedom.

76
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:07,860
Unlike one degree of freedom,
where we knew the critical value was 4 or

77
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:13,080
higher, we do not know the exact critical
value for other degrees of freedom.

78
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:18,370
A computer however, would tell us that
the p value for 25.1 with a chi-squared

79
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:22,500
distribution with three degrees of
freedom produces a very small p value.

80
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,780
And therefore, we have very
strong evidence that the presence

81
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:31,080
of high red complex pathogens is
associated with periodontal health status.

82
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,870
However, this result does not
tell us which periodontal

83
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:36,830
populations differ from each other.

84
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:40,610
There are a total of three odds
ratios we have to consider.

85
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:44,020
Therefore, we could do a chi-squared
test of association for

86
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,460
each of these individual odds ratios, and

87
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:50,310
determine which of these might be
significantly different from one.

88
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:54,200
But because we are now doing
three hypothesis tests,

89
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:59,120
we should use a Bonferroni adjustment,
and multiply the resulting p values by 3,

90
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,631
and compare those numbers to 0.05 in
order to assess statistical significance.
