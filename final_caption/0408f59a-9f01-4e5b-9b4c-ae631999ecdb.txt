1
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:06,161
Patient centred care.

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:12,020
So I think you guys talked about sort of how could that be helpful here.

3
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:15,820
So taking into account patients preferences values.

4
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:19,002
So again the tools that we've used so far have been pretty

5
00:00:19,002 --> 00:00:22,452
basic like just allowing patients to email their providers or

6
00:00:22,452 --> 00:00:26,140
giving them better access to their information.

7
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,229
I tend to think of it as like the Jewish grandma approach to patient centred care

8
00:00:30,229 --> 00:00:34,319
in which there's like a lot of information pushing you don't necessarily want

9
00:00:34,319 --> 00:00:34,830
to hear.

10
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:37,651
And so it's like better than nothing.

11
00:00:37,651 --> 00:00:41,287
But I don't think any of us feel like it's really the world that we want to live in

12
00:00:41,287 --> 00:00:44,002
where you're getting a lot of information pushed at you and

13
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:47,856
then we're calling that patient engagement in the, yeah so I think that's another

14
00:00:47,856 --> 00:00:51,840
area where we have a lot of learning to do around how to actually do as well.

15
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,204
Unfortunately also there's evidence about whether

16
00:00:55,204 --> 00:00:58,440
these unique quality I've done at all.

17
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:03,796
And so sort of the one study that the literature looks at these

18
00:01:03,796 --> 00:01:09,256
each hat measures are sort of like where's your room clean and

19
00:01:09,256 --> 00:01:15,540
things that we think of as like the patient satisfaction members.

20
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:20,805
And I looked at it didn't 10 on whether or not the hospital repeated and

21
00:01:20,805 --> 00:01:24,276
had any HR like across the board no difference.

22
00:01:24,276 --> 00:01:28,623
No HR was better and a bunch of them HR was better than some of the others like I

23
00:01:28,623 --> 00:01:30,767
think this is sort of largely right.

24
00:01:30,767 --> 00:01:34,988
It's not clear that really any of these tools are actually something Asian

25
00:01:34,988 --> 00:01:36,540
transaction.

26
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:41,573
So anyway I mean you know maybe like staff always give patient information

27
00:01:41,573 --> 00:01:46,300
about what to do during their recovery at home is a better job of that.

28
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,812
You can imagine the mechanism there, all right?

29
00:01:48,812 --> 00:01:52,542
The cavity HR they do a better job printing out comprehensive discharge

30
00:01:52,542 --> 00:01:54,860
instructions and giving them to patients.

31
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,940
Like maybe there's something there.

32
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:59,826
But the point is that this is one study we don't know that much and

33
00:01:59,826 --> 00:02:03,300
I think most of us seven cents today that this is not like an area where we really

34
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:06,361
expect to see a lot of movement cuz we haven't really invested yet.

35
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,564
So I think if anyone wants to do take forward a domain of health ninety whether

36
00:02:11,564 --> 00:02:13,952
they're a lot really a lot of opportunity to and

37
00:02:13,952 --> 00:02:17,040
a domain I think it's spacious centred care.

38
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,418
I don't know if you guys had a different experience and

39
00:02:21,418 --> 00:02:27,144
every time I go to healthcare technology but it does, [INAUDIBLE] Okay?

40
00:02:27,144 --> 00:02:30,425
So timely avoiding harmful delays.

41
00:02:30,425 --> 00:02:34,931
So there have been again these are more in the flavour of single institution studies

42
00:02:34,931 --> 00:02:39,043
we don't have a lot of evidence about whether healthy he is helping improve

43
00:02:39,043 --> 00:02:40,050
harmful delays.

44
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:43,771
One study found that CPOE sped up time for

45
00:02:43,771 --> 00:02:48,811
delivery of key medications in an inpatient setting.

46
00:02:48,811 --> 00:02:52,630
So it does seem like it was able to sort of help decrease lazier.

47
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:57,348
And another study that also this came from a single hospital found

48
00:02:57,348 --> 00:03:01,895
that there was with this is automatically alerted that the test

49
00:03:01,895 --> 00:03:06,740
results come back in that it sort of led to more graphic following.

50
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:11,039
So again, these sort of basic common sense things that you can help speed up things

51
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:15,231
if you tell people that there's new information available that need to be had.

52
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,200
But that being said, we also have evidence on the other side.

53
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,205
So this is the same hospital where they found t that information was set up when

54
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:31,672
they used the, System also found that even though everyone had in the 83%

55
00:03:31,672 --> 00:03:37,390
of doctors still said they wish they could see the test result, all right, it's okay.

56
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:42,070
A lot of how do you take this tool and implement it in a way that's effective,

57
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:42,600
right?

58
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,061
You can take the same tool and speed things up, make things slower etcetera.

59
00:03:46,061 --> 00:03:48,092
And there's nothing about the technology itself and

60
00:03:48,092 --> 00:03:50,540
guarantees that these benefits are gonna be.

61
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,048
So again, if you need to just try it,

62
00:03:52,048 --> 00:03:54,940
you will balance that's what the evidence looks like.

63
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:57,031
You can find studies that show that building does things well.

64
00:03:57,031 --> 00:04:02,870
You can also find studies that show that it doesn't happen, [INAUDIBLE] Okay.

65
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:07,701
We also talked about effect on clinician time, sort of just using these systems

66
00:04:07,701 --> 00:04:11,375
take longer to take time away from care that they otherwise or

67
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:15,413
time that they would otherwise be delivering basic patient care or

68
00:04:15,413 --> 00:04:17,320
other important priorities.

69
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:21,567
And I would say largely what the studies have found that in the short term it

70
00:04:21,567 --> 00:04:23,160
absolutely takes longer.

71
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,803
So it takes more time away from the patient care,

72
00:04:25,803 --> 00:04:29,940
[INAUDIBLE] Everything else to use these systems to document in them.

73
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:33,425
And in most studies that at least after about three to six months and

74
00:04:33,425 --> 00:04:35,977
physicians are sort of back to baseline levels,

75
00:04:35,977 --> 00:04:38,483
I can't believe they don't feel a lot faster.

76
00:04:38,483 --> 00:04:43,615
I think we all really suffered, but there's a lot of variation, yeah.

77
00:04:43,615 --> 00:04:46,504
I'm sure all of you have heard storeys when you talk to doctors,

78
00:04:46,504 --> 00:04:48,550
they say that they never recovered, right?

79
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:53,569
Even now a year out, it's still taking them longer when to use it record

80
00:04:53,569 --> 00:04:58,673
versus what they used to do on paper and others didn't versus the average

81
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:04,722
maybe it's neutral, but you can definitely a lot faster, a lot slower, aet cetera.

82
00:05:04,722 --> 00:05:09,409
And again, we just don't have a really good understanding of why that is how do

83
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:14,099
you know why it takes something and not and how help support the implementation

84
00:05:14,099 --> 00:05:19,022
process in a way to make sure that you actually don't get really slow down, okay.

85
00:05:19,022 --> 00:05:24,394
So anyway, so again, it's sort of that I think of it as a mix that, right?

86
00:05:24,394 --> 00:05:28,675
Again, find studies show that faster and some of the times that they got slower and

87
00:05:28,675 --> 00:05:32,085
much of that show that they sort of ended at about the same place and

88
00:05:32,085 --> 00:05:33,161
then they started.
