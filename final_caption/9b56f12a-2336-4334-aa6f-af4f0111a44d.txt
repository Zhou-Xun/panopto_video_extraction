1
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:19,580
Okay. So today we're going to kind of move circle back a little bit to talk about mediation analysis in a principle stratification context.

2
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:29,540
So, you know, we've sort of presented this mediation in this sort of direct and indirect effect modeling idea or idea.

3
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:35,510
So we're going to talk a little bit about how we might approach this in a principal stratification context.

4
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:42,890
I think it'll sort of get in a little bit into these two sort of reigning paradigms, maybe many paradigms around causal inference.

5
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:49,790
And we can kind of see a little bit of of how they work together or how they are a little bit different

6
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:56,630
and maybe a little bit into sort of certain situations where they may be advantageous or disadvantages.

7
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:09,739
So it's kind of dates back a little ways now to a paper from 2004 by Don Rubin,

8
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:14,990
who also was one of the sort of inventors of the the principle stratification idea.

9
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:20,330
And he argued that a form of direct effects, at least can be estimated a principle stratification setting.

10
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:29,600
So the particular focus is on the attempt to treat effects in the principal strata where there's no effect of the treatment on the mediator.

11
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:37,069
So we're sort of back into the situation where we don't allow this sort of cross world thing to go on.

12
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:46,280
We just sort of have the single kind of counterfactual where we can imagine our potential outcome under different treatment values at a prime.

13
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:58,940
And we want a condition on the settings where the effect of the the causal effect of the mediator, the causal effect of the mediator is zero, right?

14
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:04,220
So the difference between a mediator for the outcome of drama and the outcome of the frame is zero.

15
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:13,030
So an example of this and actually this this whole section of that could be sort of papers I was involved in.

16
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:17,470
So they're sitting on them on the drive there.

17
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:27,640
But an example of this considered mediation due to outside therapy in a situation where we're studying

18
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:33,770
the effect of cognitive behavior therapy on depression in a sample of persons that attempted suicide.

19
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:47,800
So and the specifics of this many of these examples are drawn from this from some collaborations at the Veterans Administration,

20
00:02:48,860 --> 00:03:01,210
one of the area when I was at Penn. And so these are settings where we can imagine all four principals treated now.

21
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:11,110
So D here being this this obtaining outside outside therapy.

22
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:25,270
So so compliant mediators would be situations where people went to outside therapy when they were given treatment and not if they weren't.

23
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:34,150
Then there were the always mediators, the people who always sought outside therapy regardless of their treatment status.

24
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:41,530
Than ever mediators. Individuals who never sought outside treatment,

25
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:47,260
regardless of the treatment status and the defiant mediators where individuals sought

26
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:55,210
outside treatment only if they had not were not assigned to the treatment arm.

27
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:09,500
So so in this case. Well, in terms of the modeling, we considered a multimodal logistic model for the principal strata.

28
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:14,410
Right. So conditional on some sort of covariates,

29
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:28,720
you had some probability pie c c of X that defined your probability where for identifying better purposes, we set one of these to zero.

30
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:37,959
Right? So logistic regression, you always have e to the beta axis one plus needed to be an x for that one is basically we have,

31
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:43,510
as you said, all these zero, right? So so I see zero against one.

32
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:48,730
So that that allows us to to identify the deltas.

33
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:56,530
And since we have four potential layers, not two, we will allow for this multimodal model.

34
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:00,730
And then our normal potential outcome connects all of the principal strata.

35
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:12,850
So some potential change associated with the treatment effect, right?

36
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:25,440
So this sort of causal treatment effect, the counterfactual and then some common covariance and the variance that might also depend on on the class.

37
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:31,720
So what if we do not have interactions between A and X here in this model?

38
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,510
So you could you could include. But we didn't.

39
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,390
So. So we'll be monitors monitor this city. In this city.

40
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:58,280
You guys can see that page. So I'm going to bring this up. The Monitor monitors consumption.

41
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:13,550
That's right. No defiance. Right. And this requires a little bit of of contextual knowledge, I guess, but.

42
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:16,350
So remember, in the situation we're in here,

43
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:23,190
we're talking about mediation is where they they the individual seeks outside treatment above and beyond the cognitive behavioral therapy.

44
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:26,970
So can anyone speculate why that might not be reasonable?

45
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:30,290
And so. Yeah, go ahead.

46
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:35,960
They're not being given like any of the number of people who've attempted suicide they're pretty likely to see.

47
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:38,020
Quite possibly, yes. Right.

48
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:44,210
Whereas if they get the cognitive therapy, they may not add substance to the fire, but even more common than the campfire group here.

49
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:51,230
So that the fire, in the sense is is it's kind of just a terminology thing and it isn't necessarily a reasonable assumption.

50
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:56,600
Um, and what would the exclusion restriction be here in the city?

51
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:21,470
But there's not a difference in means based on compliance quite well.

52
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:25,000
Which particular compliance class would that hold in the.

53
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:32,720
Sorry. Sorry. Is it for the non-compliant? Right.

54
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:38,160
So. Well, it would be for the. For the. So for the noncompliance.

55
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,690
For the always mediators and then ever mediators. Right.

56
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:46,860
The idea being that if you don't have some sort of change in mediation, that you're not going to have a change in the outcome.

57
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:56,360
So that's exclusion. But what about for these people? The exclusion restriction wouldn't touch these folks.

58
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,409
Right, because we have a change. But what if we assume that?

59
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:05,670
What are we doing here? Precisely.

60
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,740
We're assuming the way the thing we're trying to test.

61
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:19,890
So we can't really make the exclusion restriction because we want to see what happens when there's no effect of the treatment on the media.

62
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:27,180
So we're assuming away our direct effect, and that's exactly what we want to look at.

63
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:47,909
So we can't essentially make that assumption. So our estimation used a Bayesian method with weak priors to help kind of

64
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:51,060
stabilize parameters that are identified only through distributional assumptions.

65
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:57,120
So it's a little it's a little, little a little shaky from a robustness perspective.

66
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:02,940
But but under those assumptions, we can we can make progress.

67
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:13,070
So our full likelihood looks a little bit like it's a little complicated, but it's basically similar to what we we showed earlier.

68
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,090
We were working on a stratification setting.

69
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:25,140
So for the subjects for which they don't assign treatment, they're assigned a control and they do not seek out additional treatment.

70
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:35,280
So basically that means that they can be either compliant mediators or never mediators.

71
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:42,180
Right. So we know that these zero zero, which means they belong to one of these two stranger.

72
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:56,350
So. So basically it's a mixture of the individuals that are in the compliance strata, right?

73
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:03,670
The probability of being a compliance rater plus the probability that they're in the never sort of

74
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:07,720
never meet either the people that never seek out the treatment regardless of their treatment status.

75
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:19,590
And then for the individuals that are assigned to treatment and seek outside treatment, then again they could be the compliant group, right?

76
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:23,790
Because this is ad1 equals one. Or it could be they always take a group.

77
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:48,520
Losing some fetus here. See? I told status.

78
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:54,240
Oh, right. Because they had zero. Right. So. So in a zero.

79
00:10:55,410 --> 00:11:01,680
Here they is. One way here now for these individuals.

80
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:11,430
Right. So they are people not assigned treatment or assigned to control, but they seek outside treatment anyway.

81
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:15,780
So these could be the always takers or the fires.

82
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:29,830
Right when they had zero. And then when I is one India zero then we're looking at at never takers in the fires.

83
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:38,950
And so these are in opposite directions. But they they did not seek did not seek outside treatment.

84
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:48,740
And then these icy eyes turn have this more binomial loaded form.

85
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:54,260
And of course, this is just the standardized. Then it was reduced.

86
00:11:54,440 --> 00:12:00,380
Right. So we're allowing for potentially different variances, each of which is what is a theta.

87
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:06,500
So theta is effective treatment. So it so right this piece here.

88
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:20,580
So when he is zero, does it appear when he has one? It appears. Okay.

89
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:30,290
So. All right.

90
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:34,440
So. A few little things here.

91
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:41,020
One is we had a sort of a database prior. So this is something you see occasionally in the Bayesian world.

92
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:50,350
It's a it's a bit of a cheat, but a weak one. So we're sort of trying to figure out what are some sort of potential ranges for these betas,

93
00:12:53,320 --> 00:13:05,550
particularly with the more data now is is this treatment effect and then the the control variables which which also can vary by the points.

94
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:13,870
QUESTION So, so we could just try to set this at say zero some very high variance, but we're going to do a bit more to stabilize it.

95
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:20,740
So we're going to center it around the maximum likely to estimate or if we just observed regress the observed Y on an X.

96
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:25,630
So just sort of an overall rough average of where these things are going to be.

97
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:38,080
And then for the for the precision matrix on this, we just take our precision matrix from this regression, but we then multiply it by N.

98
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:44,920
So any idea what this kind of sort of trying to get back out?

99
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:52,830
You can sort of think of this as sort of a representative number of observations.

100
00:13:53,640 --> 00:14:08,420
What would that number be? Consulting it as a precision being divided by hand.

101
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:24,480
The sample variance in the previous. What's the sample varies from this just this the regression of A of y and x, we multiply it by N.

102
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:29,370
So what is that sort of the effective sample size mean that if we multiply it by here.

103
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:42,080
Sort of chew that around a little bit since we can take a guess.

104
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:52,010
But it's. So this Vive Beta had a new beta.

105
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:56,240
I guess we did this observed variance covariance matrix.

106
00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:14,390
How many observations is it based on? Yeah, right.

107
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:24,249
It's just the sample size. So multiply this by n kind of state, it's really the equivalent of the population know, not the population variance here.

108
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:31,270
So smaller variance, more precision. So if I multiply it by n turning it back into something, it looks like maybe.

109
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:48,100
One observation. Okay. Right.

110
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:58,990
So if my variance is based on in observations and I multiply it by n, I've sort of rescale that to be the equivalent of one observation.

111
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:12,330
So conversely, we think of this as a precision and I divide that precision by that precision gets big, gets smaller.

112
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,830
And so that's equivalent again of one observation.

113
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:22,530
So think of the variance of course is shrinking order in.

114
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:30,190
And so by blowing it back up by you and I sort of pushed it back to one. So it's kind of it's a little.

115
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:36,360
You could use other values here, too, if you want to do activations or for right.

116
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:42,580
Using or to enter if you wanted to have an observation.

117
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:49,179
But sort of keeping it to a small number of observations and having it be scaled by the

118
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:58,540
sample size and importantly by doing that kind of keeps the prior from being from the.

119
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:06,160
The goal here is to avoid double counting the data too much. Right, because they're using data or observe data to estimate these.

120
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:10,569
Now we're going to be using this to generate or posterior right.

121
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:15,250
So if we if we did that, we would be in some sense of double counting.

122
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:22,330
But but using the end here kind of avoids that, doing that in any large sense.

123
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:31,930
So it also helps to stabilize the status because we're we're allowing for all the possible categories.

124
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:42,579
Right. So we have no single no single set of I guess in the likelihood you're look at the likelihood there's no single part of the life.

125
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:48,970
There's no part of the likelihood where we can identify specific observation with probability one.

126
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:52,960
So all these things are are mixture components.

127
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:57,310
So having a little bit of stability on this on this prior, this is very helpful.

128
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:11,580
So for the. For the variants prior.

129
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:19,509
This is a little very old school nowadays who often use these sort of have cushy type variances,

130
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:26,980
but generally for there's a fair amount, it should be a fair amount of data to estimate these once we sort of have beta stabilized.

131
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:34,960
So we kind of got away with just enough. This is sort of very flat inverse gamma player.

132
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,549
It's somewhat less than ideal.

133
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:48,459
It tends to push the variance perhaps to be a bit smaller than it would be because it has this kind of spike as inverse chemicals.

134
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,760
200 you get sort of.

135
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:59,130
The large amount of prior distributions spread out over a very wide number of values and that there are many pieces all pushed to zero.

136
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:07,680
So it makes the likelihood look like the prior, but it does it does have this sort of implicit issue.

137
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,490
But for larger samples, it doesn't matter too much.

138
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:17,910
And finally the prior on the delta these.

139
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:37,460
More than normal logistic regression parameters was made basically to look a little bit that was very similar to this

140
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:47,810
prior in the beta in the sense that we basically took the likelihood piece but then raised the power of ten grand.

141
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:55,160
So this this is a suggestion from a paper by Hirano some early work in this area.

142
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:03,500
So here it's kind of like putting sort of ten observations, if you will, in each and each of these.

143
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:15,170
Each of these. Each of these taking the equivalent of ten observations from the from the data one appear.

144
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:19,190
You could use one over N two around of five to rent. So.

145
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:30,050
So it's this is a somewhat complicated structure here on these deltas.

146
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:34,700
There are other other options. One could even do a multi L.M. regression.

147
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:45,860
Based on some sort of crude estimate of these at these things and then flatten that out.

148
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,309
If you don't have the facts here, it's just an intercept, right?

149
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:58,370
So you don't really have coverage predicting these classes then this is just a multi gnomeo and you can use this deer prior.

150
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:02,710
So I think we talked about that in a. Previous example.

151
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:07,000
So, yes, quite. Why is that?

152
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,400
What was that other than taking taken from sequels to 2 to 4?

153
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:26,400
Because we're using when sequels one. So we didn't say, well, you have to pick one value of C to be set to zero to be set to zero.

154
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:32,220
So it's fixed. So I guess we're just picking a compliance class.

155
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:45,360
As that value. And then look at that differences from that to being in that in that class for the always

156
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:50,250
takers versus players for never takers versus players in the defiance versus compliance.

157
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:19,010
So estimation proceeds.

158
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:26,790
We kept sampling very similar. We look at the compliance example which had an intercept and we model for the principal stratum.

159
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:39,030
So basically the probability of being in a compliance class given your treatment assignment, your.

160
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:47,670
Search for outside care. Your depression score and based on covariance.

161
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:59,059
Basically it looks like a mix of the two principal principals.

162
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:02,299
SCHRADER So I didn't write it out one by one.

163
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:05,630
But basically, if you're in April zero it one,

164
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:09,740
it's basically the problem with it being compliant versus and always taken

165
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:19,430
and then the corresponding value of theta phase one and then the covariance.

166
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,189
So. Right. We're doing kip sampling.

167
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:31,350
So we assume we know theta. We assume, you know, sigma C, we think we know gamma and pi.

168
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:36,200
So we're just trying to plug all those in to get this probability of compliance class.

169
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:42,560
Yes. And if you've been doing an intercept only model, we wouldn't have to get that X right.

170
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:49,100
Okay. Right. All right.

171
00:23:49,100 --> 00:24:03,120
So this is the this is the new piece. So for April zero, two equals zero.

172
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:06,450
This is the probability of being a complainer. This would be.

173
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:13,200
I see. And this would be by the. For.

174
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:33,730
An accordion player group equals one. So the probability that sequels to being in an always taker then well that would be zero if these are both zero.

175
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:41,139
Same way for that for the, you know, the sequels for the the fire group or sequels three than this.

176
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:49,940
You just flip this around so this becomes three. And this is one.

177
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:57,290
And then when equals one equals one, you still could be a complainer, but you could also be an always taker.

178
00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:01,490
So he's become one of the 2 to 1.

179
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:06,530
So on and so forth and all. But for different compliance classes.

180
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:18,169
So then to draw Sygma right, we basically get our residuals, right?

181
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:25,700
So check off any effective treatment and then look for the covariates, square those,

182
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:30,740
some of them up within a compliance class and then do an inverse karma.

183
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:38,300
Some squares and then. The observations in that class.

184
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:47,360
And then finally for the drive beta, right?

185
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:56,650
Once we got everybody assigned to a class and we know sigma, then we basically have to compute this.

186
00:25:57,550 --> 00:26:09,970
So. Basically this is the multivariate normal prior and the band is, you know, very normal.

187
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:15,430
Basically, if I had some vector X.

188
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:24,300
You. And that's.

189
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:31,560
So that's some multivariate model with P.

190
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:43,760
So these are vectors. Matrix said that symbols.

191
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:59,590
And then I had a prior and this me data.

192
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:04,860
Excuse me. There were also no.

193
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:15,910
So it's really nice to is unknown to my posterior view given the data.

194
00:27:21,810 --> 00:28:21,550
No mission board. So this is essentially a precision weighted mean.

195
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:28,490
One reason these were only government decisions versus.

196
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:39,570
Right. So we're essentially so X has some precision here.

197
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:48,240
The inverse of Sigma ex IMU has some precision in versus slip IMU.

198
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:52,410
So we're essentially taking the weighted some of those decisions.

199
00:28:55,020 --> 00:29:02,070
And then the precision in the past year.

200
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:26,150
It's. The precision of posterior is the sum of the prior precision.

201
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:57,090
So I actually do have a little bit of. Of.

202
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:03,060
This is a this is a formative prior. So I do have to kind of look at all of these components.

203
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:07,020
So if you look at this with the piece up here.

204
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:19,660
So the sigma is my prayer. And B, the C.

205
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:37,680
And this view subsea is. So there should be a.

206
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:57,809
Should be a subsidy on this. And it be. So the precision for my data, right,

207
00:30:57,810 --> 00:31:03,570
is just going to be the precision from my it's just going to be the inverse of the

208
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:15,870
variance from my regression of the A and the X on the Y in the given compliance class.

209
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:20,950
Right. Which is just going to be this. Make sure this is x,

210
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:27,399
transpose x and verse I've written here so I can sum sum and just do the sums over the CS and can also write

211
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:36,370
that as a sum of the individual vectors excite x like transpose to make the whole matrix and some of those up,

212
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:40,570
but only in the subjects that are assigned to be given compliance class.

213
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:47,200
And so. So that's mine.

214
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:55,300
And then multiply by sigma squared to get my variance and then I take the inverse of that for the precision kind of corresponds to that.

215
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:05,500
And this x2 might be the way to tell the C, right, which is basically my estimate of beta.

216
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,060
It also should have a C in it.

217
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:25,210
And then my prior my beta hat and sigma over all data.

218
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:29,530
So generally this v subsea should be a lot smaller.

219
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:37,210
Than Sigma. So the universe would be a lot bigger.

220
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:42,850
So it would be a lot more weight on this estimate. But there will be a little bit of stabilization from this part here.

221
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:53,460
Okay. So that's basically all the pieces, certainly for the sampler.

222
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:04,780
Questions. No.

223
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:12,200
So. The results.

224
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:22,670
So this overall intent to treat effect kind of keep them in the next slide.

225
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:28,940
Basically, we're looking at the posterior distribution of the intent to treat effects within each

226
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:32,660
of the compliance classes than summed up over the probabilities of compliance class.

227
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:38,179
And look at something that's very similar to just what we did if we just looked directly at the

228
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:49,130
data to estimate a causal effect and then just in on the actual treatment assignment itself.

229
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:58,760
So the standard direct effect with overall sample, basically we got that out of the bear and accounting estimate.

230
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:06,900
So what we have done in that. It's the first Asian American came out.

231
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:42,530
Our mediator here is. Division itself is.

232
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:49,360
But hear. Yeah.

233
00:34:55,580 --> 00:35:14,760
It's version. Someone has to be so very canny model.

234
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:48,500
That's the first thing to impress. Well, somebody in the media.

235
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:07,740
It this a little over a year. And then for the second stage of.

236
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:30,720
Sorry. And maybe.

237
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:46,250
So then. Or react to the fact.

238
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:28,390
The. But it should be.

239
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:32,420
So that's how we got. Any estimate. Probably a Delta method approach for estimating the variance.

240
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:45,080
So then back to this direct effect modeling in this principal stratification context.

241
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:53,060
So we considered a couple of models, one where all the theta C were equal.

242
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,860
You know, and one where the fire group was different.

243
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:13,170
So we had some evidence basically that they the see was quite a bit different in the fire than the others.

244
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:24,960
And then we look at are always mediators or never mediators and then this pool direct effect which.

245
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:35,400
See. Right. Basically it's just looking at the proportion.

246
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:49,090
Of of subjects that are in the always been in a group and the never mediate a group and then looking at the weighted average of that,

247
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:54,070
that treatment effect within those groups. So.

248
00:39:57,210 --> 00:40:00,720
So this corresponds. All right.

249
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:02,670
So there's always been a group.

250
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:16,649
Corresponds to theta to an intermediate, a group corresponds to theta three and the pool of effect corresponds to the theta two plus two theta three.

251
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:20,190
Both are weighted by the probability of being in one versus the other.

252
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:30,830
And then. So not a lot of evidence for campfires in the fires here.

253
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:36,740
Most individuals were never meet her group. And then about half of the remainder were in the hallways.

254
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:41,480
So about 12% were in the other.

255
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:51,860
The other two. Without direct effect estimates, even net indirect.

256
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:58,190
I mean, you're right. You're right. I think that's the indirect effect.

257
00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:02,450
So. So basically we're looking at.

258
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:29,430
We want to correct. So.

259
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:56,590
So there's really not a lot of evidence of effect due to outside treatment.

260
00:41:57,490 --> 00:42:04,570
So basically this direct effect looks very similar to this overall intent to treat effect.

261
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:21,069
So. Now there is maybe a little bit of heterogeneity in the direct effect depending

262
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:27,040
on whether you're looking at subjects that get outside treatment or don't,

263
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:38,160
particularly when we looked at this allowing for possible differences in variances by but by by Principal Schrader.

264
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:44,200
So there's a little bit of evidence that the effect of the CBT is perhaps a little bit

265
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:50,410
stronger in subjects that always sought outside treatment than in subjects that that didn't.

266
00:42:56,110 --> 00:43:01,500
There is some sensitivity to this choice about about the variance structure.

267
00:43:19,090 --> 00:43:28,489
All right. So. All right.

268
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:37,700
So that. So any questions or comments on that?

269
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:48,250
So one thing you can kind of see here a little bit is that when we sort of investigate, we're not we haven't used the word indirect effects as well.

270
00:43:48,490 --> 00:43:52,330
We're really defining them in the same way. But we sort of look to see,

271
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:58,120
is there is there an effect or what effect is sort of through the treatment

272
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:02,310
itself as opposed to other factors that if these things are basically the same,

273
00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:06,160
that that's pretty much the explanation of the rule.

274
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:16,840
So when these things would be different than you would start to see that, we start to see that perhaps this these other pathways may be important.

275
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:27,180
So this next approach was an attempt to kind of work directly with that idea.

276
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:52,000
So it's somewhat similar, except now we're in the setting of a binary meeting or an outcome.

277
00:44:54,010 --> 00:44:59,950
And so our joint distribution of potential mediator and outcome and again,

278
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:07,629
not allowing for a potential outcome to be defined in a manner where the mediator value

279
00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:11,740
can take on a different value than it would have under the actual treatment assigned.

280
00:45:12,850 --> 00:45:27,790
So for the mediator, right, the usual game for first column refers to the outcome of the mediator and under control,

281
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:35,980
then are second to the outcome of the mediator to treatment. We have four different possible patterns kind of correspond to this.

282
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:40,060
Never always comply or in the fire peace.

283
00:45:41,770 --> 00:45:50,130
And then for our outcome again, the same thing sort of implicitly we're assuming from wave of zero.

284
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:54,130
That means d051 is d is one. So.

285
00:45:55,630 --> 00:46:01,040
Again, four possible potential outcomes, right?

286
00:46:01,210 --> 00:46:10,990
Or zero under treatment or control where there's an effect from 0 to 1, from control to treatment,

287
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:23,790
then where it's always a success and then where the treatment goes in the opposite direction.

288
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:32,950
If you think of the treatment as helpful, then it's a situation where the treatment helps your situations, where the treatment has no impact.

289
00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:39,140
And then this is a situation where the treatment is harmful. So.

290
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:47,570
So essentially this is a four by four table right to correspond to each of these different patterns and the potential outcomes.

291
00:46:48,790 --> 00:46:52,090
And summations by rows and columns here.

292
00:46:55,270 --> 00:47:03,110
So if we start sort of sorting out. Different measures of mediation.

293
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:44,190
We have the overall positive effect. Right.

294
00:47:44,540 --> 00:47:55,570
So that's just an old friend. The difference in the potential outcomes averaged over population.

295
00:47:56,810 --> 00:48:04,450
So. Right.

296
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:15,160
So this is the overall rate of weight for the 100 treatment units along our way of life in one.

297
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:33,760
Here is the overall survival treatment for all three, five plus two, five, four, four.

298
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:43,010
All right. So. You could slide back up here.

299
00:48:44,270 --> 00:49:01,190
So. So basically the probability of y equal to one under treatment is basically everybody in these two columns.

300
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:08,750
So that's the pi plus to the pi plus three, the probability of wider control for these two columns.

301
00:49:09,830 --> 00:49:19,880
So it's a pi plus three, plus pi plus four. So when I subtract this from this, it's pi plus three disappears.

302
00:49:20,910 --> 00:49:25,490
I'm just off the pi plus two minus two. Pi plus four. It's not clear.

303
00:49:45,790 --> 00:50:03,740
So then. We finally called the associated effects.

304
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:10,900
80. Basically this was.

305
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:24,980
You think? When the exposure changes in the media.

306
00:50:43,360 --> 00:51:10,690
You know. So basically we want to consider what this difference given that D1 is not equal to D0.

307
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:17,550
And. Is going to be.

308
00:51:52,860 --> 00:52:00,440
It's. So.

309
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:11,500
So basically what's going on here is now I kind of want to play the same game,

310
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:22,030
but only in the rows where there's a discrepancy in the DS under the potential outcomes.

311
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:50,230
So. So basically there becomes these pie to two by two threes, pie for twos and pay for threes minus these pieces here.

312
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:59,010
And then conditioning on being in. One of these two rows.

313
00:53:11,090 --> 00:53:22,690
So this is the way this one would. This is the way it was one treatment group and the second wife was a control group.

314
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:26,110
So I don't subtract these basically these pay three, so it's disappeared.

315
00:53:26,950 --> 00:53:33,900
And so I just have this part here. Paramount.

316
00:54:04,370 --> 00:54:15,320
Finally we decide is this dissociative effect or d the effect when exposure.

317
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:50,690
It's not change. Difference is that we use the term disassociated.

318
00:54:50,710 --> 00:54:54,760
That could possibly be by, for instance, direct effect, you know.

319
00:55:26,670 --> 00:55:37,620
Right. So basically the same thing. But now we're working in the rows where the hasn't changed.

320
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:40,640
So basically the first the third rose.

321
00:55:52,970 --> 00:55:56,950
So it makes sense. Each.

322
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:19,240
All right. So sorry goes back to what I mentioned in the in the previous paper we looked at.

323
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:23,950
So the effect of the exposure is entirely direct. So sort of no mediation 3D.

324
00:56:24,910 --> 00:56:28,390
Then we'd expect all these three values to basically be the same. Right.

325
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:36,340
Does it matter what's going on with the we just get the same causal effect and all of them all the measures.

326
00:56:36,610 --> 00:56:42,610
Right. So socially, in effect, disassociated effect, causal effect, all the same thing.

327
00:56:45,630 --> 00:56:51,870
So if the effect of exposure is entirely media 3D, then we would anticipate this direct effect to be zero.

328
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:59,850
Right? This doesn't change. Why doesn't change? In this case, this associative effect takes on a little bit of a different values.

329
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:12,310
And so. Yeah.

330
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:46,150
Rewrite associate effective zero rewrite probability as expected value of yy0 .00.

331
00:57:52,110 --> 00:57:59,340
Probability zero plus.

332
00:58:15,210 --> 00:58:20,670
Situation there. With one vs zero zero his first one.

333
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:31,350
And so the record is this is such a defensive zero.

334
00:58:32,190 --> 00:58:46,850
It's just. So that just means there's overall effectiveness with this.

335
00:58:48,230 --> 00:58:56,440
So basically that applies. This, of course, is the.

336
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:09,630
This is the assumption effect. As opposed to the overall positive aspect.

337
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:47,640
150. And if we translate that back to our four by four cable.

338
00:59:50,550 --> 00:59:58,660
That's basically. The probability of success and the treatment,

339
00:59:58,660 --> 01:00:09,460
minus the probability of failure of treatment divided by the probability of having either success or failure, if you will.

340
01:00:09,730 --> 01:00:14,570
And the. Meat Eaters said.

341
01:00:22,950 --> 01:00:31,220
Three girls. It's.

342
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:54,030
Okay. So that leads to this suggested mediated effect measure which cause child or Vanderbilt to yell at me.

343
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:59,220
But I still think it has some value.

344
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:54,220
The. So basically.

345
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:16,650
Basically it's this associative effect that is the overall puzzle.

346
01:02:16,650 --> 01:02:23,860
In fact, the variability associated effect if the dissociative effect of zero, I suppose.

347
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:32,320
Okay. So basically it's going to be zero, if all.

348
01:02:33,390 --> 01:02:36,550
Correct. All right.

349
01:02:36,780 --> 01:02:45,360
Because in that case, you're going to see if will become. It's going to be one if.

350
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:59,810
No. Right. Right, because there is no direct effect.

351
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:07,550
This 80 will be this is equivalent to the rest of the year, the zero.

352
01:03:11,260 --> 01:03:18,220
So first, my fears about this are not necessarily constrained between zero and one, right?

353
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:29,340
Because you could have situations where you can understand the nature of exactly how this this conditional probabilities work out.

354
01:03:29,350 --> 01:03:35,440
You could actually get negative or over one, but that you're sort of in a range.

355
01:03:36,730 --> 01:03:40,210
Where do you think mediation might be taking place?

356
01:03:40,930 --> 01:03:50,130
Then what is? So hopefully reduce.

357
01:03:53,220 --> 01:03:56,820
But take it down a little bit here.

358
01:04:40,970 --> 01:04:45,410
Rather general, so should affect the remainder.

359
01:04:52,440 --> 01:05:29,020
I have to switch. And the audience is my baby sitting there and.

360
01:07:15,230 --> 01:07:21,500
So basically what I've done here spread throughout this high place to.

361
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:42,990
When the time comes for peace. They're so pervasive that it happens to both candidates for the nominator.

362
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:42,010
So. So we just have a.

363
01:09:47,310 --> 01:09:53,200
We're multiplying top and bottom by day two plus plus 5.4 plus.

364
01:09:53,220 --> 01:10:02,040
So that turns it into that and then up here and cancel out that there.

365
01:10:05,380 --> 01:10:16,390
So it wasn't total simple solutions, but it actually does simplify quite a bit.

366
01:10:17,260 --> 01:10:24,130
If we assume ethnicity, which depending on the situation as we just saw, may or may not be sensible.

367
01:10:25,240 --> 01:10:28,720
But an example to look at, there is a case for it.

368
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:43,510
So we if we if we have monitors in a city, so we go back, basically that means that this fourth row disappears, right?

369
01:10:43,590 --> 01:10:48,610
The probabilities are all zero. So everything that's pi for something goes away.

370
01:10:50,110 --> 01:10:55,300
So my.

371
01:10:58,710 --> 01:11:13,500
My associative effect then becomes just pie to to overpower to plus direct effect by basically the one minus the.

372
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:20,610
Dissociative. Dissociative affect becomes one minus dissociative effect and immediate effect.

373
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:34,660
You get the. Basically everything involves a four there goes away.

374
01:11:35,940 --> 01:11:43,980
And so we can also think of the mediator effect is looking something like the associated effect in general.

375
01:11:43,990 --> 01:11:56,850
Right. And it's the causal effect that now for is going away.

376
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:06,600
Over this one minus two causal factor, the associated effect when the disassociate effect is zero.

377
01:12:15,020 --> 01:12:24,410
Okay. So. The model is not fully identified, so we can't actually get maximum like good point estimates.

378
01:12:25,490 --> 01:12:28,760
There are however, bounds, at which point the maximum likelihood becomes flat.

379
01:12:29,620 --> 01:12:32,629
We've ever seen those pictures of the American West with the buttes, right.

380
01:12:32,630 --> 01:12:39,920
That come up and are flat on top. That's what this likelihood looks like, but in more than three dimensional space.

381
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:48,050
So you could compute those boundaries and call it a day.

382
01:12:48,860 --> 01:12:55,640
Alternatively, you can use a sort of a Bayesian estimation scheme with proper priors on the on the prize.

383
01:12:58,220 --> 01:13:01,910
So I guess you didn't have this one.

384
01:13:02,180 --> 01:13:06,800
Could have been midterm exam. Could have been worse. I took this one out.

385
01:13:08,930 --> 01:13:17,810
So I guess I should probably realize it now, in addition to how we put that back in into the notes until the exam.

386
01:13:21,110 --> 01:13:27,650
So it's basically basically just work out these two SMOLKIN on this not only the likelihood

387
01:13:28,730 --> 01:13:33,770
and you end up with a bunch of draws for PIs the federal is directly distribution.

388
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:44,710
So if you just put a flat, you can put this sort of corresponds to a flat distribution, sort of one observation out of out of 16.

389
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:47,690
Let's see if you have the full 16 cells.

390
01:13:50,770 --> 01:13:58,540
So the details in this, if you look at the paper, describe how to compute the boundary conditions in the machine city.

391
01:13:59,690 --> 01:14:06,790
Uh, all right. So over time. Okay, so I will stop here.

392
01:14:06,820 --> 01:14:13,450
We'll go through an example of this. It's Monday now because we're Wednesday.

393
01:14:14,110 --> 01:14:19,239
And and finish up this discussion and probably do a little preview a little

394
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:23,740
review of survival analysis so that we can get into the time to invent stuff.

395
01:14:24,820 --> 01:14:33,130
And then then we have a break. We'll talk more about kind of and stuff after we get back to your final day.

396
01:14:35,110 --> 01:14:38,830
Okay. So good weekend, folks.

397
01:14:39,940 --> 01:14:43,920
I'll be around tomorrow for my office hours, so.

398
01:15:19,020 --> 01:15:25,050
I don't know if you're aware, but most of the most of my students haven't taken survival, and I guess I'm aware of that.

399
01:15:25,590 --> 01:15:34,110
But we had that discussion in the clinical trial. So you'll this is too you know, you're not going to do an exam on this, right?

400
01:15:34,230 --> 01:15:39,120
I'm just trying to get, you know, enough to sort of get some of the basic ideas in this course.

401
01:15:39,780 --> 01:15:44,880
Personal analysis, causal inference in survival settings is a little trickier because of the fact that

402
01:15:46,510 --> 01:15:50,730
looking at things over time and that sort of that mediation becomes a big issue.

403
01:15:50,940 --> 01:15:54,750
And so thinking about what you can do so is really important.

404
01:16:23,150 --> 01:16:50,940
Right. Oh, that's got.
