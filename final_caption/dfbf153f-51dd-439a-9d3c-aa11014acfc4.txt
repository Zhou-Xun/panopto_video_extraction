1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:06,600
because I want to now focus in on healthy worker effect

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:12,020
which I think this format is gonna look pretty different. I

3
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:17,560
how much money have to classes how much have you talk about the workers are

4
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:22,720
very little. okay. bye. well that makes sense because

5
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:29,120
usually if you're not on. alright.

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,280
so remind me to stop maybe like six or seven minutes before the class

7
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:39,900
and we'd be able to get Samantha be here. we were way to do that.

8
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:45,220
okay. we'll we'll do that even if we aren't finished which we won't course.

9
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:50,360
alright. 's. 's healthy

10
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:55,420
worker effect H.W. need for those in the know what the definition. it's name is

11
00:00:55,420 --> 00:01:00,580
given to an empirical observation. so this is like over and over again when you look at data. you

12
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:06,177
speed that's what's meant by empirical rights that working populations

13
00:01:06,177 --> 00:01:11,317
tend to have a lower mortality experience in the general population and

14
00:01:11,317 --> 00:01:16,437
in fact if you look at all because standardized mortality ratios

15
00:01:16,437 --> 00:01:21,957
typically they're in the range of maybe as high as ninety.

16
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:27,017
meaning a hundred being a hundred percent. so ninety would be like your nine tenths of

17
00:01:27,017 --> 00:01:32,377
like they did die the next year. the entire US population. but sometimes

18
00:01:32,377 --> 00:01:38,557
as low sixty. so like getting down to where you're only happens like we contact tax

19
00:01:38,557 --> 00:01:43,557
the average for everyone put together including all the other people working but all the people not working.

20
00:01:43,557 --> 00:01:49,137
okay. so

21
00:01:49,137 --> 00:01:54,357
so you can either think of that as a type of selection by right because you could say

22
00:01:54,357 --> 00:01:59,747
well. like to buy healthier individuals are more likely to be selected for employment

23
00:01:59,747 --> 00:02:04,907
it certainly is true for a host of reasons we'll talk about more details or you can think about it as

24
00:02:04,907 --> 00:02:09,987
confounding because cousins finance confounds the relationship of the work

25
00:02:09,987 --> 00:02:16,047
exposure to the disease. because if it's okay with both.

26
00:02:16,047 --> 00:02:21,527
I'll give you a little can't all you can think of it either way. that second way is not

27
00:02:21,527 --> 00:02:26,667
strictly correct which is we got through the whole presentation you see why

28
00:02:26,667 --> 00:02:32,127
I'm saying that in the moment it's probably more a form of selection by.

29
00:02:32,127 --> 00:02:37,307
so usually just hear people talk about healthy worker effect

30
00:02:37,307 --> 00:02:42,387
but there's really three completely independent aspects of

31
00:02:42,387 --> 00:02:47,487
this. that's why it said H.W. be one eight study two and H W

32
00:02:47,487 --> 00:02:52,667
three seventy eight seventy one is the healthy tire which

33
00:02:52,667 --> 00:02:58,665
is you can see it says their newly people newly hired for employment

34
00:02:58,665 --> 00:03:04,465
have a lower age specific mortality than the source population from which they were drawn.

35
00:03:04,465 --> 00:03:10,045
so if you just got hired. if you just got hired in the last year.

36
00:03:10,045 --> 00:03:15,385
you are much less likely to die of various diseases than

37
00:03:15,385 --> 00:03:20,605
average across the entire population of people you know you heard of your same age

38
00:03:20,605 --> 00:03:26,105
race et cetera such. okay. that surprise anybody.

39
00:03:26,105 --> 00:03:31,485
I mean I'm guessing not right because people that are

40
00:03:31,485 --> 00:03:36,705
significantly disabled by some disease that actually

41
00:03:36,705 --> 00:03:41,865
is going to end up causing them to die in the next year. much much less likely

42
00:03:41,865 --> 00:03:46,945
to be hired in for employment. then you're at your average person that's

43
00:03:46,945 --> 00:03:52,125
looks and ask healthy shell that makes I think

44
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:57,517
intuitive sense right. this would be true. okay so that's number one

45
00:03:57,517 --> 00:04:03,477
not healthy worker effect number two is a little bit more subtle. it says it time

46
00:04:03,477 --> 00:04:08,537
set hire in fact is present which is if you look at. so

47
00:04:08,537 --> 00:04:13,917
you look to a group of workers in one facility. that are always forty five

48
00:04:13,917 --> 00:04:18,977
and some of them hired in twenty years ago or even twenty five

49
00:04:18,977 --> 00:04:24,037
years ago and there twenty or twenty five years old and other dogs on only were hired in the last

50
00:04:24,037 --> 00:04:29,037
five years. we're only hired at age forty or later and if you look at the

51
00:04:29,037 --> 00:04:34,137
mortality rate. you compare it now two groups. so

52
00:04:34,137 --> 00:04:39,157
you can. work in a worker rights of the citizens depend on standardization with the population. if you

53
00:04:39,157 --> 00:04:44,357
look at the mortality rates that you're gonna stay very typically almost

54
00:04:44,357 --> 00:04:49,857
without exception. the people are recently hired or gonna have lower mortality

55
00:04:49,857 --> 00:04:55,557
experience in the next year and the people are hired twenty or twenty five years ago. even though

56
00:04:55,557 --> 00:05:00,657
they're all the same age now. age forty five so they buy willing to give me

57
00:05:00,657 --> 00:05:06,037
a reason. logical reason that they think this

58
00:05:06,037 --> 00:05:12,277
is true. life is observed empirically.

59
00:05:12,277 --> 00:05:17,637
okay or something. okay well

60
00:05:17,637 --> 00:05:22,857
known taking and Allstate. what you're gonna say all of that which you think

61
00:05:22,857 --> 00:05:28,317
requires you to be healthier to get someone to decide offer you a job or

62
00:05:28,317 --> 00:05:33,337
just say okay we're not gonna fire you today we'll let you stay on the job maybe not quite as productive as

63
00:05:33,337 --> 00:05:38,797
used to be. so basically the

64
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:44,297
people that were hired last five years and had to pass I higher standard of health

65
00:05:44,297 --> 00:05:49,577
to get it and are less likely it has their health deteriorate quickly.

66
00:05:49,577 --> 00:06:07,715
people are hired twenty twenty five years ago or they helping change quite a bit yet

67
00:06:07,715 --> 00:06:12,955
so it could be that could be going on about what I'm saying is that you wouldn't see

68
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:20,475
what I'm fine healthy worker effect too. even if none of that was going on in other words

69
00:06:20,475 --> 00:06:25,795
if somebody hired twenty years ago they had to be healthy enough to be hired

70
00:06:25,795 --> 00:06:30,875
but maybe there for reasons have nothing to do with anything at work. even stress

71
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:37,673
that where their health is deteriorated over the couple decades and

72
00:06:37,673 --> 00:06:43,173
to the point where if they were coming in fresh off the street. maybe they wouldn't be hired. so as they using were have

73
00:06:43,173 --> 00:06:48,813
too many problems so. so it doesn't really depend on there being anything noxious

74
00:06:48,813 --> 00:07:09,833
in the workplace. you got pay this anyway.

75
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:14,853
okay. so what you talk about is true but I think it's a different issue. 's and

76
00:07:14,853 --> 00:07:19,913
overtime out here because um because that's earliest in

77
00:07:19,913 --> 00:07:25,353
argument of leaving aside women are pregnant just focusing on older people being hired.

78
00:07:25,353 --> 00:07:30,473
just sort of we said argument saying well no it's not true. well no I I

79
00:07:30,473 --> 00:07:36,373
take it back if you have got things and very. yeah that's probably part of us

80
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:41,658
last there. okay so I watch you know that's one thing. healthy worker effect

81
00:07:41,658 --> 00:07:46,938
one has nothing to do with healthy worker effect to why I say that because in

82
00:07:46,938 --> 00:07:54,378
eight study one your time you have you're only looking at newly hired people

83
00:07:54,378 --> 00:07:59,798
and you're comparing newly hired people the general population in in H.W.

84
00:07:59,798 --> 00:08:04,798
two. you're only looking at workers no general population and and the comparison

85
00:08:04,798 --> 00:08:09,918
is between recently hired and hired a long time ago while

86
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:15,758
being the same age so they can't they're not the same thing everyone by that there

87
00:08:15,758 --> 00:08:21,038
they don't event diagram they don't intersects to different and

88
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:26,278
now here comes the most interesting one. what usually very to a healthy

89
00:08:26,278 --> 00:08:31,798
worker survivor fact and which I'm Chinese W

90
00:08:31,798 --> 00:08:37,722
E three and that is the workers to terminate employment

91
00:08:37,722 --> 00:08:43,802
early before the normal retirement age for whatever job Syrian is

92
00:08:43,802 --> 00:08:50,562
experienced increased mortality after leaving work early.

93
00:08:50,562 --> 00:08:56,762
so. so basically I said don't even tell me why you left work early.

94
00:08:56,762 --> 00:09:01,822
impaired population on average. if you left work early. you're considerably more

95
00:09:01,822 --> 00:09:07,622
likely to die the next year. then if you don't leave work early and you're still working.

96
00:09:07,622 --> 00:09:12,622
and of course the problem the reason for that right is that one of the reasons

97
00:09:12,622 --> 00:09:17,682
people leave work early is because they're having significant health problems and maybe they can't

98
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:25,002
even continue to whereas you know if if you can't do it all or we they can't do it very well

99
00:09:25,002 --> 00:09:30,042
and so that's that's a big one that we're gonna have to talk about and think about quite a bit because

100
00:09:30,042 --> 00:09:41,444
that's probably off and he has a big impact. yeah

101
00:09:41,444 --> 00:09:46,924
intentional glass. I don't

102
00:09:46,924 --> 00:09:52,344
think I've ever seen a study focused on that. I mean

103
00:09:52,344 --> 00:09:57,844
I don't know. I'm not sure where you're going with that. I mean there's probably some people

104
00:09:57,844 --> 00:10:02,904
who are become very disabled and decide that they wanna commit suicide and go

105
00:10:02,904 --> 00:10:07,924
on living like this Lisa I'm sure some people like that. I never see anyone focus on

106
00:10:07,924 --> 00:10:13,204
that. okay. alright so there's the three components

107
00:10:13,204 --> 00:10:18,324
and you know it's a Shelly 's. rate has nothing to do with the first two

108
00:10:18,324 --> 00:10:23,624
because now you're comparing people say of the same age where they've all been workers

109
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:28,964
and once once said people continues his workers another set of people retires early.

110
00:10:28,964 --> 00:10:36,744
so if you have something different one and two. okay.

111
00:10:36,744 --> 00:10:42,172
so that was all hot for Connie that there's

112
00:10:42,172 --> 00:10:47,392
three times a healthy worker effect now we're gonna talk about disease specific healthy

113
00:10:47,392 --> 00:10:52,572
worker effect so not like died from anything now gonna talk about dying

114
00:10:52,572 --> 00:10:57,652
from specific diseases or types of diseases and so what sounds again it's

115
00:10:57,652 --> 00:11:02,812
an empirical observation is the healthy worker effect is much more

116
00:11:02,812 --> 00:11:07,872
marked and chronic debilitating diseases diseases which tend

117
00:11:07,872 --> 00:11:12,892
to progress rapidly and heart disease is given as an example

118
00:11:12,892 --> 00:11:17,932
of a chronic debilitating disease. not it's true are some people that

119
00:11:17,932 --> 00:11:23,012
as far as I know I've never had any heart problem and they have a massive my

120
00:11:23,012 --> 00:11:28,572
party on Clarkson and fall over dead before they eat you know EMTs can even reach them.

121
00:11:28,572 --> 00:11:33,952
that does happen to some people but that's not that's not the common

122
00:11:33,952 --> 00:11:38,992
way people experience heart disease is much more comments that they're having problems and

123
00:11:38,992 --> 00:11:44,026
typically last years before they may eventually died guards around

124
00:11:44,026 --> 00:11:49,066
the heart disease. okay. so it does make sense to call a chronic debilitating disease

125
00:11:49,066 --> 00:11:54,446
and of course there's different cancers but on average cancers

126
00:11:54,446 --> 00:11:59,546
tend to be much for rapidly progressive depends what can't you're diagnosed with you know if you're if

127
00:11:59,546 --> 00:12:04,966
you're diagnosed with something like pancreatic cancer or something like

128
00:12:04,966 --> 00:12:10,966
melon almost started metastasized or even most lung cancer

129
00:12:10,966 --> 00:12:16,386
a year. there's a very strong probability that you'll be you'll have died within two years

130
00:12:16,386 --> 00:12:22,706
of your diagnosis are other other cancers that people live long time that I average

131
00:12:22,706 --> 00:12:28,846
cancers tend to be rapidly progressive. you're not sick for that long

132
00:12:28,846 --> 00:12:33,946
before you actually end up dying from them. okay you don't feel sick. you can't

133
00:12:33,946 --> 00:12:39,926
be identified. so money one.

134
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:44,990
give me a what they believe is an explanation for this. observation I would

135
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:50,050
just be true. so I when I'm telling you is if you look at cardiovascular disease. it's

136
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:55,170
a typical population. let's keep the keep things clear for the moment but soon there's nothing

137
00:12:55,170 --> 00:13:00,290
that work. it's detrimental. okay. even even psychological at work. so it's

138
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:05,690
at the working population. nothing in the workplace is depositing

139
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:10,690
any kinda disease not causing it. but if you look at what

140
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:16,346
that seminar for heart disease in that working population that's comparing the population

141
00:13:16,346 --> 00:13:21,746
to the total general US population you're likely to find something

142
00:13:21,746 --> 00:13:26,946
typically like sixty you know sixty percent is likely to die of cardiovascular

143
00:13:26,946 --> 00:13:32,406
disease sometimes the lower fifty five even fifty percent even only half and five

144
00:13:32,406 --> 00:13:37,586
and if you look at all cancers bar typical

145
00:13:37,586 --> 00:13:43,566
it's something eighty five even ninety. certainly at least eighty. meaning that

146
00:13:43,566 --> 00:13:48,706
there's a healthy worker effect for both but it's much stronger for the heart disease. much

147
00:13:48,706 --> 00:14:04,326
more apparent that it is for the cancers. yeah

148
00:14:04,326 --> 00:14:09,446
I'm not I'm not sure that the statement you made is really true. I mean like you know with the mate

149
00:14:09,446 --> 00:14:17,769
what's the leading cause of lung cancer behavior

150
00:14:17,769 --> 00:14:24,069
well to see that I do I passion from New Orleans and the thing about pancreatic cancer

151
00:14:24,069 --> 00:14:29,129
is it is present very late. usually by the time people get that you know

152
00:14:29,129 --> 00:14:34,869
if it doesn't cost symptoms to look at very big and bad. so usually by the time

153
00:14:34,869 --> 00:14:40,829
people have symptoms sort of to wait for most people he treated

154
00:14:40,829 --> 00:14:46,449
different reasons for different ones. okay. so

155
00:14:46,449 --> 00:14:51,489
other thoughts on that. why you think this is alright. let me change

156
00:14:51,489 --> 00:14:56,509
it around. so here's my question. I I just told you about cars of

157
00:14:56,509 --> 00:15:01,969
Jesus compared to most can't imagine to individuals

158
00:15:01,969 --> 00:15:07,169
one of them is destined to die at age fifty five. cardiovascular

159
00:15:07,169 --> 00:15:12,709
disease. other is destined to die at age fifty five it's a

160
00:15:12,709 --> 00:15:18,849
lung cancer. okay and and they're now both

161
00:15:18,849 --> 00:15:23,969
fifty years old. not fifty five years old. so they're so you know this is like

162
00:15:23,969 --> 00:15:29,249
now we got where you can predict the future. the future is that in in in

163
00:15:29,249 --> 00:15:34,429
in fact all the people could die at age. are going to die at age fifty

164
00:15:34,429 --> 00:15:39,749
five from there two different diseases. so that John here's a question ask to yourself

165
00:15:39,749 --> 00:15:44,929
which one of those two at age fifty is more likely to be at work.

166
00:15:44,929 --> 00:15:50,989
for.

167
00:15:50,989 --> 00:15:56,249
ones are gonna be of it and yeah

168
00:15:56,249 --> 00:16:01,389
most people because lung cancer tends to be rapidly say it all gets tired tends to get diagnosed

169
00:16:01,389 --> 00:16:06,529
late. I mean that's changed a little bit of it look over the TV but we don't get into that today.

170
00:16:06,529 --> 00:16:11,649
but I have some a lot of people. five years before

171
00:16:11,649 --> 00:16:16,857
their death and I'm on cancer no they have cancer they don't have any symptoms maybe

172
00:16:16,857 --> 00:16:22,057
if someone did a chest x-ray for some reason they might've a found small spot but they feel

173
00:16:22,057 --> 00:16:27,137
perfectly fine. most people that are destined to die in five years

174
00:16:27,137 --> 00:16:32,237
and cardiovascular disease are having problems you know

175
00:16:32,237 --> 00:16:37,317
maybe even with the activities of daily living there may be so short of breath because they're in some kind of hard younger

176
00:16:37,317 --> 00:16:42,357
and so on. so that's okay that's the answer I was looking for right. just

177
00:16:42,357 --> 00:16:47,757
think of that comparison. oh right something makes you sick for a long time.

178
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:53,697
you're you can be removed from the work place more earlier. so that means

179
00:16:53,697 --> 00:16:58,897
that when you go out and only look at people are currently today on this particular day gainfully

180
00:16:58,897 --> 00:17:04,117
employed. you expect to see a lower percentage of those

181
00:17:04,117 --> 00:17:09,137
people died soon from that chronic debilitating disease as compared

182
00:17:09,137 --> 00:17:14,397
to what fraction of those we died of lung cancer

183
00:17:14,397 --> 00:17:19,477
because the lung cancer presents late did that make but what we just said is

184
00:17:19,477 --> 00:17:28,457
that making sense to people 's. okay. alright. so.

185
00:17:28,457 --> 00:17:33,637
so there's also a covert aging affect on the healthy worker effect.

186
00:17:33,637 --> 00:17:39,057
so the magnitude of the healthy worker effect so what I say magnitude maybe this is totally clear

187
00:17:39,057 --> 00:17:44,057
as day. this is we're back all because now

188
00:17:44,057 --> 00:17:49,157
who's insane. okay. if you'd be all cause mortality

189
00:17:49,157 --> 00:17:54,537
is say sixty sixty percent is like as likely as compared to another

190
00:17:54,537 --> 00:17:59,797
population where it's eighty eighty percent likely than the magnitude how the work effect is much

191
00:17:59,797 --> 00:18:04,857
more can the sixty. alright because it's saying it's much much more protected. they're

192
00:18:04,857 --> 00:18:10,737
much for different than the general population. 's and the ones where the

193
00:18:10,737 --> 00:18:15,861
the cost mentality is gonna be eighty all right so the magnitude

194
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:20,881
healthy worker effect tends to decrease as the working population ages that does need to

195
00:18:20,881 --> 00:18:26,901
be taken same car and falls on overtime.

196
00:18:26,901 --> 00:18:32,301
I'd say most of the hiring round age twenty twenty five to some jobs and

197
00:18:32,301 --> 00:18:37,561
you look at their off you look at their all cost mortality thereafter are for any cause

198
00:18:37,561 --> 00:18:42,761
of death when they're thirty. it's gonna be much much lower

199
00:18:42,761 --> 00:18:48,501
then you would see for the general population. if you come back and look at these people and they're sixty.

200
00:18:48,501 --> 00:18:54,221
it's still gonna be lower than that and that they normal retirement age of sixty five and this particular

201
00:18:54,221 --> 00:18:59,461
facility. when you come back and look at one eight six eight. still gonna be lower. but

202
00:18:59,461 --> 00:19:05,601
it won't be as much lower. it will be sort of closing towards more similar to the general population.

203
00:19:05,601 --> 00:19:10,841
so we've already. we were hard to give a reason for this. if

204
00:19:10,841 --> 00:19:18,261
you think about what we talked about anyway will you say whether I think that's true.

205
00:19:18,261 --> 00:19:23,521
it's same reason I told you that um. if you compared to

206
00:19:23,521 --> 00:19:29,161
fifty two people fifty five years old. the person who hired at eight fifty

207
00:19:29,161 --> 00:19:34,221
is likely to be much healthier and less like I think it died or next year and the person

208
00:19:34,221 --> 00:19:40,361
hard and the dates twenty or twenty five. basically because

209
00:19:40,361 --> 00:19:45,641
gas hired requires you to be particularly healthy. someone actually

210
00:19:45,641 --> 00:19:50,737
saying we wanna offer you this job and you don't have to

211
00:19:50,737 --> 00:19:55,957
be as healthy to stay on the job once you have it so. so

212
00:19:55,957 --> 00:20:00,957
you were hired a long time ago. you must been real healthy then that all kinds of

213
00:20:00,957 --> 00:20:05,977
things and again I'm not tired nothing happening at work we'll get to that later. just all kinds of things could

214
00:20:05,977 --> 00:20:11,237
happen to you natural cars and your unique on forty years after you're hired.

215
00:20:11,237 --> 00:20:16,397
your health status is gonna look much closer to the total general population. then when

216
00:20:16,397 --> 00:20:22,177
you were hired that make some kinda sense I have diagrams of this is the end.

217
00:20:22,177 --> 00:20:27,177
okay. so let's let's so focus it on healthy worker effect and

218
00:20:27,177 --> 00:20:32,557
heart disease. so like we said. significant because it's chronic

219
00:20:32,557 --> 00:20:37,777
disease expect to see big healthy worker effect and it's also even a small

220
00:20:37,777 --> 00:20:43,637
distortion of the standardized mortality rate shows important because it's a very common disease.

221
00:20:43,637 --> 00:20:48,762
Howard you'll see large attributable reps and what I mean so if I say that

222
00:20:48,762 --> 00:20:53,802
twenty five percent of all people are gonna die of heart disease say here in the United States and

223
00:20:53,802 --> 00:20:58,842
I'd tell you that there's something going on.

224
00:20:58,842 --> 00:21:04,022
maybe we'll talk about complicated than that but there's something going on

225
00:21:04,022 --> 00:21:09,422
where in certain population there. their heart disease as a mark

226
00:21:09,422 --> 00:21:15,082
is going to be eighty eighty percent of what is for the general US population.

227
00:21:15,082 --> 00:21:20,342
so what does that mean in absolute terms means instead of them having a twenty five

228
00:21:20,342 --> 00:21:25,682
percent likelihood of dying of heart disease they now have a twenty percent likelihood

229
00:21:25,682 --> 00:21:31,022
because twenty is eighty percent of twenty five. so that's up five percent

230
00:21:31,022 --> 00:21:36,042
fall in mortality that's like a pretty big difference actually if you're

231
00:21:36,042 --> 00:21:41,082
trying to close comparison words if I told you that um I

232
00:21:41,082 --> 00:21:46,282
had for whatever reason. if you look at the soft tissue sarcoma people died

233
00:21:46,282 --> 00:21:51,346
of that well hi told you that um people are

234
00:21:51,346 --> 00:21:56,606
only half as likely to die

235
00:21:56,606 --> 00:22:01,826
well. okay that's important no. bye. if only one

236
00:22:01,826 --> 00:22:07,146
in the thousand people are dying of thought about this you. sarcoma. when I say pass

237
00:22:07,146 --> 00:22:12,286
is likely. okay now instead of you have a a lot of the thousand chance you only have a point

238
00:22:12,286 --> 00:22:17,506
five thousand chance. you only change things by point five thousand and change things

239
00:22:17,506 --> 00:22:23,586
by something like five percent with for the hard example. alright so

240
00:22:23,586 --> 00:22:28,626
so we care about the sources that the are for heart disease because they're so too

241
00:22:28,626 --> 00:22:36,206
with a big attributable risk and finite.

242
00:22:36,206 --> 00:22:42,766
if workers actually are developing heart disease because of workplace exposure. we expect.

243
00:22:42,766 --> 00:22:47,802
we're gonna dampen any exposure response relationship with surgeon the date why

244
00:22:47,802 --> 00:22:52,982
because the exposure leads. we're saying now we have it. so this is the first time I that okay now

245
00:22:52,982 --> 00:22:58,162
let's suppose there's workplace exposure that's causing problems up to now we haven't

246
00:22:58,162 --> 00:23:03,662
really introduced that. Kate now introducing yourself in the workplace is positive

247
00:23:03,662 --> 00:23:10,462
part. I don't know people who work with

248
00:23:10,462 --> 00:23:15,802
people and make like explosive like nitroglycerin 's inches it's complicated

249
00:23:15,802 --> 00:23:21,442
I won't go into TNT. they're actually more likely die of heart disease if they have some substantial

250
00:23:21,442 --> 00:23:26,562
exposure. so there's somebody at work is talking more heart disease and

251
00:23:26,562 --> 00:23:31,562
what we're saying here is it's gonna be hard

252
00:23:31,562 --> 00:23:36,802
to demonstrate that because

253
00:23:36,802 --> 00:23:42,322
the exposure bleeding heart disease which is leading to early termination

254
00:23:42,322 --> 00:23:47,422
from work because it's a chronic debilitating disease which means if you look at what people

255
00:23:47,422 --> 00:23:52,422
usually look at least used to usually look at what the person 's human exposure to

256
00:23:52,422 --> 00:23:57,602
nitroglycerin it work over their entire life time. okay.

257
00:23:57,602 --> 00:24:02,642
the people that actually got sick. got the heart disease and the doctor questions

258
00:24:02,642 --> 00:24:07,722
are gonna systematically tend to have lower exposure. they would have had if

259
00:24:07,722 --> 00:24:13,242
they had become ill from the nitroglycerin that makes sense. everybody follow that

260
00:24:13,242 --> 00:24:18,322
now. I'll say it again a different way. well actually I mean

261
00:24:18,322 --> 00:24:24,822
I mean I mean do something more spectacular

262
00:24:24,822 --> 00:24:30,242
because it's too complicated we have to think about something really fuzzy disease. that's the policy that

263
00:24:30,242 --> 00:24:35,562
people are working the work is completely neutral. 's not actually behind actually increasing

264
00:24:35,562 --> 00:24:41,142
your probability the fact that you work. if not there's no increase your probability

265
00:24:41,142 --> 00:24:47,018
of going from any okay. as path I play I said

266
00:24:47,018 --> 00:24:55,798
you know I put these new

267
00:24:55,798 --> 00:25:01,718
HVAC system and even though there wasn't really a problem with us in the workplace.

268
00:25:01,718 --> 00:25:06,998
I'm removing all the dogs and

269
00:25:06,998 --> 00:25:12,178
release that expenses. 's protected help helping

270
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:17,198
guarantee to there they don't die. they would without

271
00:25:17,198 --> 00:25:22,318
the HVAC system I just thought about dead wrong. they expected is

272
00:25:22,318 --> 00:25:27,538
doing nothing related dust novels there wasn't anything that was really up and

273
00:25:27,538 --> 00:25:33,318
kinda doesn't have doubles are so low to start with maybe this is what.

274
00:25:33,318 --> 00:25:38,878
so I do a study and I say okay I'm going to you I'm in a shared

275
00:25:38,878 --> 00:25:43,878
number of years each person was exposed my expenses and look

276
00:25:43,878 --> 00:25:49,238
at their probability of dying after after that many years

277
00:25:49,238 --> 00:25:55,038
well if I do that study. just the way I described what I gonna find I'm going to find

278
00:25:55,038 --> 00:26:00,838
that low and behold people that had the longest exposure to my HVAC system.

279
00:26:00,838 --> 00:26:05,958
to be much older than the people they had shorter exposure the HVAC systems there.

280
00:26:05,958 --> 00:26:11,658
I've proven that the HVAC system is protecting your house. what's really going on.

281
00:26:11,658 --> 00:26:17,478
well. when people get ill from anything especially with chronic debilitating.

282
00:26:17,478 --> 00:26:22,618
they're gonna leave the workplace and then off the my data. oh they had to work anymore they haven't had as much

283
00:26:22,618 --> 00:26:27,688
many years of exposure HVAC system and they die and the people had lots of years

284
00:26:27,688 --> 00:26:32,928
of exposure to buy HVAC systems. so I think I've proved that expect I this is and protecting

285
00:26:32,928 --> 00:26:37,928
people 's house but actually with no such thing is going on. simply

286
00:26:37,928 --> 00:26:43,208
because if you

287
00:26:43,208 --> 00:26:48,208
leave work early. a lot of times the reason you left work early before

288
00:26:48,208 --> 00:26:53,308
retirement is because your deal with something even if it has nothing to do with work and

289
00:26:53,308 --> 00:26:58,928
if you are tell us something about life gonna die soon. so then

290
00:26:58,928 --> 00:27:04,228
if you start measuring exposures that only happen while you're at work. the people

291
00:27:04,228 --> 00:27:09,448
that are becoming ill from whatever because it's just exactly getting

292
00:27:09,448 --> 00:27:16,068
less exposure. okay that that make yourself in a sense that

293
00:27:16,068 --> 00:27:21,548
I see why this person is claiming that his or her HVAC system is

294
00:27:21,548 --> 00:27:26,656
this remarkable thing with the protective of health but I think that person 's mistake.

295
00:27:26,656 --> 00:27:31,695
just has to do with sick people leave and they don't they don't around the HVAC systems

296
00:27:31,695 --> 00:27:36,755
on. alright. so this is the problem

297
00:27:36,755 --> 00:27:53,495
this is what this is a big part of why we're spending so much time talk about it. go ahead.

298
00:27:53,495 --> 00:27:58,555
well it is the same for both. bye. if you know yeah it is the same for

299
00:27:58,555 --> 00:28:03,755
both but let me explain the reason I did HVAC was I said all that

300
00:28:03,755 --> 00:28:08,795
maybe it's too complicated to talk about something. actually causing disease in the

301
00:28:08,795 --> 00:28:14,135
workplace I don't even what I was trying to say is I don't even need something that's actually kind disease

302
00:28:14,135 --> 00:28:20,156
in the workplace. I can show you. you can come to the wrong conclusion without even introducing.

303
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:26,011
so but Corey you're very interested in knowing whether something in the workplace

304
00:28:26,011 --> 00:28:31,651
actually is really causing to see cells going back to this like

305
00:28:31,651 --> 00:28:36,832
people are being exposed to nitroglycerin. so you gonna do a study right.

306
00:28:36,832 --> 00:28:42,092
we're gonna look at this week I won't get it to today but we're gonna look at this later and I think you gonna

307
00:28:42,092 --> 00:28:47,192
you gonna say oh this is like you get how you like to change

308
00:28:47,192 --> 00:28:52,371
the numbers on that to had make those numbers come out that way. if we're gonna go to this very simple look

309
00:28:52,371 --> 00:28:57,651
in example and I'm gonna say to you. well

310
00:28:57,651 --> 00:29:03,952
should I tell my cousin that it's okay to take a job in the high exposure department

311
00:29:03,952 --> 00:29:09,092
and I'm gonna show you that if you analyze the data about the level

312
00:29:09,092 --> 00:29:15,391
of exposure based on the person human exposure today. age and in the high exposure department

313
00:29:15,391 --> 00:29:20,631
that you would come to the conclusion that it doesn't cost a problem.

314
00:29:20,631 --> 00:29:26,919
so that's like a typical you know I'm just looking human exposure or

315
00:29:26,919 --> 00:29:33,299
if you say all the problems early termination from work because the person became ill.

316
00:29:33,299 --> 00:29:38,559
where to go through this so I'm setting you up for it. so don't worry if it doesn't make complete sense yes

317
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:43,799
even. so if you say no I mean you it differently because work

318
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:48,919
is actually an intervening variable on the council passed away I'm not supposed to adjust for

319
00:29:48,919 --> 00:29:53,979
it. I'm suppose just leave it in there. so we're gonna treat it like that

320
00:29:53,979 --> 00:29:59,019
so basically we're gonna maybe try to strata

321
00:29:59,019 --> 00:30:05,539
five who left work early. we didn't I mean show you an example where you get the wrong answer

322
00:30:05,539 --> 00:30:10,959
with the wrong answer being it it doesn't make you sick to go on to high exposure

323
00:30:10,959 --> 00:30:16,139
department when actually it does you can get the wrong answer by any traditional

324
00:30:16,139 --> 00:30:21,339
way of doing it in the house. so what you have to do a different kind of analysis

325
00:30:21,339 --> 00:30:26,634
that's where we're gonna end up with this is about a healthy worker survivor

326
00:30:26,634 --> 00:30:32,154
effect healthy workers three. okay. so

327
00:30:32,154 --> 00:30:37,254
so so what's really on this side is just say hey healthy worker effect in heart disease

328
00:30:37,254 --> 00:30:42,514
is a big deal. five people die hard disease of you. if you're changing things even

329
00:30:42,514 --> 00:30:47,754
a little bit. the attributable risks the actual number people dying changes a lot. and

330
00:30:47,754 --> 00:30:53,294
it's a chronic debilitating disease that you can expect a big healthy worker effect. and

331
00:30:53,294 --> 00:30:58,833
you know that sort the of true of everything. if something had work

332
00:30:58,833 --> 00:31:03,854
making you sick by giving your heart disease which you'd like

333
00:31:03,854 --> 00:31:08,933
to know about it may be very hard to demonstrate that has the healthy

334
00:31:08,933 --> 00:31:15,354
burger fair. that's with the slides. so far. alright.

335
00:31:15,354 --> 00:31:23,846
so okay. here is the example I had I guess right

336
00:31:23,846 --> 00:31:28,946
the first thing says the workplace exposure had no effect on heart disease whatsoever. stuff doesn't because it

337
00:31:28,946 --> 00:31:34,026
doesn't prevent it. protective for the same reason the workers

338
00:31:34,026 --> 00:31:39,686
I just said this is the example of the work to developing heart disease. are gonna terminate employment early.

339
00:31:39,686 --> 00:31:44,826
so the Honda lowered to live exposure whatever in the workplace. and

340
00:31:44,826 --> 00:31:49,946
if you do now if it's basically which we typically often very often do say okay

341
00:31:49,946 --> 00:31:55,366
let's see if it does respond to look at the two hundred exposure as possible look at the human exposure

342
00:31:55,366 --> 00:32:00,766
and see whether that's predictive of the person 's health status like whether they're gonna die

343
00:32:00,766 --> 00:32:07,726
you will you gonna see dead workers developing

344
00:32:07,726 --> 00:32:13,226
heart disease. I've been terminate employment early. you can have lower to move exposure.

345
00:32:13,226 --> 00:32:19,126
so you're gonna conclude that if you cannot think you get through. if you are in the class

346
00:32:19,126 --> 00:32:24,359
I think something of work is protecting people from parts of days and then you'll start saying oh it's because

347
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:29,419
working good for you and keeps your mind active and so I'm not has nothing to do with that has to do

348
00:32:29,419 --> 00:32:35,099
with it as fact that if you get sick you know we've worked

349
00:32:35,099 --> 00:32:40,219
worked and make you healthier. it's just two correlated because you don't work

350
00:32:40,219 --> 00:32:55,099
as much if you become sick. yeah

351
00:32:55,099 --> 00:33:00,959
well you're on to something because basically that that what you wanna do is look at

352
00:33:00,959 --> 00:33:06,206
you only wanna compare people have the same occupation like

353
00:33:06,206 --> 00:33:11,806
you want. you only wanna compare workers the workers people that left work people last work

354
00:33:11,806 --> 00:33:16,885
and so on. so basically you want you only wanna compare people that have the same

355
00:33:16,885 --> 00:33:22,106
history. say up to a point in time and then you just gonna look at they tell you just

356
00:33:22,106 --> 00:33:27,166
diverge for a year and then do they come out with a different result of the year.

357
00:33:27,166 --> 00:33:32,206
it's essentially the message we're gonna talk about which are on here and substance so I essentially

358
00:33:32,206 --> 00:33:37,486
do that. so they make sure they only compare sort of like oranges to oranges not oranges

359
00:33:37,486 --> 00:33:46,826
apples and oranges and apples being are you still at work or you know it still works. okay.

360
00:33:46,826 --> 00:33:53,226
we'll go through the example when you get there. and. okay. so

361
00:33:53,226 --> 00:33:58,646
and the other thing so this is a problem for heart disease but unfortunately

362
00:33:58,646 --> 00:34:04,323
just to let you know it's a little trickier than that. that's the second six bullet here

363
00:34:04,323 --> 00:34:09,323
because even if workplace exposure causes the rapidly fatal disease

364
00:34:09,323 --> 00:34:14,462
like lung cancer because of interaction with smoking which is also

365
00:34:14,462 --> 00:34:19,562
a risk factor for chronic debilitating disease like heart disease and and chronic instructions

366
00:34:19,562 --> 00:34:24,722
from a disease. you may still see more effect

367
00:34:24,722 --> 00:34:30,103
than you expected because so not I'm this one. maybe

368
00:34:30,103 --> 00:34:35,302
makes intuitive sense to you or not. so more complicated to explain but I'm just warning

369
00:34:35,302 --> 00:34:40,302
you that if you look at something like cigarette smoking as part

370
00:34:40,302 --> 00:34:45,643
of what's going on with the rest factors. you may see more significant bigger

371
00:34:45,643 --> 00:34:51,722
healthy worker effect for lung cancer you would've expected because

372
00:34:51,722 --> 00:34:56,722
of the interaction with people having to leave work early hard with to see from the

373
00:34:56,722 --> 00:35:01,982
cigarettes. alright. so so let's talk

374
00:35:01,982 --> 00:35:07,571
about how you control you know how do you things how do you make sure

375
00:35:07,571 --> 00:35:12,970
that you come to the correct conclusion when you do an epidemiologic study or

376
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:18,370
workers and don't come to incorrect conclusions.

377
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:23,831
so you're healthy worker effect one that was the healthy higher fact in right.

378
00:35:23,831 --> 00:35:31,210
that was you know thing about you

379
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:36,230
so that was those are that newly hired for employment. I gonna have a lower age

380
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:45,250
specific mortality in the stores population for John. alright.

381
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:50,331
so instead of using the smart population from which from which

382
00:35:50,331 --> 00:35:55,510
they were drawn meaning the entire regional or the entire US population including all the people aren't

383
00:35:55,510 --> 00:36:00,610
working. you could use internal controls means you only compare workers to

384
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:06,207
workers. so that if you only ever compare workers the workers

385
00:36:06,207 --> 00:36:11,227
and you never can hear workers in the general population this includes people that aren't working

386
00:36:11,227 --> 00:36:16,487
and you you've gotten rid of healthy worker effect one which is actually why

387
00:36:16,487 --> 00:36:21,646
a lot of the strongest best most

388
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:27,587
convincing retrospective cohort studies

389
00:36:27,587 --> 00:36:32,727
only include people who are all workers but have different levels of exposure to when

390
00:36:32,727 --> 00:36:37,906
every nation is that you're concerned about because then you know that I'm like an ass and Martha you know have to worry

391
00:36:37,906 --> 00:36:43,167
about. well there's just there's still healthy work hire healthy worker hires

392
00:36:43,167 --> 00:36:48,406
are there because everybody was tired they're all working. okay. so if healthy worker

393
00:36:48,406 --> 00:36:53,487
effect do that with the time and tired fact so that was an idea and you have two people are both age

394
00:36:53,487 --> 00:36:58,547
fifty five the person hired at age fifty. it's much less likely die next year than the

395
00:36:58,547 --> 00:37:03,554
person hearted of age twenty because they're hard so long ago they've had more

396
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:08,675
time for their health deteriorates not because they were just I mean

397
00:37:08,675 --> 00:37:13,875
could be but I think that's gonna happen even if there's nothing work at to solve the problem.

398
00:37:13,875 --> 00:37:19,034
so what can you do about that when you doing your date now you can control

399
00:37:19,034 --> 00:37:24,314
for the day to hire you treats the date of hire the confound the usual

400
00:37:24,314 --> 00:37:30,034
way. so if you use the usual methods that you would control for that. you can get by stratification

401
00:37:30,034 --> 00:37:35,554
they. only put people in groups together who are hired in the last you know

402
00:37:35,554 --> 00:37:40,794
five in the same five years. or you can do mathematical modeling. you know put it on

403
00:37:40,794 --> 00:37:46,314
some kind of regression equation. so that's that's all good. that's all fine

404
00:37:46,314 --> 00:37:51,554
and we get a healthy worker effect three to help the very survivor

405
00:37:51,554 --> 00:37:56,755
which is the whole issue about people that leave work

406
00:37:56,755 --> 00:38:01,837
early. alright. are more likely to die in the next

407
00:38:01,837 --> 00:38:06,997
year people continue working everything else but together. let me

408
00:38:06,997 --> 00:38:12,377
just make sure I said in a way that still makes sense. right. burgers determining

409
00:38:12,377 --> 00:38:18,017
climbing early before normal retirement experience increased mortality.

410
00:38:18,017 --> 00:38:23,057
so for that one. there's no. I was out of Santa Monica there's not a cell for

411
00:38:23,057 --> 00:38:28,717
standard method of control that's adequate and the reason that

412
00:38:28,717 --> 00:38:33,957
here isn't is because early termination of employment. general

413
00:38:33,957 --> 00:38:38,977
I would be both confound chicken salad new data because it's associated with

414
00:38:38,977 --> 00:38:45,277
both exposure. you can only get exposed if you're at work right and have the disease out

415
00:38:45,277 --> 00:38:50,577
there something wrong with on average and people leave early so just mostly with the disease out

416
00:38:50,577 --> 00:38:56,197
and at the same time it's an intermediate variable on the call the pathway from exposure to see

417
00:38:56,197 --> 00:39:01,317
meeting. well you're you're changing whether the person 's exposure is really can continue

418
00:39:01,317 --> 00:39:06,456
it or not when you say they left work early or didn't leave work early. so you

419
00:39:06,456 --> 00:39:11,876
have to use some special statistical methods to address.

420
00:39:11,876 --> 00:39:16,996
so. so here's a diagram that's saying

421
00:39:16,996 --> 00:39:22,036
okay you got exposure work. it causes people to leave

422
00:39:22,036 --> 00:39:27,556
work early for normal retirement. and if you've left work early.

423
00:39:27,556 --> 00:39:33,516
whatever the reason is that makes it more likely that you're applying to

424
00:39:33,516 --> 00:39:38,816
the diagnosed with the disease or die from the disease. okay. so that first Darryl

425
00:39:38,816 --> 00:39:43,838
is saying and adverse exposure is because if you do leave work

426
00:39:43,838 --> 00:39:49,658
early so there's something about this exposure and and also because you left work early.

427
00:39:49,658 --> 00:39:55,298
that's that is associated with the disease outcome. but

428
00:39:55,298 --> 00:40:00,418
so the problem now is that you also have this arrow going back which is basically

429
00:40:00,418 --> 00:40:06,598
saying well if I leave work early. that changes my exposure

430
00:40:06,598 --> 00:40:11,838
into going into the future because I know I'm no longer exposed because I left whatever I left work

431
00:40:11,838 --> 00:40:17,058
on the longer exposed. so this is die grammatically showing you that it's both in intervening

432
00:40:17,058 --> 00:40:22,738
variable on the cargo pathway from exposure disease. but the same time. it's actually

433
00:40:22,738 --> 00:40:27,798
confound because it's associated with the disease outcome and with the

434
00:40:27,798 --> 00:40:32,858
exposure at the same time. so this diagram is

435
00:40:32,858 --> 00:40:39,659
a problem in terms of traditional ways of analyzing data. okay

436
00:40:39,659 --> 00:40:44,860
you're gonna like Samantha be so much better. so give me.

437
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:52,260
alright my wife Robinson this is not just preach mine now.

438
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:58,260
so the eighties and I like techniques were they

439
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:03,280
so these are developed actually and there is in a drop the sort of mid nineteen

440
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:08,340
eighties but it took a long time before people start understanding what was the problem

441
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:13,459
here and why it was done and now every

442
00:41:13,459 --> 00:41:18,600
you know sort of sophisticated statisticians and you everything

443
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:26,060
know I did say right we know we need to do that. so.

444
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:31,080
so I was you asking about. so this is that it's it's

445
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:36,219
always G test gee just stands for general. I don't think it stands for anything so there's

446
00:41:36,219 --> 00:41:41,731
different ways to do this that you to do a different type of analysis and you match cases

447
00:41:41,731 --> 00:41:47,151
nine cases on past history of exposure and employment status. so.

448
00:41:47,151 --> 00:41:52,371
so you only compare people who have the same past history of exposure

449
00:41:52,371 --> 00:41:58,511
in the same employment status options on some point that closed

450
00:41:58,511 --> 00:42:03,731
up to some part of this close to saying okay. they can diverge with they're only now allowed

451
00:42:03,731 --> 00:42:09,691
to diverge they for one year. I can not not in the time before and

452
00:42:09,691 --> 00:42:14,691
I'm right and then you say

453
00:42:14,691 --> 00:42:20,231
and then you look at. okay that one year they're allowed to type words. do they have different

454
00:42:20,231 --> 00:42:25,391
do the difference in exposures during that last year of work. everything 's been the same

455
00:42:25,391 --> 00:42:30,711
and their work history up and then and then they diverge and who's exposing who isn't

456
00:42:30,711 --> 00:42:36,671
doing that is that associated with differences in

457
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:41,987
their disease status or probability of having disease okay

458
00:42:41,987 --> 00:42:47,107
and you never compare workers currently employed to those not currently employed because they were just

459
00:42:47,107 --> 00:42:52,847
talking about they're just conceptually distinct group if you're not employed

460
00:42:52,847 --> 00:42:57,927
and because there because it means that their exposure and status

461
00:42:57,927 --> 00:43:02,948
and their house that is very been influenced my past exposure and then you

462
00:43:02,948 --> 00:43:09,087
can also cover all the usual contenders. so this is just a idea.

463
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:14,208
so I'm gonna try. I think I'll make this the last five and then when

464
00:43:14,208 --> 00:43:19,927
we start next next time we'll start with the example

465
00:43:19,927 --> 00:43:25,307
with the numbers and we sort of go through them and I think I'll make some kind of sense to you. so

466
00:43:25,307 --> 00:43:30,327
what's the reasoning here. what why and you need to sow their message. so if this is saying

467
00:43:30,327 --> 00:43:35,448
that it's and now I to what that what you have to

468
00:43:35,448 --> 00:43:40,647
do is appropriate now. as analysis or randomized controlled clinical trial.

469
00:43:40,647 --> 00:43:45,694
so hi most you keep people in the room even if you

470
00:43:45,694 --> 00:43:51,253
haven't taken the course of heard this before. so when you're gonna analyze

471
00:43:51,253 --> 00:43:56,854
the results of a randomized controlled clinical trials that means you know you maybe

472
00:43:56,854 --> 00:44:01,854
treat maybe a more difficult thing would be you're looking for treatment help people. so you got all these

473
00:44:01,854 --> 00:44:07,654
people have a certain disease and treat stream in a in the

474
00:44:07,654 --> 00:44:13,073
treatment of choice currently producing treatment see maybe better treatment dates

475
00:44:13,073 --> 00:44:18,073
and so you randomly assign people either get treatment air treatment be and then you follow forward in time

476
00:44:18,073 --> 00:44:23,094
to see what happens with the disease. okay. bye. just make sure that's that

477
00:44:23,094 --> 00:44:31,654
like a typical set up a grandma it's kind of a control trial. so then when you do the date of

478
00:44:31,654 --> 00:44:36,874
years. the what you're supposed to do it do what's called an intention

479
00:44:36,874 --> 00:44:42,407
to treat now. so you don't analyze the data based on

480
00:44:42,407 --> 00:44:47,768
so it's a stream and a taking one kind of pill treatment you taken a different kind of pill. okay.

481
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:53,008
they don't analyze the data based on how many of those pills that somebody actually take you up and

482
00:44:53,008 --> 00:44:58,347
like the day that surely on which the two groups they were assigned to swipe all the intention

483
00:44:58,347 --> 00:45:03,347
to treat. alright. not what treatment of the first actually receive it's like what was

484
00:45:03,347 --> 00:45:08,367
intended. assuming they have fully been able to fully participate comply

485
00:45:08,367 --> 00:45:14,188
with the study. what treatment what they've gotten. okay. so

486
00:45:14,188 --> 00:45:19,488
strong show to you why that's the reason what's up here reasons

487
00:45:19,488 --> 00:45:24,667
and everyone agrees that the analysis that you really

488
00:45:24,667 --> 00:45:29,887
need to do if you randomize clinical control trial is an intention to treat

489
00:45:29,887 --> 00:45:35,087
analysis what I'm gonna argue that what makes

490
00:45:35,087 --> 00:45:40,367
everyone agree about that means that

491
00:45:40,367 --> 00:45:45,498
you have to analyze occupational data like what we have

492
00:45:45,498 --> 00:45:50,518
from. we're not even offer from environmental studies you have to analyze

493
00:45:50,518 --> 00:45:55,778
it in a different way because you're violating you're essentially violating the

494
00:45:55,778 --> 00:46:01,018
intention of the treat. that's what the argument is on the page. okay. I know it's a little complicated I

495
00:46:01,018 --> 00:46:06,278
just wanna go through it. so tell us about you got this randomized clinical trial

496
00:46:06,278 --> 00:46:12,438
and he wants to test the efficacy of the new drug regimen be as compared to the current standard eight

497
00:46:12,438 --> 00:46:17,718
each. so you understand his subject is + two intended treatment

498
00:46:17,718 --> 00:46:22,812
and and they do that now if it's on Nintendo treatment. why did they do

499
00:46:22,812 --> 00:46:27,872
that. I imagine that it was a state of nature that mom and

500
00:46:27,872 --> 00:46:32,972
only among individuals who were tested to die quickly from the disease

501
00:46:32,972 --> 00:46:38,092
it's being treated. the probability of developing serious side effects to drug

502
00:46:38,092 --> 00:46:43,812
regimens he is hot. okay. being so the new one and

503
00:46:43,812 --> 00:46:48,991
there's nobody knows that but suppose it's a state of nature that the people

504
00:46:48,991 --> 00:46:54,112
that are actually going to die quickly from their disease anyway. have

505
00:46:54,112 --> 00:46:59,271
a really have a higher probability of having serious side effects to drug regimen.

506
00:46:59,271 --> 00:47:04,432
the course if you have serious side effects that mean you stop the drug right.

507
00:47:04,432 --> 00:47:09,692
so the deaths inside. anyway we'll see street and it would be prematurely

508
00:47:09,692 --> 00:47:14,812
leading to reduce cumulative to be. so if you analyze the data by the

509
00:47:14,812 --> 00:47:19,925
actual does rather than intended out he is gonna appear picked

510
00:47:19,925 --> 00:47:25,145
protective even in fact if in fact has no effect

511
00:47:25,145 --> 00:47:30,405
whatsoever on the risk of death but other words I'm trying my new treatment.

512
00:47:30,405 --> 00:47:35,625
it's not not obnoxious including me. just so happens this is state nature.

513
00:47:35,625 --> 00:47:40,665
not that the people that were gonna die quickly. anyway give treatment he

514
00:47:40,665 --> 00:47:46,205
gets stick get to satisfaction the treatment and there and therefore

515
00:47:46,205 --> 00:47:52,225
they don't finish their treatment fee. they only take us a little bit other pills and they stop.

516
00:47:52,225 --> 00:47:57,465
so if you analyze it. bye. how you do feel people got hot

517
00:47:57,465 --> 00:48:03,285
people to did not take too much treatment because they were own to bother

518
00:48:03,285 --> 00:48:08,585
the looks of the salt treatment he did not all died much later that proves

519
00:48:08,585 --> 00:48:15,205
the treatment be effective in protecting you from time to see

520
00:48:15,205 --> 00:48:20,249
a lot of what how many pills people actually

521
00:48:20,249 --> 00:48:25,309
that's the conclusion you're making some kind of sense.

522
00:48:25,309 --> 00:48:30,649
okay. but I didn't that you

523
00:48:30,649 --> 00:48:35,689
supposed to be an air identically effective except because

524
00:48:35,689 --> 00:48:40,869
of the side effects so you came in the wrong conclusion you know I think we should switch with for

525
00:48:40,869 --> 00:48:53,849
treatment and treat me a

526
00:48:53,849 --> 00:48:59,349
long time to switch the treatment dates. you came to the wrong conclusion. if you do attention to treat.

527
00:48:59,349 --> 00:49:04,729
we just don't pay attention to how many pills anyone taps just with the person assigned to hate

528
00:49:04,729 --> 00:49:10,209
or they decide to be. if you do intentionally treat intention to treat analysis.

529
00:49:10,209 --> 00:49:15,229
you will come to the correct conclusion that any of you no different from each other and

530
00:49:15,229 --> 00:49:20,237
doesn't work so basically what this saying is is that

531
00:49:20,237 --> 00:49:25,397
when you doing an observational study which is all we have usually but overdoing workplace

532
00:49:25,397 --> 00:49:30,497
or environmental studies. you don't wanna sign the treatment.

533
00:49:30,497 --> 00:49:35,617
you don't know what the treatment is the exposure is without the

534
00:49:35,617 --> 00:49:40,777
side effects called people leave work. so you're you need to do something

535
00:49:40,777 --> 00:49:45,857
that's analogous to the attention street analysis

536
00:49:45,857 --> 00:49:52,017
to get the right answer and observational study. if you can't do it because

537
00:49:52,017 --> 00:49:57,017
you don't there is no like group and treatment and treatment be the people are assigned

538
00:49:57,017 --> 00:50:02,437
to you. this is what everyone was assigned to finalize it that way. so if

539
00:50:02,437 --> 00:50:08,617
if counting pills gives you the wrong answer and the randomized control trial.

540
00:50:08,617 --> 00:50:13,877
that means that the usual way historically people have analyzed observational

541
00:50:13,877 --> 00:50:18,921
studies will give you the wrong answer that's that's what the argument is on

542
00:50:18,921 --> 00:50:24,301
the screen it's basically saying you can't deal with that healthy worker effect three

543
00:50:24,301 --> 00:50:29,421
which is you know stopping the pills inside is like leaving work early from from

544
00:50:29,421 --> 00:50:34,581
the effects of exposure. you cannot do an analysis it takes account of

545
00:50:34,581 --> 00:50:40,281
that using any of the sort of traditional message when you treated the compound don't usaa contenders

546
00:50:40,281 --> 00:50:45,721
have to do something different. one of the G G. message

547
00:50:45,721 --> 00:50:50,881
okay. Hope Samantha bee 's really convincing lines everything up

548
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:56,201
here. so just so you know what's gonna happen next and I can do it.

549
00:50:56,201 --> 00:51:01,441
but next is this dad looking page but what's fine about this bad looking page is

550
00:51:01,441 --> 00:51:06,601
that I think I mean very wrong.

551
00:51:06,601 --> 00:51:11,621
oh right. I see what I can tell like kind of the

552
00:51:11,621 --> 00:51:17,083
work hard for you to park my life. even though

553
00:51:17,083 --> 00:51:25,143
no forget that's right yeah

554
00:51:25,143 --> 00:52:16,453
a lot of

555
00:52:16,453 --> 00:52:34,893
yeah

556
00:52:34,893 --> 00:53:03,178
for

557
00:53:03,178 --> 00:53:08,579
farmers in this country now and workers.

558
00:53:08,579 --> 00:53:14,299
also I show working in the Philippines.

559
00:53:14,299 --> 00:53:20,579
yeah hold Boudreau claims a lot of bookings how

560
00:53:20,579 --> 00:53:25,879
much they want and first check you should work under Paul

561
00:53:25,879 --> 00:53:31,619
quarterback fast easy for this long day. he

562
00:53:31,619 --> 00:53:36,999
said on Saturdays maybe a another degree. wow. 's a

563
00:53:36,999 --> 00:53:42,839
cool off the rest. okay.

564
00:53:42,839 --> 00:53:48,119
oh neat experience but it's not an actual form

565
00:53:48,119 --> 00:53:54,640
of course he wouldn't mind the right class and lost

566
00:53:54,640 --> 00:54:00,620
we don't need more laws on the books to track everybody everything. that

567
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:05,640
are kind of then we have some for seven -year-olds.

568
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:11,080
I was going to work out one

569
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:17,680
form standard he really shouldn't actually

570
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:24,060
moving enjoy in a different pharmacy for Carol Stewart

571
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:31,920
your experiences working on for a

572
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:37,820
nice because it's fresh

573
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:44,140
cool changes in the fresh yeah

574
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:50,200
