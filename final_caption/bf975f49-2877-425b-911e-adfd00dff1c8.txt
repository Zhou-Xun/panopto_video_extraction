00:00:08,799 --> 00:00:15,384
Today, we're gonna continue building your skills and using the action reflection.

2
00:00:15,384 --> 00:00:19,446
Now remember it's different than other types of reflections that we've taught.

3
00:00:19,446 --> 00:00:23,875
This is not looking backward, this is not just talking about how you feel,

4
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:26,283
this is talking about what you could do.

5
00:00:26,283 --> 00:00:31,612
Although not every action reflection needs to be introduced with given what you said,

6
00:00:31,612 --> 00:00:35,190
it should be able to be used to introduce your reflection.

7
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:37,986
It should logically flow from what the person said.

8
00:00:37,986 --> 00:00:42,181
Otherwise it's unsolicited advice which we really use in MI.

9
00:00:42,181 --> 00:00:45,174
So given what you said is sort of implicit in the action reflection and

10
00:00:45,174 --> 00:00:48,181
also notice that tentative tone we've talked about this for weeks.

11
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:51,827
You might want to consider this might be an option for you, this could help.

12
00:00:51,827 --> 00:00:54,449
We under promise, we don't want to be too definitive.

13
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:58,792
We don't want to use things like you better do this, you have to use this,

14
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:02,104
that's that controlling language or trying to avoid.

15
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:06,711
So let's practice some more action reflection builds today.

16
00:01:06,711 --> 00:01:21,571
Let's start with this one.

17
00:01:21,571 --> 00:01:28,382
So what would be some action reflections here?

18
00:01:28,382 --> 00:01:32,883
So making something that has some fruit in it or it's a little healthier,

19
00:01:32,883 --> 00:01:35,509
that might satisfy both you and your kids.

20
00:01:35,509 --> 00:01:39,730
Maybe, working together to find a healthier treat that they both like like

21
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:42,813
fruit or something that might be worth talking about.

22
00:01:42,813 --> 00:01:47,411
Getting them more involved in food preparation or getting them more involved

23
00:01:47,411 --> 00:01:51,312
in the shopping or the cooking that might be worth talking about.

24
00:01:51,312 --> 00:01:56,122
Or maybe trying smaller portions of their favorite sweet or reducing the frequency,

25
00:01:56,122 --> 00:01:59,815
compromise two days they get to choose today, mom get to choose.

26
00:01:59,815 --> 00:02:03,996
And then the bottom one is more of a cognitive, more of a B goal.

27
00:02:03,996 --> 00:02:05,228
Get your head right.

28
00:02:05,228 --> 00:02:08,934
Be prepared that in the initial days of this there may be

29
00:02:08,934 --> 00:02:13,270
some complaining that you have to be prepared for.

30
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:19,404
Now here's a little bit more difficult case,

31
00:02:19,404 --> 00:02:27,662
where the parenting maybe isn't that helpful?

32
00:02:27,662 --> 00:02:32,709
So what might you do with this case?

33
00:02:32,709 --> 00:02:35,198
What could you reflect back that would be an action step?

34
00:02:35,198 --> 00:02:41,759
Either change in thought or change in action.

35
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:45,030
So trying to control your child does hasn't worked very well and

36
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:48,251
telling your child what to eat, hasn't been helping him now.

37
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:51,348
These are a little bit harsh, so we're gonna try and soften these.

38
00:02:51,348 --> 00:02:52,187
These are okay.

39
00:02:52,187 --> 00:02:53,948
They're like a B, B minus.

40
00:02:53,948 --> 00:02:57,067
Let's see if we can do a little bit better.

41
00:02:57,067 --> 00:02:59,502
So here are being a little bit more subtle, so

42
00:02:59,502 --> 00:03:02,399
far you haven't involved your son in the decisions.

43
00:03:02,399 --> 00:03:04,089
Now it's leaving a hook at the end of that.

44
00:03:04,089 --> 00:03:07,828
Clearly suggesting that involving your son might be a better way to go.

45
00:03:07,828 --> 00:03:10,287
And that's what the bottom reflection does here.

46
00:03:10,287 --> 00:03:14,457
So involving your son more in these decisions might help them buy into these

47
00:03:14,457 --> 00:03:15,060
changes.

48
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:18,618
Perhaps better than setting the rules for him.

49
00:03:18,618 --> 00:03:19,638
Take a look at this one.

50
00:03:19,638 --> 00:03:32,875
Someone struggling with their snacking behavior.

51
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:39,367
What could you reflect back?

52
00:03:39,367 --> 00:03:43,357
Remember it should work, that given what you said would be a logical

53
00:03:43,357 --> 00:03:45,884
introduction to your action reflection.

54
00:03:45,884 --> 00:03:50,366
So given what you've said, food is a source of joy and it helps you relax.

55
00:03:50,366 --> 00:03:53,713
And you're concerned a little bit about the weight gain,

56
00:03:53,713 --> 00:03:56,180
that maybe finding another way downwind.

57
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,337
Another way to cope with stress.

58
00:03:57,337 --> 00:04:01,413
Another way to bring you joy might be worth talking about.

59
00:04:01,413 --> 00:04:02,744
What would you do here?

60
00:04:02,744 --> 00:04:17,173
What are the action reflections that logically flow from this client statement?

61
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:19,179
Well given what you've said, you have several options.

62
00:04:19,179 --> 00:04:22,042
Remember would like to build menus like to give choice.

63
00:04:22,042 --> 00:04:24,448
Maybe finding a way to prevent over sleeping.

64
00:04:24,448 --> 00:04:25,626
Maybe going to bed earlier.

65
00:04:25,626 --> 00:04:30,187
Maybe getting a different alarm system or maybe not trying six am anymore.

66
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:34,326
Maybe finding another time in the morning or the evening or given what you said.

67
00:04:34,326 --> 00:04:37,172
Maybe the gym isn't the right answer for you.

68
00:04:37,172 --> 00:04:41,345
All of these logically flow as potential

69
00:04:41,345 --> 00:04:47,524
solutions to the barriers she has expressed.

70
00:04:47,524 --> 00:04:51,203
No just you know in this case the husband is also a drinker, so

71
00:04:51,203 --> 00:05:00,488
I'm giving you a little bit of background information to help you here.

72
00:05:00,488 --> 00:05:02,922
What are the reflections you could use that could be introduced with,

73
00:05:02,922 --> 00:05:08,484
given what you've said.

74
00:05:08,484 --> 00:05:12,809
Well given what you've said, it might be helpful to get your husband on board

75
00:05:12,809 --> 00:05:16,533
to see if maybe he would be willing to quit with you at the same time or

76
00:05:16,533 --> 00:05:18,208
at least not try to tempt you.

77
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:23,411
Another action reflection could include,

78
00:05:23,411 --> 00:05:28,894
finding some ways to handle your withdrawal,

79
00:05:28,894 --> 00:05:33,827
might be helpful and encouraging to try.

80
00:05:33,827 --> 00:05:36,905
Take a look.

81
00:05:36,905 --> 00:05:41,771
Now this one's gonna lend itself to both an action reflection and

82
00:05:41,771 --> 00:05:44,695
a cognitive a B goal as well as a do goal.

83
00:05:44,695 --> 00:05:47,587
Let's see if we can flesh that out here.

84
00:05:47,587 --> 00:05:50,081
So notice the all or nothingness that we're addressing.

85
00:05:50,081 --> 00:05:53,604
So cutting out all sweets doesn't seem to work for you.

86
00:05:53,604 --> 00:05:57,800
Finding a way to lose weight might include having sweets once in a while, moderation.

87
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,224
And cognitively approaching this as an all or

88
00:06:00,224 --> 00:06:02,980
nothing thing doesn't seem to be working for you.

89
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:07,194
It creates what we call absence violation syndrome, when you set up an unrealistic

90
00:06:07,194 --> 00:06:10,215
standard of perfection, you deviate from that standard.

91
00:06:10,215 --> 00:06:13,691
You have what the hell reaction which often leads to full out relapse.

92
00:06:13,691 --> 00:06:17,977
That's all or nothing thinking or abstinence violation syndrome.

93
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:26,580
Take a look at this client.

94
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:32,465
Well, can you reflect back to this person?

95
00:06:32,465 --> 00:06:35,962
Well, first of all let's establish sort of the emotion of the case,

96
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:40,067
it's frustrating for you that there's always unhealthy foods in the lounge and

97
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:42,264
you really want to eat better change talk.

98
00:06:42,264 --> 00:06:46,273
So coming up with a way to reduce that temptation seems like it might be we're

99
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:49,232
talking about for example, bringing your own snacks.

100
00:06:49,232 --> 00:06:52,599
Talk to your office mates about offering more healthy options.

101
00:06:52,599 --> 00:06:56,187
Or yourself trying to eat it less frequently or smaller portions.

102
00:06:56,187 --> 00:06:58,936
So the top part is the change talk.

103
00:06:58,936 --> 00:07:02,699
We wanna reflect back their intention and their interest in change and

104
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:06,794
their frustrations, the bottom three are the actual action reflections.

105
00:07:06,794 --> 00:07:09,508
That concludes our practice of action reflection.

106
00:07:09,508 --> 00:07:12,823
We hope we've shown you how to create the action reflection so

107
00:07:12,823 --> 00:07:16,473
that it makes sense to introduce it with the claws, given you said.

108
00:07:16,473 --> 00:07:20,112
The action reflection should flow from what the client has said,

109
00:07:20,112 --> 00:07:22,902
it should not come across as unsolicited advice.

110
00:07:22,902 --> 00:07:26,268
Use tentative language like, might, possibly and could,

111
00:07:26,268 --> 00:07:32,619
and try to build options or a menu of change that they can select.
