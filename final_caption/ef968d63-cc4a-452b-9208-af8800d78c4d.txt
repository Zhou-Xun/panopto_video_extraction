1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:08,040
Yeah. This is very weird.

2
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:14,400
So what I'm talking about are these right here, the additional resources. You didn't see those or have access to those?

3
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:19,950
Maybe this is what's important for the exam. Yeah, it is important.

4
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:26,370
But I remember when I was recertifying through the online modules, they gave everyone access to these.

5
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:30,810
So maybe those hunt around. I can't remember where they're located, so I apologize.

6
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,299
But one of the ones I was interested in knowing if there were updates and I research this

7
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,720
extensively because I want to make sure I'm telling everyone the correct information,

8
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:48,180
but I want to make sure that this document is up to date. I couldn't find anything in my research, but if you come across it, let me know.

9
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,170
And if you could share it with me via email, attach it. That would be awesome.

10
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,560
I don't think there are any updates. I think this one is the most recent one,

11
00:00:55,830 --> 00:01:01,500
but it's really important that you have the most up to date one of this update of the food code because that's really important for the exam.

12
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:10,530
And then I mentioned this, the last class, but this document right here, this supersedes some information and the additional resources section.

13
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:17,130
So search save is great. I love it. But they don't do a really great job about updating all of their handouts.

14
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,810
So what they did is they put all the updates in this handout, but not in the other one.

15
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:27,750
So you kind of have to like do like a walk through side by side with this one and then any other

16
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,530
additional resources to make sure you're getting the correct information that makes sense.

17
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:36,090
Wow. Okay. So keep that in mind. There's people here not here today.

18
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:40,889
Let them know, too, because that's very, very important. Reiterated to me.

19
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:44,490
Go to your dashboard. And then up in the corner it's a student.

20
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:48,149
If you still have student that has resources, then you go down.

21
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:55,640
It has a bunch of different like taking industry lingo so responsible overall they have a bunch of different ones.

22
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:59,850
All look for the update. Okay, great. Thanks and thanks for telling us how to find that.

23
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:07,670
And then is that just information in addition to what they like they would have already gone over to in the modules, right?

24
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,380
Like that information? Or is that like in addition. Yes, no, it's going to just because I'm thinking like really don't know.

25
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:16,469
So I was like I, I will look at that, but I just want to make sure that it's not like new information.

26
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:21,270
Yeah. No, it's just reinforcing what's in the modules. So if you want a handout, it's here.

27
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,370
They are done really nicely. They're easy to read.

28
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:33,200
Dave On any of these little documents, you're saying that the update of 2018 may not reflect on this little I mean,

29
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:39,930
so this one, this is a document where they they give updates, oh, for each of the chapter.

30
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:43,020
So here is new content that's been added to this section.

31
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:47,399
So if this information is in one of the other handouts, trust this.

32
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:53,040
Trust this one. Yep, exactly. All right, cool.

33
00:02:53,820 --> 00:03:01,559
Thanks, everyone, for getting answers. Save Assignment one. I'm looking forward to looking at your responses before we get started with our content.

34
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:07,080
They first serve save any questions about the modules, serve save in general.

35
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:12,840
Any hiccups you went through this past week?

36
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:17,750
Now everything's peachy. Perfect.

37
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:21,380
Okay, well, let's get started.

38
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:34,020
So today we're going to go through greatest hits for modules one, two and three.

39
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:39,450
We're going to talk a little bit about food service huddles, which is not technically a source of content,

40
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:43,079
but it's more of an application that you might see in the real world, or maybe you've seen it already.

41
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,590
For those of you who have worked in food service or new breakout activity,

42
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:50,750
it's a little bit longer historically of getting the students like 45 minutes to do this,

43
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:55,590
probably not that long, because I want to give us a chance for groups to share what they come up with.

44
00:03:55,890 --> 00:04:01,800
But you're basically going to be coming up with a food safety in the service that you can actually present to a group of food service workers.

45
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:06,810
So it's not graded. It's just it's for fun and to apply what you learned this past week.

46
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:12,840
And it's kind of neat to see what your classmates come up with also. So that's next and then we'll finish up.

47
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:19,590
So is the plan. So the services C section is a little bit different than our other sections.

48
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:24,600
This is kind of a flipped classroom approach, as you've seen. So you're learning the content in the modules.

49
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:27,629
We're coming to class, we go over what we call the greatest hits.

50
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:32,190
So we're going to go over just key concepts that you should keep in mind when you're studying for the exam,

51
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,810
and we want you to be able to apply it to real life. That's the most important part, right?

52
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:41,490
Obviously, we want you to pass a service exam as the purpose of doing it this way.

53
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:45,999
But we want to be able to reinforce those concepts that you're learning. I know sometimes it can get kind of boring.

54
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,520
You're going through the modules or clicking a lot, even though the survey results are kind of entertaining.

55
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,750
Right? I thought they were pretty well done when I took it. I was impressed.

56
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:59,459
I love the I love Happy Man. Is that. Yeah, I like I like seriously all that.

57
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:03,330
Well, like it was great, but it's pretty well done.

58
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:07,730
It's not super boring, but we want to be able to talk about it again and reinforce it.

59
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:12,630
Gives you opportunity to ask questions to. Disclaimer down below.

60
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:17,159
So these sessions, these lectures we have after the modules, we're not going to cover everything.

61
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,340
So take really good notes, use those note taking guides.

62
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:27,180
If you don't like them, take your own notes, but you got to make sure that you're doing a little bit more than just focusing

63
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:31,310
on what we're talking about today and then use those practice exams that I have.

64
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:36,000
So I think there's three or four. The keys are there, the good to go over.

65
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:41,010
That gives you a good example of what the questions are going to be like. So again, this is not difficult stuff,

66
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:45,329
but they can ask questions in a tricky format and so it's good to get used

67
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:48,240
to knowing what those questions are going to be like when you take the exam.

68
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:58,960
Brody so greatest hits today or talk about do you use foods or to talk about the types of contaminants?

69
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:03,129
Oh, go ahead. Yeah. How many shutdowns and. Oh, jeez, I forget.

70
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:06,550
No, I don't remember. But I could tell you later.

71
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:14,380
Yeah. Let me make a note. I want to say it's something like 94, 70 to 90.

72
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:21,670
What they also do is they have historically they've had like ten ungraded classrooms that are mixed in.

73
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:25,570
So you don't know the kind of test questions to use in future exams.

74
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:29,470
So there's ten extra questions that are not graded, but you don't know what they are.

75
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:33,640
But I think it's anywhere from 70 to 90 and you get 2 hours to do it.

76
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:37,989
Yeah. Good. Um, what else?

77
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:43,150
Supplements. We're going to talk about the acronyms that Tom and then we'll go over hand-washing.

78
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:50,460
Okay. So six foods to see us.

79
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:59,310
Want to remember that the tea stands for two teas, the time and temperature and for controlling time and temperature for safety of foods.

80
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:06,030
We use the term TCS for that phrase, but then we also can call foods US foods,

81
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:11,190
and those are foods that bacteria and pathogens can grow really, really quickly.

82
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:19,920
Right. So TCS foods are more prone to being the cause of a foodborne illness outbreak, but are not just food, not non-tax food.

83
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:27,260
We want to make sure that we are preventing foods from becoming unsafe to eat so

84
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:32,870
foods can become unsafe to eat if time and temperature are abused from the modules.

85
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:37,250
And from your experience, what are some examples of of temperature abuse with foods?

86
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:45,560
What can you think of? So we would have a symphony of a food like like chicken Alice.

87
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:49,020
But for too long for kids to grow. Yep.

88
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:55,010
Yeah. What else? Another example of temperature abuse.

89
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,010
Are you tired or temperatures are to all the foods so temperature abuse of the food.

90
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:07,629
Yeah. Not a lot of you go the furthest in the cool enough before.

91
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:13,360
Pretty much different. Yep. Those are kind of both the temperature and time that you can have situations where they're both kind of combined.

92
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:17,500
But those are good examples. So food's being cold or reheated incorrectly.

93
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:26,680
It's held at the wrong time. So I think it's next week where learn about different protein based foods and how long we need to heat them to be safe.

94
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:31,089
And for how? How many seconds? How many minutes? So let's say you have a piece of meat.

95
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:38,110
It's supposed to be held at 165 for 5 seconds, but you essentially hold it at 145 for 5 seconds.

96
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:46,149
That food is at risk for being time and temperature, because we also want to make sure about this temperature danger zone.

97
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:52,630
So for the sake of serve, say this temperature danger zone is 41 to 1, 35 degrees, and definitely notice for the exam.

98
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:59,980
What you also want to know is this range to the bacteria can grow even more quickly and that's 70 to 1, 25 degrees.

99
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:08,780
So temperature, danger zone 41 to 135. Really, really danger zone is 70 to 125.

100
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:19,290
And that's the range that bacteria is going to grow very, very quickly and it's at even more risk for well before putting it in the fridge.

101
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:22,770
I feel like we didn't really talk about that. That's a really good question.

102
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:29,590
That's come up in the past too. So when you put a food, I imagine you've made the pasta, it's hot.

103
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:33,510
You put it in separate containers, right. And you want to put it in many separate containers.

104
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:39,110
You want them to be shallow and you would want them to be in a container where air is going to.

105
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,310
It's going to perpetuate airflow to cool it down.

106
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:49,290
But if you put that like this, so you put your pasta sauce in a huge vat that's hot, and you put it in your your walk in cooler,

107
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:55,770
you're at risk for reducing or increasing the temperature of that walk in cooler and you're putting your other foods at risk.

108
00:09:56,550 --> 00:10:02,820
That makes sense. Yeah. The other reason is if you put it very, very hot in that cooler,

109
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:09,210
the cooler might not have the capacity to cool down fast enough so it could hang out in that danger zone even more quickly.

110
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,440
That makes sense. That's a really good question.

111
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:18,209
I'm glad you brought that up because the way you put the hot food in a container and in the cold environment,

112
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:26,580
constant condensation will form trapped in the hot food that just creates the bacterial environment because it's moist, right?

113
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:32,190
Yes. Yeah. Because executive decision with room temperature, I mean, surrounding temperatures get good.

114
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:37,860
And that's why we have special equipment like a blast chiller. And maybe some of you have seen that in a food service operation.

115
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:47,760
That's where we can show the food down very, very fast. A blast chiller is used entirely for that purpose, and you could put food on very quickly,

116
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,820
but you wouldn't want to put it in a walk in cooler because it's just not made to do that.

117
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,390
Right. Good questions.

118
00:10:54,690 --> 00:11:03,070
So what are some examples of TCS foods? It can be time and temperature abused and dairy products.

119
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:08,100
Yep. So milk yogurt. Right. Good. What else is.

120
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:12,430
Yep. Definitely eggs. Yeah. What was that?

121
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:14,740
Wait for me. Yes. Definitely meat.

122
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:25,630
So animal products typically also fruits and veggies that have been washed, even though if they're whole bakery items,

123
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:31,120
deli meat, any food that's going to be eaten without any further prep, that could be a TCS food.

124
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:37,719
Spices. Seasonings, a11 that you want to keep in mind are cooked veggies.

125
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:45,100
So heat treated plant based foods like a cooked carrot. That would be a TCS food, a big one that you might see on the exam.

126
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:51,880
Or if you're in food service later in life and you're going through a like a health survey or with the county,

127
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:57,009
they look for sliced tomatoes and making sure that those are are at the right temperature slice.

128
00:11:57,010 --> 00:12:03,700
Tomatoes are a big one for TCS foods and having bacteria proliferate quickly slice melons.

129
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:07,000
That's also a huge TCS food leafy green sprouts.

130
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:11,530
Want to keep in mind, too. So this is maybe a trick question that they might ask you.

131
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:16,270
Flour, whole apples, whole raw carrots that are untreated.

132
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:22,149
Those are not TCS foods. Okay? That's because they can stay out room temperature.

133
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:26,260
They're cool, they're good. They're not going to proliferate bacteria quickly.

134
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:32,860
One that they probably mentioned in the modules is untreated garlic and oil with that at risk for.

135
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:37,290
Well, no. Or is it safe?

136
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:42,360
So untreated garlic and oil. What does that at risk for anyone?

137
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,980
Know what? Foodborne illness. No sort for botulism.

138
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:54,299
Okay. Yeah. So there's a lot of companies out there who are making their own infused oils with garlic.

139
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:58,080
And while they're very delicious and yummy, you want to make sure that the company is doing it right,

140
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:01,530
because that is a prime environment for botulism.

141
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:08,399
The form of botulism is a very, very dangerous foodborne illness. It can happen or small small amounts can make a reaction happen.

142
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:12,299
It can often be very deadly. Um. What else did I have here?

143
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:16,010
Big potatoes, tofu, soy items, meat alternatives.

144
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:21,170
Those are also us foods. What else?

145
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:25,229
Oh, so we want to talk about different populations that are more at risk for foodborne illness.

146
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:29,100
Right? So when we talk about those populations, we're thinking of the very, very young.

147
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:33,240
We're thinking of the very, very old. So obviously very young people.

148
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:40,080
Their immune system is not as robust. They can't fight off those toxins that they might encounter in the in the environment and in the world.

149
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:47,430
Very old people aging have a lower immune system, unfortunately, than we also want to think about people who are immuno compromised.

150
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:54,030
So people who have HIV, AIDS, cancer are going through chemo, radiation, people who have received transplants.

151
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:58,530
Right. So kidney transplant, lung transplant, and then people taking certain medications.

152
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:03,660
So those are the groups that are more at risk for acquiring a foodborne illness than than other folks.

153
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:15,559
And the other two food questions. You all have good questions, so thank you for that oily garlic thing you were talking about.

154
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:21,800
Are the untreated? Is it because of the like garlic that's put in mainly or I'm just going to use like what's causing that?

155
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:27,500
It's, it's the environment usually. So the it's an anaerobic environment.

156
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:35,360
So very it's not very acidic. So and I talk about in a second, but it's the fact that it's anaerobic.

157
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,930
It's, it's. It doesn't have assets to combat that.

158
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:45,630
That's mostly why. A good question. So when we were preparing the oil.

159
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:53,520
Sometimes their rosemary and they're confused and there's different things but only the garlic where we're told is going to be poison.

160
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:57,660
So don't do it. But other herbs. Okay.

161
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:01,250
Interesting. I don't know much about that.

162
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:05,970
But to do it is poisonous. But they tell me and it's okay to use it.

163
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:09,860
Like within a few days. But it's when we're. We have, like, garlic.

164
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:15,870
It's been infused in oil that we've done our own. I wouldn't use it over a week or ten days.

165
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:22,710
Question Which is garlic is you can do other things. You can do ginger, you can do all that, but not always.

166
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:28,070
That's just not valid. That's good to know. I'm going to look that up later too. I mean.

167
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:34,360
Yeah. So erm you said bakery items are an example of a takes business,

168
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:39,899
but like in bakeries you often see them locked out at room temperature for a long time.

169
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:44,490
So I was just wondering about that. That's true. That was mentioned in SERP Save.

170
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:50,700
But now that you bring that up, it's a really good point. Um, an example of a ready to eat with bankruptcy.

171
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:59,570
I don't know that they meant that as a tax burden. I mean, I would say it's definitely a saw in the surface of content.

172
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:07,579
It could be because there are often like like a bakery item could be a mixed product, but there could be milk items.

173
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:15,140
And now I'm thinking of like a frosting that maybe should be refrigerated, but maybe we leave it out for a few hours for people to buy.

174
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:20,160
That's my thought on. And why does it help? Yeah.

175
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,250
A little bit. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. It's.

176
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:31,660
It's kind of that gray one. Yeah. Yeah. Like you said, that if it doesn't need any further processing, it should be safe.

177
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:39,230
However, like you said, they may be cream's hub and also about the moisture in these cookies won't be leave out for a day.

178
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:51,680
Exactly. Yup. Yeah. So their natural natural born to us today when they roll it through or look like try to grow the toxins in the garlic.

179
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,390
I know I don't I have no idea. That's a really good question.

180
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:02,210
I'm not a botulism are both types of expert. Is there natural Botox?

181
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:07,400
Is that a thing like natural or synthetic or like the more I have no idea.

182
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,969
So I'm going to Google this later. Yeah, I don't know.

183
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:17,850
But maybe I'm putting garlic and oil into this one more and then we're going to move on.

184
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:29,030
Yeah, but when we buy the farm market Exxon and we say that we can leave them on for weeks so babies being washed then will have to put in the fridge.

185
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:34,540
Right. This is like a fruit and wash is okay.

186
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:38,640
Yeah. And it definitely depends where you're you're getting your eggs from too, so.

187
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:41,910
Good point. All right.

188
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:45,549
So moving on, the contaminants we're talking about biological first.

189
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:52,350
So we have four types. We have bacteria, viruses, parasites, fungi, molds, yeast that can grow.

190
00:17:53,010 --> 00:18:00,540
We also want to keep in mind plants so things like mushrooms and then shellfish that is maybe coming from contaminated water.

191
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:06,330
So those are other opportunities where biological contaminants could enter the food system and create some issues.

192
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,680
The models also talked about the Big Six. Definitely know this for the exam.

193
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:18,419
You want to know these, you don't need to know a lot of details, but you want to know how it's spread and maybe an example of that.

194
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:23,250
Okay. And then also we know what kind of symptoms it causes, too.

195
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:27,090
So the last two here have a and norovirus.

196
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:33,479
Both require a living host to grow and proliferate. It's also they're both spread by feces.

197
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:38,010
So know that also neuro virus is a little unique.

198
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,990
I like to call this the cruise ship virus. The cruise ship.

199
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:49,260
The thing someone said, yes, but this norovirus can spread through airborne particles that are found in vomit.

200
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:53,550
So this is spread very quickly, especially in areas that it's very compact,

201
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:59,460
like a cruise ship eating a lot of ready to eat foods, a lot of different kinds of foods on cruise ships, too.

202
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:08,790
People are packed like sardines in a cruise, which are wonderful, don't get me wrong, but you're more at risk to encounter foodborne illness.

203
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,280
And those situations both are also spread through contaminated, ready to eat food.

204
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,010
And then the shellfish from contaminated water as well.

205
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:26,500
With these other up here shigella commonly spreads what commonly spread by flies, so you might see that come up.

206
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:31,840
Salmonella is commonly linked to the ready to eat foods non-household oil.

207
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,860
Salmonella is most often linked to poultry products.

208
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,979
And then our famous E coli right here, ground beef. Right.

209
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:45,459
So I'm pretty sure we've all heard of some ground beef not being cooked the correct temperature and seeing hearing about e coli outbreaks in the news.

210
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:52,240
Right. All of these if someone in your food service establishment acquires one of these, they stay out.

211
00:19:52,240 --> 00:20:00,160
We don't want them. Even if we're short staffed, we don't want them to come to work because they're so easily transmissible to other people.

212
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,690
It can spread very quickly.

213
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:07,750
It could totally wipe out your food service department and no one will be working and no one will get any food and people will be sad.

214
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:12,580
So keep the people out of the operation. Something to keep in mind too.

215
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:17,320
So have a there is a happy vaccine. Maybe some of you have gotten it before.

216
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:22,090
Yeah. So a lot of food service establishments will actually cover.

217
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:26,110
So the department will cover to get food service workers the happy vaccine for free.

218
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:31,179
I believe it's a series vaccine, but that's something good to know too.

219
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:37,090
There is a vaccine to help prevent that, which is great. Some of the foodborne illness can be very effective.

220
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:37,479
Right.

221
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:45,640
And if any of you have been unfortunate enough, myself included, to experience an illness, it can be very, very debilitating, very, very painful.

222
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:50,889
And sometimes you could have a foodborne illness and not even know it because you

223
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:54,700
think you got a little stomach bug and you're still able to go about your day,

224
00:20:54,700 --> 00:21:02,650
but maybe you just have a little bit of a stomach upset. But things like diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, jaundice, yellowing of the skin,

225
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:08,140
whites of the eyes, those are signs of foodborne illness, abdominal cramps.

226
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:13,389
So again, kind of telltale symptoms. But again, they're symptoms of a lot of different things.

227
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:17,350
So it could be a symptom of a cold or flu or COVID.

228
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:23,650
There's so many different things out there we often don't know and it's hard to test if something is a foodborne illness.

229
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:28,330
If you're not getting like a x ray scan and someone see in your insides.

230
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:39,729
Another thing that makes foodborne illnesses harder to diagnose is just the pure like onslaught of disease that you might way to experience symptoms.

231
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:45,280
So I was out to dinner last Saturday with a group of friends and we all got home maybe

232
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:49,749
was like an hour after we had had dinner and my one friend texted us and she's like,

233
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:52,780
Wow, I just love that because you just had a lot of diarrhea.

234
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:56,109
I wonder what it was. Maybe it was something I ate and none of us felt sick.

235
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:59,510
So we're like, okay, maybe it was the lettuce you had in your salad. So that's an example.

236
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:05,320
Very, very quick turn over. Someone could have symptoms from a a biological contaminant within half an hour.

237
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:09,130
Right. And that's when, you know, it was probably something. Right?

238
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:15,999
Maybe there's a, you know, a time up to six weeks where you might not show symptoms.

239
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,030
And that's where it gets even more difficult to pinpoint if it was a food that kind of caused an issue.

240
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,040
Is it something else?

241
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:29,640
And that's why it's so hard to contain foodborne illnesses and outbreaks, because if people aren't showing symptoms until a month,

242
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:34,750
six weeks, it's harder to track down where the food was, what was it, who ate it.

243
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:40,720
And that's why it's really important that our government is up on notifying everyone of outbreaks very quickly

244
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,130
and proactively so we can get that food out of the food system and prevent people from getting getting sick.

245
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:47,950
Interesting fact about foodborne illness outbreaks.

246
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:54,370
I noticed this and read about this because I am a food service nerd and maybe some of you notice this as well.

247
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:57,100
But during the COVID pandemic, sometime in 2020,

248
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:05,260
there were actually fewer reported foodborne illness outbreaks like formal outbreaks because, one, we had labor cuts.

249
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:11,140
Two, we are efforts were pointed toward COVID, getting a vaccine, public safety measures.

250
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:15,700
So we had fewer reported foodborne illness outbreaks because of COVID.

251
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:19,780
But that doesn't mean that they weren't happening. They're just going unnoticed, unreported.

252
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:24,670
But interesting to think about how COVID has impacted food service.

253
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:32,070
Well, next we got Tom.

254
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:39,030
So there's acronyms in to help you remember the six conditions that affect the growth of bacteria in the foods that we want to keep in mind.

255
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:43,860
All right. Here. So food, we want to know if it's TK's food or not.

256
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:53,540
It stands for acidity. So we mentioned before p h and so bacteria doesn't grow best in a huge range of 4.5 to 7.5.

257
00:23:53,540 --> 00:24:02,360
And then foods that are very basic are very acidic. They're going to be less at risk, too, to harbor those pathogens, time and temperature.

258
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:03,830
We talked about those a lot already.

259
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:10,670
So keeping food out of the temperature danger zone, limiting time that food is spending in the temperature danger zone as well.

260
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:16,250
And then the last two, so oxygen and moisture, these talk about an environment that bacteria love.

261
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:21,260
They love to proliferate in environments that are high in oxygen.

262
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:25,130
They replicate a lot quicker and environments that have a lot of moisture.

263
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:33,050
So think of a rain forest that's moist. It has a lot of oxygen, a lot of mold and yummy stuff growing in there, too, right.

264
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:37,940
You don't want that on your food. So you don't want an environment that is high in oxygen, high in moisture.

265
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:45,170
We also want to make sure that chemicals aren't getting into our food.

266
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:50,000
And when we're talking about this, we're not talking about, oh, I actually poured some sanitizer in the soup.

267
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:54,680
It's because we're using so many chemicals and food service to make sure that

268
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:59,750
that operation is safe and that we're serving safe food to our to our customers,

269
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:04,709
things like chemical sanitizers, cleaners, polishes.

270
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:08,330
So we do a lot of polishing of our hoods and stoves.

271
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:13,670
So that's why it's really important to make sure that food service staff are trained on how to use them properly.

272
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:22,430
That usually involves using gloves or special mitts or ice shields so it doesn't get into their body,

273
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:27,830
making sure that as a manager or if you're a dietitian or food service,

274
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:31,670
you want to make sure you're watching staff that they're using chemicals correctly,

275
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:34,969
because a lot of times you'll do training and then things get busy, right?

276
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:41,629
There's staff turnover. You might forget to train a new employee. So you want to make sure you're watching your staff to make sure that everyone

277
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:44,870
is being safe not only for themselves but for the food service environment.

278
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:52,969
Two other items so kitchenware that have the risk of spreading chemicals to food.

279
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:57,470
So pewter. Pewter has a a really low melting point.

280
00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:05,209
So imagine that you have a pewter bowl. You put a cup of steaming hot soup in there that obviously is going to increase the risk of yummy,

281
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:08,300
putrid chemicals that you don't want in your food getting in there.

282
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:15,080
Right. Pewter also used to contain lead and sometimes pewter objects that might still contain gloves.

283
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:20,540
So that is obviously a no no and consumption for people, untreated copper.

284
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:32,629
So untreated copper, food plates, glasses, they need to have a a liner of a non-reactive metal in order to be used so you can use copper,

285
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:35,930
but it needs to have some kind of liner in there to make it safe.

286
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:40,220
Other kitchenware. So we have seen kitchenware.

287
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:44,180
That's a no for for eating off of the painted pottery.

288
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:47,810
So this is a common one. We have these beautiful painted pottery plates.

289
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:54,530
I just got a beautiful pottery mug from my boyfriend sister for Christmas, and I want to use it so badly.

290
00:26:54,530 --> 00:27:00,200
It's from Poland. It's gorgeous. I don't know if it's food safe, so I could use that.

291
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:05,899
I'm sure it's fine, but knowing what I know, I want to research it before I use it.

292
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:12,770
Right? So we need to make sure we look at the bottom of a cup of the plate of the bowl and make sure it's safe to use for food.

293
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:16,939
A lot of serving dishes, too. They're beautiful, but they need to be food safe.

294
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:21,290
So look on the bottom again. How do we practice safe chemical use?

295
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:22,759
We talked about a few of these already.

296
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:28,100
So training our staff, watching our staff want to make sure that we're getting chemicals from reputable vendors.

297
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:28,490
Right.

298
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:37,370
So you want to make sure it's a vendor that is well known, they're well established that they have chemical information for every single chemical.

299
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:44,630
We're going to talk about that later, not surfaces, but later in our on our other other content for the course.

300
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:49,100
I want to make sure we're storing chemicals in the correct manner.

301
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:53,450
So often we want them off the floor. Right, always off the floor.

302
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:55,669
So nothing leaks.

303
00:27:55,670 --> 00:28:03,830
We don't want them up very high because if we reach for them, we run the risk of pouring it on there on the floor and that can be very dangerous.

304
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:07,970
We also want to use chemicals for what they're used to do.

305
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:14,720
Right. So we have a sanitizer that's used to clean down your food service equipment.

306
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:18,950
We don't want to use that on a surface that we're maybe using to cut through.

307
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:26,870
That might not be okay. We want to make sure that we're only using, you know, cutting board safe or work area safe chemicals for that.

308
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:37,800
And that's mostly on that one. Any questions about. Chemical contaminants or other contaminants after.

309
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:46,240
Yeah. Like if someone has the pottery when they're selling it, do they have to have.

310
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:55,000
I'm guessing they I don't think they do. Like is there regulation on like I was thinking of like farmers markets or like, you know, things like that?

311
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:58,630
I don't know. I don't think there is a regulation to have it.

312
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,350
There should be. It's a good point. Yeah.

313
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:07,090
Always check where you can check their website too. I don't think there is a law for that.

314
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:12,760
Um, I got a pottery ball from like, there and,

315
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:22,330
and like he tried to specifically tell me that like the ball that I was getting because I was buying at a discount couldn't be used for really.

316
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:26,340
So I don't know. It's like that's just like their own ethical thing or not.

317
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:31,390
But like he was very like, I literally cannot tell you this unless you tell me that you are okay with it.

318
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:35,950
Be nervous. That's good. He told you? Yeah. Was it on the item or.

319
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:41,530
No. And so, no, I don't know. He was like he he typically wouldn't have sold it at all.

320
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:45,600
But I was like, I'm a really big nutrition nerd. I promise. I have other uses for this.

321
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:49,860
So but he was like, Yeah, usually I would not sell this and that.

322
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:54,160
Well, that's good. He told you to be careful, those pottery dishes.

323
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:59,230
Yeah, because I know some of these people who make this professionally and they said the

324
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:06,129
place they use a very toxic and so if he doesn't say that it's safe assume it is toxic,

325
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:10,240
especially if you use tomato sauce or anything acidic. I'm going to break it down.

326
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:16,840
Heavy metals right in your food. Yeah, that's a good the green part of those piles, the acid, those are color.

327
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:21,070
Even in the indigenous culture, they say they'll kill somebody.

328
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:26,980
Interesting. Don't use it. All right.

329
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:34,330
Our last contaminant, physical contaminants. So obvious things that you could find in your food stuffs, right?

330
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:38,410
So fruit pits or a big one. We're prepping a lot of foods in food service.

331
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:41,530
It gets it gets really easy to miss something like this.

332
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:46,209
There are peach pits, apple seeds, things like that.

333
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:50,650
They end up in there sometimes. Again, we're dealing with a large quantity of food.

334
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:54,940
A lot of people, a lot of busy things happening. It's easy to miss.

335
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,989
Another big one is bones from fish glass.

336
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:04,300
So I put this picture down here because we always want to make sure that when we're getting ice from an ice machine,

337
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:12,970
we're using a scoop and we never want to put a glass like a cork and scoop it in there because what can happen, the glass can break.

338
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:18,550
And now you have glass shards in your ice, and now you need to take all the ice out of your out maker.

339
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:23,739
You won't have ice for a while. People might be upset and you got to make more ice and you got to clean out that whole machine.

340
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:30,180
It's a pain. I've done it before, so make sure you use using a scoop metal shavings.

341
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:34,660
So right here it's kind of hard to see, but we have a metal sheathing and what looks like french fries.

342
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:40,330
I have those that easily can happen staple. So it can be kind of weird to think about.

343
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:43,330
How does a staple get in food? We're not dealing with paper, we're not in an office.

344
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:48,720
But there can be staples on boxes for shipping. You know, you're opening a box.

345
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:53,590
Your staple fly somewhere ends up in a pot of food. Okay, dirt.

346
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:58,569
We'll talk about hand-washing next as we make sure things are clean. In food service.

347
00:31:58,570 --> 00:31:59,830
Every kitchen is different.

348
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:09,249
There's different rules on how many bracelets you can you actually no bracelets should ever be yours except if it's a medical bracelet rings.

349
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:13,239
I want to say it's safe so's you can wear one like a wedding band type ring.

350
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:18,790
That's flat, but double check that one. So, like, rings like these, they would not be allowed.

351
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:23,140
No hair ties.

352
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:27,300
Sometimes we like to put hair ties on our risk. Those are no nos. Right.

353
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:31,330
It could fall under food. Yum. No fingernails.

354
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:38,080
Again, every kitchen has their own rules. Oftentimes you're not allowed to have nail polish because they have power strips.

355
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:45,940
I can get into stuff. I've been in some kitchens where you could have like a gel manicure because those are less prone to chipping.

356
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:54,549
Got to check the rules. Again, we always tell people to have their fingernails cut very low and no acrylic nails or long.

357
00:32:54,550 --> 00:33:00,790
Nails to banjos are also a big one. Again, rules are different everywhere, but typically you if you have a cut on your hand,

358
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:04,839
you can have a bandage on it, on it, but you need to have a glove over at all times.

359
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:09,219
So even if you're dealing with a food that you can touch with your bare hands,

360
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:14,230
you still always need to have a glove so that bandage doesn't fall off or any, you know, yummiest from your body.

361
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:21,210
Don't get on the food. Right. Okay. All right.

362
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:25,090
Now, last conservative topic for today is hand-washing.

363
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:29,130
So now these steps for the exam know them?

364
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:34,960
No. That you need to scrub your hands and arms for 10 to 15 seconds.

365
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:41,440
Okay, that's important. So you're scrubbing your hand or get into, you know, spacers down here.

366
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:45,520
That's where bacteria loves to be. You're kind of going up your wrist a little bit.

367
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:48,880
10 to 15 seconds sometimes. That's happy birthday twice. Right.

368
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:53,590
So keep that in mind. 10 to 15 seconds. When do we need to wash our hands?

369
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:59,540
That's an example. Before eating and after eating before or after eating.

370
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:04,930
I definitely have to go in the bathroom after having, like.

371
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:13,610
I've just got to look around and give anything raw, everything like trash or recyclables, anything dirty.

372
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:20,090
Also, when you're going from touching something dirty touches something clean.

373
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:27,020
So a lot of times servers will say there's a catered event as a banquet and your service going out, picking up dirty plates.

374
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:31,340
And then you also have those same servers serving them desserts.

375
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,520
Right? So they can pick up dirty plates and take them back to the kitchen.

376
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:40,130
They've got to wash their hands before they pick up the clean plates with cake on it and serving it to people.

377
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:45,379
So that's a big one too. And often you might forget that because you get caught up in the moment of serving and making

378
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:52,640
sure customers are served after touching electronic devices or phones or phones are filthy ill.

379
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:56,479
So you kind of wash your hands, okay. Especially in food service.

380
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,730
A lot of times kitchens will have rules. No phones out there.

381
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:07,190
Always out there. You always see a phone somewhere and you see people touch them during their break.

382
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:09,169
I know I've done it too.

383
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:15,470
And you probably have also, but you need to make sure you're washing your hands after touching your phone after handling money.

384
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:20,340
So if you're a cashier and you have a shift where you're handling money, money is also filthy, dirty.

385
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:24,980
So when you're once you're done, put away your cash or cash out.

386
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:32,089
Maybe you're doing another shift where you're working with food kind to wash your hands like we had all the other ones.

387
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:37,600
Bathroom is a big one. I think they had a nice visual of that and started to march.

388
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:42,459
All right. Also with going to the bathroom, this is something sort of they've mentioned.

389
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:45,600
So if you're ever wearing an apron, got to hang that up, right?

390
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:49,090
You cannot wear your apron in the luncheon. Yes. And with you.

391
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:57,640
It's supposed to be a clean, clean surface. Now, there are some situations where bare hand contact is okay.

392
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:02,470
You know, I remember when it's okay to use your bare hands and boots.

393
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:09,730
I know you're baking something. Like if you're baking bread, like you can need it with their hands and feet.

394
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:12,940
So, yeah, exactly. So anything that's going to be cut.

395
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:19,110
So bread. That's a great example. Mixed in a meatloaf. So mixing it up, it's going to be in the oven.

396
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:25,410
We're going to say something like making burgers when you're putting like some veggies into it and it's going to be custard.

397
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:32,720
Yeah, good. So burgers, it's cooked all the way. Adding cheese to a pizza, adding toppings to a pizza.

398
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:38,870
It's going to be put in an oven. Those are all situations where you can use your bare hands and you don't need to use gloves.

399
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:45,510
You can't you don't have to ask the questions on hand-washing.

400
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:49,470
I do so whenever I can. Preparing something for me.

401
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:55,830
Like they put the gloves on and they put some love in something or they have the look over for the bags.

402
00:36:56,340 --> 00:37:00,840
I saw them just open the doors in compartment with their gloves.

403
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:07,860
I says, Excuse me, how is that? Was that they always sanitize all the doors every morning are true?

404
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:14,660
Hopefully they're sanitizing sometimes, including all over the place and looking for a container.

405
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:18,410
Currently, you're not supposed to do that, so you're supposed to take off your glove.

406
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:25,980
Open the door. If they are sanitizing it before every shift, then it potentially would be okay.

407
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:34,340
I never see them do it. I know. So when they tell me this, I was wondering, is it true that the Magic Summer depends on the operation?

408
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:38,800
Yeah. Yeah. The other questions on hand-washing.

409
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:47,770
Right. So we're going to move on to talking about food service models.

410
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:51,370
Who is taking part in on a food service title before?

411
00:37:53,690 --> 00:38:01,340
And then no. Then I've kind of seen it, but w I wasn't really a part of that.

412
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:05,270
Okay. Or is anyone taking part in a huddle?

413
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:09,020
That wasn't for food service, so maybe. Yeah. What did you talk about?

414
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,860
I like just not the service related. Yeah, that's okay.

415
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:17,630
I guess with Dan's, like, operatic society. Well, I don't know.

416
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:25,340
We kind of get excited to talk about things. Right. Huddles are seen in a lot of different work environments, too.

417
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:29,120
A prime focus on the huddle is often safety.

418
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:34,910
So we talk about things that happened during a past shift that went awry.

419
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:46,280
So in a hospital food service environment, you might talk about, let's say, a a regular meal like a regular diet meal went to a cardiac patient.

420
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:50,950
That's a safety event, right? Because the foods on that tray could have been high in sodium.

421
00:38:50,960 --> 00:39:00,350
And this person needs a low sodium diet. You can talk about staffing changes for the day to kind of get your staff in the know what to expect.

422
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:06,110
We can talk about safety, things that might come up in that shift.

423
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:10,610
So maybe there's a certain situation that's going on that folks need to be aware about, too.

424
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:15,889
But usually the huddle, it's a it's a quick meeting. You're usually standing up because it's so fast.

425
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:25,940
It's usually maybe 10 minutes max. It's usually at the start of a workday, or it could be during a time where shifts are changing.

426
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:32,360
So we see a lot of huddles and nursing units in hospitals. So it's not only something that happens on food service on a nursing unit,

427
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:39,660
it happens when the late shift is is leaving and a new shift is coming in and they talk about patient care.

428
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,770
Right. So similar thing we can see see in food service.

429
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:48,230
Basic components of the huddle only work setting.

430
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:56,419
So again, like we said, discussed issues for the day, discuss things that are ongoing and being tracked so much later in the course,

431
00:39:56,420 --> 00:40:02,840
we're going to talk about metrics and we're going to talk about different metrics that can be tracked in a foodservice environment.

432
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:08,700
So one example is time that it takes to get a patient meal delivered to a patient.

433
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:11,780
Right. So a lot of hospitals have different standards.

434
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:17,270
So some say we need to get the meal to the patient at 45 minutes and that can be tracked over time,

435
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:22,190
sometimes by a dietitian and food service, sometimes by a manager in food service.

436
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:27,410
And since those items can be tracked, we can talk about these in our huddle and talk about how well we're doing,

437
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:32,720
or maybe we're falling short and we can talk about why that's happening. Great safety is a huge one.

438
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:36,950
So we can talk about maybe we got a new chemical in, right?

439
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:42,950
And no one's seen it before. We could do a safety in-service. We could talk about how to use the chemical when we use it, how to store it.

440
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:47,930
That's a prime time because you're hopefully having all of your employees at once there.

441
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:53,809
It can be very difficult to find a time to meet with food service staff because everyone is different chefs.

442
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:58,969
Everyone is doing something usually at one time, especially in a hospital.

443
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:03,260
Hospitals don't close, so there's never really a down period in a hospital.

444
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:10,130
It's also time to answer questions from employees. So it's a time where everyone is focused on one thing.

445
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:14,300
We step away from our work for a hot second and we can answer any questions.

446
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:19,160
And then it's also a good time to share any announcements so it can be a good teambuilding time.

447
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:22,250
So maybe someone has a birthday, maybe someone has an anniversary,

448
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,300
and that's a good way for your staff to get to know each other and kind of build some camaraderie also.

449
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:32,940
Some tips. Keep it short. You don't want to huddle to be long. 10 minutes max is what I would say.

450
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:37,110
Even like 5 minutes. 5 to 10 minutes is fine. Keep it focused.

451
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:42,809
It's not the time to go into long rants or long explanations about thing.

452
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:47,100
We want to deliver key information very quickly so people can get on with their day.

453
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:55,500
We want to be engaging, interactive and then hopefully and positive because you're setting staff off to serve people, right?

454
00:41:55,530 --> 00:42:02,009
To serve customers. So you wouldn't want to add a huddle and a super negative note because everyone's in a lead with a really bad vibe.

455
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:06,690
Right. And they could possibly spread that to customers. And that's an impact on your customer satisfaction.

456
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:18,330
So any positive is always, always a good idea. So we're going to show an example, two examples of pre shift huddles.

457
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:22,940
This is very weird. This is hard to do.

458
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:28,090
And when I was doing this, the sound was not working really well.

459
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:28,759
So we're going to try it.

460
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:37,250
But when we're watching this, keep in mind we're gonna see two different examples of pre-service huddles in a restaurant environment.

461
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:44,390
Think about what the manager is doing well in the huddle and think about what opportunities they have or what changes they could have made.

462
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:52,130
We're not going to watch the whole thing just a little bit. Let's try this out just a little bit.

463
00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:04,430
I'm riding my bike around pretty sharp. I wanted to incorporate more chocolate.

464
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:07,760
I never really had street parts. Okay.

465
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:19,100
I really hope people need to learn to pay more, to get more time to decide, not more time to come back with more ready for the perfect.

466
00:43:24,270 --> 00:43:28,230
But why was it? We have.

467
00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:34,690
I'm proud of you.

468
00:43:34,930 --> 00:43:43,630
That makes me happy when I see her at her apartment.

469
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:49,490
You were one of the nations. The Russians were tough on.

470
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:55,480
My mind was like a fish. We have my heart and my body.

471
00:43:56,310 --> 00:44:01,180
When? I mean let's move on. We have her thing.

472
00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:04,570
If I wanted to be a professional, could I do that?

473
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:13,770
Yeah. Perfect. All right. You're right. Not even the time horizon is exactly right, but make sure that we're doing our thing.

474
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:17,590
And on top of that. What was that thing? About 3.45?

475
00:44:18,970 --> 00:44:25,090
Well, get my salt shaker. As you can see, you certainly want to see competition.

476
00:44:25,570 --> 00:44:33,820
Yeah, I learned how to do on the cover of Hockey Night and how hard you work that customer service.

477
00:44:35,230 --> 00:44:43,510
That's why I should sacrifice get paid for being there.

478
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:48,480
Let's start talking about Regina. Your accent.

479
00:44:48,490 --> 00:44:59,410
I know we have here. This is our focus on the day to day active service checks is also reserved within 3 to 4 minutes, accompanied by the Marines.

480
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:08,780
Okay, we no longer take him to the big game, but we thank you for the last round.

481
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:14,260
We did invite you to ingredients in the way, but you know that we have you.

482
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:30,880
What type of preparation? I am filled with integrity and bringing my speech up and I reserve the right to marry.

483
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:36,310
Now, Margarita, you can tell me the ingredients that I've done on Rita.

484
00:45:36,790 --> 00:45:40,080
I see no one now.

485
00:45:40,090 --> 00:45:51,980
I see. I know he's our man, and he makes about 200.

486
00:45:52,170 --> 00:45:55,959
241.

487
00:45:55,960 --> 00:46:06,310
Yeah. Yeah, very true. And then we also have our second lady with the topic of the month that we have these days.

488
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:11,680
And the your legs are not with your back.

489
00:46:17,010 --> 00:46:23,430
Okay. I'm kind of goofy a little bit, but sometimes they are a little goofy.

490
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:26,680
That's okay. That makes it engaging and it makes people pay attention.

491
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:35,400
Right? Okay. So the first one, what are the manager do well in that situation, writing engagement.

492
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:39,899
How about, you know, so good.

493
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:43,910
She brought people and made them talk. Yeah. What else?

494
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:51,690
High energy has made it exciting. Yeah, there's music playing, which I don't know if it was only for the video,

495
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:55,229
but I think it was restaurant music kind of, you know, pumps it up sometimes.

496
00:46:55,230 --> 00:47:01,020
When I worked in hospital food service to kind of call everyone to the huddle will play music.

497
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:04,980
And sometimes we have an employee pick the song and makes it fun.

498
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:13,140
But what's good about that one? Yeah, she was able to play there and I don't think she is able to do it much.

499
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:20,639
And it's good practice. Right. And then even maybe someone is not really on their game, it creates opportunity.

500
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:24,540
It's a very like low and it's not a very intense situation.

501
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:29,260
So it's a learning opportunity if someone doesn't know, they're learning it from someone else.

502
00:47:29,310 --> 00:47:33,290
Right. Yeah. What could she have done better and then.

503
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:41,209
It's pretty good. She's very good. Yes, I know.

504
00:47:41,210 --> 00:47:47,780
It is something that she did. She says when you do this, more people will come and more money for you.

505
00:47:47,930 --> 00:47:54,980
Yes, they do. Did you see how excited they got to have the buy in?

506
00:47:55,130 --> 00:47:58,310
Exactly. And in the end, something about five.

507
00:47:58,610 --> 00:48:02,929
You get something? Yeah. So it was really good that she had a promotion for them.

508
00:48:02,930 --> 00:48:07,880
And we do that a lot. Yeah. And instead of especially in hospital food service, we've done that a lot.

509
00:48:09,110 --> 00:48:16,490
I've done a program where we've had employees like go above and beyond for a patient, so maybe, you know,

510
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:21,979
get them a special snack that they wanted or maybe there's something that they why it's not on the menu.

511
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:25,930
And so they go and ask the dietitian who's there, you know, can they have those?

512
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:28,900
How can we get them a portion that will fit within their diet?

513
00:48:29,630 --> 00:48:35,600
And they would rack up these above and beyond points and then they would, you know, be entered into a raffle or be able to win a gift basket.

514
00:48:35,870 --> 00:48:38,899
So incentives are huge to help with that. Okay.

515
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:44,590
The second one, what did that manager do? Well. Yeah.

516
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:52,720
Then he had the, I guess, the safety of the money. No, just like a way to keep teaching your employees, like keeping them up to date with things.

517
00:48:52,810 --> 00:48:57,960
Exactly. Yeah. And it's good if there is a little, like, a safety moment in each huddle.

518
00:48:57,970 --> 00:49:01,870
It doesn't need to be long. Right. Just kind of all over the brochure.

519
00:49:01,870 --> 00:49:05,710
Like, as a reminder, we got to live with, you know, our legs, not our back.

520
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:10,450
It doesn't need to be overly complicated, but if you keep doing that, every single huddle,

521
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:14,050
you keep safety top of mind, and then you're going to have less accidents, hopefully.

522
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:17,770
Which is always a good thing. But. Opportunities that he has.

523
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:26,520
But didn't you like. So much I feel like I'm him just pointing to the board that he has always taught me about.

524
00:49:28,390 --> 00:49:31,420
And then I guess, yes, the workers can go up and read it.

525
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:37,450
But yeah, it wasn't like it was like talking to the board and then talking about them before she was.

526
00:49:38,110 --> 00:49:41,740
It was good. But personally, I don't think he was as engaging as the first one.

527
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:51,010
I do a little bit more use the abuses and stuff because it would give them the answer was like the food.

528
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:54,400
He he talked more about the foods and I felt like letting was the first one.

529
00:49:54,790 --> 00:50:01,630
She was really like gave the person time to answer where the other one it seemed like it was like a in and then he was just like,

530
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:08,739
oh, let me just tell you what it is exactly. It's a group of people chance to talk, but again, maybe they're really pressed for time that day.

531
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:13,210
So maybe he's feeling that he, you know, but definitely could have a lot more time for that, too.

532
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:18,670
So good. Hopefully that gives you a good idea of what it can look like. So many different ways to do huddles.

533
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:24,309
Those are not the only ways for sure. Okay, so what time is it?

534
00:50:24,310 --> 00:50:30,430
Oh, perfect. Almost nine. We're not having a break this time because you can use the next,

535
00:50:30,430 --> 00:50:34,300
like half hour that you have with breakout groups to go to the bathroom, do what you need to do.

536
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:37,780
Okay. For those of you who weren't last week, we try to have a break.

537
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:41,259
This is a two hour class. It's really long, but we have a longer breakout session.

538
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:44,710
So that is our our compromise today. Okay.

539
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:55,090
So we are going to break out into, I think, about five different groups I mentioned last week.

540
00:50:55,090 --> 00:50:58,780
We're using this Google drive, these Google folders for a breakout activity.

541
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:03,550
So you can either click on the link. If you have the slides open, you can go to this URL.

542
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:10,870
If you don't have a computer with you, it's totally fine. You can still write down on a piece of paper so you can participate any way you want.

543
00:51:10,870 --> 00:51:15,879
But what you're going to do with your group, you're going to create an engaging, interactive,

544
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:21,370
very quick 3 to 5 minute food service, in-service, food safety and service, excuse me.

545
00:51:21,670 --> 00:51:26,320
And the this the intent of this is that it could be included into a daily huddle like we just saw.

546
00:51:26,410 --> 00:51:31,690
Okay. So want to be have you able to identify key aspects of your topic?

547
00:51:31,690 --> 00:51:37,030
So there's different topics down here. So teaches food, biological contaminants, chemical contaminants,

548
00:51:37,030 --> 00:51:45,999
physical and then handwashing and integrate that in service to share knowledge with the class or to your food service staff.

549
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,510
Right. And obviously, we want to apply information.

550
00:51:49,510 --> 00:51:53,740
We learn from the modules to this real life situation that you might see when you're out in the workplace.

551
00:51:55,090 --> 00:51:58,300
Make sure each group member has a role to play. Okay.

552
00:51:59,470 --> 00:52:02,990
I put 30 to 40 minutes. We're going to give you give you a little.

553
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:08,409
Yeah, 30 minutes, because I want to have time to share as many as as we can.

554
00:52:08,410 --> 00:52:12,340
We might not get to everyone but be ready to present because we might get to everyone.

555
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:17,230
So 30 minutes to create the in-service and then you're going to take turns presenting.

556
00:52:17,650 --> 00:52:21,640
All right. Okay. Any questions? No.

557
00:52:21,850 --> 00:52:25,899
Have fun with it. There's a lot of if someone's if you've already opened the document.

558
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:29,770
I have a lot of information there to help you. I'll be circling around.

559
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:33,430
You know, just have fun with it. It's not created.

560
00:52:34,270 --> 00:52:41,830
Just take your topic and think of a way that we could portray that to staff in an engaging way so people can remember it.

561
00:52:42,110 --> 00:52:46,729
Okay, great. So we're going to meet back up about 930.

562
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:50,680
Yes, maybe a few more minutes before 930, separating two teams.

563
00:52:51,010 --> 00:52:54,490
Oh, sorry. Yeah. Okay, let's go now. So start with one. We're going to go up to five.

564
00:52:55,630 --> 00:53:05,550
They were two, three, four, five, one, two, three or five, two, three, four, five.

565
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:09,170
One, three, four, five, four.

566
00:53:09,430 --> 00:53:17,050
One, two. Perfect. Okay. So, one, two, three, four, five.

567
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:29,890
In the middle. And if you need more space, you can go out in the hallways and go wherever you'd like to hear.

568
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:37,990
So, you know. I'm sorry.

569
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:48,720
I know you. Go ahead. It's great to have you all in one evening.

570
00:53:49,480 --> 00:54:06,610
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So the reason I think we're biological, let's just go right back in a room.

571
00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:29,140
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

572
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:37,500
That was an interception.

573
00:54:40,540 --> 00:54:51,730
Like, finally moving. They were.

574
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:22,350
Somehow I didn't think I could handle this all the time, so, yeah, I might reconsider that.

575
00:55:28,410 --> 00:55:48,450
Thing we're going to see. At the same time, I am doing it because it has great interest.

576
00:55:51,270 --> 00:56:10,120
And most important thing is that you listen to those who don't know if you will see the things that we don't like,

577
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:20,670
which is not something with an acquisition or high risk material.

578
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:32,459
Understand everything I heard about it, you know, where I looking for their frustration and influence.

579
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:44,250
And so we started doing work and that kind of thing when we were going to do something bigger and maybe like and why.

580
00:56:44,490 --> 00:56:50,490
But we don't have an agreement with those who have probably it is.

581
00:56:50,490 --> 00:57:15,510
I mean, this is about, you know, sort of shopping and even focus on money and then, you know, there's another other.

582
00:57:15,510 --> 00:57:23,920
But another way I would work on it.

583
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:42,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

584
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:47,910
Maybe you want to work on it or not.

585
00:57:48,190 --> 00:57:58,190
Yeah. Yeah. Prevent it and avoid the big things that I did.

586
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:20,540
But I did it with my, you know, and, you know, to keep everything they you know, there are things you don't like.

587
00:58:23,770 --> 00:58:27,980
Yeah, I have.

588
00:58:27,990 --> 00:58:36,770
No. Is one of the things that you just like.

589
00:58:38,650 --> 00:58:45,650
It's very 170 500 fans and I want to create a normal person.

590
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:51,620
I'd like to speak with his family.

591
00:58:55,130 --> 00:59:04,550
Isn't there something you want to reassure her to know?

592
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:17,059
Basically, you know, like how their son and daughter, etc., happened yesterday or this morning.

593
00:59:17,060 --> 00:59:32,200
It was just N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A.,

594
00:59:32,230 --> 00:59:47,030
N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A.,

595
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:52,200
N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A. From where you have to do this business,

596
00:59:52,270 --> 01:00:07,370
you want me to imagine that we can use whatever the people I know are easy for them?

597
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:15,500
Have something special.

598
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:23,890
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

599
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:33,850
Usually at the same time yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

600
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:40,600
That's right. That and then like preventive services, they all say, well,

601
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:53,080
I don't know here in one article I think that I would be very cautious and have that like saying, you know, if you're probably going to explain this,

602
01:00:54,670 --> 01:01:00,900
yeah, I'm going to ask something like, you know,

603
01:01:00,910 --> 01:01:17,799
something like those are you regardless or we just like that you're looking at a certain point as you come in and be a manager.

604
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:30,790
Like a couple of people have to be like, we are already on the radio show that I'm supposed to be on the right.

605
01:01:30,790 --> 01:01:44,710
Yeah, I know. I like, you know, I was like yeah I guess they're learned there and that right.

606
01:01:45,820 --> 01:02:01,230
Yeah. Yeah I remember think in the headline based on what we have is something like that so obvious.

607
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:06,370
So things that you do that I did last night.

608
01:02:07,670 --> 01:02:10,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

609
01:02:11,030 --> 01:02:15,230
I mean we have to keep it that way. I do.

610
01:02:15,250 --> 01:02:19,750
And I would, I would also like I would never told anyone,

611
01:02:20,610 --> 01:02:33,730
not that I never had like a big scene where you're like, know this is how well you would want to believe.

612
01:02:33,790 --> 01:02:43,570
I'm sure people would might make that mistake. If someone's on the other side, we could talk about something as simple as that.

613
01:02:45,670 --> 01:02:55,770
I remember that even during last night's it was during the day I was getting worried because what they were looking for.

614
01:02:56,470 --> 01:03:02,320
Yeah. I mean, so even are everything right. Like we're going to have to change like.

615
01:03:03,190 --> 01:03:07,659
Yeah. And so like I, I mean, yeah, no, no.

616
01:03:07,660 --> 01:03:17,770
But like, I could see it being kind of where it's like if we're going to like but like that, yeah.

617
01:03:18,850 --> 01:03:29,510
You're not targeting in the service setting, you know, like that a term to describe what I'm talking about but maybe not.

618
01:03:30,010 --> 01:03:42,010
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And I think people are now this is the only way you can actually.

619
01:03:42,260 --> 01:03:55,200
Oh, there's no more rush hour against what they're worried about for everybody.

620
01:03:55,780 --> 01:04:15,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

621
01:04:17,050 --> 01:04:22,720
And then I think Nigerians are right now functioning.

622
01:04:22,810 --> 01:04:30,320
Yeah. I'm like, I wouldn't want to do like demos or like, I don't really know what have you.

623
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:54,670
Well, I just put it to them. Yeah, like I just like, you know, I just know that the world is slightly open and I would just like to make up for it,

624
01:04:55,150 --> 01:05:00,230
because I just feel like if it's a check on anything, because that's what people want to do, like in the whole thing.

625
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:09,460
Yeah. But if we're like people in on it on the day and I like, I think that we went through yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

626
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:13,600
So I was like reprimanding anybody though. I just kind of and then.

627
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:17,650
Yeah, yeah.

628
01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:24,630
He's really into that. Yeah. Everyone we know right now.

629
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:35,050
You know, you have a friend like you.

630
01:05:35,150 --> 01:05:46,090
Like you have all of the men and women and women that I read in the program.

631
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:53,050
You like I like to say, you know, happy birthday to you and your food.

632
01:05:53,120 --> 01:06:06,489
Because I can end like getting in a butterfly when talking like you don't like I didn't find her like, yeah, even like a gay man.

633
01:06:06,490 --> 01:06:11,550
And, like, he's like, I don't know. That's, like, rooted in the village.

634
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:13,480
Yeah, I know.

635
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:20,950
But I think everybody needs to be like, you are going to have, like, a couple of questions tonight and then and I'll be like, just hot water.

636
01:06:20,950 --> 01:06:26,800
Yeah, that's kind of a weird way to call somebody.

637
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:35,530
They are not open to analyzing and like, we explain what we understand that way.

638
01:06:35,830 --> 01:07:01,920
Every one of us is the manager in the other room and I think I know everyone is.

639
01:07:02,010 --> 01:07:09,970
I don't think I can get it right.

640
01:07:10,090 --> 01:07:15,590
I was just about to start creating a farewell court and be like, Oh,

641
01:07:15,850 --> 01:07:31,120
no wonder you and that I don't know that you're gonna be like, I'm not doing that right.

642
01:07:31,570 --> 01:07:41,560
Okay, what do we want do as soon as I'm going to come after them, I don't feel.

643
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:47,470
During this lockdown, something like this.

644
01:07:47,540 --> 01:07:53,090
You know, whenever you are talking about something else, it doesn't contain it.

645
01:07:53,810 --> 01:08:03,470
I think for everyone watching, like what you just said, you know, like I just feel sorry for this.

646
01:08:07,070 --> 01:08:17,930
You know, this thing is just going to be like we have this every couple questions on every unit, depending on where you are.

647
01:08:18,110 --> 01:08:23,380
What are you guys doing? All right. What do you want to bring to this thing?

648
01:08:23,460 --> 01:08:30,500
Yeah, yeah. You're just doing it right in front of a so idea, and we want to use all of them.

649
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:34,510
I wonder if can help us. Yeah, yeah.

650
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:43,940
Oh, there is a way to know. I thought that much like what should happen is that.

651
01:08:44,260 --> 01:08:48,050
Thank you so much.

652
01:08:48,170 --> 01:08:51,390
Thank you so much. And you guys are.

653
01:08:53,210 --> 01:08:58,200
And that was my first proviso.

654
01:08:58,230 --> 01:09:04,550
We wanted to do that. I was flooded with.

655
01:09:11,190 --> 01:09:34,720
Okay. I just want to make sure that you don't do that and then just not, you know, like I know just two days ago that someone was ready to scrub.

656
01:09:35,590 --> 01:09:39,230
What's the word of somebody, Secretary?

657
01:09:39,870 --> 01:09:55,400
And I feel that this is I don't know, how do we get our attention for not wearing nothing more than that?

658
01:09:56,590 --> 01:10:00,560
Yeah. No, I was going to say current out like.

659
01:10:00,660 --> 01:10:04,460
But what if I need to like that? I don't know.

660
01:10:04,530 --> 01:10:10,260
Where do you think you're going with this thing?

661
01:10:11,190 --> 01:10:17,969
Yeah, well, you're going to go to Washington.

662
01:10:17,970 --> 01:10:27,240
And in New Hampshire, physicians are giving them when, when, when, when,

663
01:10:27,630 --> 01:10:37,410
like you want to find something where you can check yourself before you go to work or like you don't like to work in

664
01:10:37,410 --> 01:10:52,830
your journey even more than and try to do a lot of touching conventions through that is what if I have to a phone?

665
01:10:53,970 --> 01:10:54,360
Yeah.

666
01:10:54,370 --> 01:11:05,660
Like what the tomato should be, you know, and they can go out and think about anywhere like cover here in the kitchen, like your hair and whatnot.

667
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:19,290
What do we use to drive eventually? Become a culture that I never used to think.

668
01:11:19,290 --> 01:11:26,760
Starting to get a fresh one? I don't know. I just didn't do anything the first thing I do.

669
01:11:27,690 --> 01:11:33,600
Yeah. I learned how to drive here recently. Got a couple more look at your door.

670
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:41,200
I you know, you're driving a lot of resentment.

671
01:11:41,610 --> 01:11:52,040
The one thing that you guys have a note about that like having mindset after the desire

672
01:11:53,560 --> 01:12:08,460
to eliminate areas like what I do well they have all these around the as we know,

673
01:12:08,490 --> 01:12:13,430
at least another one really.

674
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:32,000
Anyone else do I have any information in my day?

675
01:12:32,040 --> 01:12:37,500
So the other day the answer is only show what we put in so we don't have to be like, oh, that's it.

676
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:58,120
Yeah. So that to me, I mean I feel like the National Grid and I'm sure you know 130 it in the paper.

677
01:12:58,170 --> 01:13:01,200
Yeah. And then it just doesn't seem right.

678
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:14,159
Yeah. Yeah. I just thought it was the way they came up with the telephone to increase the heat or more to make sure it's like they need you to.

679
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:20,750
Do you want to pose about that? You know something?

680
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:30,310
I think it would be doing a little of you and all the old saying goes a long way.

681
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:34,350
We have maybe like poor, really cool.

682
01:13:34,350 --> 01:13:43,500
In a proper shooting in your life, how do you feel to ensure that they are not want to cool down?

683
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:50,930
Nancy and that's going to take too long. They're going to want that person was.

684
01:13:51,060 --> 01:14:05,380
Yeah. Machine meaning that and then agreeing like how to prevent instantly like 670 501.82.

685
01:14:05,660 --> 01:14:13,480
Yeah. Yeah. Well, we never do nothing more than this.

686
01:14:15,190 --> 01:14:27,160
Yeah. Where we're used to the decisions that are made in ocean.

687
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:47,830
And the other part which would take place and I was in the 1970s,

688
01:14:47,830 --> 01:15:05,260
and every time I have the necessary infrastructure and guidance for the global economy, everyone's recommended something.

689
01:15:07,180 --> 01:15:23,590
So, you know, about 10 minutes. It's really strong action.

690
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:28,840
But, you know, let's say about being in a lot of action.

691
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:39,810
There have been 20 years and something that I can do, but I don't think that's all that.

692
01:15:39,970 --> 01:15:45,880
Well, we can also disciplines too.

693
01:15:46,060 --> 01:15:49,230
Yeah, I think that's right. That's right.

694
01:15:49,340 --> 01:15:58,070
Yeah. I mean, like, yeah, you know,

695
01:16:00,280 --> 01:16:22,050
when you go nowhere where you have to worry about doing anything dirty and then things like the government wasn't ready to take that, you know?

696
01:16:23,650 --> 01:16:29,220
Yeah, something like that.

697
01:16:29,350 --> 01:16:33,970
I'm like, you're going to have to learn to do this.

698
01:16:34,030 --> 01:16:38,110
Oh, well, yeah, yeah, yeah, right.

699
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:45,100
Maybe I'll just ask 139%.

700
01:16:45,150 --> 01:16:52,930
I yeah. Yeah, I will say yeah.

701
01:16:52,930 --> 01:17:04,660
Yeah. I think sometimes I would be like, where can I find information and what's wrong with one?

702
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:09,910
So it's like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

703
01:17:10,870 --> 01:17:23,110
I mean, I really feel like this is also going around about your word reminder that you know what is happening against,

704
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:32,410
you know, you're not good enough temperature where you weren't.

705
01:17:32,890 --> 01:17:40,030
So be sure to get something I believe in. It doesn't mean that maybe I will be things I like.

706
01:17:41,470 --> 01:18:05,590
This will usually you know, it doesn't want to be like they just think they are going to be like,

707
01:18:05,590 --> 01:18:10,490
oh, so we can okay, yeah, we can work with within hours.

708
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:21,100
And then you should think like ourselves to ensure that it's like 5 minutes.

709
01:18:21,100 --> 01:18:25,030
Everyone in Europe because it has to be.

710
01:18:25,210 --> 01:18:36,250
But, but I know you work for all the people who are here.

711
01:18:37,210 --> 01:18:45,660
So again. Yeah, so many.

712
01:18:47,590 --> 01:18:51,140
Yeah, but I think.

713
01:18:53,150 --> 01:19:00,090
Yeah. You can have it in a different place. Yeah, I really like that.

714
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:05,510
What kind of restaurant do we want to be in here?

715
01:19:12,740 --> 01:19:17,210
All right. That's a good idea.

716
01:19:21,020 --> 01:19:39,290
Yes. Okay. I'm going to give you an area, but where everything is.

717
01:19:39,290 --> 01:19:43,740
Okay, whatever it is, you have to go. Yeah, I know.

718
01:19:45,020 --> 01:19:48,050
And so.

719
01:19:49,740 --> 01:19:59,540
And then I like doing so like an like because we have a very different picture of how you drive.

720
01:20:04,310 --> 01:20:13,880
And if not, I mean, why should I just take care of it?

721
01:20:14,110 --> 01:20:17,180
I have to figure out, you know, time.

722
01:20:18,460 --> 01:20:26,210
Yeah, I know, right? Yeah.

723
01:20:26,630 --> 01:20:31,850
Then I'll be like, Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. My.

724
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:42,020
Can you tell us what you do? People who are good enough to use, you know, watching all that.

725
01:20:42,470 --> 01:20:47,120
And I can be like, I haven't got one second one or come inside.

726
01:20:48,890 --> 01:20:55,110
No, I didn't hear any of that.

727
01:20:55,630 --> 01:21:02,030
The probably like crazy. Right.

728
01:21:03,340 --> 01:21:13,830
Right. Right. So there is a. Is it in there?

729
01:21:15,260 --> 01:21:19,580
Okay. I think you wash your hands. Hey.

730
01:21:20,490 --> 01:21:24,070
Uh oh.

731
01:21:24,350 --> 01:21:27,890
Is that you? Yes.

732
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:35,420
Okay. So you want to ask me that? All over.

733
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:42,400
Oh, yeah. What do we have? That is a three year old.

734
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:51,970
So everything will be the next thing you know, you should ask me because I have surveys that I can tell you, you know?

735
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:59,170
Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's fun. If you are bored, I could pretend like it's a boy.

736
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:06,640
Yeah. Okay. You can represent me more. You can understand what I do, what I thought up.

737
01:22:06,750 --> 01:22:14,020
Like when I said, well, there's like four types of biological in every sector of life.

738
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:21,940
And there is this one guy, but we do have the Big Six, which is on our board here so that we take a look but under the prevention categories.

739
01:22:22,300 --> 01:22:35,310
Yeah, that's how very good we all were in the green room.

740
01:22:35,650 --> 01:22:43,480
Yeah, exactly. You know, you just get away with that.

741
01:22:47,830 --> 01:22:56,350
Yeah. That's like this is that. You know, we were like, I disagree when I said they are.

742
01:22:57,490 --> 01:23:01,930
Oh, that's a lot of money. Like an extra day every day.

743
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:11,000
I have a random number generator. It's ever going to go back to time?

744
01:23:12,090 --> 01:23:15,590
I do, too. Yeah.

745
01:23:15,940 --> 01:23:25,900
You to go first? Yes. All right. Give me time to set up anything or if you wanted to, you know, you could do whatever you want.

746
01:23:26,170 --> 01:23:33,620
You want to be from there. You know, you can stay there or you can come out there.

747
01:23:33,700 --> 01:23:36,880
You go out at night.

748
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:41,200
You just can't do the heavy underwear.

749
01:23:41,230 --> 01:23:44,290
I'm sorry. I have to. Is that. What's your topic?

750
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:59,500
Biological contaminants. Okay. I've always been like, if I can get away with and already ready to go.

751
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:06,010
Whenever you're ready. All right. We're both biological contaminants and pretending to work at a diner.

752
01:24:06,580 --> 01:24:10,720
And so I'm just disguise affected as a manager.

753
01:24:11,350 --> 01:24:14,919
Can you just let me know about time if go. Okay. All right.

754
01:24:14,920 --> 01:24:18,999
Diner divas. This is a chicken. You are set today.

755
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:25,960
It's so happy to have everybody here. We're going to do a little Jeopardy game based on biological, t and interest to test our knowledge.

756
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:33,330
And the winner gets to have an extra staff meal. What would you like to pick in the first category 400?

757
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:40,020
What's that? That's hundred. 400,000. The question is, what is the danger zone temperature?

758
01:24:40,070 --> 01:24:43,670
Oh, yeah, it's ten. Something. Something, something.

759
01:24:43,940 --> 01:24:46,979
We have something. 135 something 50. Okay.

760
01:24:46,980 --> 01:24:51,620
Partial credit because it is from 41 to 135, which is 30 dangerous.

761
01:24:52,140 --> 01:24:55,620
Extreme is 70 to 1 25,000 points then.

762
01:24:56,250 --> 01:25:00,660
All right, Jillian, can I do prevention for 300?

763
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:12,960
Prevention for 300? The question is, what is it okay to use bare hands when you're putting in the food that will be cooked to the temperatures?

764
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:18,959
Yeah. Perfect. All right. Yeah. Yeah. Like when? I mean, pizza toppings or anything that's going to be cooked, like.

765
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:22,140
All right, great. Hand-washing in 200.

766
01:25:22,290 --> 01:25:29,070
Hand-washing for 200. The question is, what sink do you wash your hands designated, I think for hand-washing.

767
01:25:29,100 --> 01:25:32,960
Exactly. That's your handwriting thing. Perfect. All right.

768
01:25:33,030 --> 01:25:36,329
Well, and that's you. Hand-washing. 100 hand-washing here.

769
01:25:36,330 --> 01:25:40,770
100. And the question is, how many seconds do you need to scrub your hands and arms?

770
01:25:40,980 --> 01:25:44,070
15. Let's see what the answer is. Ten.

771
01:25:44,070 --> 01:25:48,770
13. So, pretty much, yeah, very close. Very close. Do we have time for one more?

772
01:25:49,170 --> 01:25:54,719
Okay. What I like about it is that we all went out of the LG OC 400.

773
01:25:54,720 --> 01:26:01,120
Prevention. All right. Prevention for 400. The question is, is hand sanitizer good enough to use for dinner?

774
01:26:01,140 --> 01:26:04,170
I don't know exactly. It does not replace washing your hands.

775
01:26:04,470 --> 01:26:09,240
Question is, how could you use that? I mean, no, definitely not.

776
01:26:09,720 --> 01:26:15,660
You got to know how to shower before work hard on hand-washing first 300.

777
01:26:15,660 --> 01:26:24,240
The question is, why should you wash your hands? Definitely after you use the bathroom when touching your face or touching your apron after eating.

778
01:26:24,360 --> 01:26:29,570
But I really like great prevention, 100 prevention for 100.

779
01:26:29,580 --> 01:26:34,440
And the question is, when should you change your gloves, for example, after you touch raw meat?

780
01:26:35,070 --> 01:26:38,830
Yes, that is. Yeah. What does your food, anything dirty, basically.

781
01:26:38,830 --> 01:26:43,620
Do you want to wash your hands? Prevention to prevention for 200.

782
01:26:43,620 --> 01:26:46,800
When should you take off your apron before going to the bathroom?

783
01:26:47,130 --> 01:26:51,190
All right, let's see what it is yet. Before I went to the bathroom. Correct.

784
01:26:51,770 --> 01:26:54,810
I don't actually know who won, but let's just say Grace is letting her.

785
01:26:57,690 --> 01:27:03,030
So yeah, I thought that was really good.

786
01:27:04,540 --> 01:27:12,650
It wasn't. It was very high energy wasn't something that you mentioned, the hand sanitizer one.

787
01:27:12,660 --> 01:27:14,729
That is a question that could be on the exam.

788
01:27:14,730 --> 01:27:22,770
So can't sanitizer is not a substitute for hand-washing because it's not like mechanically removing all the nasties and dirt.

789
01:27:22,770 --> 01:27:28,200
Right. So you can hand sanitizer if you want, but you also need to wash your hands, too.

790
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:51,510
So I'm glad you brought that up. So awesome job. It was good. Okay, there's no one, but there were some music, so I love music.

791
01:27:52,230 --> 01:27:57,299
We've got you. Okay, let me. Let me start.

792
01:27:57,300 --> 01:28:01,100
Really? Well, first that.

793
01:28:08,290 --> 01:28:13,140
Let's see. Is this one of people?

794
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:21,560
Wake up the building, I think.

795
01:28:21,880 --> 01:28:33,190
Okay. Great scene today to say that it should be.

796
01:28:33,430 --> 01:28:39,009
And what it does is. Yeah. Oh, do you see?

797
01:28:39,010 --> 01:28:42,190
This is for the time to get to Pakistan for Thanksgiving.

798
01:28:42,550 --> 01:28:49,000
And the danger zone is, ah, bacteria growing more rapidly and that between 41 degrees Fahrenheit, 135 degrees Fahrenheit.

799
01:28:49,590 --> 01:29:02,050
Also thinking from right here, I think Temple has there there was supposed to be those ashes and I couldn't

800
01:29:02,290 --> 01:29:14,029
think of the items or menu of the day are these three are that he alone that had

801
01:29:14,030 --> 01:29:20,889
stories yesterday that we had collected I mean like you need a milk in a half hour

802
01:29:20,890 --> 01:29:30,230
yogurt party in a guy like mine and also now of the days of the day and it's

803
01:29:30,760 --> 01:29:38,120
who yeah so her day to day don't bother that comes with the bagel and cream cheese

804
01:29:39,020 --> 01:29:45,940
and let us just later so I have wanted to know everything about a bagel so

805
01:29:45,940 --> 01:29:57,890
comprehensive some of the I have love to wrap up another AP said it would have

806
01:29:59,130 --> 01:30:06,820
impact and the team member both bagel power and include will be give us a counter.

807
01:30:11,180 --> 01:30:17,110
I don't think it's quite the incentive I like.

808
01:30:18,610 --> 01:30:24,580
All right. Good job. I like how you brought in the the menu items, like the example.

809
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:28,660
That's really good. Thank you. All right, Brian.

810
01:30:28,760 --> 01:30:34,900
Well, that one again, you know, 25.

811
01:30:36,460 --> 01:30:40,360
Just wait. Where are we going? Right here.

812
01:30:40,510 --> 01:30:57,610
Go wherever you want. Okay. I mean, I think you can only do 18.

813
01:30:57,640 --> 01:31:03,760
Welcome back to our fried chicken joint. Like, say that even longer today.

814
01:31:04,540 --> 01:31:09,790
So we're going to do a couple in-service topics about hand-washing and personal hygiene.

815
01:31:09,790 --> 01:31:13,690
So let's see what you guys know. So great. You're coming to meet us today for a special salad.

816
01:31:14,110 --> 01:31:16,660
Do you think you need to wash your hand before starting your pregnancy?

817
01:31:17,230 --> 01:31:21,820
Uh, yeah, because I'm usually wash produce that will not be cooked after I get it.

818
01:31:22,420 --> 01:31:26,800
But wait, Corinne, you know all the steps to proper hand-washing, just hot water and soap, right?

819
01:31:27,340 --> 01:31:35,200
Yeah, actually, there's more to it than that, because when your hands and then you're with and your arms with warm water.

820
01:31:35,560 --> 01:31:40,720
Yeah. You're going to add. So making a lather around your hands and don't forget to rinse under your nails.

821
01:31:41,050 --> 01:31:49,180
Yeah, absolutely. But don't forget your arms to make sure you use grab your hands and arms for ten and 15 seconds.

822
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:56,130
In fact, I don't. I like to sing Happy Birthday to times though, through veterans.

823
01:31:56,160 --> 01:32:02,340
Put your hands and arms thoroughly. Yeah. And finally, dry your hands and arms with paper towels.

824
01:32:02,490 --> 01:32:07,290
Great job, team. I heard that you're washing your hands after the bathroom to also use a paper

825
01:32:07,290 --> 01:32:10,590
towel to turn off the basin and open any doors after you wash your hands.

826
01:32:11,820 --> 01:32:14,760
What if I need to go to the bathroom in the middle of my shift?

827
01:32:15,270 --> 01:32:19,630
Well, if you're wearing an apron, make sure you take that off along with your gloves and hair.

828
01:32:20,700 --> 01:32:26,670
Yeah. Alison, I think I can help Karen prepare chicken today.

829
01:32:26,970 --> 01:32:30,720
Can I also help with tomato after? Of course.

830
01:32:30,720 --> 01:32:37,590
We're all here to work as a team, and I'll be Karen. But since you're handling raw poultry, you must wash your hands for helping with the tomatoes.

831
01:32:37,830 --> 01:32:45,660
Oh, right. I know it's very important to wash your hands after touching raw meat and then touching produce that's not cooked.

832
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:52,290
Why do we care about that? Yeah, well, you mentioned fresh pathogens, and that causes foodborne illnesses.

833
01:32:52,890 --> 01:32:56,580
No, no, no. I don't do that one at home.

834
01:32:57,270 --> 01:33:05,700
Yeah, we don't. We have to follow state and federal guidelines at work to ensure future of the safety for our customers.

835
01:33:05,940 --> 01:33:11,310
If we had a full borne outbreak, we might be out of our jobs and we might be homeless.

836
01:33:13,770 --> 01:33:19,830
Hey, Alison, where can I find the information so I don't forget? We actually have a pamphlet over here that describes everything.

837
01:33:19,980 --> 01:33:25,230
And you'll be sure. And I'll be sure to hand or to put out brief infographics from the kitchen and the

838
01:33:25,230 --> 01:33:33,960
bathroom so we can all remember production lines which are been taking off your hair.

839
01:33:34,190 --> 01:33:37,320
That's very thorough, but you don't technically have to.

840
01:33:38,040 --> 01:33:44,820
But I'm glad you were detailed about it. And if you take off your hand, your gloves, you need to obviously put new gloves on.

841
01:33:44,850 --> 01:33:48,360
Right. You got to throw them away, but. Good. Nice job. There's something else I wanted to comment.

842
01:33:48,690 --> 01:33:52,080
I forgot. Oh, but I like it.

843
01:33:52,260 --> 01:33:56,320
Good work. Okay, we need three and four, right?

844
01:33:59,550 --> 01:34:06,020
Three and. One is a distance.

845
01:34:08,970 --> 01:34:13,130
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

846
01:34:25,050 --> 01:34:37,500
Or you look at the length of the victims for what happened to them.

847
01:34:38,280 --> 01:34:46,079
Oh yeah, I do that first. Yeah, we'll have a poll everywhere.

848
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:54,660
I'm like 30 seconds, so. Yeah, we're just getting awaken here.

849
01:34:55,260 --> 01:35:01,830
Oh, okay. So don't worry about it. I'm very excited about it.

850
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:09,209
So I was like, Oh, I don't know.

851
01:35:09,210 --> 01:35:37,530
I'm not even sure that we should have this because this is going to be I think it's it's going to like.

852
01:35:37,740 --> 01:35:51,240
Did you share them? Yeah. Because they don't know anything about it.

853
01:35:51,240 --> 01:36:27,220
So I was like HDMI over here, and I'm sure that light is so great, they can switch the lights up here.

854
01:36:30,220 --> 01:36:36,750
Yeah. Yeah, good. Okay. All right.

855
01:36:36,870 --> 01:36:45,540
So we did us a little bit differently. You're all our staff, so we're gonna be doing a poll everywhere, going over some chemical safety.

856
01:36:45,960 --> 01:36:51,950
So make sure you feel that something. Get ready to respond. So first of all, there is a word cloud.

857
01:36:52,160 --> 01:36:55,880
What comes to mind when you hear the phrase chemical safety in food service?

858
01:37:01,370 --> 01:37:18,870
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

859
01:37:22,150 --> 01:37:31,610
Well, you know, he's got it.

860
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:40,870
All right, I'll give it about 30 more seconds. The danger that makes it so.

861
01:37:46,210 --> 01:37:51,730
Okay, awesome. So these are all really good words and really important concepts when you're thinking about chemical safety.

862
01:37:52,180 --> 01:37:57,009
Today, we're going to really focus on the storage of chemicals and how to make sure

863
01:37:57,010 --> 01:38:00,070
that our chemicals don't get in our food through the way we're storing them.

864
01:38:01,020 --> 01:38:06,780
So our next question is where is the best place to store chemicals?

865
01:38:08,660 --> 01:38:13,360
Exactly. So somebody it.

866
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:17,540
That's my problem. You know, it was like I said, they activated the whole thing.

867
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:28,990
Like, you know, this is just the one, you know?

868
01:38:33,650 --> 01:38:37,040
I mean, I think that everybody's got it right.

869
01:38:37,790 --> 01:38:43,970
Well, that is the correct answer. In the storage areas that. Yeah.

870
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:55,490
It's just not going to happen.

871
01:38:55,790 --> 01:39:00,230
All right. Here's our next question. Oh, you wanted to go out to this one, huh?

872
01:39:00,590 --> 01:39:04,400
Where can you find safety information about specific chemicals?

873
01:39:05,470 --> 01:39:13,490
You can select multiple answers for these reasons.

874
01:39:23,670 --> 01:39:30,830
So yes, definitely manufacturers, labels. And from OSHA, you want to make sure you're getting the most up to date information.

875
01:39:31,790 --> 01:39:37,040
I wouldn't necessarily trust Wikipedia because anyone can edit that information.

876
01:39:37,710 --> 01:39:42,410
So the third one or the first for both?

877
01:39:42,410 --> 01:39:47,690
The first and the third are correct. Oh, really? Two, you should have been.

878
01:39:48,070 --> 01:39:52,900
No. Okay. Okay.

879
01:39:53,750 --> 01:40:07,810
All right. And our final question for you. Yeah.

880
01:40:07,900 --> 01:40:12,410
You guys definitely got it. So that Ajax is stored close to the mustard and the soda.

881
01:40:12,980 --> 01:40:17,240
So ideally, we want our chemicals stored in a separate room.

882
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:24,330
Definitely not next to food. We want to label all of our all of our chemicals correctly.

883
01:40:25,460 --> 01:40:28,700
We don't want to clean any surfaces while there's food out.

884
01:40:30,860 --> 01:40:35,270
We want to follow the manufacturer's instructions when we're using chemicals and

885
01:40:36,470 --> 01:40:39,500
definitely washing your hands in between using chemicals and touching food.

886
01:40:42,190 --> 01:40:56,330
Good job. You know, I was like, you know where my pride.

887
01:40:57,040 --> 01:41:01,300
Yeah, of course. I want to come up here.

888
01:41:02,710 --> 01:41:06,850
I want to go. I realize that they're like.

889
01:41:06,850 --> 01:41:16,280
I don't know how much money he makes for being able to raise food safety.

890
01:41:16,420 --> 01:41:20,460
As you remember yesterday, a staple style in the hash browns.

891
01:41:20,470 --> 01:41:27,700
It was to be served to a child. But so to my aunt, she figured it out before it was a big issue.

892
01:41:27,700 --> 01:41:34,059
Mad. Tell us what you did. Oh, sure. I noticed that there was a box mistakenly near the food, which is not good.

893
01:41:34,060 --> 01:41:39,520
So I look and then I throw the bad stuff around and I go to the fryer, which is super fun.

894
01:41:39,940 --> 01:41:45,100
Right. Thank you very much. Because that saved the day.

895
01:41:45,310 --> 01:41:49,209
So today we're going to go over food safety with a game of jeopardy.

896
01:41:49,210 --> 01:41:52,990
As you can see, it's very clearly up on the board.

897
01:41:54,130 --> 01:41:59,709
All right. So we have four categories, types of physical contaminants, waste physical containers,

898
01:41:59,710 --> 01:42:04,510
get into food populations at risk and how to prevent the table contaminants.

899
01:42:04,870 --> 01:42:16,360
I would like to start out types of physical contaminants for a 100 types of physical contaminants for 100.

900
01:42:16,390 --> 01:42:20,440
Yes, this type comes from humans.

901
01:42:21,190 --> 01:42:24,510
What? Our fingernails would do this.

902
01:42:24,730 --> 01:42:33,010
All right, uh, next. Listen, um, I'll do what is physical contaminant food?

903
01:42:33,820 --> 01:42:42,750
Okay. All right. So fingernails fake a real get into food, which happened because somebody wasn't wearing gloves.

904
01:42:43,120 --> 01:42:47,950
Oh, that would be a reason why. Correct? Important.

905
01:42:50,050 --> 01:42:56,470
Yes. My next question, how to prevent physical contaminants, which are 100.

906
01:42:56,800 --> 01:43:04,720
Excellent question. Okay. What should be used when getting ice out of the machine and as soon as.

907
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:11,410
Right. Because otherwise it has to go through a very similar process, which is, as you know, not the most fun.

908
01:43:11,800 --> 01:43:26,470
All right. Let's take three more questions. I'll hear types for 300 times or 300 do see roller this is naturally occurring petroleum what

909
01:43:26,470 --> 01:43:33,940
are possible that is right excellent job or really doing well guys Alex and one more for you.

910
01:43:33,940 --> 01:43:45,460
How do populations and populations at risk for 200 odd some that's important this population may be more likely to choke on larger contaminants.

911
01:43:46,720 --> 01:43:49,960
That's correct. All right. We got one more.

912
01:43:51,190 --> 01:43:54,670
Texas is looking for 205, which is right.

913
01:43:56,140 --> 01:44:02,980
Okay. Well, that's an excellent choice. Last question. This comes from containers or packaging labels.

914
01:44:03,370 --> 01:44:05,439
They it various, as you know. All right.

915
01:44:05,440 --> 01:44:17,080
Well, since we all got all the questions right, we get a guys and we will give you our double employee discount for the day.

916
01:44:17,410 --> 01:44:25,240
Yeah. So, guys.

917
01:44:26,320 --> 01:44:31,660
All right. So hopefully you can see it does not take long to make something that's engaging for staff.

918
01:44:31,660 --> 01:44:38,560
Right. With a little goofy that's okay. Remember better and it's something that you can use when you're actually in the field.

919
01:44:38,800 --> 01:44:47,500
So thank you. They're very entertaining. I appreciate it. Real quick, I know we got 2 minutes left if you're interested.

920
01:44:47,770 --> 01:44:52,060
These are some additional resources about food service and food safety.

921
01:44:52,210 --> 01:44:57,730
When COVID first happened in 2020, obviously we've all been a part of these changes now.

922
01:44:57,730 --> 01:45:02,040
So they might not be as is earth shattering, but it's really interesting to see what happened.

923
01:45:02,320 --> 01:45:12,670
So this is a good article from University of Washington that talks about the changes that happened to their hospital food service operation.

924
01:45:12,940 --> 01:45:18,549
And then there's two good videos, one from here and one from U of M that talked about housing and dining protocol.

925
01:45:18,550 --> 01:45:21,910
Changing that starts around 55 seconds.

926
01:45:21,910 --> 01:45:26,200
They talk about residential halls, too, so you can skip ahead that.

927
01:45:26,380 --> 01:45:28,830
And then there's another one from the University of Illinois. That's good.

928
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:34,450
That talked about what items they implemented to promote public safety for the pandemic.

929
01:45:35,680 --> 01:45:40,660
And then next week, so same time, same place will be going over part two.

930
01:45:41,730 --> 01:45:45,780
Have a few more modules in this week. So four, five, six, seven, they're a little bit shorter.

931
01:45:46,020 --> 01:45:50,100
I think so. Shouldn't be too bad. Assignment two opens at 10 a.m.

932
01:45:50,910 --> 01:45:54,440
I didn't look up. How many questions are on the surface of exam? That's 98.

933
01:45:54,600 --> 01:45:57,600
So 90 questions was right. 2 hours.

934
01:45:58,500 --> 01:46:01,350
Yes, 2 hours. Yeah. Oh, we know.

935
01:46:01,440 --> 01:46:07,830
So you got to know your stuff to be able to answer it pretty quickly, but you will be plenty prepared at the end of this month.

936
01:46:09,530 --> 01:46:15,600
But then, any questions between now and then? Let me know. Virtual office hours on Mondays at four.

937
01:46:15,780 --> 01:46:20,160
So you're always welcome to stop in us that link out again on Monday when I send an update.

938
01:46:20,370 --> 01:46:23,520
So. All right. Anything else before we head off?

939
01:46:24,510 --> 01:46:31,800
No. All right. Thanks, everyone, for that.

940
01:46:35,050 --> 01:46:39,000
Know I never better her.
