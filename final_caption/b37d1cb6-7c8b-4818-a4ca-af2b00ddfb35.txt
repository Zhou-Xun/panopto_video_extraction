1
00:01:54,970 --> 00:02:22,970
All right. Who's up for the news article today? Because as hard as I am, I am ready for a fall break next week.

2
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,260
So let's have it done. Okay, so here's what.

3
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:39,509
Sooner than later in this article and the first randomized controlled trial of colon cancer that was done in northern Europe with men and women,

4
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:43,410
over 84,000 men and women ages 55 to 64.

5
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:50,399
That kind of target audience took. And like I said, it was the first randomized trial that has been done of it.

6
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,010
So it was a big deal and they were expecting some pretty big results.

7
00:02:53,310 --> 00:03:03,930
And what they did in the finding was that neither that was effective for reducing the risk of or reducing the risk of death for colon cancer,

8
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:11,609
which was pretty surprising. And we'll go into how a lot of doctors and scientists ended up saying trust

9
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:14,940
the science but don't trust the science because there's a lot to look into.

10
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:19,920
We're going to talk a little bit about publication bias and some other things that may have played into this.

11
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:25,650
Yeah. So overall, the group who received the colonoscopy only had small benefits to receiving it.

12
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:34,049
It was reported that 18% had a lower risk of getting cancer and no significant reduction in the risk of cancer death,

13
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:42,840
which was super surprising to the researchers. And only 42% of the participants who were invited to get a colonoscopy in the study actually got one.

14
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:47,940
So it was about 12,000 out of the 28,000 participants that were recruited,

15
00:03:48,390 --> 00:04:00,300
and it reduced the risk of colorectal cancer by 31% and the risk of dying by 50% of those people who actually got the colonoscopy.

16
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:07,890
So this was a little confusing to us because when they only analyzed the data of the participants who got the screening,

17
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:11,400
it was proven to be effective for its intended purpose.

18
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:15,290
And a lot of gastroenterologists were disappointed with the results.

19
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:20,040
However, they encouraged people to embrace the science and the outcome of the study.

20
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:26,879
So the main takeaways and the reason that this study matters is because colon colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer in the U.S. However,

21
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:32,280
only one in five adults between the ages of 50 and 75 have ever been screened for colorectal cancer.

22
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:39,150
So overall, the study found that just inviting people to get a colonoscopy didn't have a large beneficial impact across these countries.

23
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:45,360
But that was mostly attributed to the fact that a lot of people didn't go through with the with the screening so many

24
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:51,960
times the results of the study disappointing because some of the statistics were deemed statistically insignificant.

25
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:58,740
However, the main takeaway is still that more people need to receive screening because had a lot of people got through with the colorectal screening,

26
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:03,780
the results probably would have been different. We found that this fed into the topic of publication bias.

27
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:06,960
Obviously the study was published, but it was also highly anticipated.

28
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:14,250
If, while the study did yield results that were typically insignificant and this was disappointing to a lot of people,

29
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:19,380
the fact is it pointed to the fact that more people actually need to get screened.

30
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,620
Great. So do you guys all understand? So let's let's make sure we all understand.

31
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:30,900
So they read. How many people do they read? Like how many total people were in the study?

32
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:36,390
How many? 84. And presumably, like half and half to screening in that screening.

33
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:41,710
First. It's in the bag of dirty towels, isn't it?

34
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:54,510
Okay. All right. So you had a screening of 42,000 and not screening 42,000, right?

35
00:05:55,040 --> 00:06:01,570
Mm hmm. Okay. So what actually happened is that among so if you do an intention to treat analysis,

36
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:10,810
if you compare colorectal cancer mortality in these people who were randomized to screening and then the people who weren't randomized to screening,

37
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:15,940
you only see like an 18% benefit, 18% reduction.

38
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:25,150
The trouble is we have another possible kind of problem, right where we have contamination because of these 42,000.

39
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:37,500
How many actually got screening? Only 12,000 are getting so less than half like less than a third of the people

40
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,800
who were randomized to be invited for screening actually have to live with it.

41
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:52,020
If you do a an analysis where you only compare the people who actually got the treatment, got the screening, then you get a 50%.

42
00:06:53,770 --> 00:07:02,330
Production. But it's not statistically significant because they were powered to have 42,000 people ready

43
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:07,820
and suddenly their sample sizes per like the people treated as cut in to less than a third.

44
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:13,249
So it's not statistically significant. And what have you also remember we went through these study designs.

45
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:17,990
What have you also reintroduced by doing the analysis this way?

46
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:22,070
Now you have people who chose to be screened.

47
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,590
So what potential source of bias are you reintroducing?

48
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:39,840
It normally is taken care of when you randomize which could be selection bias not to be confounding right.

49
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,750
Because these are people who chose to come to a screening.

50
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:48,340
So maybe they're more health conscious or or maybe they're more they have a relative who died of colon cancer.

51
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:52,259
They're more concerned. Right. So now you've got all of this these problems again,

52
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:58,020
where you've got people who are choosing to be screened as opposed to people who are randomized to be screened.

53
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:04,719
Okay. So this was a lot of money and time spent to end up with an equivocal answer that we

54
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,950
actually still don't have a good trial results looking at colorectal cancer screening.

55
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,900
The other thing I'm curious is, do you know how long they followed these people for?

56
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:21,950
I believe it was ten letters. Okay. You might see more benefit if you followed people for a longer.

57
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:30,189
Right. Because it takes a long time to develop colorectal cancer.

58
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:34,389
So you might actually see more difference between the two groups if they were followed for a longer time.

59
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,100
But that's more money and more expensive,

60
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,210
and they probably threw in the towel when they realized that nobody was actually coming to get their screening.

61
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:49,899
So the the the take away the public health take away from all of this is that probably colon colorectal can't colon ask is work really well?

62
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:54,340
Probably. Right. It makes sense that they would we can see the precancerous lesion.

63
00:08:54,340 --> 00:09:00,309
You can take it out before it gets to be cancer. You can access or it like it seems like it probably works.

64
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:06,670
Right. We don't have firm scientific evidence of that because people don't like to get caught.

65
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:09,790
I. I mean, I know that's shocking.

66
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:13,420
Like not eating for 24 hours have had a liquid diet,

67
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:21,070
taking this horrible stuff that makes you clean your entire colon and which it's not it's not supposed to be clean.

68
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:23,080
It's not that's unnatural. It's very bad.

69
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:30,999
But cleaning it all out and then, you know, going in for this procedure where they stick something up your butt, nobody likes it.

70
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,399
It's kind of gross. It's uncomfortable, right. But, you know, it's hard to get beat.

71
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,879
It's a hard is a tough sell, but it really is one of the ones that works.

72
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:46,870
So I think I'm going to go ahead say I think it works even though the trial didn't really work out.

73
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:54,130
But what kind of when you do your intention to treat analysis right and you include everybody who was randomized to screening,

74
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:59,430
but only 12,000 of them got it. Then what kind of bias do you have when you're comparing your screening group?

75
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:04,670
Non screening group? This area.

76
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:11,660
It's information bias. Yes, it's misclassification, you're right.

77
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:14,870
And it's probably not differential with respect to the outcome.

78
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:21,290
But what does that do? It biases your results toward the null, right?

79
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:26,689
So you suddenly don't see as much reduction as maybe you really should and you've got huge amounts.

80
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:35,390
I mean, it's not even a tiny bit. This is a huge amount of misclassification as more than more than two thirds of your sample is in the wrong group.

81
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:43,980
So. Anyway. So that was a bust for the people who did this trial.

82
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:50,220
Thank you, though. That was really interesting. And we'll get into more of this when we talk about our screening lecture.

83
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:56,210
There are parts of us now and both. Okay.

84
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:03,580
So it turns out it's hard to do studies in people. They don't always cooperate.

85
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:08,590
You tell them to do a thing and then another thing, and then they mess up your whole analysis.

86
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:18,550
All right. So we got review today.

87
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:24,760
We've got exam on Thursday, and then we have Fulbright.

88
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:32,910
Anybody doing big plans? Traveling. Staying in bed and watching movies.

89
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:37,320
Yeah. There we go. That's my kind of fall break. I don't know.

90
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:42,460
Traveling always feels like it's more work. Like I enjoy it, but you're tired or when you get back.

91
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,480
Right. And so for, like, a two day break, it's, you know, it's just. It's.

92
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:52,000
TV show marathon time. Okay. All right.

93
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,929
So I am I have like I said, I have no agenda here.

94
00:11:55,930 --> 00:12:00,969
I thought you were just usually what I do is I just kind of start with each lecture and people who have questions about that lecture,

95
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:04,330
raise your hand and I will answer them. Okay.

96
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:07,630
So let's start with us, cancer epidemiologist.

97
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:16,060
I said I want you. Yes. For the purposes to contribute to cancer mortality.

98
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:23,290
Yeah. Can we talk about the chat? I got information about this generally, but can you talk about some of the differences?

99
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:30,460
Yeah. So what that means is like if I ask you, what are the top three causes of cancer in men in the U.S. in order?

100
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:37,520
Prostate lung. That's right. How about the top three causes of death in order?

101
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:43,830
Mm hmm. Yup. Yup.

102
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:47,459
And can you do that for women, too? It's the same.

103
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:50,970
You just replace breast. Right. It's breast, lung, colon. Long breast.

104
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:54,420
Colon. Right. That's the answer to that one.

105
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,930
But what did you want to what was your question specifically? No, I wasn't.

106
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:01,440
I was talking to the top contributors.

107
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:04,500
Oh, my goodness. I like incidence early detection.

108
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,430
Like genetic. I think you were asking about like what? No, not causes.

109
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:16,050
Not causes. No, I'm talking about, like the top cancers that cause death, like the top mortality cancers.

110
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:20,390
When you say the top cancers, that means incidence of top contributors to cancer death.

111
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:24,000
It's like the order of the ones that caused that mortality. Does that make sense?

112
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:31,080
Yeah. Okay. Yes. Absolutely.

113
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:35,940
When we get to that lecture, I will do that. So let's let's keep going with this one, see if people have other questions about this lecture.

114
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:39,130
But I knew that one was going to happen. Yes. Oh.

115
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:45,030
She's kind of cool. I like that. Absolutely.

116
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:52,230
Okay. You know what? I'm going to pull up a couple of slides now that might just confuse things.

117
00:13:52,410 --> 00:14:02,070
Okay. So let's think about like, let's think about if you wanted to compare cancer mortality in two countries, the US and like.

118
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:09,120
Panama City. Okay. Which country has an older age distribution?

119
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:22,999
Older people, probably the US low and middle income countries have a younger population generally just because of the aging of the population.

120
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,310
That happens as the country goes through the ideological transition.

121
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:27,510
All right.

122
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:33,180
So if you were just to look at crude without doing anything, which countries do you think would have more cancer mortality, the U.S. or Panama?

123
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:42,270
Yes, because they've got old people. Right. So that said, it doesn't really make sense to just compare them about who's going to have age.

124
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:48,420
Like you're interested in knowing, kind of like aside from the fact that we know we have an older population who's got more cancer mortality.

125
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:53,070
Right? So the way we do that is we do age adjustment.

126
00:14:54,300 --> 00:15:02,010
So we adjusted what the question you're asking with age adjustment is essentially if each population have the same age structure,

127
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,500
what would their mortality rate?

128
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:11,920
And that's why you adjust, so that you can compare apples to apples sort of taking age out of the equation, like, okay, we know age.

129
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:18,510
That's not that's not what we're interested in. Age aside, can we compare the cancer mortality in these two countries?

130
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:22,860
Okay. If they had the same age structure, would they have the same cancer mortality?

131
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:34,420
Justin. The way you actually do it is that you take the age, so you have population one.

132
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:40,210
This is for people who think in math. If this is going to confuse you, ignore it.

133
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:44,500
If math helps you, pay attention to this. If math confuses you, don't worry.

134
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:56,480
So you would take like. And these would actually be an age like 0 to 5, 5 to 10 year olds, 10 to 20 year olds, 20 to 30.

135
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:01,130
You know what I mean? Like you would break this down into age groups like. But I'm just saying, young, middle and old, just sick.

136
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:10,540
And you would get the pop, the age, the rate of cancer death in each of these populations, in each of these age strata in your population.

137
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:13,990
So say we're talking about Panama. Right.

138
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:20,320
So maybe five per 1000 and maybe six per 1000 and it might be ten per 1000.

139
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:25,540
And then you might do the US, you do the same, you have young middle at all and you'd say, okay,

140
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:30,489
what is our age, standardized rate or not, excuse me, not our age specific rate for each of these groups.

141
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:40,180
What is the crude rate in each of these age groups? And it might be like three per 1000, five per 1000, nine per 1000.

142
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:44,350
And then you would say, okay, let's get some sort of standard.

143
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:51,310
So let's say we have a standard population with like 100,000 people in each of these age groups.

144
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:57,730
I would take this age specific rate and multiply it by 100,000 people to get an expected number of deaths.

145
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:02,320
If this age specific rate were applied to this size population.

146
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:06,760
Right. And then you would get, what, 5000? You'd get how many?

147
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,760
500 or 5000 times?

148
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:14,400
100,000. 500. Yes. It's very, quote, zeros.

149
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:19,130
And then you get 600 expected deaths here and a thousand expected deaths here.

150
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:22,900
You bed up, you'd get 1120, 100.

151
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:27,130
Right. And you would say, okay, 20, 100 per 300,000.

152
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:30,250
That's my age. Standardized rate for the for Panama.

153
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:35,680
You would do the same thing here. You play each of these each of these rates to the standard.

154
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,069
Do you see what I'm saying? And get the expected number of deaths.

155
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:43,570
If these age standardized rates were applied to this population and then you would add them up divided by

156
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:48,970
300,000 and you would get your age standardized rate for the U.S. then you can compare them to each other.

157
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:53,890
Does that make sense? It's more complicated. You get smaller age groups.

158
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:58,900
There are certain standards that people I just made this up, but there are standards that people use.

159
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:03,640
Like in the US, we commonly use the U.S. 2000 population from the census as a standard.

160
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:10,450
That way, when people age standardized, everything is that it all has to be standardized to the same standard in order to compare it to each other.

161
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:14,890
So having a standard that everybody uses is important because then you can just compare everything.

162
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:19,360
That's the whole purpose of age adjustment, right? If everyone's using a different standard, you still can't compare them.

163
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:23,020
So everybody in the U.S. generally uses the 2000 population.

164
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:33,240
There is a couple of different world standards that people use to compare world rates to each other that are kind of accepted and that makes sense.

165
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:38,000
Yeah, that help. Yes. Does that help the math people? Okay.

166
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:47,070
And in a in a like an intro to epidemiology class in a master's program, you would learn to do this by here.

167
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:53,150
That would be on the test, not on the test or. All right.

168
00:18:55,380 --> 00:19:04,830
Many other questions about the US Cancer Lecture. How about global cancer?

169
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:18,990
How about cancer biology and genetics? Yes.

170
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,660
We look at the difference between. The hallmarks of cancer.

171
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:27,860
And. Yes, so the hallmarks of cancer are.

172
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:38,330
Where are you? You are. Where are you?

173
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:42,709
Hallmarks of cancer picture. Remember this?

174
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:47,360
This Carnahan and Weinberg article that was published in 2007.

175
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:54,440
These are the hallmarks, right? So. Make it bigger.

176
00:19:55,730 --> 00:20:02,090
So sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, activating invasion of metastasis,

177
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:08,090
enabling the replicative more to immortality, inducing angiogenesis and resisting cell death.

178
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:16,220
These are the hallmarks. Okay. And so I might ask you what some of the hallmarks of cancer are.

179
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:19,850
They might be, you know, self-sufficiency and growth signals.

180
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:23,089
So this is just the same thing. This is the picture from the paper.

181
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:32,660
This is the same thing in list form. So self-sufficiency and growth signals means like when I talked about castrate resistant prostate cancer.

182
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:37,069
Like, if you if you cut down the body's supply of testosterone, it stops the cancer from growing.

183
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:40,130
But eventually it will make its own to keep it growing.

184
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:46,630
Right. Cancers will do that. Right. They will evolve their ability to make their own growth signals so that you don't

185
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:51,340
have to have it coming kind of systemically insensitive to the anti-growth signals.

186
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:54,589
So even if if the message is coming in, oh, we should stop growing.

187
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:59,540
It's like we're going to go ahead and keep doing that. Evasion of apoptosis.

188
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:04,970
So that's another way of restraining growth, right? To move it to programed cell death at some point.

189
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:11,360
Cancer cells are like, I'm not going to do that. You can tell me you're not going to have unrestricted replication.

190
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:15,010
So that means they just keep growing. A lot of this is kind of the same, right?

191
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:18,290
So these things will lead to unrestricted replication.

192
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:24,260
Right. Sustained angiogenesis. Remember we talked about that is the creation of new blood vessels to feed the tumor.

193
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:29,900
Once it gets large enough, it needs a bigger blood supply and then invasion and metastasis.

194
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:34,520
So those are the hallmarks of cancer cancers, kind of the biological things that cancer does.

195
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,810
Okay. What was the other thing you want to know about?

196
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:43,490
Oh, yes. The multi-stage model is this idea.

197
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:52,899
No, no, no. That cancer involves multiple mutations and genetic or epigenetic events.

198
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:56,350
That's right. That you need these 3 to 7 hits to get to cancer.

199
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:59,770
It's not just one mutation.

200
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:04,390
It's a bunch of them. And it has to be in both the tumor suppressor and the oncogene.

201
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:08,410
At the same time, the brakes have to be off and the accelerator has to be down the same time.

202
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:15,250
Right. And the DNA repair genes kind of contribute to all of that because they let these these.

203
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:23,060
Things in the in the oncogene zone, the tumor suppressor genes have. That makes sense that I've seen over here.

204
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:28,910
Yes. Yeah. Relatively.

205
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:42,930
Yeah. So generally it's so hard.

206
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,940
Okay. So for this particular question,

207
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:54,990
the reason that male HPV related cases are higher in the U.S. is because in the U.S. we have a lot of each HPV related or differential cancer in men,

208
00:22:55,350 --> 00:23:02,879
and that's more prominent men. Not entirely understood why it is thought that the acquisition of oral HPV infection

209
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:07,470
is easier when performing oral sex on a woman than with performing oral sex on a man.

210
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:12,660
Possibly because people don't use deviled eggs as much as they use condoms for oral sex.

211
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:18,120
Unclear, right. But that is that is kind of outside classes that people have.

212
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:24,930
And then on average, men are performing oral sex more on women, nothing more on their right and vice versa.

213
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:30,459
So that is the thought. But if you actually look at like the rates,

214
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:38,530
the rate of of HPV related oropharyngeal cancer is relatively low in the US compared to the rate of cervical cancer in low and middle income country.

215
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:43,929
Right. So the bigger public health problem and the place where HPV associated cancers

216
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:48,160
are still a bigger problem is in developing countries than it is for women.

217
00:23:49,420 --> 00:24:01,530
Does that make sense? Male HPV related cancers are largely related to, I would say, cultural differences in kind of sexual practices, right?

218
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:05,610
In some places where oral sex is more common and more accepted,

219
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:11,770
you're going to have more HPV related oral cancer and then, you know, that kind of thing.

220
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:21,450
Yes. No, I don't think so.

221
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:26,519
So I would say so. Here's the thing. You guys always I think it's because I'm not telling you guys if you guys always do this,

222
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:31,440
but I think because your generation has grown up with the HPV vaccine,

223
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:37,590
you kind of view it as the first line of primary prevention against cervical cancer.

224
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:46,259
And it may be true for your generation, but the women and the men who are getting oral HPV related cancer right now,

225
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:51,600
who are getting these cancers and what we've kind of seen up to this point, we're not old.

226
00:24:51,600 --> 00:25:01,920
We're not young enough to be vaccinated. Right. So think about it was the year 2009, I think, when we really first started vaccinating.

227
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:07,440
So if you were 20, you were like at the high end, so you were 25 in 2009.

228
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:13,880
How old would you be now? Help me. Thank you.

229
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:18,200
My math is not working this morning. I'm like somebody else to do this. I can't.

230
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:23,120
38 So that's still fairly young for getting these cancers right.

231
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:30,830
So the people who are getting the cancers now did not really have the benefit of having the potentially protected by the HPV vaccine.

232
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:41,390
So I don't think we are in our statistics now seeing the effect of the HPV vaccine on these cancers, really that maybe just starting first cervical.

233
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:42,200
Does that make sense?

234
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:54,889
So any any differences in any sex related differences, any country differences are not really due to differences in vaccination rates right now.

235
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:57,950
In ten, 20 years, we're going to start to see that play out.

236
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:04,280
Right now, it is all due to differences in potentially sexual behaviors for the male cancers.

237
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:10,120
And really. Screening for the cervical cancers.

238
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,990
Yup. Right now.

239
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:19,059
You had asked about the difference in HPV in men and women.

240
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:23,680
So it's always bigger. Like if you actually look at the rates, they are always much bigger in women.

241
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:29,620
Right. It's not 100. You have to when you make the graphs in global can you have to be a little bit

242
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:33,609
careful about whether you're keeping the I can't remember what they call it,

243
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:44,140
but you can have them big quintiles within that cancer for that sex or you can have it be the same across sexes, I guess like a set.

244
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:50,390
A set of cufflinks.

245
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:58,010
And if you do that, you'll see that it's actually much lower in that even though it is higher than in the U.S. compared to other places.

246
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:01,460
The reason men are always love with other women. Does that make sense?

247
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:08,040
Yes. This doesn't pertain to that. But I just wanted to clarify the.

248
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:16,430
So dysplasia is really kind of on the pathway to cancer, right?

249
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:20,540
So don't go from like we're normal. Everything's fine to like, boom, we're cancer cells, right?

250
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:27,200
They kind of go through this continuous process of, like, getting weirder and broader and more cancer, like.

251
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:30,889
And dysplasia is kind of on that path. Right.

252
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:34,370
And dysplasia are the pre-cancerous lesions that we're looking for.

253
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:41,389
Right. So if you can catch it when it's dysplasia, it won't have invaded anything and it won't become cancer and cut it out.

254
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:45,800
You're done, right. That's what cervical cancer screening is hoping to achieve.

255
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:52,290
That's why cervical cancer screening is actually so effective and why hopefully colonoscopies,

256
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:56,560
despite this trial, are very effective is because we know what the precancerous lesion is,

257
00:27:56,560 --> 00:28:03,600
the display, this classic lesion, and we can find it and take it out before it ever has the chance to become cancer.

258
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:07,900
So those screening programs are reducing both incidence and mortality.

259
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:17,290
Right. Yes, sure.

260
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:25,570
Here's my ugly picture. So this was the ugly picture, right?

261
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:30,810
So, you know, you go from normal to cancer and there's kind of this process along the way.

262
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:39,920
So you have premium plastic lesions that I would say, do we have a list here of like no grief?

263
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:47,950
I think there's a slide in here that is like known pre neoplastic lesions, but I can't find them at the moment.

264
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:53,820
The CIA. The skin lesions yap.

265
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:04,620
There you go. Found it. Okay, so there's dysplasia in the cervix.

266
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:09,480
Those are the lesions. Circle intraepithelial neoplasia is what that stands for.

267
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:14,940
So some lesions or other pretty impressive lesions for cervix.

268
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,929
This black there's dysplasia and the front is a smoker's dysplasia.

269
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:23,100
And Barrett's esophagus. So do you guys know what Barrett's esophagus is?

270
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,030
It's like a type of, like, really severe reflux, essentially.

271
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:30,930
So acid reflux into the base of the esophagus and you can get dysplasia in that

272
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:35,430
lower part of the esophagus that is continually irritated by the stomach acid.

273
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:45,930
There's also the polyps in the colon. Right. So if I asked you to give me two examples of premium plastic lesions, you now have four, right?

274
00:29:51,940 --> 00:30:00,160
Yes. So. So, like, it's just like anything before cancer.

275
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:06,760
Neoplasia is cancer. So prenatal plastic free neoplasia is anything before cancer.

276
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:14,860
So it's kind of anything in this. Hyperplasia to carcinoma in situ, right.

277
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:19,840
Usually when we can find it, it is somewhere in the dysplasia realm.

278
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:27,280
Yeah. Yes.

279
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:40,760
Yes. So cancer, stem cell therapy. So we talked about this 19 year old find it now the multi stage model where you need 3 to 7 hits.

280
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,090
Right.

281
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:51,860
And the idea originally is that any cell in the body could could sustain those 3 to 7 hits and therefore become kind of the the beginning of a cancer.

282
00:30:52,880 --> 00:31:03,800
But, uh, a widely accepted theory at this point is that it's not really any cell in the body that sustains these hits and gives rise to cancer.

283
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,060
Rather, it is stem cells.

284
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:13,790
So there are stem cells in every tissue in the body and they can live much longer or they can kind of regenerate themselves and live for a long,

285
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:20,540
long time. So the idea is that they are around long enough to sustain those 3 to 7 hits that then give rise to cancer.

286
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:30,589
And so the idea behind this, the treatment idea behind this is that if that is true, you know, so only normal.

287
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:35,690
The idea is that only normal stem cells reproduce themselves and are therefore around long enough to accumulate those changes.

288
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:39,860
So people are trying to target these stem cells for therapy.

289
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:48,409
Right. The idea is that if you have a regular chemotherapy or radiation is killing off the cancer cells, but not the cancer stem cells.

290
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:53,000
So you might shrink the tumor, but it will come back because the stem cell is still there.

291
00:31:54,140 --> 00:32:02,750
However, if you can target the stem cell with some kind of therapy, it'll just die off and then the rest of the tumor will also down is the idea.

292
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,340
So this has not yet been realized. People are working on this.

293
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:10,820
It's not. Has not been achieved yet.

294
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:18,930
But this is the theory. And the the stem cell theory of cancer is definitely one that people it has become much more accepted.

295
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:23,090
People mostly think that that is kind of true at this point. Does that make sense?

296
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:33,090
Any other questions on those? Yes.

297
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:42,730
Yes. So how are they different? What is the stage? Can anybody tell me what stages?

298
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:49,540
Yes. How far it spread and how big it is, right?

299
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:57,610
Yes. Because you can have there's a couple stages to three stages which are still kind of within the organ of origin, but just smaller versus bigger.

300
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:04,690
And then stage three is usually it's kind of invaded things nearby and then stage four as it has metastasized further.

301
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:08,440
So stage is about how big it is and how far it has spread from the organ where it started.

302
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:12,990
Great. On the other hand, is what. Yes.

303
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,510
Yes. Yes.

304
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:24,170
How differentiated it is, exactly how much the cells under a microscope look like the tissue they're supposed to be.

305
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:31,130
Right. That's exactly right. So you can have a little bitty stage one tumor that is very differentiated, that is high grade.

306
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:35,150
Right. Or you could even have a big tumor that's been there for a slow growing for a long time.

307
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:42,500
That's pretty well differentiated, right? So often say integrated travel is more common, I think,

308
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:48,829
to hide a high stage tumor that is also really high grade because it tends to be more aggressive and therefore progressed to that large stage.

309
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:55,440
Right. But you can't have they they aren't necessarily tracking perfectly with each other.

310
00:33:55,460 --> 00:34:01,060
Right. That makes sense. They're kind of looking at two different aspects of tumor aggressiveness.

311
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:04,370
Right. So both of those are related to prognosis.

312
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:07,940
Both higher stage and higher grade are related to worse prognosis.

313
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:12,410
Those are more aggressive tumors generally. Right.

314
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:20,460
All right. I'm going to go to the Familial Cancer Syndromes Lecture and answer the question now from over here.

315
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:27,960
I can't remember who asked him about being a typically versus genetic phenotypically dominant but genetically recessive.

316
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:35,580
Okay, so pretend it's like 1965 and we don't know about these cancer genes, right?

317
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:43,470
We don't know. We do know that we have a family that has a ton of colon cancer and we make a pedigree of them.

318
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:47,640
Grandpa had colon cancer. He had four kids. Two of them got colon cancer.

319
00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:54,450
They each had four kids. Two of their kids got colon cancer. What does that sound like to you for the phenotype of cancer?

320
00:34:56,070 --> 00:35:02,280
One affected parent and 50% of the offspring. Get it? In Mendelian genetics, what does that sound like?

321
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:09,269
Autosomal dominant autosomal just means it's not on a sex chromosome.

322
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:14,639
Inside non-sex chromosome and dominant means one copy of the gene seems to be sufficient to give you a disease.

323
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:20,100
Right. That is the pattern of inheritance that red flags for autism, Wahhabism, the dominant disorder.

324
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:23,910
Right. That one parent has it and half their kids get it.

325
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:31,200
So it's 1965. You don't know anything about the gene, but we can say there's probably an autism or dominant cancer related disorder in this family.

326
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:40,290
Hay fever typically looks dominant. So we start calling this disorder whatever be say.

327
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:45,120
And we say it's an autism spectrum disorder based on that, based on the phenotype and pedigree.

328
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:53,670
Now we fast forward and we're in the nineties of 2014. Oh, we figured out what a tumor suppressor gene is and we now know how they work.

329
00:35:54,330 --> 00:36:00,090
We now know that you actually have to lose two copies of a tumor suppressor gene in order for cancer to actually happen.

330
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:07,530
Right. And we know that the gene that's causing this disorder in this family is the APC gene.

331
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:08,550
It's a tumor suppressor gene.

332
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:18,420
So now we know that what's really going on is that this person is born with one bad copy, but they're really likely because that's such a huge hit.

333
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:23,940
And it's in every cell in their body. Right, every cell in their body. So there's so many chances for that second one to get lost.

334
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:30,389
And then the rest of those 3 to 7 hits that are needed to cause cancer type two to accumulate that in their lifetime,

335
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:35,040
it's just really, really likely that with one bad copy, they're going to lose that other one and end up getting cancer.

336
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:41,490
So we know that at the genotype level now we know at the genotype level you actually have to lose both copies.

337
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:45,960
So, Gene, typically we know it's actually recessive because you have to lose two copies in order to get the disease.

338
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:49,410
But when you just look at the phenotype,

339
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:55,049
it looks like an autism will dominant disorder because losing that second copy and accumulating the other hits necessary

340
00:36:55,050 --> 00:37:01,470
to lead to cancer in a person who already has one part in a major gene like that does so much more than our lifetime.

341
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,010
Does that make sense? Does that help?

342
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:12,809
So that is why in the literature you will see these things referred to as autosomal dominant disorders, and then you will be like,

343
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:17,700
But Dr. Mandel told me that it's a tumor suppressor gene and I know you have to lose both copies, so that doesn't make any sense.

344
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:26,070
That's why they were kind of called that based on the phenotype of cancer before we ever knew exactly what was going on with the genes.

345
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:32,160
Does that make sense? They behaved in a category and had a family life.

346
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:37,469
And I dissembled on the disorder because losing that second copy and accumulating the other changes

347
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:42,030
necessary to cause cancer is so likely when you come here with one fifth of that critical gene.

348
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:49,160
Yeah. Yes. So again.

349
00:37:57,140 --> 00:38:00,320
No, this is a totally separate point. So this point is about.

350
00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:08,930
Okay, so the next point. Why are familial cancer syndromes confer a high risk for cancer but contribute little to the population attributable risk?

351
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:12,590
This is just a math problem. So population attributable risk.

352
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:22,040
If I make a pie chart of colon cancer, this is all the colon cancer in the US, right?

353
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:25,760
And we did this. There's that. I'm not going to draw it because I said a slide.

354
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:29,030
I'm just going to open the slide because that makes more sense.

355
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:34,790
And it's prettier than I can draw it. Group.

356
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:42,530
Pie chart. Here we go. Okay. So this is all of the colon cancer in the US.

357
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:48,050
Most of it 65 to 85% of it happens in people who are at average risk genetic.

358
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:53,570
Right. And it's due to, I don't know, diet and BMI and smoking and whatever else.

359
00:38:53,780 --> 00:39:02,240
Right. This card piece accounts for 1% of all cancers are caused by a baby.

360
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:10,370
Right now, if you have an APC gene mutation, your personal risk of getting colon cancer is super, super high.

361
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:16,040
Right. The relative risk associated with having that gene is really, really high.

362
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:21,710
But it only accounts for such a tiny proportion of colon cancers because it's rare.

363
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:29,180
So the population attributable risk is is this that's what this is what proportion

364
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:33,190
of colon cancer in the population can be explained by this hereditary mutation?

365
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:40,540
And it's very little. The reason is because it's rare, even though the individual risk when you have it is super high.

366
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:43,580
It's very, very rare. So few cancers can be explained by it.

367
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:47,120
On the other hand, those common genetic changes,

368
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:52,010
like the example we gave of in that two gene of gene that the change how your body

369
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:59,390
deals with environmental carcinogens for example right in that picture with the gas.

370
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:05,300
It's over here. Maybe. Remember this picture?

371
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:12,770
These are those things that we're talking about that have a low population attributable risk but very high relative risk.

372
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:15,740
P53 mutation. What does that caused you remember?

373
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:27,829
It is a tumor suppressor, but you remember which if you if you have a mutated p53, do you remember which familial syndrome you have from the from Amy.

374
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:32,490
That's right. APC Which one is that? That's FFP.

375
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:38,090
That's right. MLH What I'm saying to each and P.C.C.

376
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:41,510
BRCA1 and two cause familial breast and ovarian cancers, right?

377
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:49,040
So we talked about a few of these. These if you have this your are your risk of cancer is super high, but very few people have it.

378
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:53,570
So they they account for very few of these cancers that occur.

379
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:57,950
Right. On the other hand, these things out here.

380
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,850
Are really common. The relative risk.

381
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:15,940
If you have a Q 24 mutation or change in your IQ 2014, your risk of cancer is, I don't know, like 1.2, four times that of people who don't maybe.

382
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:20,320
Right? It's a little bit higher. Your risk is a little higher.

383
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:24,370
They account for a large proportion of cancers, though.

384
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:29,140
They contribute to a large proportion of cancers that occur in the population because they are very common.

385
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:34,270
Okay. So that is kind of the balance for population attributable risk.

386
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:38,260
The kind of the the, the big nasty are things that like smoking.

387
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:46,419
Smoking is a huge population of people cause it's pretty common and it also has a humongous relative risk, particularly for lung cancer.

388
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:52,600
Right. But another example of things like like these that might have an individual very high risk,

389
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:57,390
but a low population attributable risk is maybe like some occupational exposures for cancer, right?

390
00:41:58,270 --> 00:42:00,549
Like there's certain chemicals that if you get exposed to them,

391
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:07,390
occupationally meaning in a really high at a really high level compared to most people like your risk might be super high,

392
00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:10,150
but very few people are exposed at that high level.

393
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:17,490
And so those kinds of exposures, those chemical exposures usually contribute to a small proportion of overall the cancers.

394
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:24,760
Does this help with the population attributable risk idea? Yes.

395
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:30,010
Excellent. In terms of the type of person low.

396
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:36,660
Hello, Dr. Sleep. Penetrance is essentially you can think of it as being related to relative risk.

397
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:42,840
Right. The penetrance is the probability that you're going to get the disease. Okay.

398
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:46,560
So if you have all of these genes you're faced with, I think they're probably right.

399
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:53,070
P53 mutation, the penetrance is like 100%, almost double that.

400
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,830
And there but there's a low attribute of the population of people.

401
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:06,140
That means the number of colon cancers or, you know, see the number of colon cancer is in the population due to increasing mutations is very small.

402
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:11,750
Because they're rare low is. Yeah.

403
00:43:11,810 --> 00:43:15,400
So these are low penetrance, meaning the relative risk associated.

404
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:20,810
If you have your if you have this mutation, the probability you get cancer is pretty well.

405
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:29,220
Right. Yeah. Those are sporadic first.

406
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:40,740
These are probably I mean, I would say that these are yes, you know, the difference between hereditary and sporadic is a little bit unclear.

407
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:46,920
Right. So, you know, you might be looking at something sort of in here as a hereditary.

408
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:51,360
Hereditary means it kind of shows up in a in a family like that.

409
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:57,060
Family has a higher risk, but you can't pin down a particular gene or a particular familial syndrome.

410
00:43:57,750 --> 00:44:08,880
Remember, if you look at. Now.

411
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:13,390
I think it was back here before I went into the examples. Did Google do?

412
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:22,610
It's a good table to have here. So these are really high penetrance.

413
00:44:22,610 --> 00:44:27,950
These are the percentage are factors like your APC mutation, your lead remaining syndrome.

414
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:32,750
They have they're very rare. They have a really clear familial hereditary pattern.

415
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:39,079
If you do a pedigree of these guys, it's gonna look really clear that there's something it's going to look like an the dominant kind of situation.

416
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:45,380
It's going to be really, really clear that something's going on. Really high stress association mean penetrance, right?

417
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:56,180
For that individual, their risk is very high, but low population attributable risk, these low penetrance ones, it might be equivocal.

418
00:44:56,180 --> 00:45:02,509
So sometimes you're going to see something in the family. Sometimes you want the ones where you do see something in a family.

419
00:45:02,510 --> 00:45:07,010
Those we call for monitoring. Right. So it's a very it's not easy.

420
00:45:07,010 --> 00:45:08,630
It's very easy to put these in a box.

421
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:19,790
It's really hard to put the specific genes in a box of, oh, this is just, you know, a common change versus something that causes hereditary cancer.

422
00:45:19,790 --> 00:45:27,109
Right? So I think if you have one of these less strong genetic changes in your family, it could show up in a pedigree.

423
00:45:27,110 --> 00:45:30,769
Right, depending on what it is. And then you would call that hereditary cancer.

424
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:34,310
But I'm not going to ask you to give me an example of a hereditary cancer.

425
00:45:34,850 --> 00:45:40,820
I'm going to give you an example. I might ask you to give me an example of a familial cancer syndrome.

426
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:45,290
Right. Because those are clear. That's the point, is that those are very clearly different.

427
00:45:45,950 --> 00:45:52,370
So remember this picture about colon cancer, familiar risk for colon cancer.

428
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:59,210
So if you if this is about how many first degree relatives you have, remember, first degree is like a parent, a sibling or a child.

429
00:46:00,350 --> 00:46:08,450
You have not your lifetime risk is like 2%. You got one your lifetime versus 6%, even if you have 2/1 degree relatives who have colon cancer.

430
00:46:08,450 --> 00:46:14,300
So that's a pretty if you had a family tree, that would be, you know, like the looks like there was a familial pattern going on.

431
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:20,120
White farmers is 17%. If you have that mutation, your lifetime risk is seven.

432
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:29,700
So I can't tell you exactly what jeans go in this box, but I sure can tell you which ones go here because it's so clearly different.

433
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:36,430
Does that make sense? Yeah. So some genes that like if you find down here,

434
00:46:36,450 --> 00:46:42,720
like people who have one or one and a couple of second degree relatives, you're not going to be able to see.

435
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:47,280
It's not going to be as clear on a quantitative reading that something is going on in this family,

436
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,910
which is why in that blue column, it says it's equivocal.

437
00:46:51,070 --> 00:46:54,270
You might not see a really strong, clear pattern in a family.

438
00:46:54,810 --> 00:47:03,180
Maybe some, but, you know, those are those like more common lower level of risk kind of changes probably to the.

439
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:12,080
Right? No. Equivocal in that you look at the pedigree and you're like, I don't know, maybe a right.

440
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:18,590
As opposed to like when you look at one of these pedigrees, you're like, oh, oh, yeah, right now you've got a super thing, right?

441
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:24,770
So the point is, like, it's really hard to separate these out from each other.

442
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:28,370
I mean, it's getting stronger. Maybe there's something going on. These people, I don't know.

443
00:47:28,370 --> 00:47:34,110
I can't really tell from their pedigree. But like these people, this is clearly different, right?

444
00:47:34,130 --> 00:47:44,930
So this is what happens when you have a a germline change in a very key tumor suppressor gene or DNA repair gene.

445
00:47:45,170 --> 00:47:50,270
Right. So.

446
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:57,240
Does that help? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

447
00:47:57,690 --> 00:48:05,700
What's the r one? RB is the retinoblastoma the the eye one in kids.

448
00:48:07,110 --> 00:48:10,470
This one. That is another one that we talked about.

449
00:48:10,530 --> 00:48:15,510
Right. So if I ask you to give me an example, you could say the RV gene causes retinoblastoma eye cancer in kids.

450
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:23,840
Right. Okay.

451
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:32,540
Any other questions up through familial cancer syndromes? Yes.

452
00:48:40,290 --> 00:48:47,370
Yes. So that is this pretty picture, remember?

453
00:48:47,610 --> 00:48:47,910
Right.

454
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:56,550
So in these hereditary cancers, so this is the increase in cancer risk with increasing exposure in the hereditary cancers, it almost doesn't matter.

455
00:48:56,580 --> 00:49:01,020
Right. Like you could do everything right and like never dye your hair and never smoke and never drink alcohol.

456
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:04,950
And like, if you had one of those just by chance, you probably would end up getting cancer.

457
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:13,280
Right. With these guys, remember, the role of the environment is super important.

458
00:49:13,290 --> 00:49:18,480
Remember this picture with the net too. So that the people who are the.

459
00:49:21,290 --> 00:49:26,689
Rapid, subtle leaders were less likely to get cancer because they're getting rid of

460
00:49:26,690 --> 00:49:31,700
they're excreting this toxin from cigaret smoke before it can ever cause cancer,

461
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:38,530
whereas if they're slow acetylation, it can go can linger around and go down this hepatic activation pathway and actually cause mutations.

462
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:45,079
Right. So if you look the slowest headliners of the dark blue here for every level of cigaret smoking,

463
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:51,110
they actually have an increased risk of bladder cancer compared to those that were rapid acetylation.

464
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:57,320
So in this case, remember, the rapid acetylation are probably kind of these resistant folks,

465
00:49:57,320 --> 00:50:02,570
whereas maybe the intermediate or the general and then the slow people are more susceptible but only to cigaret smoke.

466
00:50:02,570 --> 00:50:07,790
So vs the role of exposure is really very important because if you've never smoked it kind of wouldn't

467
00:50:07,790 --> 00:50:14,509
matter or you were never in any way exposed to Erol means it probably wouldn't matter what you're doing.

468
00:50:14,510 --> 00:50:17,780
The type for that too was. Does that make sense?

469
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:21,949
So for hereditary cancers, it's really not about environment.

470
00:50:21,950 --> 00:50:28,009
It's really you have a mutation in a key cancer related gene, a tumor suppressor gene, right.

471
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:30,440
Or a DNA repair gene, something very key.

472
00:50:31,010 --> 00:50:39,409
Whereas these guys, it's more about you are more susceptible or resistant to environmental exposures causing trouble based on this genotype.

473
00:50:39,410 --> 00:50:50,180
Does that make sense? All right.

474
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:59,060
Any other questions up through familial cancer syndromes? Cancer registration.

475
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:09,010
Yes. So we talked about they did collect some.

476
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:24,770
Here. Remember these slides? Yep. Demographics.

477
00:51:24,770 --> 00:51:26,780
And then also some clinical stuff about the tumor.

478
00:51:29,690 --> 00:51:38,149
Your first course of treatment, stuff about follow ups of recurrence, second primaries, deaths, and also some medical identifiers.

479
00:51:38,150 --> 00:51:43,970
But remember, we talked about what was missing. So they're not collecting exposures you might be interested in or somebody's smoking or BMI.

480
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:53,360
Right. That kind of thing. So it's really for documenting the cancers and information about the cancer.

481
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:59,900
If you want to do additional kind of like etiologic work, looking at risk factors of risk of cancer,

482
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:05,719
you're going to have to go back to those patients and ask them more questions or somehow look at something not on your own.

483
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:10,350
Because that's. With the help of the registry.

484
00:52:14,890 --> 00:52:19,360
Any other cancer registration question? Yes.

485
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:25,060
They're playing the. Right.

486
00:52:25,150 --> 00:52:31,000
So a few. Right. So they provide all this data that gives us hypothesis generation, right?

487
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:36,459
Like so you can see what trends are going on and it can help you maybe hypothesize, oh, there's something going on with this cancer.

488
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:38,650
I wonder what it is. Let's try to figure that out. Right.

489
00:52:39,250 --> 00:52:46,479
So they can they also can help you do studies like before and after certain things are done in the population.

490
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:51,910
So like we can have data from before and after the implementation of the Affordable Care Act in this country, for example.

491
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:58,420
Right. It can you know, so part of the hypothesis generation is like differences between groups.

492
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:03,430
So we we get a lot of our information about there being important racial disparities from cancer registries.

493
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:08,470
Right. That's how we know that. We know what cancers are changing over time, that kind of thing.

494
00:53:09,730 --> 00:53:16,690
We know, like I said, we know if interventions have to have had an impact potentially like the smoking, right.

495
00:53:16,690 --> 00:53:21,669
We can see lung cancer coming down very nicely after smoking is coming down.

496
00:53:21,670 --> 00:53:28,959
So that's that's important. Uh, also that can be good source of cases for studies, right?

497
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:33,400
So if you want to identify cases of cancer, especially like a rare cancer,

498
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:36,970
you can go collect all of the cases from the registry and then find controls.

499
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:41,260
And of course, the registry is population based, so you know where they're from.

500
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:46,510
You can go get controls from that same place, right? Maybe through DMV or something like that.

501
00:53:47,170 --> 00:53:51,220
So it can be a source of cases for studies. Does that help?

502
00:53:55,030 --> 00:53:59,710
I mean, basically, you can't do any cancer control work if you don't know what the problem is.

503
00:54:02,310 --> 00:54:06,570
You can't address a problem if you don't know what the problem is. So that's what registries help us with.

504
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:17,830
Other registry questions. Yes.

505
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:26,730
Yeah. The PCR is the, is the non seer.

506
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:33,870
Right. So in the US we've got Seer which was kind of started earlier and then NPR so serious through NIH and C.I.

507
00:54:33,930 --> 00:54:39,450
Right. And then the CDC kind of makes up the difference up to like 90% of the population.

508
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:59,710
The registration or etiology and study design. Yes.

509
00:55:00,410 --> 00:55:08,320
Oh, I love the blast. Well, the cancer pancreatic cancer was the.

510
00:55:08,530 --> 00:55:16,110
Selection bias the. In the hospital being treated for with the control.

511
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:23,120
Yes. So the problem is when you hit controls, right?

512
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:28,870
I'm just like turning in circles. I'm like, I don't know what I'm doing. I'm going to circle, okay?

513
00:55:29,470 --> 00:55:38,680
So when you're doing a study, you have some source population, right?

514
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:51,120
And you've got your cases. You want your control in order to not have selection bias,

515
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:57,240
your controls must be a random sample of people from your source population who do not have cancer.

516
00:55:58,470 --> 00:56:05,490
Problems happen when you accidentally get controls that are not reflective of your source population that gave rise to your cases.

517
00:56:06,270 --> 00:56:10,020
So in the McMahon example, they were getting their cases.

518
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:15,870
The source population was what people who worked.

519
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:21,970
To these x number of GI docs.

520
00:56:24,990 --> 00:56:32,420
Or pancreatic cancer. Right. The problem is that this is like this is I think, if I remember correctly, it was like a church.

521
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,330
It was like a Harvard kind of situation. Right?

522
00:56:34,330 --> 00:56:40,569
Like it was a people were coming from multiple places to be treated by these doctors for pancreatic cancer,

523
00:56:40,570 --> 00:56:44,590
whereas then they also treated people for other things that might have been just from the community.

524
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:51,580
So they were trying to like get they were trying to address this underlying population is like, okay,

525
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:57,340
well, people who come to these doctors for other things are probably from the same population, right?

526
00:56:58,690 --> 00:57:01,440
Except they weren't. They were like sick people. Right.

527
00:57:01,450 --> 00:57:06,850
So you had the source population is like all these healthy people who, if they got sick, would have gone to those doctors.

528
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:14,470
But what you ended up doing was only getting like the sick people. As your controls.

529
00:57:15,550 --> 00:57:20,379
So it is not a representative sample of the source population that gave rise to your cases

530
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:24,760
because you're getting only the sick people from your source population also went to that doctor.

531
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:31,060
They were going to a guy doctor for stomach problems. So you have people who have stomach problems and your exposure was coffee.

532
00:57:31,630 --> 00:57:38,860
So what happened is you have your disease and your non disease cases and your controls, your expose and you're unexposed.

533
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:39,339
In this case,

534
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:47,860
exposed was drinking a lot of coffee and your non disease people were much less likely to be exposed because they were sick and going to a GI doc.

535
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:54,910
So you have a selection bias because it was by both disease and exposure.

536
00:57:54,910 --> 00:58:00,770
The way you picked your non disease people was different by exposure.

537
00:58:00,790 --> 00:58:04,510
So you ended up picking differentially by both disease and exposure.

538
00:58:04,530 --> 00:58:09,010
One cell of your two by two table was altered by the way you picked your people.

539
00:58:13,850 --> 00:58:18,940
Does that make sense? Yeah. So. An increase or decrease in work.

540
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:21,310
So this is correct. Yes.

541
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:38,360
Now, if you had just for whatever reason, like the health professionals example, right, you end up with, say, for whatever reason you, uh.

542
00:58:43,550 --> 00:58:48,770
This was in a I'm trying to think of something that makes sense about coffee.

543
00:58:50,030 --> 00:58:57,899
Who do you think is like a population that drinks a ton of coffee? So like an ethnic group or college students?

544
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:01,770
Yes, college students. So say you want to do it doesn't make a lot of sense for pancreatic cancer.

545
00:59:01,770 --> 00:59:07,559
But say for whatever reason, you did this study with some disease that occurs more likely in college students.

546
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:12,240
Right. Say, I don't know, ADHD. You wanted to screen people for ADHD, right?

547
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:14,760
So you got all your college students with ADHD.

548
00:59:15,030 --> 00:59:19,770
You asked about their coffee exposure and then you got all your got a bunch of college students who didn't have ADHD.

549
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:24,780
But what happens is you just end up with a lot of coffee drinkers, like more than the general population.

550
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:29,920
So this. This is a two by two table, right?

551
00:59:30,550 --> 00:59:34,990
I have made it ugly now, but it's two by two. This is your marginal here.

552
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:40,750
It's just the total number of exposed people in your in your study, regardless of disease status.

553
00:59:41,110 --> 00:59:46,870
This is just higher than the average, the general population, because just college students just drink a lot of coffee.

554
00:59:47,110 --> 00:59:51,100
That's fine. That might be a generalizability problem.

555
00:59:52,750 --> 01:00:02,520
It's not a selection bias problem. In a in a population of college students who on average drank a lot of coffee.

556
01:00:03,090 --> 01:00:06,330
The association between coffee, drinking and ADHD was X-Y-Z.

557
01:00:07,230 --> 01:00:14,050
Maybe it wouldn't be the same in a different population that didn't drink as much coffee, or that was different in some way.

558
01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:16,050
Weren't college students? Right.

559
01:00:16,710 --> 01:00:23,940
So you might have a select population that changes the prevalence of exposure in your study compared to the general population.

560
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:29,610
But that is not a selection bias because you didn't choose them in a way that changed one's self.

561
01:00:31,230 --> 01:00:43,860
Correct. I will tell you that this is something everybody struggles with.

562
01:00:44,730 --> 01:00:53,090
Like, I'll read a paper and be like. It doesn't feel right.

563
01:00:53,110 --> 01:00:56,829
I don't know. Is it a general generalizability problem or is this really a selection bias problem?

564
01:00:56,830 --> 01:01:01,959
I actually have like write out tables and think that I mean, this is not always intuitive.

565
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:03,970
It's not always 100% clear.

566
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:09,550
But what I do hope you come away from this class with is the knowledge that there are these two things that are intertwined.

567
01:01:09,970 --> 01:01:14,820
They're difficult to tell apart. People often get them confused with each other, and it's really good to, like,

568
01:01:15,790 --> 01:01:19,540
think it through with somebody maybe who has more methods, knowledge than you.

569
01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:23,260
If you're trying to suss out one of these problems, that's number one.

570
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:26,950
The number two thing I want you to come away with is understanding that designing

571
01:01:26,950 --> 01:01:30,700
a case control study such that you don't have selection bias is really,

572
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:38,980
really hard. It's really easy to do it wrong to pick your controls in a way that introduces selection bias.

573
01:01:39,990 --> 01:01:45,210
Hard to do. And you're definitely probably going to do it if you pick hospital based control.

574
01:01:45,230 --> 01:01:49,140
So don't do that. That is a bad idea.

575
01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:53,850
Poor, poor McMahon. He stumbled so we could.

576
01:01:53,850 --> 01:01:57,620
All right. We all learn from him. No hospital based controls.

577
01:02:07,540 --> 01:02:13,960
Yes. Okay. So there are basically three main kinds of bias.

578
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:23,020
They are selection bias. Confounding and information bias, which is also called misclassification.

579
01:02:24,190 --> 01:02:29,190
There are specific kinds of each of these all biases can be stuck into one of these categories.

580
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:35,590
And recall bias is a kind of misclassification that happens because of how people remember.

581
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:39,910
Okay. So.

582
01:02:43,410 --> 01:02:54,090
Recall bias happens when your cases and your controls remember their exposure differently because they're more or less motivated to remember,

583
01:02:54,090 --> 01:03:00,210
or because they think that they know what exposure you're studying and they're embarrassed about.

584
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:03,780
They feel like they cause their disease and they don't want to tell you or whatever it is.

585
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:04,110
Right.

586
01:03:05,190 --> 01:03:12,660
So you can imagine a lot of scenarios in which people who already have the disease might remember or report things differently than people who don't.

587
01:03:14,010 --> 01:03:17,270
That is recall bias. You are getting information bias.

588
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:27,030
You're getting different. You are getting a different degree of misclassification in your cases, in your controls,

589
01:03:27,030 --> 01:03:30,600
because they're either reporting to you or remembering their exposure. History different.

590
01:03:31,810 --> 01:03:37,170
Okay. That is pretty much only going to happen in a case control study where you're asking

591
01:03:37,170 --> 01:03:43,670
people who already have the disease to remember something that happened beforehand. You could also just have.

592
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:51,259
There are other ways to get differential this classification that is an example of differential misclassification where the

593
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:59,899
degree of misclassification of the exposure is different in your cases and your controls and that can bias in any direction.

594
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:01,130
It just causes a big mess.

595
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:10,139
Non differential misclassification is where the misclassification of either your exposure is not differentially different by disease

596
01:04:10,140 --> 01:04:17,160
status or misclassification of your disease status is not different by exposure because you can have misclassification of either.

597
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:25,380
This is if it is non differential biased toward the null generally.

598
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:29,370
That was the example with the with the colorectal cancer study that we saw.

599
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:35,510
This can happen. The example I always like to give of this is diet.

600
01:04:35,650 --> 01:04:41,150
Right. Everybody kind of remembers their diet badly. It doesn't really have anything to do with whether you currently have disease or not.

601
01:04:41,150 --> 01:04:47,480
People are just bad at it. Probably the same degree of badness if people who did it did not get the disease.

602
01:04:48,650 --> 01:04:54,800
In a cohort study where you are assessing exposure at baseline before anybody has the disease,

603
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:01,850
it is difficult to imagine how that reported exposure is going to be different by their

604
01:05:01,850 --> 01:05:06,829
future disease status because they don't know right now who going to have the disease.

605
01:05:06,830 --> 01:05:14,389
Right. So it is difficult to imagine a scenario in which exposure misclassification is

606
01:05:14,390 --> 01:05:17,990
differential by disease status if you are asking it before they have the disease.

607
01:05:22,310 --> 01:05:29,600
Now with cancer because there is this long latency period, somebody could maybe be experiencing symptoms and not know that they have cancer.

608
01:05:29,990 --> 01:05:34,280
That could be it. Or they could just not know. They could not even be experiencing symptoms.

609
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:42,889
But maybe if you took a blood sample, something would be a little off. That is potentially that's a that's what we call reverse causation.

610
01:05:42,890 --> 01:05:48,150
Right. The disease is actually causing these changes. That's why we sometimes introduce a lag.

611
01:05:50,310 --> 01:05:54,960
Right. But maybe only look at people who didn't get cancer for the first few years in the study or something.

612
01:05:54,990 --> 01:06:00,260
Right. So but that does that help with your question? And I see a hand over here.

613
01:06:00,950 --> 01:06:04,320
So basically just. Differential is like.

614
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:09,720
The control and. Yes.

615
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:15,090
The degree of wrongness of the direction of this is the same.

616
01:06:16,140 --> 01:06:21,390
Both recall bias is a very common source of differential, this classification.

617
01:06:23,890 --> 01:06:26,190
You're asking people to remember something you already have.

618
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:32,469
Which is why for case control studies, you always try to go back and get something a little bit more objective,

619
01:06:32,470 --> 01:06:36,410
like you might go back to the medical background or, you know, to try to get something that's not just.

620
01:06:45,830 --> 01:06:58,630
All right. Any other questions on anything? Okay.

621
01:06:58,810 --> 01:07:06,549
I always have everybody ask me like, how long does it take? I always say, I hate that question because everybody's a different kind of test taker.

622
01:07:06,550 --> 01:07:10,870
I was always the test taker that I went straight through and I did not go back and recheck it because if I did,

623
01:07:10,870 --> 01:07:13,930
I would like second guess myself and talk myself into the wrong answer.

624
01:07:14,650 --> 01:07:18,730
So I just wanted my gut. I did the whole thing and I'm done. I turned it down like no double checking.

625
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:23,170
Other people that I recognize are the complete opposite credit test taker.

626
01:07:23,170 --> 01:07:24,040
And they will go reach out.

627
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:28,389
They will take if you give them an hour in 20 minutes, they will take an hour and 20 minutes and they will go recheck everything.

628
01:07:28,390 --> 01:07:33,520
And that is also totally fine. So I don't like to say like how long it'll take.

629
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:36,600
Some people will get up halfway through it be done, other people take the whole time.

630
01:07:36,820 --> 01:07:40,240
Totally fine. Either way, I will say that I have not designed this test.

631
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:49,180
So that time is the challenge and I have very infrequently in this class had people who didn't finish because of time.

632
01:07:50,770 --> 01:07:53,379
That's still B don't you feel like?

633
01:07:53,380 --> 01:07:58,000
I'm sure it's fine and like give me do look through it like try to manage your time but like generally that's not the issue.

634
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:04,210
Yeah. The format is there are some it's a little bit of everything.

635
01:08:04,690 --> 01:08:08,560
Your favorite question will probably be on there. Unless you love matching. I don't think I have any magic.

636
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:11,560
So I've got some true false. I've got some multiple choice.

637
01:08:11,950 --> 01:08:17,049
I got some like short fill in the blank kind of things or like give me a sentence kind of answers.

638
01:08:17,050 --> 01:08:21,700
And then I've got like four questions I think that are like, give me half a page.

639
01:08:24,670 --> 01:08:28,900
So a little more like I want to see the right answer to that is not yes.

640
01:08:29,170 --> 01:08:33,220
The right answer to that is like think it through on paper for me a little bit.

641
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:41,450
Okay. Everybody's going to pack your best handwriting, right?

642
01:08:41,470 --> 01:08:45,460
You're going to open your bag. You're to put my best handwriting in there tonight so that it's in there for you.

643
01:08:45,470 --> 01:08:56,810
Right. Anything else going on is in place.

644
01:09:01,030 --> 01:09:05,399
All right. I will see you Thursday in this room.

645
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:06,480
Hour and 20 minutes.
