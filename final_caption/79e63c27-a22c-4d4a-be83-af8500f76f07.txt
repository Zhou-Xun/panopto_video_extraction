1
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:11,760
All right, everyone, why don't we get started? Welcome back.

2
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:21,420
I hope you all had a nice, restful weekend. And today what we're going to do in class is touch upon three things.

3
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:27,359
So the first thing we'll talk about are these aren't single nutrient recommendations and

4
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:32,310
there's a couple of them that different types of recommendations that we'll talk through.

5
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:38,430
And then we're going to talk about something that's really a little bit more broader in terms of promoting health.

6
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:46,709
They're called the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. And these are two basic concepts that are really just like a foundation of nutrient or

7
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:51,840
dietary recommendation or guidelines that we'll keep coming back to in every life stage.

8
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:57,900
So I just want to make sure we all have, you know, the sort of basic foundational concepts of what these are.

9
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:02,340
And then we'll start with the first life stage, which is preconception.

10
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:08,800
Okay. These are just the learning objectives, basically. Same thing I said.

11
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:16,900
So first again, what I want to talk about are going to be these single nutrient recommendations.

12
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:22,030
But just thinking about the history of nutrients in general.

13
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:30,450
Before recommendations ever existed, we had to first just even understand that there were things in food or other words,

14
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:35,140
nutrients in food, and that they had some effect on our body.

15
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:40,329
And so the the Greek physician, Hippocrates is a property,

16
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:47,559
as I'm sure we've all heard of him even has this like famous sort of quote that has been passed along of saying

17
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:54,160
something along the lines that even eating in moderation is better for your body than overindulging or overeating.

18
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:03,430
So, right. So even way, way back then, we understood food had some sort of importance in our body.

19
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:10,330
And so what it consists of. Right. We have to start understanding what it consists of and what the value is of those things.

20
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:22,359
And so on this slide, what this is depicting is sort of a a famous observation that occurred in terms of the disease,

21
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:27,760
scurvy and the cure, figuring out the cure for that.

22
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:39,610
And so a lot of credit goes to who's depicted in this picture, which was James Lind here, did this epidemiological study with sailors.

23
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:45,940
And so the the background of this is that sailors would go out to sea with this limited food supply.

24
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:55,090
And then the majority of them, or about half of the sailors on each ship would start to develop these symptoms of scurvy.

25
00:02:55,090 --> 00:03:00,280
Which are these lesions on your skin, ulcerated, ulcerated or bleeding gums.

26
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:06,850
They would become very fatigued, lethargic, indicating an iron deficiency.

27
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:13,000
They'd come anemic. And so what this what James Linden is this very,

28
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:24,760
very simplified US epidemiological studies where he put pairs of sailors together and each of the paired sailors would eat different types of food.

29
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:31,060
And what they found was those sailors that ate lemons and oranges, which are high in vitamin C.

30
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:38,910
We're cured of these scurvy symptoms. And so this is not the first indication of this.

31
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:50,690
There's no reports like way back from the 1500s noting that fruits and vegetables were sort of like the cure of these symptoms as well.

32
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,440
Fruits and vegetables, a lot of them tend to be high in vitamin C as well.

33
00:03:55,530 --> 00:04:02,669
And so this is just one of these important observations that really gave us a clear indication that

34
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:08,700
there might be certain nutrients in certain foods that can help in terms of health or protect us,

35
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:12,110
you know, from from certain disease.

36
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:21,110
Okay. So again, the first thing I want to talk about today are these dietary recommendations.

37
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:25,880
So again, these are daily recommendations for single nutrients.

38
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,990
For I already said the daily recommendations.

39
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:41,450
Right. And so the first documented dietary recommendations from the government came in the 1800s.

40
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:49,610
But the purpose, you know, these have really evolved over the course of the past 100 plus years.

41
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:56,030
They were really first developed in order to prevent infectious disease.

42
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:00,860
So things like tuberculosis or polio.

43
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:08,510
Right. Are really, really a focus on that. They also first solely focused on macronutrients.

44
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:19,040
So those lipids, protein, carbohydrates, and simply just because we didn't have a lot of the knowledge about micronutrients.

45
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:26,350
So for example, folate, which is a B vitamin, and we're going to talk a lot about folate on Wednesday.

46
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:31,180
It's part of your case study this week that wasn't even discovered until 1931.

47
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:36,850
So it's just like this gap in knowledge we had in terms of, you know, what these recommendations focused on.

48
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:47,360
But what we see now in terms of dietary recommendations are called dietary reference intakes that were developed in the 1940s.

49
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:54,110
And these are still these daily recommendations for single nutrients.

50
00:05:54,920 --> 00:06:02,300
And the focus here is now more in terms of prevention of chronic disease rather than infectious disease.

51
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:09,980
Right. We have a lot of modernized medicine like vaccines that can really help in terms of prevention of infectious disease.

52
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:16,780
But the focus now is more on chronic disease. Right.

53
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:21,760
And this line has some repeating information from the last night, which is okay, repetition is okay.

54
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:31,330
But again, it's recommendations for energy and nutrients, micro macronutrients per day.

55
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:38,920
They accommodate ten different life stages, including some conditions that the human body can go through.

56
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:46,900
So pregnancy or lactation, for example, where nutritional values or nutritional needs are going to change.

57
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:55,639
And then they also accommodate female or male. And then the last part here again, I've already touched upon this,

58
00:06:55,640 --> 00:07:01,760
but the overall purpose of these recommendations is to prevent chronic disease, to prevent malnutrition.

59
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:08,990
So thinking both on both ends of the spectrum under nutritional deficiencies as well as excessive use of nutrients.

60
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:16,130
And then again supporting those altered nutritional needs, such as like lactation or pregnancy.

61
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:30,420
Okay. So dietary reference intakes, again, these are the set of recommendations that currently exist and dietary reference intake or DRI.

62
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:37,560
This is more like an umbrella term or a set of a few different recommendations that you can see on the slide.

63
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:45,150
And I'm sure a lot of you are familiar with some of these, like the RDA is actually probably the one you hear about the most.

64
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:55,020
But we're going to talk through each of these, starting with the recommendations on the left hand side of the slide.

65
00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:00,480
And then we'll talk about the energy intake recommendations really briefly as well.

66
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:14,460
All right. So the first one I will talk about is estimated average requirement or the EMR, and this meets the needs of large populations.

67
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:25,230
If a large group of people were to eat this recommendation, about 50% of the people in that group, it would meet the needs for them.

68
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:31,200
So I just want to go through a quick example here. I have 12 faces here.

69
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:35,160
Okay. So this represents 12,000 adult males.

70
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:44,010
Okay. So say all of these males are eating the same amount of calcium per day that are of calcium, which is 840 milligrams.

71
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:52,220
That means about 50% of them would be getting the amount that they need to meet their lifestyle,

72
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:59,270
their health needs, just their everyday life on their own to meet the needs of their own bodies.

73
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:05,160
Okay. All right.

74
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:13,649
So that's the E.R. and the RDA is probably the recommendation you might hear the most that you've ever sought.

75
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:19,470
Nutritional advice is this is what clinicians or health practitioners would tend to use.

76
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:28,410
And so it typically serves as a goal for the intake of individuals because it adds on a so-called safety factor to the EMR.

77
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:32,940
So if there is an EMR, you can calculate an RDA.

78
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:46,910
For a nutrient. Okay. So if an individual is taking in the RDA, the risk of deficiency is quite low for that individual.

79
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:54,740
Okay. So because of the safety factor, it meets the needs for needs for about 97% of the population.

80
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:19,830
The environment. I think it's more of like a genetic on what health conditions they might have, intensity of exercise, things like that.

81
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:29,670
Yeah. Oh, that's a really great question.

82
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:37,910
I think, you know, the in terms of the RDA, it's putting on that that safety factor, that standard deviation,

83
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:44,790
I think it's pretty, pretty well set for even kind of diverse populations as it diverse.

84
00:10:45,230 --> 00:11:01,040
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

85
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,210
I think I've thought about that a lot. Like, what's the point of the E.R.?

86
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:13,330
And when you read up on it, the E.R. is typically used in, like, larger population studies,

87
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:23,320
and it's mainly mainly used to sort of assess the the inadequacy of nutrient intake of the population.

88
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:30,950
So sort of assessing more on the end who might not be getting enough of this nutrient.

89
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:43,310
And so and so it's really just to get a sense of like who might be at risk for a deficiency adding on that safety factor,

90
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:51,740
it really is like a big safety factor. If you're meeting the RDA, it's a really safe amount in terms of your body being able to tolerate it,

91
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:56,780
process it effectively and really minimizing the risk of deficiency.

92
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:03,050
Does that help? Yeah. I think the E.R. I've struggled a lot, a lot with,

93
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:10,100
but I think it's mainly use just in terms of like really large population studies and if you're trying to figure out deficiencies.

94
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:19,400
Any other questions? So great questions.

95
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:26,350
Okay. The next one I want to talk about is the tolerable upper intake level.

96
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:33,160
So this one was actually added on the drugs that we use now with these different recommendations.

97
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:40,810
We're actually actually came from a major review by the Institute of Medicine in 1993,

98
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:46,510
and this type of recommendation was actually added on in that particular review.

99
00:12:47,680 --> 00:13:00,830
The upper the upper intake level, what it refers to is the most that of a nutrient that someone can take in per day that is tolerable to their body.

100
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:08,610
Biologically speaking. So it doesn't necessarily have any benefit to your body.

101
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:14,160
Right. It's just the highest amount someone could take in and their body could process.

102
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,310
Their body could tolerate it. So that word tolerable was really used intentionally.

103
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:30,760
Okay. So we think of the U. L when we're thinking about like supplementation or enrichment or fortification of food products.

104
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:42,020
Okay. And then the adequate intake level. This is one I'm going to put an example to.

105
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:48,919
So bear with me. Hopefully I can talk through this pretty smoothly so you can get adjust for for what it

106
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:57,620
means on the adequate intake level is set when we can't set an EMR and then that's an RDA.

107
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:03,950
So adequate intake level is set when perhaps the scientific information or data that we

108
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:15,080
have on it is really mixed or for some reason people's people really tolerate or process.

109
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:23,700
Nutrients very differently. And so the example I want to put to this is Colon.

110
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:31,559
So calling us a B vitamin and we actually know a lot about codeine.

111
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:41,460
We know why we need it in our body. First, choline is really important for brain development, but also brain maintenance over time.

112
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:49,090
Okay. The other thing that's really important and sort of hang on to this idea for a little

113
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:54,970
bit is that Colleen is part of the transporter that transports fats out of the liver.

114
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:55,950
Right.

115
00:14:56,370 --> 00:15:05,460
So if we don't have enough choline, that transporter can't work properly and fat can start to build up in the liver causing fatty liver disease.

116
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:15,750
Okay. So the adequate intake level of choline was set by observing healthy individuals

117
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:21,600
and seeing how much they were taking in of choline to prevent fatty liver disease.

118
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:33,630
Right. So taking in enough choline to make sure that the transportation of fat out of the liver was working properly.

119
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:44,080
Okay. So actually I need to back up a little bit. The reason why we set an adequate intake level for Colleen instead of setting an R

120
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:51,970
is because choline is actually a vitamin in our body that we can bias synthesize,

121
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:57,850
meaning that we can actually make Colleen ourselves right rather than eating it from the diet.

122
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:06,350
The thing is, is that some people can bio synthesize a whole lot of polling and that would mean very little from the diet.

123
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:14,770
Versus we all have these slight genetic variances where some of us can't make a whole lot of choline in our body.

124
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:18,390
And so then we would need to eat more from the diet. Right.

125
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:26,590
So that makes it very hard to study air when individual differences of the need for cooling through the diet can vary so much.

126
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:31,080
Okay. So then moving forward,

127
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:35,940
the way that we set the adequate intake level was through this observation of the

128
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:41,970
healthy people and how much they were taking in to prevent that fatty liver disease.

129
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:48,530
Okay. Does that make sense? I'm sorry. I kind of flip flop there.

130
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,940
Forgot to say that. Questions.

131
00:16:56,290 --> 00:17:04,600
Okay. And there's other vitamins and like trace minerals that we also have adequate intake for.

132
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:14,560
An example is vitamin D that has a lot to do with exposure to sunlight because we can synthesize vitamin D through UVB rays.

133
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,590
So just think about different regions that people live in,

134
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:24,670
different skin tones that can affect the synthesis of vitamin D in our body, things like that.

135
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:38,280
Yeah. I think I know what you're getting at.

136
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:43,409
And actually, I was I was just reading about this, and it's just correct me if I'm wrong,

137
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:49,550
but are you thinking of like the RDA that would meet the needs of like 97% of the population?

138
00:17:51,060 --> 00:18:00,300
The the adequate intake lies somewhere between the E.R. and the RDA in terms of meeting the needs of the population.

139
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:05,780
Is that right? Yeah. Okay. Yes.

140
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:15,810
So if someone's taken the like we have that population of people and they were all taking in the eye,

141
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:22,020
it would meet, you know, somewhere between 50 to 100% of the population.

142
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,710
Okay. Great questions, guys. Thank you. Okay.

143
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:41,460
I'm. The other thing I don't think I said, but in terms of the dietary reference intakes overall,

144
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:51,600
there's recommendations set for 40 nutrients and it also includes nontraditional nutrients like phytochemicals.

145
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:59,989
And that was something in terms of the most new, recently published set of Dry Eyes.

146
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:03,140
That's something new that that came out of those publications.

147
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:13,560
Okay. So next what I want to do is briefly talk about energy intake recommendations, starting with the estimated energy requirement or EPR.

148
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:23,830
And so I just want to ask you guys. In terms of just, you know, you being you looking at the people around you.

149
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:29,020
We all require a different amount of calories per day or energy per day.

150
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:34,440
What are some reasons for that? Yeah.

151
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:39,120
I guess it's like your age could affect your thinking.

152
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:44,390
Your age? Yeah. Absolutely activity levels.

153
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:53,400
The difference is that what you're in? Anything else?

154
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:58,440
Any other ideas? I feel trapped back here. Yup.

155
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:05,470
Absolutely what type of environment you live in. How does that affect your daily life?

156
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:09,960
Yeah. Absolutely. You're Muslim. That's your body composition.

157
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:14,960
Okay. Thank you, guys. Those are all great answers. This is what I have here.

158
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,940
Just some, you know, basic reason factors, right.

159
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:23,220
That affect energy needs on a daily basis.

160
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:26,690
Right. And could included growth and development.

161
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:35,280
Right. Because when you're growing and developing and we'll talk a lot about this year in terms of your body size, your energy needs are quite high.

162
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:49,300
Okay. So the estimated energy requirement is what health practitioners will use when you really need to calculate specific needs for an individual.

163
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,670
It really is a drawn out equation.

164
00:20:54,670 --> 00:21:02,860
If you look at the absolute full equation of it, that includes different types of metabolism like thermic thermic effect of food.

165
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:10,930
Right. That's just the energy it takes when we just to digest and absorb our food basal metabolic rate.

166
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:15,790
So just thinking about the energy it takes just to be sitting here and existing.

167
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:26,530
And then it also takes into account energy deposition. So things that you guys all brought up like age, your body composition,

168
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:33,370
physical activity levels and then the air can also take into consideration those

169
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:41,559
additional needs for energy and nutrients like when during lactation or pregnancy.

170
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:47,070
So things like that, those different types of conditions. So I'm not going to go through this equation.

171
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:50,110
I just want you to know the purpose of it.

172
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:55,509
I included a link in on this slide that you can open up and you can just see some

173
00:21:55,510 --> 00:22:00,700
examples of different equations for different age groups and things like that.

174
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:12,180
Okay. The last one I want to go through is the acceptable macronutrient distribution range or the MDR.

175
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,200
And this is really just a sort of a broad,

176
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:22,640
interpretive interpretation of the percent of calories that should come from each of those macronutrients per day.

177
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,610
And so if you stay in this range.

178
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:37,710
The thought is that you will be able to meet your micronutrient requirements as well and helps to prevent chronic disease.

179
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:46,290
And so when you go through the life stages, this is technically the EMDR is typically what I'll be referring to.

180
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:54,170
So like in infants, we'll talk about their percentage of calories coming from fat.

181
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:57,839
We want it to be like on the higher end, for example.

182
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:03,560
So we'll talk about things like that. Any questions?

183
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:07,800
I am going to switch gears to the American Dietary Guidelines for Americans.

184
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:28,009
The Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Yeah.

185
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:35,780
So the Institute of Medicine is the one that will form committees to review and set these guidelines.

186
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:41,500
And it really is they're really set from scientific data on that.

187
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:59,550
So they're. Yep. They're not basing it off of the MDR.

188
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:06,290
The food labels are a little tricky, and I might have to look this up.

189
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:13,370
The food labels are actually based on something completely different from the years it gets called.

190
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:20,390
Actually even might have these lists in my notes. Maybe I don't.

191
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:28,820
Do you think of something called like the RG A's? And I'm not sure I can tell you what that stands for, but the food labels are a little trickier.

192
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:32,660
I think that could probably pull that up and find some information on there.

193
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:42,290
But the the food labels also take guidance from the dietary guidelines for Americans that we'll talk about now.

194
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:47,370
I mean, I can give you an example once we get. Okay.

195
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:52,940
Any other questions? All right.

196
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:56,190
Thank you, guys, for all the questions. It's good. Okay.

197
00:24:56,340 --> 00:25:00,629
Dietary guidelines for Americans. This is what we're going to talk about next.

198
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:05,910
And so this is different from these single nutrient recommendations that we just just talked about.

199
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:16,420
These are more broader guidelines to really be used to promote health, promote a healthy diet overall.

200
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:25,890
And these are guidelines that are reviewed every five years by the USDA.

201
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:31,740
So the last review was done in 2020.

202
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:36,800
The current guidelines that we have now were published in January 2021.

203
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:45,850
And again it's sort of the same thing there other it's this the like the 2020 review was a review

204
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:52,120
of the current medical and nutrition research because we know it's really super fast paced.

205
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:58,870
And so the guidelines of the dietary guidelines for Americans are goals are laid out

206
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:05,589
on the slide similar to the dietary recommendations or the nutrient recommendations,

207
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:11,530
right, to promote health, prevent chronic disease. And then there's really.

208
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:20,110
Just a plethora of tools or resources that health practitioners or public health

209
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:29,710
agencies or teachers instructors can use in terms of educating people on health,

210
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:34,900
healthy eating, and, you know, to live just like a healthy lifestyle.

211
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:40,920
I'm currently this sort of have this main icon here.

212
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:46,440
It's used as like a nutritional guide in terms of.

213
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:53,460
You know, helping people making healthy food choices or dietary choices.

214
00:26:53,820 --> 00:27:00,570
So the current icon is called My Plate, and you can see here what it represents.

215
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:02,820
And I'll blow this up in a couple of slides.

216
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:11,100
But it represents looking at the at each meal, the different proportions of food groups that one should take in.

217
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,510
And this my plate again, I'll show you in a few slides.

218
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:25,830
But it's really been adapted for the use as a resource to educate different populations and age groups and things like that.

219
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:32,959
And then I put up these other these older icons or nutritional guides on the food pyramids.

220
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:39,860
People still use these, especially the one over here, because it's been one that's really easy to follow.

221
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:43,700
But just in case you guys are familiar, those sort of ring a bell as well.

222
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:56,870
Okay. So this slide has the four published currently published guidelines and I don't have them written out in full.

223
00:27:56,870 --> 00:28:03,230
You can Google the guidelines and you can find the full on reports of these guidelines and why they came up with them.

224
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:12,660
But from this past most recent review in 2020, there are a couple of new things that they really wanted to focus on.

225
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:18,380
On the first one, it says, follow a healthy dietary pattern at every life stage.

226
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:25,820
So this is actually new. Previous guidelines that were published only had guidelines targeted for children and above.

227
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:33,050
So they added in these guidelines the life stages of infancy and toddlers.

228
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:44,360
The second one is also really important in terms of customizing, especially for health educators or practitioners,

229
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:55,160
customizing personalized food choices, taking in cultural into mind, cultural preferences and traditions and budgetary considerations.

230
00:28:56,210 --> 00:29:07,490
This one is really important just in terms of the the availability of certain resources for different cultures or populations.

231
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:17,840
There's also been a lot of like call to action for dietitians or other health practitioners to really start.

232
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:26,610
To keep taking into consideration how to educate people from different cultures.

233
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:36,360
The way that dietitians are trained is like, you know, you eat a baked chicken breast and some green beans and a whole green piece of bread.

234
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,759
And, you know, that's what you need to teach your clients.

235
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:46,200
And we all know that is not going to meet the needs for, you know, the majority of our population these days.

236
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:53,640
There's a really good New York Times article that I'll share with you all through a canvass announcement that really put out

237
00:29:53,640 --> 00:30:05,310
a call to action to this for a lot of the different Dietetic Association or Diet Dietetic training programs in terms of,

238
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:10,710
you know, we really need to be aware of this in terms of our education and education materials.

239
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:18,630
These last or the third one is really focusing sort of on like overall diets.

240
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,300
We all don't eat the same thing on a daily basis.

241
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:29,620
So just making sure over time what we take in sort of meets the needs of what's considered to be a healthy diet.

242
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:36,100
And then the last one is the only time in the guidelines that you'll see where

243
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:41,829
there's sort of like a quantification of meeting certain dietary requirements.

244
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:49,540
So for example, like what we see on the food label, when you see such a saturated fatty acids,

245
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:54,100
you know, that's put on there because the dietary guidelines,

246
00:30:54,260 --> 00:31:04,900
a recommendation that's been published over and over and over again, is that less than 10% of your calories should come from saturated fatty acids.

247
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:12,050
Okay. So again, this is just a snippet of what they are.

248
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:18,810
If you're interested, you can you know, you can look them up. Okay.

249
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:31,600
In terms of. In terms of the history of dietary guidelines, again, they sort of started coming around in the late 1800s,

250
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:36,580
early 1900s, and again, a really a big focus on infectious disease.

251
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:44,080
And you'll see over time that they weren't always about promoting health.

252
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:50,230
A lot of times they just had to do with that priority of whatever was going on in the country at that time.

253
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:57,460
So like in the 1900s, really focusing on children and thinking about infectious disease.

254
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:03,160
So the mortality rate, around 1900 of children under five was like 40%.

255
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:09,530
So just thinking about that. As we move on in the 1900s, we're in wartime.

256
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:13,150
The guidelines really were all about rationing food.

257
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:19,000
So, you know, don't waste food. Don't throw it away. Eat whatever is on your plate, whatever is cooked.

258
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:26,460
As we move on in time, you start to see different food groups come to light like fruits, vegetables, whole grains.

259
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:34,410
Then we started to relate guidelines to health outcomes like more in terms of chronic disease.

260
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:41,080
And then we started to see some of these quantification of nutrient recommendations like that,

261
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:45,160
less than 10% of your calories coming from saturated fat.

262
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:51,420
So that's just a little history. I think it's really interesting.

263
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:58,230
And then just coming back to the my plates again, it's a nutrition guide just used by different,

264
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:03,720
you know, public health professionals, our nutrition professionals, health professionals in general.

265
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:09,150
And just looking at it, you can see, you know, really what it stands for,

266
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:16,440
these different food groups and different proportions per meal, sort of like what a typical meal should look like.

267
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:27,200
And then, yeah, the next slide, this is where we see it's adapted to different populations, different age groups.

268
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:33,860
So for example, this is a pregnant person and it's translated to Spanish.

269
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:40,220
This one is showing what a breakfast could look like for a school aged child.

270
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:44,630
This is one of my favorites. This my plate for older adults.

271
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:51,020
We'll come back to it and talk through it in way at the end of the semester when we talk about geriatrics.

272
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:58,790
But you can really see it's adapted for, you know, the changes that occur in the older adult population.

273
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:03,349
So one thing is that their thirst sensation really diminishes.

274
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:07,309
So sometimes they don't know they're thirsty, even though they should be drinking liquids.

275
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:11,720
So, you know, see, there's a big emphasis on different ways to get your liquids in per day.

276
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:14,500
Right. So just some examples.

277
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:21,490
You can go to this choose my plate dot gov and you can find just a whole bunch of different resources for your resources.

278
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:29,470
Any questions? Oh, yeah.

279
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:34,760
Yeah. That's going to touch on the food label. The food labels are.

280
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:46,230
So they're listed in percent daily value. So how much of a nutrient in that particular food would you need the daily value of an individual.

281
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:57,190
Those daily values are set from the RDA or the AIS, depending on what information is available to the various index funds.

282
00:34:57,190 --> 00:35:05,110
They might not be available for certain nutrients and they're based on a 2000 calorie diet reference.

283
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:09,990
I just assume that you. You're consuming 2000 calories a day.

284
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:18,270
And then for people over the age of four, and it takes into consideration if you're pregnant or lactating.

285
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:24,240
And then, yeah, just as long as you're above the age of four. So it's not like.

286
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:32,190
All right. Thank you. All right. Any other questions or comments?

287
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:40,780
Okay. The last thing I want to do today is talk.

288
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:44,110
Just start talking about pre-conception nutrition.

289
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:49,180
These are all of the learning objectives. We'll get through most of them on Wednesday.

290
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:56,470
Today, I just want to start thinking about how nutrition could possibly impact fertility levels.

291
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:06,780
Okay. So pre-conception. So what this means is that individuals are at a time where they're of reproductive age.

292
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:14,040
And so in terms of fertility, the ability to conceive, for example,

293
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:20,400
what are some different factors that could affect fertility status in an individual?

294
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,010
Yeah. Yeah.

295
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:33,790
So I'm very in genetics, which could just affect like the reproductive tract in general.

296
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:38,560
I'm thinking back to last week's case study of environmental exposures.

297
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:47,360
There's lots of solid evidence now showing that that can affect the functioning of reproductive organs.

298
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:52,340
What are the different types of plastics or things like that? Yeah.

299
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:58,540
Age. Absolutely. And we'll we'll actually touch upon age, not pre-conception,

300
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:06,760
but more in the pregnancy lecture in terms of both younger individuals and older individuals.

301
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:12,800
Any other ideas? I think we.

302
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:16,350
Oh, yeah. Permanent status.

303
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:20,170
Yeah, absolutely. And so thank you.

304
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:29,930
So these are I think we touched upon all of these. The hormone goes along the lines of the functioning of reproductive organs, for example.

305
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:34,900
But yeah, these are all things to think about in terms of fertility status.

306
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:43,390
And well, we're going to try really to focus on be sort of this last one here, like nutrition status or diet.

307
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:48,390
This slide is just showing some definitions to be familiar with.

308
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:58,320
The first one is fertility. When we talk about the term fertility, that's actually referring to an actual child being born.

309
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:03,090
Right. So someone is pregnant and they do give birth to a child.

310
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:12,570
That's fertility versus fecundity is just an individual and their biological capacity to conceive.

311
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:16,760
So, okay, so there is a little bit of a difference there.

312
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:20,400
They're usually used interchangeably.

313
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:27,780
So for the purposes of just some of the readings we we go through and things like that, we'll just use fertility.

314
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,310
Infertility is when some.

315
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:37,110
Yeah. The other. Yeah.

316
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:43,650
Fecundity is just the biological capacity to be able to bear child or.

317
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:57,700
Okay. Yeah. Sorry. Is that also. Yes.

318
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:01,520
So I think that would fall under. Fertility.

319
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:08,280
I'm not absolutely sure. Do you want to stop? It doesn't really matter in the context of this class.

320
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:14,890
But just for specifics. I think it would if it's carried out until until that time for.

321
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:24,350
Okay. So infertility if you if an individual into two individuals I suppose,

322
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:32,180
or an individual is actively trying to conceive for a year or longer, they're then considered infertile.

323
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:40,849
And you can see the proportion of the US population that is considered infertile and then

324
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:46,850
sub fertility is more of a generalized term of just having difficulties conceiving.

325
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:55,330
So fertility, you will see this term used in relation to like different chronic disease that might make it more difficult to conceive.

326
00:39:57,570 --> 00:40:03,930
And then just this last statement here, we'll start thinking about how nutrition can impact the level of fertility.

327
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:15,500
Okay. So we've already talked a lot about factors that could potentially affect fertility,

328
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:24,350
but it really comes down to having in some way abnormal hormone reproductive hormone production.

329
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:28,940
So we can think of the reproductive tract and all the organs that go along with that.

330
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:34,820
If they are malfunctioning in some way, that could affect the hormone balance.

331
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:43,010
And adipose tissue is actually considered what we call an endocrine tissue, meaning that it can affect hormone status in our body.

332
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:51,020
So actually excess adipose tissue can have an effect on estrogen levels in our body.

333
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:56,010
We'll talk a lot about that. I'm thinking about body protein synthesis.

334
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:59,670
A body protein in our bodies is a hormone.

335
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:06,840
So just making sure we have all the appropriate amino acids to be able to build these hormone, these hormones.

336
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:21,160
And then if there's a hormone imbalance, what we start to see or what we can measure is abnormal menstrual cycles or absence of ovulation.

337
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,930
Ovulation is the time when the egg is released.

338
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:32,020
And it can also affect sperm production or integrity of the sperm.

339
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:40,110
Okay, so on or so.

340
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:46,950
Nutrition is important because it can support just that hormone production in our body.

341
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:52,830
Just thinking about that amino acid pool, I know I've already said this.

342
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:56,110
And then also nutrition in terms, you know,

343
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:03,270
if there's excess adipose tissue that can affect hormone levels and then just thinking about the

344
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:09,480
health of the cells in our body and the health of the functioning of our of our reproductive tract.

345
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:19,860
Okay. The next couple of slides are just reference slides by no means have to memorize these.

346
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:29,070
I just want to give examples of common reproductive hormones that we'll be referring to quite a bit.

347
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:36,710
So like when I say gender age, just so you are sort of familiar with, you know,

348
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:41,230
what that is, it's a reproductive hormone and then some of their functions.

349
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:52,020
Again, no need to memorize this. Just be familiar that these are names of reproductive hormones and like FH LH that's how we abbreviate them.

350
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:59,190
And then the menstrual cycle in a female body.

351
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:08,860
So just being familiar with these different hormones and you can just see from this this picture the fluctuations in terms of these hormones.

352
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:10,479
Keeping in mind, again,

353
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:20,680
that the these the production of these is really important and being able to keep up with these fluctuations is important for ovulation to occur,

354
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:21,880
things like that.

355
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:33,750
And then again, this is just different hormones in the male body that we would we would be bringing up throughout some of these life stages.

356
00:43:36,850 --> 00:43:39,940
Okay. So that's all I have this week.

357
00:43:40,090 --> 00:43:50,020
Ah, today. Sorry. So I have for today. There is a case study due on Thursday morning and it has a lot to do with four lates.

358
00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:53,890
I think you can get through most of it's on your own,

359
00:43:53,890 --> 00:43:59,890
but Wednesday does have some information in the lecture that will help you complete it and I'll

360
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:04,719
try to get the slides up in the next couple of hours because you can like sift through it,

361
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:11,500
maybe you can find some of the answers there. And then just the second weekly participation is posted on campus.

362
00:44:11,830 --> 00:44:15,820
So you can look at that as well. Thank you, everyone.
