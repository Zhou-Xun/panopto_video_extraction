1
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:18,340
okay.

2
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:24,080
alright. we're gonna start. we're we're gonna start on Richard it's me right now.

3
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,980
okay we're gonna get started

4
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:35,140
pretty. I'm gonna introduce Professor Jake and Mora. you live

5
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:40,140
coming to the guy or some smart

6
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:45,260
program from Tasha.

7
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:51,300
where come up. okay

8
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:56,800
to Jake Brad. you are in need of medical degree and masters degree

9
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,937
in health sciences. you've been very University where are you sorry

10
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:07,577
early. Elliot has Susan professor at the Department of Management.

11
00:01:07,577 --> 00:01:13,037
the medical doctor he specializes something on my mobile the consultant

12
00:01:13,037 --> 00:01:18,517
Public Health Medicine. Cindy only. this is an initial. she's a strange customer

13
00:01:18,517 --> 00:01:24,157
relations and he's really government sector that whole ministration

14
00:01:24,157 --> 00:01:29,297
and research and development. Mike. Mike about microbiology

15
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:35,157
Corporation and the National Michael about you. oh. he's really ministry

16
00:01:35,157 --> 00:01:42,097
is focusing on national strategy and policy making public health microbiology.

17
00:01:42,097 --> 00:01:47,357
he's also involved in an emergency preparedness in response. as a member of the National visor committee

18
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:52,437
and for our Chris Management. during a public health emergency. the two

19
00:01:52,437 --> 00:01:59,669
thousand thirteen well. all you sent them today alright

20
00:01:59,669 --> 00:02:07,809
the international customer on the line for chairperson.

21
00:02:07,809 --> 00:02:12,909
Diana. remember open for. yeah yeah. yeah you said

22
00:02:12,909 --> 00:02:19,009
you know I'm sessions from Mike balaji and Charity International working group for the holding

23
00:02:19,009 --> 00:02:24,269
in the voicemail message to answer

24
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:29,789
your survey. Joe. call me. bye.

25
00:02:29,789 --> 00:02:36,409
here's what and check Rob. hey George.

26
00:02:36,409 --> 00:02:41,769
hey thank you very much and good morning to you. I apologize

27
00:02:41,769 --> 00:02:47,789
for not being able to participate in person because I just came back from the US last night.

28
00:02:47,789 --> 00:02:52,829
but I'm logically still on US time so I'm closer to

29
00:02:52,829 --> 00:02:57,949
anything. so the my boys. so sure talk to you. this

30
00:02:57,949 --> 00:03:03,001
is about Michael build you know Mason. hello. this could be harness in

31
00:03:03,001 --> 00:03:08,001
for your policy. this is this is my main interest both as

32
00:03:08,001 --> 00:03:23,581
an academic.

33
00:03:23,581 --> 00:03:28,601
also as a parent leader we need to others. sorry we lost you.

34
00:03:28,601 --> 00:03:34,961
we need to understand better. can you hear me now.

35
00:03:34,961 --> 00:03:40,861
if you get a free show. you might be there.

36
00:03:40,861 --> 00:03:46,221
okay I can do that.

37
00:03:46,221 --> 00:03:51,541
so as you're aware there are quite a few challenges in in the fax is this is in critical

38
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:58,137
microbiology. these days when you do get diagnostics you in time or Google drugs

39
00:03:58,137 --> 00:04:03,217
and then you tools. in order to understand. give me

40
00:04:03,217 --> 00:04:08,717
and then do straight tracking. and of course the business of resistance. and hopefully

41
00:04:08,717 --> 00:04:13,917
the new LG is is quite disturbing. so what we are interested in

42
00:04:13,917 --> 00:04:20,457
is is in the harness thing that you know makes those old and you mix technology.

43
00:04:20,457 --> 00:04:25,777
now inform Michael Ball people diagnosis. to see how those translating

44
00:04:25,777 --> 00:04:30,917
to public health actions. this demand could be. this trip

45
00:04:30,917 --> 00:04:36,137
divided into four main topics. the first being hold you know Michael

46
00:04:36,137 --> 00:04:41,297
will sequencing and with that. we're sick seeing a complete

47
00:04:41,297 --> 00:04:46,337
Gina off back. usually a priority messages for

48
00:04:46,337 --> 00:04:51,417
Bobby Shell with the intention of trying to extract from the Jean on

49
00:04:51,417 --> 00:04:56,629
all the relevant information that could be done translated into Bobby Joe faction

50
00:04:56,629 --> 00:05:01,749
the second topic is studies of the Michael by home. I don't think I need to elaborate

51
00:05:01,749 --> 00:05:06,849
any further on the importance of you Michael by all means health and disease. but we

52
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:11,929
also very interested in in being of our mental Michael bio and danger blade between Denver mental

53
00:05:11,929 --> 00:05:17,229
and human Michael by different populations. then the third topic

54
00:05:17,229 --> 00:05:24,449
is a message and I'll make sense and this is really an emergency feel now in in clinical Michael biology

55
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:29,869
testing. all Central samples are in for my samples.

56
00:05:29,869 --> 00:05:35,249
in order to look at the charge and only content of samples

57
00:05:35,249 --> 00:05:40,849
and of course very many

58
00:05:40,849 --> 00:05:45,989
cross cutting issues relating to the integration of those technologies

59
00:05:45,989 --> 00:05:51,229
in in Public Health and clinical microbiology. including all the economical

60
00:05:51,229 --> 00:05:57,543
factors related factors operational factors and so forth

61
00:05:57,543 --> 00:06:02,643
so just really straight on the left inside you can see the difficult work flow. also

62
00:06:02,643 --> 00:06:09,223
traditional Michael in which we do the processing of samples. we grow bacteria

63
00:06:09,223 --> 00:06:14,483
in culture and then we do a range of off test. usually in tandem

64
00:06:14,483 --> 00:06:19,603
and open parallel. in order to identify the species.

65
00:06:19,603 --> 00:06:24,743
perhaps doing some stuff typing soon like to serve who been

66
00:06:24,743 --> 00:06:29,923
performing and primary focus of the ability testing and then some additional testing.

67
00:06:29,923 --> 00:06:35,043
using Barry Senator Dick and Jen if you get a space. in order to establish. they

68
00:06:35,043 --> 00:06:40,079
will then send to City and finally doing typing using either of

69
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:45,559
you and I figure breaking or Melissa Steve multi local assistance typing.

70
00:06:45,559 --> 00:06:50,619
in order to do the in the LG and string tracking. so the

71
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:55,879
parallel to that. you know sequencing there is extracting

72
00:06:55,879 --> 00:07:03,599
DNA sequencing being tired you know and Danny doing gold

73
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:08,779
in for legal. so all of the West lab. and of course

74
00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:14,419
do those in parallel in high troop and it with much greater

75
00:07:14,419 --> 00:07:19,779
resolution. and and that way we're able to quickly establish the rest

76
00:07:19,779 --> 00:07:25,079
in the real loan. so be in RG content that is relevant to resistance and to

77
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:30,139
disease and of course have maximum communication nation. in terms

78
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:35,452
of doing a brief investigation with message and I'll make

79
00:07:35,452 --> 00:07:40,792
this will bring us to on by and Independent culture and get Ben and Michael biology

80
00:07:40,792 --> 00:07:45,972
so not having given to grove the box. but just sequencing directly clinical

81
00:07:45,972 --> 00:07:52,712
or a very memorable samples and trying to reach fair. all those

82
00:07:52,712 --> 00:07:58,292
things that I just mentioned. so just to briefly illustrate because really I don't have

83
00:07:58,292 --> 00:08:03,292
too much time to elaborate but one of the boards that we're investigating

84
00:08:03,292 --> 00:08:08,392
is Barker which as you know it's be probably still problems in terms of

85
00:08:08,392 --> 00:08:14,392
resistance and hopefully the Aldrich. so we set up from ethics pipeline to

86
00:08:14,392 --> 00:08:25,052
study I need to factor and using this pipeline. sorry.

87
00:08:25,052 --> 00:08:30,612
also using this this comp additional infrastructure. we are able

88
00:08:30,612 --> 00:08:35,748
to actually define the exact species press any director which is

89
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:41,208
very difficult to perform. now they've in there with the lab. we can also use various

90
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:46,368
strategies. in order to identify resistance jeans and we do that

91
00:08:46,368 --> 00:08:52,268
quite often. and Lucy dating. the reason resistant mechanism is that

92
00:08:52,268 --> 00:08:57,708
we have with us in need of actor. we also tried to correlate

93
00:08:57,708 --> 00:09:04,008
General Doctor Seneca. we recently did a study in which we compared

94
00:09:04,008 --> 00:09:09,568
patients with fatal infection and non- facial infection and identify

95
00:09:09,568 --> 00:09:14,728
various jeans in specifically the ages of fact I need a doctor which

96
00:09:14,728 --> 00:09:20,688
we're associated with worst patient out

97
00:09:20,688 --> 00:09:25,708
and then finally we've also set up new schemes that allowed

98
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:30,888
to investigate. Hope the dog breaks. question is about the Obama night in much

99
00:09:30,888 --> 00:09:36,422
bigger resolution then the existing scheme so this is just really

100
00:09:36,422 --> 00:09:41,882
snap shot of what we do. so the added value. faster

101
00:09:41,882 --> 00:09:47,622
secrecy for Bobby Joe. Ross is really having the maximum resolution

102
00:09:47,622 --> 00:09:52,742
for doing the follow general analysis. and this is forms

103
00:09:52,742 --> 00:09:58,482
are of our capability. just trying tracking to investigate all the breaks

104
00:09:58,482 --> 00:10:03,922
and also see to understand the transition dynamics of different bacterial

105
00:10:03,922 --> 00:10:11,882
public self importance. so forth.

106
00:10:11,882 --> 00:10:17,422
and we believe that in the near future. also was to identifying your diagnostic

107
00:10:17,422 --> 00:10:22,662
and therapeutic target. I do apologize for. move our risk

108
00:10:22,662 --> 00:10:28,262
assessment risk management.

109
00:10:28,262 --> 00:10:34,610
so just lawyer. eventually every

110
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:39,810
you wanna know on the

111
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:45,350
menu and

112
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:50,490
translate. all research tree for Public Health.

113
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:55,650
and we plan to look on several avenues. the Michael buying human

114
00:10:55,650 --> 00:11:00,970
environment. the dynamics of fame or transmission. special focus

115
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:15,110
on food and water board infections which is of interest committee members were

116
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:20,370
in public of microbiology. and we're also interested in collaborating

117
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:25,370
on the course testing barriers ration of choosing. Bishop

118
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:32,370
Michael biology such as regulation economics and

119
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:42,696
so I saw your this is.

120
00:11:42,696 --> 00:11:50,296
thank you. questions call me.

121
00:11:50,296 --> 00:11:55,356
call me. this is Jerry. hi this is Al. thank you so

122
00:11:55,356 --> 00:12:00,856
much. hey. hey just leaving right.

123
00:12:00,856 --> 00:12:06,096
okay. imagine it but I think maybe the connection

124
00:12:06,096 --> 00:12:12,956
between yielding it's happening. Lilly

125
00:12:12,956 --> 00:12:18,176
says it's a very good point. so we we really live in a very

126
00:12:18,176 --> 00:12:23,236
unique sending and and we have part. will joined

127
00:12:23,236 --> 00:12:31,496
up system. with several key players in the region. so

128
00:12:31,496 --> 00:12:36,956
and then we have a range of researchers in in our faculty there

129
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:42,896
links with studies of Public Health. actually Jesus.

130
00:12:42,896 --> 00:12:49,096
then we have our our university or Philly Medical_Center Sue Rocha.

131
00:12:49,096 --> 00:12:54,596
and we have very good links. also with the microbiology stroke

132
00:12:54,596 --> 00:12:59,596
and so in terms of research this stuff straightened and being able

133
00:12:59,596 --> 00:13:04,716
to reprint patients for observation studies and so

134
00:13:04,716 --> 00:13:09,916
forth. I think we're very vote will place to deliver

135
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:16,136
studies that also involved in the clinical part and we also have our regional

136
00:13:16,136 --> 00:13:21,516
or District Health Office. Mister Phil which oversees

137
00:13:21,516 --> 00:13:26,756
or gonna be probably testing. government

138
00:13:26,756 --> 00:13:32,136
travel and many of the people in. this is Joe

139
00:13:32,136 --> 00:13:37,196
calling faculty in our department. so this

140
00:13:37,196 --> 00:13:42,216
is really a very strong in existing network of people

141
00:13:42,216 --> 00:13:47,396
who really love to to work together difficult to fix his diseases. and this

142
00:13:47,396 --> 00:13:53,236
could be a very good platform to deliver a range of studies.

143
00:13:53,236 --> 00:14:01,656
I just spoke to you had

144
00:14:01,656 --> 00:14:10,456
spoken we're probably down.

145
00:14:10,456 --> 00:14:15,721
call me actually call and talk about Irene. so when you go out there

146
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:24,001
hello. hello.

147
00:14:24,001 --> 00:14:31,061
hello. hello. hello.

148
00:14:31,061 --> 00:14:36,081
Alison everything else. Kristen

149
00:14:36,081 --> 00:14:42,801
France Mallory.

150
00:14:42,801 --> 00:14:52,781
call when you

151
00:14:52,781 --> 00:14:58,401
get a chance. tell you our situation in

152
00:14:58,401 --> 00:15:03,521
our. four door need. here's

153
00:15:03,521 --> 00:15:10,401
the run.

154
00:15:10,401 --> 00:15:16,381
I love you.

155
00:15:16,381 --> 00:15:21,431
