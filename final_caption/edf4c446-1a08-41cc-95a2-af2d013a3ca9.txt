1
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:06,320
Ah. Thank you. Such a quiet group, guys.

2
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:11,020
What's up with you? Okay. Really good. Yeah.

3
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:15,650
What is the Thursday? Tuesday is fall break.

4
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:18,979
All right, so just reminder, the problem set.

5
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:29,330
One is due on next Thursday. I opened up the assignment so you can just deposit here on canvas until 11:59 p.m. on the 20th.

6
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:38,330
Let me know if that's a problem as it approaches. Otherwise, I assume everyone's in good shape on that.

7
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:43,940
I think we've covered most things you'll need to to finish it right now.

8
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:48,890
So take a look if you at it, please, because there's a lot of questions.

9
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:55,340
Any other questions on the calendar? Before we get started.

10
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,400
We're getting there. This is the halfway point officially, and we'll see the lecture.

11
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:11,210
Heavy stuff will kind of start to slow down after we get through the second to second unit and we get more to like the group projects.

12
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:18,980
I know it's kind of a lot of heavy slog here in the middle with some dense material, but we're getting there.

13
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:26,230
Okay. There's no further questions.

14
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:32,660
I guess we'll you get started. So.

15
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:45,229
Okay. Last time we talked about properties of aerosols, but if you remember before that, we had a brief lecture on the properties of gas and vapors,

16
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:53,090
which again gives us some things, some ideas going in on what we need to know as far as hazard how to sample,

17
00:01:53,090 --> 00:02:01,070
whether there's a hazard, things like that. So now we're going to build on that and go into more detail on how we go about sampling for those,

18
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:07,070
because that's going to differ from how we sample for aerosols, which is based on a lot of differences we've been talking about.

19
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:13,520
So for today, looking at an understanding of airborne contaminant behavior and the impact on sampling,

20
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:21,139
then some methods available commonly used for sampling gas gases and vapors,

21
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:26,810
and then understanding some of the operating principles and strengths limitations of those various methods.

22
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,079
Today, I also, before we get to gas,

23
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:38,960
is a bit specifically we talk a little bit more about some fundamentals of equipment and things used commonly for this type of effort.

24
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:46,790
So if you recall back to a few lectures ago when we talked about the introduction to industrial hygiene and occupational hygiene,

25
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:51,319
we had the step three in that process where we're always we're actually talking

26
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:56,930
about quantitatively assessing risk and whether there's a hazard present.

27
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:02,299
So there was a lot there, but we're going to focus on designing the sampling strategy.

28
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:09,620
We've talked a bit about that, but here we're talking about collecting the exposure to actually going out and collecting measurements.

29
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,490
And there's there is a lot that goes into it that you need to know about.

30
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:21,859
You know, there's kind of a small component to when we talked about the management aspect of this,

31
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:25,400
but there are the technical aspects as well that we need to know.

32
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:30,770
So there's a lot of questions about sampling. What is the what's the issue?

33
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:36,680
We want to know what are the goals? Are we looking to compare with Mobil?

34
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,760
Are we looking to just get a handle on the situation?

35
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:43,850
Is it for another purpose that's going to help us decide what we need to do?

36
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:49,070
We can decide between area samples and personal samples and we'll talk about that.

37
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:56,380
A lot of occupational standards and guidelines are based on personal samples, so that's a lot of times what we're going for.

38
00:03:56,390 --> 00:04:04,070
But if you have a different purpose for your sampling, maybe area is of use or easier or maybe it's even better for something.

39
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:11,990
I've done studies where we're looking at general controls and certain aspects that that area sampling is very helpful.

40
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:17,899
But for the most part for occupational we are focused on the personal samples and area is also

41
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:22,670
good for like a initial survey of the situation in the sense of what's in the environment.

42
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:27,890
We also have a grab sample versus real time versus integrated samples.

43
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:35,690
So we've touched on this because the tox concerns are we're talking about something that's long term or short term, acute or chronic,

44
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:41,569
that's going to help us determine if we want to take a short term sample or a long term sample we've been talking

45
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:46,250
about the last week is chemical properties that's going to help us decide what kind of equipment we need.

46
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,590
Of course, we have our standards and guidelines that are going to tell us what we're comparing to.

47
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:54,860
If that's our goal and this pesky thing.

48
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:58,790
Variability and exposure is always something that we it's always difficult,

49
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:05,089
but something you want to want to think about and try to account for as much as you can and then a lot goes into it.

50
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:10,700
Regarding the actual methodology needs, how sensitive this enough need to be that sometimes relates to cost.

51
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:13,460
How much money do you have in your budget to do something like this?

52
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:20,720
Some of those items that we're always trying to keep an eye on, maximizing the information we gave for for every dollar spent.

53
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:30,700
Little bit more area versus personal. I already talked about the time weighted average versus direct reading.

54
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,910
That's something we'll also discuss. Time weighted average.

55
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:43,360
A lot of the occupational exposure limits are based on the time of year, so that's usually a motivation to collect a sample in that way.

56
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,629
But sometimes, again, if you're doing a walk through survey,

57
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:51,790
maybe a direct radiograph sample is good or if there's a high concern for an acute hazard.

58
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,500
So that's another way of setting or that's really helpful.

59
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,840
Active versus passive. Today, we're going to focus on active sampling.

60
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:10,020
We'll talk about passive sampling in a future lecture. But active means where we're using energy for air samples, drawing air through pollen.

61
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:15,090
If we're talking about water sampling, we'd be pulling water through a filter somehow.

62
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:16,880
Yeah.

63
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:25,040
So so for that area is that's kind of like a cross-sectional snapshot at one time for some lifetime area could also be a long duration or a short.

64
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:26,970
You can also do grab samples for area.

65
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:32,880
Again, if you're doing a walk through and you think there might be a certain gas of concern and you had a specific monitor for that,

66
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,090
you can do grab samples or you can do time, wait hours.

67
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:41,910
That's very sampling time. We had averages a lot of what they do in ambient environment like the professor was talking about.

68
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:50,760
And we'll come back and talk more about that in the semester. That's an example of a long term time weighted average area sample.

69
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,170
And so we'll talk more about active sampling know today and then passive sampling in the future.

70
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,610
So this is an example of active sample set up.

71
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:15,750
The key here is this device is a sample pump and it's going to be pulling air through a tube that's connected to some sort of collection media.

72
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:21,090
And that collection media is going to change based on the properties of our chemical agent of concern.

73
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:25,590
So this is point here through the filter at a known rate.

74
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:31,860
And then you can analyze that filter for the mass of the chemical of interest and divide it by the.

75
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:54,510
Sometimes there's also real time over featured lecture notes, real time as well.

76
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:58,410
So we're just primarily today talking about time weighted average active sampling.

77
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:06,190
And this is a typical setup. This, though, is more for this is a filter that's a lot of times more use for aerosols.

78
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:12,879
And we will discuss that as well. So here's a pretty bad drawing about what we just talked about.

79
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:18,550
So we have a sample pack, some sort of tube in the people contaminated air being pulled through,

80
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:24,670
some sort of collection, media filter for aerosols, some sort of other material for for gases.

81
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:33,850
And then you take your mask collected and divide it by the the flow rate volume pretty at a time

82
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:40,210
times the amount of time you sampled and that's your concentration of the contaminant in the air.

83
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:49,780
So time will average. Like we said, most oils are present on as an average over an eight hour workday within the context of a 40 hour workweek.

84
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:56,620
Whether or not that's really what's going on in a particular facility is is questionable.

85
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:04,690
But that's sort of the standard the next time to show some possibilities for collecting an eight hour time weighted average.

86
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:09,820
And without looking at the answer, I want to see if you guys can guess which one would be the most ideal.

87
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:13,120
So the first one, we have a single sample that collects over an eight hour period.

88
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:17,139
The next option is a few consecutive samples.

89
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:25,900
Here's one two different times. Three different samples add up to 8 hours because they're collected consecutively.

90
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:32,170
Or would you want more samples sort of spread throughout multiple days that don't cover for 8 hours in a day?

91
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:36,280
Or would you want to piece together a bunch of random grab samples?

92
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:44,140
Which one you guys think would be the most ideal or the most desirable for our time weighted average?

93
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:49,920
So you would agree with that? Yeah, everyone likes it.

94
00:09:50,070 --> 00:10:00,150
Well, you're right. Good job, guys. You may want to think about why that maybe kind of gives you, like, the frequency and the ratio.

95
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:07,639
I mean, yeah, so it's gonna be the same duration, but, you know, statistically, it's going to help is it gives you more data points, but you know,

96
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:12,330
more conceptually I like it because you might get a better indicator of variability throughout the day,

97
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:17,340
whereas if you just had that one eight hour chunk, you don't know if it's just that one concentration.

98
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:24,060
But with this, you can get different ideas about, you know, is it higher in the morning versus the afternoon?

99
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:28,330
We've done something called task based exposure assessment will work,

100
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:34,230
will hook up while they're doing a certain task and then switch out the filters and so on to

101
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:38,610
get a much more precise estimate of what the various things are doing throughout the day.

102
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:44,450
Wait, wait until, you know, our agency, the same sampling, the different sampling types.

103
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:49,200
So you get their own specificities and sensitivity. Oh, yeah, great question.

104
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:53,420
We're assuming here that this is the same method, same media.

105
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:58,589
It's just switching out to a different filter or media with the same flow rate.

106
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:03,510
Same. Sure. Okay. Good question. But the caveat is, yeah, if it was different, that would be a different story.

107
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:09,540
But it'd be hard to do combined because we like the option to combine them to get that eight hour it would compare with it.

108
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:13,590
But we'll we also like the flexibility to looking at variability and things like that.

109
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:18,170
So good point. So yep, that's the first one.

110
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:25,280
Second one we you think? We're going to say the top one because, you know,

111
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:30,380
we do want to get our sample because what if there's a huge peak in exposure right here that we're missing?

112
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:35,479
Same with down here. There you're just piecing together, guessing kind of what what your exposure is.

113
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:39,860
So that's how we would rank these for a time with, you know, our time with the average.

114
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:45,140
Now, if you're looking at an acute hazard, you know, this would probably be done.

115
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,590
But we're looking at comparing with something more long term.

116
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:59,380
So again, we're trying to reflect the average full ship exposure because that's how a lot of the chronic hazard risk assessment wheels are set.

117
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:05,920
But it does average in times of high concentrations of times of low concentrations.

118
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:13,580
So again, that one single eight hour sample may not tell you a whole lot about what is the specific activities within

119
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,549
or four times you might need to do some policy if you really wanted to get into that level of detail.

120
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:23,020
But to compare in the standard, usually that's all you. So say okay.

121
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:26,620
So say you do have multiple samples collected throughout that period.

122
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:34,090
This is how you would combine them. Um, so your time weighted average is equal to the first concentration times,

123
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:42,550
the duration plus the second concentration, some duration divided by your total time that you sampled combined.

124
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:48,250
And assuming that it would be 8 hours in this case, that's how you get the time of that average.

125
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:59,140
So example, the three benzene samples were collected on a refinery worker were, you know, what did you do?

126
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:02,670
The following exposures. What would be the eight hour time weighted average?

127
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:12,710
I know you guys are tired of late in the day, but I'll give you just a minute or so to kind of tinker with it, to format.

128
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:23,250
You have a calculator and with half to keep in four and a half hours, one point 5 p.m. for one hour and point 8 p.m. for 2.5 hours.

129
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:27,029
So you always trick questions because you get sleep in here.

130
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:32,760
You know, it things don't actually add up to a, you know, that's one question or if the units are different, you just got to watch out for them.

131
00:13:33,630 --> 00:14:36,560
But in this one, it's pretty straightforward. We're being told it's time to be real.

132
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,650
My kids are my friends. I.

133
00:14:51,390 --> 00:15:01,590
All right, let's. So if we look back a slide at equation, it's simply combining our concentration of times time over our summed up time.

134
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:12,640
So it comes out 2.5 times 4.5 plus 1.5 times one plus point eight times 2.5 divided by eight should get a point seven.

135
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:23,380
So that's you know, any time I show an example like this, that's a good sense that it might show up on a quiz and some of the problems that.

136
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:32,890
Okay. So how do we go about selecting a method? There's a lot of different things out there.

137
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:37,240
These are considered the gold standard if they're available.

138
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:42,630
Nyack's an OSHA occupational. I have EPA out here.

139
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:46,080
Just remember, that's going to be more for your environmental related.

140
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:51,590
But the top two here are your go tos for occupational therapy.

141
00:15:52,720 --> 00:16:01,450
There's also accredited, so the American Industrial Hygiene Association has an accredited accrediting system for laboratories that do the measurement.

142
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:05,140
So you send your samples to them and they'll send you back results.

143
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:11,830
Well, I'm not very good at talking you through if you have questions about a method or trying to choose between methods.

144
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:19,780
The good ones, these good labs that we'll talk you through which ones they like better or they found work better.

145
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,559
So that's that can be a good resource as well. You just never know in the back of your mind.

146
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,799
It's, it's a for profit laboratory, so keep that in mind.

147
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:31,720
But they can be very helpful and sometimes they've even modified slightly based on

148
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:38,080
things that they thought could be optimized and still offer a legally defensible data.

149
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,950
So the first one is the nice manual, the analytical methods. This one, there's a link.

150
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:49,389
It's got tons of methods on there. It's updated every so often.

151
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:57,070
I think they updated it last in 2016, but they have all kinds of air sampling.

152
00:16:57,070 --> 00:17:00,400
They also touch on bio monitoring as well.

153
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,560
And these, as we talk about now,

154
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:09,730
it's more the research and education arm of OSHA itself through the Occupational Safety of Occupational Safety and Health Act.

155
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:17,710
So they really do do a deep dove and work on these methods, test them, validate them and publish them.

156
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:27,160
So they're usually quite good. We also have chapters in here on quality assurance and things like that.

157
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:35,140
But if you go to this link, you'll see you can go by a chemical name, you can download the entire book if you want,

158
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:42,940
but a lot of times you'll just go through and find the chemical you want, or if you know the method number, you do it that way.

159
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:48,910
Let's see what they got. Let's try it for chromium.

160
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:53,740
Hexavalent chromium, they have three different methods. So four different methods.

161
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,980
So you'd have to think, well, you know, what's your media wants to dust?

162
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:04,899
What sort of arranged indeed what kind of conditions are before you.

163
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:08,920
But you can get a sense for how many methods they have here.

164
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:14,040
It's become my favorite color player for us.

165
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:25,680
It's lumped in with other phosphorous pesticides and you can see it's pretty detailed and we've had some promise that too.

166
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:34,620
I have you kind of dig through all of these and look at what they offer, but they give you a ton of information on conditions for sampling,

167
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:42,210
what you clearly you need all kinds of details there, how sensitive it is, etc.

168
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,860
Why is this your favorite? I don't know.

169
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:55,370
It's. I studied it as part of my doctoral dissertation, and then it's always in the news because they want to ban it,

170
00:18:55,370 --> 00:19:01,150
because it causes neurodevelopment problems and kids. But it's, like, impossible to say.

171
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:05,540
It just popped up in the news every couple of years because it's still around.

172
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:10,160
They did ban it for residential use, but it's still used in agricultural.

173
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:16,250
I think they did just regulated on like golf courses and stuff, but it's always just kind of in limbo.

174
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:21,770
So it's just one that I always look for and it's always sort of there.

175
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:27,890
It's it used to be one of the most widely used of all sizes and broad spectrum.

176
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:31,920
So it killed all kinds of stuff. You know.

177
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:43,860
Not very specialized. And they I just noticed this last night they are still releasing new stuff here.

178
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:50,400
So this one was just released last month, September 20, 22.

179
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,840
This is one of our former students, Kendra. She was here.

180
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:58,439
To me, it seems like couple of years ago, I don't go have to look up.

181
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:02,579
But she's at 907. Looks like she's now publishing reports.

182
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:06,070
But this is on the surface just last month.

183
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:16,470
So they do update it now and again. So that's nice.

184
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:22,050
Again, very, very strong. Oh, she also has their own methods.

185
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:26,850
Sometimes they'll be very similar to the Nash method. Other. Other times, maybe not.

186
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:29,530
And you want to pay attention to this as well.

187
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:37,350
But this these kill a ton of attention because this is what they're likely to use if they're going to come out and do an inspection.

188
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:42,320
A compliance standpoint. So a lot of employers kind of want to make sure they're in line.

189
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:48,209
They're getting results that are going to be similar to what he or she is getting on, you know, their own website.

190
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:54,990
They do have caveats because it is also they're saying, you know, they can change it at any time without this and things like that.

191
00:20:55,710 --> 00:21:01,050
But they do have a listing. And again, you want to go back why?

192
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:09,720
These chemicals have multiple ways you can name them and synonyms or like street names for pesticides.

193
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:16,620
There's all kinds of names for pesticides. So that serious number is something you always kind of want to match up if possible.

194
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:24,000
Let's take a quick look at this one. So here we have our analytical methods A to Z.

195
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:30,680
So quite a bit. Some say a fully validated, other self partially validated.

196
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:35,440
So that's another thing to consider if you're choosing between Ocean Beach.

197
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:45,310
So I remember when the Hex Come Standard came out, the publishers A250 in which everyone was then starting to use it for expedia.com.

198
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:52,730
So it should line up quite a bit with, you know, the types of information it gives you with the nicest methods.

199
00:21:53,390 --> 00:22:01,300
But. You know, you you want to make sure if you're if you're trying to decide, see what this one is.

200
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:09,830
This is an area where 62 to bear volume, sampling rate, target concentrations.

201
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:15,590
Again, if you did some of your screening work, we have an idea of what kind of level you expect to see or want to see.

202
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:23,060
You can use some of this information before you will sample to make sure it's within the range of possibility.

203
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:44,380
And then I'm a CPA. This is more for environmental. However, I have used some of these on in work environments for surface sampling, both material.

204
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:49,450
If you're trying to trace back a source, sometimes the EPA has better methods for that type of thing.

205
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:56,050
But for air, typically you'll go to the natural ocean. These would be said for an EPA that we'll talk about later in the semester.

206
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:06,800
Other resources. I mentioned laboratories.

207
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:10,450
There's also companies that sell the equipment. They're more than happy to help you.

208
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:13,720
They want to build that customer relationship.

209
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:22,120
But they they do have a lot of information, especially when it comes to sampling media for a particular.

210
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:26,110
So I show these methods. They'll tell you the flow rates, the equipment,

211
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:33,990
and they'll tell you what kind of media you need to use that you would then send to a lab and, you know, sell that media.

212
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:46,450
So they're more than happy to talk to you through. I went to the Industrial Agent Conference this year, brought back some some literature catalogs.

213
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:54,940
It passes around anybody wants to look at. And I also brought that covered when I'm in a conference is in Nashville.

214
00:23:55,660 --> 00:24:01,870
I knew I shouldn't have gone to that karaoke bar, but it was fun.

215
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:10,510
There's also, as we talked about, there might be chemicals that are pretty specific to a specific company,

216
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:16,390
so they might have their own methods for those researchers.

217
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:23,320
If they want to improve. One major way they might want to improve is sensitivity, a more sensitive method.

218
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:28,509
You might find stuff in the literature or maybe more modern methods that maybe I shouldn't.

219
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:33,920
I haven't had time to test and validate. And again, lab.

220
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:38,190
So here's a few more examples from the Bureau Veritas.

221
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:42,550
They have a location around here. They've been very helpful. They help teach.

222
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:48,490
I think they give guest lectures sometimes here as far as the chemistry analysis that are needed.

223
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,760
Gorleston Labs did it. Did you know this?

224
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:59,770
There's a bunch of these electronics. Again, they're they're good to talk to if you're not sure what you want to do.

225
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:08,829
So validating the analytical method, if you were to pull up any of these methods from my office or OSHA,

226
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:11,050
hopefully they give you information on all this,

227
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:19,600
the sampling rate you need to collect, the sample, the total amount of air you'll need if there's humidity concerns.

228
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:30,610
So there are some sampling methods or media or chemicals that if it's inside, outside of a range of humidity, you don't want to use that method.

229
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:34,660
And that will be helpful for the temperature as well.

230
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:36,549
What are there interferences there are.

231
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:41,830
So if you know in your work environment, it's got a certain chemical that would interfere with when you're trying to collect,

232
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:46,470
you might have to work involving methods. Big ones are accuracy and precision.

233
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,780
So it gives you a number. We talked about this with the target example.

234
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:56,050
You know, how close is it to reality here and how repeatable is it if you collect sample for sample?

235
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:01,000
So that should be posted as well. Sensitivity is a big one.

236
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:09,700
It's annoying to get all your samples back is less than detection unless I mean, it's good in the workplace.

237
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:16,389
Their exposures are so low. But as a researcher I don't like it because you have your data to analyze.

238
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:20,260
But I guess in the workplace, as long as that one level detection is very low,

239
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:25,660
if you can prove you're below that and that is way below that, we'll that's probably okay.

240
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:33,990
But it's always good to have the numbers to work with. But stability of the sample, do you have to store it in refrigeration?

241
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,640
Do you have to protect it from sunlight after you collect it? Some of those things should be online as well.

242
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:49,969
So it all goes. These methods. Here's an old flow chart from Ash back in the day where they have, you know,

243
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:55,940
literally the search literature for similar methods that pick a procedure.

244
00:26:56,450 --> 00:27:01,999
And then they start testing it for all these different things detection limits,

245
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:09,020
sensitivity interferences, precision, breakthrough absorption efficiency, storage.

246
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:13,670
And if it failed at any one of these, they would have to start over.

247
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:19,790
So you can see how much time and effort would go into validating just a single, single method.

248
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,950
So when you see that huge list of methods, you know,

249
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:31,550
a lot was invested in those and also suggests why they might not be updated all that frequently if they're doing their job.

250
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:37,940
A lot of times will be updated if you see an oil change. We're talking about oil's tend to go lower over time.

251
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:47,629
So if you see an oil change to where it's going to be close to a detection limit, that's when they'll really need to improve their methods.

252
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:53,090
And usually they have to do that way before the oil is changed to prove that it can be measured.

253
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:57,870
Low enough to to prove to prove that. Standard.

254
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:11,640
You guys are going to get to go out, rush out and buy some equipment, some at some MILLION+ prices.

255
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:15,130
They want you to call them. They really give you the sales pitch.

256
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:22,870
Okay. So general concepts time, we talk about kind of integrated sampling.

257
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,360
So that's where you collect sample over some time period.

258
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:33,220
And then with that sample media you analyze in the laboratory to get that mask and that gives you your eight hour concentration.

259
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:40,330
The alternative and we'll go into more detail on this later in semester is direct reading is the instantaneous measurement.

260
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:51,880
You can either read out as a single measure or some will record over time, which can be kind of cool to do that where you have this exposure profile,

261
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:57,250
which that would be very useful for determining what kinds of things lead to peaks in exposure.

262
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:02,620
And we'll talk about this later. But, you know, they don't have these for every type of chemical out there.

263
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:06,579
There's thousands of chemicals. They don't have specificity.

264
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:10,700
So to do that for all of them, but for some they do.

265
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:18,730
So it's always maybe worth looking into. Might be too expensive for a single chemical to invest in something like this, but might be.

266
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:25,420
And then with our method, we're getting just this dotted line that 8 hours, the starting line might move up and down.

267
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:34,750
If you're able to piece together multiples like we talked about you three, three in a row know here, one here and one here, things like that.

268
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:42,880
But for the most part, that's the main difference between direct reading and or integrated exposure measurement.

269
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:52,180
So this is just reiterating some of the main categories and differences, active versus passive.

270
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:56,950
Main difference is that pump for air area versus person.

271
00:29:57,020 --> 00:30:05,139
Personal. Personal monitors tend to be smaller and usually less expensive area monitors like ambient air pollution.

272
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:13,570
Those things can be quite large. And then gases and vapors versus aerosols.

273
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:19,749
The the fundamentals that we talked about for gas in a big they they are based on

274
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:24,520
chemistry whereas aerosol it's more physics in how we go about collecting for sampling.

275
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:34,270
So here's our sample tray again. I should include the picture. But here's our point.

276
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:43,840
Here's the error. We have that collector. So our sample, the air flow meter is usually attached to the pump.

277
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:46,590
And that's our question.

278
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:55,860
So if we're talking about gases and vapors like we will be for today, we have three different primary collection methods and we'll come back to that.

279
00:30:55,930 --> 00:31:07,130
Different doing aerosols is based on those fundamentals we just talked about last time with those collection mechanisms, but the same set up on that.

280
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:12,899
The thing that changes this, the other main difference is the flow rate is usually a much higher flow rate for

281
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:19,140
aerosols than you do for guests and vapors because gas and vapors you're depending on,

282
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:22,650
you want them to kind of linger as they interact with the collection medium.

283
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:27,180
Whereas for aerosols, you need some of those, you know, impaction or impaction.

284
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:35,310
Sometimes it's some good flow rate. So a little bit more on Ponce.

285
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:42,540
You may have noticed some in the catalogs that were going around some basic categories here, low flow pumps.

286
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:51,670
These might go all the way down to ten milliliters per minute or 0.01 liters per minute, maybe up to about two.

287
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:56,430
And like I said, gas and vapors, we tend to go for much lower flow rates.

288
00:31:57,150 --> 00:32:01,800
High flow pumps, maybe 1 to 5 liters per minute more common for aerosols.

289
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:05,900
And they have multifunction pumps, which are good because they're versatile.

290
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:11,880
You have you know, if you're a consultant and you don't know where you're going to be, it's probably good on the best in class a little more.

291
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:23,140
But you could do low flow and higher. For comparison, if you're doing outdoor ambient air, you might be looking at 300 to 300 liters per minute.

292
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:27,040
But we're usually in that, you know, less than 1 to 5 liters per minute.

293
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:33,360
Occupational people, in a way. It's like.

294
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:42,890
You mean one person? No. I mean, that could play a role, I suppose, if you're trying to emulate what's going on.

295
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,320
Mainly it's because of the occupational climate, much higher levels typically.

296
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:56,330
So for outdoor you tend to need a lot of denominator, a lot of volume to be able to detect what you're looking for.

297
00:32:56,900 --> 00:33:03,680
Whereas in the workplace, if you're sampling for it, you might be talking about fairly high levels.

298
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:07,520
So I've shown pictures of these particularly battery powered.

299
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:17,210
They're working on the weights, 1 to £3, usually constant flow so they can accommodate back flow.

300
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:24,709
Some of those in the catalog, they had some pretty flowery language about how great they are at maintaining their their flow rate,

301
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:29,540
which is important because you need to know how much air went through their program.

302
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:35,000
Well, these days, they're they're getting pretty fancy. These are just some main suppliers.

303
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:44,760
I'm not. Uh, endorsing any particular rule and calibration is a very important factor.

304
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:52,480
Here's some more pictures. This one looks super old, right?

305
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:57,670
I just looked it still in the catalog. It's a it's an oldie but goodie.

306
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,110
I brought a couple of samples from there, from my museum downstairs.

307
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:07,120
So, you know, it's not like that.

308
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:11,980
So just to give you guys a kind of a sense of the scale here, I think the batteries are dead.

309
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:17,270
Right. And there's the tubing and that's a filter on that one. Yeah.

310
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:22,240
Here. This one I tried to charge for class for.

311
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:27,880
So you guys can see how loud it is. I don't think it worked.

312
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:44,040
It's not working. This is a different brand. A sense of what have you is and where that all they can see, they've come out with some smaller ones.

313
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:50,940
Sometimes they're lower flow. So, you know, if you are only interested in gas and vapors, you might be able to get away with a much smaller pump.

314
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:56,850
But this one's of a two passing on the ones that go high or low flow.

315
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:06,660
So this is like an example of calibrator here.

316
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:14,459
Well, now. It's not just different brands.

317
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:18,750
They might look different. This is a low flow. Looks like simpler.

318
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:25,640
This is a newer one. You can see all the fancy digital stuff like the weather and that's on it.

319
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:28,950
Yeah, I play your music on there.

320
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:36,360
I got to know, I think when I saw Avatar, I was talking to the guy at the conference and you know, they're trying to sell me on this one.

321
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:43,680
But this one, I guess it has a dock that you charge it on and it'll sync up with your calibration data.

322
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:50,730
So basically all this fancy stuff is just taken out. So you don't have to do actually any calculations yourself, which I think is kind of dangerous.

323
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:57,239
If people don't have any way to check, double check that things are going well could spell trouble.

324
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:01,620
So yeah, that's the main. Looks like it's probably a bit later.

325
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:06,059
I did handle one of these. It is pretty dense.

326
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:10,830
Still got to get you know that battery's going to last a while, especially for the high end.

327
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:18,540
But battery technology is getting better. So I would think stuff like this is fairly specialized.

328
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:21,479
So, you know, the technology makes it eventually.

329
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:26,130
It's just the market demand is not as high for like a cell phone world, you know, updated every year.

330
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:35,180
But it does take a bit longer for this kind of stuff. Here's just some examples.

331
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:39,260
We've shown this guy before. You have your collection material in here.

332
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:43,010
That's a little different than the filter being tossed around here.

333
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:46,880
Somebody collecting what they're wearing out on the larger pumps.

334
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:56,900
This woman's wearing that one and passing around. So one thing I don't like about these pictures, so when I was doing a lot of field work,

335
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:02,630
we would use a little bit longer tubing and not hook it on the front because if they're doing stuff,

336
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:09,020
if you get tangled up, you pull that out, then your samples are only going to start over, come back the next day.

337
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:13,340
So we would tend to do it like this, refill the back.

338
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:21,880
He put the sampler as close to the breathing zone basically as he can without causing a bias in your question.

339
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:27,410
So you're trying to get that breathing zone. The personal is why it's up here.

340
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:33,230
Let's get to it. A lot of them.

341
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:41,690
All right. Calibration so must be calibrated before and after.

342
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:45,680
That's very important. And you'll do more of this.

343
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:49,669
Those of you going on to take the lab course, you'll actually do some of those.

344
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:52,500
But that's the only way you know what to find.

345
00:37:53,480 --> 00:38:01,340
That's another potential concern with the fancier new pumps that will show you exactly what the flow rate is if those aren't themselves calibrated.

346
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:08,840
That could lead to two issues. And you'll see, one, do you have a road, a meter built in?

347
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:15,640
That's more just to make sure they're still running. I don't really trust that I've done jobs where.

348
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:23,540
So that abrasive blasting job I did is so bad in there that you get clogged and they'd come out in bowls down here.

349
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:27,230
Are you doing. I can't use that sample at all. We don't have any idea how long.

350
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:36,820
So that's good just to make sure it's still going. But what you want to do is before and after each sample.

351
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:43,520
So if you're sampling multiple days with multiple pumps, you do this for every pump every day before you start and after you finish.

352
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,170
And there's guidelines on how close together those need to be in order to accept the sample.

353
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:51,650
If it's off by more than I can remember, maybe 10%.

354
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:57,890
It's questionable because then you're really not super certain how much air you collect.

355
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:04,490
And then when you get into calibration, there's different standards.

356
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:09,860
There's primary versus secondary. Somebody who retired sent me.

357
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:16,550
The old school primary. It's basically a giant beaker.

358
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:20,660
The one in my office, like, this is, like, this tall and it's bigger round.

359
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:24,110
Basically, is is the fourth way to do it.

360
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:32,480
There's also electronic methods secondary that you have to calibrate to a primary that you might use in the field again,

361
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:38,840
may not be as legally defensible. So I wouldn't recommend this all the time, but maybe mid shift or something.

362
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:45,800
If you want to just take a a check, that's a world meter. Like you might see a fruit on there and other test meters.

363
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:50,899
You do really want to, if possible, use that primary soap method.

364
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:55,160
Is that old school or. Okay, so here's the setup.

365
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:59,330
So this is like where I have it. I should have, right?

366
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:05,620
Carry around. He's actually bigger than that one. But here we have a pump.

367
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:12,880
And then this is kind of a tough set up to that point of pulling in.

368
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:21,240
You put bubbles down here and pulls air up, you know, the rubber stopper in here and you know exactly what the volume is.

369
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:24,250
So you just time how long it takes to get from one to the other.

370
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:29,170
And that gives you the flow rate so you can see how it's kind of a pain.

371
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:33,820
So you have to get a nice level of self going up.

372
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:39,760
You have to have this too, so you don't get soap in your pump. So it's not not great.

373
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:47,110
But that's what they used back in the old days. You kind of do that in a lab once, but I'm not that old.

374
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:50,710
Okay, so nowadays it's more like this.

375
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:56,220
The electronic ones. This one still does you. So. Use this one on one.

376
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:59,830
So it is kind of a pain still. You don't feel a little bit self in this bottom part.

377
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:04,390
It has the plunger that you push down and then it'll time.

378
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:08,880
It's got sensors here, in here. No time. How long it takes for that. But we'll get from there.

379
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:11,980
There. Good thing about this is you can do a bunch of them in a row.

380
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:19,540
So you get an average of at least 3 to 5. Make sure you're getting accurate readings.

381
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:25,690
What else going into it. So you'd have your tubing to the pump up here.

382
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:32,560
And you also need to make sure you have the sample media in mind because you need to know what the pressure drop is across that.

383
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:42,150
So it's you don't have the pump, you have the salt filters, and then you just have another tube coming out this end here.

384
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:47,800
So you want the air to pass through that filter so you can account for that pressure drop.

385
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:53,709
So that's this one. This one. There's a newer technology. It doesn't use bubbles.

386
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:58,040
It's a frictionless piston that it.

387
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:05,950
Both of these are supposed to be recalibrated by the manufacturer every year or so just to make sure they're still operating.

388
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:09,520
Because if something happened to that piston, you see how that would be off.

389
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:21,060
Any questions on that? So an important thing to do, maybe not the most exciting, but.

390
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:27,280
Let's get there's a couple more examples. This one brings back memories for me.

391
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:32,020
So you just punch this and there's a sensor and automatically read that.

392
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:39,540
There's another different brand there. Okay.

393
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:47,850
Let's get to our guests and Baker Sample. So once we have that set up, we have our pump or tubing.

394
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:52,480
We know what flow is coming through here. Then our collector, what do we do here?

395
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:56,310
This is where it really gets different between gas and vapors and aerosols.

396
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:59,880
So for gas and maybe two or three options, the first is air storage.

397
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:05,580
We also have liquid absorption. And then the third one is absorption on granular, solid.

398
00:43:06,090 --> 00:43:10,920
So we'll just go through each of these fairly quickly. So air storage is that first one.

399
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:16,400
This is also known as whole air sampling. So this is how air sampling got its start.

400
00:43:16,410 --> 00:43:22,890
I believe they would collect air in a thing and then take that thing back to the lab and analyze it.

401
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:35,010
So something called the vacuum flask, gas displacement bottles, stainless steel flask, polymeric bags, and something called the super canister.

402
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:42,540
These top three, I don't think are used anymore. So we'll focus on the bottom two is do you get some use?

403
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:49,680
So Palmer bags. So this is different types of makeup.

404
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:54,410
Again, it might be important based on what chemical you're collecting, to know that it doesn't react.

405
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:59,030
That's why they're made with different types of materials.

406
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:03,770
So some advantages here. You know, you have a simple, unknown volume that you're collecting.

407
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:10,340
It's lightweight. You don't have to pre concentrate or stabilize before going out.

408
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:17,570
But you have to worry about potential losses of air through lines with the pump in the bag itself after you collect.

409
00:44:18,050 --> 00:44:23,480
So you collect at one temperature, you go outside and it's a much different temperature you might have.

410
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:27,680
Or if you take it on an airplane, that could be can be problematic.

411
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:32,150
So that's that's one option. Suma canisters.

412
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:37,250
This is more common for more and become an indoor air quality.

413
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:44,150
So we'll come back to this as well later in the semester. But I have seen it used now in the workplace.

414
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:47,960
And if, you know, if your workplace is an office that's where this indoor air quality.

415
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:57,450
Workplace Comics. Here are some examples of sampling bags ten layers of material.

416
00:44:58,330 --> 00:45:02,340
So the guy who teaches first and then turns these to the students who always gone tomorrow.

417
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:06,450
I guess that's perfect.

418
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:09,960
Yeah. Alumina is mylar.

419
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:15,330
So again, it's got a human built in for a reason, probably to prevent reactivity.

420
00:45:15,810 --> 00:45:19,620
Here's a pen just to get this sense of scale. Was 12 meters up here.

421
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:27,030
I didn't bring any of these in for show until we'll have some sort of manifold here to give the area.

422
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:29,570
That can then be sealed.

423
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:38,760
And you know, just rule of thumb, you don't want to overfill because that pressure can be problematic elsewhere in the scheme.

424
00:45:40,050 --> 00:45:48,240
And again, you really want to line up the chemical collecting with the type of back to make sure there's no reactivity concerns.

425
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:57,490
All right. So looking at this list, which what do you think?

426
00:45:57,550 --> 00:46:06,760
You think I'm going to go and advise you to do a lot of banks, that the balance of advantages, disadvantages is not quite what I'm used to.

427
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:16,630
But as we talk about simple loan volume lately, but a lot of disadvantages to be concerned about stabilization losses on impact upon.

428
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:24,230
Leaks permeation. If it's really low concentrations, you only collect a few liters of air.

429
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:28,880
You might not have enough to detect it. I like this one.

430
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:34,610
You know, we talk about hooking something up to a breathing zone to imagine 312 in your bag,

431
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:40,670
but your breathing zone, that would be a little too awkward. So, again, it's an option.

432
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:48,590
You guys see anything wrong with this picture besides really portraying really sharp edges on my back?

433
00:46:50,330 --> 00:46:53,690
From a sampling standpoint. Do you see any potential issues here?

434
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:56,990
I get lost in the pump. Yeah, it's going through a part.

435
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,080
And if you want a pristine sample, that's. It's not going to be ideal.

436
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:07,180
Yeah, there's a lot you don't know what's in that pump because it could throw off your value.

437
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:10,970
So to get around that, there's another way to do this.

438
00:47:11,570 --> 00:47:21,290
So what you do is you use some sort of airtight container. This Tupperware style thing I grew up is like a Kleenex, you know?

439
00:47:21,290 --> 00:47:24,380
It's like a name you use for a thing that's not actually the brand.

440
00:47:24,470 --> 00:47:30,770
Okay. So think of, you know, a cake box, big hair type thing you can you can do.

441
00:47:31,670 --> 00:47:35,390
But basically it creates a negative pressure.

442
00:47:35,990 --> 00:47:44,450
So instead of having to go through the pump, you connect the pump to the container, have another inlet with a connector.

443
00:47:44,810 --> 00:47:51,500
And as you pump air out of here, it's going to fill a bag that you can then seal and analyze without having to go through the pump.

444
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:55,700
So the Tupperware is closed. Yeah, it's airtight.

445
00:47:55,700 --> 00:48:00,380
So in these catalogs, they probably have, as Casey one probably still sells this.

446
00:48:01,610 --> 00:48:06,739
It's just a fancier version. But I think that's probably straight from the website.

447
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:14,150
So you can see it's airtight. You lock that up, you connect your pump to one, and then inside you connect the bag.

448
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:20,330
And then when you're done sampling this bag and take it to the laboratory.

449
00:48:20,990 --> 00:48:22,970
So that's how you get around.

450
00:48:23,390 --> 00:48:30,020
But note that, you know, you have stainless steel fittings at each place that you really try to cut down on contamination concerns.

451
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:42,460
Again, these come in a lot of different types of materials, but water, mylar, Teflon.

452
00:48:42,610 --> 00:48:50,680
So, you know, you have you're in like Valleys and PBS and some of these it's great for chemicals.

453
00:48:51,070 --> 00:48:54,610
So, you know that you might see some changes. And so we're going to get to these over time.

454
00:48:56,150 --> 00:48:59,260
Scott, Japan. Flexible.

455
00:49:00,690 --> 00:49:07,440
Some of these might be fairly specialized. I'm assuming cancer again will come back to this.

456
00:49:07,450 --> 00:49:14,140
This is an example of somebody using one in the indoor air quality assessment signs that the sense of scale and here's a basketball

457
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:21,730
they also have small ones here's baseball these are kind of cool because in the lab they're like totally depressurized.

458
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:29,410
So you just open them a little bit in the field and they'll just bring in air passively,

459
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:34,450
depending on how much you open it, and the method will tell you how to do that.

460
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:41,800
So there's a lot of negative pressure when you take it out there, open it. You might go for, you know, 24 hours at the right center.

461
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:49,510
Give me an average of the time, and then that's taken back to lab and they just hook it up straight to a GC or something.

462
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:59,160
Sure. That seems a lot for bosses. Any questions on the air storage methods.

463
00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:07,800
Kind of quick but it's to fairly specialized and you might work with that in mind as you take the lab class.

464
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:15,720
The next one is liquid absorption and chemical reaction. Again, gases and vapors is what we're talking about.

465
00:50:16,770 --> 00:50:21,240
So here the main two types are called integers and for bubblers.

466
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:30,240
So here we're taking air through a pond and instead of this filter, you connect it to a glass bottle with some liquid.

467
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:35,790
And it sounds like a bad idea. Right? But there are some methods that use this.

468
00:50:36,750 --> 00:50:43,200
Some of them are made of plastic. But again, plastic might harbor chemicals more readily than glass.

469
00:50:43,830 --> 00:50:47,580
So hopefully they got that figured out.

470
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:54,120
But there's two steps here. One is you pull in the air and it's absorbed by the liquid.

471
00:50:54,600 --> 00:51:02,320
But the reason you're using a liquid is because you can put a reactant in there to form a more stable product that then you can measure from the left.

472
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:05,640
So this is best for reactive gases and vapors.

473
00:51:07,970 --> 00:51:15,020
You steal formaldehyde, things like that. So things that aren't going to be stable with other types of collection media.

474
00:51:15,350 --> 00:51:21,230
You might need a way to stabilize that. And one of the classic methods is this liquid.

475
00:51:22,410 --> 00:51:27,000
Absorption in chemical reaction. Here's what it looks like.

476
00:51:27,990 --> 00:51:33,060
One example, this is called a threaded bubbler. And what this does is it brings the air.

477
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:38,130
So you hook this to the pump. So it's going to bring the air through this liquid and it's got a little tiny openings.

478
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:42,660
So it's going to push out little tiny air bubbles instead of a big air.

479
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:48,840
But we're trying to maximize that surface area to increase the absorption into the into the liquid.

480
00:51:50,550 --> 00:51:58,890
And depending on what you're collecting, the method will outline what kind of reagent is needed in this liquid for a specific chemical.

481
00:52:01,930 --> 00:52:15,030
So, you know, looking at the utility base, collecting a basic gas will be a massive formaldehyde to the disulfide society at the time.

482
00:52:16,390 --> 00:52:22,580
I think so. Again, two steps. It's absorbed and then reacts to stabilize it.

483
00:52:24,810 --> 00:52:29,140
You may use this before. I actually have not either.

484
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:39,370
So it sounds like a lot of work, but sometimes it might be necessary for these three active agents.

485
00:52:40,030 --> 00:52:48,760
Here's some examples of reactive inorganic gases. So two and oh two and age three that these methods might be available for.

486
00:52:52,230 --> 00:52:57,629
An offshoot of this is instead of using that liquid, so new methods might be using this.

487
00:52:57,630 --> 00:53:02,700
Instead you have a filter, kind of like what I passed around, but it's pretreated filter.

488
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:11,190
They call it impregnated with a reagent. So then you pull air through again with gas and vapors, you're usually using a very low flow rate.

489
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:19,950
So instead of pushing it through that liquid, it's going past this filter that will trap that and react with that gas or paper.

490
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:26,580
And then you send it to a lab and it can be analyzed for that product it forms there.

491
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:34,960
It can also be used for reactive aerosols. But because we're not talking about aerosols today, I'm going to skip over that for a.

492
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:41,380
Aerosols in the high pressure you get both aerosol in the gas space.

493
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:50,049
Okay. And notably, I did some digging around in the new ocean method for as the scientists does use

494
00:53:50,050 --> 00:53:56,000
this because I'm guessing they didn't want to use that liquid for various reasons.

495
00:53:56,830 --> 00:54:02,360
So that was the. So here's just an example like this cancer.

496
00:54:02,370 --> 00:54:08,540
They passed around the three protocols in it and react again.

497
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:18,019
It's got to be specific for the chemical plant. Here.

498
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:21,260
Just more examples of one that once that reaction happens.

499
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:25,610
See how that two stops the absorption and then the reaction. Then what do you measure?

500
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:27,800
Here's just an examples of what then is measured,

501
00:54:28,130 --> 00:54:36,530
and the methods worked out is such that the amount that you measure of the product can then be calculated to the agent of interest.

502
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:44,650
It's really tough. Hydrogen sulfide formaldehyde again that by sulfide complex.

503
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:50,040
And this is the filter.

504
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:55,380
You know, sometimes more desirable because you don't have that.

505
00:54:55,800 --> 00:55:00,210
You have, you know, some reagents and a liquid and you're messing around with in the field.

506
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:05,880
That can be dangerous if you don't know how much liquid is in there anymore, that can mess up your sample volumes.

507
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:10,980
So so these are, I think, more desirable for those reasons.

508
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:16,500
Yeah. How do they account for like incomplete reactions?

509
00:55:16,810 --> 00:55:22,139
I think reactivity hopefully they do in the in the method development.

510
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:27,510
And that's where the you know, if there's cross reactions with somebody else in, there could be an issue.

511
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:36,090
So yeah, I can foresee some potential issues there that hopefully are really spelled out clearly in the methodology.

512
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:40,899
Because yeah, you could think there's certain conditions,

513
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:46,360
especially if you're in a harsh industrial environment that might not be conducive to this sort of reaction.

514
00:55:46,370 --> 00:55:50,920
But again, they do quite a bit of testing.

515
00:55:51,730 --> 00:55:56,740
So if it's in a given range, I think that's also, you know, so they know you can't saturated.

516
00:55:57,340 --> 00:56:00,870
So there's a lot of stipulations to what the conditions have to be for this thing.

517
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:07,999
But yeah, I share your concern. Put slash media.

518
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:13,580
There's also it's not always a filter could be what we're going to talk about next the more absorptive material as well.

519
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:18,770
So that would help the filter to does it kind of to collect everything to.

520
00:56:20,810 --> 00:56:27,350
They say it works. So some advantages for absorption in chemical reaction are second of three.

521
00:56:27,350 --> 00:56:30,530
Collection methods for gases and vapors is versatile and selective.

522
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:36,920
Specific for them can pre concentrate the contaminant.

523
00:56:37,550 --> 00:56:44,060
If you have concerns about detection rates, it's most useful for reactive chemicals to stabilize them.

524
00:56:44,570 --> 00:56:51,500
And I mentioned humidity earlier, so some of these other collection methods aren't going to be good in really harsh, humid conditions.

525
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:55,790
So this would be much more stable for that, much more robust to humidity.

526
00:56:55,790 --> 00:57:05,630
So that might be another consideration. If you're in a super high humidity environment and you're picking between two methods, have simpler method.

527
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:10,440
It's outside the range for humanity for that one to look into this type of thing.

528
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:20,440
Disadvantage in some of those. You know, it just tackle issues in the field of breaking glass, doing liquids, things like that.

529
00:57:21,670 --> 00:57:26,020
Just mentioned interferences. Uh, you know, if you are using a reaction,

530
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:34,560
you need to know a lot about that reaction of what could go wrong for that to be a good measurement spilling.

531
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:46,240
But again, the use of, uh, treated filters and media are trying to fill those gaps with disadvantages.

532
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:51,400
Okay, so on to the third. Any questions about any of the questions about liquid absorption and chemical reaction?

533
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:59,190
Okay. Yeah it's and it's fairly specialized for react to things but it is sometimes necessary.

534
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:06,420
The third and most common form is the absorption adsorption by black granular solids.

535
00:58:08,190 --> 00:58:13,380
So here we have yes, these are the beavers adhering to the surface of a solid.

536
00:58:13,590 --> 00:58:17,219
That's the passing through the week, reversible forces.

537
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:22,260
So you want something that's going to be strong enough to keep it there and not flow right through to the pump,

538
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:27,360
but also something that you can then get back out later in the lab so you can measure it.

539
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:29,819
So that's what you want it to be.

540
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:42,090
Forces It's constant at the surface, of course, in this collection media and then it can be absorbed in the lab quite a lot of times by solvents,

541
00:58:42,270 --> 00:58:55,290
depending on the media could be thermal as well. I can't speak to whether this accounts for the most recent method development,

542
00:58:55,290 --> 00:59:01,770
but you just looked at the Naish Manual of Methods and analytical methods.

543
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:05,819
About half of them, almost half of them use this type of collection material.

544
00:59:05,820 --> 00:59:12,160
So very common. Filters are another 34%.

545
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:15,970
What we just talk about solutions only maybe 12%.

546
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:21,130
So that gives you a sense of scale. This is what it looks like.

547
00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:24,940
I couldn't find any in my office to bring to pass around.

548
00:59:25,390 --> 00:59:31,560
So we're talking about, you know, usually about this long. In its class.

549
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:37,450
It has 2 to 3 and a half.

550
00:59:37,620 --> 00:59:39,510
This is where the collection takes place.

551
00:59:39,990 --> 00:59:46,170
We have a form for wool separator and then another collection bed in the air is going to flow through that way.

552
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:55,980
It has plastic caps to take these off on both ends. You snap that, you basically just break the glass on both sides of there and pull through.

553
00:59:56,100 --> 01:00:02,520
And then after that, simply put, the plastic caps back on. And then a lot of times my need to cover it, I need to refrigerate it.

554
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:06,780
Because, again, we're talking about a couple of papers that might change on.

555
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:15,690
It's the same thing just showing the direction of the airflow and, you know, the front section,

556
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:20,070
which is usually 100 milligrams and the second section is usually half of that.

557
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:22,290
And we'll talk about why that's important.

558
01:00:22,650 --> 01:00:29,460
It's because you measure both at the lab front and back separately, and you sold them to get your total concentration.

559
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:41,550
But you also need to look at that ratio. If that backup section makes up more than ten or 20% of the total, then you're concerned about break through,

560
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:48,510
meaning you saturated the collection media and there might be a contaminant going out the other side.

561
01:00:49,110 --> 01:00:58,380
So that's what you want to avoid. So you want to analyze both sections and try to ensure that that ratio is is below ten or 20%.

562
01:01:01,930 --> 01:01:12,130
These are some microscope images and drawings of activated carbon as one common form of collection, one common material.

563
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:23,380
You see, it's got just tons of nooks and crannies when the air flows through for that vapor to bind weekly again, to be dissolved later on in the lab.

564
01:01:28,310 --> 01:01:39,380
So this is a quarter. And so they're different sizes depending on the target chemical and things like that.

565
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:44,640
But we typically know this big. And you might have a little holder for them.

566
01:01:44,650 --> 01:01:48,890
I'm also just pulling straight on the tubing, which probably isn't recommended to break.

567
01:01:49,610 --> 01:01:54,770
So they do that. There's this. It's like a commercial in here for us, Casey, isn't it?

568
01:01:56,120 --> 01:02:02,550
But yeah, they sell a lot of these tubes and. There's these guys again.

569
01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:06,870
I'm just pointing out that's the holder for the tooth.

570
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:12,420
They're. All right.

571
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:18,230
This is hard to depict graphically. So a true couple of different ways.

572
01:02:18,230 --> 01:02:26,340
But here we have our. Sample media tube.

573
01:02:26,770 --> 01:02:29,860
There's phone this way. Here's our front section. Here's your back section.

574
01:02:30,430 --> 01:02:35,409
So if you sample four time, one time, two time, three work, we're pretty good on time.

575
01:02:35,410 --> 01:02:41,560
Warning Type two. All of the contaminant is contained in that first section.

576
01:02:42,370 --> 01:02:45,730
Once we get to time three, we're seeing a little bit get into the back section,

577
01:02:46,180 --> 01:02:52,530
but it's still not enough to cause concern this time, for we've gone too long and we're saying, Oh,

578
01:02:53,260 --> 01:02:58,629
you know, once this back section gets partially saturated and fully saturated, at some point,

579
01:02:58,630 --> 01:03:02,230
all the contaminants just kind of go straight through multiple Section four saturated.

580
01:03:03,010 --> 01:03:07,060
Oh, that's what we want to avoid. So again, less than 10% good to go.

581
01:03:08,710 --> 01:03:16,690
10 to 20, we're a little bit suspicious. Hopefully that's not a common event, but over 20%, you don't know what that concentration is.

582
01:03:16,690 --> 01:03:20,049
You can't say with certainty what it is over.

583
01:03:20,050 --> 01:03:23,530
You can get a bit of information. You can say we know what the minimum is.

584
01:03:23,740 --> 01:03:28,750
We knew what was at least this mass was collected. We don't know if some escaped out the back.

585
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:34,090
So at least it gives you something. It's a it's a minimal but it's it's not ideal.

586
01:03:34,630 --> 01:03:46,330
So hopefully you'll come back re sample with either a tube with more absorbent material in it or a lower flow rate or a shorter sample time,

587
01:03:46,330 --> 01:03:53,409
whatever the parameters of that particular method will allow you to do in order to find the easiest way to reset all of the same stuff,

588
01:03:53,410 --> 01:03:57,310
just do successive shorter term samples and analyze all the.

589
01:04:06,010 --> 01:04:08,740
Selection of assortments, many types available.

590
01:04:08,860 --> 01:04:14,980
Here's a partial listing, and I think a big part of the liquor catalog probably has a bunch of tubes in there.

591
01:04:15,730 --> 01:04:21,470
So I mentioned activated carbon or charcoal, very common, but it's not effective for everything.

592
01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:27,310
So it has to match the chemical with the containment of interest as well as the environmental conditions.

593
01:04:28,420 --> 01:04:34,660
So to Joe, you get something from Amazon and it comes with that little packet, silica gel packet.

594
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:38,680
It's there to soak up the water vapor and keep stuff dry.

595
01:04:39,510 --> 01:04:42,130
Actually, alumina polymers, these are very common.

596
01:04:42,910 --> 01:04:53,830
I've used these to that for various things synthetic carbons, molecular sieves, probably more expensive.

597
01:04:54,070 --> 01:04:58,660
But again, depending on the nature of interest, it might be better.

598
01:05:00,390 --> 01:05:05,010
This is a super old list. I'm having trouble finding an updated table like this.

599
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:16,770
We updated it just with more materials. And instead of solvent extraction, you're able to thermally disordered the.

600
01:05:17,810 --> 01:05:24,560
Two, but you can see activated carbon, tons of chemicals fall under that polar compounds.

601
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:31,130
You might want silica gel and other other compounds you might need more specialized collection.

602
01:05:38,790 --> 01:05:46,500
Okay. So factors affecting collection capacity with boiling point vapor pressure polarity flow rate,

603
01:05:47,010 --> 01:05:53,940
particle size activity quantity temperature humidity causes orbit and migration storage.

604
01:05:54,090 --> 01:06:00,540
So a lot of things to think about, right? So this is the most common of the three and a lot of times the most robust.

605
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:07,020
But we still have some concerns. And so like we talk about humidity and.

606
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:16,750
State stability. You might have to move to a reaction, a liquid or pregnant media.

607
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:22,120
But for other things, we just want to make sure it's within the method bounds for that.

608
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:26,920
So how do we think each of these is going to affect. So we have higher temperature.

609
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:32,800
You think our lower capacity in that absorbing it is higher or lower for higher temperature.

610
01:06:33,250 --> 01:06:37,750
It's going to increase our capacity to collect the easing of interest or decrease our capacity.

611
01:06:38,580 --> 01:06:47,650
Decrease. Why do you think? I don't know either.

612
01:06:47,780 --> 01:06:53,620
You're right. No, I did look it up. It. They're saying it's in the chapter I posted.

613
01:06:53,630 --> 01:06:57,880
It's an exothermic reaction when it collects the agent. So that gives out heat.

614
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:06,610
So the more heat involved, the less you to give to to be able to keep those bonds humidity, higher humidity you think more or less capacity.

615
01:07:10,420 --> 01:07:14,260
That's worse. Yeah. Because that water vapor is going to compete.

616
01:07:14,260 --> 01:07:19,150
Right. For that. Besides. So that decreases capacity.

617
01:07:19,180 --> 01:07:23,020
Silica and alumina affected more or less than charcoal, we think.

618
01:07:27,980 --> 01:07:31,130
But what I said, when you see silicone gel, sometimes more.

619
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:40,350
Yeah. So if Intel is really sensitive to water vapor, that's why it's good in my, you know, a bottle of supplement vitamins.

620
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:44,850
It's always in there floating around because it's good at soaking up the water vapor.

621
01:07:46,620 --> 01:07:51,690
If there's more Coke and ten contaminants, do we think there's more or less container capacity?

622
01:07:54,400 --> 01:08:00,880
Last year for the same reason. It's going to it's going to compete like the water vapor mass, more absorbent.

623
01:08:03,670 --> 01:08:07,630
Does that increase or decrease? Capacity.

624
01:08:11,730 --> 01:08:18,450
And yeah, you're going to have more available, more binding sites, basically the more assortment you have available.

625
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:25,560
And then surface area, more or less more surface area equals more surface area is good.

626
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:29,940
The more surface area, the more opportunity to interact. So.

627
01:08:30,510 --> 01:08:39,740
So. Yeah. Increases. So. If you talk them through a well and make sense, it's just, you know, keep this in mind.

628
01:08:40,060 --> 01:08:43,670
The star of this one. You know what I mean?

629
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:49,720
Catch my drift. All right. Just a few minutes left here.

630
01:08:49,730 --> 01:08:53,420
So we're going to talk for a moment about the selection efficiencies we talked about.

631
01:08:54,080 --> 01:09:00,830
You have your sample, you collect it over amount of time and then we send it or we have our lab or we send it to a

632
01:09:00,830 --> 01:09:06,170
lab where we use solvents to try to get that contaminant back out of that sorbent material.

633
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:12,470
It's rare that we were able to get 100% of it back out. It's it's a form of recovery.

634
01:09:12,710 --> 01:09:19,310
Recovery, really. So the description of efficiency is an important thing to know going in as well with the method so that

635
01:09:19,330 --> 01:09:25,510
the desertion efficiency is equal to the mass recovered over the mass absorbed adsorbed times of 100.

636
01:09:26,450 --> 01:09:31,579
So this is something you want to keep in mind when you're determining how long you need to collect the sample or what flow rate.

637
01:09:31,580 --> 01:09:38,720
If you have options for a range, you have to account for that to try to make sure you get a detectable sample.

638
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:44,970
Because basically, you know, you're not going to get 100% of what's collected.

639
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:49,590
So there's a basic equation to do that.

640
01:09:49,590 --> 01:09:53,430
So if you're planning to use an analyzer to quantify the amount of starting to

641
01:09:53,430 --> 01:09:57,630
capture on a charcoal tube sampler had a detection limit of 17 micrograms.

642
01:09:58,410 --> 01:10:02,880
How much styrene would you need to collect if the consumption efficiency was 85%?

643
01:10:05,470 --> 01:10:12,380
What do you guys think? So we have 85% DV.

644
01:10:15,780 --> 01:10:21,510
17 is what we need. So beyond our numerator, you're right.

645
01:10:22,410 --> 01:10:28,020
So we solve for mass absorbed so that over.

646
01:10:28,260 --> 01:10:34,860
So we have mass absorbed over our D. So it would be 17 divided by 25, right?

647
01:10:37,260 --> 01:10:40,760
20 micrograms. Okay.

648
01:10:42,690 --> 01:10:46,320
So fairly simple, but it can't get confusing.

649
01:10:46,410 --> 01:10:50,010
Which one is the numerator in the down here? Let's talk it through.

650
01:10:50,430 --> 01:10:55,050
If the air concentration of starting with 20 milligrams per cubic meter, what volume of air would be required?

651
01:10:56,430 --> 01:11:06,050
It's getting tricky by changing the unit size. All we do is I think you guys do this, but I'll show you.

652
01:11:06,970 --> 01:11:15,940
Basically, it's it's just playing with the units here. So it's a thousand micrograms, a milligram and a thousand liters in a cubic meter.

653
01:11:16,270 --> 01:11:23,140
So it ends up being just one liter. If you.

654
01:11:25,490 --> 01:11:29,300
Increase the number, the volume will be less.

655
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:37,770
With that numbers decrease, the volume would be increased. Right. For an eight hour workday would be the required flow rate.

656
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:44,580
We need a collective a leader over the course of 8 hours.

657
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:55,010
So we're going to divide one leader by 8 hours or one leader by 480 minutes, and you get 2.1 liters per minute.

658
01:11:55,350 --> 01:11:56,940
That's a very low flow rate.

659
01:11:57,180 --> 01:12:04,200
But again, with gas and vapors, sometimes you want that low flow rate to increase the interaction time with the collection.

660
01:12:10,690 --> 01:12:13,810
Everybody get on that. All right.

661
01:12:15,130 --> 01:12:23,350
An alternative to solvent absorption is thermal absorption so that some of these newer synthetic absorbance they're deficient

662
01:12:23,350 --> 01:12:31,240
in the desorption efficiency is much higher because they just heat it up and it goes straight to a GC or something.

663
01:12:32,740 --> 01:12:35,230
However, it's not possible for all analytes.

664
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:43,060
For example, if something gets transformed to a high temperature, it's not a good candidate for thermal desorption.

665
01:12:43,300 --> 01:12:47,060
So it's used for some things, but. But not everything. For.
