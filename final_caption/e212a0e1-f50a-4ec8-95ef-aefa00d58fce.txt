1
00:01:46,174 --> 00:02:00,174
queue to do this now, right it has been enabled, and then I've also used this slide to let my participants know how they can participate.

2
00:02:00,174 --> 00:02:05,174
How I want them to ask questions, unmute mic reminder that this will be on the recording.

3
00:02:05,174 --> 00:02:22,174
Use the chat and personally for me I discourage my Zoom meeting participants from using the raise hand under the reactions, just because when i'm screen sharing, That's really hard for me to see it only displays in the

4
00:02:22,174 --> 00:02:27,174
participant list or on the video preview or user window.

5
00:02:27,174 --> 00:02:35,174
When i'm looking at the screen in gallery view and so those are really easy to miss.

6
00:02:35,174 --> 00:02:54,174
So one of my first tips for teaching online with zoom would be to let your participants know how you want them to engage, and even if it changes throughout, you can insert different slides for different phases, of your class if there's

7
00:02:54,174 --> 00:03:00,174
1 point that is lecture focused. maybe it's hold your questions until

8
00:03:00,174 --> 00:03:04,174
I ask for questions, and then I can have a slide in there specifically.

9
00:03:04,174 --> 00:03:15,174
To Alright, what questions can I answer? And so, letting your participants know how you would like for them to participate is helpful for them to know.

10
00:03:15,174 --> 00:03:18,174
And it goes to that sort of transparency aspect.

11
00:03:18,174 --> 00:03:31,174
We talked about earlier this morning. in the resilient teaching session

12
00:03:31,174 --> 00:03:44,174
So So you may have seen in the panopto session that we want to touch on privacy and secure data when we're recording classroom activities.

13
00:03:44,174 --> 00:03:53,174
And so, whether this is in person, in Panopo or recording Zoom class meetings, these are considered classroom activities.

14
00:03:53,174 --> 00:04:03,174
They are part of the core course record, and they are part of the Furba secure data category.

15
00:04:03,174 --> 00:04:08,174
So it has a guide for recording classroom activities.

16
00:04:08,174 --> 00:04:26,174
They provide some syllabus language about what students should know about recording and letting them know that this is only being shared with other members of the class, but also setting expectations of you are not allowed to record or snapchat and

17
00:04:26,174 --> 00:04:44,174
share portions of our zoom class meetings with others outside of the class. And so there's some helpful language there on this website which i'll share out at the end of our event today.

18
00:04:44,174 --> 00:04:49,174
So some other items are when you're in zoom and someone else is screen sharing.

19
00:04:49,174 --> 00:04:54,174
You have the ability to adjust your view so at the top of your screen.

20
00:04:54,174 --> 00:05:04,174
There's typically a green bar, notifying you whose screen your viewing. and next to that is a drop-down menu of view options.

21
00:05:04,174 --> 00:05:11,174
And so sometimes there are some defaults, if zoom may be opening up full screen.

22
00:05:11,174 --> 00:05:31,174
Or and you can zoom in or zoom out to make your view more comfortable, which is also a tip that you can share with your participants, so that they know how the you best adjust their view.

23
00:05:31,174 --> 00:05:38,174
Alright. so the agenda for this session is basically to just go over some zoom basics.

24
00:05:38,174 --> 00:05:44,174
We're going to talk about scheduling zoom sessions in canvas.

25
00:05:44,174 --> 00:05:51,174
We're going to talk about some of the zoom tools and how to incorporate engagement into your Zoom sessions.

26
00:05:51,174 --> 00:05:58,174
And then I want to touch briefly on publishing an archiving zoom recordings.

27
00:05:58,174 --> 00:06:10,174
Monica rosen is here and she's going to jump in and help out if there's anything on any of these topics to add, If there are any tools that you specifically want us to focus on that you're most interested

28
00:06:10,174 --> 00:06:21,174
in that we cover. Please feel to drop, feel free to drop that in the chat, so we can make sure we incorporate it

29
00:06:21,174 --> 00:06:40,174
One of the basics is You wanna use the zoom application, so I would encourage you to download and install the zoom app on your computer as opposed to joining in over the browser when you download

30
00:06:40,174 --> 00:06:48,174
zoom you can sign in. You want to use the sign in with sso option.

31
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:53,174
This is gonna allow you to use your U Mish account to sign into zoom.

32
00:06:53,174 --> 00:06:56,174
This is also there's a couple of things that are gonna happen here.

33
00:06:56,174 --> 00:07:03,174
One when you sign in with Sso. it automatically allows you to log in with your humish account.

34
00:07:03,174 --> 00:07:09,174
As I mentioned, it's also going to allow you to access classes or any zoom meetings.

35
00:07:09,174 --> 00:07:14,174
If someone has restricted it to authenticated users only.

36
00:07:14,174 --> 00:07:30,174
So there may be cases where, as a security measure and instructor, or maybe someone else you meet with in the organization, an advisor has put a security measure on their Zoom meeting, saying, only authenticated U. of M.

37
00:07:30,174 --> 00:07:38,174
Users can join this meeting. This is also gonna help you.

38
00:07:38,174 --> 00:07:43,174
When you encourage your students and participants to sign in with Sso.

39
00:07:43,174 --> 00:07:52,174
This is gonna help you leverage a tool available for breakout rooms, which is called Pre assigned breakout rooms.

40
00:07:52,174 --> 00:07:57,174
It allows you to designate which students should be in which breakout rooms.

41
00:07:57,174 --> 00:08:03,174
But the only way Zoom knows who they are is if they're logged in with their yumish account.

42
00:08:03,174 --> 00:08:12,174
So that can either go really smoothly or become really messy depending on how many people sign in properly.

43
00:08:12,174 --> 00:08:19,174
Luckily it's easy to tell who is signed in at least from your host and Co-host view.

44
00:08:19,174 --> 00:08:30,174
You can see if anyone has has like guessed next to their name, which indicates they are not signed in with you of them

45
00:08:30,174 --> 00:08:33,174
Alright. So that was a long explanation to say, Click!

46
00:08:33,174 --> 00:08:43,174
Sign in with Sso. and then when it asks you for your company domain, you can enter you mish that's gonna take you to the U.

47
00:08:43,174 --> 00:08:54,174
Of M. Login Page, the web login page similar to when you log into canvas or your email

48
00:08:54,174 --> 00:09:04,174
So, in addition to using the app check the version, if you already have it installed, You're gonna want to make sure you keep it up to date, and particularly with the semester.

49
00:09:04,174 --> 00:09:08,174
Starting, you want to make sure you have the newest version.

50
00:09:08,174 --> 00:09:16,174
So 5 dot 11 is the newest version, and mine just had an update this past Friday.

51
00:09:16,174 --> 00:09:26,174
So I think mine is on 5 dot 11 dot 9 so if you're in the 5 11 you're in a good place.

52
00:09:26,174 --> 00:09:34,174
You can see what version your app is in by clicking on the profile in the upper right corner of your zoom.

53
00:09:34,174 --> 00:09:55,174
App going down to the help menu, and clicking about zoom. So if you're a few versions behind, you may want to go, or Google zoom download, and i'll try to provide that link in my follow up add that to my

54
00:09:55,174 --> 00:09:58,174
notes.

55
00:09:58,174 --> 00:10:04,174
So that you are up to date and ready for the new semester.

56
00:10:04,174 --> 00:10:19,174
And when they release these updates their security features but there's also interactive and new features that they release that you can take advantage of

57
00:10:19,174 --> 00:10:27,174
So we will jump right into scheduling your zoom meetings in your canvas site.

58
00:10:27,174 --> 00:10:32,174
So you should have a zoom. menu if you don't have one already.

59
00:10:32,174 --> 00:10:48,174
When you click on the zoom, menu, you may, There may be an authorized step, and that may be a couple of click authorized step. And so, depending on whether you or the faculty member are scheduling the meetings, you can

60
00:10:48,174 --> 00:10:55,174
click the schedule A new meeting set assignment.

61
00:10:55,174 --> 00:11:03,174
Security setting on your meetings a pass code or waiting room or another.

62
00:11:03,174 --> 00:11:09,174
One of those is authenticated users only.

63
00:11:09,174 --> 00:11:21,174
We would suggest sending those to automatically record. but whatever you were, the faculty wanna do is fine recording them will benefit any students who may not have been able to attend.

64
00:11:21,174 --> 00:11:30,174
But instructors may have different preferences about how a student makes up work for missing class.

65
00:11:30,174 --> 00:11:38,174
Then this slide was designed. If a Gsi is scheduling meetings, you would add the faculty member as an alternative host.

66
00:11:38,174 --> 00:11:51,174
And what that does is it allows whichever one of you joins the meeting. First, to have a host capability, and whoever at joins second will be a co-host.

67
00:11:51,174 --> 00:11:59,174
So you both get some hosting capabilities. So I want to just look at how to go through that.

68
00:11:59,174 --> 00:12:02,174
So, for most courses zoom will be in the course.

69
00:12:02,174 --> 00:12:09,174
Navigation. menu, however, if it's not that can easily be added from the settings.

70
00:12:09,174 --> 00:12:18,174
Menu which is always the last menu item you'd go to the navigation.

71
00:12:18,174 --> 00:12:25,174
It's scroll down and locate zoom in the second set of tools.

72
00:12:25,174 --> 00:12:39,174
Click the 3 dots, and enable that's going to move it up to the active tools where you can move it around, depending on how much it is going to be used in your course.

73
00:12:39,174 --> 00:12:47,174
If this is how your class is meeting every class you'll you may want to move it up to the top.

74
00:12:47,174 --> 00:13:01,174
If Zoom is in your course, menu and you're not using it at all, you can disable it, because you can always make it available later, and I would only recommend scheduling meetings through the zoom Canvas

75
00:13:01,174 --> 00:13:07,174
menu that you want students to join remotely.

76
00:13:07,174 --> 00:13:14,174
In the case of if your class is meeting in person, and you have guest speakers joining over zoom.

77
00:13:14,174 --> 00:13:20,174
If you still want the students to come to class, I would say schedule.

78
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:35,174
The Zoom meeting outside of canvas, and only share the link with the guest speaker, because anything you schedule here in the Zoom Menu students are going to assume that they can just join remotely and not come

79
00:13:35,174 --> 00:13:47,174
to class in person. if you change anything on this page you'll want to go down to the very bottom and click save to lock it in.

80
00:13:47,174 --> 00:14:02,174
I won't save my changes i'm gonna return to home, and i'm gonna click on the Zoom meeting. so I've used zoom in canvas before, and so it didn't give me that authorized step but you may see something

81
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:06,174
like that and it's okay to authorize it what it's doing is linking your you Mish zoom account with your U.

82
00:14:06,174 --> 00:14:13,174
Of M. Canvas account

83
00:14:13,174 --> 00:14:18,174
So we see upcoming meetings previous meetings so as a semester goes on meetings.

84
00:14:18,174 --> 00:14:24,174
You've had in the past will be listed here personal meeting room.

85
00:14:24,174 --> 00:14:31,174
This meeting information will be different, depending on who is looking at this page and cloud recordings.

86
00:14:31,174 --> 00:14:38,174
Your recordings are going to organize in a list under this tab.

87
00:14:38,174 --> 00:14:54,174
So if I come to upcoming meetings i'm ready to schedule a new meeting, and I can name it whatever i'd like, you know, class meetings fall 2022

88
00:14:54,174 --> 00:15:00,174
Set the date of the first meeting, the date, and the time of the first meeting.

89
00:15:00,174 --> 00:15:03,174
How long does the class meet? an hour hour and a half?

90
00:15:03,174 --> 00:15:16,174
More than that. If it's a recurring meeting that happens every Monday, you can set it to recur weekly every week.

91
00:15:16,174 --> 00:15:25,174
Monday, or whatever days of the week it meets, and then end date, would be every Monday until the end of the semester.

92
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:35,174
So sometime. Oh, whoops! I hit the year

93
00:15:35,174 --> 00:15:39,174
That's

94
00:15:39,174 --> 00:15:48,174
That was not very intuitive. Alright, there we go, the inner one.

95
00:15:48,174 --> 00:15:55,174
So I wanted to go to December

96
00:15:55,174 --> 00:16:01,174
I like to add a little bit of overlap so our glass class meeting is on the fifth on mondays.

97
00:16:01,174 --> 00:16:07,174
I'm gonna set it to be tuesday. sometimes I feel like it drops off that last meeting.

98
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:13,174
If you don't get it quite right so likely for a class you're not going to require registration.

99
00:16:13,174 --> 00:16:22,174
That's typically reserved for things like events where you want to know who's coming.

100
00:16:22,174 --> 00:16:27,174
I have my zoom account set to default to setting a passcode.

101
00:16:27,174 --> 00:16:33,174
Yours may default to using waiting room, and so you can set it up.

102
00:16:33,174 --> 00:16:47,174
However, you would like I like the waiting room I mean i'm sorry I like the pass code, because once i'm screen sharing and teaching, and in a session it's a lot harder for me to pay attention to

103
00:16:47,174 --> 00:17:04,174
those requests that somebody's in the waiting room somebody needs to be led in and particularly, you know, if somebody happens to drop off their Internet connection cuts out briefly and they need to rejoin that could be a little

104
00:17:04,174 --> 00:17:22,174
disruptive. so you can name that whatever you'd like I would also say, Whatever your pass code is, come up here and add it to your description.

105
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:26,174
Just so there's no question about that you've provided that information to students.

106
00:17:26,174 --> 00:17:38,174
There's no confusion over that. and then every once in a while, particularly maybe, if you decide to incorporate pre-assigned breakout rooms, and you need students to be logged into their U. of M.

107
00:17:38,174 --> 00:17:53,174
Account. Say, if it's a really large class it it's not a bad idea to decide that to only authenticated users can join what I would do if that setting is being used is let students know you need to log in

108
00:17:53,174 --> 00:18:00,174
to your U. of M. account. here's how if you need help getting that language together.

109
00:18:00,174 --> 00:18:12,174
We would be happy to help provide that to direct them where they need to go. How they need to sign in sharing that Sso option.

110
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:18,174
So Video: a lot of our classes allow for participants and hosts to share video audio.

111
00:18:18,174 --> 00:18:22,174
We try to be flexible that people can call in

112
00:18:22,174 --> 00:18:30,174
In addition to joining over a computer mobile device, and then additional meetings.

113
00:18:30,174 --> 00:18:33,174
Do you want students to be able to join before a host?

114
00:18:33,174 --> 00:18:55,174
My only caution about this is this: If you have at the meeting set to record automatically anytime, someone pops into the meeting, maybe even just to test the link to make sure that they can get in before the first class meeting or maybe they

115
00:18:55,174 --> 00:19:07,174
just updated their computer and they just want to make sure that they can get into the class that's gonna generate a recording, which means whoever the host is, they're going to get a notification of your your recording is ready to view

116
00:19:07,174 --> 00:19:18,174
or your recording is ready to share. So I would just say sometimes that one takes a little bit more thought.

117
00:19:18,174 --> 00:19:24,174
I tend to not use these 2 together so Maybe they can join early, and I won't automatically.

118
00:19:24,174 --> 00:19:40,174
Record i'll start the recording when i'm ready or vice versa. muting participants on entry. Not a bad idea, particularly as students are just logging in. they're getting settled sometimes they're rattling

119
00:19:40,174 --> 00:19:43,174
their papers. Their laptop is shuffling around.

120
00:19:43,174 --> 00:19:50,174
It gives them a time to get settled without the whole class, and all of us having to hear all of that sound.

121
00:19:50,174 --> 00:19:53,174
They're putting the dog out into another room they're telling everybody all right.

122
00:19:53,174 --> 00:20:00,174
I'm joining class breakout room pre assigned This is that option.

123
00:20:00,174 --> 00:20:07,174
You can preset groups that you can use while you're live in the zoom.

124
00:20:07,174 --> 00:20:14,174
Session, and then record the meeting automatically. here's that option to add alternative hosts.

125
00:20:14,174 --> 00:20:25,174
If there are other Gsis or Tas or other co-teachers teaching team members that need to be on here.

126
00:20:25,174 --> 00:20:30,174
Anyone who you would be giving co-host capability to you can and invite them.

127
00:20:30,174 --> 00:20:36,174
Here. However, they have to. This has to be a youish email address.

128
00:20:36,174 --> 00:20:41,174
To preset them as an alternative host once you're in the meeting.

129
00:20:41,174 --> 00:20:50,174
You can promote anyone to a co-host. but to do that in advance where they automatically have that as soon as they log in it has to be a U of M.

130
00:20:50,174 --> 00:20:54,174
Account. So again, if they are not signed into their u of M.

131
00:20:54,174 --> 00:21:02,174
Zoom account they won't log in with that access

132
00:21:02,174 --> 00:21:09,174
All right, so I just saved this meeting, and now I have the option.

133
00:21:09,174 --> 00:21:22,174
If I wanted to, I could start creating polls the issue Here is this canvas area allows you to only add poles using their Csv Template.

134
00:21:22,174 --> 00:21:30,174
It's much easier to actually add poles in the web interface. so i'll show that a little bit later.

135
00:21:30,174 --> 00:21:40,174
But let's keep looking at the Canvas items. so now I could add this to my Google calendar, so that it is on my or outlook.

136
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:48,174
Or Yahoo. However, I track just so that I have this saved to my calendar.

137
00:21:48,174 --> 00:22:00,174
When I back up to course meetings I now have all of my upcoming meetings coming up. and then on the Class Meeting Day, I could return here.

138
00:22:00,174 --> 00:22:06,174
You'll also want to direct your students that this is how they can join the Zoom meetings.

139
00:22:06,174 --> 00:22:11,174
Come to the Zoom Menu they're gonna have a button that says join.

140
00:22:11,174 --> 00:22:28,174
They Won't have the delete button and hosts and co-hosts have the start button

141
00:22:28,174 --> 00:22:33,174
Once you start your meeting again. if you have other alternative hosts.

142
00:22:33,174 --> 00:22:43,174
Your menus may look slightly different, depending on whether you're a host or co-host and the participant list will tell you which you are.

143
00:22:43,174 --> 00:23:04,174
If you're in there as a coast or co-host. I think for the most part these the settings are pretty self-explanatory, and really easy to explore on your own a couple of things I covered over

144
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:07,174
here that are here on the left, and you can see that in your zoom controls.

145
00:23:07,174 --> 00:23:20,174
Now is the audio and video. but you can always turn your video on and off, using those buttons that are located on the far left.

146
00:23:20,174 --> 00:23:27,174
A host has a security Menu! actually let me go ahead and go to the next slide which compares.

147
00:23:27,174 --> 00:23:36,174
The Host and Co-host Zoom has done a good job of mostly aligning these to be almost the same.

148
00:23:36,174 --> 00:23:42,174
The main difference is the live transcript option.

149
00:23:42,174 --> 00:23:49,174
The last I checked that still resides with just the host.

150
00:23:49,174 --> 00:23:55,174
But I I could be wrong, and students sorry part participants.

151
00:23:55,174 --> 00:24:00,174
So anyone in the student role does have this button visible.

152
00:24:00,174 --> 00:24:14,174
But participants can click on it and they can request it'll send a request to the host to enable asking to enable live transcript which is a really nice feature, because sometimes, as a host, we forget to turn it

153
00:24:14,174 --> 00:24:19,174
on, and then someone in the audience can prompt us.

154
00:24:19,174 --> 00:24:26,174
And it even gives the option to ask anonymously in case someone's not doesn't feel comfortable.

155
00:24:26,174 --> 00:24:39,174
Having their name attached to that request. but security has some interesting features just to be aware of during your meeting, and I have those on another slide participants opens a panel.

156
00:24:39,174 --> 00:24:44,174
So you can see who is in the meeting at any time, and what roles.

157
00:24:44,174 --> 00:24:48,174
And this is how you would see if there's anyone with a guest next to their name.

158
00:24:48,174 --> 00:24:56,174
So you know they're not logged in you can also see who has their audio and video enabled.

159
00:24:56,174 --> 00:24:59,174
You can also see a summary of gestures.

160
00:24:59,174 --> 00:25:12,174
The reactions in the participants list. The chat allows you to chat, and as a host and a co-host you can actually control who can chat.

161
00:25:12,174 --> 00:25:19,174
Let me pull that up real quick i'm gonna put this put my chat window.

162
00:25:19,174 --> 00:25:35,174
And so every once in a while we might be doing something over zoom, such as taking an exam together, or taking some time to write or things you don't want students communicating these 3 dots right here.

163
00:25:35,174 --> 00:25:46,174
Give me more options. How chat can be used in this meeting? So I can set participants, can chat with no one.

164
00:25:46,174 --> 00:25:53,174
Host and co-host only everyone or everyone and anyone directly.

165
00:25:53,174 --> 00:25:59,174
So this means I can chat with everyone publicly, or I can send private chats.

166
00:25:59,174 --> 00:26:06,174
So in the cases where instructors been using zoom to sort of unofficially proctor, an exam.

167
00:26:06,174 --> 00:26:17,174
We've set that to no one so that students can't chat at all, although I don't really recommend setting it to no one.

168
00:26:17,174 --> 00:26:26,174
I would say, send it to host and co-host, so that they can always communicate with you

169
00:26:26,174 --> 00:26:35,174
I'm gonna set that back to everyone so there's some interesting restrictions that can be used under chat screen share.

170
00:26:35,174 --> 00:26:46,174
We're going to talk more about polling is how pulling is really used to present polls that you've created

171
00:26:46,174 --> 00:26:53,174
You would need to create those poles beforehand.

172
00:26:53,174 --> 00:26:56,174
You can create them on the fly, but it does take a few minutes.

173
00:26:56,174 --> 00:27:06,174
So. but if something happens live during the session, an instructor says something, and you think, oh, maybe I can go make a poll that can get a little tricky.

174
00:27:06,174 --> 00:27:23,174
I think it would depend on whether you're the host of the meeting, or whether, if you're an alternative host who has been given the ability to create polls about whether you could sort of build a poll in the background while an

175
00:27:23,174 --> 00:27:34,174
Instructor's teaching and use it later. One Nice thing is Zoom now allows you to save polls and reuse them over and over.

176
00:27:34,174 --> 00:27:41,174
This used to not be the case, and so you would have to recreate poles every time you wanted to use them in every meeting.

177
00:27:41,174 --> 00:27:56,174
But thankfully, that has changed. So if you, if there are some that you want to keep on deck and use over and over again. you can record is how you start and stop the recording.

178
00:27:56,174 --> 00:28:04,174
Now note that participants also have this record. button but it's gonna tell them you don't have permission to record this.

179
00:28:04,174 --> 00:28:10,174
You're gonna have to request permission to record so as a host.

180
00:28:10,174 --> 00:28:21,174
I have live transcript next as a co-host breakout rooms is next, And so this is how I manage dividing students up into groups, and there's a lot of options there.

181
00:28:21,174 --> 00:28:28,174
And then reactions, reactions are a great way to see if everyone's on the same page.

182
00:28:28,174 --> 00:28:41,174
Or let me know when you've completed this step just informal polls or headcounts about something specific, you know.

183
00:28:41,174 --> 00:28:46,174
Work on this problem, and then we'll come and compare answers.

184
00:28:46,174 --> 00:29:02,174
So use, you know. raise your hand when you've completed the problem, so that we know when everyone's done just informal off the cuff questions like that

185
00:29:02,174 --> 00:29:08,174
I'm gonna look up briefly at the options that are available under the security button.

186
00:29:08,174 --> 00:29:19,174
And this was really created out of the sort of zoom bombing effect that happened during the pandemic but it's got some really helpful features that we can use in certain scenarios where we want to sort

187
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:36,174
of manage our meeting a little tighter particularly in the case of if we're proctoring an exam over zoom the first one is, you can lock the meeting, you know, Once everyone is in or maybe you have a deadline you need to

188
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:39,174
be in the meeting by this time or you're getting locked out.

189
00:29:39,174 --> 00:29:46,174
Basically you can prevent anyone from joining the meeting. Once you lock it, you can enable a waiting room.

190
00:29:46,174 --> 00:29:51,174
So this can be really helpful if you're using zoom for office hours.

191
00:29:51,174 --> 00:30:00,174
You can start your meeting, Turn the waiting room on, and then let students in one at a time, so you can meet one on one with them.

192
00:30:00,174 --> 00:30:08,174
Zoom will keep the order of students in the order that they joined, so that you can let them in.

193
00:30:08,174 --> 00:30:16,174
You also have the ability to send message, chat messages to those that are waiting in the waiting room.

194
00:30:16,174 --> 00:30:32,174
You can hide profile pictures if you'd like here's also some bulk sort of participant settings that you can enable quickly from the security menu you can enable or disable park participants ability to

195
00:30:32,174 --> 00:30:42,174
screen share, to chat their ability to rename themselves, unmute themselves, or start their video.

196
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:46,174
So again in the case where we've proctored some exams over zoom.

197
00:30:46,174 --> 00:30:52,174
We've had this set to where you can't unmute yourself. Just so.

198
00:30:52,174 --> 00:31:01,174
Nobody accidentally unmutes and starts making noise that's going to be distracting the other students, and then we didn't want to completely disable chat.

199
00:31:01,174 --> 00:31:14,174
We just wanted to restrict it to instructor only host only

200
00:31:14,174 --> 00:31:25,174
I want to talk a little bit about screen sharing cause There's several options with screensharing that are pretty interesting right now.

201
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:48,174
When I initiated screen share for this I just did my full screen. And so if I move this off here and bring something else up, you'll be able to see that anything I open any program or anything I move on to this screen you'll be able to see

202
00:31:48,174 --> 00:31:55,174
it but I can also just restrict this to just the chrome browser.

203
00:31:55,174 --> 00:31:59,174
And so you wouldn't see my my desktop screen behind here.

204
00:31:59,174 --> 00:32:12,174
If I wasn't sharing my entire desktop one neat tool is Powerpoint slides as zoom background.

205
00:32:12,174 --> 00:32:18,174
So i'm gonna see if I can do this without stopping.

206
00:32:18,174 --> 00:32:26,174
So i'm currently sharing my my screen and i'm gonna click new share.

207
00:32:26,174 --> 00:32:32,174
And so here's all the options that what I can share all the different windows, I have open in the background.

208
00:32:32,174 --> 00:32:42,174
But i'm gonna come over to the advanced Oh, you know what I don't know if I have a powerpoint ready.

209
00:32:42,174 --> 00:32:56,174
Let me see if I have a powerpoint

210
00:32:56,174 --> 00:33:04,174
Let me cancel and download this Powerpoint real, quick

211
00:33:04,174 --> 00:33:23,174
So when you are using pptx there's a kind of fun feature that's available alright alright, so that has downloaded, we're gonna do new share again.

212
00:33:23,174 --> 00:33:36,174
Advance tab, and we're going to say slides as virtual background and share.

213
00:33:36,174 --> 00:33:55,174
So it's gonna allow me to locate that slide deck. Oh, boy, I think these are in health, but a quarter

214
00:33:55,174 --> 00:34:05,174
There we go open

215
00:34:05,174 --> 00:34:26,174
So if you one moment it should be preparing to load these slides

216
00:34:26,174 --> 00:34:31,174
Alright.

217
00:34:31,174 --> 00:34:36,174
And i'll relocate my application of that

218
00:34:36,174 --> 00:34:40,174
So this slides of virtual background is a completely different screen.

219
00:34:40,174 --> 00:34:45,174
Sharing experience. What it has done is basically imported.

220
00:34:45,174 --> 00:34:58,174
My slides, and I can control them from the bottom here. Oops Let me hide my subtitle because it's covering up.

221
00:34:58,174 --> 00:35:03,174
I can switch my slides from the bottom of my screen.

222
00:35:03,174 --> 00:35:07,174
You may not be able to see that but it's giving me a little next slide.

223
00:35:07,174 --> 00:35:24,174
Now slide button in the bottom center, and as you can see it has inserted me into the bottom corner, and what's nice is that at the top of my screen I can see all of the student webcams so if

224
00:35:24,174 --> 00:35:33,174
students, I would be able to see them a little bit better than I can when i'm using the standard screen share.

225
00:35:33,174 --> 00:35:41,174
I have the ability to maybe move my myself to a different location.

226
00:35:41,174 --> 00:35:55,174
I could put myself up at the top, and I can also make myself a little smaller or larger

227
00:35:55,174 --> 00:36:02,174
So I would be able to go through my presentation

228
00:36:02,174 --> 00:36:12,174
And sort of be this little video window in the side so I will say this doesn't get picked up in the recording the recording

229
00:36:12,174 --> 00:36:20,174
The last I checked is going to record these slides and then record me in a separate window.

230
00:36:20,174 --> 00:36:24,174
But what I like about this view is that I have my toolbar at the bottom.

231
00:36:24,174 --> 00:36:30,174
I don't have to deal with that floating toolbar that's covering my windows.

232
00:36:30,174 --> 00:36:41,174
However, this doesn't work with standard screen share if I need to demonstrate something on canvas or pull up a different program on my computer.

233
00:36:41,174 --> 00:36:56,174
This only works with a powerpoint, maybe keynote on Mac

234
00:36:56,174 --> 00:37:07,174
I'm going to reinstate my full screen sharing and talking about a single screen management.

235
00:37:07,174 --> 00:37:17,174
So right now I have dual screens. and it can be a little tricky when you're on a single screen to manage all the windows you need to manage with zoom.

236
00:37:17,174 --> 00:37:33,174
So I have this floating toolbar. I want to pop this chat box out so that I can see if anyone is chatting or has a question.

237
00:37:33,174 --> 00:37:44,174
And so this can get a little tough. So I want to show you a strategy that I use, and that is this works well.

238
00:37:44,174 --> 00:37:53,174
If i'm doing something in a browser or even powerpoint on my computer.

239
00:37:53,174 --> 00:38:14,174
So i'm gonna organize my screen like this and then i'm gonna do a new share, and only show my chrome tab

240
00:38:14,174 --> 00:38:24,174
So now that's gonna zoom in on what I want you to see, and I can see to my zoom window.

241
00:38:24,174 --> 00:38:36,174
But now you can't see those additional menus in the chat box that I have organized on my screen, so it gives me the ability to position these in a way that's comfortable.

242
00:38:36,174 --> 00:38:45,174
And only share a portion of my screen, so that I can use the rest of the screen space.

243
00:38:45,174 --> 00:38:51,174
For all the zoom business

244
00:38:51,174 --> 00:38:59,174
Zoom now off allows you to share 2 breakout rooms, so let me do a new share.

245
00:38:59,174 --> 00:39:06,174
I'm gonna put us back on the full desktop

246
00:39:06,174 --> 00:39:15,174
When I come to breakout rooms

247
00:39:15,174 --> 00:39:19,174
I have the ability to assign automatically assign manually.

248
00:39:19,174 --> 00:39:28,174
If I know what students I want, and what groups, or I can let participants choose a room.

249
00:39:28,174 --> 00:39:40,174
If I had pre-assigned breakout rooms, it would immediately take me to those, and I could launch those or I could reset them

250
00:39:40,174 --> 00:39:51,174
And so let me see. Yeah. So there is a checkbox that appears.

251
00:39:51,174 --> 00:39:57,174
I lost my stop light when you screen share there's a couple of options.

252
00:39:57,174 --> 00:40:03,174
Here share your sound optimize for a video clip and when breakout rooms are open.

253
00:40:03,174 --> 00:40:10,174
There's a checkbox here that says share to breakout rooms

254
00:40:10,174 --> 00:40:27,174
And so that is helpful. If in the case that I need to send students to breakout rooms and discuss something. Go to the breakout room and talk about this.

255
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:39,174
What's the impact of something? What method would you use and a lot of times when I get into a breakout room, my first question is,

256
00:40:39,174 --> 00:40:56,174
Does anybody remember what we're supposed to be talking about it's? a very common reaction to going from large group discussion the small group discussion, and so I could send this broadcast this slide to the breakout rooms to refresh their memory of

257
00:40:56,174 --> 00:41:07,174
here's what you should be talking about so this is a nice new feature that's available, and then annotation.

258
00:41:07,174 --> 00:41:15,174
I would love to talk about annotation, so the floating toolbar, for the zoom tools has an annotate menu, and it's on my other screen.

259
00:41:15,174 --> 00:41:21,174
So let me bring it up here

260
00:41:21,174 --> 00:41:28,174
Oops. I excellent hit the draw

261
00:41:28,174 --> 00:41:43,174
I'll show you my favorite tools are under this spotlight So the spotlight this is my laser pointer that I've been using during the session, and it allows me to put it and bring the participants

262
00:41:43,174 --> 00:41:59,174
focus and attention to what I want them to look at so I could put that on a bullet point, so they know where I am on the slide, or, as we saw in some of the demo they can follow it to see where i'm looking

263
00:41:59,174 --> 00:42:10,174
at the other. Option is an arrow. One nice thing is that I use this arrow a lot when someone else is screen sharing.

264
00:42:10,174 --> 00:42:21,174
So some people have their meetings set up to allow annotation, when someone else, when you're not sharing.

265
00:42:21,174 --> 00:42:32,174
And so this is and I believe that's available by default and so i'm able to take advantage of that when i'm showing people how to do something i'll have them share their screen i'll grab this

266
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:40,174
arrow and i'll drop it where I want them to look

267
00:42:40,174 --> 00:42:55,174
Particularly when i'm doing something in canvas I need to switch it back to my mouse, so that I can have control, and then go back to my arrow, particularly if I need to come here and I say go to the assignments.

268
00:42:55,174 --> 00:43:07,174
Button, or return to home. So you'll find that buried under that view options, it should be displaying at the top of your screen.

269
00:43:07,174 --> 00:43:18,174
Next to that year, seeing the host screen there's a view options, and it may give you the ability to annotate, I go back and forth between turning that on and off.

270
00:43:18,174 --> 00:43:27,174
But I think I have it on at the moment feel free to play with that and then vanishing.

271
00:43:27,174 --> 00:43:45,174
Pen is also nice. Let me go to my mouse so that I can switch my tab vanishing pen is nice because I can bring attention to something, and it'll just disappear on its own.

272
00:43:45,174 --> 00:44:06,174
If I were using the drawing tool that's going to stay there until I erase it, either using the eraser tool, or, if I clear the drawings, almost screen

273
00:44:06,174 --> 00:44:20,174
So annotation has some nice features that can help you as you're teaching, and keep focus where you want it

274
00:44:20,174 --> 00:44:26,174
As I mentioned, reactions, is nice for a informal ask of the students.

275
00:44:26,174 --> 00:44:32,174
You may need to direct them to where the reactions menu is.

276
00:44:32,174 --> 00:44:45,174
One quick thing about the reactions menu let's see if I can pull it up here some disappear quickly, and some remain so.

277
00:44:45,174 --> 00:45:00,174
When i'm asking students or zoom participants to let me know something like, let me know when you've completed setup of something, and then we'll move on. I want them to pick one of the the reactions

278
00:45:00,174 --> 00:45:06,174
that's going to stay and hold so I can see when everyone has selected it.

279
00:45:06,174 --> 00:45:15,174
I wouldn't have them use one of these emojis at the top, because those are set to display for maybe like 10 s, and then fade out.

280
00:45:15,174 --> 00:45:33,174
But these the green check is sort of a yes, the red x is a no, and there's a slow down a speed up, and there's an I'm away, and there's a raise hand all of these stay in place until you

281
00:45:33,174 --> 00:45:42,174
manually remove them

282
00:45:42,174 --> 00:45:52,174
Polls and knowledge checks are great for incorporating engagement into your classes, and so you could do that with a zoom, poll.

283
00:45:52,174 --> 00:45:57,174
So I have one here here's one from a session earlier today.

284
00:45:57,174 --> 00:46:06,174
I can launch this poll, ask participants to respond, and then I can end the poll.

285
00:46:06,174 --> 00:46:19,174
And share those results. If I'd like sp also licenses, a tool called pull everywhere where you can incorporate questions that have more open-ended brainstorm, Q.

286
00:46:19,174 --> 00:46:26,174
And a type of questions. Paul everywhere has a very fun.

287
00:46:26,174 --> 00:46:37,174
Competition poll question type. So if you are doing an exam review, you could have students compete against one another, or in teams to answer the questions.

288
00:46:37,174 --> 00:46:42,174
The fastest

289
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:51,174
Again. Breakout rooms are a great way to incorporate engagement, giving students a break from just listening and giving them an opportunity to interact with one another.

290
00:46:51,174 --> 00:46:56,174
They can work on problems together. they can discuss a certain topic.

291
00:46:56,174 --> 00:47:03,174
We just talked about. take a deeper dive into it.

292
00:47:03,174 --> 00:47:10,174
Then you can always have students do brainstorming and collaboration, and Google offers great tools for this.

293
00:47:10,174 --> 00:47:20,174
You could have them work on slides collaboratively, and either answering questions or designing something or brainstorming.

294
00:47:20,174 --> 00:47:30,174
You can also use jam board for this i'll go ahead and open a jam board

295
00:47:30,174 --> 00:47:37,174
It allows sort of like a collaborative whiteboard, with some drawing tools that are a little bit similar to the zoom.

296
00:47:37,174 --> 00:47:43,174
Whiteboard tools, but it allows you to like take notes and categorize things in sticky notes.

297
00:47:43,174 --> 00:48:02,174
So if you've ever been in a class where they've had flip charts around, and you can leave notes and comments and pros and cons, this is another way to incorporate that in a virtual environment.

298
00:48:02,174 --> 00:48:17,174
That may be all I have prepared. I do want to Talk about publishing an archiving, so i'll do that quickly for any zoom recordings that you sorry for any zoom meetings that you record.

299
00:48:17,174 --> 00:48:30,174
You can return here after the class. Actually, let me just resize this and come to the cloud recording tab under the Zoom meeting.

300
00:48:30,174 --> 00:48:35,174
This is one way that you can make these recordings of available to your students.

301
00:48:35,174 --> 00:48:48,174
So here are some class meeting examples, and all I have to do is move this Slider to make these available for students.

302
00:48:48,174 --> 00:49:08,174
So some communication may be needed, so that students know that every time they join a Zoom meeting, and one of you is zoom recording they can do so under the Zoom Menu under upcoming meetings or cloud recordings and

303
00:49:08,174 --> 00:49:17,174
I just want to note that zoom recordings will only remain saved for 150 days.

304
00:49:17,174 --> 00:49:37,174
There is a a backup tool that can be used that will transfer recordings to dropbox, which is one way that you could archive recordings the course or the faculty member can archive recordings this comes into play a

305
00:49:37,174 --> 00:49:51,174
lot, because a lot of times. instructors are looking for those old recordings, and if they haven't been downloaded or saved somewhere, they're gone. and this is strictly a deadline that's been set at

306
00:49:51,174 --> 00:49:55,174
the university level, and so Zoom completely wipes those out.

307
00:49:55,174 --> 00:50:05,174
At the request of the university. So there are some different ways that you can transfer those to dropbox using the automated option.

308
00:50:05,174 --> 00:50:11,174
These files can be downloaded and move to Panopo.

309
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:23,174
That will store them long term for viewing and maintain where they're only accessible through this canvas site.

310
00:50:23,174 --> 00:50:30,174
I tend to not share recordings through dropbox, because dropbox does not support closed captions.

311
00:50:30,174 --> 00:50:47,174
And so if i'm sharing with students I always try to put it in a location where I could download the Zoom transcript and upload it to the video and Panopo

312
00:50:47,174 --> 00:50:58,174
Alright, so that's our quick start on zoom with some tips, ideas, strategies, tools, I hope it's been helpful.

313
00:50:58,174 --> 00:51:10,174
If there's anything I can answer in the chat let me know support for zoom, you can always contact for the course as PHD instruction.

314
00:51:10,174 --> 00:51:26,174
If we can help with any of the plans. if you want help thinking about how what tools to use or how to set them up, we would be happy to help with that.

315
00:51:26,174 --> 00:51:37,174
If you have specific questions about zoom or something That's not working right in zoom for help, at you Mishu is the university.

316
00:51:37,174 --> 00:51:43,174
It department, and they support zoom and so sometimes when something's not working properly, you know.

317
00:51:43,174 --> 00:51:46,174
I can look at it with you, and sometimes we can figure it out.

318
00:51:46,174 --> 00:51:55,174
But sometimes that has to go to the university level and have them Look at, because my I don't have any administrative privileges.

319
00:51:55,174 --> 00:52:00,174
For zoom, but they would and so if there's some settings, or something like that.

320
00:52:00,174 --> 00:52:07,174
They need to look at. They would have the ability to do that

321
00:52:07,174 --> 00:52:22,174
I want to thank you so much for coming. I really appreciate it.
