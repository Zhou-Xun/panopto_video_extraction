1
00:00:02,631 --> 00:00:06,351
In this third part of the lecture, we'll
learn about the social determinants of

2
00:00:06,351 --> 00:00:08,989
mental illness and known risks and
protective factors.

3
00:00:08,989 --> 00:00:13,818
The social determinants of health are the
conditions in which people are born, grow,

4
00:00:13,818 --> 00:00:15,520
live, work and age.

5
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:19,318
These circumstances are shaped by
the distribution of money, power and

6
00:00:19,318 --> 00:00:24,857
resources at global,
national and local levels.

7
00:00:24,857 --> 00:00:29,221
The causes of mental illness are viewed
as a product of the interaction between

8
00:00:29,221 --> 00:00:33,160
biological, psychological,
and sociocultural factors.

9
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:38,491
Let's take a closer look
at some of these factors.

10
00:00:38,491 --> 00:00:42,367
Risk and protective factors exist
at the individual, family, and

11
00:00:42,367 --> 00:00:44,840
school or community levels.

12
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:49,070
During childhood, risk factors for
depression include negative self-image,

13
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:53,450
family dysfunction, and child abuse,
and poor academic performance.

14
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:57,640
For anxiety, risk factors include shyness,
marital conflict and

15
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,850
witnessing community violence.

16
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:04,087
Protective factors during childhood
include secure attachments,

17
00:01:04,087 --> 00:01:08,908
good peer relationships, healthy peer
groups, socioeconomic security and

18
00:01:08,908 --> 00:01:15,569
resources, extended family support and
school engagement.

19
00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:18,800
In young adulthood risk factors for
depression and

20
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:23,383
anxiety include early puberty,
poor social skills, peer rejection,

21
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:27,040
parental unemployment,
violence and trauma.

22
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,797
Protective factors include academic
achievement, emotional self-regulation and

23
00:01:31,797 --> 00:01:37,409
supportive family relationships.

24
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:41,656
It's also very important to think about
socioeconomic status as a specific risk

25
00:01:41,656 --> 00:01:43,770
factor for mental illness.

26
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,640
Research has shown time and time again,
that poverty is a risk factor for

27
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,610
mental health problems.

28
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:53,050
As you can see on the right of your
screen, the prevalence of depression for

29
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:57,110
individuals below the poverty line is
more than twice the prevalence found

30
00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:00,010
in individuals at or
above the poverty line.

31
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:02,644
These data come from the CDC.

32
00:02:02,644 --> 00:02:07,140
The importance of this is summed up nicely
in the 2009 World Health Organization

33
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,756
report Mental Health,
Resilience and Inequalities.

34
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:15,860
It reads, it is absolutely clear that the
chronic stress of struggling with material

35
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:21,180
disadvantage is intensified to a very
considerable degree by doing so

36
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,570
in more unequal societies.

37
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:27,135
For this reason, levels of mental
distress among communities

38
00:02:27,135 --> 00:02:30,699
need to be understood less in
terms of individual pathology and

39
00:02:30,699 --> 00:02:34,613
more as the response to relative
deprivation and social injustice.

40
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:37,301
Which erode the emotional, spiritual, and

41
00:02:37,301 --> 00:02:41,440
intellectual resources essential
to psychological well-being.

42
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,360
Let's look at this in the US context,

43
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,130
specifically focusing on race and
ethnicity.

44
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:51,770
There are great inequalities with
regard to mental illness by racial and

45
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:53,425
ethnic identities.

46
00:02:53,425 --> 00:02:57,290
But these disparities are not
necessarily in terms of prevalence.

47
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:02,280
As you can see here, the prevalence of
mental health symptoms, no symptoms,

48
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,880
mild, moderate and severe symptoms, is
actually quite comparable across the three

49
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:11,220
different racial and ethnic groups,
Hispanic, black, and white.

50
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:16,760
Rather the greatest racial disparities
are in terms of who gets treatment.

51
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:20,670
This slide shows rates of treatment among
individuals with a major depressive

52
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:26,030
episode in the past year by race and
ethnicity from 2009 to 2015.

53
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:29,915
The first trend to notice
is that between 30 and

54
00:03:29,915 --> 00:03:32,790
50% of individuals are not
receiving any treatment.

55
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:36,520
We will be talking about this
in the next part of the lecture.

56
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:41,130
But focusing here on disparities, we can
see that around 70% of white adults with

57
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:43,780
a major depressive episode
received treatment.

58
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:46,417
That's the white line at
the top of the chart.

59
00:03:46,417 --> 00:03:51,059
The red line shows that between about
50% to 60% of black adults received

60
00:03:51,059 --> 00:03:53,050
treatment during these years.

61
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:57,110
And a similar trend for
Hispanic adults in yellow.

62
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:01,600
The take away here, and this is consistent
across other types of mental illnesses

63
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,020
is that white people are getting
treatment at higher rates than racial and

64
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,840
ethnic minority groups.

65
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,250
This is an undeniable heath disparity and
one that warrants continued and

66
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:15,700
increased attention from
a public health perspective.

67
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:20,259
Another important reality to recognize is
that serious mental illnesses are highly

68
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:22,940
prevalent in the justice system.

69
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:27,192
There are ten times more people with
mental illness behind bars than

70
00:04:27,192 --> 00:04:29,961
in state-funded psychiatric treatment.

71
00:04:29,961 --> 00:04:34,484
Two million people with mental illness
go to state and local jails every year.

72
00:04:34,484 --> 00:04:38,911
And according to the Department
of Justice about half of

73
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:44,105
the prison population has symptoms
of a serious mental illness.

74
00:04:44,105 --> 00:04:47,187
Lastly for this part of the lecture,
I just want to touch on and

75
00:04:47,187 --> 00:04:50,215
correct some misperceptions
surrounding mental illness,

76
00:04:50,215 --> 00:04:54,070
mainly that people with
mental illnesses are violent.

77
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:57,130
As advocacy is an important
part of public health,

78
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,632
I think that this is important
to clarify with a few facts.

79
00:05:00,632 --> 00:05:05,315
First, less than 5% of the 120,000
gun-related killings in

80
00:05:05,315 --> 00:05:10,370
the US were perpetrated by
individuals with mental illnesses.

81
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:14,430
Relatedly, adults with mental illnesses
are far more likely to be victims

82
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:17,690
of community violence
rather than perpetrators.

83
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:21,980
We really need to recognize this fact and
shift our perceptions.

84
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:25,030
Finally and
quite shockingly half of people shot and

85
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:29,410
killed by police each year in
the United States has a mental illness.

86
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:31,260
Law officers play an important role,

87
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:34,200
including through their work
with the homeless populations

88
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:38,500
which are also disproportionately
burdened by mental illness.

89
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:42,110
Sadly, less than 15% of law
enforcement jurisdictions

90
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:45,180
offer crisis intervention training for
police officers

91
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:49,410
to be able to work more effectively
with individuals with mental illness.

92
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:52,461
Like so much of the material covered
in this part of the lecture,

93
00:05:52,461 --> 00:05:58,967
there is enormous room for
improvement through policy change.
