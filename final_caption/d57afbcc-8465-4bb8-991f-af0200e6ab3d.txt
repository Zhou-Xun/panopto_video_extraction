1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,660
I was doing that. But I will see what I can bring around.

2
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,649
Okay. I like it.

3
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:17,100
Literally. It's just blank. It's just like I know I accidentally before.

4
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:25,650
So maybe that would be it, but I don't know.

5
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:29,820
It's just like. I'll check. Okay.

6
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:38,490
I don't know how much that's going to help, but. So I'm looking for my cross to 18.

7
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,880
It has a reflector. It didn't reflect it.

8
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,950
It should have been no issue. Now through at 17.

9
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:50,219
Can you. Can you? Yeah, it must have. I must not have saved it.

10
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:56,590
Can you email me so that I just have it and I can respond to it in my like, oh, no.

11
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:07,330
But you should have saved it. Yeah. That's where you.

12
00:01:23,130 --> 00:02:27,280
I just. I.

13
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:52,900
I. Yeah.

14
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:10,290
Yeah. Good morning.

15
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:18,000
I hope everybody I hope everybody have a great holiday if you celebrate.

16
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:24,030
We're on our way to the very end of this course.

17
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:30,810
So you get the privilege of hearing from your classmates today.

18
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:41,350
So today, just to give you a sense of the flow, we got three presentations.

19
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:46,900
You get 15 to talk and you get five, four questions.

20
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,330
And I will be sitting over here.

21
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:57,220
I thankfully got sick. Brian and time just to come back to work.

22
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,650
So I will be wearing this mask.

23
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:09,650
If you're presenting, I might lift up this iPad and give you a five minute warning and a one minute warning for your presentation.

24
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:21,080
And I will be taking notes. And let's see, I encourage you all to ask questions during that 5 minutes if you're not presenting.

25
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,150
And today we have. It.

26
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:36,000
Let me open it up so I can see the order. Oh.

27
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,970
Ah. We have group six, group two and group one.

28
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:47,620
Who? So does anybody have any questions before we kind of jump into the presentations?

29
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:51,130
I'm not going to, you know, give a bunch of rigamarole other than that.

30
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:57,520
Are we using a microphone? You can if you want.

31
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:02,800
So I'm going to leave. So good question. I'm going to leave all these mikes.

32
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:08,730
Up here, you will probably pick up be picked up by this, though.

33
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:15,100
So don't turn that off. But if you want to use other mikes, you can turn this one on.

34
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:19,420
Oh, which I'm using right now. You can turn this one on.

35
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:25,270
I also am going to leave my handy dandy clicker up here if you want that too.

36
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,230
And it has a nice little laser if you like things like that.

37
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:41,160
Any other questions? So I'll be taking notes and then I will have the notes over to you with the grade.

38
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:47,280
A day or so after you present, just to give me a chance to, you know, actually email it to you.

39
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:54,400
Anything else? Thank you for sharing it with me.

40
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:57,700
See? Now it's all up. All ready to go. All right, I'm down.

41
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:09,010
Group six, Ben. Oh.

42
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:17,420
Okay. Don't start yet.

43
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:22,310
I'm just going to make it quick. Yeah. Do.

44
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:28,040
And I can move my laptop out of the way unless of course, there's on water.

45
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,450
Or I can just. Yeah. I was going to say. There's one up here to.

46
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:38,730
Gather here. Just let me know when you're ready.

47
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:48,450
And does this make you want to just do it just to be one time?

48
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:54,120
I'm okay. Right.

49
00:06:54,630 --> 00:07:02,459
All right. Let's go. Okay. So today we are going to be talking about University of Michigan sexual assault prevention and awareness centers,

50
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:05,520
bystander intervention and Community Engagement Program.

51
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:11,160
I'm Delaney, and I'm joined by my teammates Avery, Kathryn, Katie, Emily and Maddie.

52
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:15,720
So we're going to start off by giving you a little description of the problem at hand.

53
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:22,390
So as many of you are probably aware, sexual assault is a big issue, especially on college campuses.

54
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:29,620
In 2019, the Association of American Universities actually released a report that detailed findings from a campus

55
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:35,349
climate survey that focused on examining examining the prevalence of sexual assault and misconduct.

56
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:39,940
And what they found across the 27 universities that were included in the survey

57
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,920
is that the average reported rate of non-consensual sexual contact was 13%.

58
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:47,469
However, at the University of Michigan,

59
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:56,230
we found that students were reporting significantly higher rates of non-consensual sexual conduct than the survey use survey.

60
00:07:56,260 --> 00:08:00,970
So this indicates that there is an increased need for attention on this topic on our campus.

61
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:06,760
Bystander intervention is one way to decrease the instances of possible sexual assault.

62
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,939
But in a report published in 2020,

63
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:15,880
results showed that instances where students actually witnessed situations in which they thought could lead to sexual assault.

64
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:20,200
Only 45% of them actually directly intervened.

65
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:29,430
So one organization at the University of Michigan that seeks to address sexual assault, intimate partner violence,

66
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:36,510
stalking and sexual and gender based harassment is the Sexual Assault Prevention and Awareness Center, also known as State Park.

67
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:42,480
And State Park offers targeted trainings, including bystander intervention and community engagement trainings,

68
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:47,940
which are a form of secondary prevention efforts that aim to instill active bystander skills

69
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:52,410
into all individuals on campus so that they can intervene before a situation occurs.

70
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:55,980
And these types of trainings usually utilize the theory of planned behavior,

71
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:01,440
which argues that if you can affect an individual's attitudes and beliefs towards an issue and their perspective

72
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,870
around the social acceptability of taking action while giving them the knowledge and confidence to intervene,

73
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:12,639
then they will do so. And this evaluation will provide leadership,

74
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,590
staff and volunteers at the University of Michigan's Office of Student Life and See PAC

75
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:23,139
with a report on the implementation and outcomes of their bystander intervention and

76
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:28,000
community engagement trainings in order to gauge progress towards the goal of increasing

77
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,670
levels of bystander awareness and impact and intervention on the Ann Arbor campus.

78
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,610
So here we have a condensed version of our logic model.

79
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:43,549
Our evaluation is centered around our short term outcomes, which are focused on increasing students,

80
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:47,690
bystander intervention skills and their knowledge of campus resources.

81
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:53,210
We anticipate that achieving these outcomes will help us work towards our ultimate,

82
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,489
overarching impact reducing the incidence of sexual assault on the University

83
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:02,060
of Michigan campus and increasing the use of bystander intervention skills.

84
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:12,170
And now we'll get into our process and our valuations. So our process evaluation focuses on really evaluating whether employees,

85
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:16,730
facilitators and staff are effective with administering and teaching place programing,

86
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:23,750
along with also looking at how well measuring how well our target population of first year students are being represented.

87
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:31,900
So our first question gets into what I mentioned, which is how well the staff and volunteers are have been trained in our implementing

88
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:35,740
our programs and we have several indicators to look at how that is being measured.

89
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:42,400
So we're going to look at the satisfaction levels among participants in accordance with the flow and quality of the program facilitation.

90
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:48,460
And then we're going to look at, you know, the time and type of training facilitators along with participant understanding of the material.

91
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,200
Our second cost is the question is to what extent did our intervention population really

92
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,860
represent the demographics of our intended population at the University of Michigan?

93
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:02,510
And our indicators for that question are going to be the numbers of various demographic groups.

94
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:07,280
We're aware of based programing on campus, along with first year students who are aware of base programing.

95
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,899
So as far as the album evaluation goes,

96
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:18,400
we are hoping to evaluate the effectiveness of the program to achieve those outcomes that were discussed in the logic model.

97
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:25,209
We decided to do an experimental research design with a pretest process control group, and in order to achieve this,

98
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:31,870
we randomized participants into either the advice intervention group or into a control group.

99
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:39,760
That was the bystander intervention. So here we included the design notion notation, just so that you guys could have a good representation of it.

100
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:44,140
So we have the two different groups, the intervention and the control groups that were randomized.

101
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:51,240
We took the pretest observation, performed the intervention, and we measured again.

102
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:56,750
To see what that change in knowledge, attitudes and behavior.

103
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:03,010
So our first question that we asked was to what extent this person's knowledge

104
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:07,660
of available resources on sexual assault increased following intervention.

105
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:14,190
So we looked at three or four indicators for this. First was, what were the number of students who reported attending a bystander?

106
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:20,100
The second indicator was the number of participants who were able to use one or more resource available on.

107
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:25,210
And then the third was how many of those contestants then shared that information?

108
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,930
For the second evaluation question,

109
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:35,890
we looked at what extent did participants report a change in utilization of abortion or intervention techniques following the.

110
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:40,370
And we looked at two indicators here. The first was the number of students who have.

111
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:48,780
Using all those intervention techniques that they were. And the second was the number seems to be according to two or more of those.

112
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:56,100
Next, we'll talk about our data collection plan, beginning with our sampling strategy.

113
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:01,770
So as mentioned, our population of interest is the University of Michigan first year undergraduates.

114
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:10,829
We're targeting this population because of the red zone, which is the time in the fall semester when more than 50% of campus sexual assaults occur,

115
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:14,670
particularly among first year students who have not been on campus before.

116
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:22,110
From this population of interest, we derive our sample frame, which is participants who opt into our program.

117
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:29,069
We're offering a $15 incentive to increase the range of participants who are in the program and

118
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:33,260
hopefully reduce selection bias so that we're not just getting people who are interested in bias in.

119
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,379
Training already. From here,

120
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:46,290
we'll use a probability approach with systematic sampling to randomize our participants into either the treatment group or the control group.

121
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:51,420
Every third person will be put into the treatment group and then the rest into the control group.

122
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:58,320
Both groups will complete the pre survey, post survey and post interview,

123
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:04,229
and then the treatment group will go through an hour long interactive workshop which is based on active intervention

124
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:10,620
skills and the control group will do an hour long lecture on bystander intervention in sexual assault.

125
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:17,670
In terms of our data collection plan, we'll collect data both from participants as well as by staff.

126
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:27,960
Beginning with participants, we will use between group design and we will look at the pre survey and post array which all participants will take.

127
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:31,350
This will be self-administered via the online survey platform.

128
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:41,130
Qualtrics. We will provide resources for accessibility needs, including mind reading through the survey or a written survey as needed.

129
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:47,790
And then we will ask 25% of participants to participate in a semi-structured post interview.

130
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:52,830
This will be a randomly selected subsample that we will recruit via email.

131
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:58,159
We will continue to recruit until we've reached 25% of participants and will

132
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,420
draw from both the treatment group and the control group for that interview.

133
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:07,550
Participants will receive an additional $10 incentive for completing the ten minute interview.

134
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,380
And then in terms of our staff,

135
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:18,599
we will use structured observation during the training sessions that staff receive prior to conducting the workshops to make

136
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:24,600
sure that anticipated topics are being covered and adequate resources are being provided for them to complete the trainings.

137
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:27,540
And then after the conclusion of the intervention,

138
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:34,110
we will ask staff to participate in a 90 minute focus group to gather their thoughts on whether or not they received adequate training.

139
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:38,040
And next, we will cover our data analysis and interpretation.

140
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:45,560
As we just mentioned, our data collection. Qualitative and quantitative data.

141
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,810
So they. And so in order to.

142
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:59,370
It's going to include all parties involved in the creation and the dissipation of the program.

143
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:06,230
We would do an interpretation. Focus groups. And with all these corporations.

144
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:17,860
Students can provide their first. Volunteers can include their observations and overall perspective on the success of the program.

145
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:26,190
The can. Speak to the data analysis for the previous.

146
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:36,850
So we want to include also the people that might be giving us interventions in the future.

147
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:43,770
So. Next year after changes may be made to the program to adjust to the use of these kinds.

148
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:59,639
This data is consistent and follows the. And so in order to observe the change in the people's data, we've outlined standards to success,

149
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:03,910
which are based on our short and long term goals of our program.

150
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:10,930
And so on the next slide, we have two examples of the person process and health indicators.

151
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:17,730
That we discussed earlier. So the first one was the number of participants in the population and just.

152
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:22,570
The standard of success for that would be coming back into the students.

153
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:33,490
All my advice to them. And then an example of an outcome indicator tends to be the number of students who can name two or more of the best.

154
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,640
Spectrum Plus program. The standard for that is having.

155
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:47,010
80% of students who attended the base workshop reporting a series of things utilized 1 to 4 of the intervention techniques that they had.

156
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:56,190
And these specific indicators are derived from our logic model and are going to be used to set excess.

157
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:08,270
Go. So we're going to finish off with our dissemination of findings, starting with our invested parties.

158
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:12,530
We have multiple investor parties. As we mentioned, our priority group is first year students.

159
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:18,260
Future and incoming students are also important because they will eventually become our priority group of first year students.

160
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:22,310
We also have the CPAC team and any other workshop volunteers.

161
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:30,530
We have the full University of Michigan school leadership, and we also took an interest in Greek life since we know a lot of these students are out,

162
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:35,450
more social events and might have more use for interventions like the bystander intervention.

163
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:40,670
So we have we want to use multiple channels of dissemination.

164
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:47,870
The main one being a report. So the report will include both of the process and outcome questions that we have.

165
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:54,620
And we will also have two versions of this report. We're going to have a summary version that includes all the highlights of our findings.

166
00:18:54,620 --> 00:19:01,699
And then we're also going to have the option for people to click a link to lead to a full length report that will actually have all of our findings,

167
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:06,709
our methodology, demographics, etc. We know that the reports have strengths.

168
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:15,560
They can be accessed quickly and published quickly, but we also know that they have weaknesses, so they're not peer reviewed.

169
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:21,050
And we know that students and faculty at the University of Michigan get tons and tons of emails each day.

170
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:23,750
So it's really easy for them to miss something like this.

171
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:30,710
So that's why we want to use different channels of dissemination for some of the other groups to focus on issues that will affect them the most.

172
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:34,520
So our second channel dissemination will be in-person events.

173
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:40,010
Due to the seriousness of this topic, we think having a live audience will help get our findings effectively communicated.

174
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:43,940
And we want to first work with, say, pack first and foremost, sorry,

175
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:50,330
because they will be representing both of our process evaluation questions so that so this is really important.

176
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:57,139
And additionally, they will be taking over the monitoring of all of the rest of our findings and implementing them.

177
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:00,320
So we want to make sure that, you know, we have an active discussion.

178
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:04,370
My hesitations include visualization, graphics and pitch recommendations.

179
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:11,160
Additionally, we want to talk to you about the leadership team, which will have teams and executive officers present.

180
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:19,320
And we want to focus on the important findings and outcomes. And lastly, often universities have compliance programs that are mandatory.

181
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:24,600
So in partnership with the university, we want to add these evaluation findings into one of these workshops.

182
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:28,470
And lastly, the workshop modules and social media channel.

183
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:38,550
So we want to work with our first year students on implementing mandatory workshops for students that arrive to campus to hear our incoming students.

184
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:44,310
And then part of the free orientation program. And lastly, most college age students do engage with social media.

185
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:48,090
So therefore, we thought, in addition to in-person workshops will hold for Greek life.

186
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:54,960
And we've launched a social media campaign to present our findings would be really beneficial.

187
00:20:56,910 --> 00:21:01,800
So to conclude with this information, we are hoping that state park, along with other key collaborators,

188
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:07,890
we'll be able to monitor and create a safer environment for first year students and equip and inform them.

189
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:13,090
Inform them with bystander intervention techniques. And this concludes our presentation.

190
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:30,680
I have a question. Oh, it's.

191
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:40,390
So you. Back in the design.

192
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:46,530
Go back to the outcome design slide for.

193
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:56,520
Well, anyway. So you're choosing you're choosing to interview a random selection of people in the survey.

194
00:21:57,930 --> 00:22:02,970
So I'm like. What?

195
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:07,140
What things are you hoping to kind of build on the survey?

196
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:17,959
By doing. We're thinking that this will help us to gather more detailed information from students than what would be in the survey.

197
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:25,700
For the survey, we'll ask specific questions about their knowledge and attitudes and comfort ability, executing the skills,

198
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:32,839
and then the interviews will ask them to talk through situations where they have

199
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:37,370
experienced a need for intervention and either chosen to intervene or not chosen to

200
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:44,540
intervene and to talk about like if that happened pre workshop what they were thinking

201
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:49,550
about doing and what they would do post workshop to see if there's a change in their.

202
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:51,460
Their skills there.

203
00:22:52,300 --> 00:23:02,890
So the the questions in the surveys are a little bit more focused on the exact translation of knowledge and whether you acquired those skills.

204
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:20,950
And then the interviews. INTERVIEWER focused more on application. So you think that.

205
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:35,819
Yeah, I think we would definitely stagger, especially, you know, looking at incoming and future students.

206
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:38,550
That would be something that we would hope to do here.

207
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:43,950
Students that are interested in the University of Michigan or have received their acceptance would receive some of this information.

208
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:50,190
The report is most likely what we would hope to get out first and then schedule in-person workshops.

209
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:53,339
Some of them, you know, we expect people to reach out to us and others.

210
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:56,340
We expect to reach out to groups to work with them.

211
00:23:57,030 --> 00:24:07,000
So that's a good question. I think we definitely would stagger. So you have a lot of different that.

212
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:21,530
Morgan. How would you rather? So we'd like to, but we definitely want to tailor it.

213
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:24,140
And that's why we did choose different ways.

214
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:31,009
So, for example, for the social media campaign, I think coming in, you know, we're kind of be relatable to students.

215
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:37,520
We probably have, you know, stories or people explaining their own stories if they were comfortable and, you know, quick facts and stuff.

216
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:44,060
And then with, you know, the in-person meetings, we want to have clear visual graphics and we're presenting to, say, PAC employees.

217
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:48,260
So with that, we're presenting to, you know, C PAC internal employees.

218
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:53,479
We would, you know, tailor it to their program. What can they do within their own program versus, you know,

219
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:59,930
presenting to the school board and executive officers where we'd be more kind of like, can you invest in our program?

220
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:04,140
So really taking an approach on who we're talking to, we definitely want to take the idea.

221
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:13,780
Thank you. Oh, yes.

222
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:22,770
And I forgot to give a disclaimer. Don't be afraid of looking at your monitor and find things up your glasses and notes.

223
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:31,980
And so a greater cover like you are looking at me, I'm like, okay, I am able to watch the clock right now.

224
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:55,660
And that's all right through to. I will.

225
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:09,390
Start the time. It's not much.

226
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,750
That's correct. But never did.

227
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:26,999
All right. Good morning, everybody. My name is Darryl, Recruit two, and these are my partners from education.

228
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,230
So I'm going. My name's Jackie.

229
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:36,990
Never called to go to the next slide for you.

230
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:41,770
Which way do you go? The air.

231
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:45,669
You turned it up right up goes for. Okay.

232
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:51,370
There you go. So to start off, we just want to give you a timeline of the topics we'll be covering today,

233
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:55,900
and then there'll be a timeline at the bottom here that you can follow along.

234
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:57,130
Go to next slide.

235
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:12,190
So the purpose of this evaluation that we're doing is that we want to provide our invested parties and our an accounting of the current

236
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:20,200
H-2A program in San Mateo County and look for areas of improvement so that we can further adapt to other HLA programs across the country.

237
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:24,530
Slide like these are invested parties.

238
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:28,930
We don't use the word stakeholders. Please forgive the stakeholders title at the top there.

239
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:33,520
We just want to point out that they're all affiliated with the University of California.

240
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:42,489
Still go blue. And because we're engaged with elementary students, you're one important stakeholder.

241
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:47,379
Here is the legal guardians. We want to ensure that we're not overstepping our boundaries here when engaging

242
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:51,970
with the students and as well as the people who pay us the program funders,

243
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:57,160
we want to make sure that we are reaching their needs for areas that they're most interested in.

244
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:04,420
Moving on to the description of the program. So as you can see, it's eight.

245
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:10,240
We program once a week. It's taught by ten ambassadors that have been employed by the program.

246
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:16,270
They're relatively close in age in the sense of that they're at least 16 or older.

247
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:21,700
And again, as mentioned earlier, is with elementary students participating in the program.

248
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:30,820
And what we're essentially trying to do is curb the high rates of obesity that are present among poor and ethnic minority communities.

249
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:37,450
And we're doing this through teaching about nutrition, gardening and skills and healthy eating.

250
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:41,400
Okay.

251
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:50,090
So now we're going to move on to focusing on the evaluation design, which includes the logic model that we worked with our investment partners on.

252
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:59,650
So the yellow highlighted boxes on our logic model are the specific ways that we personally will be covering evaluation through our program.

253
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:06,820
So and then the white ones are the ones that are more broader that will be used with data from other sources within our program.

254
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:15,790
Yes. So. So using the logic model and working with our partners, that is how we created the questions.

255
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:20,240
So first you start with the process. Evaluation questions is question one.

256
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:24,940
To what extent did HLA program activities happen in the plant border?

257
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:31,959
And this is important because we all know COVID happened and a lot of other respiratory illnesses happened,

258
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,880
especially among elementary school students.

259
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:40,840
And also in California, there is a lot of wildfires and that can cause a lot of smoke and create hazardous quality.

260
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:46,690
Like in 2018, it was so bad that they shut all businesses and outdoor activities down.

261
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:54,790
Question to you is to what extent were the intended HLA program activities and education resources used?

262
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:59,830
Going to outcome evaluation questions one.

263
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:04,650
To what extent in elementary school students increased fruits and vegetable consumption?

264
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:11,670
Two. To what extent did elementary school students increase knowledge about gardening and garden based nutrition?

265
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:19,590
And three. To what extent did the teenage allies increase motivation and self-efficacy to practice healthy eating behaviors?

266
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:26,890
So this is our. Playbook.

267
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:35,080
So this is our design here we decided to do is not radicalization just because we

268
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:42,820
felt that it wouldn't be moral or ethical to decide who gets like healthy eating.

269
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:46,640
Intervention in food doesn't just. That's positive for everybody.

270
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:53,450
So we just decided to take a school that didn't have the intervention,

271
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:59,839
was not a part of the program that has similar demographic of students to compare the outcomes to.

272
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:05,479
Obviously, when we in the same county did the intervention and then we did a six month plus

273
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:13,520
intervention follow up just to see whether or not the results were long term without any.

274
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:26,420
And then obviously for step four, as we know, we want to gather credible evidence which requires us,

275
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:34,880
as opposed to a couple of different things, including just identifying indicators and activities for the outcomes.

276
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:43,730
And this obviously was to contribute to our credibility when we gave our overall evaluation of the program and the recommendations for how.

277
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:49,150
Who is to define a narrower sampling scope.

278
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:56,379
We created a frame that was for HLA programs of certainty accounting and then we want

279
00:31:56,380 --> 00:32:01,660
that comparison to see what the intervention did compared to a non intervention group.

280
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:07,180
So we chose two elementary schools within San Diego County to do that comparison and

281
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:12,170
then some exclusion criteria was we didn't want any incomplete pretest proposed tests,

282
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:17,829
we wanted all the questions to be included and we didn't want students who missed a section as participation was

283
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:26,410
one of our goals throughout the program and we chose a simple random sampling approach to do that comparison.

284
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:33,440
So building off of the process, questions that Jackie mentioned.

285
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:43,610
Indicators are a way to measure those functions. So first one, to what extent the only program activities chocolate is the planned order.

286
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:46,899
And you're going to measure this by assessing the order,

287
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:53,510
date and time of the two day training sessions and also the reflection and evaluation session.

288
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:59,150
And additionally measuring the number of elementary students attending each session.

289
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:03,620
And to do that, we're going to use administrative data.

290
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:13,639
And then for our second question, by agreeing to what extent these activities happened or where they were, the resources were used.

291
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:20,780
We're going to. Measure the number of fruit and vegetables provided you get consumed and also the number of education booklets provided.

292
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:30,969
So then for outcome methods, we also chose indicators to support the questions that we know.

293
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:37,270
Jack, you talked about and then you can see in our methods for well or for two of the questions,

294
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:43,570
we have qualitative methods to help us determine success and well evaluation.

295
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:50,890
And so those would be the semi-structured interviews that are for the ten NHL players only.

296
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:57,010
But then the survey is the survey for the change in teen motivation will be a

297
00:33:57,010 --> 00:34:02,140
scale for a numerical scale to help determine their motivation at the beginning,

298
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:11,590
during the end of the program. And then the other quantitative measure was for the California Youth Nutrition and Physical Activity Survey.

299
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:19,570
That was for the students to determine the change number of fruits and vegetables consumed based on the intervention that we used.

300
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:24,740
All right. So let's dive into the quantitative data collection.

301
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:28,090
So we have a lot of methods that we're using for data collection.

302
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:34,610
So we wanted to incorporate some of the secondary data. That way we could reduce some of the resources and expense that is required.

303
00:34:34,910 --> 00:34:41,120
So some of which includes the administrative data which records day time and attendance of all sessions.

304
00:34:41,390 --> 00:34:46,220
From that information, we can also gather the time of length between sessions that occurred.

305
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:54,170
And so what will happen is a team HLA during each session using an iPad will record the attendance the day and the time that it occurred,

306
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:59,689
and that is already using the HLA program database that is already existing.

307
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:09,980
So again using kind of existing processes to collect the data and then also basically at the end to incentivize to actually collect this material,

308
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:12,710
we're going to give them a bonus pay at the ends.

309
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:20,690
Additionally, there are two sessions, the training and then the evaluation, and instead of having a team report that data,

310
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:24,080
it will be to administrators from office brands that will record that data.

311
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:31,970
And then then we have purchase orders that will collect the number of education booklets and then the number of fruits and vegetables for snacks,

312
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:37,760
because the garden itself actually won't be ready to harvest till the very end of the program or after the program,

313
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:43,490
and isn't sufficient enough to also provide the amount of vegetables provided for all the elementary school students.

314
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:48,740
We also will have a survey for the elementary school students.

315
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:53,000
This is the California Youth Nutrition and Physical Activity Survey,

316
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:58,910
and this is provided by the Snap Ed Kids, which is one of our stakeholders using Cal Fresh.

317
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:08,540
We have questionnaires for the teen HLA using validated measures that already exist, the eating motivation scale and this eating self-efficacy scale,

318
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:14,149
which also ties into our larger goal of reducing obesity rates and then structured observations.

319
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:19,080
Where to use a checklist and count of fruit and vegetables. Yeah.

320
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:25,780
So for our qualitative data collection approach will be using semi-structured interviews like power dynamics and.

321
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:34,320
And this will also be accompanied by a recording which will produce an automated transfer, which will allow.

322
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:41,129
To uncover governmental. And furthermore,

323
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:49,650
respondents that will be accessible be useful to us and we will be access after school in the classroom and questions

324
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:56,340
to be asked to this group have the goal of assessing opinions regarding the consumption of fruits and vegetables.

325
00:36:56,950 --> 00:37:01,860
And awareness, particularly towards knowledge about gardening and garden based instruction.

326
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:06,790
And in addition, the question will be kept to a minimum. Six questions.

327
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:12,680
To avoid an overwhelming pullout from public. Large.

328
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:20,240
Recruitment efforts will consist of emailing students and the parents or legal guardians

329
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,700
will meet prior to the session to request confirmation of attendance and from.

330
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:33,080
In addition, for those unavailable to attend phone interviews will be conducted to reduce in on this one's bias.

331
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:40,319
Also follow up services will be administered on site starting online at six

332
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:45,180
months after the evaluation session to collect data on intermediate outcomes.

333
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:50,890
In which case the participants relocate will also be sent to reduce attrition.

334
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:58,319
Finally incentive factor, finally incentive granted after completion.

335
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,360
And this will consist of a generous amount of $20.

336
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:14,300
Yes. So everything not perfect. So internal validity will have some possible threads like selection, bias and instrumentation.

337
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:19,360
So for selection bias, it may be possible that preexisting differences.

338
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:26,380
Between both groups. In terms of existing habits and what resources are available.

339
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:32,820
Their results may be skewed. If the comparison groups are not comparing, we'll have to wait for.

340
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:42,379
And in case of instrumentation, well, it is important to highlight that some material has a diverse racial composition.

341
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:50,060
Therefore, multiple languages are spoken in the area. And in terms of collecting data well through questions I for surveys,

342
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:54,860
this may produce integrity results in the translation and may not account for the fluency.

343
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:01,540
So next we're going to cover justified conclusions.

344
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:11,990
And this is going to be. But with the evidence we gathered and judging them against the agreed upon values and standards set by the stakeholders.

345
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:17,429
So firstly, just going over the existing descriptive statistical data,

346
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:22,500
we're going to be measuring the mean number of participants across all of the sessions

347
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:28,200
for the entirety of the sessions and also the count of the sessions occurring.

348
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:32,370
So that will be the exception that are intended upon the logic model.

349
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:37,140
Fruits and vegetables order the average count of the fruits and vegetables and.

350
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,790
What's provided and received for our survey analysis will be conducted between group designs,

351
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:47,900
which will be comparing those in the intervention group to those.

352
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:51,940
Here's a look at it to take a sample t test, which would be.

353
00:39:53,320 --> 00:40:00,160
Outcome. And statistical significance. It's measuring the likelihood that the result is due to chance.

354
00:40:01,970 --> 00:40:05,140
The number of participants that participated in the.

355
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:12,900
The average. Vegetables. And that for our qualitative analysis, we're going to.

356
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,900
Transcriptions of those sometimes structured interviews that.

357
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:23,970
And also further over those after they are recorded to utilize is to be able to plot specific.

358
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:32,590
So the individuals that will be involved in this analysis are going to.

359
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:38,320
The school board and also the board of county commissioners have jurisdiction.

360
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:44,710
Curriculum in the county, but also should include the parents and legal guardians because they.

361
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:52,470
You should have a say in the curriculum before students are called in as well, and also includes the data of the teenage boys.

362
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:57,630
Elementary students, as we are, implies in a qualitative data program, stronger.

363
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:03,530
So we touched upon the indicators earlier in the analysis, but.

364
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:07,090
What will help determine the success of these.

365
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:16,210
So we're going to analyze what really 95% of the actual activities will happen in order attendance of at least 95%,

366
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:24,740
at least 85% or 80% of the professional. Verified as a checklist, observation and also a.

367
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:34,070
We provided. Along with those success standards, we wanted to consider the outcomes.

368
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:40,459
And in that we wanted to make sure that 90% increase in fruit and vegetable consumption

369
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:46,490
overall by one through one vegetable and that we use 85% of electricity is identified,

370
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:48,620
at least like in eating fruits and vegetables.

371
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:56,809
And then 90% of elementary students reported learning new information just to help with the long term effects of this program.

372
00:41:56,810 --> 00:42:07,280
And then 80% of teens, which is I didn't identify it, an increase in motivation and 98% of them identified increase in self-efficacy.

373
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:14,220
Yes. So step six, essentially, however, I find it to be shared with the next slide.

374
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:19,500
As mentioned earlier, our invested parties are the primary ones who will be receiving this information.

375
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:25,270
We've elected to distribute our findings in two ways a written report and a presentation.

376
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:33,210
We elected the written report because of its easy access to not only ourselves as a team, but as well as the investment parties.

377
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:37,260
And we also elected the presentation because we wanted an opportunity to have direct

378
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:43,830
feedback from the investor parties and discuss any findings or furthermore with in person.

379
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:47,639
And then at the conclusion of our presentation,

380
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:54,690
we will help the investor parties elect a program implementer of the recommendations we

381
00:42:54,690 --> 00:43:01,290
suggest for after conducting our evaluation and then after the individual is elected,

382
00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:06,180
we would then follow up with them two months from their start date to ensure that everything

383
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:11,040
is implemented properly or if they need any help or further assistance that we can help with.

384
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:24,920
And that is all. We will now take any questions. Yeah.

385
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:33,740
So elementary aged students tend not to have the best developed communication skills.

386
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:44,090
Throughout. So sometimes people will sort of parents concerned about their children's eating habits or.

387
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:49,880
Consider that. You did.

388
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:50,900
Why did you decide to get.

389
00:43:54,290 --> 00:44:01,810
I can speak to the survey element of it that when we actually used a they designed a survey specifically for a younger audience,

390
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:05,790
I think it was like from 46th graders or something like that.

391
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:06,430
They might be wrong.

392
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:13,790
But anyways, if it's the age range of like the elementary students that we are participating in the group, so we decided to go with that option.

393
00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:17,779
It has like pictures and stuff in it and like examples and the questions are like way

394
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:23,420
less complex to gather information about their consumption of fruits and vegetables.

395
00:44:24,590 --> 00:44:26,810
And then interviews. I don't know where he wants to go with that.

396
00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:35,590
Although we don't have the parents interviewed, we did include them in an investor party to review the.

397
00:44:39,550 --> 00:44:48,550
Student has said consuming. Or to festivals like based off the survey data and also their observations that open.

398
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:52,480
Further access to the program for the first time.

399
00:44:55,030 --> 00:44:58,120
Yeah. And just remaining cognitive of our population.

400
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:04,960
We understand that parents have a lot on their plate and we wouldn't we didn't want to overburdened them with more tasks and things like that.

401
00:45:05,830 --> 00:45:12,069
So that is why we just essentially wanted to allow them to look at the results and

402
00:45:12,070 --> 00:45:16,840
just have a say and interpret that as opposed to us their the entire process,

403
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:21,820
bugging them, asking them to do more things on their plate than that's already been axed.

404
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:39,070
So I appreciate that. With that about.

405
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:55,510
I should like the purchase order. Yeah. No, that is like the program, like facilitators who will be doing like the purchase orders of supply.

406
00:45:56,110 --> 00:46:00,579
And that's where that will come from. That's the other. But I feel really confident actually.

407
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:05,740
I can talk them how to pay for their own stuff enough or actually what they.

408
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:15,270
Yeah. You mentioned that we would like the.

409
00:46:16,270 --> 00:46:20,610
It's like a barrier to people thinking about how that would affect.

410
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:43,130
We spoke to that in the paper. So that's definitely something to consider adding, although I think that having.

411
00:46:44,930 --> 00:46:48,970
I like the scoreboard, which I like. Involved.

412
00:46:50,070 --> 00:46:57,060
As long as here. But that's a.

413
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:10,600
I mean, I came here now, so I don't have.

414
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:22,810
So like, how do you, I don't know, torture. Excellent question.

415
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:28,910
Oh, nice. Just.

416
00:47:43,690 --> 00:47:56,910
Right now it's a the game. I don't know if you know he's here, though.

417
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:05,060
We do just. Is that really what we do?

418
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:08,790
Yeah. I was like, I don't know how to get out.

419
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:16,700
You do drive down? Yeah. Know then you can't just close that.

420
00:48:17,190 --> 00:48:20,630
But that I can't see it. Yeah. Yeah.

421
00:48:20,770 --> 00:48:23,770
Can I use. Thank you. Okay.

422
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:30,630
This. They?

423
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:42,040
Okay. Yeah, cool.

424
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:49,850
Everything's. Just let me know already.

425
00:48:50,370 --> 00:48:54,439
Right. We're good. Okay. Okay. Hi, everyone.

426
00:48:54,440 --> 00:49:00,230
My name is Graciela, and I'm joined here by my group members Annie, Mikayla, Katie, Kalita, and Natalie.

427
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:05,630
And today, we're also going to present our evaluation plan of the Healthy Living Ambassadors program.

428
00:49:08,090 --> 00:49:13,510
Okay. I'm just kind of going through what we are going to talk about.

429
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:18,330
We'll talk about the program description or logic model or go through our design of the evaluation.

430
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:23,510
We'll talk about methods and data collection plan and analysis and also our dissemination.

431
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:28,670
So what is the Healthy Living Ambassador program?

432
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:36,439
It's a program which includes a collaboration between the University of California Cal Fresh program, the For Age Youth Development Program,

433
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:43,190
as well as the University of California Oaks Ranch, with local schools situated in San Mateo County in California.

434
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:49,340
The aim of the program overall is to help address the high rates of childhood obesity through their programing.

435
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:54,169
That focuses specifically on diet, quality and nutrition education.

436
00:49:54,170 --> 00:50:00,850
Starting at a young age, starting at elementary, as we know, among children from low income backgrounds,

437
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:05,810
we see higher levels of obesity compared to children from higher income backgrounds.

438
00:50:06,050 --> 00:50:09,710
And in San Mateo schools specifically that are participating in nature,

439
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:15,410
we see that approximately 50% of those students are qualifying for free and reduced lunch.

440
00:50:15,770 --> 00:50:21,410
And overall, approximately 34.1% of the children in San Mateo County are obese.

441
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:26,989
Thus, the program is well-situated to have a potential impact to help reduce the prevalence of

442
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:31,070
disease and improve healthy behaviors in the setting which we are planning to evaluate.

443
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:37,220
A little bit more about the program with regard to the elements.

444
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:44,810
The participants do include elementary school children and the teen teachers that are helping to deliver a garden

445
00:50:44,810 --> 00:50:51,230
based curriculum with hands on activities to learn about nutrition and gardening using an ecological approach.

446
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:59,270
It lasts around eight weeks, with sessions held that are once a week after school lasting from 60 to 75 minutes.

447
00:50:59,510 --> 00:51:04,820
And the program is delivered twice during the school year, first in the fall and then again in the spring.

448
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:11,030
And overall, the goals of the program are broken up by the age of the students who are involved in it.

449
00:51:11,030 --> 00:51:17,030
For the elementary school students, the aims of the program are to help increase fruit and vegetable consumption,

450
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:18,950
as well as knowledge of healthy eating.

451
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:27,650
And for the teens, it's to increase motivation for healthy behaviors and to help increase their self-efficacy and making healthy choices.

452
00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:40,120
So this is our logic model and it explains how the program is implemented and how its implementation can lead to different intended outcomes.

453
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:46,630
This program is reliant upon several inputs which activities of the program are built upon?

454
00:51:47,290 --> 00:51:54,430
The inputs include the partnership with the fresh program before each youth development and the use of this ranch.

455
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:58,610
The inputs for this program allow for program activities to take place.

456
00:51:59,030 --> 00:52:04,100
These activities start with a training session for teens who will participate in the program as the ambassadors.

457
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:08,690
After the training, the rest of the activities are broken down into weekly lessons,

458
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:14,240
which are supported by the teen ambassadors who act as mentors to the elementary school students.

459
00:52:15,150 --> 00:52:22,260
At completion of the program. Draft outcomes of the percentages of students who participated in the program can be measured.

460
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:29,290
Beyond measuring participation, the program can also be evaluated by several short and long term outcomes.

461
00:52:29,890 --> 00:52:33,610
Short term outcomes would be measured at completion of the program.

462
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:41,440
These outcomes include enhanced knowledge about healthy eating, gardening and nutrition among the elementary school participants,

463
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:47,710
and the improved sense of self-efficacy for making healthy choices among the team ambassadors.

464
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:54,720
Long term outcomes would be measured at a year after completion of the program to see overall changes in behaviors.

465
00:52:55,200 --> 00:53:01,860
These outcomes would include improving the percentage of participants that have increased their diet to more nutritious foods,

466
00:53:02,370 --> 00:53:09,390
increased percentage of the participants engaging in other healthy behaviors, and overall increased intake of fruits and vegetables.

467
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:19,790
Among the participants. So for our evaluation questions, we have three main questions, as you can see here.

468
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:25,730
For our process evaluation, we are looking specifically at mentor attendance and planning to use a multimodal design,

469
00:53:26,690 --> 00:53:31,999
including looking specifically at attendance logs to see trends in when attendance

470
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:37,879
is fading off and what is supporting that and then using that that data to support

471
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:41,660
interviews with the teen mentors themselves to talk about what supports and

472
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:46,280
inhibits their ability to attend sessions throughout the process of the program.

473
00:53:46,730 --> 00:53:53,410
When looking at our outcome evaluations, we're looking at a short term outcome, specifically about the teen self efficacy,

474
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:58,700
looking at participants rather than mentors, and looking at whether there's an improvement in that self efficacy.

475
00:53:58,940 --> 00:54:01,489
And then also for a long term outcome.

476
00:54:01,490 --> 00:54:12,170
Looking at actual dietary changes from those long term outcomes we discussed in our logic model, this is the set up for our outcome evaluations.

477
00:54:12,170 --> 00:54:19,159
It's going to be a quasi experimental nonrandom and non equivalent comparison group.

478
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:24,649
Looking at the group who had the intervention and comparing them with age

479
00:54:24,650 --> 00:54:29,450
matched students from the same feeder schools and giving them the same pretest.

480
00:54:29,450 --> 00:54:35,360
And our pre survey and post survey to look at changes in that knowledge, behaviors and attitudes.

481
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:43,160
Okay. So we're moving into the methods section.

482
00:54:43,170 --> 00:54:44,700
I'm going to be talking about sampling.

483
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:52,110
So our population of interest are the elementary school students that have participated in the eight program in San Mateo County,

484
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:58,260
the seven and eight year old elementary students, as well as the teen teachers that range from age 12 to 19.

485
00:54:58,650 --> 00:55:04,740
And then our sampling frame is limited to teen teachers and elementary school participants that still

486
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:10,530
reside in San Mateo County and are currently enrolled in the program for the current eight week session.

487
00:55:10,770 --> 00:55:17,370
And that's just to make sure that we have access to all the people that we want to include in the evaluation design.

488
00:55:18,510 --> 00:55:20,700
And then for our sampling strategy,

489
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:28,500
we decided to use a probability sampling design to ensure that the sample is generalizable and representative of our population of interest,

490
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:32,190
though it is a little bit more difficult than non probability sampling,

491
00:55:32,190 --> 00:55:39,030
we thought it would probably be worth it for the evaluation and then our sampling frame will include enrollment

492
00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:44,310
information for all the current program participate participants that allowed the approach to be possible.

493
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:50,310
And then we are going to use a cluster sampling approach within that sampling design,

494
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:54,660
given that our population is nested at different schools within San Mateo County.

495
00:55:54,930 --> 00:55:59,160
So each of the six San Mateo County school sites where the program is operating,

496
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:04,980
a simple random sample of the elementary school students and the teen teachers will be chosen from each site.

497
00:56:06,210 --> 00:56:11,670
So using the program enrollment information, each teacher and student will be assigned a random number.

498
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:19,200
And then a random number generator will be used to select participants to include in the evaluation again to help ensure that we have

499
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:27,300
representative data for each school site and then we'll interview for teens at each site for a total of 24 out of the 50 participating teens.

500
00:56:27,690 --> 00:56:35,580
And then for the elementary school students, we will administer surveys to 40 children at each site for a total of 240 out of 400 total participants.

501
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:41,639
And then our comparison group of the surveyed elementary school students will be 40 age matched,

502
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:45,420
randomly selected students that are currently enrolled in the after school program

503
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:49,500
at each site but have not ever and are not currently enrolled in the HLA program.

504
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:00,410
Our data collection will be available at this time.

505
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:04,220
And I stated before our process evaluation questionnaire will be entering into

506
00:57:04,250 --> 00:57:09,400
whether you completed the aging program as intended with regards to its limits.

507
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,430
So for the quantitative analysis part,

508
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:18,950
we will use paper and pencil to keep track of attendance at the number of students and teachers that attend each session.

509
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:27,860
The paper and pencil method is more suitable for location time, and it allows the teachers to take more responsibility.

510
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:35,880
The qualitative analysis in. And I thought your interview that I recorded where we will assess the teachers

511
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:40,560
experiences and better understand their attendance and barriers to completion of the.

512
00:57:45,370 --> 00:57:53,360
And important for outcome evaluation. Well, we'll be answering the questions of whether or not the program succeeded in helping to.

513
00:57:54,840 --> 00:58:01,440
There's no efficacy. And whether participants increase their proportion of fruit and veg will be in.

514
00:58:02,470 --> 00:58:05,560
So the quantitative data will come from anonymous self administration.

515
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:13,810
There may be aware that will collect information about the percentage of fruit and vegetables estimate student participants are eating.

516
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:18,910
The survey being administered via a web visible for a larger population size.

517
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:25,120
So we are collecting data from the school. The pre-testing process will be implemented for baseline.

518
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:34,490
And after intervention. It's imperative that the program will complete the survey as well.

519
00:58:34,790 --> 00:58:42,980
And then the qualitative data portion will be collected from a free resource survey to instill in self efficacy regarding healthy eating.

520
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:49,420
This will be administered prior to the program completion to report that the participants are comfortable sharing the.

521
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:54,950
And this will also allow us to survey as many. That's probably one of the reasons.

522
00:59:00,020 --> 00:59:04,970
So for analysis, we split it down into the process evaluation and the outcome evaluation.

523
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:09,140
So our process evaluation is very much focused on descriptive statistics.

524
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:14,690
So specifically looking at those attendance records, we want to know the rates of attendance overall in the program,

525
00:59:14,690 --> 00:59:20,390
but we also want to trend the rates throughout the program to look at the overall attrition of participants.

526
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:25,910
And then we also, as we mentioned, are going to be doing those interviews with different teen mentors.

527
00:59:25,910 --> 00:59:30,560
And so we're going to take our transcripts of those interviews and do some dramatic analyzes of the interviews.

528
00:59:30,950 --> 00:59:34,040
So really just get at our point of trying to figure out if there's any barriers

529
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:39,529
to participation for our teen mentors or protective factors for participation,

530
00:59:39,530 --> 00:59:45,110
and what really encouraged teen mentors to continue to be involved in this program?

531
00:59:46,010 --> 00:59:51,210
For outcome evaluation, we have also, once again, quantitative and qualitative methods.

532
00:59:51,230 --> 00:59:57,620
So our quantitative methods, it's really going to be looking at those pre and post tests for like the both the test of

533
00:59:57,620 --> 01:00:03,740
nutritional knowledge and also the surveys as well regarding healthy eating behaviors.

534
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:09,110
And these are going to be separated out by the elementary students and the teen age participants as well.

535
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:16,010
And the teenage participants also have questions that do get at the heart of the self efficacy piece.

536
01:00:16,490 --> 01:00:20,299
So for the self efficacy questions and those are going to be scaled items,

537
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:27,770
we are going to be doing Combats Alpha to ensure that there's internal consistency among those measures before doing further analyzes.

538
01:00:28,370 --> 01:00:31,669
And then between the elementary students alone,

539
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:36,200
we're going to do two simple T tests to look at differences in pre and post test and their

540
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:41,650
nutritional knowledge as well as pre and post test changes in their reported eating behaviors.

541
01:00:41,660 --> 01:00:44,900
And then we'll do that same process for the teen mentors as well.

542
01:00:45,230 --> 01:00:49,100
And then we also want to do a secondary analyzes looking at between group differences.

543
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:55,040
So we have our comparison group. So we want to see if there's any differences between our elementary students.

544
01:00:55,040 --> 01:01:00,110
Change in knowledge after the end of the program, who's per person?

545
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:02,029
People who participated in the program,

546
01:01:02,030 --> 01:01:09,350
as well as for our comparison group where they did not participate in the program and will do that same process for the teen mentors as well.

547
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:18,709
And then for our qualitative analysis, as we mentioned, we have that short essay response questions regarding self efficacy for the teen mentors

548
01:01:18,710 --> 01:01:22,370
that will once again be looking through that for content and thematic analysis,

549
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:27,799
just making sure we can get a more well-rounded picture of how the teens felt that their self advocacy

550
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:34,100
was improved and gives us different dimensions than just some of those skilled multi measure items.

551
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:45,300
And then finally for dissemination so similar to the last group are invested parties include parents and students,

552
01:01:45,630 --> 01:01:51,810
school community members such as school board members, teachers and then funders of the program,

553
01:01:51,810 --> 01:01:56,370
and also local government officials who also decide on funding.

554
01:01:57,120 --> 01:02:06,060
So we also similarly decided on different forms of communication to ensure dissemination to all of these broad different groups of invested parties.

555
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:12,330
So for a written report of our evaluation that would be disseminated to the local government officials,

556
01:02:12,330 --> 01:02:18,390
funders and school board, it'll be like exhaustive and thorough and more suited to that audience.

557
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:27,090
And then we will also have a hybrid meeting with Zoom and in-person options for parents in school community members like teachers,

558
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:33,389
so that people we can make it suited to that audience and make it accessible for parents.

559
01:02:33,390 --> 01:02:39,480
If they can't come in-person, they can attend via Zoom as well and learn more about the program and what we found in our evaluation.

560
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:47,849
And then we also would like to include our results in a school newsletter so that students can also learn about what we found about the program,

561
01:02:47,850 --> 01:02:57,070
and we will adapt it to that audience appropriately. And then just some general takeaway.

562
01:02:57,100 --> 01:03:04,350
So our goal is to assess the program using process evaluation, which will use the attendance and attrition.

563
01:03:04,950 --> 01:03:13,529
Our ultimate evaluation will use knowledge, behaviors and self-efficacy that the program and of six and six months of completion is when we

564
01:03:13,530 --> 01:03:19,380
will do those evaluations comparison between pre and post test and non equivalent control groups.

565
01:03:20,310 --> 01:03:25,200
Will be used in then. Qualitative and quantitative methods which we have covered.

566
01:03:46,790 --> 01:03:51,840
So. All right. I saw another hand about the corner, I.

567
01:03:52,490 --> 01:03:57,080
So I thought I was really interested in the previous survey.

568
01:03:57,620 --> 01:04:04,430
So it's curious as to how you would format that and and analyze it.

569
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:11,830
Yeah. I think for the four years long survey we talked about having the best questions and then just

570
01:04:11,830 --> 01:04:16,620
kind of having more of an open ended question that allows for students to expand upon that.

571
01:04:16,630 --> 01:04:20,370
So like, how did you feel this program empowered you, for example?

572
01:04:20,370 --> 01:04:26,979
It would be a question and then just giving students the opportunity to explain in their own words rather than just saying yes,

573
01:04:26,980 --> 01:04:35,110
I very much agree this program empowered me, but explain the particular elements of the program that were really important for building self efficacy.

574
01:04:35,110 --> 01:04:39,189
And then we want to go through and really look at the themes that emerge in that.

575
01:04:39,190 --> 01:04:42,849
And then I think that's also a really good point in which we would bring in like those

576
01:04:42,850 --> 01:04:47,470
teen mentors to help us really understand how we're analyzing that data as well.

577
01:04:48,670 --> 01:04:52,440
And I think we talked about the environment in which those interviews would take place,

578
01:04:52,450 --> 01:04:58,090
like making sure that they were comfortable and relaxed and conversational, not interrogated at all.

579
01:05:00,450 --> 01:05:04,980
You mean the interviews in the previous survey or the.

580
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:09,040
I think she means the teen mentor interviews also. But it's not.

581
01:05:09,210 --> 01:05:21,560
Yeah, it's separate, but a similar, I guess, analysis. I have another question.

582
01:05:22,490 --> 01:05:26,450
So you mentioned that the surveys would be anonymous.

583
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:32,660
So I'm curious, did you think about how you would feel, though, if it is an anonymous.

584
01:05:33,470 --> 01:05:38,710
Anonymous survey the pre post. Like that.

585
01:05:41,470 --> 01:05:42,370
I think for that,

586
01:05:42,820 --> 01:05:51,520
the goal would be to kind of have like an identifiable something that is not really an identifier but can help us know how we can match those.

587
01:05:51,520 --> 01:06:02,889
So we can ask for like first letter of your last name, date like your number, date of birth, like what day you were born and like something else,

588
01:06:02,890 --> 01:06:07,690
you know, to kind of help, we haven't defined clearly, but that's kind of we were thinking about of that kind of design.

589
01:06:07,690 --> 01:06:17,709
So that way we are able to accurately combine pre and post data, but without necessarily having to know like who the person is to ensure that.

590
01:06:17,710 --> 01:06:20,920
Anonymous I cannot say the word anonymity.

591
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:23,080
Um, yeah.

592
01:06:23,740 --> 01:06:33,430
In the sense that students will feel more comfortable, like accurately responding, especially when it comes to things such as like self efficacy,

593
01:06:33,430 --> 01:06:37,830
also with regard to like what they're eating so that we don't feel like that for at all.

594
01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:42,660
Someone's going to know exactly what I eat. Maybe I don't eat the bus right now, etc., etc.

595
01:06:42,670 --> 01:06:47,889
So I think that's kind of what we were thinking in terms of still being able to do pre and post,

596
01:06:47,890 --> 01:06:52,660
but without necessarily knowing the name survey or anything else like.

597
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:08,510
So at the end of a clear clarifying question, do you go back to the standpoints like.

598
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:13,780
I don't know how you do it. I think we can use.

599
01:07:14,460 --> 01:07:22,790
Oh, sorry. I. So are you sampling?

600
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:31,330
Your sampling from the participants or you sampling from when you do the sample random sampling.

601
01:07:32,020 --> 01:07:36,010
Are you sampling from the participants or are you.

602
01:07:36,460 --> 01:07:42,940
Yeah. So all the participants will be assigned like a random number and then of the participants will

603
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:47,770
randomly select like some of those numbers using a random number generator at each school.

604
01:07:48,130 --> 01:07:51,470
So then we don't have to necessarily capture everyone in case there's like

605
01:07:51,490 --> 01:07:54,580
people that are attending or something like that that makes it more difficult.

606
01:07:55,450 --> 01:08:01,610
So that was the plan that. All right.

607
01:08:01,830 --> 01:08:08,470
Well, thank you. Right.

608
01:08:08,490 --> 01:08:12,350
So that's all I for. What we have for today.

609
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:20,790
So now is what comes to the floor. So for those who are coming to other the.

610
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:29,890
Just, you know, if you didn't see the announcement today. It's a lot easier to just share the name.

611
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:35,610
Then I can just open up my on Google Drive. Sugar.

612
01:08:37,590 --> 01:08:41,230
Oh, my home. Yeah.

613
01:08:41,530 --> 01:08:47,320
So I will stick around if anybody has any questions for.

614
01:08:48,420 --> 01:08:52,200
You know, I stick around through office hours here. I'm usually here to 1145.

615
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:58,140
They never reserve room besides. Arguing with the liberal.

616
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:04,330
It's all because 1145 people have questions and.

617
01:09:05,410 --> 01:09:09,120
If you sent me an email in the past 24 hours, I will also be able to.

618
01:09:11,190 --> 01:09:16,380
All right. Have a good day. Thank you. And thank you for questioning your take on this.

619
01:09:31,910 --> 01:09:48,460
Yeah. Yes.

620
01:09:48,740 --> 01:09:52,700
I guess if you can. Yeah.

621
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:55,940
Because I told her. Yeah, you're right.

622
01:09:56,050 --> 01:10:08,600
I was like, Wait. So there is.

623
01:10:22,990 --> 01:10:45,190
But I like the. I know.

624
01:10:45,390 --> 01:10:49,630
I know you won't be elsewhere.

625
01:10:50,710 --> 01:10:54,200
But I can see.

626
01:11:05,700 --> 01:11:21,690
And in that sense, I have to say that I.

627
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:29,530
But you know.

628
01:11:32,940 --> 01:11:50,110
But yeah I think I don't think I look at large events and was not.

629
01:11:55,250 --> 01:11:59,050
It's not that many.

630
01:12:11,330 --> 01:12:45,310
Yeah. So by saying so, let me pick up up so you can take it away because I have heard sort.

631
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:58,440
Exactly right. Yes. If you look at the last.

632
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:07,150
Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

633
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:33,710
There's always a percentage of the I would probably be 3320 year olds.

634
01:13:44,730 --> 01:13:48,900
We saw you go.

635
01:13:52,880 --> 01:14:07,540
So let's just put it out there saying, you know what this looks.

636
01:14:11,830 --> 01:14:18,310
I was like, this is why I think.

637
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:27,710
You know that, right?

638
01:14:29,230 --> 01:14:33,280
Yeah, she.

639
01:14:34,700 --> 01:14:38,999
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

640
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:46,380
I said I told you I don't know all that [INAUDIBLE] time and I told her to talk to you.

641
01:14:48,380 --> 01:14:54,270
Okay, I know.

642
01:14:54,300 --> 01:15:01,350
It's like, well, I have something to say.

643
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:18,110
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

644
01:15:19,340 --> 01:15:26,040
You know, I actually have, like, one person.

645
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:39,230
What are you waiting for?

646
01:15:49,100 --> 01:16:02,360
You know. I really think that you're right.

647
01:16:08,650 --> 01:16:12,180
No where I was.

648
01:16:22,420 --> 01:16:28,950
I feel like this.

649
01:16:31,140 --> 01:16:37,100
They have a lot of.

650
01:16:44,950 --> 01:16:49,870
I got this one.

651
01:16:52,640 --> 01:17:17,380
I. Yeah, I know.

652
01:17:20,950 --> 01:17:25,690
I mean, you.

653
01:17:30,580 --> 01:18:04,550
When I was running for office, I met you, and I don't, actually.

654
01:18:11,460 --> 01:18:25,610
So it's something that and I think.

655
01:18:33,180 --> 01:18:43,010
Here, you. Oh, it's just.

656
01:18:43,250 --> 01:18:52,550
You know what I want to do with whatever was happening?

657
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:18,640
We've got to do something, but really, really hard to get.

658
01:19:24,810 --> 01:19:32,320
How to quote.

659
01:19:33,750 --> 01:19:39,300
Oh yea, yea, yea yea.

660
01:19:39,810 --> 01:19:49,980
I got. Okay.

661
01:19:50,370 --> 01:19:57,790
So that was a little bit about that I guess I thought that.
