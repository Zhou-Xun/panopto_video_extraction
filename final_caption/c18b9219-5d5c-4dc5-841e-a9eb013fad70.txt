00:00:01,146 --> 00:00:06,717
Variance analysis is an examination and
interpretation of what was expected

2
00:00:06,717 --> 00:00:14,077
to happen, as specified in the budget,
with what actually happened.

3
00:00:14,077 --> 00:00:18,680
Variance analysis allows managers
to answer questions such as,

4
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:23,542
why was our department's actual
profit less than what we budgeted?

5
00:00:23,542 --> 00:00:27,566
Why did our department earn
larger revenues than we budgeted?

6
00:00:27,566 --> 00:00:32,070
Why did our department incur
higher costs than we budgeted?

7
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:36,460
Variance analysis is an essential
part of the budgeting process.

8
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:42,030
Its primary goal is not to assign
blame for unfavorable results.

9
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:48,130
Rather, variance analysis aims to uncover
the causes of operational problems,

10
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:52,680
so that they can be avoided or
at least minimized in the future.

11
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:57,880
Actions taken by managers in response to
variance analysis, have the potential

12
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:03,805
to dramatically improve the operations and
financial performance of an organization.

13
00:01:03,805 --> 00:01:08,380
Variance analysis involves
comparing two amounts, an actual or

14
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:11,640
realized value, and a budgeted value.

15
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:17,340
The difference between these two values is
what financial managers call the variance.

16
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:22,080
Let's use the following example to
conduct simple variance analysis for

17
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,310
a community health center.

18
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:27,040
Let's start by computing
the profit variance,

19
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:32,070
since profit is the most important
single line on the operating budget.

20
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:36,380
The profit variance is computed as
the difference between actual profit and

21
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,240
budgeted profit.

22
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:43,989
In general, variances are calculated so
that positive amounts signify good or

23
00:01:43,989 --> 00:01:49,587
desirable results, while negative
amounts of bad or undesirable results.

24
00:01:49,587 --> 00:01:55,406
In this example the profit
variances equals $585

25
00:01:55,406 --> 00:02:00,457
minus $600, which is equal to- $15.

26
00:02:00,457 --> 00:02:05,476
This means that the center's profit
was $15 lower than expected,

27
00:02:05,476 --> 00:02:09,110
which is a bad or undesirable result.

28
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:13,483
Let's conduct additional analysis to
determine what caused this lower than

29
00:02:13,483 --> 00:02:14,566
expected profit.

30
00:02:14,566 --> 00:02:19,622
Was it the cost of revenue shortfall,
cost overruns, or both?

31
00:02:19,622 --> 00:02:22,598
Let's take a closer look
at the revenue side.

32
00:02:22,598 --> 00:02:28,063
The revenue variance is defined as
the difference between actual revenues and

33
00:02:28,063 --> 00:02:29,560
budgeted revenues.

34
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:35,178
In this example, $2,535 minus

35
00:02:35,178 --> 00:02:40,096
$2,400 equals $135.

36
00:02:40,096 --> 00:02:45,856
This means that the center's revenues
were $135 greater than budgeted.

37
00:02:45,856 --> 00:02:48,950
Now let's take a look at the expense side.

38
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:54,430
The expense variance is defined as
budgeted expenses minus actual expenses.

39
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:59,515
Note that we had to reverse the
calculation here, to show that higher than

40
00:02:59,515 --> 00:03:05,431
budgeted expenses are bad, or undesirable,
and hence create a negative variance.

41
00:03:05,431 --> 00:03:10,191
In this example, $1,800 minus

42
00:03:10,191 --> 00:03:14,660
$1,950 equals -$150.

43
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:20,704
This means that the center's expenses
were $150 greater than budgeted.

44
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:24,922
By breaking down the center's profit
variance into the revenue and

45
00:03:24,922 --> 00:03:29,214
the expense variance, it is readily
apparent that the major cause of

46
00:03:29,214 --> 00:03:34,815
the center's poor financial performance
was that costs were too high.
