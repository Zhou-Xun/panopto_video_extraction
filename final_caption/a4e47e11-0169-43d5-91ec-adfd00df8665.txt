00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:13,999
Today we're gonna continue building your reflective listening skills.

2
00:00:13,999 --> 00:00:19,912
In this case, the context will be speaking with an adolescent about their weight,

3
00:00:19,912 --> 00:00:23,041
their diet, and their physical activity.

4
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:25,881
Let's begin by looking at this client.

5
00:00:25,881 --> 00:00:35,782
In this case, it's an adolescent struggling with his or her weight.

6
00:00:35,782 --> 00:00:39,085
So let's look at a traditional directive response.

7
00:00:39,085 --> 00:00:43,526
Well, you can exercise at home, ride your bike, ask your parents,

8
00:00:43,526 --> 00:00:45,685
eat some salads, bring snacks.

9
00:00:45,685 --> 00:00:49,015
Now this may seem innocuous, anodyne, but

10
00:00:49,015 --> 00:00:53,523
it's actually in our world, a pretty negative response.

11
00:00:53,523 --> 00:00:56,211
It's just arguing, it's unsolicited advice.

12
00:00:56,211 --> 00:01:01,366
And it misses all the struggle, all the emotions, all the resistance that we

13
00:01:01,366 --> 00:01:06,779
wanna reflect is completely absent from this traditional directive response.

14
00:01:06,779 --> 00:01:11,960
So why don't you go ahead and generate a reflection to this client's statement?

15
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:23,679
Take a minute to do so.

16
00:01:23,679 --> 00:01:28,064
So now, let's take a look at a response that we generated.

17
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:29,697
There's a lot going on here.

18
00:01:29,697 --> 00:01:31,342
Let's unpack it.

19
00:01:31,342 --> 00:01:35,523
Well, you're starting to think it's time to do something about your weight and

20
00:01:35,523 --> 00:01:37,624
you know it might be good for you, okay?

21
00:01:37,624 --> 00:01:41,570
That's change talk, that's the positive side of a double sided reflection.

22
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:46,011
However, here's the other side, but fitting it in seems almost impossible.

23
00:01:46,011 --> 00:01:49,047
So now we've done a double sided reflection.

24
00:01:49,047 --> 00:01:51,585
Then we're gonna do something that we've mentioned earlier, but

25
00:01:51,585 --> 00:01:53,111
never actually showing you an example.

26
00:01:53,111 --> 00:01:56,581
But here it is, the gym isn't an option, crossing it out.

27
00:01:56,581 --> 00:02:00,097
Think about seeing a line, a strikethrough right between the gym.

28
00:02:00,097 --> 00:02:02,168
And we roll with the resistance again,

29
00:02:02,168 --> 00:02:05,318
you can't think of any friends who would work out with you.

30
00:02:05,318 --> 00:02:09,326
And finally we end on the positive with a little piece of change talk, but

31
00:02:09,326 --> 00:02:12,166
it's something you're starting to think about.

32
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:15,685
We'll talk more later this semester about the tentative nature of this statement.

33
00:02:15,685 --> 00:02:21,958
Starting to think about and why we're so careful to use such cautious language.

34
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:24,781
All right, let's move on.

35
00:02:24,781 --> 00:02:26,961
Here's the prompt from the teen.

36
00:02:26,961 --> 00:02:43,545
Go ahead, generate your reflection.

37
00:02:43,545 --> 00:02:45,357
What did you come up with?

38
00:02:45,357 --> 00:02:50,203
Well, here's the not so good version.

39
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:56,104
Argument unsolicited advice, I doubt any of you came close to this one.

40
00:02:56,104 --> 00:02:59,145
And here's an MI response.

41
00:02:59,145 --> 00:03:03,142
You've tried a lot of things, put a lot of effort into this, but

42
00:03:03,142 --> 00:03:05,670
you're starting to feel discouraged.

43
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:09,985
And you also feel that your mom is a bit controlling about your weight.

44
00:03:09,985 --> 00:03:14,154
Then inching towards change, you're starting to wonder if there's a better

45
00:03:14,154 --> 00:03:22,141
way, particularly a way to do this without feeling deprived.

46
00:03:22,141 --> 00:03:29,418
Here's another prompt.

47
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:44,270
Generate your reflection.

48
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:51,096
Directive, misses all emotions, unsolicited advice.

49
00:03:51,096 --> 00:03:55,165
Not an MI response, is it?

50
00:03:55,165 --> 00:03:59,394
Here's an MI response, rolling with resistance.

51
00:03:59,394 --> 00:04:01,898
It's tough for you to eat healthier.

52
00:04:01,898 --> 00:04:04,555
Then on the bottom part, affirmation.

53
00:04:04,555 --> 00:04:09,312
You care about your health and then again, inching towards change.

54
00:04:09,312 --> 00:04:17,382
You're starting to think about eating better.

55
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:24,164
Generate your reflection.

56
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:27,600
Pay particular attention to those last few words.

57
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:35,584
I will deal with this my way, see what you can do with that one.

58
00:04:35,584 --> 00:04:43,786
Traditional directive, basically arguing with her.

59
00:04:43,786 --> 00:04:45,915
MI response.

60
00:04:45,915 --> 00:04:49,854
You feel they're judging you, you feel they're controlling,

61
00:04:49,854 --> 00:04:52,155
you feel you're under a microscope.

62
00:04:52,155 --> 00:04:57,233
It's annoying, however, part of you is interested in this.

63
00:04:57,233 --> 00:05:00,990
This is that little fragment of change talk, but more importantly,

64
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:04,378
that last part of this, you're gonna do it on your own terms.

65
00:05:04,378 --> 00:05:12,887
Affirm her autonomous drive that if she is gonna do it, she's gonna do it on her own.

66
00:05:12,887 --> 00:05:17,580
So today we further refine your reflective listening skills using

67
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:21,444
examples of adolescents with overweight or obesity.

68
00:05:21,444 --> 00:05:28,528
In future sessions we'll apply these same skills to other health content.
