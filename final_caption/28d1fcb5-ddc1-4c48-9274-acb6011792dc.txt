1
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,340
In this module,
I'll be describing

2
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:14,025
some challenges related
to air pollution.

3
00:00:14,025 --> 00:00:15,270
But before I do that,

4
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:16,770
think about the last
time you checked

5
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,710
your phone or a website
for the weather.

6
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,270
You probably checked for

7
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:22,560
the weather forecasts to see

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,920
what you should wear that day,

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,320
but did you notice that

10
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,330
virtually every app
and website out

11
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,620
there also has an air quality
index or AQI listed there.

12
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:33,025
If you did notice this,

13
00:00:33,025 --> 00:00:34,725
you may also have realized that

14
00:00:34,725 --> 00:00:37,515
AQI number can change
pretty dramatically

15
00:00:37,515 --> 00:00:39,330
over a relatively short period of

16
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,605
time and also over a
relatively short distance.

17
00:00:42,605 --> 00:00:45,440
So the ability of air
pollution to change

18
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,865
rapidly over time and space

19
00:00:46,865 --> 00:00:48,409
is one of the main challenges,

20
00:00:48,409 --> 00:00:51,170
but not the only challenge
we face in trying to

21
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:53,195
understand the environmental
health impacts

22
00:00:53,195 --> 00:00:55,130
of air pollutants.

23
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:57,350
If we review some of the primary

24
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:59,150
global air pollution problems,

25
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:00,800
there's really five
that come to mind.

26
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,680
The first is stratospheric
ozone depletion,

27
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,320
causing additional ultraviolet
radiation exposure

28
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,775
to people at ground level.

29
00:01:07,775 --> 00:01:10,280
The second is atmospheric
deposition of

30
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,000
things like mercury and
persistent organic pollutants,

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,500
this meaning that those
pollutants can get into the air,

32
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,700
move around the atmosphere,

33
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,530
and then deposit
far away from where

34
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:20,755
they were originally created.

35
00:01:20,755 --> 00:01:22,790
Urban smog is the third with

36
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:26,120
a primary focus on
particulate matter and ozone.

37
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,985
Climate change is an
enormous fourth one here

38
00:01:28,985 --> 00:01:31,925
driven primarily by
greenhouse gas emissions,

39
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:35,750
and a fifth one is indoor
air pollution in households.

40
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:37,580
So if we look at this list,

41
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:40,175
you probably notice
that three of these are

42
00:01:40,175 --> 00:01:43,415
a direct result of
fossil fuel emissions.

43
00:01:43,415 --> 00:01:44,870
Now despite the fact that we

44
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,250
know fossil fuel emissions are

45
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,950
driving some of our worst
air pollution problems,

46
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,630
the use of some categories of

47
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:53,480
fossil fuels has
continued to grow.

48
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,280
On this graph we're looking at

49
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,490
energy consumption by source
for the entire world.

50
00:01:58,490 --> 00:01:59,900
So on the y-axis here,

51
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,179
you'll see the amount of
energy being consumed,

52
00:02:02,179 --> 00:02:05,900
on the x-axis, we're
going from 1990 to 2015,

53
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,660
these are data which we
have available and from

54
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:11,750
2015 to 2040 these
are projections,

55
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,150
and then the lines you see
on this graph correspond to

56
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,805
different types of
energy sources.

57
00:02:16,805 --> 00:02:18,620
So there's some good
news on this graph,

58
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:21,815
the green line, renewables
is increasing over time,

59
00:02:21,815 --> 00:02:23,270
and the dark line,

60
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:25,460
coal has actually stabilized,

61
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:28,205
in fact started to reduce
slightly over time.

62
00:02:28,205 --> 00:02:30,830
So that means more
clean energy coming

63
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:33,710
online and less use of
coal. That's the good news.

64
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:36,140
The bad news is that natural gas

65
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,930
and petroleum and other
liquids are projected to

66
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:41,270
continue to increase
over time and

67
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:44,360
Nuclear Energy at the very
bottom of the graph which is

68
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,120
clean and doesn't produce
any fossil fuels is

69
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,160
relatively stable
historically and

70
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,340
is not projected to grow.

71
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,620
So beyond energy sources,

72
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,190
which are very strongly linked to

73
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,760
challenges and
exposure assessment,

74
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,610
we have other challenges as well.

75
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:00,270
One of them is low
exposure levels.

76
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:02,240
While there are certainly
areas around the world that

77
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,310
it can have quite
high air pollution,

78
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:06,695
most of us have
relatively low levels.

79
00:03:06,695 --> 00:03:09,170
Higher levels are
easier to connect to

80
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:10,970
exposure impacts because
the health effects

81
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:12,395
tend to be more obvious,

82
00:03:12,395 --> 00:03:14,390
Bub these chronic
low level exposures

83
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:16,970
can be quite challenging
to understand.

84
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:19,505
A second challenge is a
mixture of chemicals.

85
00:03:19,505 --> 00:03:21,380
Air pollution is not
a single chemical,

86
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,990
it's thousands of chemicals
and trying to understand

87
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:27,205
the individual impacts of
each is very very difficult.

88
00:03:27,205 --> 00:03:29,870
Third, we have extremely
large variability in

89
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:32,695
air pollutants over
time and over space.

90
00:03:32,695 --> 00:03:35,290
Fourth, we have multiple
exposure routes.

91
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:36,920
So some types of
pollution that we

92
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,110
might breathe in like lead,

93
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:42,080
could also come into
us in other ways.

94
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,940
So for example we
may inhale lead,

95
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:46,520
but we might also be
eating lead on food

96
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,505
that's been contaminated
or drinking lead in water.

97
00:03:49,505 --> 00:03:51,230
So these multiple
exposure routes for

98
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:52,670
a particular pollutant make

99
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:54,790
this job even more challenging.

100
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:57,500
Finally, we have very
long-term exposures.

101
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,885
It can be relatively
simple to understand

102
00:03:59,885 --> 00:04:02,270
a single air
pollutant that you're

103
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:04,810
exposed to over a single
short amount of time,

104
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:06,860
but as we start to
think about years or

105
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,990
decades or even a
lifetime exposure,

106
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:11,690
the uncertainties
grow quite large.

107
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:13,880
We also have challenges in

108
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,070
assessing the impacts
of the many policies

109
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,765
we put into place to try to

110
00:04:17,765 --> 00:04:19,955
protect our health
from air pollutants.

111
00:04:19,955 --> 00:04:22,010
So one is that changes in

112
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:25,175
air pollution levels
occur slowly over time.

113
00:04:25,175 --> 00:04:28,040
A second is that the sources
of air pollution change

114
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,210
over time due to different
economic factors.

115
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:33,860
A third again, is that
health effects might be

116
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:37,100
caused by multiple exposures
not just air pollution.

117
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,330
So again with that example of

118
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:40,730
lead is that the lead
your breathing in or

119
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,230
the lead your
drinking or the lead

120
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:43,635
contaminating your food that's

121
00:04:43,635 --> 00:04:45,080
causing the health outcome.

122
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,430
Of course it's all three in

123
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:48,949
combination but one of
them might be primary,

124
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:50,590
and we tried to understand that.

125
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:53,270
Finally, I want to
highlight the complexity of

126
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:56,569
the standard setting and
policy making process,

127
00:04:56,569 --> 00:04:59,300
and I'm going to do this by
highlighting the process for

128
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,160
revising the National Ambient Air

129
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,740
Quality Standards or NAAQS.

130
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:06,500
So here we're looking
at a very complex graph

131
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,690
that we'll walk
through in detail,

132
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:10,070
and again this is an overview of

133
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:12,050
the process the Environmental
Protection Agency

134
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:15,605
goes through to review the
NAAQS for potential update.

135
00:05:15,605 --> 00:05:17,450
So we'll focus on the blue boxes

136
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,460
in the center of the
graph to begin with,

137
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:22,700
the starting step here is
an Integrated Review plan.

138
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,275
This is basically setting forth

139
00:05:24,275 --> 00:05:26,480
the timeline and also trying to

140
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,220
identify what are the key policy

141
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,635
relevant in scientific questions.

142
00:05:30,635 --> 00:05:32,465
The next step down

143
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:35,090
blue box is an integrated
science assessments.

144
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:37,550
So this is an evaluation
and a synthesis of

145
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:40,565
the policy relevant studies
that are available.

146
00:05:40,565 --> 00:05:43,540
The third step is a risk
and exposure assessments.

147
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:46,730
We want to quantify how much
and how often are people

148
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:50,224
exposed to these NAAQS
criteria air pollutants,

149
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:53,600
focusing on key results and
also identify uncertainties,

150
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,640
what don't we know, and then

151
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,990
the fourth layer of blue
boxes is a policy assessment.

152
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:02,690
So this is a staff analysis
by EPA staffers on

153
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:04,775
the different policy
options that might be

154
00:06:04,775 --> 00:06:07,595
available to
potentially consider.

155
00:06:07,595 --> 00:06:09,980
I want to highlight
there's inputs on all of

156
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,390
these blue boxes from

157
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:13,760
various agencies
including in yellow,

158
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:17,330
the Clean Air Scientific
Advisory Committee of the EPA.

159
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:19,610
So they're going to be
reviewing each of these steps

160
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:22,250
and you'll notice there's also
a box for public comment.

161
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:25,475
We want the public to be able
to provide input as well.

162
00:06:25,475 --> 00:06:27,410
When we transitioned
from the blue part

163
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:28,890
of the graphic to the green part,

164
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:30,410
here you can see we start to

165
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:32,420
enter agency decision-making so

166
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,949
the staff are preparing

167
00:06:33,949 --> 00:06:37,175
to make changes that
might be necessary,

168
00:06:37,175 --> 00:06:39,140
the staff at the EPA
are also going to

169
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,060
have review by other agencies.

170
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,745
So this is a so-called
inter-agency review.

171
00:06:43,745 --> 00:06:46,580
Then the EPA is going to
propose discussions on

172
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,790
the standards that they think
should be put into place.

173
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:51,080
We'll have another set of

174
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,255
public hearings and input there.

175
00:06:53,255 --> 00:06:55,910
Then the agency will
actually make its decision

176
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:57,860
synthesizing all of this input

177
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,465
they've gotten along the way,

178
00:06:59,465 --> 00:07:01,610
there will be another
inter-agency review.

179
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:03,140
So other professionals in

180
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:06,185
the federal government putting
their eyes on the policy,

181
00:07:06,185 --> 00:07:07,760
and then finally the decision is

182
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,535
made and whatever
changes are implemented.

183
00:07:10,535 --> 00:07:13,580
So you can see this is
a quite complex process

184
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:16,915
with many many steps and
many parties involved.

185
00:07:16,915 --> 00:07:19,460
So policy making is challenging

186
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,590
and it can certainly
take a very long time,

187
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:22,700
but I don't want
to leave you with

188
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,410
the impression that
it's not effective.

189
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,000
So here are two examples of where

190
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,160
policies have been
extremely effective.

191
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,290
These policies
specifically focusing on

192
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:32,855
reducing lead exposure
in the public.

193
00:07:32,855 --> 00:07:34,640
In the left-hand graphic
we're looking at

194
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,560
the United States and we can see

195
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,249
here two types of lead that
are represented in green,

196
00:07:40,249 --> 00:07:43,400
we have the lead that is
allowed to be used in

197
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,955
gasoline between 1975 and 1980,

198
00:07:46,955 --> 00:07:49,985
and in red we have the
average blood lead levels

199
00:07:49,985 --> 00:07:52,750
of Americans sampled
for this purpose.

200
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,950
So you can see in 1975,

201
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:57,065
the EPA basically
started to phase

202
00:07:57,065 --> 00:08:00,605
out lead in gasoline, in 1977,

203
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,570
the Consumer Product
Safety Commission or

204
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:05,020
CPSC banned lead-based paint,

205
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,110
and you can see with

206
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:09,335
these two actions the
decline in the green line,

207
00:08:09,335 --> 00:08:13,310
lead used in gasoline became
pretty precipitous after

208
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:16,460
about 1978 and the
average blood lead levels

209
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:19,010
in America declined at
basically the same rate.

210
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:21,530
So we elected to eliminate lead

211
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:24,140
in two important sources,
and in this case,

212
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:26,180
one of them leaded gasoline
seems to have made

213
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,490
a huge difference in terms of

214
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:31,750
improving public health by
reducing blood lead levels.

215
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,790
In the right, we see a
graphic from South Korea,

216
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:36,830
and again here we
have represented

217
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:39,140
in the blue and red circles,

218
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,670
blood lead levels measured

219
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:42,320
in adults and children over time,

220
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,230
and in green we have the
ambient air lead levels.

221
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:49,580
So South Korea was later to
adopt a leaded gasoline ban.

222
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,500
Theirs didn't really
come into effect until

223
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,020
the late 80's and early 1990's,

224
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,030
but you can see the green line

225
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,530
starts to drop precipitously

226
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:00,140
once leaded gas is
eliminated and you

227
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:03,335
can see the blood lead levels
declined along with that.

228
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:05,420
While policy making
is challenging

229
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,520
and exposure assessment
is challenging as well,

230
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,590
both of these steps
are key for us to do

231
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:13,237
a better job at promoting
environmental health.
