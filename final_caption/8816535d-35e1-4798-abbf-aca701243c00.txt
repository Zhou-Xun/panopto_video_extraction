00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:10,305
After watching this video,

2
00:00:10,305 --> 00:00:11,700
you will be able to describe

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,300
the multiple imputation methods
to handle missing data.

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,740
These are the methods to
deal with missing data.

5
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:20,295
They're not so good ones,

6
00:00:20,295 --> 00:00:22,080
but very often use.

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,045
Are Complete Case Analysis.

8
00:00:24,045 --> 00:00:25,860
What you did this
so far, just delete

9
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,680
the observations with missing
data, and this is fine.

10
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,810
If they're missing
completely at random.

11
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,445
Then the Missing Indicators,

12
00:00:32,445 --> 00:00:34,980
you create an indicator
or dummy variable

13
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,860
for the missing data and
enter that in the model.

14
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,450
This one can be biased

15
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,715
even if missing
completely at random.

16
00:00:41,715 --> 00:00:43,720
Then the single
imputation of the mean,

17
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,140
which can also be biased

18
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,050
even if missing
completely at random.

19
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:48,690
The good ones are,

20
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,045
multiple imputation
and others like

21
00:00:51,045 --> 00:00:54,025
using maximum likelihood
or weighting.

22
00:00:54,025 --> 00:00:55,475
In this course, we will focus

23
00:00:55,475 --> 00:00:58,615
exclusively on
multiple imputation.

24
00:00:58,615 --> 00:01:01,395
I'm quoting from
the sales manual.

25
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:04,340
"Multiple imputation does not

26
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:07,520
attempt to estimate each
missing values through

27
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,250
simulated values but rather to

28
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:14,435
represent a random sample
of the missing values.

29
00:01:14,435 --> 00:01:16,160
This process results in

30
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,800
valid statistical inferences that

31
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,445
properly reflect the uncertainty
due to missing values.

32
00:01:22,445 --> 00:01:24,590
For example, confidence
intervals with

33
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:27,079
the correct
probability coverage."

34
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:30,995
We are not making up
data, believe me.

35
00:01:30,995 --> 00:01:35,135
Multiple imputation using
SAS involves three steps.

36
00:01:35,135 --> 00:01:38,105
First, you impute using PROC MI.

37
00:01:38,105 --> 00:01:40,400
Imputing those values,
the rule of thumb is

38
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,515
that you will use 25 data sets.

39
00:01:42,515 --> 00:01:44,870
That's what SAAS uses by default.

40
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:49,235
Then you have to do the
analysis in every data set.

41
00:01:49,235 --> 00:01:51,050
You have to do your PROC REG,

42
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:53,240
if you are doing linear
aggregation or PROC LOGISTIC,

43
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,885
if you are doing logistic
regression and so on.

44
00:01:55,885 --> 00:01:58,160
You use the by underscore

45
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,770
imputation underscore
variable in the procedure.

46
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:04,150
You calculate 25 point estimates.

47
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:06,470
Finally, the first step is to

48
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:10,280
combine the result
using PROC MIANALYZE.

49
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,305
You combine the 25 estimates
into a unique one.

50
00:02:14,305 --> 00:02:18,140
This is a visual representation
of the previous steps.

51
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,735
From the original data
set with missing values,

52
00:02:20,735 --> 00:02:23,060
you will generate a
number of imputing

53
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:26,510
data sets and SAS by
default will do 25.

54
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:31,015
Then you will analyze every
single imputing data set.

55
00:02:31,015 --> 00:02:32,450
In the final step,

56
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:34,565
you will pull all the results

57
00:02:34,565 --> 00:02:37,700
into a unique final estimate.

58
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,955
The process itself is
not that complicated,

59
00:02:40,955 --> 00:02:43,330
but how do you
impute those values?

60
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,560
Well, you need to
choose variables

61
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,265
that will help you to
impute the missing data.

62
00:02:48,265 --> 00:02:51,980
The idea as a general rule
is to use anything that you

63
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,360
think it will help you to

64
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,570
predict the missing
values in your variables.

65
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:58,625
For example, if you have
missing in the income variable,

66
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:00,890
you can use a location,

67
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:02,525
you can use age,

68
00:03:02,525 --> 00:03:05,500
sex, area residents, etc.

69
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,635
In summary, in this video,

70
00:03:07,635 --> 00:03:09,950
we learned about the
multiple imputation method

71
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,405
to handle missing data.

72
00:03:11,405 --> 00:03:13,700
In the next video, we
will continue with

73
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:17,355
an example in SAS using
PROC MI and PROC MIANALYZE.
