1
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:09,240
Understanding how our genetics
impact our risk for disease and

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,980
other health outcomes is
incredibly complicated.

3
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:16,510
Not only do we have thousands
of genes per person, but

4
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:21,220
genes have varied forms, known as
the alleles, that we discussed earlier.

5
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:25,370
Some genetic studies examine
whether a specific allele of a gene

6
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:27,920
is associated with a health outcome.

7
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,520
When we do this, we classify
individuals as either heterozygous or

8
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,980
homozygous for a given allele.

9
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,420
To be heterozygous for

10
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,390
a given allele means that you
have one copy of that allele.

11
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:44,085
To be homozygous means that you have
two copies of that given allele.

12
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:47,240
And because we get an allele
from each of our parents,

13
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:52,079
it tells us something about whether we get
one copy, from just one of our parents,

14
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,790
or whether we get two copies, so
a copy from each of our parents.

15
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:00,710
Thus, this information can help us
understand whether the number of inherited

16
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:03,510
alleles is associated with disease, and

17
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:07,790
also tells us about the carrier
status of our parents.

18
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:11,610
Looking at the patterning of alleles
across individuals can be helpful for

19
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:16,110
health outcomes that are impacted
by changes in a single gene.

20
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,644
These are known as single gene traits.

21
00:01:18,644 --> 00:01:21,595
Single gene traits can either be dominant,

22
00:01:21,595 --> 00:01:26,070
meaning you only need one copy of
a given allele to have that trait.

23
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,603
Or they can be recessive,

24
00:01:27,603 --> 00:01:32,219
meaning that both copies of the allele
must be present to result in that trait.

25
00:01:32,219 --> 00:01:37,722
Hereditary disorders are those that
are caused by inheriting sets of alleles,

26
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:40,020
or even just a single allele, and

27
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:46,130
result in a production of defective
proteins, or no protein at all.

28
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:50,630
With these conditions, we can map out
the affected status of families to help us

29
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:53,603
understand the inheritance patterns for
disease.

30
00:01:53,603 --> 00:01:57,478
This information can help in
our planning and response.

31
00:01:57,478 --> 00:02:01,832
As well as tell us about how
those proteins, or lack thereof,

32
00:02:01,832 --> 00:02:08,240
are related to the pathophysiology and
the etiology of disease.

33
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:12,730
Some single gene disorders are what
are called autosomal dominant.

34
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:17,520
Autosomal dominant traits mean that
they are related to different alleles on

35
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,080
autosomal chromosomes, or
the non-sex-linked chromosomes.

36
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,060
Dominant means that we only need
one copy of the allele in question,

37
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,100
to have the trait produced.

38
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,720
So that means that we only need
to have one affected parent.

39
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,380
If a parent is affected with
an autosomal dominant trait,

40
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:40,460
they have a chance of passing that
allele to their offspring, and

41
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:44,340
then resulting in their
offspring having that trait.

42
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,579
Because of the autosomal nature of these
types of conditions, meaning they're not

43
00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:54,260
on sex-linked chromosomes, both males and
females are affected equally.

44
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:57,130
For an offspring to have
an autosomal dominant trait,

45
00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:02,200
they must have at least one parent
that is heterozygous for that trait.

46
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:06,910
Meaning that their parent has to have
least one copy of that allele, and

47
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:09,150
then they can have one
normal parent as well.

48
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,879
Because it's a dominant trait,
you only need one copy.

49
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:15,750
You can, of course, have parents
who both are carriers for that.

50
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:19,907
And then the likelihood of having
an autosomal dominant condition in

51
00:03:19,907 --> 00:03:21,849
the offspring would be higher.

52
00:03:21,849 --> 00:03:26,301
But let's assume that you have one
heterozygous parent for a trait,

53
00:03:26,301 --> 00:03:27,844
and one normal parent.

54
00:03:27,844 --> 00:03:32,029
That offspring, then,
would have a 50% chance of being affected.

55
00:03:32,029 --> 00:03:36,736
It has a 50% chance of getting the
affected allele from their first parent,

56
00:03:36,736 --> 00:03:41,371
and then it has a 0% chance of getting
that affected allele from their normal

57
00:03:41,371 --> 00:03:41,966
parent.

58
00:03:41,966 --> 00:03:45,482
But they only need one allele
to have the trait, and so

59
00:03:45,482 --> 00:03:50,310
then they would have a 50%
chance of being affected.

60
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:55,530
Examples of autosomal dominant conditions
include Huntington's disease and

61
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:58,510
osteogenesis imperfecta.

62
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:02,134
We can also look at conditions called
autosomal recessive conditions.

63
00:04:02,134 --> 00:04:03,733
Like autosomal dominant,

64
00:04:03,733 --> 00:04:08,606
these conditions arise from the autosomal
chromosomes, so not the sex-linked.

65
00:04:08,606 --> 00:04:11,487
But they're different in that
they're recessive, and so

66
00:04:11,487 --> 00:04:15,245
unlike autosomal dominant, where we
only need one parent that is a carrier.

67
00:04:15,245 --> 00:04:19,906
Autosomal recessive conditions require
both parents to be carriers of that

68
00:04:19,906 --> 00:04:21,080
affected allele.

69
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:25,732
Again, because it's autosomal dominant,
males and females are affected equally.

70
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:29,193
But in this case, if we have both
parents that are carriers for

71
00:04:29,193 --> 00:04:32,734
that affected allele,
meaning they're both heterozygous.

72
00:04:32,734 --> 00:04:37,973
Their offspring would have a 25% chance
of inheriting those two alleles.

73
00:04:37,973 --> 00:04:42,190
And so conditions that we see that
are autosomal recessive include

74
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:46,192
conditions such as sickle-cell anemia and
cystic fibrosis.

75
00:04:46,192 --> 00:04:50,804
Unlike our autosomal dominant and
autosomal recessive conditions,

76
00:04:50,804 --> 00:04:56,507
which are due to alleles of the autosomal
chromosomes, or the non-sex chromosomes,

77
00:04:56,507 --> 00:05:01,550
our sex-linked disorders are due
to genes on the sex chromosomes.

78
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:04,020
And if you recall, both males and

79
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:07,920
females have different patterns
of their sex chromosomes.

80
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:15,360
Males have XY sex chromosomes, and
females have XX sex chromosomes.

81
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,016
We see that X-linked
diseases are more common,

82
00:05:18,016 --> 00:05:20,687
because there are few
genes on the Y chromosome.

83
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:25,178
And so with that few number of genes,
there are not as many opportunities to

84
00:05:25,178 --> 00:05:28,898
have changes in the allelic
variation on those chromosomes.

85
00:05:28,898 --> 00:05:33,739
Thus, because of this,
because X-linked diseases are more common,

86
00:05:33,739 --> 00:05:39,340
we see that sex-linked disorders are more
common in males, because they are XY.

87
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:43,140
In that case, we see that diseases
such as color blindness and

88
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:46,920
hemophilia are more common in
men than they are in women.

89
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:51,560
Another sex-linked disorder is
Duchenne's muscular dystrophy.

90
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:56,190
For many of our major chronic diseases,
such as diabetes, asthma, and

91
00:05:56,190 --> 00:06:00,570
cardiovascular disease, we see that
family history of the given disease

92
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:04,830
increases an individual's
likelihood of the disease.

93
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:07,600
However, these diseases are not
what we would characterize

94
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,480
as single gene disorders.

95
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:13,853
You don't inherit one specific gene for
cardiovascular disease or diabetes.

96
00:06:13,853 --> 00:06:18,672
In fact, most of these diseases with
genetic underpinnings are not single

97
00:06:18,672 --> 00:06:19,826
gene disorders.

98
00:06:19,826 --> 00:06:24,333
But instead include contributions from
a complex set of genetic factors,

99
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:27,980
combined with factors in the environment.

100
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:32,250
For these diseases, we can use
epidemiologic methods to estimate

101
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:38,260
heritability, and to quantify the impact
of a shared environment on outcomes.

102
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:42,320
These complex diseases
are considered multifactorial,

103
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,500
meaning that they are due to
the effect of several genes.

104
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,432
And so novel quantitative methods
can be used to help estimate

105
00:06:49,432 --> 00:06:54,438
an individual's genetic burden,
as it is associated with health outcomes.

106
00:06:54,438 --> 00:06:59,285
Some health conditions have genetic
causes, but are not due to the inheritance

107
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:02,920
patterns of alleles from
a parent who carries that allele.

108
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,846
Sometimes the gametes,
as they are being formed,

109
00:07:05,846 --> 00:07:08,985
have errors that occur in
the course of cell division.

110
00:07:08,985 --> 00:07:12,782
And this results in the presence
of an extra chromosome or

111
00:07:12,782 --> 00:07:14,371
a loss of a chromosome.

112
00:07:14,371 --> 00:07:17,955
Generally, loss of
an autosomal chromosome,

113
00:07:17,955 --> 00:07:22,622
meaning a non-sex chromosome,
is incompatible with life.

114
00:07:22,622 --> 00:07:24,936
And so we see very few, if any,

115
00:07:24,936 --> 00:07:29,746
autosomal conditions due to a loss
of an autosomal chromosome.

116
00:07:29,746 --> 00:07:34,450
However, partial or complete loss
of a sex chromosome can result in

117
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:37,183
a condition known as Turner syndrome.

118
00:07:37,183 --> 00:07:41,590
Further, the additional chromosomes,
including both autosomal and

119
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:43,726
sex chromosomes, are possible.

120
00:07:43,726 --> 00:07:44,704
For example,

121
00:07:44,704 --> 00:07:50,499
the syndrome known as Down syndrome is due
to have in a third copy of chromosome 21.

122
00:07:50,499 --> 00:07:53,450
This is why it's called Trisomy 21.

123
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:58,379
And Klinefelter syndrome is a condition
caused by having an extra X

124
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:00,146
chromosome among men.

125
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:06,910
With knowledge of genetics, we can impact
our public health response in many ways.

126
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:10,840
We can modify our screening and
medical recommendations.

127
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,170
We can work to modify exposures
to environmental factors, and

128
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:19,990
we can initiate interventions to
groups with high genetic risk.

129
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:23,620
All of these strategies allow
us to provide medical care and

130
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:28,260
a more personalized public health
response to an individual.

131
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:32,591
Individuals are interested in how their
genetics can impact their disease risk.

132
00:08:32,591 --> 00:08:36,852
And so an increase in consumer-level
genetic testing is important for

133
00:08:36,852 --> 00:08:40,481
public health practitioners
to recognize and understand.

134
00:08:40,481 --> 00:08:45,222
As we work to communicate with the public
about the role of genetics in their

135
00:08:45,222 --> 00:08:46,587
individual health.

136
00:08:46,587 --> 00:08:50,412
In this module,
we reviewed the basic biology of

137
00:08:50,412 --> 00:08:56,120
genetics to learn how our DNA
can impact our health outcomes.

138
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,790
We reviewed the inheritance
patterns of single gene disorders.

139
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:04,495
And understand that not all diseases
that have increased risk associated with

140
00:09:04,495 --> 00:09:07,569
family history are due to
single genetic changes.

141
00:09:07,569 --> 00:09:10,289
Understanding the role that genetics

142
00:09:10,289 --> 00:09:14,630
plays in diseases of public
health importance is critical.

143
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:18,761
As we effectively learn about
the mechanisms of disease, and

144
00:09:18,761 --> 00:09:22,862
plan for effective screening and
intervention programs.
