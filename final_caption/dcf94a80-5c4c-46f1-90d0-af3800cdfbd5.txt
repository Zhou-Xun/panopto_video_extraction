1
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:15,540
Okay. Let's get started. I'm sure.

2
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:39,160
There's. Yeah.

3
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:51,760
Okay. So we're going to continue from last lecture, but the end of the last lecture was kind of confusing, so I just wanted to.

4
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:59,850
Explain in different ways. Sorry for the confusion in the last lecture.

5
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:05,700
Before going there is a couple of announcement.

6
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:11,910
There will be no lecture in Wednesday.

7
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:21,420
Okay. I'll be out of town. There will be no two office hours tomorrow either.

8
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,000
There will be an episode today.

9
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:39,060
I understand that you're going to probably need a lot of feedback from me before proposing the, you know, proposing the final project.

10
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:49,950
So what I am going to do is that I am going to schedule 15 minutes later that there were two words for each of you,

11
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:55,770
uh, during, uh, during this meeting.

12
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,490
So if requested, you don't have to meet me.

13
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,140
If you, if you have,

14
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:09,870
if you have already discussed with me where you can email me email or you can send a link of a current proposal as my feedback, that's fine.

15
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:17,300
So. But let's try to find the time that was worse for all of you.

16
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:26,540
So all the your project members and let's try to I think, you know, given that I will I'll be out of town.

17
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:36,460
It's a it's a hard to make the office our time and and probably not not a good idea to make you wait for such a long time just to talk about that.

18
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:41,959
So. So if you want to request a meeting, they send me, send me an email.

19
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:45,110
There's a constraint because I'll be I'll be in a meeting.

20
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:56,240
I will be a conference. So I probably don't have a lot of time during the regular, uh, you know, beginning hours.

21
00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:03,590
Okay. So, uh, so here's what I think I can do.

22
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:10,670
So I can usually. So if, when, when you try to schedule time, this is going to be June meeting.

23
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:18,350
And this is the unfortunately have to be early morning or late evening because because of my schedule.

24
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:22,280
Okay. So that that is a constraint.

25
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:28,610
So, uh, so I can give you the time, but the, my available time is going to be.

26
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:32,570
So I'll stay. So I'll be what? I'll be in a push peak time.

27
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:36,520
Which means that, you know. Uh.

28
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:42,569
So late in the evening will be very challenging, actually,

29
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:50,850
because if even if it's a so even if it's like 10 p.m. here, it's going to be like 7 p.m. there.

30
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:57,690
So all the morning would work the best because there will be I mean, it's going to be like five in the morning.

31
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:03,899
We might in the push peak time, but I can be I can be awake as long as you're awake.

32
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,380
So that's that's probably the best.

33
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,969
Or if you don't mind meeting really late evening, I can do it.

34
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:20,220
But you know even even at seven and eight during the conference time, it probably will be will be still outside.

35
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:26,580
Probably I can join by voice, but not not by not by face.

36
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:33,059
Face, yeah, not by face. So we, we just need to find the time, the words also for you.

37
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:36,900
But I'll try my best to keep, give my availability.

38
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:46,310
Okay. So that's, that's one thing I wanted to mention. So, and the other thing is that let me just make sure I.

39
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:52,820
Okay, I was I started to. So the other thing is that.

40
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:59,530
So remember for this proposal.

41
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:05,110
Okay, so this proposal, uh, can be changed.

42
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:09,670
Okay, so you're going to submit your Google doc.

43
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:14,330
Okay. You're going to share the document with.

44
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:18,100
With, with, with with with with me and GSI.

45
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,820
Okay. And so.

46
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:30,969
And we're going to I mean, you don't. So what I'm saying is that you have to summit summit first.

47
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:40,870
And you think it's a best until Friday, but it's okay if you if you want it to change a little bit later.

48
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:46,930
Okay. So or it's very likely that you will have to change the plan.

49
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:51,460
Okay. So maybe the proposal is just submit a proposal.

50
00:05:52,030 --> 00:06:04,300
I doubt that it's going to make a lot of difference between the grading, because the proposal is the the main proposal proposal is that can you study?

51
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:08,579
Okay. So pick your topic. Okay. So that that's all the about.

52
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:12,280
So it's not really just there's a rubric that, you know,

53
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:19,240
that that that gives about the some some grading about the proposal about your proposal that is going to going to be,

54
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:24,490
you know, most likely will be graded generously.

55
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:31,900
Okay. So but most important thing is to submit something that makes sense.

56
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:36,219
And we're not the proposal is not the time.

57
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:41,170
We actually evaluate and say, oh, this is totally acceptable.

58
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,399
You're going to get, you know, words is a don't don't be afraid like that.

59
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:56,410
So what the the reason why we are giving a proposal we're giving give you as asking you to submit your proposal is to start the conversation.

60
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:02,200
Okay. So if you think about you, your proposal looks great, but it looks too ambitious.

61
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:06,140
You probably need to, you know, make it a little more realistic.

62
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:15,570
Sometimes we give that comment. Sometimes we give the comment that, oh, your proposal looks, looks are a little bit underwhelming.

63
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:21,640
This is you know, you can do this, but you may not get a full credit if you do do this way.

64
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:29,200
This is like less less challenging than, you know, just a single homework project or something.

65
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:34,870
So if you propose something that is ongoing, that that might be the feedback we're going to get.

66
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:39,040
But your property itself will be graded likely generously.

67
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:44,170
Okay. So that that's your expectation. So don't try to push it.

68
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:51,160
I mean, I probably should should have should have said a little bit later, because I want you to,

69
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:58,239
you know, push push the topic as much as you can so that you you have a good shape.

70
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:05,680
Because we we have only like a little month, so a month and a half for the project.

71
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,340
And you have you probably have a lot of other things you need to do.

72
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:19,820
So so that's that's what you should expect. So it's okay if you wanted to set up a meeting next week.

73
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:25,160
So that's what I did. Or after you submitted the proposal and you can modify your proposal.

74
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:34,620
Okay, that's totally fine. I mean, I don't want you to submit an empty proposal or just three lines of proposal and expect to get a generous grading.

75
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:39,440
That's that's not what I meant. Right. But you need to you need to send me some content.

76
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:46,580
And if you are unsure that if this is really fit or not, you should you should try to communicate the instructor.

77
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:50,810
But, yeah, that that's all I can say. Okay.

78
00:08:50,940 --> 00:09:00,020
So to to make two main thing is that, you know, don't, don't, don't be worried about the grading, about the property.

79
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:10,700
Too much. And you can modify. And the more important thing is that you should, uh, you should try to set up a meeting with me.

80
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,960
Uh, you know, even though I'll be out of town this week.

81
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:18,740
Okay. If you. If you think you really should. Okay.

82
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:21,830
And any question about the proposal. Final proposal.

83
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:33,319
Or homework or anything. So probably so far I'm going to be exploring this part again so that because it

84
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:38,970
was very confusing and I have a good idea to how to make it less confusing.

85
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:45,350
So let's let's try if this works, by the way, I didn't modify this as a ten, 20, 22.

86
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:48,620
So it is it is supposed to be 2022.

87
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:55,730
Okay. So this was the example we we went through.

88
00:09:55,850 --> 00:10:00,020
So my suggestion is to go to the example.

89
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:04,040
First, I am going to explain what I what this example is meant to do.

90
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:09,920
And I'm going to go back to the slide to explain what this was about.

91
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:14,170
Okay. So.

92
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:22,900
So this is the simulation code. I'm going to just repeat this because the quote code is important here.

93
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:36,190
So we're simulating some two random variables that are two random variables that are to represent x axis and y axis in two dimension.

94
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:44,860
Okay, so empty is sum maximum bound of the y axis.

95
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:55,780
I'm going to simulate because I'm going to the my object here is that I'm going to sample from a beta distribution.

96
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:02,700
Okay. So when I sample from the beta distribution, what a this came distribution.

97
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:10,330
Well what it requires is I need to get a maximum value of this beta density.

98
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:18,520
So maximum value of a beta density happens when X is this value.

99
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:22,839
So you can analytically show it. So this is the maximum value.

100
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:31,000
If you have this, then none of your density will have a bigger value than this.

101
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:40,050
Okay. Then what I'm going to do is I'm going to sample two independent random variables.

102
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,650
One is a U in two dimension of U.

103
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:49,380
U is a correspond to this the y axis and the y.

104
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:58,680
I know it's a confusion to y is a correspond to the x axis in the two dimensional view and a y ranges from 0 to 1.

105
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:02,690
You ranges from zero to this maximum value. Okay.

106
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:08,420
And so so far you n y are independent.

107
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:15,350
Right. So that's true. But there's something we're going to do to connect the un y.

108
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,870
What I'm going to do is I'm going to find the indices.

109
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:25,219
So I'm going to own this subset of subset.

110
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:38,540
You are so to to the subset where the u value is the tens, the less than this beta density, which is my target function.

111
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:46,010
Okay. So I want to sample from some probably density function, which is the beta density.

112
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:51,500
And the beta density happens to be available so you don't have to make a function of it.

113
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:55,670
So I'm going to subset of it, some subset them.

114
00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:05,840
And I'm going to make when I return it, I'm going to make a subset of it.

115
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:14,930
X my x is a subset of Y that satisfy this condition.

116
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:22,770
So x so all the X's have are coming from the U.

117
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:33,290
Okay. So I know it's a confusing because we when we select the in the indices, we select the indices based on U.

118
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:42,920
Right. But when I say we're not actually using U on indices on the U, we are using this index on Y.

119
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,820
So this is confusing part, but that's what we do.

120
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:50,370
Okay. So if you do this. Okay.

121
00:13:51,620 --> 00:14:02,120
Then this. This is awesome. This is a subset of x, so y and you are independent, but x and you are not independent.

122
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:10,480
That doesn't make sense. So because of we only selected a subset of X based on the value of you.

123
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:19,270
Okay. And the value of you is a dependent on the value of y.

124
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:22,750
Okay. So the way how we selected.

125
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:27,340
So this, this is an algorithm. So it is I know this is cryptic, but let's start with this.

126
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:33,700
Okay. What does this do? Okay. And I'm calculating some some additional thing.

127
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:39,579
So R is the ratio of the well are the proportion of the those simple.

128
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:43,120
So length of indices, the length of index.

129
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:47,080
Meaning means that the size of X right.

130
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:56,200
And is the size of y. So what is the ratio between the size of X, which is a subset of Y and the size of y?

131
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:01,420
Okay. That that's that's what is what is. So we are returning this.

132
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:08,290
And what we are doing here is that I'm going to make a 2000 random sample.

133
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:13,780
I'm going to sample from beta distribution where a equal three and be equal to.

134
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:18,610
So it looks like a little bit tilted in the left, but looks looks pretty balanced.

135
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:27,550
And I'm gonna run I'm going to run this function and store the result in this variable among the result variable.

136
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,870
What I'm going to output is the R value.

137
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:35,230
So how, what is the size of x and Y?

138
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:41,840
So right side of you know, side of x, divide by side of Y and a what?

139
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:50,440
How many out of 2000 samples? How many samples survived past this this upsetting procedure?

140
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:59,200
So if you if you do if you look at this number R is of 0.54 or the 0.55.

141
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:07,960
So 55% of them are accepted. So accepted means means that satisfy this criteria.

142
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:16,660
Okay. And the the the even though we we sample 2000 random variables,

143
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:27,340
the size of X is only thousand 99 because in that all Y was selected, x is a subset of Y based on that criteria.

144
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:39,430
Okay. So and we're going to visualize what happened between the U and Y and X and this is what it is.

145
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:43,480
Okay. So what it does is that we are plotting.

146
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:53,800
Okay. Y and you hear. Y and you as a blue and this y index and you index.

147
00:16:54,190 --> 00:17:05,800
Okay. So the by the way, this or that, if you do, you if you haven't used it, if you attach, if you use or touch it, then you can use this list.

148
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:11,140
Okay. This is a list that you can use that use the list as if it's a variable.

149
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:19,570
So once you attach it, then you don't have to have to say a R on the score are s dollar sign, y or dollar sign.

150
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:27,820
So it's a it's a convenient function. You don't have to repeat the same variable name if you didn't know how to use it.

151
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:38,110
So yeah. So going back. So I'm plotting all y in new in blue color in the y index and you index.

152
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:42,309
These are these are the one that there is some setting, right.

153
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:45,700
So that the satisfied is the mysterious condition.

154
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:54,760
Okay. I'm going to plot them in red. Also, I'm going to plot the beta density function as a red lines.

155
00:17:55,060 --> 00:18:00,610
Okay. And that's that's what it looks like here.

156
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:07,740
Okay. So if you visualize, I hope that this is a little more clear.

157
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:21,090
Okay. So here is that this is a u, y axis U and x axis y and z axis is right.

158
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:24,899
So this is beta eight three.

159
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:28,170
Beta two. Okay. Sorry, this is tilted. Right. Okay.

160
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:34,050
So. Anyway. So. So these are.

161
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,600
So these are the blue dots are randomly sampled.

162
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,010
The value has nothing to do with distribution. Okay.

163
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:52,310
So so this blue that doesn't have any really any any relationship between these beta distribution and whatsoever.

164
00:18:52,520 --> 00:19:04,129
Okay. So, so obviously if you look at the distribution of blue in the x axis, it's a uniformly distributed y axis.

165
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:07,370
It's also uniformly distributed your you can all agree.

166
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:14,070
But look at the red dots.

167
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:24,780
What I did in the red dot is very simple. I just selected some value subset of value based on this y axis.

168
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:28,300
This is a you. Okay, so this is a vertical axis.

169
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,470
I selected the value here.

170
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:36,540
Okay. But what did I do here? What what is the effect of doing this?

171
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:44,910
That effect is actually change the distribution of the value in the horizontal axis.

172
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:52,050
Because now you have a lot more sample that I sampled around this region then to sample.

173
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:56,969
So the random sample that a sample of this region,

174
00:19:56,970 --> 00:20:07,440
because it's a less likely to pass the criteria here because the criteria is actually that what I did

175
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:14,260
is that we're restricting the value of you depending on the whether this crosses the line or not.

176
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:18,210
So we're only selecting the random variable below this line.

177
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:27,720
So now the distribution of the selected value, now x is a red value, basically selected on an x is.

178
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:42,940
Is not uniform anymore. Right. So and this density density probably with density of X is proportional to this function.

179
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:50,110
It's very obvious. Right. So look look at the value in the x axis.

180
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:56,770
Okay. Then those value collection of values, which is now thousand 99 points.

181
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:04,540
Okay. So most of them are you know, a majority of them are located here and very few of them are located here.

182
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:09,190
Right. So the the probability.

183
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:15,340
So even assuming that we sample the infinite number of uniform values,

184
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:23,020
those are probably the spatial distribution of this random number should be exactly proportional

185
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:30,850
to the to to this function we want to sample from in this case is a beta distribution.

186
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:37,380
Okay. Is it is it is it clear so far?

187
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:54,160
So. So that's so that's the effect of selecting the threshold threshold to making or so making a subset of those.

188
00:21:56,290 --> 00:22:05,860
So making a subset of so what we are doing is a making subset of these a horizontal axis based on the value in the vertical axis.

189
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:11,140
Okay. And and then you can change the distribution in the quality of the axis by,

190
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:17,800
by making a specific, uh, applying a specific function to threshold those values.

191
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:25,030
Okay. So that's, that's all what this equation is trying to say.

192
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,560
Okay. So. So.

193
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:33,450
So. So now I'm going backward now. Okay.

194
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:47,590
So what this what this equation is trying to say is that, oh, let's say let's make two independent random variables here, but.

195
00:22:47,890 --> 00:23:00,410
Okay. But let's say, uh, taking, if we, if we decide that we take a pairs, only if u is less than f of y, okay?

196
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:09,400
Then the basically the probability probability that you're y.

197
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:16,270
So, so we, we made, we made this sub setting once you subset it.

198
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:22,599
But once you apply this condition, the probability of y is less than x.

199
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:32,020
So this is a basically CDF of y, but this is a conditional distribution of Y, conditional on the condition that you value.

200
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:41,620
So this value is actually X because if we set x equal Y only if you is less than half of y.

201
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:52,780
So random variable x you know, is a function of both the and y and you get and that that is no longer uniformly distributed.

202
00:23:53,380 --> 00:24:03,760
And the distribution of this X should be proportional to the CDF PDA force in this case is the CDF,

203
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:11,590
but PDF it should be also proportional to the F of x and the CDF is a proportional to the CDF of this f of x.

204
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:18,880
So that's that's what that's what this procedure is trying to explain.

205
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:34,040
Okay. So and this part is is is just basically basically the same thing, but without, without this,

206
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:41,070
uh, you know, without, without this to simulate, explain the simulation procedure, basically.

207
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:52,260
So basically assimilating x, assimilating the random variable F of X is equivalent to simulating two independent random variable,

208
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:56,280
but connecting those two variables using these criteria.

209
00:24:56,430 --> 00:25:01,710
Okay. So ideally, if there is a way to.

210
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:08,040
So in this case X and you is definitely not independent of each other because of you and X are connected.

211
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:18,780
So. So the procedure we just did here is simulating two independent random variables and thresholding them.

212
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:24,810
But you don't have to write if you have a way that generate a two random variable,

213
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:36,540
but the so that you generate the random variable you based on these exact intervals.

214
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:44,520
So if you if you can jointly simulate the two independent uniform random variable,

215
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:51,660
but there are two uniform variable that are dependent on each other in this way, then, then you're good.

216
00:25:51,690 --> 00:26:00,290
So if, if you have a way, then x should be proportional to the density of x.

217
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:09,990
But because of that, it's hard. What we are doing is that we're going to simulate two independent random variable and going to subset it

218
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:19,080
so that we have basically same impact like this simulation but don't have to do directly simulating this.

219
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:23,790
Would it be hard? So that's what we are doing as a approximation.

220
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:29,160
Okay. Any questions?

221
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:38,810
Yeah. Looks like, you know, I some some may have a further questions but I, you know,

222
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:47,780
I thought explaining this way is a little bit easier to understand in a a then the other way around.

223
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:50,209
And a, you know, I'm a visual person.

224
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:58,670
So when I look at these, I understand what what is really meant then looking at the actual equation, that's more confusing.

225
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:03,710
Okay. So, so let's keep going.

226
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:09,770
So let's try to compare this with the now.

227
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:26,370
Let's say a equal turn in the B equals, uh, the 1.5 in this case, because A is a, B is a very big it's a tilted into the right really strongly.

228
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:30,720
So maybe let's show the figure first.

229
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:37,510
Fear looks like this. So a equal ten. So it's very likely to be Xs.

230
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:43,020
Xs upgraded Xs X is close to one and a big or 1.5.

231
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:50,880
And this is the beta distribution. So now there are a couple of differences from the previous one.

232
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:57,149
In the previous one is more that is it is more flat. And you know that this is a probably it's probably distribution.

233
00:27:57,150 --> 00:28:01,020
So it should sum up to one.

234
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:04,460
So maximum value is less than two here. Right.

235
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:09,150
So you need to sit you need to sample relatively small numbers.

236
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:14,850
But in this case, the maximum value goes up because the integration has to be one.

237
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:21,870
So there's got to be somewhere that that's higher. So that that's the difference.

238
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:34,560
The maximum is greater than five. And, you know, so what they think there is compared to here, there is a less red point here.

239
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:44,219
Okay. Because you we have a two dimensional space and we only take the value that is below this curve.

240
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:53,010
But this curve only occupies a smaller, small fraction of these two dimensional space.

241
00:28:53,680 --> 00:29:08,520
Okay. So and if you look at this value, so these are value basically represent uh, yeah.

242
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:19,560
Represent how many, what is a proportion of the y value that are accepted to be to become a part of X and A, this is 18.5%.

243
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:27,900
Okay. And this one number of X accepted random sample is only 370.

244
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:35,370
It's much smaller than what we simulated 2000 random variables, but out of them only 370 survived.

245
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,319
So, you know, it's not it's not too bad,

246
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:50,640
but this is definitely not very efficient way to get a random variable because you're wasting a lot of random variables here to to receive.

247
00:29:52,030 --> 00:30:01,210
Uh, to, to, to just obtain some, uh, some small fraction, random variable to be used for your simulation.

248
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:09,640
Okay. So so let's look at this part a little bit more.

249
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:15,440
Okay. So now. So there is a problem with this.

250
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:25,630
This this function better function x air means accept or reject Monte Carlo methods are that are better.

251
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:30,920
We're saying that the word simulating from the beta distribution and we are making of edge.

252
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:40,250
Okay so the problem is that actually I don't want to be in a situation that I don't know how many read them.

253
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:46,940
I'm simply okay, I want to if I sample 2000, write them better, but I want to get to tunneling them better.

254
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:52,690
I don't you know, sometimes I get thousand 99, sometimes I get 370.

255
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:56,089
And that number is not predictable.

256
00:30:56,090 --> 00:31:03,409
That's not a good thing. Okay, so this function are that arbitrary that we one is basically is guaranteeing

257
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:09,860
you that you get exactly 2000 random sample if you request 2000 to do that.

258
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:20,350
What, how, how you do it. Well you can you can do you can repeat this procedure which means that I'm going to send x x is no.

259
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:31,250
Okay. And. But I'm going to repeat this procedure until my sample becomes greater than mine.

260
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:38,570
Okay. So you what is doing is that I the run the previous function.

261
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:43,999
Okay. And concatenate those. What I all need is X at the end.

262
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,640
Right. So all the other Y and index is a useful to understand what these works.

263
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:58,400
But eventually what I want is the random the random sample that are distributed in the beta according to the beta distribution.

264
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:08,809
So if I wanted to have a random random sample from the beta distribution, then you just take the x values.

265
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:13,580
So I concatenate them and return them as a.

266
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:19,340
So concatenate them until the size becomes greater than M.

267
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:23,900
And even though I have a more than M random sample,

268
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:29,969
because I don't want you to say that I'm going to determine exactly and values I'm going to take care of all

269
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:37,430
out the all the extra values and take only the first to the empty value so that that should be still random.

270
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:42,840
So we're good. Okay. You might ask that.

271
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:45,870
Oh, so this is really just a rant.

272
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:51,040
This is really just a sampling from the beta distribution.

273
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:56,770
Some of you might ask, why do you not use our beta function here?

274
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,610
Well, we're trying to mimic our beta function. Okay.

275
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:06,610
So here we're pretending, then we don't have our data.

276
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:11,560
Okay. So that we're trying to mimic. What are we to do?

277
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:15,520
And so. Well, if you know.

278
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:21,730
So for the beta distribution, you have a function given, key function given.

279
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:28,870
So you can't just use the kids to sample from the from beta distribution.

280
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:34,960
But we're just using this beta as an example in the world that we're currently pretending that we don't know.

281
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:44,620
You know, the inverse CDF and we don't know how to, how to sample, you know, from this, this function.

282
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:52,149
But in practice, you know, is if this beta function is replaced to more complicated function,

283
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:58,090
it's hard to track like a mixtures of no matter where there's a lot of distribution, you actually don't know how it looks like.

284
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:03,790
So then you can still simulate the random variable according to this distribution.

285
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:07,120
So that's the intention of this particular part.

286
00:34:08,890 --> 00:34:16,130
Okay. So, so now we end is still 2000, if you remember.

287
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:19,210
So if you if you do this.

288
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:26,370
Where does the count go? Oh, and one thing.

289
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:31,530
One thing I just wanted to let you know is that you probably have not paid attention,

290
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:37,860
but I made a random, uh, I made a global variable here, so count.

291
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:41,100
So this function actually keeps track of this count.

292
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:47,370
Okay. So when this function was called, it was counting, which is because it's a global variable.

293
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:53,800
So then what he does is now far.

294
00:34:56,340 --> 00:35:06,060
So if I do, this end was 2000. So now when I look at the outcome of this, you know, a, ah, bittersweet one.

295
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:11,400
It does return 2000. Random variable and count is that.

296
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:15,180
But I had to call this function six times.

297
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:21,680
Because this is quite skewed like a ten, ten and 1.5.

298
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:25,210
This is this this occupies this much area.

299
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:32,420
So, you know, one, one random sample that even if we tried is a 370 random variable.

300
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:38,959
So, you know, you just need to need to repeat until the total size becomes total over 2000.

301
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:43,140
So that's what it takes. So you have to use a these are quite,

302
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:52,450
quite a lot what if a 50 and be equal to this is extremely skewed right so you know

303
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:59,690
you can you could try if you if you wanted to see what it looks like 50 and two BC.

304
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:07,850
So let's, let's look at what it looks like. So this looks really, really skewed in this case.

305
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:21,830
What? What does it take? So now, you know, to attempt to sample 2000, I, I have to do this 2000 random sampling 19 times.

306
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:31,020
Okay. So that's then that works, but that's pretty slow, I guess you can imagine even more extreme case.

307
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:45,530
Right. So even though these are the accept or reject sampling procedure works, this has problem basically in terms of efficiency.

308
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:51,380
Okay. That's that's what this part is trying to get it in a question so far.

309
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:57,960
Okay. So now.

310
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:06,630
So what? What? So if you think about this example here.

311
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:11,240
Okay. Where does the problem. Why do you think it's inefficient?

312
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:15,670
Why do you have a lot of waste of space? Waste of the random variables here.

313
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:23,170
How can you improve? Maybe.

314
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:31,580
Maybe. Let me ask this question. Do you see, like really bad cases even worse than this?

315
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:40,670
I mean, not beyond the beta distribution. Okay. The in a very worst situation.

316
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:48,370
If it if this is like spiking celeb kind of this we should spike the spike distribution really.

317
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:58,370
It'll be really, really inefficient. Right. And you cannot predict what kind of function you will get if you wanted to make a random,

318
00:37:58,370 --> 00:38:03,010
simpler that are supposed to be generalized so that that is a problem.

319
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:07,880
So your because we're always sampling this rectangular space.

320
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:16,069
Okay. If the function, you know, occupies the area below,

321
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:21,420
the function occupies only a small fraction of the selected rectangular space, you're going to have a problem.

322
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:31,470
Right. So. So what if we don't have to use rectangular space?

323
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:36,290
Okay, so that. That is. Oh, sorry.

324
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:40,559
That is the one thing. Okay. And I before.

325
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:44,370
Before we were going. Before going. Going there. Yeah, the other thing.

326
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,090
Okay. So, uh, the other thing is that.

327
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:55,950
So currently beta distribution is conveniently, uh, ranges from 0 to 1.

328
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:04,679
Right. But what if it's not 0 to 1? If it what if it's a 0 to 10 or one to 1 to 5 or something like that?

329
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:09,870
That's another thing we need to figure out. Okay, so let's let's figure that out first.

330
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:13,190
Okay. So, uh.

331
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:24,300
So for example, if we have us that simulate the random variable now instead of 0 to 1,

332
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:30,360
let's say X is A to B, so then you still have a rectangular space.

333
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:36,090
Everything is the same, but you have to re normalize the value differently.

334
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:40,230
That's that's the only thing that is different.

335
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:44,700
So in this case, you simulate the life instead of 0 to 1.

336
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:50,880
Now you simulate the Y from A to B and simulate the you from the zero to maximum value.

337
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:56,040
And take the take the you from here. So this this will be pretty much the same.

338
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:58,050
Okay. The distribution of.

339
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:10,270
The distribution of uranium samples should still correspond to the it should be proportional to the to the density you are intending to sample.

340
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:15,910
Okay. But the problem is that what if A and B is really, really large?

341
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:19,640
For example. I want to separate from this visions.

342
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:28,240
Okay. I don't know, you know, you know how to separate from normal distribution, but you have a computer that doesn't have any idea for something.

343
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:32,050
You have to sample from normal distribution. Okay. Now what?

344
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:37,130
How. How do you do it? Well. How would you do it?

345
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:40,680
Because normal distribution doesn't have a range. Okay. Okay.

346
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:47,250
So how how do I deal with the more generic version of target density?

347
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:52,080
That is a question. So.

348
00:40:55,430 --> 00:41:00,360
So. Well. Well, what about.

349
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:04,780
What about this? Okay, so. We eat.

350
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:12,590
Let's not let's forget about the cell sampling from rectangular distribution.

351
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:22,850
Okay. So the original procedure is that if you have something like this, I need to make it more skewed.

352
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:34,060
Okay, so. If you have a description that looks really like spiky, spiky like this.

353
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:38,950
Okay, then in a normal distribution could look like this.

354
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:44,290
And well. Maybe.

355
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:48,730
If so, currently I need to sample from this rectangle.

356
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:53,379
But is it possible to sample from something else?

357
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:57,970
Like some distribution like base, for example? Okay then.

358
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:06,100
So why not? So now we're giving up the uniform sampling idea instead of uniformly sampling.

359
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:10,450
If I sample these political axes from.

360
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:13,750
From something, some special, we already know how to sample.

361
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:25,299
Good, but not a uniform distribution. Then it might be more efficient, because now your way, you still waste a lot of space.

362
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:29,840
But you know this part and this part is not wasted, for example.

363
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:38,889
Right. So that's the idea. So this idea is used in a lot of places, including important sampling or so on.

364
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:48,520
So it's important to understand what what this is doing. So the difference here is that instead of assuming the maximum is constant value,

365
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:56,410
now we're assuming that the maximum is about is dependent on your horizontal axis value.

366
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:02,770
Okay. So. So then.

367
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:13,720
So. So. So I mean, let's let's let's look at this first.

368
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:23,440
So basically the difference here is that instead of having constant m now you have empty of y.

369
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:28,030
That's the difference, right? So what what does it do?

370
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:32,980
So the difference difference is that you're sampling y you're not from the uniform distribution.

371
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:37,160
You're sampling from some distribution g you know, of.

372
00:43:37,390 --> 00:43:41,860
Okay. Could be normal distribution. Could be exponential distribution or whatever.

373
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:49,160
Okay. And now you're selecting criteria is that you are sampling.

374
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:59,870
Okay. So sampling you get not independently to wise then now you and y are correlated because you when you sample from you,

375
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:13,760
you need to you're still sampling from the uniform distribution, but sampling from the maximum value is a some are some some constant and kind of why.

376
00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:21,350
Okay. And, and the other procedure is still the same.

377
00:44:21,350 --> 00:44:27,200
So I'm going to accept this only if you is less than F of why so.

378
00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:34,880
Because. So in this case this is a wide and this is f a y f a wise approach to this moment.

379
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:49,670
So we still need to sample from this area below f f of y, but we're assuming that the end and time field y is always created in f of y.

380
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:57,620
Okay, so we are choosing m such that so that the intensity of y is always above this.

381
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:08,640
So this dysfunction then was your sample sample the quantity versus value from here.

382
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:18,260
Now the, the, the blue pullover blue dots are below this and your why.

383
00:45:18,530 --> 00:45:24,400
But the red dots, which is excepted will still be need to be below f a Y.

384
00:45:24,410 --> 00:45:35,210
So that's that's the idea. Okay. So only thing that was changed is this basically okay and this and this.

385
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:44,980
So if he of y was just a uniform distribution, it here y will be just constant and it will be exactly the same as before.

386
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:54,460
Okay. So how do we set select this maximum away.

387
00:45:54,490 --> 00:45:57,729
Here. Here it says Emma. Why? This is a Emma.

388
00:45:57,730 --> 00:46:02,200
Who? Why is basically my time free of why. Okay, so that that's the connection.

389
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:13,450
Okay. So if we, if we set Emma y as a m times of g of why that's called envelope function, and we can sample from general distribution.

390
00:46:13,450 --> 00:46:18,590
That is not necessarily a. Uniform distribution.

391
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:25,700
Okay. Now. So this is a generic version of accept reject Darwinism.

392
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:38,600
So this organism is useful if you want it to sample from a arbitrary form the simpler distribution that is represented by arbitrary function f.

393
00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:42,409
Okay. But you can provide the envelope function.

394
00:46:42,410 --> 00:46:49,910
Envelope function can be you know, can can be something can be something else, but.

395
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:57,590
So something has like a uniform distribution, but envelope function can be just a general function.

396
00:46:57,650 --> 00:47:04,790
So what, what it what this algorithm is doing is that you're generating the Y from some distribution key.

397
00:47:05,150 --> 00:47:12,290
Okay. And you are sampling you from zero zero to in uniform distribution, 0 to 1.

398
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:18,470
Okay. And you're accepting it. If only for you is less than this value.

399
00:47:18,850 --> 00:47:21,970
Okay. Okay. So.

400
00:47:23,730 --> 00:47:27,840
So you're still sampling you from that from 0 to 1.

401
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:44,220
Okay. And you're accepting if you invest in Apple, why you buy that MGM, why this is equivalent to your sampling you from zero two and it's like, oh.

402
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:56,110
Generative energy. A y. Okay. And, um, selecting this.

403
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:59,960
So these are. These are equivalent, right? You agree with that? Okay.

404
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:04,520
So this is basically same as a previous slide, but slightly different flavor.

405
00:48:05,570 --> 00:48:11,930
So now you don't have to in the previous scheme, the problem is that sampling from empty.

406
00:48:12,290 --> 00:48:18,980
So this particular range from uniform distribution with some function of Y is a complicated.

407
00:48:19,010 --> 00:48:22,010
Now you don't have to do it you just the sample from 0 to 1.

408
00:48:22,610 --> 00:48:26,900
And instead of using different normalization function.

409
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:30,420
Okay. So.

410
00:48:34,310 --> 00:48:39,440
Yeah. So. So here here. The constraint here is that the of y.

411
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:45,260
So the the constant you need to make sure is that these always hold.

412
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:54,529
Okay. Because if mdo y cannot cross this with f of x, then then that's that's not going to work.

413
00:48:54,530 --> 00:49:01,190
So, and should be chosen as a value where you know, these, you know,

414
00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:07,820
you calculate this function in a should it be greater than the upper bound of this?

415
00:49:08,450 --> 00:49:13,330
Okay. We don't think it can equal.

416
00:49:13,930 --> 00:49:16,310
Just so you know. Okay.

417
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:24,090
So if M is closer to this bond, you are going to have a higher acceptance rate and you're going to be your own agent with to be more efficient.

418
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:33,000
Okay. So the proof is pretty, pretty straightforward.

419
00:49:33,010 --> 00:49:41,890
But you can you can prove this. Okay. So your target function, F of X may not be necessarily probability density.

420
00:49:41,910 --> 00:49:47,459
Sometimes you don't have a problem with density because you don't have the normalization normalizing constant.

421
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:53,500
So f so let's say pio pi of x is exactly the probabilities,

422
00:49:53,530 --> 00:49:59,090
the function and the f of x is a proportional to your to the proper probabilities to the function.

423
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:08,900
Then you can. You can just, you know, calculate the probability that this is an X.

424
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:19,010
So it's a probability that simply simple the X is a, the so simple the x is Y using using this way.

425
00:50:19,010 --> 00:50:21,710
So the probability that this is accepted basically.

426
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:34,040
So you simple y first in this in this in this procedure and the you becomes dependent on the Y and you accept this on only when this happens.

427
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:45,860
So this probability of it being accepted will be basically this normalization constant c d by by M So you can,

428
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:55,129
you can prove that, okay, here, if you if you just calculate what the problem is a given that I accepted this.

429
00:50:55,130 --> 00:51:00,680
So given that Y values and accepted this are you values are accepted have the

430
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:09,440
function of y what is the probability that what is the probability that this?

431
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:21,250
So it is this the simple the x value belongs to the intended intended area, whatever.

432
00:51:21,490 --> 00:51:28,630
So this area is an arbitrary area. So what is the probability that X is a subset of a specific area?

433
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:32,230
You can just use the definition of a conditional distribution.

434
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:40,930
And this this probability is a C divided by M and this probability is basically joint distribution between those two.

435
00:51:41,150 --> 00:51:50,230
Q Simple from G first, and this is the probability of being accepted and those C and can see an M cancels out, g cancels out.

436
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:58,480
So at the end you only have a pie here. And that's how you prove that this is actually sampling from the right distribution.

437
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:08,620
So then. Well, so now I get that you can't.

438
00:52:09,070 --> 00:52:17,470
So this is just generalization of previous arboretum, but of allowing, you know, different level of function that the uniform function.

439
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:20,500
I get it. Then how do we select a uniform?

440
00:52:20,830 --> 00:52:25,720
So how do we select the envelope function that there's a there's a next question.

441
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:34,180
So, for example, you might be asked to sit, you know, sample from something really like very complicated here.

442
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:45,790
Okay. So if you look at this, you have an idea that, oh, this function, you know, is has a two part.

443
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:52,180
This part is a, you know, exponentially decaying.

444
00:52:52,810 --> 00:53:00,219
It's a like a normal distribution center, a normal distribution. And this part, it has about bounded.

445
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:03,670
So this cannot be greater than five at most. Right.

446
00:53:04,210 --> 00:53:08,260
So then it's a in this case, a good way to sample.

447
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:11,950
This is a few simple. So your.

448
00:53:14,110 --> 00:53:23,139
Your function looks really complicated, but if you know that your function is bounded by certain, so some distant bound.

449
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:26,950
And if you know that this looks like this. Well, why don't I make it?

450
00:53:26,950 --> 00:53:32,250
Well, and then a function is an upper bound. Then this, you know.

451
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:39,940
Then if I use this to accept, reject, reject algorithm, then the wasted space is relatively small.

452
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:45,460
So in this case, this is very ideal and below function you might want to use.

453
00:53:47,970 --> 00:53:52,790
Okay. So let's look at the hindrance session. Okay.

454
00:53:56,320 --> 00:54:00,700
So. So we're doing exactly that.

455
00:54:01,210 --> 00:54:05,230
So this is actually a function we wanted to sample from.

456
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:09,470
And this is a value function. Okay.

457
00:54:11,930 --> 00:54:18,980
And in this case, we know that. So this this is not greater than five.

458
00:54:19,010 --> 00:54:26,780
Right. So we we can we can say that 0fty but so f is always.

459
00:54:27,270 --> 00:54:34,280
Okay. Less than five t. Right. So we can set them equal five here.

460
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:40,340
Now, conveniently, this G is a standard normal distribution.

461
00:54:40,590 --> 00:54:49,639
Okay. So what we can do is this follows the normal distribution, uh, well, proportional to standard normal distribution.

462
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:56,060
So when you sample from G, that's with the normalization constant, you basically sample from the normal distribution.

463
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:58,910
So sample from normal distribution.

464
00:54:59,330 --> 00:55:08,800
After that, you, I mean, in this particular implementation, it's not sampling from 0 to 1, it's sampling from zero to this maximum value.

465
00:55:08,810 --> 00:55:15,620
But it doesn't really matter if you want it to do exactly the same thing, you probably want that all.

466
00:55:16,850 --> 00:55:27,120
And so. N and you can say in the Africa, which u is the lesson for why divide by any type of way.

467
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:30,530
So this this is what, what it was supposed to be, I think.

468
00:55:30,530 --> 00:55:33,740
But what both of them will do the exact same thing. You can.

469
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:46,100
You can check it. Yeah. So. And once you have this, you can try to show how this works, okay?

470
00:55:46,890 --> 00:55:54,480
In the same same way. So, uh, so here you have this insight.

471
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:57,910
So this is the normal distribution, and this is assembled.

472
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:02,280
So this is a function of the function F that is hard to track.

473
00:56:02,290 --> 00:56:07,229
You don't know what the CDF looks like. But still, you can actually sample from this distribution.

474
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:11,130
Exactly. Okay. If you go to when we're finding the.

475
00:56:11,870 --> 00:56:16,950
It would be worth abiding by the campaign.

476
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:21,170
Q Why? This one? Mm hmm.

477
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:28,710
How common is it in practice to worry about it? Because in many rural areas, because of the size of your own household.

478
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:36,500
Yeah, very good question. So if you if you expect so this is a usually G of why is.

479
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:48,349
So. PDF. Right. So if you're if you're thinking about the continuous distribution, you usually don't hit exactly zero.

480
00:56:48,350 --> 00:57:01,360
Right? But you can hit the numerical zero. So you're right that you actually may need to worry about those cases, especially like, uh.

481
00:57:02,790 --> 00:57:08,040
The if the rate range of range of those values can vary a lot.

482
00:57:08,370 --> 00:57:17,610
So in practice, it's better to work with these low fat, low, low, low, low density than F so you can change this as a low density.

483
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:25,500
So there are ways to avoid that and that that's a different numerical technique we're not going to cover here.

484
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:29,800
But you can combine those techniques to avoid those those cases.

485
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:34,170
So it's application specific, and this is very vulnerable to that.

486
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:42,720
On the flow issue, if we think about sampling from normal distribution with the like score 550 or something, so we're going to get to there.

487
00:57:43,590 --> 00:57:49,300
Okay. Good question. Okay. Okay.

488
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:53,050
So final example. Okay. So.

489
00:57:55,550 --> 00:58:00,500
So what I want to do so this is I think is the practical problem we have.

490
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:04,640
Okay, so truncated of year distribution.

491
00:58:05,810 --> 00:58:18,170
So oftentimes I just had are doing a lot of statistical tests and you know, only focus on the significant stuff, right.

492
00:58:18,710 --> 00:58:26,330
That means that, you know, you're generating a lot of a lot of value.

493
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:31,940
But we only focuses on focus on very, very the tail.

494
00:58:33,290 --> 00:58:36,930
So. So I.

495
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:45,930
What I want to do is that I want to. So. So this is a situation I need a bunch of billion to test or, you know, billion.

496
00:58:45,930 --> 00:58:52,200
Billion. Just a statistical test. Then I got to know this this $2 billion distribution, I.

497
00:58:53,910 --> 00:59:03,750
And, you know, I want to look at the one that has a p value less than like ten to my ten to the negative eight or some very, very significant ones.

498
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:11,790
Okay. So then you need to you may need to have a way to sample from that truncated normal distribution.

499
00:59:11,790 --> 00:59:22,080
So what you want to do is I want to sample from normal distribution, but only when you know my score is grade in a certain threshold.

500
00:59:22,290 --> 00:59:28,960
Okay. So. So then how do you do it?

501
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:33,540
So this is what you want to sample from? Okay.

502
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:43,360
So the choice is basically, well, you cannot use really uniform distribution, but you could.

503
00:59:43,750 --> 00:59:48,520
The problem with the uniform distribution is that if you choose the uniform distribution,

504
00:59:49,510 --> 00:59:53,230
then you're centrally from rectangular space and there is no end.

505
00:59:53,670 --> 00:59:59,200
Okay, so you need to make an assumption that, you know, you just need to, you know, make a hand-waving assumption.

506
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:03,609
Oh, I'm going to assume that the maximum value doesn't doesn't go over like 50 or something.

507
01:00:03,610 --> 01:00:10,630
So you need to sacrifice that or you can use this envelope function.

508
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:14,860
And there is a many different way to choose the envelope function.

509
01:00:15,940 --> 01:00:20,020
One envelope function you may want to choose is normal distribution.

510
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:30,459
Hey, this looks like this. So I can actually make exactly the same this same function and an equal one.

511
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:38,980
Right? There is no always like I won't I always already know what the I've already know how to sample from normal distribution.

512
01:00:38,980 --> 01:00:43,060
And this all looks good. Okay, so that's that's one way to do it.

513
01:00:45,070 --> 01:00:48,219
The other way is a truncated use, a truncated exponential, this vision.

514
01:00:48,220 --> 01:00:54,340
Oh, this, this is not this is definitely fast decaying, faster than exponential.

515
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:59,620
But I can assume that this is you know, this is exponential distribution.

516
01:00:59,620 --> 01:01:06,850
There are shifted. Okay. Because the exponent this distribution is just a it's a symmetric.

517
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:14,259
Okay, so I can use this. Well, you can also other try to use other envelope function.

518
01:01:14,260 --> 01:01:18,970
You're welcome to use that. And this is a fun problem if you wanted to find something better.

519
01:01:20,170 --> 01:01:27,000
Okay. So the two question here is it's both.

520
01:01:27,210 --> 01:01:34,980
Can both of them both function can serve as a symbol of and bill of function is one of them are not eligible.

521
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:46,450
In which case this is not eligible. You have.

522
01:01:47,670 --> 01:01:51,180
Right. So you have a key. Okay.

523
01:01:51,840 --> 01:02:00,540
You need to select. Oh, and where this is always that and values should be always greater than these value.

524
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:09,360
Right. So it. The end of the function becomes ineligible if there is a no maximum you can set here.

525
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:14,130
Okay. So. So if.

526
01:02:15,270 --> 01:02:24,740
So in this case, just to to to get to get to the question of in this case, the this is normal distribution.

527
01:02:24,750 --> 01:02:28,410
So E to the minus X squared, right.

528
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:37,920
And a g to the X is. If this is a normal distribution, obviously, this this also has this and this cancels out.

529
01:02:37,930 --> 01:02:49,570
So this is fine in the exponential distribution, you basically have something like this when I'm just ignoring the constant now.

530
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:55,660
So this minus X, basically this is minus x x times, you know, being over something, right?

531
01:02:56,080 --> 01:03:05,100
And there's some other constant. So if you do this because this is a decaying slower than this, this is okay, okay.

532
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:16,150
This has the maximum. But if this is the other way around, you cannot use normal distribution as an envelope function of exponential this.

533
01:03:16,330 --> 01:03:19,600
You cannot do that because of distribution decay too fast.

534
01:03:19,990 --> 01:03:28,000
Okay, so both of them, the short answer is that both of them are eligible as an invalid function.

535
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:38,500
This one could be subjective. Which one is better? Raise your hand if you think normal distribution is better.

536
01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:46,440
Okay. Raise your hand if you think exponentially. This speech is a better truncating speech.

537
01:03:46,510 --> 01:03:51,360
Okay. Why so? I thought normal is better.

538
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:54,840
Because normal distribution has an end of equal.

539
01:03:54,850 --> 01:03:58,990
Exactly one. Right. You know, exposure detection.

540
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:02,770
I don't know what that means, but the there's there's some evidence there.

541
01:04:02,780 --> 01:04:10,790
So you're going to lose some efficiency. Why why did you think that the explanation, especially the second one, is better?

542
01:04:11,450 --> 01:04:15,440
So can anyone answer why you chose that?

543
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:27,580
That is the answer. What's the problem with the first one? It seems like there would be a pretty high degree of protection.

544
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:35,430
Based on your example because we're all the same way. We need samples from the field or.

545
01:04:37,930 --> 01:04:41,880
But we don't ever want to hear that whole area.

546
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:50,890
Okay? We just want that. Very good. So when you when you use normal distribution, that means that you are using this whole description.

547
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:57,400
Okay. To use random. You use a use and then a function.

548
01:04:58,390 --> 01:05:02,830
But when you use exponential distribution, you are only focusing on this part.

549
01:05:03,430 --> 01:05:10,570
Okay. So you don't have a chance that you you are you're sampling any value that is even not eligible.

550
01:05:11,650 --> 01:05:16,420
Okay. So it is a normal distribution because this is not true.

551
01:05:16,660 --> 01:05:19,719
So we're trying to sample from truncate normal distribution.

552
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:27,400
But if we use the normal distribution, you basically don't get any don't gain anything because you have huge probability to sample from here.

553
01:05:28,210 --> 01:05:31,830
What is better? So let's say you are using normal distribution.

554
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:36,370
Then what envelope function? Do you think it's better than this just to send a normal.

555
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:49,590
There is another way to do it. This is a this is some threshold serious.

556
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:55,370
If you want to use it on this mission ship to me. Okay.

557
01:05:56,210 --> 01:06:06,230
And if you use this as as a symbol of function, you'll probably have a better chance of of sampling some value that that is eligible here.

558
01:06:07,820 --> 01:06:12,460
Does it make sense? So let's let's look at the examples.

559
01:06:12,510 --> 01:06:22,980
I think without looking at the example, it's hard, but let's not let's not get into there yet because we haven't solved the two example first.

560
01:06:23,220 --> 01:06:31,830
So first of all and then the normal well, then normal without shifting, it's very easy because you have just an equal one.

561
01:06:32,580 --> 01:06:46,470
Okay. But the problem is that we are simply from just thing that normal and you're accepting to F so but F of X is that all zero here.

562
01:06:46,980 --> 01:06:53,730
Right. And only only have a positive value here because it is a truncate normal.

563
01:06:54,420 --> 01:06:59,730
So you only sample from a really, really small area that is a problem.

564
01:07:00,030 --> 01:07:06,000
Okay, so the acceptance rate is really, really small.

565
01:07:06,390 --> 01:07:12,390
If C is C is very positive.

566
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:19,770
Well, sometimes this is not too bad in the case where actually let's say C was here.

567
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:26,040
Wow, I didn't know that. But that's then then you're going to accept this much.

568
01:07:26,370 --> 01:07:30,990
So not a problem, right? So if the sees negative, this is not a problem.

569
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:39,450
If these are very positive, especially very extreme positive, then your acceptance rate will be really, really bad.

570
01:07:39,780 --> 01:07:44,940
Okay. Okay. For truncate normal.

571
01:07:44,970 --> 01:07:54,390
How what? What do you need to do? So this is F of x and this is, you know, the envelope function.

572
01:07:54,630 --> 01:08:00,390
So you need to make sure that this is always greater than equal or greater than this envelope function.

573
01:08:01,050 --> 01:08:12,390
So what your if you divide each of each of the side with this value, basically the problem is reduced to finding the maximum of these value.

574
01:08:12,690 --> 01:08:20,460
Okay, so well this value can be maximized.

575
01:08:20,670 --> 01:08:21,930
So if so,

576
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:36,030
depending on the how the so what the relationship of lambda and C lambda is to the so lambda is the rate of the exponential exponential function,

577
01:08:36,030 --> 01:08:41,460
the coefficient of exponential distribution, and c is the threshold.

578
01:08:42,030 --> 01:08:48,030
So and this is a quadratic function, right? So we can, we can get to that.

579
01:08:48,030 --> 01:08:52,169
But basically because this is a truncated distribution.

580
01:08:52,170 --> 01:09:02,360
Well, if when, when a it's only defined the X is greater than C, you can analyze this exponent and you can say that, oh,

581
01:09:02,370 --> 01:09:14,190
if lambda is greater than C and then so usually if the C, C is if sees the negative, for example, this happens a lot, I guess.

582
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:22,319
So in that case, this is the so this is the maximum value, otherwise this is the maximum value.

583
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:28,170
So it's a little complicated. Okay, but this this this is what it is.

584
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:42,170
Okay. And the next thing you may want to know about is a how do we choose Lambda to maximize our SO?

585
01:09:42,170 --> 01:09:47,510
As long as M is greater than this value, this is fine.

586
01:09:48,170 --> 01:10:02,460
But. But especially when in in this kind of scenario, how do we make sure that this are this maximize acceptance rate?

587
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:09,830
So that problem is basically so m so m value is basically this value, right?

588
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:16,970
So if you make the end value smaller and smaller, that increases the acceptance rate.

589
01:10:17,180 --> 01:10:21,440
So this is basically we maximize we maximize this particular function.

590
01:10:22,010 --> 01:10:26,960
But you are again, minimizing this to optimize the acceptance rate.

591
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:31,280
Okay. So if you do some little algebra, I'll just leave as a hallmark.

592
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:35,630
But you're going to be able to find that you can because of you.

593
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:41,730
You can decide what kind of function you can use for the exponential function.

594
01:10:41,750 --> 01:10:45,380
We didn't decide what should be the rate of the exponential decay.

595
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:53,510
So if you decide that the exponential rate is this value, this will maximize the acceptance rate.

596
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:58,040
Okay. So that that was that there would only be a fun exercise.

597
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:04,190
Okay. So so you can you can do that at home.

598
01:11:04,190 --> 01:11:07,580
But basically that that's the equation we got. We got. Okay.

599
01:11:08,390 --> 01:11:15,560
So let's look at the example from the trunk to simulate normal distribution.

600
01:11:15,740 --> 01:11:18,830
So. So first one.

601
01:11:19,530 --> 01:11:24,830
Okay. What? What? So the first one is that we are using just normal distribution, this envelope function.

602
01:11:25,070 --> 01:11:28,760
Okay. And the lower here.

603
01:11:28,790 --> 01:11:32,570
This is a trunk. This is a C. So the threshold.

604
01:11:33,110 --> 01:11:42,650
So we are simply from normal distribution and we are accepting the value when Y is greater than grade in lower.

605
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:48,320
Why? Why is it so easy? Because this one is basically accepting it.

606
01:11:49,000 --> 01:12:06,670
And so F of X is. The normal normal density right times and C the greater than C equal or greater than C or and until X is a normal density.

607
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:14,889
So you are sampling from this case with this probability and this and this is canceled.

608
01:12:14,890 --> 01:12:19,930
So you're accepting it only if the U is, you know.

609
01:12:21,230 --> 01:12:25,760
So. So basically this can be either zero or one.

610
01:12:25,770 --> 01:12:28,970
So when when this is one, you always excepted. Right.

611
01:12:28,980 --> 01:12:32,150
So that's that's why this criteria is so simple.

612
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:42,590
Okay. And this is, uh, this is the, uh, so this returns the sample value here.

613
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:53,230
Okay. And the second function using the exponential distribution looks a little bit more complicated.

614
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:58,930
So this is a this is optimal, not gamma lambda.

615
01:12:59,050 --> 01:13:10,390
Okay. Optimal lambda. Okay. Uh, that that is just from this previous slide, as we saw, we have improved.

616
01:13:10,930 --> 01:13:14,830
You can. You can easily derive it. Okay, so we're just gonna leave it as one mark.

617
01:13:15,910 --> 01:13:20,020
I mean, it's not assignment. Okay? Just the. You can do it at home.

618
01:13:21,010 --> 01:13:25,840
And and this is a simple sampling from the exponential distribution.

619
01:13:27,220 --> 01:13:37,120
Okay. So this is we're using all XP to sample from exponential distribution and sample from the uniform normal distribution.

620
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:42,790
Okay. And so this part is a little bit interesting.

621
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:47,710
So this is correspond to what the robot asked before.

622
01:13:48,370 --> 01:13:53,170
So we actually want to just do this.

623
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:58,740
The why is less than F0.

624
01:13:58,780 --> 01:14:02,050
Why if I am here, why?

625
01:14:02,710 --> 01:14:05,230
But this value could be really, really small.

626
01:14:05,890 --> 01:14:19,960
So instead of doing this, you can you can take it as a log of you less than log of ask of you have a y minus log of of here y when I say,

627
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:26,940
okay, so you can play this low of Amazon. So, so that's that's what we are doing here.

628
01:14:26,950 --> 01:14:33,450
So we're, we're calculating the log of log ratio in a log here.

629
01:14:33,460 --> 01:14:37,010
So we're calculating the log of M of here.

630
01:14:37,180 --> 01:14:42,730
So because this is the maximum value you can calculate, that's the same same value.

631
01:14:42,790 --> 01:14:55,030
This is a, this is m value here. And uh, the log ratio is basically calculating the low log of F divide by G.

632
01:14:55,090 --> 01:15:02,680
So that's what, that's what this is calculating. So log ratio is returning this particular value.

633
01:15:03,310 --> 01:15:11,890
And this particular value is actually the the rate, the this is calculating this this value, this reason itself.

634
01:15:12,130 --> 01:15:19,870
Okay. So it so it looks a little complicated, but it's all just coming from the same slide.

635
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:28,660
And using just log transformation here to make sure that this doesn't doesn't run into the numerical Christian problem.

636
01:15:29,770 --> 01:15:43,650
Okay. So and this is a function that just to show the density of the sample, the values we know, we don't we no longer has these blue and red dots.

637
01:15:43,660 --> 01:15:49,750
So we're going to just show that how this works. Well, based based on the how this density function looks like.

638
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:54,400
Okay. Then let's look at how it looks like.

639
01:15:55,960 --> 01:16:03,880
So what this what this has done is that we're sampling 100,000 points.

640
01:16:04,090 --> 01:16:10,180
Okay. Here we are. Attempt to what? We are attempting to sample that much.

641
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:15,640
But actually the values could be much, much smaller than that.

642
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:20,530
Okay. And we are running the first one. Second one.

643
01:16:21,100 --> 01:16:32,290
And here if you look at the values here, so that there is a we're using using these two, three values.

644
01:16:32,470 --> 01:16:35,620
See, so these the threshold can be negative.

645
01:16:35,620 --> 01:16:40,870
One threshold can be one and the threshold can be two.

646
01:16:41,150 --> 01:16:45,370
Okay. So then how does it change?

647
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:50,020
Okay. So then this is the result.

648
01:16:50,350 --> 01:16:58,300
This is a distribution of the this distribution where we use the envelope function with a normal level of function.

649
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:03,040
This is the case where use the exponential distribution as envelope function.

650
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:10,360
Okay. If you compare and this is this is a case where the threshold C called negative one.

651
01:17:10,390 --> 01:17:13,630
This is a case of sequel one. This is a case of sequel two.

652
01:17:13,900 --> 01:17:14,170
Okay.

653
01:17:15,580 --> 01:17:25,810
So if the threshold threshold was negative, sampling from normal distribution is totally fine because you're going to accept a lot of things, right?

654
01:17:26,380 --> 01:17:34,720
So here, if sequel negative one acceptance rate ratio is 84% when you use normal distribution.

655
01:17:34,840 --> 01:17:44,870
So that looks good. Uh, but, but if you use the exponential this feature, if it sees negative exponential, this result is simply from here.

656
01:17:44,950 --> 01:17:51,760
Right. So it'll always it'll be a little bit inefficient here, especially if the C is really small.

657
01:17:51,940 --> 01:17:56,080
Right. So exponential distribution is less efficient in the case.

658
01:17:56,560 --> 01:18:00,670
So only accept that 50%. Not too bad. But it's it's not.

659
01:18:00,670 --> 01:18:05,380
It's an idea. But when when sequel one.

660
01:18:05,410 --> 01:18:10,270
So now we are simply from one one standard deviation or greater.

661
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:16,390
Then it accepts only 15% and 16% roughly.

662
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:26,950
But if you use exponential distribution, it except 87%, if you use a sequel to the acceptance rate is a lot smaller.

663
01:18:26,950 --> 01:18:36,780
So you only you can utilize 2% of them because most of the random sample, the value doesn't fall into that particular range.

664
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:38,979
But an exponential distribution.

665
01:18:38,980 --> 01:18:45,850
You don't need to worry about going out of bounds because you're always sampling from value, you know, also starting from C,

666
01:18:45,850 --> 01:18:50,139
so all value is at least eligible in terms of the X range,

667
01:18:50,140 --> 01:18:57,460
although some of the things you need to drop out because the F and G is not exactly proportional.

668
01:18:58,030 --> 01:19:01,450
Okay. So. So.

669
01:19:01,690 --> 01:19:04,540
So 9090 3% are excepted.

670
01:19:04,540 --> 01:19:12,140
And it's going to get worse if you if you're for your party instead of using to, say, using three, then it's going to be even worse.

671
01:19:12,150 --> 01:19:16,390
So it's only accepting like a 0.1% here.

672
01:19:16,780 --> 01:19:22,560
Well, the exponential distribution does a good job with 96% of them are accepted in this view.

673
01:19:22,570 --> 01:19:30,940
So. So short short answer is that exponential distribution wins as long as a C is greater than zero.

674
01:19:31,090 --> 01:19:33,430
So that that's that's what it looks like here.

675
01:19:34,450 --> 01:19:43,780
But as I said, you can also modify the function for the normal distribution by shifting normal distribution.

676
01:19:44,010 --> 01:19:47,380
Okay. So that's something I would like to encourage you to try.

677
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:57,280
That's a very fun exercise. And you can you can still use this framework to try to modify your code and you know that that'll be a

678
01:19:57,640 --> 01:20:07,480
that'll be a good segway to go go to the solving the homework that is related to this exact reject method.

679
01:20:08,710 --> 01:20:16,900
Okay, so that's that. And we have office hours if you want, if you have time to discuss about your project or anything right after.

680
01:20:17,170 --> 01:20:22,180
And let's see you next week. We don't have a lecture in that Wednesday.

681
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:25,670
Okay. Just I'll make an estimate to about just so you.
