1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:06,328
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:06,328 --> 00:00:09,149
So just about any health
outcome that you can imagine,

3
00:00:09,149 --> 00:00:12,250
someone has linked to
something in the environment.

4
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:15,635
I'm just gonna spend a moment here and run
through a brief list of things that you

5
00:00:15,635 --> 00:00:19,375
might know or be aware of that are health
outcomes that we know definitively

6
00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:22,385
are tied to environmental factors.

7
00:00:22,385 --> 00:00:25,555
So one of the things that you may not
know about is the relationship between

8
00:00:25,555 --> 00:00:26,847
the built environment.

9
00:00:26,847 --> 00:00:30,177
Basically everything that humans
have constructed around us, from

10
00:00:30,177 --> 00:00:35,487
buildings we work and play in, to parks,
to roads and transportation networks.

11
00:00:35,487 --> 00:00:39,897
There's a very strong relationship between
what type of built environment you live in

12
00:00:39,897 --> 00:00:42,777
and your likelihood of becoming obese.

13
00:00:42,777 --> 00:00:47,577
You may also know, for example, that
inhalation of a chemical, carbon monoxide,

14
00:00:47,577 --> 00:00:50,457
can cause things that range
from being sleepy and

15
00:00:50,457 --> 00:00:53,990
tired, all the way up to asphyxiating and
dying.

16
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:58,125
You may also know that if you're exposed
to different kinds of air pollutants,

17
00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:01,211
that may put you at increased
risk of developing asthma over

18
00:01:01,211 --> 00:01:05,239
the course of your lifetime, especially
if your exposures start as a child.

19
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:09,297
You may also know that there are certain
types of chemicals that you can ingest

20
00:01:09,297 --> 00:01:10,670
that are lethal.

21
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:15,640
And in fact, a lot of what we know about
the element arsenic is a result of people

22
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:19,025
repeatedly using arsenic to kill
each other in the Middle Ages.

23
00:01:19,025 --> 00:01:23,320
Thus we have an extensive history
of toxicology with arsenic.

24
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,310
Of course, anything that you take
into your body through food or

25
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:31,580
water could be contaminated and could
result in foodborne or waterborne illness.

26
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:34,680
You probably know that exposure to
too much noise in the environment,

27
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,260
either at home or at work,
is associated with hearing loss.

28
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:41,400
You may not know that it's also
associated with an increased risk

29
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,770
of cardiovascular disease.

30
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,490
The most dangerous thing that most of
us do on any given day is getting into

31
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:48,430
our car.

32
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:53,608
That puts us at a fairly substantial
risk of an injury, or a fatal injury.

33
00:01:53,608 --> 00:01:57,468
You may also know that radon is a gas,
colorless, odorless,

34
00:01:57,468 --> 00:02:00,670
that's common in some parts
of the United States.

35
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:04,600
What you probably don't know is it's
the second leading cause of lung cancer,

36
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,880
behind only cigarette smoking.

37
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,810
Radon, in fact,

38
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:11,790
kills more people than drunk drivers
in the United States every year.

39
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:15,040
So you can see there's a whole list of
environmental hazards that we have to

40
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,490
be concerned about, and this is good for
exposure scientists like me.

41
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:23,290
There's no shortage, unfortunately,
of hazards for us to try to assess and

42
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:25,930
mitigate if we find a problem.

43
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:28,730
Now, one of the other defining
features of environmental health

44
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:33,040
is humans really are the cause of,
but also the solution to

45
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,320
all of the problems that relate to
health impacts from the environment.

46
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,870
In fact, our population has grown
exponentially over the past

47
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:43,910
thousand years or so,
and as we have more and

48
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:46,850
more humans on the planet,
we are impacting the environment.

49
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:50,350
Which in turn comes around and
impacts our health.

50
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:53,550
So you may not be aware but
on average, we're adding two and

51
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,778
a half people to this planet per second.

52
00:02:55,778 --> 00:02:59,500
That's the equivalent of
the country of Egypt each year.

53
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,837
And as the population continues to grow,
we're struggling and

54
00:03:02,837 --> 00:03:04,705
fighting with limited resources.

55
00:03:04,705 --> 00:03:08,730
All of this is very much a sustainability
issue, and sustainability is something

56
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:12,660
that goes hand in hand with
environmental health sciences.

57
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:16,560
So another topic that we often focus on
in environmental health are what we call

58
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,680
vulnerable populations.

59
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,072
And so these are people that
are exceptionally vulnerable to some

60
00:03:22,072 --> 00:03:23,860
environmental factor, maybe for

61
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:27,080
a reason like they're different
in terms of their exposure.

62
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,520
So they're different
than the typical person.

63
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,590
Or maybe they’re different
not in their exposure, but

64
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:35,010
rather in their susceptibility
to a particular disease.

65
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:39,030
Or maybe worst case scenario, they’re
different both in terms of exposure and

66
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,830
in terms of susceptibility.

67
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:44,940
So for these reasons, we focus very
much on vulnerable populations.

68
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,850
And to give you some examples of these,

69
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:50,260
I’m talking about things like
fetuses developing in the womb.

70
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:53,170
Very, very sensitive to
environmental hazards.

71
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:54,860
Or children even after they're born,

72
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:58,630
also exquisitely sensitive due to
the fact that they're developing.

73
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:02,390
Pregnant women represent a unique
vulnerable population in that we have to

74
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:05,700
worry about the environmental
health impacts on the mother, but

75
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,210
also on the developing fetus.

76
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:09,470
At the other end of the spectrum,

77
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:13,050
we're also interested in the elderly
as a vulnerable population.

78
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,312
For various reasons,

79
00:04:14,312 --> 00:04:17,610
they may be especially
susceptible to certain diseases.

80
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:20,530
Likewise, people who have
some pre-existing illness or

81
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:25,145
a disability may be vulnerable or more
vulnerable to environmental health hazards

82
00:04:25,145 --> 00:04:27,830
than other folks who are not disabled.

83
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:31,680
We spend a lot of time focusing
on environmental justice issues.

84
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,160
Meaning issues where environmental hazards
have not been spread equitably among

85
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,510
the population.

86
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:40,970
So for example,
low income communities often have much

87
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:45,750
worse exposures to environmental hazards
than relatively wealthier communities.

88
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:46,250
And of course,

89
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:51,170
we have to be concerned about people who
have genetic predispositions to disease.

90
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:55,250
Environmental hazards may further increase
their risk of developing a particular

91
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,040
disease.

92
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,450
So I'd like to switch gears for
a moment and have you look at a photo and

93
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:04,600
talk about some of the EHS
issues that we see.

94
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:09,358
So the photo you're looking at here is a
picture of a health care setting in a low

95
00:05:09,358 --> 00:05:11,028
or middle income country.

96
00:05:11,028 --> 00:05:14,282
What would I see here if I looked at
this with my environmental health

97
00:05:14,282 --> 00:05:15,420
sciences lens?

98
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:19,840
So what I would see here is a health care
setting that's very densely crowded.

99
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,570
We have people who are probably sick,

100
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,830
otherwise they wouldn't be
in a health care setting.

101
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:27,690
The denser and tighter we pack these
people, the more likely it is that they're

102
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:30,490
going to be transmitting
communicable diseases to each other.

103
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:33,862
Tuberculosis, Ebola, things like this.

104
00:05:33,862 --> 00:05:36,480
We are also seeing a setting in
which the health care providers

105
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,810
might not have proper
protective equipment.

106
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:42,200
So they're dealing with patients who
might have infectious disease and

107
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,100
are at risk of that.

108
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:47,200
Similarly, these health care professionals
might also be working with medical

109
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,380
instruments that aren't
properly sterilized.

110
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:52,534
So if they accidentally cut
themselves with a scalpel or

111
00:05:52,534 --> 00:05:57,244
poke themselves with a needle, they may
be infecting themselves inadvertently.

112
00:05:57,244 --> 00:06:00,851
We are also probably thinking about an
environment here where we can't very well

113
00:06:00,851 --> 00:06:02,510
control the temperature.

114
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:05,310
So this room could be incredibly hot, or

115
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:07,970
not able to be heated to
a comfortable temperature.

116
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:11,400
So lots of environmental health issues,
even if we take a look at something

117
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,800
as simple as a health care setting
in a low or middle income country.

118
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,280
On the other hand, if we look at a medical
setting in a high income country like

119
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,340
the United States,
we're looking at a different situation.

120
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:26,230
But there are still very much
environmental health hazards present here.

121
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:29,430
So we don't have quite
the density of patients here.

122
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:33,300
People often have separate rooms,
but what we do have is shift work.

123
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:38,130
We have doctors, nurses, aides,
technicians, working nights and days.

124
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:41,530
If you look at this picture, it's very
difficult to know what time of day it is.

125
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:46,320
So we've introduced maybe some mental
stressors here and exhaustion and fatigue.

126
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,570
We still have the issues of
patients potentially transmitting

127
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:52,720
infectious diseases to their
health care providers.

128
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,690
But in America, we also have issues
like the fact that nurses and

129
00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:02,920
aides are often lifting obese patients
into or out of chairs and onto beds.

130
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,200
And because these patients are so

131
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:09,280
heavy, back problems are a huge issue
in the health care provider community.

132
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,950
We also have something that's not so
common in low and middle income countries,

133
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:17,440
a very computer-centric workplace where
people may be sitting for hours at a time.

134
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,030
And we might have the development of
things like carpal tunnel syndrome and

135
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:22,750
other ergonomics issues.

136
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:26,160
So regardless of where we look,
high income, middle income or

137
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,560
low income countries, there's a huge range
of environmental health hazards that it's

138
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:36,873
our job to recognize, identify,
and control to a safe level.
