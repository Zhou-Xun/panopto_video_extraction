1
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:15,530
Usually beeps at me when it comes on, but not right now.

2
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:59,820
Hey, look at me. To bring.

3
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:07,920
There. Okay.

4
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:15,810
So I wanted to start today off with some announcements.

5
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:22,520
So remember that I set the date for the many review papers on the 1st of December.

6
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:29,160
Remember that? Okay. I am willing to extend that to the end of the semester if you would like.

7
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:34,340
Okay. Follow the format.

8
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:39,030
We went over the format and have you weren't here but we went over the format.

9
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,030
What are we expecting? You have any questions? Come see me.

10
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,780
But I pretty much went over it word for word.

11
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:51,150
What is going to be the expectation for the mini review? I also took a look at the.

12
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:55,780
The third example of the very thing that happens. Okay.

13
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:58,780
Was that helpful in terms of expectation? Yeah. All right. Okay.

14
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:08,830
So after today, the next three classes will be student presentations and then I'll give one and they'll be more student presentations.

15
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:14,710
So be prepared to answer questions and engage in discussion.

16
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:21,610
And the other thing that I wanted to mention is how I'm going to grade this.

17
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:28,440
So you go to show me.

18
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:41,770
So I have to. Let's see. Turn this off a second, and I have to go to the site and.

19
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,760
I have to go back there.

20
00:02:52,430 --> 00:03:07,170
Yes, I know. So I'm going to I'm going to pull up the grading sheet here once I figure out I decided to Google.

21
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:12,990
Here you go. Yeah.

22
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:36,370
Like the first time. Dogs.

23
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:45,820
You're in the back. Okay.

24
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:58,850
So here's the grading sheet. So every student will have an evaluation after you give the presentation.

25
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:09,140
These are the ten things that I'm going to be looking at. So you're going to be great on a scale of 1 to 5 one five being the top score.

26
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:14,120
So the first evaluation is your mastery of the subject matter,

27
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:20,870
whether you have gone into the introduction and learned quite a bit about what you're going to be talking

28
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:26,750
about and the model system that's used in the paper or the population that you're studying and so on.

29
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:31,100
So you want to be the authority in the classroom on that subject matter.

30
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:43,520
And it often pays to click on the links or look up the references from which the paper was derived or came from,

31
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,000
or the question that they're trying to address based on previous examples.

32
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:57,950
Okay. Your visual aids will be evaluated by did they add to the discussion in terms of did they illustrate what you're trying to say?

33
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:04,010
Are you showing the figures in a big enough size that everybody can read?

34
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:12,530
Is that your or is your font size big enough so that some person sitting in the back of the room can see what you are presenting,

35
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,820
those kinds of things? And then the quality of the background information.

36
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:22,760
Are you touching on issues that are related to the outcomes in your study that explain them?

37
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:34,080
Or are you just skimming the surface? Okay. Next, you'll be evaluating the quality of the questions.

38
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:39,570
Are other people engaged in answering questions?

39
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:45,959
Or did they? The questions provoke thought as they require critical thinking.

40
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:54,990
To answer the questions, you have to go back into the paper and look at the figures and and evaluate their outcomes to understand what's going on.

41
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:59,460
Are the main findings are important concepts addressed by the questions?

42
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:07,559
So if you had a paper with seven figures and you spent most of your time just talking about two of

43
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:16,860
the two figures that were not very deep in terms of how they described the outcomes of the study.

44
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:25,910
So I'm looking for. The discussion of some of the main points are what are the main points of the paper?

45
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:31,400
Okay. Do you know what I mean by that, Abby?

46
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:35,150
Yes. Okay. All right. And then leading discussions, you know,

47
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:45,560
is your presentation conducive to learning as everybody who's read your paper and had an engagement in the discussion process?

48
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:50,450
Is this something that people are going to come away with a lesson?

49
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:57,379
Are they going to remember it? This student needs to be able to master the paper and you end up reading it

50
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:02,660
like two or three or four more times to be an expert in that particular thing.

51
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:08,510
And then I'm looking for there to be everybody participating in discussion.

52
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,849
And then finally, I'm looking for the student who is leading the discussion,

53
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:20,089
who's giving the paper to be the one who's doing all of the talking to the person

54
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:24,350
who is leading the discussion and taking leadership and ownership of that paper.

55
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:27,410
And in previous versions of the class,

56
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:35,270
I've had unfortunate circumstances where other students in the class understood the paper better than the person who was presenting.

57
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:39,140
And that was a very uncomfortable situation for the presenter.

58
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:43,850
Okay. So be the expert in a room with your subject matter.

59
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:51,560
And if you've chosen the paper that's beyond your capability, come see me and reevaluate.

60
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:57,430
Okay. So a week from today, Abby is going to be giving a presentation,

61
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:05,540
and the week that I can't remember who is giving the presentation on the following Tuesday.

62
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,190
Okay. We need to get a paper from you very soon. Oh, yeah.

63
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:14,060
Thursday. Okay. Okay. I was getting out there today.

64
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:17,900
Yeah. You're presenting the weekly finding on. Yes. Yes.

65
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,480
Okay. And then. And the next Tuesday. Right. Okay.

66
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:26,450
So I got a paper from Rana, and I think.

67
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:32,120
I think I posted Valerie here tonight. Or maybe I didn't know.

68
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:35,840
I might not have posted because you just haven't given me questions yet.

69
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:40,670
So you'll see that the questions that go along with the paper very shortly.

70
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:44,570
Okay. Are there any questions about how I'm going to grade?

71
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:53,650
No. Okay. All right, I'll put this away.

72
00:08:56,770 --> 00:09:00,530
You're. All right.

73
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:09,469
So so far we've talked about how having a deficiency in a particular micronutrient affects how you would

74
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:17,900
respond to an infectious disease or how a particular component in food affects an immune response.

75
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:29,030
This story is a little bit different in that it's the infection that causes the iron deficiency in people who have HIV.

76
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:35,390
So the title of the paper is The Role of Diet and Predicting Iron Deficiency Anemia in HIV Positive Women.

77
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:52,180
And just a little background. HIV. So this is the estimated number of people living with HIV in 2016, 2021.

78
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:56,019
I thought I'd upload it on the latest graph.

79
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,160
That may be hilarious.

80
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:08,830
So you still see the same kind of pattern in terms of where you find the highest concentration of people living with HIV and in sub-Saharan Africa,

81
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:15,940
in in Southern Asia. And this is a huge number of individuals.

82
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:26,800
So we're talking about over 30 million people in the world globally who are living with HIV in lower numbers in some other regions of the planet.

83
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:37,050
And this is the 2021 graph which wasn't as visually as appealing as the previous one.

84
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:45,610
Yeah, I find it interesting that they're on the next slide, but there's no data for us.

85
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:50,430
Yeah, there's, there's I bit more data here from them.

86
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,480
Yeah. But this is the latest. I've just found this before class. This is 2022.

87
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:01,710
This just came out and yeah, no data available, not applicable and so on.

88
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:08,760
So it could be with they're trying to do these updates and they didn't have the latest data available.

89
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:16,350
But for the most part, you know, these these numbers probably haven't changed a whole lot since till 2016, maybe a little.

90
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:20,910
Um, but here, here are some numbers.

91
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:26,220
This is a visually appealing slide. The maps show you where where the infections occur.

92
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:30,569
Here is number of people. So total people living with HIV.

93
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:38,550
It's gone up a little bit, about 38, nine people who acquired HIV in 2021, about one and a half million.

94
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:47,699
And then this. And then people dying of HIV related causes, 650,000 worldwide.

95
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:53,370
And this numbers because there's still a huge number of people.

96
00:11:53,990 --> 00:12:04,650
Um, so the subsequent roles adults, women, men and children who are in these various categories.

97
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:12,930
So we're talking about a huge number of individuals who are infected with HIV and then how many

98
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:18,030
have acquired it most recently and how many deaths are there as a consequence of this disease?

99
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:25,620
So this hasn't gone away, okay? It's distant from our memory because we hear a lot less about it in the United States.

100
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:30,300
But it's still there and it's still problematic.

101
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:39,959
And the National Institutes of Health have funded an awful lot of research projects aimed at understanding the disease process,

102
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:50,460
which we'll talk about this morning, and most importantly, how whether or not they can create a vaccine against HIV.

103
00:12:50,910 --> 00:13:05,940
And those efforts have not been very successful. So the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome is caused by the human immunodeficiency

104
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:13,650
virus and it primarily affects infects that CD4 positive T cell to help our T cells.

105
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:19,830
But it can also infect monocytes and macrophages, dendritic cells as well.

106
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:29,100
And over time, over a course of several years, the population of CD4 positive T-cells declines.

107
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:34,649
And this is when you see manifestations of the immunodeficiency occurring,

108
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:44,879
where people who have this condition are more susceptible to infectious diseases, they're more susceptible to certain types of cancers.

109
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:54,330
And when you have a healthy immune system, you can easily defend yourself against these infections and not develop certain types of cancers.

110
00:13:56,180 --> 00:14:00,259
So how does the disease process, how does it happen?

111
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:06,140
How do you get infected and what's the immune process that occurs?

112
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:19,519
So in the first portion of this illustration, you have the intraepithelial dendritic cells and they bind to the HIV virus.

113
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:29,059
With this receptor expressed in the surface of the DC, the dendritic cell, the sink or SAG.

114
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:34,430
And this is a way for the virus to get into this antigen presenting cell.

115
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:43,999
Okay, so it's internalized into these endosomes and then when that dendritic cell drains

116
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,190
into goes through the lymphatic system and drains in the local lymph nodes,

117
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:58,370
the virus is actually externalized and then it's presented to the CD4+ positive T cells and then lymph nodes.

118
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:07,020
And this is where the T cells take it up. So how does this occur and why?

119
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:12,540
Why are we seeing mostly CD4 T cells affected by this virus?

120
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:22,320
So viruses are taken up by different tissues and cells based on tropism for that virus, for that particular cell type.

121
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:31,410
And it turns out it's the CD4 sector and the city for surface markers, I should say.

122
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,239
Yeah. And a CO receptor and the COA sector can be a chemokine receptor.

123
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:45,180
CCR five or six, therefore can be the car receptor that allows the virus to enter the city for t cell.

124
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:57,310
So here you have the the viral envelope fuzing with the cell membrane and allowing this genome, the viral genome to enter the cell.

125
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,470
And then the next step is the reverse transcriptase of the viral RNA.

126
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,890
DNA genomes are are copied.

127
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:11,470
And if you double stranded DNA. So this is the viral DNA.

128
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:20,260
This is in the cytoplasm now and then that is taken up into the nucleus and it enters the host DNA.

129
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:27,550
So that's the pro virus. And then the T cell, it becomes activated in response to this infection.

130
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:33,700
And there is a low level of transcription of this pro virus that will naturally have the virus.

131
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:38,740
And then you have the RNA produced in the RNA.

132
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:51,160
You have things that enhance the polymerization of the RNA RNA polymerase you have via various viral proteins that are produced.

133
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:56,230
And then in the later stages of the infection of these cells,

134
00:16:57,070 --> 00:17:04,750
you have the production of proteins that will assemble and form this exterior coat of this particular virus.

135
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:10,719
And I am giving you a very brief summary here of this.

136
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:16,090
And if you want to know the details as shown in the notes portion of this particular slide.

137
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:25,780
Anyhow, this is how a T cell, a CD4 positive T cell is infected with the HIV virus,

138
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:32,290
how it how it can replicate in the cell and how it escapes and goes on to infect other cell types.

139
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:40,330
So remember what CD4 positive T cells do.

140
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:49,300
They help macrophages and other cells of the innate immune system defend yourself against infection.

141
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:55,930
And they can drop a T cell.

142
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:58,960
In this case, it's a follicular T cell in the bottom portion.

143
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:08,770
It can present or help a B cell in this case produce antibodies.

144
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:17,860
Okay. So when you have a condition in which your CD for T cells decline, you lose these functions.

145
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:35,460
So the initial infection and the development of the systemic symptomatic phase can take several years.

146
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:45,750
And in this particular illustration, you have three or two different colored lines here.

147
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:55,890
The green has to do with the CD4 t cell count and the red has to do with the HIV RNA copies.

148
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,900
So this which is what you can measure actually in somebody who's been infected.

149
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:09,690
So in the in the first phase of the infection, so many can experience flu like symptoms.

150
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:16,560
And this happens most of the time. But you might acquire the infection and not have any symptoms.

151
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:25,270
So initially in response to the infection that CD4 t cell count drops and it doesn't

152
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:35,290
get below the critical value of 200 cells per a unit of five per microliter.

153
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:46,059
But it drops and this is a could be an indicator of having the infection during this time in the early phase,

154
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:55,180
a 2 to 6 weeks after infection, there's an increase in that in the RNA copies and then that declines after about six weeks.

155
00:19:55,180 --> 00:20:05,430
And then from this period on, you have a time of seroconversion where you can actually measure antibodies against the virus.

156
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:15,670
And after this occurs, you can have a period of up to ten years before you enter the symptomatic phase.

157
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:27,130
And in this particular time period, you have death of the city for positive T-cells because the virus replicates,

158
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:34,990
it kills the ticks, the CD for positive T cells and other city for positive T cells, and it kills them as well.

159
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,570
And then remember that other cell types like tissue, macrophages and.

160
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:50,420
Circulating cells, monocytes and dendritic cells can also harbor the virus.

161
00:20:52,850 --> 00:21:00,710
So you get to a certain level of city for positive T cells where you start to enter the symptomatic phase.

162
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:09,500
And this is a period in which you go from 500 C for T cells per microliter down to 200 and less.

163
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:20,960
And when you get to this critical threshold of 247 per microliter, this is when you have the acquired immune deficiency syndrome.

164
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:30,590
Okay. And if this isn't treated, the death will occur from many different possibilities,

165
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:34,640
usually an infectious disease and sometimes by a certain type of cancer.

166
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:41,480
So here are the opportunistic pathogens and cancers that kill AIDS patients.

167
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:53,630
So opportunistic infections are those that are normally not life threatening that somebody who has a normal function,

168
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:57,050
a normal functioning immune system, can handle very easily.

169
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:07,340
And there's a list of parasites, intracellular bacteria, fungi and viruses that can be lethal to somebody who has AIDS.

170
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:19,850
So some of that I mentioned earlier that tuberculosis is a leading cause of death in HIV patients in Africa.

171
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:28,160
There are many other types of species of organisms that can also lead to death in North America.

172
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:31,510
You'll see a lot of people with cryptococcus neoformans infection.

173
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:39,140
This is a fungi that if you have a normal functioning immune system that you can handle just fine.

174
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:49,310
If not, it can lead to systemic infection and infection of actually the brain leading to the death as a consequence.

175
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:58,610
And then there are some viruses mentioned here. So those are some opportunistic infections that you can see in somebody who has AIDS.

176
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:08,660
So this is people who are treated now with the antiretroviral therapy in terms of cancers or malignancies,

177
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:16,010
capaci sarcoma, which is probably one of the most common types of cancers that people who have AIDS get.

178
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:20,330
And then there are some others listed. There are non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

179
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:27,790
There are the BRIC. It's lymphoma and then primary lymphoma.

180
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:41,700
Right. So in about 1995 or between 1994 and 1995, there was this combination therapy that was used.

181
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:51,480
It's a cocktail of drugs that revolutionized the treatment of this particular condition.

182
00:23:51,490 --> 00:24:03,840
So they're given with drugs. It's essentially this is an antiretroviral drug, and it dramatically increased the survival of people who had AIDS.

183
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:07,710
So this is that the standard of care for this now?

184
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:17,550
And most people who have AIDS, who have HIV don't develop AIDS because of this therapy and can function normally and have a normal life.

185
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:22,200
As a consequence of this treatment. So this is revolutionary.

186
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:29,340
Whether or not people who are on this drug are cured is a matter of debate.

187
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:37,680
So if you have one cell that still harbors the virus and you go off the therapy,

188
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:46,260
there's the potential to develop AIDS as a consequence because the bug or the virus may still be hiding in the host.

189
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:50,280
That's why when you start the therapy, you stay on it the rest of your life.

190
00:24:54,520 --> 00:25:00,760
So that's that. Let's look at some of the background in terms of what we know about anemia and iron deficiency and HIV.

191
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:13,210
So in terms of co-morbidities associated with HIV, besides other types of infections and cancers, anemia is the most common.

192
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,020
So and how is this measured?

193
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:26,800
So anemia would be what you would would be diagnosed with if you had a hemoglobin concentration that are below the thresholds,

194
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:33,370
120 grams per liter for women and 140 grams per deciliter for men.

195
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:41,590
And the prevalence of anemia increases as the disease progresses,

196
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:49,960
especially when the CD for positive T-cell count goes below this 200 cells for microliter level.

197
00:25:53,360 --> 00:26:01,250
So an iron deficiency without anemia. This is a condition in which you're depleting your storage of iron.

198
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:08,570
You might not have developed anemia yet, but your iron stores are below where they should be.

199
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:18,060
So so this is a moderate, moderate level of iron depletion and this is measured by ferritin.

200
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:25,310
And remember, this is the intracellular storage location or site for iron.

201
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:30,650
And the threshold that's often seen in the literature is 30 micro moles per liter.

202
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:36,290
And this can be without reduced hemoglobin concentration.

203
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:45,290
And I mentioned the hemoglobin levels. So if you find low levels of ferritin, this would indicate iron deficiency without anemia.

204
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:56,330
So in untreated iron deficiency, if you let this go for a long period of time without providing some kind of supplemental iron,

205
00:26:56,780 --> 00:27:06,200
it often results in iron deficiency anemia, and this can affect the number of red blood cells that are produced as a consequence.

206
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:11,240
And then you would find lower RBC is being produced lower hematocrit,

207
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:21,440
or you might see some signs of iron deficiency anemia or abnormal morphology of the red blood cells.

208
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:32,310
So other ways to measure iron deficiency is transparent saturation, which would also be which would also decline.

209
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:39,270
So here's some characteristics or categories of different types of anemia and what

210
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:43,200
they would look like if you took a blood sample from someone who had this condition.

211
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:51,210
So in the number one portion of this illustration, this is micro acidic type of chronic anemia,

212
00:27:52,920 --> 00:28:03,210
so that the red cells are smaller and they lose that red red pigmentation because you don't have enough iron to to to make hemoglobin.

213
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:11,340
Here's another particular type of anemia, macro acidic, normal chromate.

214
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:17,400
So they have a normal appearance in terms of their color, but they're larger in their appearance.

215
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:25,800
They're not a smaller size. And this would indicate problems with maturation of those red blood cells.

216
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:31,320
And then finally, you can have a normal, acidic, normal, chronic anemia.

217
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:38,120
So these are the different types of anemia.

218
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:46,560
And here's the in the example shown in the third figure, you have a small nucleus of a small lymphocyte.

219
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:50,610
Showing the arrow is a reference to the size of the red blood cell.

220
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:57,690
So if you're you're trying to say, okay, how do you know by just looking at them what size they should be?

221
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:04,650
Well, this is the size they should be. And this is what they appear to be in these different conditions.

222
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:12,340
So here's one. Here's a lymphocyte. In this case, they're about the same size, maybe a little bit smaller here.

223
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:17,940
They're quite a bit smaller than the lymphocyte. And the here, they're all bigger than the this.

224
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:27,730
So what was the purpose of this study based on that background?

225
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:37,660
Go ahead, Alina. I think one of the purposes of the study was to determine different risk factors for developing anemia among women with HIV.

226
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:45,130
Right. Right. So how about some other things?

227
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:49,060
So anemia, we know, has an impact on quality of life and HIV progression.

228
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:58,390
Right. And they wanted to examine the association between medical, social, nutrition factors and anemia in HIV positive women.

229
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:07,660
And then to answer the question, is there a direct relationship between iron intake and iron status in this population?

230
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:16,160
Okay. So let's see how this turns out.

231
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:24,409
Some question to why were the authors interested in assessing anemia and iron

232
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:33,229
status in HIV positive women that have been most commonly associated with HIV,

233
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:37,270
especially women? Right.

234
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:51,140
Yeah. So if you look at the prevalence of anemia in HIV positive cases, 55% in women, 45% in men,

235
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:59,120
and the overall prevalence of anemia in women living in the US is far lower, about 7.6%.

236
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:07,040
And then if you break this down by different age groups and different ethnicities, you find some disparities here as well.

237
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:11,690
So 10% in women, 40 to 49 years of age.

238
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:17,480
15% in the overall in the overall non-Hispanic black men and women.

239
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:25,220
But when you look at non-Hispanic black women in this age category, you find that it's 26%.

240
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:51,180
Okay. So, um, HIV is and anemia is the major cause of HIV, and it's as a consequence of blood loss from inflammation, bone marrow suppression,

241
00:31:52,170 --> 00:32:03,690
disruption of the intestinal epithelial cell replication and, and women in particular, due to menstruation, they lose a lot of iron.

242
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,649
Um, and in childbirth and this is all.

243
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:15,280
And despite the availability of antiretroviral therapy, anemia remains unaffected.

244
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:26,640
In other words, even though people have they have access to these types of drugs, anemia is still a significant cause of concern in this population.

245
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:30,600
All right. So question three.

246
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:39,570
Describe the methods used to assess anemia and iron status and the representative sample of HIV positive women in Vancouver, Canada.

247
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:53,530
So sorry. Iron deficiency anemia was diagnosed if their human globin was lower than 120 gram by later and also their

248
00:32:53,530 --> 00:33:06,160
ferritin less than 30 micro was sort of like a marker for beta and also the iron status of different.

249
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:11,190
Yes. Okay.

250
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:15,710
So this was. Yeah. Okay.

251
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:19,560
There is always about iron deficiency. Um, yeah.

252
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:24,990
Less than 120 grams per liter and then less than 30 micro moles.

253
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:29,159
And then this was a this was just a cross-sectional study.

254
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:41,280
So they recruited these individuals, um, they gave them a $10, $10 to participate in the study, um, which is quite low.

255
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:48,570
Um, so I was even, even when this was published, it's quite low.

256
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:56,760
How much do you think you would get if here at the University of Michigan, if you participated in a study that involved a blood draw?

257
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:07,950
250 $250, do you think? I mean, definitely more than more than $10, certainly.

258
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:19,290
So I was in the the Janson trial with J and J vaccine and they they gave me $100 every time they drew blood for me.

259
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:30,360
Okay. So at the time this was before that we knew a whole lot of the effectiveness about the effectiveness of the RNA vaccines,

260
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:37,470
and there was a shortage of them. And the only way I could get a vaccine was to participate in the study.

261
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:43,590
So I did, and I didn't know whether I was going to be in the placebo or the treatment group.

262
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:48,899
So they gave me the direct injection and I felt sore the next day.

263
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:54,270
So I knew I got the vaccine and then every time they draw blood, they would give me $100.

264
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:59,100
And that was an incentive here. So this is really, really low.

265
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:04,350
Okay. So they had to do an awful lot to participate in this study.

266
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:10,499
They had to fill out this food frequency questionnaire. They had to document their use of supplements.

267
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:17,550
They had to document their menstrual pattern, whether or not they were a vegetarian, how they prepared their food,

268
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:23,940
whether or not they had food insecurity and they had other things that they had to write their BMI,

269
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:29,070
their medical conditions, their immune status and anemia related measurements.

270
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:36,450
Okay. So what's the sample size?

271
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:45,480
Adequate to address the purpose of the study? Yeah.

272
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:57,640
Gotcha. I think the total was maybe the number of that was not not the small, but like if they divided into different cities for different conditions,

273
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:04,060
they were information about the small size of a small sample size for that was the limitation.

274
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,549
Yeah, that's a significant limitation there.

275
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:12,670
When you only start out with a 105 in this case and then you're looking at different ethnicities in terms of

276
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:20,900
looking at that as some kind of a predictor or an indicator of having a more severe anemia as a consequence.

277
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:25,330
Yeah, then you lose your statistical power. So they had 101 or two total.

278
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:30,220
These were HIV positive women. They were 19 years of age.

279
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:36,880
They were not currently pregnant. They had information of their CD4 count, but it was above this threshold,

280
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:42,160
and they recruited them from three different community health clinics throughout the city.

281
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:48,370
Um, and then this is where this came up.

282
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:51,819
So I didn't, I didn't put this right in the animation.

283
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:57,820
So this is a free food frequency questionnaire to assess dietary iron intake.

284
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:01,780
Is it an accurate way to assess this end point? If not, why? Go ahead, Abby.

285
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:06,520
I mean I mean, like you said in the study. Yes, but in general.

286
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:10,480
No. Just because trying on the riot record, it's just.

287
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:18,110
Especially over time and different ages.

288
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:21,770
I mean, once you I can. I can't remember what I had this maybe like.

289
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:26,540
Right. Yeah. Much less I and, like, how much you ate.

290
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:33,590
So there's a lot of, like, variance and the accuracy of, like, what someone actually doing to what they're recording.

291
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:37,700
Do you think your memory would be a little bit better if you had to prepare all your meals?

292
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:46,260
Maybe, but maybe. Right. But you might not know exactly how much you rate.

293
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:52,890
Yeah. And that's that's the big problem with any kind of dietary assessment.

294
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:57,330
You might not remember what you ate, but not necessarily how many servings you had.

295
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:02,070
How about snacks throughout the day? Can you remember? Can we remember that?

296
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:06,390
That's even harder to remember in terms of how many snacks you consumed.

297
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:12,840
So estimating anything? Caloric intake or iron, you know that that can be a problem.

298
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:18,330
And you got something to add to this? I was just going to say that measurement is super inaccurate.

299
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:23,130
Like, I feel like even if you do prepare your meals unless maybe,

300
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:29,820
like maybe you have diabetes and need to know like the proportion that you're the average

301
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:36,830
person is not like measuring like one tablespoon of oil or anything like that one gram,

302
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:43,770
right? You just kind of toss it in there. That looks like a to two tablespoons and you go and you have at it.

303
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:49,229
Another point that I wanted to bring up here in terms of describe and say they're

304
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:54,690
also like three share doesn't really take into account that different brands.

305
00:38:55,050 --> 00:39:03,620
The difference between values and all the things. So even if you can't get the amount and the serving size correct, it's very important.

306
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:07,020
Like what type of screening, where are you going to get things from?

307
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:10,890
Like that type of thing? Yeah, that's not so different from person to person.

308
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:18,030
And from a cultural standpoint, you're going there from all different ethnicities.

309
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:22,230
So one, two frequency for sure isn't fit for everyone.

310
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:30,930
Right. Yeah. They have to be tailored to meet that particular, um, the culture of that particular ethnic group that you're trying to assess.

311
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:37,920
So all of these things could compromise the value of that, these end points that they're trying to measure.

312
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:48,470
So what was the prevalence of anemia, iron deficiency and prevalence in iron deficiency anemia?

313
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:01,550
Anybody. Anybody besides Abby. He wants to go over this. Abby is up the ladder, and so anemia.

314
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:06,559
The prevalence was 30%. Iron deficiency, 40 hour and deficiency.

315
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:21,650
Anemia, 60%. Yeah. So, you know, most people without anemia and that's a fair amount with you're looking at the thresholds now based on hemoglobin.

316
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:27,260
Okay. 108 is 128, which is still kind of low in this group here.

317
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:37,720
So in terms of the city for positive T-cell counts, there was no difference in this group.

318
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:52,390
Not significant, but there was a trend still fairly close to 340 versus 383 and levels, um, quite a bit lower, 11 versus 58.

319
00:40:53,920 --> 00:41:06,190
Um, transparent is another way to measure this and transparent saturation, some other measures of iron deficiency measurements for a deficiency.

320
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:21,380
Okay. So the other point that they brought up here was that only 42 participants actually had their chins measured.

321
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:35,380
Yeah. Um, I have a question about this table. Is it not common to write or to add, like the normal range or the values in here?

322
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:40,910
Because I feel like, I don't know, an average person reading this wouldn't know how to interpret.

323
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:43,730
Right, that. That's correct. Yeah.

324
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:53,120
So when you get, when you are a patient and you have a blood sample taken and they're looking at all kinds of parameters, right?

325
00:41:53,720 --> 00:42:01,190
Yes. They give you the normal range. And that should be something that should be included in the in the footnote here to the table.

326
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:06,110
But sometimes it's not it depends on how much data is something they're presenting here.

327
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:17,540
What is really helpful is if you make a graph graphs, communicate a whole lot more information in a way that our brains are used to processing.

328
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:24,980
So if you had a graph and you had a different graph for each different parts of this table,

329
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:33,200
you could include a dash line indicating what the thresholds are for these different values that you're expected to find.

330
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:39,890
And that kind of makes it a lot easier to see the data in a way that you can stand very quickly.

331
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:51,469
So in clinical cohort studies and in epi studies, there's lots of tables.

332
00:42:51,470 --> 00:43:01,850
And if you can take that table and turn it into a graph of some sort, people are not only going to understand the information,

333
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:08,690
but they're more probably more likely to cite the paper because they can actually see it and understand it a lot more quickly.

334
00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:18,190
So yeah, those are the values that are highlighted here in these orange lines.

335
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:26,080
So what was the prevalence of anemia?

336
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:31,710
According to race and ethnicity. I do.

337
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:43,390
Go ahead, Abby. Oh, I. And then they brought that. The woman's iron deficiency.

338
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:48,600
It was mainly black and white, more and more South Asian cities.

339
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:51,750
But those are just more lives. Yeah, they had this car, so.

340
00:43:52,110 --> 00:44:00,390
Yeah. So when you start out with 102 and you break it down to these different ethnic groups, you really dealing with a really small number.

341
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:12,600
And the statistical power isn't great enough to draw conclusions based on the small sample size.

342
00:44:13,170 --> 00:44:22,650
So whenever you look at a population study or an EPI study, yes, you need to look at the number of participants,

343
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:27,810
but also when they do these subanalysis, how many people are being compared?

344
00:44:28,470 --> 00:44:40,740
And then based on those numbers in the sub analysis, then you can say, okay, this is underpowered or powered enough or whatever the case may be.

345
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:46,020
And then in some papers they'll actually do a power calculation to tell you what how many

346
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:52,920
subjects they need to think to confidently say that there's maybe differences in the group.

347
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:58,230
So generally you have some. Can you comment on that because you deal with these datasets all the time?

348
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:03,479
Yeah, definitely. The the sample size was pretty small.

349
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:10,230
And I am surprised that the editors didn't say, why are you breaking apart here?

350
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:13,559
Yeah. Sample size is 5%.

351
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:22,440
It's not based one person. Yeah, I think probably the only conclusion you can draw from it.

352
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:29,220
It's the mystery probably. But still the best sample size.

353
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:34,530
Yeah. Yeah. As a difference between the the population with and without any.

354
00:45:36,410 --> 00:45:42,260
Yeah. So yeah, that's that is certainly a limitation of this study.

355
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:47,389
So, you know, they give you other information like past that you could present past and present.

356
00:45:47,390 --> 00:45:51,770
Vegetarianism. Multivitamin supplement use.

357
00:45:53,510 --> 00:45:57,950
Which wasn't statistically significant. So like 911 versus 47.

358
00:45:58,530 --> 00:46:03,230
Yeah. Just the kind which kind of surprised me.

359
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:10,430
But then again, you're looking at we doing the comparison in terms of the percentage here.

360
00:46:12,330 --> 00:46:19,680
And then food assistance to use in terms of determine whether or not somebody is food insecure and whether they're better for that.

361
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:29,070
All right. So what were the most important predictors of iron deficiency anemia shown here?

362
00:46:33,850 --> 00:46:43,260
Go ahead, Ilana. Um African ethnically regular Nigerian pattern in the report count below 200.

363
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:52,180
Yeah. So all the things that we talked about originally and besides the racial difference here in terms of.

364
00:46:54,860 --> 00:47:00,440
This being a bigger problem? Did it surprise any of you?

365
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:20,610
So I thought maybe I just missed this. But they said that the C-4 was one of their inclusion criteria.

366
00:47:21,390 --> 00:47:27,050
I thought they weren't supposed to include people with less than 200 like that value.

367
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:31,290
So, yeah, I don't understand.

368
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:36,030
Yes, that's you know, they added this here and then it's kind of confusing.

369
00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:42,030
It's like, okay, wait a minute, you excluded people. You said that they put it in there.

370
00:47:42,270 --> 00:47:51,390
Yeah. So oftentimes when you're dealing with journals that are.

371
00:47:54,950 --> 00:48:01,069
Small in terms of the number of papers that they publish a year and the focus of that particular journal,

372
00:48:01,070 --> 00:48:08,960
you might not get very many papers, so the editors might be less selective in terms of what they accept.

373
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:11,089
Nowadays,

374
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:23,990
there are so many different online journals that the acceptance of some of these papers is embarrassingly high for a number of these newer journals,

375
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:30,920
to the point where some journals don't even appear to do any kind of critical review or analysis in the paper.

376
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:35,660
So that's something you should pay attention to as well.

377
00:48:36,170 --> 00:48:43,850
If you look at a journal you might want to see, go to the go to the website and look for information for authors.

378
00:48:45,210 --> 00:48:50,250
And then find that information and it will tell you how many papers or what percent

379
00:48:50,250 --> 00:48:54,600
of the papers that are submitted to them are actually accepted for publication.

380
00:48:55,050 --> 00:49:00,300
And that'll give you something, some indicator of the rigor of the review process.

381
00:49:05,350 --> 00:49:15,000
Okay. So how did each of these predictors influence iron status, African ethnicity?

382
00:49:16,290 --> 00:49:26,550
This was a predictor, right? So people of African ethnicity and not their nine times more likely to have an iron deficiency anemia.

383
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:31,800
Participants were recent immigrants from Africa.

384
00:49:33,150 --> 00:49:46,530
So remember that the illustration that I showed earlier where the you have the most most of the HIV concentration is concentrated in Africa,

385
00:49:46,530 --> 00:49:55,740
sub-Saharan Africa. So this is where these people are coming from, emigrating from India, and they have this condition.

386
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:06,510
So in regard to African ethnicity, they're more likely to have food insecurity based on their use of food assistance program.

387
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:13,740
But again, they're able to make this conclusion. You would need a bigger sample size to draw that conclusion.

388
00:50:16,970 --> 00:50:27,830
They have a moment here. I don't know how important it will be, but like the time since diagnosis, because I don't think they have proper for that.

389
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:34,580
So probably with time they would develop more and more symptoms like symptoms like iron deficiency.

390
00:50:34,610 --> 00:50:41,750
Yeah, that's certainly true. I'm trying to think back and when I was reading.

391
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:49,140
Where are these people treated with anti-retroviral therapy?

392
00:50:49,230 --> 00:51:05,070
Do you remember that being mentioned? Most of them.

393
00:51:05,830 --> 00:51:12,719
Right. Okay. That would be 75%. Right. So you have still 25% of people who weren't.

394
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:18,150
And this is this is probably the group that had no CD4 t cell counts.

395
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:31,510
Okay. All right. So the people with the low city, 14 cell counts are nine times more likely to develop an iron deficiency anemia.

396
00:51:36,030 --> 00:51:51,060
So they're going to have low CD4+ T cell counts and bone marrow suppression so their bone marrow isn't going to be producing enough red blood cells.

397
00:51:51,390 --> 00:52:00,240
And as a consequence of low having low iron levels and with this particular condition,

398
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:05,710
they're going to have chronic inflammation associated with having a low CTE for t cell count.

399
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:11,310
And this is going to affect this could affect the absorption of micronutrients as well.

400
00:52:12,810 --> 00:52:21,240
So all of these factors can from just the T cell standpoint, being low can affect iron status.

401
00:52:24,630 --> 00:52:30,980
And then what's described in these people had opportunistic infections.

402
00:52:30,990 --> 00:52:39,569
I don't believe in this particular study, but this is also something that's going to compromise iron status as well,

403
00:52:39,570 --> 00:52:47,070
because you're essentially losing the iron through blood and you excrete iron through the feces primarily.

404
00:52:47,070 --> 00:52:53,490
And this is another way to lose iron besides through menstruation and during infection.

405
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:59,700
Okay, how about regular menstrual pattern? It's not researched widely in HIV women.

406
00:53:01,350 --> 00:53:04,920
It may significantly affect iron status in women.

407
00:53:07,170 --> 00:53:12,150
There's little difference in menstrual cycle between HIV positive and HIV negative women.

408
00:53:12,810 --> 00:53:23,160
However, if you have a high viral titer and low CD4 t cell counts, the menstrual cycle may be variable and irregular,

409
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:29,549
and you can have a condition called poly ment area where there's an increase in blood loss from

410
00:53:29,550 --> 00:53:35,010
having more frequent periods and a greater risk of developing that iron deficiency anemia.

411
00:53:37,410 --> 00:53:41,250
So what are some confounders besides sample size?

412
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:53,240
Yeah. Um, the dietary intake from the FSU did not correlate with their actual status.

413
00:53:58,350 --> 00:54:07,170
Right. What else? See what we got down here. After adjusting for AIA, take no significant exception between dietary intake and item status.

414
00:54:09,950 --> 00:54:14,360
Iron intake was too low to enable detection differences.

415
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:25,960
So it was around 11 days that what I remember the exact number 11 milligrams per day that you should that the expectation the RDA is routine right.

416
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:48,389
So I think also I was checking the age for they speak of menstruation patterns, but the mean age of the women are 40%.

417
00:54:48,390 --> 00:54:52,310
So I don't know how many of those are, you know.

418
00:54:53,650 --> 00:55:00,650
On reproductive age. Iron intakes for meat.

419
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:09,710
About 0.14 milligrams were significantly less than women with HIV or women.

420
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:24,200
Without HIV, I should say. Other factors, not significantly associated iron deficiency anemia because the sample size was too small.

421
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:28,810
Vegetarian status multivitamin use and iron supplementation.

422
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:37,340
So these are some issues that couldn't be addressed by the paper because they only had 102 participants.

423
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:46,220
The food insecurity question would have been an interesting one in terms of whether or not that was a contributing factor.

424
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:58,220
So there's a 61% prevalence of food insecurity in the sample was three times for single and single parent households.

425
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:13,880
So the impact of poverty on nutritional status and these HIV positive women can't be understated among the women from from Africa,

426
00:56:13,930 --> 00:56:19,640
African-American, I'm sorry, women of African origin and then the Aboriginal population.

427
00:56:20,090 --> 00:56:35,090
So in western Canada you have a large number of Aboriginal individuals who were native to western Canada, living throughout British Columbia,

428
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:51,740
and many of these are in the lower socioeconomic group and have issues related to their their racial and ethnic status that compromised their health.

429
00:56:52,340 --> 00:57:01,910
And one of these factors is that many of them are Russians and many of them, some of them acquired immunodeficiency virus.

430
00:57:02,690 --> 00:57:06,710
So this was a relatively small population living in Vancouver.

431
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:16,729
And I imagine if they expanded this study to include not just community centers but medical centers throughout the province,

432
00:57:16,730 --> 00:57:28,760
they may have gotten a bigger sample size. So yeah.

433
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:32,959
So there were a number of limitations then.

434
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:36,740
This is the one that I didn't hide.

435
00:57:36,740 --> 00:57:44,030
Why would you only have 42 of 102 terms of the number of measurements?

436
00:57:45,050 --> 00:57:56,540
So again, if this were done, if these studies had a multi-center type of population where you had hospitals now,

437
00:57:56,540 --> 00:58:01,819
which were the hubs of these collecting this data,

438
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:14,570
you might have gotten a larger number of people would fare in days if you had medical centers where the Aboriginal population had it was more common.

439
00:58:14,990 --> 00:58:19,190
You might have gotten a bigger sample size with that particular group as well.

440
00:58:20,750 --> 00:58:28,080
So if the aim of your study is to understand health disparities in that particular population, you know,

441
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:37,580
you've got to you've got to go outside the city of Vancouver and get this data in a way to do it is that community hospitals,

442
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:46,670
rather than some of the community health centers that they mentioned, a small sample size use of the DEI survey that needed to be validated.

443
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:58,530
So how do you validate the diet survey? So somebody fills out a questionnaire.

444
00:58:58,650 --> 00:59:06,950
Food frequency questionnaire. How do you validate that? You can compare it against.

445
00:59:07,610 --> 00:59:12,710
Time for our wrinkle. Yeah. Again, some other biochemical.

446
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:16,010
Yeah, exactly. So that's the way to do it.

447
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:24,470
You can you can call them up and say, let's go over your food frequency questionnaire and you go within the last 24 hours, what did you consume?

448
00:59:25,310 --> 00:59:29,850
And that's a way to validate that information and then a biomarker.

449
00:59:29,870 --> 00:59:38,140
This is critically important in terms of, okay, your iron intake was this well, let's see what it actually was based on your fair values.

450
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:47,870
Again, if you only have 42% of people who had that value, that, you know, really compromises the conclusions you can make.

451
00:59:48,140 --> 00:59:52,310
But they say that they use ferritin for their diagnosis of anemia.

452
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:59,630
So, yes, hemoglobin the hemoglobin was that the diagnosis inferred and fair.

453
00:59:59,990 --> 01:00:07,250
All right. Well, interesting. Mm hmm. Yeah. So relevance to practice.

454
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:12,530
Dietitians can promote assessment, diagnosis and treatment.

455
01:00:12,710 --> 01:00:22,640
And by establishing protocols with interdisciplinary teams to identify people who have iron deficiency in this population.

456
01:00:23,510 --> 01:00:25,460
So you can do screening for anemia.

457
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:34,459
And this is something that should be done in every visit that somebody has at a medical center, especially people who are on antiretroviral therapy.

458
01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:42,020
They should be followed up very frequently just to make sure that they're not developing anemia.

459
01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:48,350
So and then you can educate people on increasing their iron intake.

460
01:00:48,350 --> 01:00:51,740
And we talked about ways that you can do that. You can take a supplement.

461
01:00:52,010 --> 01:00:57,050
You can cook in iron cooking pans and pots.

462
01:00:57,560 --> 01:00:59,600
And you're you know,

463
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:09,920
you're lucky fish that that iron fish that you can put in different types of liquids and that can cause you to get more iron in your in your food.

464
01:01:10,820 --> 01:01:20,480
And you can increase your intake of vitamin C or vitamin C containing foods when you're consuming,

465
01:01:21,140 --> 01:01:28,640
um, protein are sources of, of iron that can increase your absorption of that particular item.

466
01:01:29,030 --> 01:01:32,599
So if you cook with tomatoes or other acidic types of foods that can increase your

467
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:39,950
absorption and all of these things can be done through education by a dietitian.

468
01:01:41,870 --> 01:01:52,550
So dietitians can also participate in health promotion programs and various settings.

469
01:01:52,910 --> 01:02:04,340
So you can provide information for people who might not know about iron deficiency anemia in this particular population.

470
01:02:04,850 --> 01:02:11,570
How many of you have been involved in health promotion programs where there's a large group of people coming to different events?

471
01:02:11,930 --> 01:02:18,290
How did that go? What was your what was your sense of that? Did you feel that you were educating a group of people,

472
01:02:18,290 --> 01:02:22,550
or did you feel like you were just sitting there and you were bored and just handing out pamphlets,

473
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:31,490
whether it was in Philadelphia and it was held at a food pantry actually, or in some the church that was okay.

474
01:02:32,390 --> 01:02:39,200
And we did like weekly nutrition lessons on different things, mostly for like the older population.

475
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:45,140
Um, and so we did like a lesson and also for the demonstration.

476
01:02:45,590 --> 01:02:49,670
And at the beginning I think a lot of the participants were a little bit skeptical.

477
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:54,350
But if they came to the nutrition class, they would like the incentive that they came to the class.

478
01:02:54,350 --> 01:02:58,130
They would have first opportunity to go into the food pantry.

479
01:02:58,430 --> 01:03:01,970
So I think first people just wanted to go to get in first.

480
01:03:03,140 --> 01:03:09,380
But a lot of the participants did start to form connections with other people in the area.

481
01:03:09,770 --> 01:03:12,800
So I think by the end of it it was said 12 week program.

482
01:03:13,250 --> 01:03:18,770
So by the end of it I think everyone had a good time and learned something good.

483
01:03:19,610 --> 01:03:24,739
And how many people showed up for the the demonstrations consistently?

484
01:03:24,740 --> 01:03:32,629
Probably about 35. Wow. Yeah. So it was it was a pretty big church and also a very large food pantry.

485
01:03:32,630 --> 01:03:37,000
So a lot of people, they get their food from their. Wow.

486
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:42,970
That's really interesting. That's really good. So this is done in an area of Philadelphia that was densely populated as well.

487
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:48,310
Yeah, it was kind of like a little bit out of the city, actually.

488
01:03:49,210 --> 01:03:52,930
But there is a very large population of Asian Americans out here.

489
01:03:52,930 --> 01:03:57,000
Yes. Which which part of the city? West, north or south or.

490
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:00,970
It was like West Valley. Okay. Okay. Which is a.

491
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:11,940
An area that has certain socio economic issues associated with living in that area.

492
01:04:12,110 --> 01:04:16,520
Yeah. You know, I have a brother who lives in Swarthmore.

493
01:04:16,710 --> 01:04:20,150
Oh, yeah. So I'm not familiar with that. But the area a little bit.

494
01:04:23,210 --> 01:04:29,660
So, yeah, health promotion programs, it can increase awareness, provide information,

495
01:04:30,050 --> 01:04:38,720
provide workshops, demonstrations, um, and enhance skills through cooking workshops is what you did.

496
01:04:40,070 --> 01:04:41,880
So what kind of meal prep stuff did you do?

497
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:48,050
What was like the most important thing that you could have shown this group of individuals in through this cooking workshop?

498
01:04:48,450 --> 01:04:53,660
Um, a lot of the things we focused on were based on what was in the pantry.

499
01:04:53,930 --> 01:05:02,240
So obviously the inventory team. Yes. And the providers at that they came through with like let us know kind of like what they have the most stuff.

500
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:09,230
And so we kind of tailor our recipes to their ingredients.

501
01:05:09,980 --> 01:05:16,549
Um, yeah, we focus on a lot about just adding like easy ways to like,

502
01:05:16,550 --> 01:05:24,230
add fruits and vegetables and other things like increased sodium because people are older and a lot of them did have like chronic conditions.

503
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:32,510
So yeah. Did you have your food pantry had fruits and vegetables available?

504
01:05:32,780 --> 01:05:34,729
Yeah. Which are they? Yeah.

505
01:05:34,730 --> 01:05:46,080
They actually received very large quantities from grocery stores in the area and they had some kind of connection with another provider.

506
01:05:46,100 --> 01:05:49,550
But every week, there's a lot of fresh fruits and vegetables. Well, that's great.

507
01:05:51,620 --> 01:06:02,090
I worked at a food pantry when I was in graduate school for four or five years and go about 4 hours a month and sometimes more,

508
01:06:02,210 --> 01:06:09,980
depending on if people could fill in or not. If they couldn't, we wouldn't end up going and we didn't have any fruits and vegetables.

509
01:06:10,910 --> 01:06:19,580
It was all canned or dried goods and occasionally we would get frozen meat and bread and those like we would keep that in the freezer.

510
01:06:19,580 --> 01:06:25,340
And it was mostly white bread and people said, don't give me any of that diet bread, just which was the whole wheat bread.

511
01:06:25,340 --> 01:06:32,360
Right. They didn't want it. And boy, that was a a powerful lesson there too.

512
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:40,879
Um, learning about people with food insecurity from my stand point and then the different kinds of people that came in,

513
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:45,050
we had our regulars and then we had people who you would see and then you would never see again.

514
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:53,720
But it was eye opening in terms of seeing food insecurity up close, in terms of what kind of issues people are facing.

515
01:06:55,470 --> 01:07:03,900
All right. So I think that's it. And then, you know, these are some of the things that we've mentioned or reduce social barriers to food insecurity.

516
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:09,690
And yeah. So with the entire restaurant hiring guidelines.

517
01:07:10,050 --> 01:07:13,870
Yes, I do. Have there been reports of drug.

518
01:07:15,910 --> 01:07:22,390
So there are there are some individuals who are most into people who respond.

519
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:31,470
But there are there's a subgroup of individuals who, for whatever reason, there is problems with intolerance.

520
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:40,570
And I don't remember the details. But yes, this is that these are the people who their disease might progress because of this intolerance.

521
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:49,240
But we're just trying to find out if this is something that they have to take for the rest of their lives.

522
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:54,830
Do they start a moment like a very low dosage then? Do they have to increase it as time goes on?

523
01:07:54,850 --> 01:08:02,320
Because they can to it. Because if you stop and you still have to do it and somewhere that you still have the risk of developing.

524
01:08:02,350 --> 01:08:09,940
Yeah, I think, you know, I don't know that level of detail, but I do know that the some of the intolerance may be due to some side effects.

525
01:08:09,940 --> 01:08:15,160
And I can't remember what those are. And that's what would force somebody off of the treatment protocol.

526
01:08:16,090 --> 01:08:18,070
And I don't know what's done.

527
01:08:18,100 --> 01:08:26,919
I do know that most of the drugs that are used to treat it are off patent and very affordable and are being actually in Africa.

528
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:31,060
They're being administered for free in many cases.

529
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:37,240
And so that one of the good things the pharmaceutical industry did was to

530
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:41,049
provide these types of drugs for people living in sub-Saharan Africa at a very,

531
01:08:41,050 --> 01:08:47,410
very low cost where everybody can afford it. So that's all I have for today.

532
01:08:47,620 --> 01:08:52,420
Then the next time we meet, we'll have our start with our student presentations.

533
01:08:52,780 --> 01:09:12,290
Okay. All right. So.

534
01:09:12,610 --> 01:09:12,930
I mean.
