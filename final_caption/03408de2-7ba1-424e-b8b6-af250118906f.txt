1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:06,300
Today we're going to be talking about age creating cohort models.

2
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:13,950
Before we dove into that, I just want to canvas for a second.

3
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:21,450
Sorry, I didn't realize I hadn't gotten this up until this morning, but the campus page for this week is now available.

4
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,670
And this week we're going to be describing trends in longitudinal data,

5
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:36,360
sort of epidemiological time series that have information by age over time and described as being in a cohort.

6
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:41,950
I'm going to visualize these epidemiological time series and use these corporate

7
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:46,560
models to evaluate these trends specifically and then visualize the model.

8
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:48,870
So that's the goal for this week.

9
00:00:49,690 --> 00:01:00,660
And I included both the sort of technical reading and two example readings which are optional in the lecture and that are there in terms of timing.

10
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:07,800
I mentioned last week that next week we're going to be in the computer lab both days and they're both going to be work days.

11
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,050
And I also wanted to review assignment due dates.

12
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:19,710
So Lab four is going to be due on Monday.

13
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:32,730
Lab five Join Point is going to be due on Wednesday, although I might extend that Friday and Lab six will be due on the 21st.

14
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:36,210
So that's the material that we're starting today.

15
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:43,520
After fall break, we'll start with cancer survival and week seven.

16
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:51,730
So I know we're a little bit behind in lab versus the lecture and we may have another catch up day at some point, but kind of play it by ear.

17
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:59,420
Any questions about before anything back and forth get started?

18
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:08,090
If not, we'll dove right in. This is probably my favorite topic of this class age period for girls.

19
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:15,110
Um, and the goal is to think about epidemiological time series.

20
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:24,200
And this could be things like assessing the temporal trends or evolution in disease rates, and that can be things like incidence,

21
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:30,770
mortality, prevalence, other metrics that are relevant to public health, not just cancer.

22
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:41,300
Um, we get this allows for comparison between relative groups and how these affect are other time

23
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:46,880
series and it's understanding how sort of specific events in time may be related to that.

24
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:56,040
Um. We can also think about a sort of ecological analysis of the impact of public health interventions on disease outcome,

25
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:59,180
how those are impacting the population.

26
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:05,300
And these can also be a real source of hypotheses and ideas for testing,

27
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:16,010
modeling projections, so forth, and so particularly in longer duration time series.

28
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:29,959
It's often helpful to think about three different ways in which time impacts risk, and the first way is the most helpful age being one's current age.

29
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:40,130
How long you've lived? And age effects, when we think about them, are affecting everyone at the same age and may reflect age specific factors.

30
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:47,990
So we all age biologically and that can be things like accumulation of stress there, things like puberty,

31
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:54,680
menopause that kind of happen at different times over the life course, but really kind of thinking from a life course perspective.

32
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:59,830
Next is period, which is the current year.

33
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:08,110
And so things that that are period effects or calendar year effects are things that happen at a specific time.

34
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:17,320
And so from an epidemiological perspective that may reflect things like new treatments that are changing, so particularly in the cancer perspective,

35
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:27,760
as, for example, immunological based treatments have come around the last couple of years, you may see those affecting cancer survival, for example.

36
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:35,680
But sort of more broadly, you can think about things like war or economic crisis impacting other things.

37
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,940
Or we saw in the tobacco control specific regulations,

38
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:51,010
the more subtle but often more important is the cohort or birth cohort effects which have to do with the year of your birth.

39
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,660
So thinking about everyone who is born around the same time, basically this is a bit generational perspective.

40
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:09,070
And so, you know, we talk about the silent generation and the baby boomers, Gen X, generalized Gen Z, millennials and Zoomers.

41
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:18,340
Then we can think about how for that cohort, things like social attitudes have changed for something like a sexually transmitted infection,

42
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:32,080
sexual mores, basically mores around smoking, for example, and just sort of overall quality of living can all affect the cohort trends.

43
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:47,730
Yeah. Happy data stories. So I want us to take a little bit of time to brainstorm some possible things that could have an age period or cohort effect.

44
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:53,550
So take a couple of minutes to chat with your neighbors and then we'll write them down.

45
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:23,638
I have two different. Vertical facial fibers, for example, there's an interesting book.

46
00:06:24,903 --> 00:06:31,023
Okay. So I'm hearing lots of good discussion. Let's come back as a group to think through them.

47
00:06:31,383 --> 00:06:35,883
So I first going to just ask each group, for example, of one of each.

48
00:06:36,273 --> 00:06:44,643
And then we'll come back and see if there are more than we want to talk about. So, Lauren and Emily, what age the fact that you came up with.

49
00:06:46,913 --> 00:06:51,303
We are a little confused on the difference between like age and cohort.

50
00:06:51,323 --> 00:06:58,943
Okay. We started the our first the first thing that we discussed was the pandemic and how that could have occurred.

51
00:06:58,943 --> 00:07:03,683
That was a period where it could have affected people. Okay. So yeah.

52
00:07:03,953 --> 00:07:07,192
And then we were kind of then getting a little confused,

53
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:11,213
thinking about the difference between like there's a cohort of people that were born into the pandemic.

54
00:07:11,603 --> 00:07:16,613
And so I'm wondering if that could possibly affect their outcomes like later in life.

55
00:07:16,613 --> 00:07:25,493
And that's something we're not sure about. And then now if we're confused, we can tie that back to the age.

56
00:07:26,873 --> 00:07:31,763
Yeah, absolutely. Sorry.

57
00:07:31,773 --> 00:07:34,033
No, that's not the answer. No, I think that's good.

58
00:07:34,323 --> 00:07:44,402
I actually really like that example because it gets at this subtlety and sort of seeing an effect and being like,

59
00:07:44,403 --> 00:07:49,143
well, do I attribute this, you know, thing that happened?

60
00:07:49,473 --> 00:07:54,453
Is it true that it happened for everyone in these couple of years?

61
00:07:54,903 --> 00:08:01,533
Or is it for the birth cohorts who were specifically born in these years?

62
00:08:02,043 --> 00:08:10,123
You know, and so that there's this kind of subtlety in that we're going to get to in a couple of slides of the interaction between endemic and age.

63
00:08:10,163 --> 00:08:13,053
It's not always clear which is the right way to interpret it.

64
00:08:14,043 --> 00:08:22,773
But the way that I would that we want to think about it is a period of is going to affect all ages in this time period,

65
00:08:23,673 --> 00:08:31,743
whereas a cohort effect is specifically these years in which people are born and following that across their entire lives.

66
00:08:32,013 --> 00:08:35,403
So would a pandemic not be considered work either?

67
00:08:35,463 --> 00:08:39,003
Also affected people that weren't born when it occurred?

68
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:51,963
So I would think of the cohort effect around the pandemic as like like pre pandemic versus post pandemic birth happens to be

69
00:08:51,963 --> 00:09:01,443
like the pandemic really changed how we deal with mental health and that's like we had better mental health and post-pandemic,

70
00:09:03,153 --> 00:09:09,023
better mental health services, post-pandemic. And that's like, you know, things have changed because of that.

71
00:09:09,033 --> 00:09:15,392
That's a really optimistic view. But but that's the kind of thing that I might expect it could offset.

72
00:09:15,393 --> 00:09:19,803
I think what you're getting at, though, is kind of like the babies they were born during the pandemic,

73
00:09:19,803 --> 00:09:25,262
had a very specific issue and very specific issues around like what it's like

74
00:09:25,263 --> 00:09:31,003
to be in a hospital or like higher or lower chances of hospital infections or.

75
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:40,383
But but something like the setback in education is probably a more of a period effect.

76
00:09:40,683 --> 00:09:44,613
Yeah, but at the same time, there's probably kind of an interaction that,

77
00:09:44,763 --> 00:09:51,383
that period of fact is mediated by your age because certain ages are going to bounce back from that better than others.

78
00:09:51,423 --> 00:09:56,793
So there is, again, that subtlety. Um, let's see.

79
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:04,223
That is the group in the back. Tell me age period or cohort effect?

80
00:10:06,953 --> 00:10:13,553
So one of the possible things that we talk about is an economic stimulus.

81
00:10:14,123 --> 00:10:20,753
Okay. For example, student loan forgiveness and how that will have an impact on.

82
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:29,502
Individuals should ensure the introduction of the new policy announced that affecting health

83
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:37,453
outcomes affecting if those who will not directly but it's like the social determinants of health.

84
00:10:37,633 --> 00:10:45,883
Sure. So downstream like economic impacts improve?

85
00:10:47,183 --> 00:10:54,853
Yes. It could also, if people have more disposable income now that they're not paying off loans, they seek out more help.

86
00:10:55,183 --> 00:11:02,983
Okay. Disposable income for neglected.

87
00:11:05,593 --> 00:11:11,072
Health experts. That procedures, that kind of thing.

88
00:11:11,073 --> 00:11:17,763
So all of a sudden people are like, Oh, time to go to the dentist for the first time now that I have my, um, great.

89
00:11:18,043 --> 00:11:22,053
Um, sure. She and Erin, do you have something you'd like to share?

90
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:28,833
Oh, yeah. I think we talk about also the path of law and policies.

91
00:11:29,643 --> 00:11:34,463
That was the screening program. Okay, I'll have that.

92
00:11:35,013 --> 00:11:41,213
I'm not sure. And so do you think that's an age period or cohort effect period?

93
00:11:41,663 --> 00:11:46,013
Probably a period effect for changes in screening guidelines.

94
00:11:52,193 --> 00:12:02,003
And actually that makes it very challenging to analyze some types of cancers like prostate, breast, cervical,

95
00:12:02,213 --> 00:12:08,233
because incidence of these depends very much on screening and the screening changes over the years.

96
00:12:08,243 --> 00:12:12,173
It's very hard to understand whether incidence is actually changing. So that's a good one.

97
00:12:13,883 --> 00:12:17,032
Did anyone have any age effects yet?

98
00:12:17,033 --> 00:12:20,783
So they might have age effects. They'd like to share biology as your body.

99
00:12:22,073 --> 00:12:25,283
Sure. That's sort of aging.

100
00:12:25,553 --> 00:12:29,183
Aging biology. So we talked about like.

101
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:34,193
Puberty and menopause.

102
00:12:35,903 --> 00:12:43,263
Just a accumulation. What?

103
00:12:44,293 --> 00:12:51,973
So cancer potential, it's kind of vague. But, you know, the the idea of like DNA damage, I mean, that's a better way of saying that.

104
00:12:55,353 --> 00:13:00,773
Oh, I don't have any other specific examples of aging.

105
00:13:01,263 --> 00:13:04,623
Yeah, maybe I. Okay.

106
00:13:04,703 --> 00:13:08,223
That's great access to, uh.

107
00:13:08,423 --> 00:13:09,953
Let's just say, like.

108
00:13:11,393 --> 00:13:22,843
Government services and because those contents change over time and they may be different for the US versus other other groups, they're great.

109
00:13:22,853 --> 00:13:26,033
That's great that the non-biological one tried to have that.

110
00:13:27,023 --> 00:13:31,583
Yeah. And screening also be in effect as in like the screenings only recommended for certain ages.

111
00:13:31,973 --> 00:13:48,433
Yeah. We have another cohort one.

112
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:57,393
Like smoking additives and and other substance use.

113
00:13:59,853 --> 00:14:08,763
And early life infectious disease exposures great currently life exposures.

114
00:14:09,213 --> 00:14:19,532
So influenza but also things like pylori which really affects your stomach cancer risk or this is

115
00:14:19,533 --> 00:14:24,002
another one where we kind of have like an overlap as we talked about like more time for the period.

116
00:14:24,003 --> 00:14:27,513
But it would be like the cohort that was born in the years where they actually fought

117
00:14:27,963 --> 00:14:32,943
in a war and were exposed to like potentially toxic chemicals or like PTSD like.

118
00:14:33,393 --> 00:14:37,263
So it's kind of like that cohort in that specific period.

119
00:14:37,503 --> 00:14:48,093
Yeah. So, so I think war against both a like the pandemic, both a period and COVID effects because you have the people that are affected by it,

120
00:14:48,093 --> 00:14:51,573
I don't know, let's say something like nutrition shortages during the war,

121
00:14:52,443 --> 00:14:58,233
but the people that were actually are like deployable age during the war may have had higher,

122
00:14:58,893 --> 00:15:03,543
you know, exposures to like napalm in the Vietnam War or other chemicals potentially.

123
00:15:03,753 --> 00:15:07,923
So. But you can definitely see ways in which war could be out there.

124
00:15:09,753 --> 00:15:16,213
Any last ones anyone want to to share? Okay.

125
00:15:16,253 --> 00:15:16,963
These are great.

126
00:15:16,993 --> 00:15:25,333
Hopefully this gives you a little bit more of a sense of how we're thinking about the different effects and how we're kind of decomposing them,

127
00:15:26,623 --> 00:15:30,613
and also how that there's some sort of subtlety and nuance here.

128
00:15:30,943 --> 00:15:38,203
So one of the things that we were sort of beginning to notice is that they're not actually separate.

129
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:41,922
Right? Age is given by period minus birth cohort.

130
00:15:41,923 --> 00:15:44,473
And so they're not separable.

131
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:55,453
You can always look at all these separately if you had a table and age and here you can always look along the diagonal to understand birth cohorts.

132
00:15:56,623 --> 00:16:04,603
And so the traditional way of visualizing each growing cohort data are less diagrams.

133
00:16:04,903 --> 00:16:18,533
So this is kind of the classic way. So you can imagine looking at like three individuals here that were born in 1910, 1915, 1920.

134
00:16:18,793 --> 00:16:26,203
And you can sort of follow them as they age across time and place as they died at three points.

135
00:16:27,703 --> 00:16:33,133
Here on the right, we have total U.S. population by age and calendar period.

136
00:16:34,513 --> 00:16:42,823
And so you can say for any point, how many ten year olds were there in 1940, how many 50 year old through there in 1980?

137
00:16:44,263 --> 00:16:48,492
And what you can see is that we do that.

138
00:16:48,493 --> 00:16:51,553
A lot of the effects here are diagonal.

139
00:16:52,123 --> 00:16:59,653
Right. And so these diagonal effects are actually related to how that one cohort is aging.

140
00:17:00,403 --> 00:17:05,923
And so we have this very high cohort here in the late, late 1940s.

141
00:17:06,163 --> 00:17:11,443
So here are baby boomers that we actually see as they progress sort of through time.

142
00:17:13,343 --> 00:17:19,783
Um, and so when we look at Alexa's diagram, pure age effects are going to look horizontal,

143
00:17:20,173 --> 00:17:24,733
pure period effects vertical and a few cohort effects as diagonals.

144
00:17:26,483 --> 00:17:28,063
This, like I said, is the passageway.

145
00:17:28,393 --> 00:17:40,303
There is actually a very recent trend towards using what are called hexa maps, and these were actually developed around 2020.

146
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:46,573
And they're an alternative to the Lexus diagram. You'll still see Lexus diagrams and they're still, of course, taught.

147
00:17:46,813 --> 00:17:52,433
But I really like to promote the Hexa Map as a way of visualizing each period.

148
00:17:52,723 --> 00:17:57,943
And the reason that they're nice is that they're actually giving age period or equal visual weight.

149
00:17:58,813 --> 00:18:07,563
In the previous Lexus diagram. Age and year are primary and you have to kind of understand cohort by looking at the diagonal and the hexagon

150
00:18:07,563 --> 00:18:15,793
and we have this think they're each on their own one of three axes and we give them equal weight in this way.

151
00:18:16,093 --> 00:18:24,673
And so we can look at birth cohorts in this axis periods in this axis and features and the third axis.

152
00:18:27,443 --> 00:18:31,613
And so I created some hexum maps for us to look at for lung cancer.

153
00:18:32,543 --> 00:18:37,343
And I want to just take a couple of minutes to kind of really disentangle what's going on here.

154
00:18:37,973 --> 00:18:41,783
So the ages, are these diagonals coming up like this.

155
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:50,723
So you can see that there's not much cancer incidence up to the ages here, but probably around 30, 35.

156
00:18:51,083 --> 00:19:02,483
And it's very low start. It's really starting to increase around 65, probably in the highest incidence at the oldest ages, close to 85 over time.

157
00:19:02,903 --> 00:19:06,773
Which are the verticals, we don't actually see very much difference.

158
00:19:06,773 --> 00:19:14,902
Right. Each vertical slice looks about the same and then the cohorts are the other diagonals.

159
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:22,403
And we can say we take one slice that's a cohort. And so in our data when actually we saw this in Lab one, if you remember,

160
00:19:22,553 --> 00:19:28,933
we have very different age ranges for this cohort as opposed to this cohort down here.

161
00:19:28,943 --> 00:19:32,873
And so that's something we have to take into account in our data.

162
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:45,983
We the strongest effects here are very clearly by age, but there are some other sort of shapes forming that are worth investigating.

163
00:19:46,223 --> 00:19:52,043
We actually see that shape a little bit more clearly for women here on the right where we have kind of this rounding effect.

164
00:19:52,883 --> 00:20:01,043
And we'll probably want to investigate whether that's a period effect as we move this way or a cohort effect as we put this.

165
00:20:03,473 --> 00:20:07,793
Any questions about interpreting the hexamer? Yes.

166
00:20:08,003 --> 00:20:11,653
Could you explain the. Like how you visualize.

167
00:20:12,733 --> 00:20:22,123
Yeah. So the court is any thing along this, um, sort of lower left, upper right diagonal.

168
00:20:22,453 --> 00:20:25,613
So the cohort in 1987. Um.

169
00:20:27,963 --> 00:20:31,022
So. That's right. I see.

170
00:20:31,023 --> 00:20:34,923
Oh, this actually you say the reason is that I started age 39, age zero.

171
00:20:35,433 --> 00:20:44,643
So in 1987, someone that's age 30 is going to be aged 30 and 2017.

172
00:20:45,243 --> 00:20:55,203
Right. So we so we only have a single point in which we have data for them as opposed to the cohort in 1991.

173
00:20:57,513 --> 00:21:06,313
They only show up in our dataset, which begins in 1975 at age 85 or 84, something like that.

174
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:15,873
And so how much data really depends until we rank cohort is a bit of a funny one because it kind of goes around this cake and the graph.

175
00:21:18,303 --> 00:21:24,873
Often I like to draw lines.

176
00:21:28,143 --> 00:21:32,343
On the grass so that I can say.

177
00:21:34,573 --> 00:21:39,523
Look at this age effect here.

178
00:21:40,393 --> 00:21:52,263
If there was a period of fact, it would look like. That's for example, that's a better color here.

179
00:22:04,763 --> 00:22:11,143
And if I had a cohort effect. It'll look something like.

180
00:22:15,523 --> 00:22:24,853
Yes. And so we would expect, as we move this way, to see changes as opposed to like this cynical bit more sense.

181
00:22:28,183 --> 00:22:38,223
Other questions. Okay.

182
00:22:38,303 --> 00:22:48,893
And so one of the things that we often first, due to diagnose what the trends even are, is to look at similar to what we did in Lab one.

183
00:22:50,603 --> 00:23:02,003
In this case of four incidents, incidents by eight specific incidents grouped by cohort on the left or by period on the right.

184
00:23:02,873 --> 00:23:12,143
So here we have the birth cohort of 1900, 1905, 1910, 1915, 1920, and so on.

185
00:23:12,743 --> 00:23:15,953
Again, 1900 years, 1910, 1920.

186
00:23:16,643 --> 00:23:21,833
And as you recall, we only have for the earliest cohorts a little bit at the end ages.

187
00:23:22,133 --> 00:23:24,953
And for the most recent cohorts, we only have a little bit at the beginning.

188
00:23:25,703 --> 00:23:30,263
And so they don't offer as much of us as much information on the overall specific trends.

189
00:23:32,393 --> 00:23:41,393
But when we look by period here on the right, we get everybody along different years.

190
00:23:41,693 --> 00:23:48,113
So you can kind of think that these are the same people who are falling over time, and each of these lines is completely different people.

191
00:23:49,103 --> 00:23:57,473
And so we can look at how these these curves have really increased for women from 1975 up through 2005 to 15.

192
00:23:59,033 --> 00:24:05,003
And we would like to diagnose whether these changes that we're seeing are by period or by.

193
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:19,763
What I said and the way that we start to think about this from a quantitative statistical perspective is what we call the age period cover model.

194
00:24:20,573 --> 00:24:24,713
And we're going to look at that and we're going to think about the standard APC model, which works on incidence.

195
00:24:25,073 --> 00:24:33,833
There are others in other generalizations, but our standard assumption is to assume that age period and cohort effects are multiplicative.

196
00:24:35,723 --> 00:24:43,973
And so the incidence is some number of people at risk at some age period.

197
00:24:43,973 --> 00:24:52,703
And cohort time is a baseline incidence rate that gets impacted by age effect, a period of fact and a cohort.

198
00:24:54,053 --> 00:25:09,063
It's pretty straightforward, at least in theory. And so the way that we often think about this is to define an incidence rate.

199
00:25:09,183 --> 00:25:13,413
So again, incidence is being number, incidence rate is the rate per population.

200
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:23,613
And so if I decide the incidence rates as lambda, then I can get that by incidence number, incidence divided by number of population.

201
00:25:23,943 --> 00:25:30,723
And that leaves you with that base rate times the age effect, times the period of times the cohort effect.

202
00:25:32,193 --> 00:25:37,953
And this is convenient because we like because we like linear models.

203
00:25:38,283 --> 00:25:47,823
It's convenient to take the log of this. So that log of lambda is now some, some additive function of a baseline rate.

204
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:55,773
In age of fact, a period of vaccine appropriate effect when these are logs of the underlying effects.

205
00:25:57,573 --> 00:26:08,463
So now we just have open enrollment. But a question is how do we specify the functions, these beta functions?

206
00:26:10,773 --> 00:26:14,373
Normally, if you were just doing linear regression, we would just like get a single value.

207
00:26:15,243 --> 00:26:24,393
But we don't necessarily want them to be actually linear because, uh, a good example of this.

208
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:32,403
Let's go back here. Um, this age cohort effect is clearly not linear, right?

209
00:26:32,433 --> 00:26:38,553
It goes up and it goes down over time. And so we don't want to just be like birth is increasing back over linearly.

210
00:26:38,643 --> 00:26:46,053
That's now. That's not what's happening. So we need to be able to specify other shapes for our effects.

211
00:26:46,923 --> 00:26:56,763
And one, basically the default often is a step function every single year or every single age gets a different value.

212
00:26:58,683 --> 00:27:03,273
And this is it is good, particularly if you have on off effects.

213
00:27:03,393 --> 00:27:06,903
So if you're thinking about war time or thinking about pandemic,

214
00:27:07,473 --> 00:27:12,783
it's either like there's no pandemic and there is a pandemic and then there's no pandemic, roughly speaking.

215
00:27:13,953 --> 00:27:17,223
And so this kind of step function can be helpful.

216
00:27:18,243 --> 00:27:28,322
Alternatively, there may be randomness in the effects if you're doing something like what flu strain circulated each year, is it H one and one?

217
00:27:28,323 --> 00:27:38,403
Or is H3N2 while that is going to be random each year, we're not necessarily random, but it's it can be either or or both of them.

218
00:27:40,343 --> 00:27:44,393
With challenging about step functions is that particularly for large data sets,

219
00:27:44,693 --> 00:27:54,173
you have a lot of parameters to estimate and they don't necessarily represent continuous effects well because a lot of the effects,

220
00:27:54,443 --> 00:28:01,703
particularly things on cohort, because they're changing societies changing slowly over time you really have you would expect

221
00:28:01,703 --> 00:28:09,533
there to be continuous changes in the effect of birth cohort on cancer incidence for example.

222
00:28:09,923 --> 00:28:17,153
And so especially for smaller data sets, step functions can kind of leap around a bit and don't represent continuous function as well.

223
00:28:19,013 --> 00:28:23,393
An alternative are something called skylines.

224
00:28:23,933 --> 00:28:34,163
So who is it encountered before at least some of us will work with finds that next week or the next lecture as well.

225
00:28:34,603 --> 00:28:46,523
It's lines are piecewise continuous polynomials, so they're similar to joint points in that in the joint functions we did piecewise linear functions.

226
00:28:47,213 --> 00:28:51,723
These are piecewise polynomial functions. Okay.

227
00:28:53,193 --> 00:28:57,963
And because they're piecewise continuous polynomials, they're continuous,

228
00:28:58,323 --> 00:29:02,793
which is nice because all of the effects that we're trying to estimate are continuous.

229
00:29:03,303 --> 00:29:06,483
And so if we want continuous events, swines are a great choice.

230
00:29:08,193 --> 00:29:15,303
They're tend to be fairly parsimonious in the sense that we don't need that many parameters to specify them.

231
00:29:16,653 --> 00:29:24,813
And they tend to be a little bit better behaved down like really high degree males because you don't necessarily need a high degree of polynomial.

232
00:29:24,933 --> 00:29:34,773
You don't need a temporary polynomial when any individual effect is only like cubic at most, and any time period it's cubic at most.

233
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:40,913
And so having a piecewise keeping it makes a lot more sense than trying to estimate a temporary polynomial over a longer period.

234
00:29:43,253 --> 00:29:46,823
Challenges here include that spines are not always easy to work with.

235
00:29:48,083 --> 00:29:54,293
Some clear how to assign the points at which you're sort of switching from polynomial to not every focus not.

236
00:29:55,973 --> 00:29:59,203
Although one rule of thumb is to use one.

237
00:29:59,213 --> 00:30:10,263
Not for ten years. I actually cannot remember how much spines I put in the lab, but if are there will work for them to get there.

238
00:30:13,233 --> 00:30:18,633
Another challenge of working with the APC models is that they are not identifiable.

239
00:30:19,443 --> 00:30:28,163
The estimates that you get for the values in the model are not unique and that's because of this interest.

240
00:30:28,443 --> 00:30:33,183
The relationship between cohort and period, the cohort is period minus age.

241
00:30:33,573 --> 00:30:43,563
So if we look at our function, it's incidence a function of age period and cohort if we rank cohort is period minus age when as a function of age,

242
00:30:43,833 --> 00:30:55,203
period and period of minus age. And if you were to run right up here, your model matrix, the columns of your model matrix are not independent anymore.

243
00:30:55,833 --> 00:30:59,123
And if they're not independent, then you don't have an identifiable model.

244
00:31:01,403 --> 00:31:07,133
So what do we do about that? So there are two basic approaches for dealing with this issue.

245
00:31:07,643 --> 00:31:15,503
The first one, which is the one that I favor, is to compare the models, each using only two effects.

246
00:31:17,303 --> 00:31:23,513
Typically, we're going to include age because age almost always affects, especially for cancer risk.

247
00:31:24,503 --> 00:31:30,713
And so you would specify the model that has age and period, but not cohort without an age period model.

248
00:31:31,073 --> 00:31:37,613
And the model that has the aging cohort that up here in the age cohort model and you say which of these fits better,

249
00:31:38,153 --> 00:31:42,473
which is sort of better, explains the data.

250
00:31:43,493 --> 00:31:47,303
An alternative is to add a constraint in the model.

251
00:31:47,693 --> 00:31:51,473
Usually that's to say that the cohort a period effects have to be zero and average.

252
00:31:51,893 --> 00:31:57,083
That's enough of a constraint that you can get what you need to get.

253
00:31:57,683 --> 00:32:06,142
Alternatively, and I think we'll see this later in the semester, you can put a constraint on like the shape of age.

254
00:32:06,143 --> 00:32:15,083
So what will do well in the semester is say like there's a biologically reasonable shape to cancer incidence over time or over age.

255
00:32:16,193 --> 00:32:23,513
And so if we fix our shapes to be to have those shapes, then period cohort become identifiable.

256
00:32:23,993 --> 00:32:25,643
But we'll get to that later in the semester.

257
00:32:27,593 --> 00:32:34,973
But I don't love about this constraint approach, though, that it can make the estimates sometimes difficult to interpret.

258
00:32:37,323 --> 00:32:47,193
Okay. So back to this question. Are the trends that we're seeing in lung cancer incidence in metro women period or covering things?

259
00:32:48,343 --> 00:32:52,183
Right. So let's think about what we're what we're saying here.

260
00:32:52,963 --> 00:32:58,863
We're saying that, yes, even the fighting would be identifiable.

261
00:32:59,433 --> 00:33:08,653
Yeah. So identifiable means that the parameter estimates are uniquely associated with the data, given the model.

262
00:33:09,283 --> 00:33:17,243
So that. If you can, let's say.

263
00:33:19,493 --> 00:33:37,803
She's here. So ip1 times age plus p two times period plus p three times cohort and I rewrite

264
00:33:37,803 --> 00:33:47,223
this as you want a two times period plus three times a period minus age.

265
00:33:47,883 --> 00:34:00,663
All of a sudden this becomes the P one minus three times age plus two plus p three times period.

266
00:34:02,733 --> 00:34:05,823
P one minus p three should be identifiable.

267
00:34:06,493 --> 00:34:14,553
It like if we think of this as being a linear model and we observe age and period and identify this similarity to identify P2 plus P three.

268
00:34:15,993 --> 00:34:18,813
But that's two pieces of information for three parameters.

269
00:34:19,953 --> 00:34:25,442
So based on a value of P three, we would get P1 to be two, but we don't have enough information.

270
00:34:25,443 --> 00:34:34,953
So these individually are not at the individual age cohort and period of X are not identifiable.

271
00:34:35,643 --> 00:34:41,253
We can identify their effect on the data collectively.

272
00:34:41,643 --> 00:34:45,423
That's what's going on here. But we can separately separate them.

273
00:34:46,413 --> 00:34:56,753
So make sense. So identify ability means the ability to make unique estimates of the parameters.

274
00:35:02,693 --> 00:35:09,773
Okay. So back to this question. Are the trends that we're seeing here pure takeover effects?

275
00:35:10,433 --> 00:35:18,683
Well, in our model, we are saying that log of incidents rate is additive.

276
00:35:20,893 --> 00:35:29,293
And so we would expect. The log of incidents to be parallel to each other.

277
00:35:31,243 --> 00:35:38,443
So that basically for a different period effect, you're just going to sort of translate the whole thing up or down, just up or down.

278
00:35:40,423 --> 00:35:50,562
And we can start to see that one set or the other looks a little bit more like the

279
00:35:50,563 --> 00:35:58,033
lines could be just vertically translated and there's the left to the right level.

280
00:35:58,033 --> 00:36:01,192
More like it's a vertical translation than the other two.

281
00:36:01,193 --> 00:36:06,763
You. It's not, like, perfectly obvious.

282
00:36:06,973 --> 00:36:12,283
I'll grant you that. But one of them, I think, does look a little bit better.

283
00:36:15,903 --> 00:36:18,363
Yeah. Left on the left. That's right.

284
00:36:18,373 --> 00:36:25,653
And so these are basically kind of just like I can just imagine kind of switching them all up and they'll all kind of be the same line.

285
00:36:26,673 --> 00:36:30,843
Whereas these you're going to get like they bend differently.

286
00:36:31,563 --> 00:36:35,223
And so you can't just kind of like move them and get them on top of each other.

287
00:36:37,323 --> 00:36:40,383
If you move them, these are all kind of crossing.

288
00:36:42,573 --> 00:36:49,563
It's so it's it's less likely just by visual inspection that it's a period rather than a cohort effect.

289
00:36:51,713 --> 00:36:54,833
And so. Right. So the question, which is parallel on the log scale.

290
00:36:57,733 --> 00:37:05,023
The way that we're going to do that to cover models in this class is using the AP package.

291
00:37:06,403 --> 00:37:11,833
So I, I like the think package in that it kind of makes this easier.

292
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:15,972
They do kind of science and stuff behind the scenes.

293
00:37:15,973 --> 00:37:24,523
And so this is not what I used for my own research. I like to do it by hand and I'm happy to talk to anyone who's interested how to do this.

294
00:37:24,793 --> 00:37:31,873
A little more flexibility. But the package is a nice way to kind of plug and play each pair of cover models.

295
00:37:32,503 --> 00:37:40,183
And so here I've shown an age career cohort model analysis using the AP package for lung cancer.

296
00:37:40,703 --> 00:37:47,833
And so what it's doing is it's, it's saying I'm going to fit an age model in a fit of age drift model.

297
00:37:48,193 --> 00:37:52,332
Even talked about drift. I don't really use it much for anything.

298
00:37:52,333 --> 00:37:55,392
It's more of a sort of technical concept, really.

299
00:37:55,393 --> 00:37:59,983
It's any variation that could be equally well described by period or cohort.

300
00:38:01,243 --> 00:38:04,963
And so the sense of like the pandemic, is it a period effect,

301
00:38:04,963 --> 00:38:10,603
is it a cohort effect that kind of gets wrapped up into this idea of drift that we can't really tell the difference?

302
00:38:11,323 --> 00:38:22,393
This often happens, particularly in smaller data sets where the like there's just not enough time range for you to really be able to distinguish.

303
00:38:23,263 --> 00:38:26,803
So we're not going to work with that. But just so that, you know, when it pops up.

304
00:38:27,343 --> 00:38:34,273
So if I take age model drift, I specify not drift, but cohort I do age period.

305
00:38:34,273 --> 00:38:37,723
In cohort I would have to work just to age period.

306
00:38:38,323 --> 00:38:48,853
And I go to each drift on the other side. And so we're really going to focus on comparing the age cohort each period and each period cohort models.

307
00:38:52,803 --> 00:39:01,233
And we've talked a little bit about the information criterion before, but the AIC here refers to the information criterion,

308
00:39:01,803 --> 00:39:09,603
which is defined as two times the negative one likelihood, which is the measure of fit and two times the number of parameters.

309
00:39:10,293 --> 00:39:18,333
And so the information criterion is combining a penalty on bad fit with the penalty on overfitting.

310
00:39:19,473 --> 00:39:27,153
And so this gives us a way to say what is the quote unquote best fit model.

311
00:39:28,203 --> 00:39:32,363
That's a reasonable thing, although I kind of like to think about it as being.

312
00:39:32,393 --> 00:39:38,193
And so we're not just throwing so many parameters at it that we can easily fit the data.

313
00:39:38,613 --> 00:39:47,013
So what that might mean, for example, is you say, well, I'm going to use a step function and get every single cohort a different value.

314
00:39:47,313 --> 00:39:51,853
And it can like kind of go jump around all over the place and fit the data really well.

315
00:39:52,683 --> 00:39:55,763
But mechanistically, it's probably actually continuous.

316
00:39:55,773 --> 00:40:00,933
And so we've really just over fit the data by letting it jump around a lot with a lot of parameters.

317
00:40:02,303 --> 00:40:08,723
And so the information criteria is a good way to assess which of the models is getting better.

318
00:40:09,203 --> 00:40:24,293
So if I highlight this is just an inset by highlight, the model I see and I look at my age cohort model and get 18 227 versus 24,455.

319
00:40:25,283 --> 00:40:28,733
The age cohort model is really substantially a better fit.

320
00:40:32,013 --> 00:40:39,363
Is this clear? This is kind of key to interpreting the facts in the models.

321
00:40:46,253 --> 00:40:49,523
I could do the same for women and I'll see.

322
00:40:50,033 --> 00:40:54,173
Similarly, a much smaller I see the age period covered.

323
00:40:54,473 --> 00:41:03,113
This is primarily driven by the fear itself, the negative life likelihood, rather than the number of parameters in this case.

324
00:41:03,953 --> 00:41:09,033
Question. So age period cohort still has a lower AC than age cohort.

325
00:41:09,563 --> 00:41:14,453
Are you preferring age cohort because of the the former is not identifiable.

326
00:41:14,873 --> 00:41:24,143
Correct. So in their age career cohort models, they're making the assumption that the cohort effects are on average a zero.

327
00:41:24,563 --> 00:41:28,733
So they're only telling you you have cohort effects, which is fine.

328
00:41:29,243 --> 00:41:31,823
And we'll look at those what those models look like in a second.

329
00:41:33,023 --> 00:41:41,993
But my preference is, at least as a first step, is to really diagnose what is driving the event, do it.

330
00:41:42,023 --> 00:41:47,153
Is it the cohort or is it the period or. Right, I guess I see like.

331
00:41:49,153 --> 00:41:52,783
Kind of two questions like do the actual numbers matter?

332
00:41:53,053 --> 00:41:57,253
Or is it more about comparing those values and like what is a significant.

333
00:41:57,693 --> 00:42:02,823
Friends and relatives. Perfect. Great. So the first question is, do the actual values matter?

334
00:42:03,183 --> 00:42:07,053
And basically, no, they do.

335
00:42:07,083 --> 00:42:14,193
They like practically no. So practically speaking, you only care about the difference in the AC.

336
00:42:14,433 --> 00:42:25,743
So actually when I like write papers about this, I almost always present relative AC with like an asterisk being like the baseline ac value is this.

337
00:42:25,953 --> 00:42:32,103
But really, I only care about that. This one is like 200 words, actually 6000 more than the other one.

338
00:42:32,313 --> 00:42:39,093
That's that's what I care about. The second question is how to interpret like one point of AC.

339
00:42:39,813 --> 00:42:48,633
So one point of AC is essentially one parameter or or two parameters, rather.

340
00:42:49,743 --> 00:43:00,483
And so the question is how many? So what I like to think about it is how many parameters do what I need to add to get one point better of AC.

341
00:43:01,233 --> 00:43:03,183
And so if you look at the difference, you're like,

342
00:43:03,573 --> 00:43:15,963
I need 6000 more period parameters or 3000 rather 3000 more period parameters to get at the same fit that my cohort model is getting.

343
00:43:17,253 --> 00:43:21,723
And that's like ridiculous, right? And so that that's kind of helping us.

344
00:43:22,503 --> 00:43:28,383
This one is very clear. Often you'll get ones that are kind of like, which way do I go with that?

345
00:43:28,623 --> 00:43:33,233
And it becomes a more a difficult question. But those are both questions.

346
00:43:34,533 --> 00:43:46,783
Other questions. So what do the fates of these models look like?

347
00:43:48,493 --> 00:43:58,873
So this is an age cohort model with the period effects estimated from the residuals.

348
00:43:59,263 --> 00:44:04,063
So what that means is I take an age cohort and model and I say, okay,

349
00:44:04,693 --> 00:44:12,733
there's going to be some residuals and I'm going to regress my my residuals against my that calendar year and just see what that looks like.

350
00:44:13,483 --> 00:44:22,753
In this case, the age cohort model, I had this shape of cancer incidence, lung cancer incidence.

351
00:44:23,173 --> 00:44:30,193
This is a nine over time analog scale cohort.

352
00:44:30,583 --> 00:44:45,703
What I see is a fairly flat cohort effect in terms of incidence up to about 1930, 1930 after 1938 begins to decrease.

353
00:44:47,023 --> 00:44:53,293
Okay. And so what's happening around 1930 that is impacting my cancer incidence?

354
00:44:55,593 --> 00:45:00,633
Surgeon general warning. Surgeon general warning happens in the 1960s.

355
00:45:01,443 --> 00:45:04,623
But it's a good guess. But it is it is around smoking.

356
00:45:05,553 --> 00:45:17,402
So the people that are born in 1930 are the people that are going to be influenced by the changes in smoking,

357
00:45:17,403 --> 00:45:22,383
prevalence, new health warnings when they're a little bit colder.

358
00:45:23,223 --> 00:45:29,643
And so oftentimes so this is one of the tricks in interpreting cohorts is that this is the year that they're born.

359
00:45:30,243 --> 00:45:33,693
When do the health effects start? Right.

360
00:45:34,443 --> 00:45:42,093
Because they're not smoking as soon as they're born. They are getting they're smoking when they're 16.

361
00:45:43,203 --> 00:45:48,303
They are getting cancer when they're 50, 60, 70.

362
00:45:48,873 --> 00:45:50,493
And so that's always something to keep in mind.

363
00:45:50,703 --> 00:45:58,113
But we're seeing this very encouraging reduction and lung cancer incidence as a function of reduced health problems.

364
00:46:00,063 --> 00:46:05,073
This period effect is actually very nice to see because this is saying actually

365
00:46:05,223 --> 00:46:12,243
there's very little impact of calendar year on lung cancer incidence risk.

366
00:46:13,743 --> 00:46:21,693
And that's suggesting that like like you don't smoke for one year, but then you go back to it or you're like isn't really making a difference.

367
00:46:21,933 --> 00:46:26,523
It's this lifetime cumulative exposure. Okay.

368
00:46:26,733 --> 00:46:29,883
But let's say that we don't we don't want the age cohort model.

369
00:46:30,063 --> 00:46:38,823
We think the age period model is better. So again, we're going to take the what I don't want to hear.

370
00:46:42,973 --> 00:46:50,173
Sorry. I forgot about this for a second. Let's just look at the age period cohort model.

371
00:46:51,073 --> 00:46:52,543
In the age period model,

372
00:46:52,813 --> 00:47:03,913
they're attributing the downward incidence to the period and that's saying that we have to have a cohort effect that peaks and then comes down.

373
00:47:05,353 --> 00:47:08,503
It's plausible. It doesn't fit as well.

374
00:47:10,933 --> 00:47:15,613
And it's really what's happening is that you have this idea of the cohort,

375
00:47:15,613 --> 00:47:21,223
both the period and cohort effects kind of need to be contorted in order to make them better data.

376
00:47:21,463 --> 00:47:25,243
And so from my perspective, it's a little less likely.

377
00:47:25,783 --> 00:47:36,223
Um. The blue is the full age period cohort model where we have aging period and then the constrained cohort.

378
00:47:37,123 --> 00:47:41,683
And what you can see is that you actually cannot even see the black except maybe a little bit here.

379
00:47:42,133 --> 00:47:48,253
The age period cohort model is essentially fitting the same as the age cohort model.

380
00:47:48,823 --> 00:47:53,143
These particular models fit in well and that gives us a little bit more,

381
00:47:53,743 --> 00:48:02,753
even more and uh, looks certainly for evidence that cohort is really what's driving.

382
00:48:04,213 --> 00:48:14,173
If I do this for women, I can get fairly similar effects where the cohort model is saying that there's not much period of effect,

383
00:48:15,013 --> 00:48:23,503
but the cohort effects a little bit different. Here we have that similar kind of downward trend, but we have this kind of interesting upward trend,

384
00:48:24,763 --> 00:48:31,273
and that's largely because tobacco use in women was lagging that of men for a long time.

385
00:48:31,573 --> 00:48:40,163
And so it actually only peaked in around the 1930 birth cohort was increasing prior to that and decreasing afterwards.

386
00:48:40,273 --> 00:48:44,803
So that's sort of interesting to happen on the same side.

387
00:48:46,563 --> 00:48:49,623
New questions in interpreting these age period developments.

388
00:48:55,033 --> 00:49:03,612
Okay. So yeah. So and here's what the ACP is in their AC DC and AP dash.

389
00:49:03,613 --> 00:49:07,843
See it is is the first one the one where you have aging cohort.

390
00:49:08,473 --> 00:49:21,913
Yes. So, so this is a this like this taxonomy or the best way of saying it is a very is very look at the package.

391
00:49:22,363 --> 00:49:31,153
It's not really how I think about it more generally, but before the dash are the main effects and after the dash is the fetch residuals.

392
00:49:32,263 --> 00:49:43,093
Okay, so it's agent core and the actual model and dash period means that period effects are estimated from different age period.

393
00:49:43,663 --> 00:49:47,673
Cohort effects are estimated from there is of course, okay,

394
00:49:47,983 --> 00:49:53,233
age period cohort of three are main effects, except you have a constraint on cohort to make it.

395
00:49:55,843 --> 00:50:04,243
Actually it must be the on period because this is very obviously not averaging zero, um, averaging one in this case.

396
00:50:05,023 --> 00:50:08,563
So, and I see the period effects are constrained to be one.

397
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:19,153
So you take away from that from the age cohort and each year cohort ones being similar with that it shows that cohort is responsible.

398
00:50:19,423 --> 00:50:28,963
Yes. So you see not very much change in the shapes of the predicted values once you add period on top of cohort in this sense.

399
00:50:29,413 --> 00:50:36,223
Yeah. So the period is not changing how the cohort is affecting the defense.

400
00:50:41,033 --> 00:50:46,133
These, I would generally say, are the main outcomes, the main output of an APC.

401
00:50:46,133 --> 00:51:02,333
Although I do like to verify that I'm actually getting a reasonable effect of the data by plotting the predicted incidence on a hexagon.

402
00:51:02,993 --> 00:51:06,083
So that's what was happening here on the left. That's lung cancer for men.

403
00:51:06,323 --> 00:51:13,313
Here's the APC model and we can see, you know, it's a pretty good pretty the fidelity is pretty good here.

404
00:51:13,583 --> 00:51:17,633
I mean, it's not hitting like maybe exactly to fall over the nuances.

405
00:51:18,203 --> 00:51:24,323
Um, there's a little bit sort of like darker red here maybe that's not quite being captured.

406
00:51:25,133 --> 00:51:29,612
Um, but I think largely I'm quite happy with this.

407
00:51:29,613 --> 00:51:32,662
But if we do for women,

408
00:51:32,663 --> 00:51:38,273
we sort of similarly see they're being pretty good dense and the circular and we

409
00:51:38,273 --> 00:51:43,373
can see that this kind of circular pattern was really being driven by cohort.

410
00:51:44,033 --> 00:51:50,723
And so it's actually this diagonal trend that matters as opposed to the vertical trend.

411
00:51:55,583 --> 00:52:03,263
So everything we've done so far is really focused on the cancer perspective because this is a cancer

412
00:52:03,263 --> 00:52:11,613
modeling class for age group who are models really have nothing to do with cancer a priori or percent.

413
00:52:13,433 --> 00:52:23,933
And so I want to spend some time going through some other examples because I think this is a technique that I use over and over again in my research.

414
00:52:24,263 --> 00:52:28,163
And I think it's it's quite valuable to see other perspectives.

415
00:52:29,423 --> 00:52:33,383
So this first one we're going to look at is HPV prevalence,

416
00:52:35,033 --> 00:52:43,822
where we see prevalence in general HPV prevalence over time and relative general prevalence.

417
00:52:43,823 --> 00:52:50,843
So these are cohort effects by cohort by race, ethnicity.

418
00:52:50,963 --> 00:52:59,203
So black Americans, Hispanic Americans, white Americans, we can see that we have fairly similar trends and prevalence by age,

419
00:52:59,213 --> 00:53:04,723
really kicking around the mid twenties, around that sort of sexual behavior peaks.

420
00:53:05,363 --> 00:53:13,493
But we have a much higher prevalence for black Americans and the birth cohort effects are also quite similar.

421
00:53:13,833 --> 00:53:20,823
We have just a decrease in prevalence in the birth cohorts from the 1940s through about 1970.

422
00:53:21,803 --> 00:53:25,643
It's a little unclear. These really should have confidence intervals.

423
00:53:25,853 --> 00:53:29,273
I did this when I was a graduate student, so like can forgive myself here,

424
00:53:29,453 --> 00:53:34,253
but these are really have confidence intervals and to have a sense of like how real,

425
00:53:34,283 --> 00:53:45,203
how and how concerning is this much higher increase and the effects for black women and is this going to continue to rise?

426
00:53:46,043 --> 00:53:52,513
And so we see these racial disparities. But this is prevalence, right?

427
00:53:52,523 --> 00:54:01,493
We have and I talked about how you do prevalence. And so we did that labeling for incidents.

428
00:54:01,793 --> 00:54:06,293
And that's appropriate because a log link gives us only positive values.

429
00:54:06,653 --> 00:54:11,963
We take the log that exponentially any number and it becomes positive.

430
00:54:12,953 --> 00:54:19,493
And so that's appropriate for incidents, but it's not very prevalent because prevalence is constrained to you between zero and one.

431
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:23,903
And so we're going to do a logic link instead.

432
00:54:25,103 --> 00:54:31,193
So for those of you who are familiar, the incidence is basically doing Poisson regression.

433
00:54:32,273 --> 00:54:38,492
For prevalence, we're doing logistic regression. She might actually put those on the slides.

434
00:54:38,493 --> 00:54:42,983
Both. All right, you want to.

435
00:54:43,293 --> 00:54:48,813
So instead of prison regression, we're going to do logistic regression, the logic of prevalence.

436
00:54:49,053 --> 00:54:58,863
So that's the log of P over one minus P. This allows us to transfer to transform between the entire real number line and a number of C0 and one.

437
00:54:59,133 --> 00:55:11,073
That's our goal here. I will note that these models are a little bit funny for prevalence because they do some kind of like weird the way that they.

438
00:55:11,853 --> 00:55:19,353
It's not just like a translation and kind of has to like throw them out and throw them in to the effects are a little bit funny.

439
00:55:20,093 --> 00:55:35,133
Um, but it does work. And so this was a really influential paper on smoking prevalence by Ted Holford and Company.

440
00:55:35,543 --> 00:55:42,933
This is smoking prevalence and you can see not only differences in shape and size,

441
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:48,453
not only size but shape in terms of smoking prevalence by birth cohorts.

442
00:55:49,413 --> 00:55:58,473
And I think and for men and women. And so again, so actually here this is kind of interesting.

443
00:55:58,833 --> 00:56:04,833
You see we see that the 1890 to 95 to these breath targets that were like a little bit before 1930,

444
00:56:05,073 --> 00:56:16,113
they're really low and they kind of really ramp up to the 1930, 1935 cohorts here for women, whereas for men they were already pretty high.

445
00:56:18,903 --> 00:56:25,863
So that is that's really a completely different analysis, but really comporting well with the reason for lung cancer incidence.

446
00:56:26,973 --> 00:56:37,053
These shapes are kind of fun because they actually didn't do it on prevalence itself, but on smoking, initiation, smoking sets and smoking cessation.

447
00:56:37,533 --> 00:56:47,373
And then you're having, you have this kind of, um, perspective of the, like we did in the nineties forerunner sort of in prevalence models.

448
00:56:47,673 --> 00:56:52,713
So wondering how smoking initiation, smoking cessation change over time impacts smoking prevalence.

449
00:56:54,303 --> 00:56:58,863
They also looked at cigarets per day and other aspects of smoking.

450
00:57:00,273 --> 00:57:07,383
And so what you can do with this now is say, okay, I have my estimates of smoking prevalence,

451
00:57:07,803 --> 00:57:12,453
I have what the cohort effects are telling me is going on.

452
00:57:12,813 --> 00:57:16,983
If I project those cohort and period effects farther into time.

453
00:57:18,003 --> 00:57:23,813
This gives me another way to do projection that's not simply or not.

454
00:57:24,153 --> 00:57:32,373
I shouldn't say simply if that is alternative to that mechanistic perspective that we didn't make in this corner.

455
00:57:32,613 --> 00:57:40,803
This is a much more statistical perspective that still allows us to do a fairly nice projection sort of moving forward.

456
00:57:41,283 --> 00:57:50,523
Again, this is going to require us to have spines or another continuous function that allows for a smooth projection forward of the effects.

457
00:57:51,033 --> 00:57:56,163
Because if you're if you're just estimating individual years, then you don't know what the future years are going to be.

458
00:57:56,523 --> 00:58:01,593
So this is relying on that continuity. So that's what they did here, is that you can see models.

459
00:58:07,563 --> 00:58:11,343
This is another one of my work that I get.

460
00:58:11,383 --> 00:58:22,253
But the important lab here thinking about antibody patterns to influenza and trying to understand how these patterns of titers.

461
00:58:22,263 --> 00:58:29,793
So who is who has antibodies to different influenza strains who care for different strains of influenza?

462
00:58:30,813 --> 00:58:35,613
Wisconsin 2000 5901 and Texas 2012.

463
00:58:36,363 --> 00:58:44,403
And understand how these affects. So you see a very different pattern here as opposed to these other three, which are very similar to each other.

464
00:58:46,593 --> 00:58:53,043
And so we would like to know, for example, the cohort effects that we're seeing.

465
00:58:53,973 --> 00:59:04,113
Are they for effects and B, do they depend on like people have generally thought, the birth cohort you're in when that virus first circulated,

466
00:59:04,593 --> 00:59:17,403
so do your your titers to with companies that are five depend on your age relative to 25 do your titers to 79 depend on your age relative to 2000.

467
00:59:19,413 --> 00:59:25,053
And on the left, this is what happens if you look at age, at introduction,

468
00:59:25,383 --> 00:59:29,283
this is a cohort effect because it's age relevant relative to a certain year.

469
00:59:29,943 --> 00:59:35,543
And what we see is that all of these viruses change.

470
00:59:35,883 --> 00:59:41,522
The titers to the viruses had a very similar shape, but they're a little bit translated from each other.

471
00:59:41,523 --> 00:59:43,953
They're not quite on top of each other.

472
00:59:44,133 --> 00:59:54,903
And if we shift them so that they are, it turns out that this is essentially saying that it's not age X strain introduction,

473
00:59:55,563 --> 01:00:01,323
but age at the introduction of what we call the antigenic cluster.

474
01:00:01,953 --> 01:00:08,793
So these set of viruses related antigenic layer in their how they affect the immune system.

475
01:00:09,033 --> 01:00:12,332
And so when I was doing this work, I was like, oh,

476
01:00:12,333 --> 01:00:19,893
it's a little bit like obvious that if you have an antigenic cluster that's defined by how it's affecting antibodies,

477
01:00:20,443 --> 01:00:24,963
you would expect them to depend on COVID effects to depend on antigenic cluster.

478
01:00:26,313 --> 01:00:29,633
But what's interesting is that that is not isn't what people thought before.

479
01:00:31,653 --> 01:00:39,213
And so what we see is that we see this consistency when we switch to the new antigenic cluster rather than the strain itself.

480
01:00:42,993 --> 01:00:47,583
And then I think this is my last example. This is drug overdose death.

481
01:00:48,153 --> 01:00:52,683
So this is this is the group that did that came up with hex maps for the first time.

482
01:00:52,923 --> 01:00:58,713
So this is the paper that that that this was associated with.

483
01:00:58,893 --> 01:01:06,063
I remember seeing them present at epidemics in 2019 and just being like, this is the coolest thing that they did.

484
01:01:06,303 --> 01:01:13,173
Each period cohort on opioid overdose and national mortality data.

485
01:01:13,683 --> 01:01:22,623
And so what they what the data show is that there's this really fairly large increase in overdose mortality, starting with the 1945 birth cohort.

486
01:01:23,853 --> 01:01:29,223
So so we can see this really strong cohort effect here and a really strong age effect as well.

487
01:01:32,613 --> 01:01:41,773
And so this is just the data here. We'd like to kind of explain it in terms of each period cohort and what they did.

488
01:01:42,123 --> 01:01:48,033
They didn't use incidence. They didn't use prevalence specifically.

489
01:01:48,243 --> 01:01:59,673
They came up with a fairly sophisticated model to describe mortality as normal curves or Gaussian curves as a function of age, height and people.

490
01:02:00,723 --> 01:02:06,723
And so here there fits to certain cohorts. So you can see this sort of like y flat becoming more and more peak.

491
01:02:08,343 --> 01:02:17,283
One drawback I would say is that it's a little unclear how well these are going to fit at older ages for these groups.

492
01:02:17,283 --> 01:02:20,643
And so a little bit careful about overinterpreting these.

493
01:02:21,033 --> 01:02:29,883
But overall, I think this is a really nice, uh, and clever way of thinking about the patterns here.

494
01:02:30,963 --> 01:02:41,313
And what they found was very clear phases of how the peak age and the peak height changed over time.

495
01:02:42,333 --> 01:02:54,243
And so if they plot birth cohort by birth cohort, the peak age of he height, they find this trend starting that like 1945 of increasing peak height.

496
01:02:55,323 --> 01:02:59,583
So that's basically this stage here, the blue is becoming the green.

497
01:03:00,573 --> 01:03:10,083
Then phase two, starting in the 1960s of the peak height staying the same, but people having earlier and earlier deaths.

498
01:03:10,863 --> 01:03:17,703
So we have this kind of height, green height here, more or less staying the same, but it's moving to the left.

499
01:03:18,963 --> 01:03:29,983
And finally, in 1980, we start getting a really higher another increase in overdose magnitude of the index.

500
01:03:30,043 --> 01:03:38,583
So, again, from the orange to the red, no real change in the where the peak happens, but the peak height.

501
01:03:40,263 --> 01:03:45,813
And so that's like you don't see that it's just by looking at the data.

502
01:03:46,113 --> 01:03:50,193
This is really neat from my perspective analysis here.

503
01:03:51,483 --> 01:03:56,253
And so this they really tie these to what's going on.

504
01:03:56,583 --> 01:04:06,243
And each of the different generations of the baby boomers must really seeing this increase in overdose mortality for Gen Xers.

505
01:04:06,633 --> 01:04:11,163
Decreasing age of millennials, again, increasing overdose mortality.

506
01:04:13,523 --> 01:04:20,273
And if we look at what's going on for these different cohorts,

507
01:04:22,043 --> 01:04:28,663
we can and kind of tying them to what's going on in terms of like the drugs that are available and policies.

508
01:04:28,813 --> 01:04:33,503
TIME We can think about the first prescription opioid wave,

509
01:04:34,223 --> 01:04:42,713
the heroin wave and the fentanyl wave because of how these these effects are affecting the different cohorts over time,

510
01:04:42,713 --> 01:04:47,123
we're really seeing boomers mostly being affected by the first prescription opioids,

511
01:04:48,113 --> 01:04:53,483
Gen-X with heroin, and then millennials starting to overtake in the fentanyl.

512
01:04:55,073 --> 01:05:02,123
That's a lot becoming. So a really nice way of decomposing the data here.

513
01:05:05,133 --> 01:05:09,183
Any questions? I mean, these examples are.

514
01:05:12,833 --> 01:05:20,383
Just a couple of minutes left here, have some discussion questions that two questions.

515
01:05:20,393 --> 01:05:26,213
The first is now that we have we understand age and period covered a little bit better.

516
01:05:26,453 --> 01:05:32,453
We understand how they interact and some examples of each.

517
01:05:33,413 --> 01:05:40,643
Can you think of a disease or a disease, a risk factor that would probably be best described as an age cohort model,

518
01:05:40,973 --> 01:05:44,183
an age period model or a cohort period model?

519
01:05:44,963 --> 01:05:48,413
We saw a cohort period model in the antibody titers.

520
01:05:49,733 --> 01:05:58,223
And then the second question is a little bit more practical and and trying to head off potential issues in the lab six.

521
01:05:58,823 --> 01:06:05,123
Suppose you are looking at your APC results and you're looking them maybe by sex and by race.

522
01:06:05,603 --> 01:06:13,793
And you say that like, okay, well, some of the groups are better than by age cohort and some of the groups are greater than by age period.

523
01:06:14,813 --> 01:06:22,973
What do you do? How do you think about that? What what sort of how do you proceed?

524
01:06:22,983 --> 01:06:29,783
And in discussing the data and presenting the results?

525
01:06:30,273 --> 01:06:33,653
Do you just say some of them are this, some of them are that?

526
01:06:33,803 --> 01:06:41,093
I shrugged. That's what that's what the models say. Or how do you want to sort of put some more structure on?

527
01:06:41,573 --> 01:06:47,453
So we'll pause here and let you chat about it.

528
01:06:47,453 --> 01:06:54,808
We'll come together a little bit. For the first example, like let your mind run.

529
01:07:01,737 --> 01:07:07,767
We have a age code, age cohort example that we would like to volunteer.

530
01:07:14,517 --> 01:07:17,816
It's happening for some reason.

531
01:07:17,817 --> 01:07:23,337
Lung cancer. So each. Sure. That's that's the that's sort of like classic 101.

532
01:07:23,337 --> 01:07:26,647
That's not not lung cancer.

533
01:07:26,667 --> 01:07:33,937
Not even cancer in general. Maybe shingles.

534
01:07:33,987 --> 01:07:42,087
Okay, that's a good one. So, like, so the chicken pox, uh, virus.

535
01:07:42,327 --> 01:07:46,737
And how this one's very interesting because you have both.

536
01:07:47,067 --> 01:07:55,377
So childhood diseases are infected, fact are circulating, but also you have different vaccines for children and for adults.

537
01:07:55,377 --> 01:08:08,487
And, um, I'm not a super expert on Duracell, but I think that that's a very interesting one, would probably like very complex effects that.

538
01:08:10,287 --> 01:08:14,006
The thing I want to highlight about COVID effects is that this is typically going to

539
01:08:14,007 --> 01:08:21,477
be diseases that have long exposures or long differences between the risk factor.

540
01:08:21,837 --> 01:08:26,337
And how about each period you want to have a good age period.

541
01:08:34,637 --> 01:08:42,887
Then we were talking for this one about the pandemic, just because it depended on your age and the period of the pandemic.

542
01:08:42,887 --> 01:08:48,016
But we were talking more so about the people who were in nursing homes just because like

543
01:08:48,017 --> 01:08:51,166
during this time the diaphragm was in the nursing home and like my mom talks about,

544
01:08:51,167 --> 01:08:53,117
like go out there and have the gallbladder hear.

545
01:08:53,207 --> 01:08:58,277
All the caretakers were saying that they're like the minds of the people in the nursing home were just like

546
01:08:58,577 --> 01:09:02,777
completely like plummeting just because they had such a lack of social interaction during that period.

547
01:09:02,927 --> 01:09:08,477
Okay. So so is the outcome like mental health or what it was like there?

548
01:09:08,627 --> 01:09:12,177
Like patients dementia was getting worse. Okay. Okay.

549
01:09:12,257 --> 01:09:20,987
So so dementia specifically. Okay. That said, that certainly seems plausible to me that you have dementia, certainly age related.

550
01:09:21,227 --> 01:09:27,147
And it could be that in this specific time period, you have, of course, outcomes, this great cohort period.

551
01:09:27,147 --> 01:09:32,197
This is the tricky one. I heard you guys talking about pollution.

552
01:09:32,207 --> 01:09:37,627
I think that that's certainly plausible. I definitely kind of you know,

553
01:09:37,637 --> 01:09:47,377
I was thinking like things like thalidomide or like drugs that were like banned at a certain point but really affected kind of developmentally.

554
01:09:48,167 --> 01:09:52,097
That's something along these lines. So that's.

555
01:09:52,427 --> 01:09:55,607
So lots of interesting ways that these kind of come up here.

556
01:09:55,907 --> 01:09:59,327
And how about this APC results are different.

557
01:09:59,457 --> 01:10:03,497
If you're just at the beginning, you're trying to diagnose age coworkers the age period as a starting point.

558
01:10:03,977 --> 01:10:09,257
Some of them are some some of them out there where you go from here. So I heard you had one suggestion.

559
01:10:10,157 --> 01:10:15,767
Oh, I mean, my suggestion was just to use the full APC model with the constraint in that case.

560
01:10:15,857 --> 01:10:20,057
Okay. So so you're like, I can't it's not really deciding consistently.

561
01:10:20,297 --> 01:10:23,447
Let me just put the whole model on there. I think that's reasonable.

562
01:10:23,657 --> 01:10:28,697
I think the goal is to really be able to compare all of the models to to be able to to say,

563
01:10:28,697 --> 01:10:32,717
like, I want to see how cohort is coming across all of them.

564
01:10:32,897 --> 01:10:44,147
I see um, periods coming across all of them. Alternatively, another option would be to do a group AIC to be like,

565
01:10:44,147 --> 01:10:54,727
I want to fit all four of the models simultaneously and add up their aces so that I can see whether as a whole age cohort or age period,

566
01:10:54,737 --> 01:10:58,847
that's better because you really you really, really, I think care.

567
01:10:58,847 --> 01:11:05,447
And you also said theoretically you want to pick a cohort probably in this case, maybe the other things for other cases.

568
01:11:05,447 --> 01:11:09,677
But you want to you don't want to just be following the outputs of the models.

569
01:11:09,917 --> 01:11:15,457
You want it to make sense in terms of the underlying concepts and you want to be able to compare.

570
01:11:15,587 --> 01:11:19,407
So no one right answer, but those are the things I want.

571
01:11:19,607 --> 01:11:24,077
But we'll stop there. I'll hang around for the next half an hour.

572
01:11:25,117 --> 01:11:29,237
People have questions on the labs and then that will be in the lab,

573
01:11:29,597 --> 01:11:36,047
computer lab next week to finish up joint point and maybe get started on the APC models.

574
01:11:38,877 --> 01:11:40,347
I hope our ABC models.
