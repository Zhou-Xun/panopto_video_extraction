1
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,290
Ed Hartwick : Alright, I will i'll do a screen share here.

2
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:23,070
Ed Hartwick : and hopefully it'll work out.

3
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:27,540
Ed Hartwick : let's go with the window it's so now let's do it the entire screen.

4
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:30,570
Ed Hartwick : And then.

5
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,180
let's see.

6
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,540
Ed Hartwick : All right, you guys seeing my screen there.

7
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,380
Kevin John Dombkowski: So I introduced put it in presenter mode.

8
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,970
Kevin John Dombkowski: I have that.

9
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:43,950
Kevin John Dombkowski: I think's.

10
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:48,030
Kevin John Dombkowski: hit the button here.

11
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,820
Ed Hartwick : Open there we go.

12
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,550
Ed Hartwick : Ah yeah.

13
00:00:53,550 --> 00:01:01,890
Ed Hartwick : Well, my poor computer definitely well so.

14
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:03,600
Kevin John Dombkowski: what's your thinking.

15
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:13,500
Ed Hartwick : Oh yeah I mean I don't know what it's deal is lately, but I think probably it's that whole updates available button that's available that's sitting there waiting for me to click it.

16
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,290
Is.

17
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:23,550
Ed Hartwick : It a it seems to think that that's the kind of the way to go there all right it's doing something.

18
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:30,030
Ed Hartwick : As you can see, they give us, you know top notch equipment here at the state.

19
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:33,930
Ed Hartwick : And i'll apologize uh early on to.

20
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:40,230
Ed Hartwick : i'm getting over a bit of a cold, which actually makes it like me, makes me feel a bit better about.

21
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:47,700
Ed Hartwick : Not being there in person, because I don't want anybody to have to to deal with the same crowd that i'm dealing with currently.

22
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:55,710
Ed Hartwick : Fortunately it's not coven but it's still pretty CNN working on some cough drops here so.

23
00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:00,720
Ed Hartwick : Hopefully that will work out now can you still see it or did it throw off into the wrong screen.

24
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:07,950
Kevin John Dombkowski: But we're in sort of the preview mode, so I think you're going to have to go back to the display settings there and yeah.

25
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,570
Ed Hartwick : I think so.

26
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:11,940
Kevin John Dombkowski: into the slide.

27
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,440
Ed Hartwick : There we go.

28
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,140
Kevin John Dombkowski: yeah check your all take it away at.

29
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:30,150
Ed Hartwick : All right, well move some stuff off to the side too, so you can kind of see the the screen that you guys can see and seeing you the classroom at the same time away alright so.

30
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:47,280
Ed Hartwick : Obviously i'm in hartwick I have been with me dhhs since 2006 and since 2010 as as we've mentioned i've been kind of in charge of the MDS itself.

31
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:57,240
Ed Hartwick : I work with a team of about five informatics specialists, we have we basically kind of cover all things.

32
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:04,350
Ed Hartwick : Through for the MDS s itself, and also for a lot of the messaging that comes in and through.

33
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:20,130
Ed Hartwick : Our systems as well and i'll try and detail some of those as I come along through here too and, of course, you know if there are any questions you know feel free to enter interrupter you know, however, you want to do it, I tried to be a pretty.

34
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:31,590
Ed Hartwick : casual person in my presentations and so I certainly won't get you know hung up inside of any procedural stuff so all right.

35
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:36,900
Ed Hartwick : First off I do want to kind of give a background on public health surveillance and reporting.

36
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:41,220
Ed Hartwick : Just in general and, of course, as it pertains to Michigan so.

37
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:57,090
Ed Hartwick : You know, public health surveillance and here's a couple of quotes up here that we had kind of pulled together, for this is really just kind of you know, the ongoing collection, analysis of data, trying to kind of get a picture of what is going on.

38
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:00,960
Ed Hartwick : You know in in the world.

39
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:13,380
Ed Hartwick : And of disease surveillance and whatnot it's really there to make sure that the the population that we are are looking into we can kind of can give get a handle on.

40
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:25,590
Ed Hartwick : You know what the trends are and what sometimes what the specifics, are now public health informatics to is kind of the the information base behind that kind of.

41
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:31,680
Ed Hartwick : stuff as well in informatics as a as a term itself as one that I hadn't heard.

42
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,310
Ed Hartwick : You know, even as much as I think seven years ago.

43
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:42,030
Ed Hartwick : i've really kind of liked the term and we used to kind of refer to ourselves as info magicians.

44
00:04:42,030 --> 00:05:00,840
Ed Hartwick : But I think right now I think it's a it's a really APP term that kind of moves us away from you know kind of the nitty gritty gritty of data analysis and and as much into like data architecture and data movement so.

45
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:13,440
Ed Hartwick : The public health surveillance sources there's kind of a list of sources, you know, often provide information to debbie genealogist and those folks in public health to kind of follow up on, you know the population health in general.

46
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:25,920
Ed Hartwick : I won't go into a whole lot of specifics and a lot of these, but you know most of what md SS deals with is inside of this individual case reports area.

47
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:31,020
Ed Hartwick : We do it that's really kind of our bread butter of this.

48
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:36,990
Ed Hartwick : The the MDS itself is there to track.

49
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:43,050
Ed Hartwick : All the reportable conditions in the state the reportable conditions are defined by.

50
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:55,740
Ed Hartwick : You could have a regulation or the state health department which is pulls it source from the the Public Health Code saying that if you know these list of roughly 90 conditions.

51
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:04,110
Ed Hartwick : appear in the state, you must notify the local and therefore also the state public health department, so the follow up can be done.

52
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:22,410
Ed Hartwick : A lot of times is there to you know, to monitor stuff but also to do our hand is, as we can into prevention so um that also kind of rolls into the nationally notifiable disease surveillance system which is really the the national level of this as well, so.

53
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:40,890
Ed Hartwick : from the ground up type of thing the in Michigan we're like a homeroom state home rural state, so the local public health department has all the power and then notification then runs up to the State health department and the State health department, then notifies the national.

54
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:50,940
Ed Hartwick : Disease regal and system at the CDC and, as you can kind of see here, you know this is kind of what the CDC is track, this was pulled from their website.

55
00:06:50,940 --> 00:07:02,010
Ed Hartwick : And so you know kind of in this also kind of shows that same progression where you have a patient, you know it goes to the healthcare system into the health department.

56
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:10,140
Ed Hartwick : And then up to CDC and then the CDC their their aspect of is is often providing a nationwide view.

57
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:22,980
Ed Hartwick : of a lot of this kind of stuff our role as a health state health department is to not only you know help facilitate you know follow up with the local health department, but also to you know provide that statewide view as well, so.

58
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:28,050
Ed Hartwick : And just to make sure to you guys can see my mouse on here as i'm circling stuff right.

59
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:38,310
Ed Hartwick : So okay cool okay cuz i'm kind of doing that here and there, and i'm like Oh, it would make much sense if I can't do if it doesn't if you guys don't see it at all so.

60
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:47,670
Ed Hartwick : All right, um and then, as I mentioned surveillance in communicable disease in Michigan is kind of based out of the the the Public Health Code that which is.

61
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:59,760
Ed Hartwick : You know Michigan filed laws regulation 320 5.171 and and the idea is that list of pathogens that exists, are those that are required.

62
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:18,690
Ed Hartwick : Basically, by whoever comes across it in Michigan we're also kind of known as a dual reporting state and the idea, there is that the simplified version of that really is that if you come across in an official capacity, a report for reportable conditions.

63
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:28,140
Ed Hartwick : Then you need to notify the local health department and so that goes for providers goes for laboratories hospitals private labs.

64
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:43,980
Ed Hartwick : You know, public labs you know all the sorts so ideally if a physician identify something and sends it to a lab and then that lab say outsources it to a second lab because of you know capacity issues.

65
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:58,650
Ed Hartwick : Then, technically, we should get rid three reports, the same condition, you should get one from the performing lab one from the lab that had pass it along, which is the referring lab and then also from the provider themselves providers often.

66
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:03,330
Ed Hartwick : They often don't do it unless it's a really important.

67
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:14,190
Ed Hartwick : condition and mostly because they they often just rely on the fact that they know that laboratories themselves are the ones who do a lot of the reporting anyway.

68
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:24,570
Ed Hartwick : I think in the future that may change as, as you know, technology allows more interconnectedness but we'll talk about that a little bit anyway.

69
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:30,810
Ed Hartwick : All the local health departments are required to invest the case, the cases of notifiable diseases.

70
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:34,410
Ed Hartwick : And like I said, you know it's a local rural.

71
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:47,820
Ed Hartwick : State, so the local health departments work on it, and then they asked they pass on that information to us and you know we provide any assistance that they might need.

72
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:58,920
Ed Hartwick : Part of the notification is the patient demographics, as well as the you know the the the disease, so we do require you know name, date of birth.

73
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:11,640
Ed Hartwick : You know, address phone number any information that provider or a laboratory might have about the person, so that we can follow up with those people and then anything that they have in the form of results so.

74
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:26,670
Ed Hartwick : You know whether, if there's if they had tested for antibiotic resistance and some things we ask that they send those along with it as well, so that kind of information is usually what's flowing our way.

75
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:36,270
Ed Hartwick : In general, and because of that, you know Michigan in the system we work with works at a both a local and state health department level.

76
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:50,550
Ed Hartwick : So the local health departments will log into the MDS s and the MDS S, will you know is hosted at the state and so really reporting to one entity use reporting to all entities, at the same time, at least inside the state so.

77
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:53,070
Kevin John Dombkowski: And I have a quick question or clarification.

78
00:10:53,070 --> 00:11:00,660
Kevin John Dombkowski: So one just for background so on our course website, I have posted the.

79
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:04,740
Kevin John Dombkowski: reportable diseases which is this really long list, as you know.

80
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:08,820
Kevin John Dombkowski: Do you have any any sense of how that.

81
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:12,690
Kevin John Dombkowski: Might compare to other states do states typically.

82
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:19,650
Kevin John Dombkowski: start off with the CDC list and sort of expand or contract from there, how does that work.

83
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:27,540
Ed Hartwick : yeah and and it's gonna be very similar state the state each State will have some variation in it.

84
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:31,830
Ed Hartwick : Just because there are some priorities and conditions that.

85
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:37,860
Ed Hartwick : are important to some states and unimportant to others like say, for instance, a lot of.

86
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:44,520
Ed Hartwick : You know i'm trying to give a good example of this, but there's a lot of like say.

87
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:52,590
Ed Hartwick : You know mosquito borne pathogens that that you know, are more common out in you know the desert area, then they would be out here.

88
00:11:52,590 --> 00:12:03,900
Ed Hartwick : And so they may not be reportable in Michigan and they may not be reportable nationally, because they are you know just more localized in the country.

89
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:09,090
Ed Hartwick : The State tends to follow.

90
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:19,110
Ed Hartwick : It to try to have at least the all of the the national notifiable diseases as well, so if you know.

91
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:24,660
Ed Hartwick : salmonella's nationally notifiable disease, so therefore it's a reportable disease and Michigan as well.

92
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:41,490
Ed Hartwick : And that is kind of you know it's one of those aspects of it's a priority for nationally it's a priority for us, there are other items on top of that inside of Michigan and say that aren't necessarily reportable backup to the state to the CDC.

93
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:54,300
Ed Hartwick : And those are there are fewer farther and farther between but um yeah it's and they would also vary from State to State, I think, like, for instance, I think Wisconsin.

94
00:12:54,300 --> 00:13:09,300
Ed Hartwick : Like I think they're they have a group the strap that might be reportable I haven't exactly just check their list lately, but we do kind of get some reports from Wisconsin based systems for those sometimes.

95
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:25,440
Ed Hartwick : And where it's not reportable in Michigan so but it's you know they're usually pretty close influenza would usually be a good one for that to like influence it in Michigan isn't individually reportable um, but in some states, it is and.

96
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,060
Ed Hartwick : But, in general, most of them kind of follow the track of what.

97
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:34,020
Ed Hartwick : CDC marx's nationally notifiable.

98
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,030
Kevin John Dombkowski: It great Thank you.

99
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:44,940
Ed Hartwick : And and a good comment to the having this is that typically we we only update the reportable list once a year, usually towards the beginning of the year i'm.

100
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:45,780
Ed Hartwick : Just to make it.

101
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:54,450
Ed Hartwick : easier for for people who are doing the reporting to kind of you know, fall into line with okay well you know it's been a year let's make sure we.

102
00:13:54,450 --> 00:14:11,370
Ed Hartwick : check to make sure the state hasn't updated, something that we didn't anticipate the exemptions of those of those will be course be like you know conditions that are of great importance and show up after the beginning of the year, of course, Kobe being one of those.

103
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:16,950
Ed Hartwick : Though you know I think we kind of almost had enough enough of a heads up with coven.

104
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:26,430
Ed Hartwick : And in the beginning of 2020 that we probably could have made it reportable a little earlier than we did, but still was reportable before it actually hit the state so.

105
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:29,640
Ed Hartwick : Alright, moving on.

106
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:34,470
Ed Hartwick : And so i'm going to kind of cover a little bit of the history of.

107
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:40,050
Ed Hartwick : CD reporting in Michigan I mean this is kind of a brief overview if anything.

108
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:49,320
Ed Hartwick : It has, at least for this part here um we've done electronic reporting in the state for since about the MID 90s.

109
00:14:49,320 --> 00:15:06,630
Ed Hartwick : Although this this bit here predates my service here and I I don't even think i've actually seen LSD serve in action, but the idea was that was the kind of the original of dots based.

110
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:22,620
Ed Hartwick : kind of precursor to the MDS so it was the the way that the local health departments could report their numbers to us so that we could then report them on to CDC in a much quicker way, then you know just faxing.

111
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:31,350
Ed Hartwick : If I remember right you actually actually had to dial into a modem at the state to be able to to to reach out the database.

112
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:35,640
Ed Hartwick : And yeah it was certainly kind of interesting.

113
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:50,460
Ed Hartwick : But as we mentioned here it's a it's a transmission of data just from a local health departments to us it was DAS base real limited information that they have seen printouts of it it's it's really it was really something, but you know, not a whole lot of information.

114
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:58,950
Ed Hartwick : With that you know into the beginning of the 21st century we kind of realized that you know that isn't just going to cut it.

115
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:05,160
Ed Hartwick : And at the same time, we had the anthrax attacks and.

116
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:21,750
Ed Hartwick : That kind of availed itself some funding for us to create a new system, so we created the the Michigan disease surveillance system and the idea, there was that it was going to be a web based system that all local health departments, be able to get into.

117
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:30,900
Ed Hartwick : So this and as we're kind of talking about here this this kind of the Info behind it it's a web based database tool.

118
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:42,780
Ed Hartwick : We had kind of developed it off of you know, the national standards what they expected at the time for the surveillance system and then in the States.

119
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:47,220
Ed Hartwick : And then we we kind of work between us and.

120
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:53,910
Ed Hartwick : The State health departments and CDC to try and you know kind of really fleshing out in a way that.

121
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:57,990
Ed Hartwick : We felt would work for us.

122
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:05,520
Ed Hartwick : Other states of the time we're doing kind of the same thing, and so you know we ended up with a several different.

123
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,980
Ed Hartwick : ways to do it.

124
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:20,760
Ed Hartwick : We feel that are you know hours worked out really well for us, but this provides a secure transfer maintenance and analysis of the of the communicable disease to be super disease surveillance information.

125
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,850
Ed Hartwick : And so, basically, the information and then.

126
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:34,440
Ed Hartwick : it's held the stable locals are provided access to it, they can update cases and at that point becomes becomes a system of record for them.

127
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,170
Ed Hartwick : The information is held there.

128
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:43,560
Ed Hartwick : And then you know de identified for transmission of to CDC is as needed.

129
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:48,600
Ed Hartwick : The idea, though, is that we, because you can.

130
00:17:48,600 --> 00:18:06,450
Ed Hartwick : Because it is a web access system with you know authentication through the state systems, and you know it's it's actually a pretty easy thing to get in and sign up for you know from from a usability standpoint.

131
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:24,210
Ed Hartwick : It provides a lot of utility for both locals and for the state at that point to we can let say healthcare providers access the data they send in the same as laboratories as well, to be able to give any extra information that they might.

132
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:30,540
Ed Hartwick : need to be able to give or you know make reports in general, so.

133
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:47,700
Ed Hartwick : And the idea behind it, those was really not only to look at disease surveillance for the state, but also to kind of make sure that we were to more quickly respond to emerging db emergent diseases and biological terrorism so.

134
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:55,680
Ed Hartwick : As I had mentioned, we it was kind of a group effort amongst a lot of folks to create this.

135
00:18:55,680 --> 00:19:02,730
Ed Hartwick : I don't I wizard not around when when the system started, so I kind of run on the second hand now and Jen this kind of thing.

136
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:16,170
Ed Hartwick : but really it was kind of a cooperative ever between the the state bureau of EPI, which is where we were housed at the time, local public health agencies, you know time Institute, who was handling a lot of the messaging stuff.

137
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:22,710
Ed Hartwick : The stc the scientific technologies corporation, which was the the company that had originally designed.

138
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:25,950
Ed Hartwick : The DSS and, of course, our.

139
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:31,380
Ed Hartwick : d amp D, which is now or di t of the IT department at the state.

140
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:37,860
Ed Hartwick : And of course the Center for geographic information, which is where we got a lot of our our mapping and to cody.

141
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:59,700
Ed Hartwick : So pulled together, we made a the MDS So the idea here, of course, you know i'll throw this kind of timeline here as well, is to really kind of shorten this piece right here are the the the diagnosis, to the report type of buried here.

142
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:13,830
Ed Hartwick : And this has been there's been throwing a few other ideas of where we can you know items that we see in other pieces of surveillances where they kind of fall in where we a bio watch system where you actually would be.

143
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:24,510
Ed Hartwick : You know, say capturing like biological agents out of the air, which would kind of show you things happening when their exposure could actually happen.

144
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:32,730
Ed Hartwick : symptom onset stuff like over the counter surveillance or or you know food like illness aggregate information that we get from.

145
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:40,410
Ed Hartwick : from schools and then an aspect of syndrome surveillance was seeing usually seeking when we seek medical care.

146
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:44,970
Ed Hartwick : And we capture that information through us and dreadlocks syndrome surveillance system.

147
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:59,220
Ed Hartwick : And of course the MDS s which handles really the all this stuff from after the diagnosis, because none of its kind of information reaches to us until we get either a diagnosis or positive lab result of some sort.

148
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:05,550
Ed Hartwick : We might get a little bit earlier saying the seeking of medical care if a doctor.

149
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:06,660
Ed Hartwick : suspect, something that.

150
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:19,590
Ed Hartwick : could be you know, have a have a very urgent nature, they would probably call the local health department, then, and then the report would be made in a little bit earlier so.

151
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:26,040
Ed Hartwick : These are kind of system some slides that I had borrowed from a previous.

152
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:31,080
Ed Hartwick : iteration of this talk and I think they they still fit pretty well in here.

153
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,890
Ed Hartwick : Although, in a way, you know, in the.

154
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:38,220
Ed Hartwick : It might be kind of a you know.

155
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:50,970
Ed Hartwick : kind of a dust statement in a way of why build a system, why you know move from a paper system into an electronic system, but it also kind of gives us a little historical perspective here.

156
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:57,600
Ed Hartwick : Where the old system was a paper system, we need to move into a an idea of more real time and more.

157
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:10,050
Ed Hartwick : timeliness and this was you know the time of the creation of this was when you know, there was still a bit of pushback and moving things into a digital age, especially in the in the healthcare world.

158
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:19,740
Ed Hartwick : And you know another aspect of this, though, that wouldn't necessarily have to do with that would be the fact that we didn't have data silos at the time.

159
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:38,070
Ed Hartwick : Before we would have like okay well communicable diseases could use all hd server they had their own group of people, an STD had their own because they were you know they had enough, you know cases and whatnot to handle as as her own group, tuberculosis they're they're.

160
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:58,080
Ed Hartwick : There they've had systems and and you know and whatnot for a while on this kind of thing and really kind of accumulated their own data there and, of course, HIV as well, because they are very you know it's a very at the time he even a very taboo subject, so their data was.

161
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:04,230
Ed Hartwick : held really siloed as well, and so, when you have all those separately.

162
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:15,300
Ed Hartwick : You don't get a lot of you know cross information about you know you might know something more in communicable disease about a person that may be STD doesn't you know, maybe they could handle they could they could.

163
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:22,770
Ed Hartwick : Use the contact number that maybe you had gotten previously or or you know they didn't get the an address in off of something and.

164
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:26,040
Ed Hartwick : You may have her or vice versa.

165
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:36,390
Ed Hartwick : So that data silos breakdowns and you know and, of course, you know co infection information is also you know helpful in treatment and in.

166
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:43,170
Ed Hartwick : Surveillance as well, so breaking down those data silos and putting everything into one system is often very helpful.

167
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:53,190
Ed Hartwick : So on a lot of course, along with that, as well you know we end up with a you know, an old system where we didn't collect as much of the information that we really could have.

168
00:23:53,190 --> 00:24:04,470
Ed Hartwick : Where the system allows you know a lot more expansion of that kind of data just being able to store it electronically and search on it later.

169
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:17,370
Ed Hartwick : And, of course, there was you know the aspect of just being able to build a system that were local public health and state public health can communicate collaborate on things a lot better as well.

170
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:31,500
Ed Hartwick : Those are all important aspects of this, but you know, in a way now, this is kind of old news I mean the modern society that we live in, with the in the in the instead of a fully into the digital age.

171
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:40,110
Ed Hartwick : The ideas of you know, doing things on paper and sending faxes, it seems to be you know kind of just relic of the past but.

172
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:56,460
Ed Hartwick : I think sometimes it's a good thing to perspective perspective that folks actually had to be really convinced to to be able to put effort into this so to talk more about the MDS s and kind of get you guys familiar with how these things work.

173
00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:00,030
Ed Hartwick : We kind of go.

174
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:07,230
Ed Hartwick : On a little bit about the the functionality it's in it, and one of the key pieces of this is, you know kind of the permission set.

175
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:26,640
Ed Hartwick : Inside the system you'll find that there is like a there's for real role basis spots within the system here you're looking at a laboratory a role at health care provider, what role local health department role in a state health department and the idea here is kind of each area.

176
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:38,460
Ed Hartwick : ends up with slightly differently tailored and for you know kind of permission set within the system, based upon their need to have what they need to see and what they need to be able to access.

177
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:44,520
Ed Hartwick : The system also on implementing limiting things by like disease groups and jurisdictions and even job function as well.

178
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:55,110
Ed Hartwick : So, like you could have a State user who is only a data entry person, the same as you can have a local health department, who is only a data entry person, and you can have a you know.

179
00:25:55,110 --> 00:26:03,240
Ed Hartwick : say a State user who is a system administrator but not necessarily a local health department, who is a system administrator.

180
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:19,470
Ed Hartwick : Because of just the roles of the functions healthcare providers in laboratories, though, in general, all both have very similar kind of roles in the system where you're looking at a lot of limited access health care providers and laboratories both can really only see.

181
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:23,070
Ed Hartwick : The data in the system in which they provide.

182
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:26,820
Ed Hartwick : So if you know, say, a beaumont.

183
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:36,540
Ed Hartwick : infection control person were to access into the MDS so they would only see cases in from beaumont.

184
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:40,590
Ed Hartwick : And the same with the laboratory type of thing to the idea, there is that.

185
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:50,490
Ed Hartwick : You know, we found over the years that healthcare providers and laboratories can often contribute things beyond just you know lab results and initial case reports that sometimes they can.

186
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:58,530
Ed Hartwick : it's it's there they have a whirlwind and being able to follow up with extra notes and things that are are helpful to the disease investigations.

187
00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:13,290
Ed Hartwick : And so having them have access to their data that's in the system is often quite helpful and, of course, it also limits like that, by the disease group and so like say if you if users determine to only need to do.

188
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:22,560
Ed Hartwick : To have access to this their STDs because that's the only job that they work at inside of this local health department.

189
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,050
Ed Hartwick : Then they can be limited to that.

190
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:38,820
Ed Hartwick : And the same would go for like I say a general CD but they have options to be able to expand those in kind of group those types of permissions in based upon you know what a person's job duties are so.

191
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:49,980
Ed Hartwick : Alright, moving forward the MDS, it also has a series of break built in tools, as well as we can kind of put it it's really kind of the features of the systems itself.

192
00:27:49,980 --> 00:28:03,210
Ed Hartwick : It is a person based system, so the idea is that you can have a single person inside the system, who can have multiple cases, so you can have a person who likes to who you know.

193
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:14,820
Ed Hartwick : Maybe had you know someone else case in 2007 but later was found to have hepatitis C in 2015 and they can be linked to the same person.

194
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:24,930
Ed Hartwick : And then you know, being able to make sure that you know you can rely on the data that exists in the system to be able to either contact the person or see a person's history.

195
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:27,420
Ed Hartwick : As needed.

196
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:44,550
Ed Hartwick : So with that comes the even need the ability to duplicate people who are in the system and who come into the system match them correctly to the the white person's there's a geo coding aspect, because we are a Home Rule state, and we are a.

197
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:56,790
Ed Hartwick : Can of the system itself is hosted and maintained by the state, we need to be able to assign conditions out as they come in, so when you when you have.

198
00:28:56,790 --> 00:29:18,360
Ed Hartwick : An address on a case it will it will GEO code that find the correct jurisdiction for the person and place them in that jurisdiction, of course, searching and query examples you know you can't it's not useful have a database that you can search alerting for for, especially for.

199
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:33,360
Ed Hartwick : low incidence cases or you know, whatever the user feels that they need to be alerted, for if they want to be alerted for every single case that comes in that they're responsible for they can make an alert for that, if they want to say okay well i'm in the system regularly, but you know.

200
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:46,230
Ed Hartwick : Give me an alert if we hit above a certain quota of cases, so that you know I know that something crazy going on, and you know we I had a good example of that.

201
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:52,380
Ed Hartwick : From one of our colleagues who report was responsible for.

202
00:29:52,380 --> 00:30:04,530
Ed Hartwick : A for for the levy cola response and she was at a conference so she wasn't usually actually in and checking in on that day, and she had gotten an email saying hey.

203
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:13,080
Ed Hartwick : You know you're you're illiterate for the Eco ECO lie responses has been triggered because we've gotten a lot of cases in today.

204
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:24,270
Ed Hartwick : And she ended up going in and finding that there was you know, an actual outbreak going on, that she had to respond to, and you know conference, time is going to be limited so.

205
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:34,170
Ed Hartwick : That kind of stuff reports obviously very helpful in general, not only to be tracking what people need to do, but also.

206
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:52,530
Ed Hartwick : You know, to to you know inform others of how your work is progressing maps which because you know the spatial aspect of these types of things we always very important and, of course, we have an outbreak management system as well, so the cover a little bit of duplication like we had said.

207
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:58,980
Ed Hartwick : it's kind of gives a quick view of screenshots of some of the items in here we're Basically, we can see that we have.

208
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:06,840
Ed Hartwick : You know, this is the the patient, the duplication of the top where you have a person that comes in, and you get potential matches to that to.

209
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:22,380
Ed Hartwick : choose which one to emerge to, of course, and this is emerged screen itself on the patient merge, so you can say okay well you know this person they go by Freddie, even though their name is Fred so we'll leave this in here like this and.

210
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:29,940
Ed Hartwick : We had we didn't know before whether you know what their ethnicity was and we now know that they're non Hispanic.

211
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:36,750
Ed Hartwick : And we have a phone number and so that those types of things are the items that can be chosen chosen from an emerged into.

212
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:45,330
Ed Hartwick : A course and then the end after you merge the person, you have to decide whether this is insane case or not now Obviously these two are not the same, so you didn't creating a new one.

213
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:58,710
Ed Hartwick : But um with that the patient de duplication, a lot of it handles on the name it uses a sound style matching names so basically it'll it'll understand.

214
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:15,750
Ed Hartwick : You know misspellings and provide potential potential matches for that it also understands common nicknames we also look at you know potential for name reversals where say a person's first and last thing or accidentally flip flopped in there.

215
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:21,180
Ed Hartwick : And then those scores that are kind of mentioned in here are based upon.

216
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:23,550
Ed Hartwick : kind of a.

217
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:31,680
Ed Hartwick : Matching between the name matches the how close the date of birth matches ethnicity phone number and address.

218
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:41,370
Ed Hartwick : So it doesn't match other items on there that that you see like say you know parent or guardian information stuff like that.

219
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:47,670
Ed Hartwick : The system can automatically match things now initially when we built the system.

220
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:55,980
Ed Hartwick : You know, like we mentioned people were a bit weary of these kind of technology, and so we made sure that that every single.

221
00:32:55,980 --> 00:33:08,580
Ed Hartwick : Item that came into the system was matched manually as time went on, and people grew more trustful of the system and its abilities and we were able to you know.

222
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:15,690
Ed Hartwick : develop an automatic matching system so where it takes basically says, it would be able to.

223
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:18,960
Ed Hartwick : Take an exact name name match.

224
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:33,270
Ed Hartwick : date of birth match and provided there's no conflicts of race and ethnicity or anything that should require a person's input and either a phone number or address match it will automatically merge those people.

225
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:35,430
Ed Hartwick : Then we launched that.

226
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:43,260
Ed Hartwick : The automatic matching we've figured well probably will get about you know 10 to 20% of them will automatically match just be given.

227
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:59,370
Ed Hartwick : Given the kind of information that we have in the system and the likelihood of you know, being able to identify that kind of thing and actually it had done a lot better than that, I think the initial phase of of that was looking at.

228
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:09,630
Ed Hartwick : You know even it was even then it was looking at exact matches on race and ethnicity, not even just conflicts and we were still getting about a 40% match on automatic matching.

229
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:17,460
Ed Hartwick : which was you know we were pretty surprised at how all that was doing, I think we did make some gains after we tweaked it so that.

230
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:29,220
Ed Hartwick : As long as it would you know, the only it would match against a an unknown, so if a person had a race information that came in on the lab and they had no existing race information.

231
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:39,630
Ed Hartwick : It would consider that a match, and so that was very helpful, we also found I think it's kind of surprisingly enough that phone number works, really, really well.

232
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:47,160
Ed Hartwick : As an identifier, I think it's one of those it's kind of under appreciated when you think about identifiers for people but.

233
00:34:47,160 --> 00:35:00,540
Ed Hartwick : You know phone numbers can change frequently, but a lot of times, if you know, myself included, i've had the same phone number for 20 years so you'll see that happen quite a bit.

234
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:01,590
Ed Hartwick : And then.

235
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:04,050
Ed Hartwick : case the duplication and that's really kind of the.

236
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:22,080
Ed Hartwick : The big deal is there's two bits of duplication there's a patient duplication in this case the duplication and then allows the the incoming case to be merged with an existing case, so if we do get say those duplicate labs coming in it doesn't make to duplicate cases.

237
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:30,480
Ed Hartwick : We have made some strides here lately to for automation.

238
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:39,450
Ed Hartwick : It started out with hepatitis C, because they had a specific algorithm that worked really well of like okay well if it was this kind of lab that comes in.

239
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:59,190
Ed Hartwick : And this is this, you know this person has an existing case with these certain specific criteria is then you can automatically merge the incoming into the existing case and that worked out really well to to handle a lot of duplication automatically.

240
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:07,740
Ed Hartwick : kind of the the apex of that almost seems to be what we've done with coven because the massive amount of data that we have received for that.

241
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:26,400
Ed Hartwick : We actually are using the codes for the test themselves to determine the case status when they the cases come in, we use time based algorithms to time and case status based algorithms to determine whether an incoming.

242
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:32,100
Ed Hartwick : blab needs to be merged with an existing one or whether it should create a new case automatically.

243
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:38,760
Ed Hartwick : And the algorithm is kind of fine tuned enough now that if.

244
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:42,060
Ed Hartwick : infinitely chronic lab comes in.

245
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:51,600
Ed Hartwick : The only possibility that will happen for for manual interfaces if if the system cannot determine whether the person is an exact match for a person or not.

246
00:36:51,600 --> 00:37:03,330
Ed Hartwick : So after you move the move move through the patient, the duplication on electronic lab input, the case duplication is automatically handled for everything for Cobra now.

247
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:23,070
Ed Hartwick : we've also done a bit of that for STDs as well, so you know so it's really kind of automation is the the wave of the future for a lot of this kind of stuff even with a bit more complex rules, it was just something we even struggled with 10 years ago so.

248
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:31,410
Ed Hartwick : Moving on GEO coding, which is probably kind of almost would say the unsung hero, the system itself.

249
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:41,550
Ed Hartwick : We use a service, and so the state for GEO coding it's based on a usps based address standardized.

250
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:46,230
Ed Hartwick : And so we will take the address and send it over to.

251
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:55,980
Ed Hartwick : Our GEO coding service it's inside the state, it will standardize the address based upon post office standardization rules.

252
00:37:55,980 --> 00:38:06,180
Ed Hartwick : On GEO code it and then provide back the standardized address and the lat long coordinates, of the other places as well.

253
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:22,230
Ed Hartwick : In that message that sent back is included the county that the cases in which allows us to do jurisdiction assignment, so if the case comes in that's you know.

254
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:24,690
Ed Hartwick : mainstream Nan arbor.

255
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:34,200
Ed Hartwick : It will you know Code, the address give the lat long coordinates and then notify the system that this is a washtenaw county case.

256
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:43,020
Ed Hartwick : Those lat long coordinates the also allow us to use mapping features inside the system and here we've got a screenshot that kind of shows.

257
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:45,780
Ed Hartwick : You know example of this out of our.

258
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:47,880
Ed Hartwick : Things is that about.

259
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:58,410
Ed Hartwick : Trying to think or staging system that has entirely fake data and what you're seeing here is the the the green crosses be the case that that.

260
00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:06,270
Ed Hartwick : Is the is inside the this the map is inside the case that is that case itself and then.

261
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:08,850
Ed Hartwick : The blue cross's are.

262
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:18,150
Ed Hartwick : cases that were think believe we were reported within seven days, the same condition so kind of an interesting feature on that.

263
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:30,630
Ed Hartwick : Sometimes it's helpful sometimes it's not seeing as currently this only looks at a person's home residents, so if you know say if it's a foodborne outbreak and exposure was at you know.

264
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:37,830
Ed Hartwick : An event Hall, it may not be as useful other than the fact that it would show that you know.

265
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:49,560
Ed Hartwick : My you know, say that the the place where they had eight is probably not too far, so there is a definitely a geospatial correspondence to an increase in cases so.

266
00:39:49,560 --> 00:40:05,910
Kevin John Dombkowski: I have a question about that so i'm just in general um let's say i'm in the upper peninsula and I have some reportable case when i'm in marquette is it GEO coding, my home address or where the cases reported.

267
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:18,900
Ed Hartwick : It would to code your home address likely, and this is kind of one that we've been, this is a kind of a struggle we've had over the years, well so like if you were on vacation up in the up.

268
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,550
Kevin John Dombkowski: But market.

269
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:22,830
Ed Hartwick : And you have an illness.

270
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:29,850
Ed Hartwick : And you go to the doctor most likely the doctor will be you know or or you know stay in a lab dry or wherever.

271
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:43,080
Ed Hartwick : The hospital a healthcare organization, most likely report your home address and not your temporary address so it's you know, while you're on vacation and that's mostly because that's the address that you would provide to them.

272
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:45,150
Ed Hartwick : Is your home address.

273
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:47,790
Ed Hartwick : or your billing address, for that matter.

274
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:51,780
Ed Hartwick : What happened then a lot of times they say.

275
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:52,860
Ed Hartwick : If you.

276
00:40:52,860 --> 00:41:11,520
Ed Hartwick : If you were on bigger than in Washington county Washington county would then get Ahold of you and say all right well you know, give us the details and during the interview, they would find that you're actually located in marquette and at that point it's really kind of.

277
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:19,800
Ed Hartwick : An internal discussion between, say washing and marquette county as to whether you know which one wants to have jurisdiction over.

278
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:30,510
Ed Hartwick : They may change your address in the system to be your temporary address up in marquette and so therefore you know they have that they will be able to contact you.

279
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:45,300
Ed Hartwick : get more information about the places you've been whether you know, because in some cases, it really is probably more pertinent that it is considered a case in marquette county rather than Washington county because that's not where you can try to the condition.

280
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:51,270
Ed Hartwick : Other times it's it's just a matter of like well you know I mean say with lyme disease there's a good chance that you had.

281
00:41:51,270 --> 00:42:03,750
Ed Hartwick : Gone on vacation up North and got bit by a tick and you may not have realized, you were sick until you got home because you wouldn't develop some symptoms, possibly for another couple of weeks and.

282
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:06,900
Ed Hartwick : With that and you're.

283
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:07,770
Ed Hartwick : You know, you would.

284
00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:09,240
Ed Hartwick : Most likely be counted as.

285
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:11,160
Ed Hartwick : At your home.

286
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:21,150
Ed Hartwick : But they would probably make a notation that you know you had probably contracted it will be on vacation previously so.

287
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:27,360
Kevin John Dombkowski: Okay, we have another question yeah Jane they.

288
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:33,120
Kevin John Dombkowski: would like the stuff that you track that we should address and then like the health department does.

289
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,160
Kevin John Dombkowski: He like what.

290
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:37,830
Kevin John Dombkowski: Okay, so did you hear that or do you want me to repeat.

291
00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:40,440
Ed Hartwick : I give a repeat, but I think I caught, most of it.

292
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:57,090
Kevin John Dombkowski: So, with respect to the salmonella outbreak, such as going on with the I believe it's onions so would eat a link to where the person actually you know purchased the product versus where they live.

293
00:42:57,090 --> 00:43:09,330
Ed Hartwick : And that it could, it would be, but not say through God so like if that in that case the the case would be coded with your home address.

294
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:17,160
Ed Hartwick : But during the interview with you, they would get your food history, and they would go back and they say Oh, and in the case here, and this is.

295
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:29,670
Ed Hartwick : pretty much how they had ever it was onions anyway, was that they would go through, and say okay well, what did you have, and you know, listen to kind of go down and they'd find the kind of common things between.

296
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:46,830
Ed Hartwick : I eventually, I think, and this was a tough one, from what I understand, with the onions, because you know onions isn't usually it's not like lettuce you don't go out and buy a lettuce and eat lettuce and you go out and buy lettuce needless you don't exactly go out and buy onions onions.

297
00:43:46,830 --> 00:43:49,050
Ed Hartwick : it's an ingredient.

298
00:43:49,050 --> 00:43:52,140
Ed Hartwick : that's that's more easily.

299
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:58,050
Ed Hartwick : kind of hidden inside of things because it's not a it's not usually a featured agreed.

300
00:43:58,050 --> 00:44:00,240
Ed Hartwick : And so.

301
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:06,330
Ed Hartwick : Usually, a lot of that comes out through food history, at that point and say okay well where did you have this.

302
00:44:06,330 --> 00:44:13,410
Ed Hartwick : Okay, well, I had this at the store or something like that right, I you know we put onions in this, you know it finally.

303
00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:18,060
Ed Hartwick : They come down to the point that, when you were doing the home cooking you had onions, a lot everybody had onions.

304
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:21,930
Ed Hartwick : They all traces Okay, what do you get your onions, where we get our onions from kroger.

305
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:33,210
Ed Hartwick : And well okay well we're just kroger good there onions, they get their insurance from Mexico and it turns out all these other people also got their audience from Mexico and that's kind of where a lot of this will come through.

306
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:40,830
Ed Hartwick : And it's sometimes it's a bit easier with with like I think main course meals like.

307
00:44:40,830 --> 00:44:46,440
Ed Hartwick : You know, there was a ground beef recalls and stuff like that make it a lot easier, but.

308
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:56,040
Ed Hartwick : You know, then that kind of thing so yeah it would go by, that I think there is a definitely a a.

309
00:44:56,040 --> 00:45:01,800
Ed Hartwick : kind of a utility that could be used in being able to enter more.

310
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:16,110
Ed Hartwick : Geographical Information about this kind of stuff to that make that kind of analysis, a bit easier, so if you're doing a food history if you have spot in there, where you could put in an address that address could be GEO code or standardized.

311
00:45:16,110 --> 00:45:22,260
Ed Hartwick : Then it might be a lot easier for the database to go through, and say hey you know we got all of these foods here, you know.

312
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:36,810
Ed Hartwick : we're seeing a history pattern where people have been shopping at kroger or something like that you know I hate to call out kroger but you know I mean it comes to mind, because there was an outbreak having to do with ground beef and kroger some years ago.

313
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:42,000
Ed Hartwick : And I just was wondering, I actually you'd have to map out as well.

314
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:49,650
Ed Hartwick : So yeah that's that's a long answer.

315
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:56,280
Ed Hartwick : Just excuse me just.

316
00:45:56,280 --> 00:46:10,170
Ed Hartwick : Alright, I didn't want to give a loud cough through the through the PA system in the room, so alright, moving on and, of course, like if we have any questions on any of these things we can always come back to them too, so.

317
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:20,700
Ed Hartwick : Here we have kind of like the example of the kind of the basic search that you would come into the system, and this is really just kind of looking at the items that most people end up searching on when they come in.

318
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:25,350
Ed Hartwick : you end up having your investigation ids if you know, specifically the one one you want to look at.

319
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:35,880
Ed Hartwick : that's the fastest way to go, otherwise your first and last name search, you can search for stuff that by an investigator name so i'm like Okay, well, we need all this stuff that Mary cook is is.

320
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:45,450
Ed Hartwick : been investigating for the last week, so you can put your investigation name in here and then put in the referral date of the last week or so that things were looking you can.

321
00:46:45,450 --> 00:46:56,850
Ed Hartwick : You can limit by your jurisdictions or by counties, the regions and, of course, even health systems so that can that can be all things that we're limited on.

322
00:46:56,850 --> 00:47:07,350
Ed Hartwick : Take wise, we have a lot of options as well, the date that the case was entered in the system, the birthday of the person referral date the onset data, the symptoms, even the week in which it happened.

323
00:47:07,350 --> 00:47:18,360
Ed Hartwick : And the the MW our calendar weeks those those date weeks on their own are kind of interesting they're they're kind of the CDC standards week calendars.

324
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:29,550
Ed Hartwick : The so in a lot of times, if you see like publications, especially from CDC okay well this week we had this and or the four week.

325
00:47:29,550 --> 00:47:45,030
Ed Hartwick : We you know, there was X number of cases and that's that's reference to this calendar here and it's the idea it's going to be they try to standardize the the calendar Monday or Sunday through Saturday week.

326
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:48,420
Ed Hartwick : And so week one will start.

327
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:57,900
Ed Hartwick : In a year we'll start with the Sunday that can contains the most the Sunday of the week that contains.

328
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:12,060
Ed Hartwick : The majority of the first week of January, which is kind of the weird way of putting it but say if you're in if you're January 1 is on a Tuesday, then your your week one starts on December 30 the previous year.

329
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:26,550
Ed Hartwick : If you're January 1 is on a Friday, then your week one starts on January third of the current here and so that that way they kind of have standard Sunday to Sunday kind of weeks lined up.

330
00:48:26,550 --> 00:48:32,760
Ed Hartwick : Most weeks, months years end up with 52 weeks, and occasionally I think every fourth or fifth year.

331
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:39,720
Ed Hartwick : They end up with 53 weeks so just kind of fun information there.

332
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:52,650
Ed Hartwick : here's the advanced feature basically based on you know the previous page it's the same kind of continuation and there's more of the kind of the less commonly used variables inside of searches.

333
00:48:52,650 --> 00:49:02,160
Ed Hartwick : And even then, this is, you know, this is our basic search, you can you can search across multiple conditions in a very quick way, using these items here if you wanted to search.

334
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:13,380
Ed Hartwick : For more specific information inside of, say, of a form, like all right, well, I I need to know all of the you know, hepatitis C cases where.

335
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:19,050
Ed Hartwick : You know the the person had been prescribed prescribed a specific drug.

336
00:49:19,050 --> 00:49:26,070
Ed Hartwick : That all that kind of information would be searched in inside of what we call our disease specific search.

337
00:49:26,070 --> 00:49:32,580
Ed Hartwick : So you look, you would be able to search on the items inside the forums themselves so.

338
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:37,800
Ed Hartwick : here's kind of an a quick example of the reports and the reports are what you expect to see out of them.

339
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:45,810
Ed Hartwick : they're kind of old screenshots of them, but but really quite frankly it's they're mostly either csv or pdfs a lot of our line list of.

340
00:49:45,810 --> 00:49:56,940
Ed Hartwick : Another example of them would be the EPI curve here like you see on the side here and, of course, we have an example of one of the maps that you can get to in the system, out of the reports page as well.

341
00:49:56,940 --> 00:50:07,140
Ed Hartwick : They won't go into a lot into those aspects, we do have a lot of additional information inside the system we have case definitions which are usually kind of.

342
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:20,370
Ed Hartwick : You know the one of the keys of you know, things in the end case definitions are really kind of determine how you know, a standardization across the country of how the class cases defined.

343
00:50:20,370 --> 00:50:38,040
Ed Hartwick : And the idea, there is like you know you want to have a you want to be able to compare stuff State to State, so you want to be able to say Okay, well, we feel that a case of this is only when there's a laboratory positive in it, otherwise it's considered maybe a probable case.

344
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:42,390
Ed Hartwick : You know if it's just a diagnosis by a physician without a laboratory.

345
00:50:42,390 --> 00:51:03,960
Ed Hartwick : You know coven ones are probably the ones that most familiar with, nowadays, you can only get a confirmed case of cowpoke coven if you have a positive PCR result so at that point you're you're saying that you know this person has had a sample taking from the nose and coven DNA was found.

346
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:09,540
Ed Hartwick : And that's really the only way, you can confirm a case of coven right now.

347
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:16,740
Ed Hartwick : The probable cases like say, if you have an antigen chest like one of those rapid antigens that are very common to have.

348
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:26,550
Ed Hartwick : Those the best they could make would be a probable case because at that point, you know that the person has had an immune response, they probably have had coven recently.

349
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:35,250
Ed Hartwick : But you don't know whether it's currently an active case or whether the person is you know technically over it, and and their antigens are just still at high levels.

350
00:51:35,250 --> 00:51:51,750
Ed Hartwick : And so that's why they will always say when you have a positive antigen case that they want you to follow up with a PCR tests so let's just kind of inform you find information there and see if you want to call it fun.

351
00:51:51,750 --> 00:52:01,710
Ed Hartwick : But we do have links to all the case definitions are held at the CDC we also have the ability to enter aggregate cases in the system so it's like say.

352
00:52:01,710 --> 00:52:07,950
Ed Hartwick : flu is a good example of this, because fluid general is not reported.

353
00:52:07,950 --> 00:52:10,740
Ed Hartwick : In an individual.

354
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:20,580
Ed Hartwick : You know it's not required to be reported individually in the state, but we asked that you know providers and schools and.

355
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:30,630
Ed Hartwick : You know, hospitals, give us aggregate count numbers of food that they have seen, and so they can then go into the system say okay for this week we saw you know 59 cases the flu.

356
00:52:30,630 --> 00:52:41,250
Ed Hartwick : And that way we can kind of keep tabs on the how bad the flu season is at any given point these end up and report, so we end up publishing on the websites.

357
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:50,670
Ed Hartwick : Of course, the alerts I had mentioned before, this is also in the system, the outbreak management system which is, which was originally kind of pulled together after.

358
00:52:50,670 --> 00:53:04,350
Ed Hartwick : You know the Ebola crisis and 2014 where we found a need for being able to have a system that could you know more easily do contact tracing and.

359
00:53:04,350 --> 00:53:12,810
Ed Hartwick : You know symptom monitor of people, so we can take people who, not necessarily make them into Ebola cases in the system.

360
00:53:12,810 --> 00:53:20,190
Ed Hartwick : Because they were not very likely to become an Ebola Ebola case, but we would be able to put them into a database, where we can say okay well you know.

361
00:53:20,190 --> 00:53:26,250
Ed Hartwick : Every 24 hours we've contacted the person and here are all of their reported.

362
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:41,550
Ed Hartwick : temperatures that they had and so that way we we knew we had records of follow up and be a lot easier to do initially um a lot of that kind of stuff when Ebola was going on with it happened through spreadsheet surveillance and that.

363
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:56,670
Ed Hartwick : That it really kind of underscores the need for having a system where we could do a lot of that kind of thing, of course, we also have the ability to interface with some other systems as well and i'll kind of get that I believe in, you know pretty much in the next slide so.

364
00:53:56,670 --> 00:54:03,900
Ed Hartwick : I think at this point to make sure you know, does anybody else have any other questions before we continue on with stuff.

365
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:06,600
Kevin John Dombkowski: I don't see any questions at this point at.

366
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:10,140
Ed Hartwick : All right, great cool right so.

367
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:17,760
Ed Hartwick : Because here's where we get kind of more into some of the fun stuff I think when you get into the system, integration and interfacing stuff.

368
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:35,280
Ed Hartwick : Now this is kind of a lot of the stuff that we've done really more within the last 10 years before then, I mean it really wasn't something that a lot of other systems had the ability to do and even even us we didn't really have much of an ability to do it either, but as kind of.

369
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:38,730
Ed Hartwick : More and more these interfaces have been developed across the country and.

370
00:54:38,730 --> 00:54:43,830
Ed Hartwick : You know, in the private sector and the public software we've we've kind of followed into those trends as well.

371
00:54:43,830 --> 00:54:52,230
Ed Hartwick : Although you know the one on the top of the list is kind of the service that we have been using pretty much since the beginning of the system at all, and that is our God.

372
00:54:52,230 --> 00:55:01,530
Ed Hartwick : it's not the same God that we had started with, but it has you know we've we have kind of improved it over the years.

373
00:55:01,530 --> 00:55:19,350
Ed Hartwick : or I shouldn't say we use the Center for shared solutions is really the ones handling it, but that is really just a straight up web call where you you take the address of the person put it to a web service in the geo coder and it then responds with a specific.

374
00:55:19,350 --> 00:55:22,800
Ed Hartwick : answer on the code that you're looking for.

375
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:33,660
Ed Hartwick : And so that has worked well for years, I think the only time that we've ever had problems with it is if they were actually literally having problems with the servers.

376
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:42,960
Ed Hartwick : themselves and that has gosh I have the the 10 years 11 years that i've been in charge, I think that's really only ever happened twice so.

377
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:46,500
Ed Hartwick : that's that's something to be said.

378
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:55,110
Ed Hartwick : let's see the maker, which is the Michigan care improvement registry, also known as our immunizations registry.

379
00:55:55,110 --> 00:56:08,370
Ed Hartwick : We now have the ability to vaccinate query for vaccine statuses Now this is kind of a very simple query it's very it's done manually inside the system, so you would go into.

380
00:56:08,370 --> 00:56:19,050
Ed Hartwick : A case and say all right, this is one of the conditions that can be queried for maker for vaccination status, you hit the button to do the query it sends.

381
00:56:19,050 --> 00:56:34,200
Ed Hartwick : A query to maker, and then returns a response if it has, if we can find a or answer if it can't find the answer doesn't necessarily mean that the person is not in maker it just means that you know you probably should go in there and have a look.

382
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:37,110
Ed Hartwick : If you have access, just to make sure.

383
00:56:37,110 --> 00:56:48,150
Ed Hartwick : The the query is pretty specific does have to it, can it can only really do one match So if you have a john Smith has a good chance that you're probably going to be digging through it by hand.

384
00:56:48,150 --> 00:57:01,410
Ed Hartwick : there's chances to improve the match ability of those kinds of things and that's actually kind of a good segue into the next piece here, which is our connection to the States master patient index.

385
00:57:01,410 --> 00:57:07,320
Ed Hartwick : Right now, the state has constructed a master patient index the idea, there is that.

386
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:19,860
Ed Hartwick : It we can store our current patient index that's inside of the MDS s or a copy of it up in the master patient index, and this can then in the background.

387
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:43,260
Ed Hartwick : match against other data sets as well, so like maker will have its patient index in there as well, and the system will say okay well you know john Smith birthday one 170 is the same as this john Smith one 170 over here with a 95% you know confidence level.

388
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:53,400
Ed Hartwick : So you know the system will say yeah these these two are very, very likely to be the same person now if I send an email a query to.

389
00:57:53,400 --> 00:58:03,570
Ed Hartwick : To the maker, and say i'm looking for john Smith 117 70 911 1970 Am I come back and I said I got these three people and at that point.

390
00:58:03,570 --> 00:58:08,640
Ed Hartwick : Our site isn't sophisticated enough to do that, but if we say so okay well.

391
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:19,650
Ed Hartwick : Steve mpi what's the maker ID for the person who you know is matched to john Smith one 170 on our side and they'll come back and say okay here's this person's maker it.

392
00:58:19,650 --> 00:58:28,050
Ed Hartwick : At that point we can say to the makers Okay, we need the the immunisation record, for you know, make a record number 12345.

393
00:58:28,050 --> 00:58:41,520
Ed Hartwick : And it will respond then with that record and you'll be able to get a better better level of precision on it now it's something we haven't quite gotten to yet for that, but it's something that is definitely around the corner.

394
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:50,070
Ed Hartwick : It could work that same way with other systems to the earlier part of the master patient index it works out well as well as if if say.

395
00:58:50,070 --> 00:59:00,510
Ed Hartwick : You know, we get a lab information that came in and we don't necessarily know the person's current address but say.

396
00:59:00,510 --> 00:59:10,500
Ed Hartwick : My bridges matches on that same person, maybe it knows what the current or at least a recent address for the person was and we can maybe pull that information from them.

397
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:18,600
Ed Hartwick : All this stuff is controlled by data use agreements, so therefore it's you know that's kind of the the the can't speak key standard.

398
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:23,190
Ed Hartwick : In there that that really kind of says to the.

399
00:59:23,190 --> 00:59:36,630
Ed Hartwick : People participating, these are really just for this kind of information and not anything else, so that that's kind of like the the the safeguard of of its own from from being.

400
00:59:36,630 --> 00:59:40,320
Ed Hartwick : wildly abused.

401
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:46,830
Ed Hartwick : Another item on this that we are connected to is the electronic death registry system.

402
00:59:46,830 --> 00:59:51,540
Ed Hartwick : In this case, the irs does work kind of like a.

403
00:59:51,540 --> 01:00:02,790
Ed Hartwick : Center for electronic messages in that if it sees a that a person has died of a reportable condition, it will actually send us a message saying.

404
01:00:02,790 --> 01:00:21,690
Ed Hartwick : john Smith one 170 he died of hepatitis C and F will get a copy of that information will be able to mark in our system, and this person is now deceased and that they have died of this condition in a case like hepatitis C we we would hope.

405
01:00:21,690 --> 01:00:24,360
Ed Hartwick : That you know.

406
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:37,290
Ed Hartwick : The the person's death is not the first time we heard of that case so, especially with chronic conditions like that, where a person is going to have it for a good chunk of their life.

407
01:00:37,290 --> 01:00:43,860
Ed Hartwick : This kind of information can be helpful for people who are doing follow up on those cases, because probably one of the more.

408
01:00:43,860 --> 01:00:54,930
Ed Hartwick : awkward and uncomfortable aspects of being a case investigators calling up and asking for somebody without the knowledge that you that the person had died, you know the week previously.

409
01:00:54,930 --> 01:00:57,420
Ed Hartwick : And that's going to be very.

410
01:00:57,420 --> 01:01:12,060
Ed Hartwick : Knowing very uncomfortable to be traumatic as well, so so knowing that information ahead of time is very helpful, it also allows us to make sure that we can find that information ahead of time, without necessarily having to do a lot of digging.

411
01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:26,790
Ed Hartwick : On that kind of information and be able to to more properly update our our death statistics and now we also get the message from the mpi as well kind of in that same kind of connection with them were say.

412
01:01:26,790 --> 01:01:34,080
Ed Hartwick : Since the ERS itself has a copy of its patient index in the mpi.

413
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:41,880
Ed Hartwick : If the mpi matches a person in ERS to a person in the MDS s it's pretty well.

414
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:55,020
Ed Hartwick : set it to assume that if you're in the electronic death registry system that you're probably died, and so they will send us a message saying the person is now deceased as of this date now.

415
01:01:55,020 --> 01:02:10,590
Ed Hartwick : They will on that kind of notification, they will not tell us what they had died from because that's kind of in the none of our business category, because if a person say had salmonella 10 years ago, who is still in our system.

416
01:02:10,590 --> 01:02:14,130
Ed Hartwick : And password as have a car accident.

417
01:02:14,130 --> 01:02:19,980
Ed Hartwick : You know, we don't need to know that they died of a car accident, we need to do need to know is that they had died.

418
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:30,540
Ed Hartwick : so that you know, on our end, we can have that information if say you know that information is being followed up on still or in in the other cases.

419
01:02:30,540 --> 01:02:38,370
Ed Hartwick : there's a good possibility that, as we get more of this information in we may be able to remove those people from potential matches.

420
01:02:38,370 --> 01:02:51,810
Ed Hartwick : Because there's no reason to match against the person who died, you know you match it for an incoming salmonella case against the person who died, five years ago, so.

421
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:55,230
Ed Hartwick : So that's kind of.

422
01:02:55,230 --> 01:03:03,690
Ed Hartwick : In in coming in, and you know kind of on the edge of news type of stuff things coming in there.

423
01:03:03,690 --> 01:03:11,280
Ed Hartwick : trace force that's another item that's kind of a new thing for for us it's kind of our internal.

424
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:21,390
Ed Hartwick : name for our contact racing so there's the software runs That in itself is called salesforce and it's for contact tracing so we've named it.

425
01:03:21,390 --> 01:03:24,540
transfers.

426
01:03:24,540 --> 01:03:30,960
Ed Hartwick : Currently it's held it as an outside system, but we directly interface with it we we had.

427
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:32,280
Ed Hartwick : Enough going with this with.

428
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:35,430
Ed Hartwick : When co would started because.

429
01:03:35,430 --> 01:03:43,290
Ed Hartwick : Some of our outbreak management systems really just didn't cut what we needed to do for contact tracing.

430
01:03:43,290 --> 01:04:00,180
Ed Hartwick : X as extensively what we plan for coven and and the software that we had been presented to for this we I think believe we sent it out for bid and come back and said, you know they really had all the features that we needed for it, so we have built up an interface, so that those.

431
01:04:00,180 --> 01:04:05,250
Ed Hartwick : With the items identified in cases that needed to be contact traced.

432
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:19,140
Ed Hartwick : can be sent automatically I believe twice a day over to trace, for us, and then we have a team of people who are in that system, who then make calls and follow up and do contact tracing based on that kind of information.

433
01:04:19,140 --> 01:04:36,000
Ed Hartwick : and the last thing I kind of have listed on here for interfaces is as a patient outreach interface, which is a new one that was presented to us, it was kind of I thought was a bit of a novel idea at first, but I think it has a lot of utility.

434
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:42,930
Ed Hartwick : And that is being able to electronically contact.

435
01:04:42,930 --> 01:04:49,740
Ed Hartwick : A patient about information with information about a condition that needs followed up on.

436
01:04:49,740 --> 01:04:54,180
Ed Hartwick : So with coven what we're doing here, for this is that.

437
01:04:54,180 --> 01:04:58,560
Ed Hartwick : If we get information in from.

438
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:05,040
Ed Hartwick : contact that saying okay well this person we believe is a spit suspected contact for.

439
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:20,580
Ed Hartwick : This case well wait no it's not really contact is more of a case if we get a case in resolving from the case and say lab result comes back in for somebody and it makes a case in the morning.

440
01:05:20,580 --> 01:05:29,340
Ed Hartwick : And the the it has like say an email address and a phone number that came in off of the electronic lab.

441
01:05:29,340 --> 01:05:41,100
Ed Hartwick : It can be marked to be sent out as a message to the person cell phone so we'll send it over to a contracted company that we have called patient education genius.

442
01:05:41,100 --> 01:05:53,400
Ed Hartwick : And they will take the phone number in the email address and contact the person and say Okay, here we you know know that you have had.

443
01:05:53,400 --> 01:06:01,650
Ed Hartwick : You know, a positive result for coven here are some follow up questions that local health department, would like to ask you and it's really kind of.

444
01:06:01,650 --> 01:06:04,410
Ed Hartwick : A lot of stuff that would be.

445
01:06:04,410 --> 01:06:15,750
Ed Hartwick : asked to the person when say a contact tracer or a case investigator would call them and follow up with them so it's like Oh, you know you know what kind of.

446
01:06:15,750 --> 01:06:25,710
Ed Hartwick : contacts have you had over the last several days to you know you have body aches you have fever chills you know what are your symptoms all that kind of stuff.

447
01:06:25,710 --> 01:06:36,390
Ed Hartwick : And then, it puts it in a format that you know the person can you know quickly get through through a web survey and then submit that back into the system, the system, then kind of.

448
01:06:36,390 --> 01:06:40,710
Ed Hartwick : Make sure that it gets all the information that has and leaves it there, you know.

449
01:06:40,710 --> 01:06:51,240
Ed Hartwick : For some updates, for you know, a day or so and then it'll send that information back into the DSS where it will populate the the case report form the idea here is that.

450
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:58,290
Ed Hartwick : We can quickly outreach to a lot of people without having to spend any human time.

451
01:06:58,290 --> 01:07:06,930
Ed Hartwick : Making calls and if there is information that's you know say if they reached out to the person that never responded or.

452
01:07:06,930 --> 01:07:19,020
Ed Hartwick : If it's an incomplete thing and then they need to feel to feel that they need to to follow up more they can get Ahold of the person and say you know okay well hey we saw that you had have fill this out, but we have some follow up questions we'd like to ask you.

453
01:07:19,020 --> 01:07:25,890
Ed Hartwick : And really kind of can save a lot of people, a lot of time, so it's something that we're hoping to use more.

454
01:07:25,890 --> 01:07:33,420
Ed Hartwick : But I think is kind of the the one of the limitations may be that if.

455
01:07:33,420 --> 01:07:44,310
Ed Hartwick : If we are to us like say the text messaging option of this it's I do believe that as an opt in option, where we could email people but not maybe text them so.

456
01:07:44,310 --> 01:07:55,950
Ed Hartwick : i'm sure other conditions so um so yeah it's kind of like you know got a lot of new things that are coming in through and interfacing, especially as kind of the the big thing.

457
01:07:55,950 --> 01:08:15,090
Ed Hartwick : With us going forward as well um I see probably trying to interface more with some other states systems as well if we had if we find information that would be useful for case infects investigators as well, so we're always kind of open for options as well, so.

458
01:08:15,090 --> 01:08:17,760
Ed Hartwick : All right.

459
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:25,830
Ed Hartwick : Now, I think that we're we're kind of on with us, as well as this kind of MDS as a surveillance platform.

460
01:08:25,830 --> 01:08:33,330
Ed Hartwick : And this could get mostly kind of moves into a kind of a shared services aspect we do have a portal page on the MDS now.

461
01:08:33,330 --> 01:08:41,250
Ed Hartwick : Where you know initially when we started with the MDS it was all about communicable disease surveillance.

462
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:51,720
Ed Hartwick : That when we expanded to actually include outbreak management, it was kind of its own system in a way, and didn't it didn't really have a good spot within the MDS itself.

463
01:08:51,720 --> 01:09:04,230
Ed Hartwick : And so we ended up creating this portal page where you land there and say okay well, you want to go into on as you want to go into MDS and it made that kind of a real simple there and then as.

464
01:09:04,230 --> 01:09:07,170
Ed Hartwick : He found his other systems.

465
01:09:07,170 --> 01:09:15,390
Ed Hartwick : and other you know program areas that didn't necessarily fit inside of communicable disease i'm wanting to expand.

466
01:09:15,390 --> 01:09:24,750
Ed Hartwick : and get into more into electronic surveillance as well there's kind of the base cost that comes with a lot of these things to it comes with the you know server acquisition.

467
01:09:24,750 --> 01:09:38,520
Ed Hartwick : which you know doesn't necessarily isn't as expensive as it used to be just because you know a lot of stuff is can be done in cloud environments and and and like there, but there is kind of a base hosting still that has to happen.

468
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:53,820
Ed Hartwick : So we found that you know, even though maybe like opioid surveillance might not necessarily fit in with communicable diseases on its own it's still could kind of fit into the same platform, and so we did kind of like on mass kind of carved out an area.

469
01:09:53,820 --> 01:10:04,230
Ed Hartwick : On that you know kind of portal page for opioid surveillance and of course it kind of it worked in with a certain service management which is definitely related to.

470
01:10:04,230 --> 01:10:08,820
Ed Hartwick : communicable disease as a lot of that is hepatitis C related.

471
01:10:08,820 --> 01:10:20,190
Ed Hartwick : And so we end up making a component there for that as well, and then, as we moved in to getting some more diverse methods of getting electronic messaging.

472
01:10:20,190 --> 01:10:25,830
Ed Hartwick : we've also opened up for csv uploads and, of course, chronic conditions is one that's coming up as well soon.

473
01:10:25,830 --> 01:10:41,100
Ed Hartwick : And like I mentioned this allows for a lot of shared platform environment stuff to reduce costs and it's also kind of the beginnings of what we're looking at as a micro services architecture that we're going to be moving to probably in the not so far future.

474
01:10:41,100 --> 01:10:49,020
Ed Hartwick : Like I mentioned real benefits come across from sharing hosting costs and keeping things down like that the drawbacks are, though, is like.

475
01:10:49,020 --> 01:10:58,620
Ed Hartwick : You know you got to make sure that you've got enough room inside of your system to be able to handle all these items that may or may not be competing for for space, so you got to make sure that you know.

476
01:10:58,620 --> 01:11:12,510
Ed Hartwick : On the back end your resources are allocated appropriately so it's not cause conflicts, I mean you don't want the the opioid system to be brought down, because the fact you're you're being hit hard by code.

477
01:11:12,510 --> 01:11:20,280
Ed Hartwick : And then you know system maintenance outages are going to affect everything that hits that system so.

478
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:32,400
Ed Hartwick : You know, especially for like say oh os updates and stuff like that, so they do have a lot of shared outages like a good thing is is most these things would have to happen anyway so it's not easily all that bad.

479
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:35,100
Ed Hartwick : This is a this kind of is.

480
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:42,930
Ed Hartwick : kind of a throwback tour which what we were originally talking about a lot with moving from paper to to to.

481
01:11:42,930 --> 01:11:46,710
Ed Hartwick : Electronic and this is really kind of a it's an early.

482
01:11:46,710 --> 01:11:53,370
Ed Hartwick : graph of you know what was happening before and after the introduction of the MDS s and you really kind of see that whole.

483
01:11:53,370 --> 01:12:09,480
Ed Hartwick : You know meeting number of days from the time of onset and referral it's really kind of proves the point that we all know of you know i've tried transmissions of things being a lot faster than then paper transmissions and you know this was a.

484
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:16,080
Ed Hartwick : This is a graphic you know it, it I don't imagine that this has actually gotten farther down.

485
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:29,280
Ed Hartwick : Over the years, it may have actually gone a little bit farther down as, as you know, even hospital systems and electronic laboratories have taken up, but uh I also think it's kind of interesting to kind of have thrown in here.

486
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:38,850
Ed Hartwick : As well in in in top of here to see kind of you know even upping the amount of demographic information that we know about patients.

487
01:12:38,850 --> 01:12:53,790
Ed Hartwick : Where you had like 70% of missing demographics before and after the system came about and how even that just alone made things a lot better for knowing about your pain.

488
01:12:53,790 --> 01:12:57,030
Okay sorry into cough again.

489
01:12:57,030 --> 01:12:58,530
Right.

490
01:12:58,530 --> 01:13:06,690
Ed Hartwick : um but with that, too, I also kind of wanted to throw in with these system usage statistics.

491
01:13:06,690 --> 01:13:20,670
Ed Hartwick : Because, as you can see, you know as the years have gone by we've just steadily gotten busier and busier inside the system what you're looking at here is kind of the number of case reports into the system, which is a blue lines in the case reports represent.

492
01:13:20,670 --> 01:13:27,780
Ed Hartwick : Excuse me um the, the number of cases that we actually had in the system for that year.

493
01:13:27,780 --> 01:13:30,960
Ed Hartwick : And the red line above it kind of reference.

494
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:36,750
Ed Hartwick : References the case referrals and those would be the, the number of times that we were told about cases.

495
01:13:36,750 --> 01:13:46,740
Ed Hartwick : So obviously you want your referrals are going to be higher than the case reports because you're going to end up with some duplication, but, as you can see, even the jump between 2007 and 2008.

496
01:13:46,740 --> 01:13:54,270
Ed Hartwick : These become wider and they become wider, because the fact that we do end up with more diverse centers, and so we get a lot of repeat information.

497
01:13:54,270 --> 01:14:05,280
Ed Hartwick : it's not necessarily bad, they also see that you know these trend lines are moving up and I don't believe that they're necessarily moving up because we're seeing more disease in the in the in the.

498
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:18,300
Ed Hartwick : In the state, but rather we're better capturing the amount of disease that is happening within the state of the black line you're looking at his database transactions and database transactions.

499
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:20,250
Ed Hartwick : It.

500
01:14:20,250 --> 01:14:27,510
Ed Hartwick : It refers really to the times the submit button or hidden in the database when something is committed into the database itself.

501
01:14:27,510 --> 01:14:42,150
Ed Hartwick : And you're seeing that you know kind of that that that general gradual trend and increasing use of the system, and you see this kind of jump up in 2014 between 2014 and 2015 and this one's kind of interesting on its own.

502
01:14:42,150 --> 01:14:51,150
Ed Hartwick : 2014 was kind of the pivotal year of meaningful use and they kind of give a little history on that.

503
01:14:51,150 --> 01:15:10,230
Ed Hartwick : When the high tech Act and the American the affordable care act passed in 2009 one of the components was that the the hospitals had to hospitals have participated in medicaid and medicare had to send a.

504
01:15:10,230 --> 01:15:19,350
Ed Hartwick : send messages, be able to send electronic messages that were of meaningful use the public health departments, and so we kind of shorten that up to say it's called just meaningful use Program.

505
01:15:19,350 --> 01:15:38,010
Ed Hartwick : The idea is that we really they were really pushing emr at that point for for the hospitals to get into and they kind of did a carrot and stick methodology you got would get a bonus on your medicare and medicaid.

506
01:15:38,010 --> 01:15:49,410
Ed Hartwick : Allowances if you went and what you needed to deplete for meaningful use early in the early was before 2014 so they gave them kind of five years to do it.

507
01:15:49,410 --> 01:15:54,570
Ed Hartwick : At 2014 if you were working on meaningful use at 2014 your.

508
01:15:54,570 --> 01:16:03,960
Ed Hartwick : Your funding level after 2014 However, you would start to see penalties and your medicare funding, and so what you saw.

509
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:06,570
Ed Hartwick : Is that we saw a steady increase in.

510
01:16:06,570 --> 01:16:14,340
Ed Hartwick : In people wanting to be able to send us electronic messages between 2010 and 2014.

511
01:16:14,340 --> 01:16:31,140
Ed Hartwick : But in 2014 everybody was busted down our door, to make sure that they did not lose money so and that's where you kind of see this giant jumping database transactions, because we did have a significant increase in electronic senders those years.

512
01:16:31,140 --> 01:16:36,840
Ed Hartwick : And with that you can kind of see that same thing and the electronic messaging reports themselves.

513
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:50,310
Ed Hartwick : So you see kind of that the were scraping by you know almost nothing from commercial labs or hospitals, most of our our stuff comes from the public health labs and then 2000 789 up.

514
01:16:50,310 --> 01:17:02,190
Ed Hartwick : You see that that commercial and especially the hospital numbers getting much, much wider and that's all because of the ICA and the high tech act.

515
01:17:02,190 --> 01:17:07,140
Ed Hartwick : Which is a lot of people, you know commonly one referring to as obamacare.

516
01:17:07,140 --> 01:17:20,520
Ed Hartwick : In my opinion, is kind of the unsung hero of of obamacare is the the fact that pulled a lot of the health systems kicking and screaming into the 21st century 10 years later, so.

517
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:27,210
Ed Hartwick : Another item to with an electronic messaging and the one thing I should say mentioned on this you'll notice the graph goes only at the.

518
01:17:27,210 --> 01:17:35,790
Ed Hartwick : And that really kind of allows us some more definition, because in 2019 we did make a change to the.

519
01:17:35,790 --> 01:17:52,410
Ed Hartwick : To the reporting systems and it actually kind of doubled our reports for that year in 2018 we made a negative hepatitis C results reportable Michigan and the idea, then was because we wanted to be able to catch it because.

520
01:17:52,410 --> 01:17:55,740
Ed Hartwick : hepatitis C finally kind of had a cure.

521
01:17:55,740 --> 01:18:06,090
Ed Hartwick : We have the ability, people have the ability to clear it with with medication, and so we wanted to be able to capture if there was any real effect re infections after that clearing.

522
01:18:06,090 --> 01:18:14,250
Ed Hartwick : But in order to be able to tell that you have to get negative lab reports and so that's really where you see the jump in our in our reporting.

523
01:18:14,250 --> 01:18:24,870
Ed Hartwick : hepatitis C went probably from number, you know, two or three in the amount of labs that we received two by far the number one condition, when you see you see blab score.

524
01:18:24,870 --> 01:18:40,890
Ed Hartwick : And it came to actually in such a quantity that we and we knew it was gonna be a big deal with it we actually created a way to deal with negative labs inside the system without creating cases, because if you had you know.

525
01:18:40,890 --> 01:18:48,810
Ed Hartwick : They have a case created in the system for every single negative lab you'd end up just overwhelming local public health.

526
01:18:48,810 --> 01:18:57,270
Ed Hartwick : So we ended up creating any On top of that, the majority of these negative labs are people who had never had hepatitis C or never will have it.

527
01:18:57,270 --> 01:19:10,050
Ed Hartwick : Because it was part of the health Regiment and then screening was recommended for all people, you know board and before the age of or before I think before and before like 1975 or something like that.

528
01:19:10,050 --> 01:19:13,500
Ed Hartwick : That might be a little bit off on the timing, but maybe a 65.

529
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:22,590
Ed Hartwick : but either way and it's become it became kind of the health maintenance issue for a lot of folks, and so we were going to get a lot of people who would never be seen in the system.

530
01:19:22,590 --> 01:19:31,710
Ed Hartwick : So we constructed a part, an area in the MDS called the lab holding area in which negative hepatitis C results would live.

531
01:19:31,710 --> 01:19:39,960
Ed Hartwick : If they can be matched out to a person who had a case in the system, they could be emerged out and the negative would show up there.

532
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:53,220
Ed Hartwick : Otherwise it'd be held in the system for a year and, after a year, they would be deleted the idea behind that is that we could also in a kind of seeing when a person became positives.

533
01:19:53,220 --> 01:20:05,040
Ed Hartwick : For hepatitis C as well, so if you had an they were part of their health, maintenance, they would be tested for Pepsi say back in April and then come August there now positive for Pepsi.

534
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:15,690
Ed Hartwick : You know that that is an acute case it's an it's a brand new case of hepatitis C, that person was infected and you could do it public health response that is is different.

535
01:20:15,690 --> 01:20:22,230
Ed Hartwick : So i'm super helpful public health response tool so.

536
01:20:22,230 --> 01:20:31,560
Ed Hartwick : But in if you're trying to compare year to year, and how your statistics are for electronic messaging and kind of there was a little bit of a monkey wrench in there for you so.

537
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:36,960
Ed Hartwick : But then, with that i'll kind of start into electronic messaging as well.

538
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:44,010
Ed Hartwick : And, before I get into I want to make sure that we don't have any other questions or anything that the folks might have about.

539
01:20:44,010 --> 01:20:47,280
This right now.

540
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:50,790
Kevin John Dombkowski: I don't see any questions at this point.

541
01:20:50,790 --> 01:21:08,400
Ed Hartwick : Alright, great so um with that I do want because I know I have been kind of referring to electronic messaging and and talking around it, for a good chunk of the beginning of the year um but really it's kind of it's now a lot of times become kind of our bread and butter.

542
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:19,260
Ed Hartwick : We when the system started, we really had almost no electronic messaging I think our first Center was actually the state public health lab and they.

543
01:21:19,260 --> 01:21:24,390
Ed Hartwick : You know they started, I believe the same year, the system launch was was.

544
01:21:24,390 --> 01:21:32,130
Ed Hartwick : But they were you know, one of our few so they were like the only Center we had, for the first couple of years and then we added a few of the larger.

545
01:21:32,130 --> 01:21:38,130
Ed Hartwick : Public Health lab and that public health wise but larger commercial labs like lab core and mail.

546
01:21:38,130 --> 01:21:50,880
Ed Hartwick : An Arab pretty soon afterwards and then, but by 2009 when ACTA and high tech we're past we had only had to.

547
01:21:50,880 --> 01:22:01,890
Ed Hartwick : You know hospital labs that we're even sending to us, and so the majority of our messages back then were there were boys majority of our cases were hand entered back then.

548
01:22:01,890 --> 01:22:10,980
Ed Hartwick : Either way, the messaging standard that we use currently is the ahl seven 2.5 message standard, it was the one it is the one that was prescribed in.

549
01:22:10,980 --> 01:22:29,580
Ed Hartwick : In in the meaningful use regulations it's actually there is a thing a few standards and nhl 72 that are beyond that, but really not not that much I think they I think they might be up to 2.8 or so right now.

550
01:22:29,580 --> 01:22:40,500
Ed Hartwick : But really nobody's moving beyond to five until probably the government regulates that are recommends that they removed.

551
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:53,040
Ed Hartwick : It also hl seven as a messaging standard is used across public health and inside of hospitals as well, are the or us or or the the lab.

552
01:22:53,040 --> 01:23:05,880
Ed Hartwick : messages that we receive they usually will lab results at team messages are used for syndrome system, which is our, which is also there the admin discharge and transfer messages.

553
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:11,580
Ed Hartwick : You see that a lot with you know hospital admissions and discharges as well.

554
01:23:11,580 --> 01:23:17,970
Ed Hartwick : Inside So those are used, especially inside of the health healthcare systems themselves.

555
01:23:17,970 --> 01:23:22,980
Ed Hartwick : And then they'll be X you messages which are the messages that are the vaccine.

556
01:23:22,980 --> 01:23:26,280
Ed Hartwick : messages to us to us by the MIC here.

557
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:39,840
Ed Hartwick : there's other other message standards or other message profiles out there and other than these three, but these are kind of the three that have big for public health right down, we also have electronic case reports.

558
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:49,380
Ed Hartwick : The these are kind of in the new piece right now they've been around for a while, but they're looking at really.

559
01:23:49,380 --> 01:24:01,200
Ed Hartwick : it's it's it's we're nhl seven to five message or an or you message is a message from a limb sewer system about a specific lab results.

560
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:15,960
Ed Hartwick : and ECR is a kind of a broader picture of a person's health history that's pulled out of a an electronic health system, then ehr or or the or whatever hospital system they happen to be using.

561
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:24,390
Ed Hartwick : These are often in nhl seven CDA format they're also using fire there's two two different ECR.

562
01:24:24,390 --> 01:24:32,460
Ed Hartwick : Standards out there for this right now, one CDA and one is fire CDA effectively hl seven version three.

563
01:24:32,460 --> 01:24:34,560
Ed Hartwick : And so.

564
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:41,430
Ed Hartwick : We are receiving a handful of these, but really the the push from medicare and medicaid.

565
01:24:41,430 --> 01:24:45,570
Ed Hartwick : To do CDA and ECR and fire.

566
01:24:45,570 --> 01:24:51,360
Ed Hartwick : has really come within the last year, and so I think we're going to see it kind of take off over the next couple of years.

567
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:59,490
Ed Hartwick : we're getting a lot of pushing a lot of pressure from CDC to to work with, especially with the larger hospital systems that would be able to handle these.

568
01:24:59,490 --> 01:25:07,590
Ed Hartwick : The, it is very software dependent and as well i'm near in order to be able to produce a new car, you are going to need in.

569
01:25:07,590 --> 01:25:15,300
Ed Hartwick : An ehr, that is, is capable of doing that there's a I know there's a handful two or three that are.

570
01:25:15,300 --> 01:25:27,660
Ed Hartwick : You know kind of the well known, ones that are able to do it, I imagine there's more than probably there aren't really as well advertised, and probably a bit more affordable they're able to do as well, so um.

571
01:25:27,660 --> 01:25:36,870
Ed Hartwick : But yeah the idea, there is that, where you know, an nhl seven to five message would be able to tell us the person who salmonella that the the ahl.

572
01:25:36,870 --> 01:25:44,880
Ed Hartwick : This ECR might be able to tell us well okay well yeah they have salmonella but here's the highest temperature that they had.

573
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:53,730
Ed Hartwick : When they were in the hospital they're currently in an Inpatient they had been here at X number of days, and you know here's the medications that we have used to treat it.

574
01:25:53,730 --> 01:26:06,660
Ed Hartwick : So that kind of extra information can save a few phone calls and certainly not only save the investigators time but also be able to give us a lot more complete data early on and investigations.

575
01:26:06,660 --> 01:26:13,410
Ed Hartwick : With all of these though of course establishing standards is a key to being able to adopt them.

576
01:26:13,410 --> 01:26:25,890
Ed Hartwick : Not only with hl seven to five, you know 10 years ago, but also with the ACR one of the biggest things that we had heard when ECR was is kind of in its infancy even was.

577
01:26:25,890 --> 01:26:35,850
Ed Hartwick : Complaints about the way we had about some of the seven experiences that we had back in for for labs.

578
01:26:35,850 --> 01:26:36,660
Ed Hartwick : One of the things.

579
01:26:36,660 --> 01:26:43,500
Ed Hartwick : That you have I mean you'd have a lot of each State would end up with its own implementation guide for.

580
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:47,340
Ed Hartwick : Based upon their surveillance systems needs.

581
01:26:47,340 --> 01:26:58,140
Ed Hartwick : And I mean we try to keep as much as we could to the national guidance of it and the national guidance tried to say you know, keep us as much as they are to the middle of the road, what everybody else needed.

582
01:26:58,140 --> 01:27:02,580
Ed Hartwick : But there were still some things some things that we require that we're necessarily required in there.

583
01:27:02,580 --> 01:27:07,620
Ed Hartwick : And you'd find that a lot of times, especially larger software vendors would only build the national requirements.

584
01:27:07,620 --> 01:27:14,610
Ed Hartwick : And therefore, getting some sort of more state specific requirements would be a lot more difficult would cost hospitals money.

585
01:27:14,610 --> 01:27:30,540
Ed Hartwick : That kind of thing, and so there was a lot of complaints about that, so one of the big things that have been trying to push with ECR is like standardization across the country on that kind of thing and i'm hoping that that will also lead to a higher rate of adoption in general amongst.

586
01:27:30,540 --> 01:27:35,190
Ed Hartwick : You know healthcare systems and i'm not gonna hold my breath, though.

587
01:27:35,190 --> 01:27:50,220
Ed Hartwick : A lot of these places don't want to put the effort into it unless they're forced to but you know as within any standards as well they're they're all the processes always slow we've all we've already been working on ACR probably for four or five years at least.

588
01:27:50,220 --> 01:27:54,870
Ed Hartwick : And you know it still feels like it's in its infancy so.

589
01:27:54,870 --> 01:28:00,840
Ed Hartwick : This is kind of what you'd see inside of the MDS in a an electronic.

590
01:28:00,840 --> 01:28:09,360
Ed Hartwick : The a lot of these are triggered based upon Wigan sno MED coatings that are inside of the system, the lymph system itself.

591
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:22,380
Ed Hartwick : And, or you know, sometimes they're also triggered based upon local codes, but in the end, what we need, and what we ask of them so they send linkedin sno MED, because they are kind of the national standard that call called out and meaningful use.

592
01:28:22,380 --> 01:28:30,420
Ed Hartwick : And all that kind of business, the idea, there is that we can have a code and use those codes then to automatically assign conditions.

593
01:28:30,420 --> 01:28:38,430
Ed Hartwick : That they're using a look code, I mean they've seen this a lot to do with coven you'll say somebody else in like covert ag well.

594
01:28:38,430 --> 01:28:46,680
Ed Hartwick : You can see from the words covert ag that they've been it's a coven antigen but you know we didn't have that it's not a standard code.

595
01:28:46,680 --> 01:29:01,260
Ed Hartwick : A line code and those cases might be something along the lines of you know 94564 dash three you know in fact probably the one of the more common coven PCR codes is nine four or 500 dash six and.

596
01:29:01,260 --> 01:29:14,880
Ed Hartwick : it's that one's kind of Nice because this is an easier, one for me to remember and, if I have to sweep tweaking a messages coming in and put it into the right code it's a it's an easy one to just quickly type out.

597
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:18,900
Ed Hartwick : We do any of our conditions or any of our.

598
01:29:18,900 --> 01:29:26,940
Ed Hartwick : assignments in the system, we would like to just do it simply based on Lincoln sno MED on its own.

599
01:29:26,940 --> 01:29:36,390
Ed Hartwick : But you know we end up having to do some local codes, because we do know that some sites are just not technically able to do things the way we want them to.

600
01:29:36,390 --> 01:29:46,050
Ed Hartwick : But, in general I think those they work out well the the the very simplified way with snow men and women that i've always kind of remembered it too is like is.

601
01:29:46,050 --> 01:30:02,580
Ed Hartwick : Often the test code snowman snowman is often the result code so that's kind of it's a very overly simplified in some ways incorrect, but you know nine times out of 10 that's kind of where they're going to land.

602
01:30:02,580 --> 01:30:20,850
Ed Hartwick : The information that comes in these reports, and then we kind of mentioned to be will will have just about everything you need usually it has all the contact info that the the site has about them so often if if the contact info isn't included it's usually because the lab in that habit.

603
01:30:20,850 --> 01:30:26,010
Ed Hartwick : In Michigan there's not really much of an excuse for a lab not to have it, but.

604
01:30:26,010 --> 01:30:35,190
Ed Hartwick : You know, in general, over the last few years, the data quality on a lot of this stuff has gotten a lot better but um you know it can happen to.

605
01:30:35,190 --> 01:30:42,750
Ed Hartwick : But it does consider that the contact info for the patient and also the of the the referring physician so in case we do have to call the physician and say.

606
01:30:42,750 --> 01:30:53,070
Ed Hartwick : Alright, this lab looks a little weird what's can give us some history on it, or we don't have a phone number for this person, do you have a phone number for this person that kind of thing.

607
01:30:53,070 --> 01:31:08,070
Ed Hartwick : And also can communicate to other stuff and you know, such as notes and comments and pregnancy status, you know reference ranges all the kind of stuff so it really kind of super you know information filled format.

608
01:31:08,070 --> 01:31:17,340
Ed Hartwick : In here to i'm kind of give a give a message flow of how things happen in the end DSS the items in white over here is really kind of what's done.

609
01:31:17,340 --> 01:31:24,180
Ed Hartwick : In electronically, and the systems at the state, so you know, the onus on said person goes to the doctor.

610
01:31:24,180 --> 01:31:32,760
Ed Hartwick : or physician could just call them know local public health and they could go along the lines of investigating and putting into the MDS and etc.

611
01:31:32,760 --> 01:31:39,300
Ed Hartwick : But a lot of times what happens is then they'll take a lab the lab was enough, you know they'll send a sample a little lab.

612
01:31:39,300 --> 01:31:59,760
Ed Hartwick : The person's test positive and then they're sent through HR information or HR us health information exchanges which is kind of our yellow area here into the state which is going and where you see the blue items here the the blue items or the the message processing in the state.

613
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:03,930
Ed Hartwick : you'll see it comes into our hub.

614
01:32:03,930 --> 01:32:10,830
Ed Hartwick : Our message hub, and then sent often to make sure that the message is standardized and formatted correctly.

615
01:32:10,830 --> 01:32:15,180
Ed Hartwick : We look at the incoming message type.

616
01:32:15,180 --> 01:32:29,490
Ed Hartwick : Based upon the link and sno MED codes and then really at that point, like an early call on what the condition is is made, and it says, and you know that determines where the route is so like say, for instance.

617
01:32:29,490 --> 01:32:43,500
Ed Hartwick : You know this kind of path runs for a lot of things it runs for lead it runs for HIV, it runs for communicable diseases in general, and you know some systems have their own specific system that's not the MDS s.

618
01:32:43,500 --> 01:32:51,690
Ed Hartwick : So they'll end up you know it'll end up routing based upon that so if a lead message comes in and says, this is the lead code, yes, is the lead could send it over to the lead system.

619
01:32:51,690 --> 01:33:00,870
Ed Hartwick : Is this an HIV message well MDS so the primary condition or primary system for HIV so send it over to HIV LM s.

620
01:33:00,870 --> 01:33:10,110
Ed Hartwick : And then pretty much a lot of the other stuff that's leverage based does come here, you know heavy metals has their own system as well.

621
01:33:10,110 --> 01:33:12,660
Ed Hartwick : Sorry, excuse me um.

622
01:33:12,660 --> 01:33:22,710
Ed Hartwick : And then you know everything else needs to is a CD they'll go on the spss jurisdiction as a sign and then from here that's where the local public health is notified.

623
01:33:22,710 --> 01:33:42,150
Ed Hartwick : This may be a quick quicker but doesn't often happen this route here the it almost always depends upon how long it takes for the test to get run after the test results come in the the process from here to here is usually.

624
01:33:42,150 --> 01:33:42,750
Kevin John Dombkowski: You know.

625
01:33:42,750 --> 01:33:46,770
Ed Hartwick : A matter of minutes.

626
01:33:46,770 --> 01:33:59,160
Ed Hartwick : So that kind of thing happens and then, of course, the only investigation happens at the local public health area they complete the case in the system and that's an offer yeah to CDC so.

627
01:33:59,160 --> 01:34:10,380
Ed Hartwick : Of course this is kind of when I talk about the the the hub information here we haven't run through a system called rhapsody that's a software really.

628
01:34:10,380 --> 01:34:19,050
Ed Hartwick : And this is kind of one of the the Messier algorithms of how this happens is kind of an er route.

629
01:34:19,050 --> 01:34:27,960
Ed Hartwick : As as its kind of charted out inside the system where it comes in, it has a look at like okay well whoops sorry.

630
01:34:27,960 --> 01:34:45,990
Ed Hartwick : Okay, we got the er router here is the lab core is it mail is a class Okay, then send it all on different set of rules based upon things that have to be done to the message, and then you know send it out to the system itself when it's done, you know, having it's.

631
01:34:45,990 --> 01:34:57,630
Ed Hartwick : Having the system kind of clean up the message itself that's an overload older route this isn't even actually one we use anymore, but it kind of gives an idea of all the kind of.

632
01:34:57,630 --> 01:35:05,460
Ed Hartwick : The meat grinder that these things kind of run through in order to get into the system correctly so.

633
01:35:05,460 --> 01:35:11,010
Ed Hartwick : Right and then here, I have an example of kind of a human readable version of an ECR.

634
01:35:11,010 --> 01:35:13,620
Ed Hartwick : And like I had said before.

635
01:35:13,620 --> 01:35:19,860
Ed Hartwick : This is kind of it's got a lot of information on the person itself here that the hospital would have.

636
01:35:19,860 --> 01:35:29,820
Ed Hartwick : it's got information about the encounter when the diagnosis, was what the diagnosis is you know you'll have a history of any type of present illness and there's a result sections of labs.

637
01:35:29,820 --> 01:35:39,120
Ed Hartwick : You know kind of the reason for businesses or the person say showed up because of a cough or something like that they might have that listed in there and medications that the person has.

638
01:35:39,120 --> 01:35:43,650
Ed Hartwick : Nothing kind of other information that would be stored in this kind of bit here.

639
01:35:43,650 --> 01:36:02,760
Ed Hartwick : As it sits inside the MDS so this one actually as an attachment that you'll have to go and look at here for the long run plan is to have all of this information brought actually into the case report forms in the system to be able to follow up on so.

640
01:36:02,760 --> 01:36:09,900
Ed Hartwick : Okay, and then one thing I mentioned to on this was health information exchanges, these are kind of.

641
01:36:09,900 --> 01:36:21,690
Ed Hartwick : You know kind of the backbone of getting the information to us because it's like if you are hospital and you want to send information to the State it's not like you just dial up our IP, and so this is an email or whatever.

642
01:36:21,690 --> 01:36:35,220
Ed Hartwick : You, we have to have you know secure connections that are maintained properly over over my time is troubleshooting trouble shot, because you know these things, and never are 100% stable.

643
01:36:35,220 --> 01:36:45,960
Ed Hartwick : So what we developed for these health kind of health information exchanges was we we kind of call the Michigan model it's really a hub and spoke model where you have.

644
01:36:45,960 --> 01:37:01,410
Ed Hartwick : You know healthcare providers that can shop around and and you know go to a sub state health information exchange there's kind of a smaller kind of on board, you know gateway alpha information exchange.

645
01:37:01,410 --> 01:37:08,910
Ed Hartwick : But they'll they'll offer different packages, or whatever between different places it's kind of a competitive market, then, and then.

646
01:37:08,910 --> 01:37:20,910
Ed Hartwick : And then offer different feature incident services for information as well, and then those people can connect to those and then those sub state ha's will then.

647
01:37:20,910 --> 01:37:28,200
Ed Hartwick : Send up to kind of the hub, which is the Michigan health information network or my hand.

648
01:37:28,200 --> 01:37:40,290
Ed Hartwick : And then my hand will then kind of route any messages to where they need to go do they know to go to a different sub state, because if the person is transferring from one hospital to another or they need to go to the state.

649
01:37:40,290 --> 01:37:44,580
Ed Hartwick : And you know kind of this is kind of an example.

650
01:37:44,580 --> 01:37:56,040
Ed Hartwick : can have that kind of thing before you have an hie every every hospital is making having to make an individual connection to each system, this is a lot to manage even on on the system side.

651
01:37:56,040 --> 01:38:06,120
Ed Hartwick : Where when we get into HIV topology this is kind of what we're seeing here is where you have you know the individual hospitals and providers connects to a sub state those sub state cannot deny him.

652
01:38:06,120 --> 01:38:13,320
Ed Hartwick : And then my hand can handle that writings from hospital a to provider your J they'll say okay well it's got to go to this substate on through here.

653
01:38:13,320 --> 01:38:24,690
Ed Hartwick : You need to send to the state, well then, my team will just send it into the state, the State itself acts like a sub state HIV in this kind of you know hub and spoke model now.

654
01:38:24,690 --> 01:38:33,930
Ed Hartwick : You know what that is kind of that network of networks, you know I use this term substate HIV and it's kind of an old term I don't even know if it's really used anymore.

655
01:38:33,930 --> 01:38:42,270
Ed Hartwick : They use it for a while they call them qualified organization, I think the last time I went to the my hand website, they just refer to them as HIV.

656
01:38:42,270 --> 01:38:52,530
Ed Hartwick : And so you know, over the years, you know these this model has kind of persistent and it stayed in with this, you know kind of at least from our respect kind of that stayed the same.

657
01:38:52,530 --> 01:39:06,090
Ed Hartwick : Though it has changed, I mean the the number and types of H is or i've changed, some have emerged with others, some have you know gone out of business, they didn't quite make it.

658
01:39:06,090 --> 01:39:18,630
Ed Hartwick : And that kind of thing, but the the idea in the end is that the individual providers will connect with one of these sub states, and then they connect through my centralized network to get to other ones that they need to.

659
01:39:18,630 --> 01:39:25,110
Ed Hartwick : Now, like I mentioned there's there's 13 know sub States they originally kind of started.

660
01:39:25,110 --> 01:39:32,940
Ed Hartwick : In the mid 2000s as regional health information organizations are rio's that term is like very antiquated now.

661
01:39:32,940 --> 01:39:34,890
Ed Hartwick : But you know.

662
01:39:34,890 --> 01:39:45,210
Ed Hartwick : Effectively, the model and one of the things that's really kind of changing the model recently as one of the larger substate H is an emerging with my hand.

663
01:39:45,210 --> 01:40:02,490
Ed Hartwick : This year, and so my head now is Donnelly, the hub, also an individual provider it kind of gives them a corner in the market, but you know I mean there's still stuff state agencies out there, so the model still persists.

664
01:40:02,490 --> 01:40:05,430
Ed Hartwick : interstate transmission.

665
01:40:05,430 --> 01:40:07,860
Ed Hartwick : When we're looking at.

666
01:40:07,860 --> 01:40:19,350
Ed Hartwick : A lot of interstate stuff I think the the original model I know my him still kind of sticks with this as they can is for the to connect to other state health information networks.

667
01:40:19,350 --> 01:40:27,930
Ed Hartwick : Now we have like say connections with my hand out to the machine and health information network which is kind of like Northern indiana type of thing.

668
01:40:27,930 --> 01:40:31,650
Ed Hartwick : I do know they have some other connections into some other places on that real.

669
01:40:31,650 --> 01:40:43,350
Ed Hartwick : up to date on everything that they connect to their but also there's a few other ways that we've done it we've done kind of some interest interstate transmission work groups stuff that wouldn't necessarily go through my hand.

670
01:40:43,350 --> 01:41:00,480
Ed Hartwick : Because you know, there is a cost involved with connecting to a sub state and so i'm we have where there's kind of like more of a national item called the aims hub, which was is kind of run by a php file.

671
01:41:00,480 --> 01:41:02,730
Ed Hartwick : It has kind of become.

672
01:41:02,730 --> 01:41:15,180
Ed Hartwick : Almost a de facto statewide or nationwide HIV, a lot of States will use that for interstate communications, some of the larger.

673
01:41:15,180 --> 01:41:31,680
Ed Hartwick : lab networks will use that as well, like say quest uses connections into aims to send all their state all of their data out individual states, because for them it's only just one connection, instead of having to set up like 50 some connections.

674
01:41:31,680 --> 01:41:44,910
Ed Hartwick : They make it a lot easier there, we also use that to transfer State to State so like we do have some direct connections with iowa Wisconsin and we do run it through aims.

675
01:41:44,910 --> 01:41:52,560
Ed Hartwick : All the future ones will be head through that in in kind of they're using that, as well as as a bit of a connection as well for.

676
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:58,920
Ed Hartwick : EC ours, because the idea, there is that you see ours will kind of can be distributed.

677
01:41:58,920 --> 01:42:01,860
Ed Hartwick : centrally through that kind of situation as well.

678
01:42:01,860 --> 01:42:23,190
Ed Hartwick : mom out there with that too, as the US digital services kind of new it seems to be really kind of to try and take up the official government mantle of being an HIV, but they do kind of do a lot of the same stuff of the Games have does but kind of under the the official Federal Government.

679
01:42:23,190 --> 01:42:27,750
kind of flag.

680
01:42:27,750 --> 01:42:32,790
Ed Hartwick : Right, I see one person stands up.

681
01:42:32,790 --> 01:42:34,890
Kevin John Dombkowski: So.

682
01:42:34,890 --> 01:42:40,740
Kevin John Dombkowski: One of the investigation or recording is like a concern case in that sense.

683
01:42:40,740 --> 01:42:48,780
Kevin John Dombkowski: So to those like automatically get sent out through like these interstate transmissions or is that something we have to do.

684
01:42:48,780 --> 01:43:05,130
Ed Hartwick : We not yet that's a interstate referrals right now, are our kind of tough like with the connections that we have with iowa and Wisconsin is really they're they're kind of lab for things so if we say.

685
01:43:05,130 --> 01:43:11,250
Ed Hartwick : say if Henry Ford hospital had a patient who's home address was in Wisconsin.

686
01:43:11,250 --> 01:43:17,250
Ed Hartwick : You know they're just visiting or whatever they had a cold, you know, whatever they had.

687
01:43:17,250 --> 01:43:22,710
Ed Hartwick : They sometimes they'll send they should technically just send it straight to Wisconsin.

688
01:43:22,710 --> 01:43:31,350
Ed Hartwick : And a lot of times they'll just send it to us and expect us to send it to Wisconsin so what we've done is is made it so that, if we get an electronic lab in.

689
01:43:31,350 --> 01:43:41,820
Ed Hartwick : For a person whose address is in Wisconsin we will automatically forward to Wisconsin we won't even touch it and we'll hit our systems that go straight to them.

690
01:43:41,820 --> 01:43:44,100
Ed Hartwick : And then.

691
01:43:44,100 --> 01:43:48,030
Ed Hartwick : they're doing the same thing for us, and the same goes for iowa.

692
01:43:48,030 --> 01:44:01,410
Ed Hartwick : Where we're working on connection to Florida for that kind of thing right now Ohio and indiana higher on the list to do that kind of thing as well, but right now it's just for that kind of thing now if somebody comes into the system.

693
01:44:01,410 --> 01:44:08,760
Ed Hartwick : And they have a machine address but it turns out that through investigation, the person that actually lives in Wisconsin.

694
01:44:08,760 --> 01:44:16,770
Ed Hartwick : We can't send through that methodology, yet the idea, though, in the long term, is that we would create an ECR.

695
01:44:16,770 --> 01:44:30,240
Ed Hartwick : and send that ECR, with all that case information that we do have for the person to Wisconsin through and ACR um but we haven't gotten to that point yet it's kind of one of our list of things to do.

696
01:44:30,240 --> 01:44:42,960
Ed Hartwick : So currently we do it the old fashioned way, which is we take all the cases that are listed as a state with addresses in different states export them on a system do mail merges the facts.

697
01:44:42,960 --> 01:44:44,700
Ed Hartwick : So.

698
01:44:44,700 --> 01:44:49,590
Ed Hartwick : faxes are still important to public health, unfortunately.

699
01:44:49,590 --> 01:44:53,550
Kevin John Dombkowski: But some of the labs do connect directly to stay.

700
01:44:53,550 --> 01:44:54,930
Ed Hartwick : Yes, and.

701
01:44:54,930 --> 01:45:03,300
Ed Hartwick : Then and that's the case to even like say with a virus is a good example of that aspirants network.

702
01:45:03,300 --> 01:45:09,690
Ed Hartwick : is based in Wisconsin but they have several hospitals in the western up and.

703
01:45:09,690 --> 01:45:19,020
Ed Hartwick : Those hospitals, we we signed up to have them send it electronically, to us, but at the same time, we said well hey why don't we make it so that if you guys at your reference lab.

704
01:45:19,020 --> 01:45:32,190
Ed Hartwick : And wausau want to send it straight to us, you could use the same methodology, they said that sounds like a great idea, so those guys actually do send to Wisconsin and to us so.

705
01:45:32,190 --> 01:45:34,020
Ed Hartwick : that's you know.

706
01:45:34,020 --> 01:45:46,800
Ed Hartwick : it's really kind of a great thing like that is, it gives me tickles when I when I think about how how that how so easily that can be done on and how we, we really need to be doing more of that kind of thing too.

707
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:50,280
So.

708
01:45:50,280 --> 01:45:52,980
Ed Hartwick : All right, i'm.

709
01:45:52,980 --> 01:46:09,570
Ed Hartwick : Implementation guides i'll just kind of kind of lightly touch on this one it's it's a they're they're really important than general because you really need to kind of lay you know drill down into sometimes in some of these things so as people understand what you really want.

710
01:46:09,570 --> 01:46:18,810
Ed Hartwick : One of our developers, who is a you know kind of computer science doctorate Dr Andre he says as it's got to be one of my favorite quotes.

711
01:46:18,810 --> 01:46:28,170
Ed Hartwick : This is everyone sends a chill 7251, but no one is sending the same version of hcl 7251 which is you know ironic because it's exactly the same version.

712
01:46:28,170 --> 01:46:37,320
Ed Hartwick : The problem is, though, is you'll end up with you know state variations and messages and and even inside of the guides themselves are so.

713
01:46:37,320 --> 01:46:42,120
Ed Hartwick : kind of loosened terminology that they leave a lot of room for interpretation.

714
01:46:42,120 --> 01:46:53,520
Ed Hartwick : Like say, for instance, like facility identifier some sites, want to send you know object ID or boys, we have always use the clean number because anybody sending.

715
01:46:53,520 --> 01:47:02,160
Ed Hartwick : A lab to us would have to be clia certified and so, therefore, they should have a clear number Tom and they would have always be unique.

716
01:47:02,160 --> 01:47:10,980
Ed Hartwick : um and then, of course, you know there's aspects that we consider a certain things required that might not mean be required in other states and that kind of business.

717
01:47:10,980 --> 01:47:18,720
Ed Hartwick : And that's really where your implementation guys really kind of nailed those things down here and here's kind of an example of that kind of thing right its own.

718
01:47:18,720 --> 01:47:33,330
Ed Hartwick : What we did when we made ours was we tried to really work it so that if we had a requirement that was different than the national standard that we made it kind of pop out in color wise and say, yes, this is a required field.

719
01:47:33,330 --> 01:47:49,440
Ed Hartwick : Because nationally, this was you know oops sorry and actually this here was like required, but could be empty we needed it to be a set to do this, because this is what we absolutely needed to be able to have messages routed to us.

720
01:47:49,440 --> 01:47:56,250
Ed Hartwick : And then you know other items here that, but these message guys, they also include the items.

721
01:47:56,250 --> 01:48:05,280
Ed Hartwick : That are you know, in general, you know kind of explanations of stuff for this, this is part of our syndrome a guy, by the way, because this is the MSS.

722
01:48:05,280 --> 01:48:16,080
Ed Hartwick : Which is our syndrome surveillance system and the ATT messages are the, these are the profiles that we would be able to accept for syndrome so.

723
01:48:16,080 --> 01:48:22,560
Ed Hartwick : let's see an example here, quick and I imagine that you probably have seen some hl seven messages.

724
01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:37,410
Ed Hartwick : Before, and this is gonna get two examples here this one, and the next one i'm kind of on how different these messages, can be like this would be coming out of this looks like it probably came out of a soft lab software.

725
01:48:37,410 --> 01:48:48,930
Ed Hartwick : A few years back, and we kind of tweaked it so that's you know the identified um but, as you can see, it contains a ton of information inside of some of us with someone we don't.

726
01:48:48,930 --> 01:48:58,470
Ed Hartwick : The important things to kind of know usually for for us when we are going through and say onboarding these sites is like say Ms H4 which is highlighted right here.

727
01:48:58,470 --> 01:49:08,760
Ed Hartwick : And you know okay this person's got it correctly, a number the tea and msha 11 that's for testing, so we know it's a test messages coming in.

728
01:49:08,760 --> 01:49:13,800
Ed Hartwick : you've got the person's name in there correctly, you can see the birthday sex.

729
01:49:13,800 --> 01:49:20,400
Ed Hartwick : here's their address right here phone number and that kind of like.

730
01:49:20,400 --> 01:49:31,560
Ed Hartwick : pb patient visit so stuff about the doctors or see about the about the order itself Ob are the order results, so they this is okay, this is the actual tests that they ordered.

731
01:49:31,560 --> 01:49:38,520
Ed Hartwick : they're looking for a specific this, and this, you know this is kind of one where we'd come back to them and say okay well look here you're using.

732
01:49:38,520 --> 01:49:46,110
Ed Hartwick : A local code and your test definitions, please use a link code there and then the results here and.

733
01:49:46,110 --> 01:49:56,400
Ed Hartwick : The same kind of thing and saying okay well you're using a local code here, and you say at the beginning that you're using a lawyer, but you don't actually have it filled out, so please fix that and then.

734
01:49:56,400 --> 01:50:10,560
Ed Hartwick : you'll see to that the the answers here and it's in plain text which Max matches your text type here so that's going to be okay, and then your specimen down here okay this isn't a cerebral spinal fluid but.

735
01:50:10,560 --> 01:50:27,300
Ed Hartwick : The local is not the the actual code set to be used here that should be an l if you're going to be using it in all honesty that should probably also be a sno MED so i'd be another piece of comment, we could give back to the person about the about their information.

736
01:50:27,300 --> 01:50:35,190
Ed Hartwick : Exactly here is on almost the same type of message, but a lot shorter a lot less detail.

737
01:50:35,190 --> 01:50:40,140
Ed Hartwick : And state by state really depends upon.

738
01:50:40,140 --> 01:50:55,680
Ed Hartwick : Whether or not, you know this is enough information for them or not here you're looking at basic the basic content up top you know just abbreviations This obviously is wrong here because it's the This is where they should be having a.

739
01:50:55,680 --> 01:51:11,490
Ed Hartwick : Clear number to be able to so we can identify it yes there's plenty of protection message so obviously this stage they probably should be turning test messages they are there they're sending the code correctly as a local code, but really this should be a link.

740
01:51:11,490 --> 01:51:18,600
Ed Hartwick : And then actually down here you'll see that all they actually are using the 68630 dash for.

741
01:51:18,600 --> 01:51:28,920
Ed Hartwick : It actually is a law in code, but they also marking it as a local code so maybe what they really just need a system update the system and say it's not just a local code it's a long code to and so.

742
01:51:28,920 --> 01:51:36,090
Ed Hartwick : In the end, you know, in the end, this may not exactly be reportable because there's no growth, I mean it's really just telling us that nothing happened.

743
01:51:36,090 --> 01:51:52,620
Ed Hartwick : there's no specimen segment, but a specimen segment isn't necessarily a required field, because it could be filled in other places, but it's probably it's better to have down here so there's a few things that you know you can you can skip by with a basic message on some stuff and.

744
01:51:52,620 --> 01:52:00,150
Ed Hartwick : You know, it really is there to kind of highlight the differences between what system is somewhat.

745
01:52:00,150 --> 01:52:11,190
Ed Hartwick : common areas and a lot of this stuff to the all comes comes from that what I mentioned before about big interpretations and names this this is kind of a good example here.

746
01:52:11,190 --> 01:52:21,330
Ed Hartwick : yo yo RC 23 segments, the ordering facility phone number and you think that's the phone number of the facility, placing the Order No that's actually.

747
01:52:21,330 --> 01:52:33,060
Ed Hartwick : The the phone number of the facility doing the order the order the the phone number of the fastest facility, placing the order is the callback number and ocr or C 14.

748
01:52:33,060 --> 01:52:50,580
Ed Hartwick : So it's sometimes it's like all right shame on hl seven for not being so clear in their terminology, although they did they would kind of they have gone back and updated the the explanations of some of these things to make it a bit more.

749
01:52:50,580 --> 01:53:03,180
Ed Hartwick : Straightforward to four things, of course, the regional facility identifiers, which was the US, and you know complete or incorrect coatings that kind of thing So those are usually what we have for common errors and stuff.

750
01:53:03,180 --> 01:53:13,350
Ed Hartwick : Lately, some of the common areas of also coming triggering sometimes it mixed messages will be triggered when they didn't need to be triggered so that kind of thing happens as well, so.

751
01:53:13,350 --> 01:53:15,150
Ed Hartwick : All right.

752
01:53:15,150 --> 01:53:16,920
Ed Hartwick : So.

753
01:53:16,920 --> 01:53:20,550
Ed Hartwick : I covered a lot of what the system has in does.

754
01:53:20,550 --> 01:53:24,390
Ed Hartwick : But a lot of things have changed.

755
01:53:24,390 --> 01:53:31,950
Ed Hartwick : Since cogan hit, and so I did want to spend a little time in here talking about kind of the impacts of how the pandemic has happened.

756
01:53:31,950 --> 01:53:51,780
Ed Hartwick : what's happened on tour systems themselves, one thing I didn't mention in the stone some of the stuff coming in, here too, is you know we have over the years gotten over the past year would have ended up using a lot more space like hard drive space than we had before.

757
01:53:51,780 --> 01:53:56,250
Ed Hartwick : There was one point during some of the the the.

758
01:53:56,250 --> 01:54:00,120
Ed Hartwick : kind of the real big.

759
01:54:00,120 --> 01:54:06,510
Ed Hartwick : Parts of the pandemic in, say, like August and September of last year.

760
01:54:06,510 --> 01:54:15,390
Ed Hartwick : Where we were we were estimating to use about eight or nine gigs a day of new data.

761
01:54:15,390 --> 01:54:23,130
Ed Hartwick : And that's it's just incredible amount of data that's being generated from all this information so.

762
01:54:23,130 --> 01:54:27,420
Ed Hartwick : So from kind of the thing to note right off the BAT.

763
01:54:27,420 --> 01:54:34,080
Ed Hartwick : These are, these are observations i've seen kind of just through this whole thing in the last year and a half.

764
01:54:34,080 --> 01:54:44,220
Ed Hartwick : You know the pandemics not over, even though a lot of folks have been using the term and past tense, we are still very much in the middle of it.

765
01:54:44,220 --> 01:54:55,860
Ed Hartwick : And so you know the big thing is this kind of goes with all things that are kind of currently going on, that you know when you get a chance to get away from.

766
01:54:55,860 --> 01:54:59,040
Ed Hartwick : it's the temporarily.

767
01:54:59,040 --> 01:55:06,870
Ed Hartwick : You know, things become a bit more clear hindsight, is always 2020 and when we get when the dust settles and we're actually able to get a chance to.

768
01:55:06,870 --> 01:55:19,470
Ed Hartwick : Go back and observe some of this data and analyze it better, we may find out on you know some of the things that I say here may or may not always be completely accurate so there's our little caveat so.

769
01:55:19,470 --> 01:55:32,790
Ed Hartwick : You know colada in general is is really you know it's hit hard across systems across the entire country there's just a massive amount of data that has been presented to us in the last year and a half.

770
01:55:32,790 --> 01:55:43,920
Ed Hartwick : it's the same, this is the second pandemic the MDS s has seen, but there are huge differences between us and what we saw in 2009 with each one and one.

771
01:55:43,920 --> 01:55:49,860
Ed Hartwick : First off is kind of the kind of how the response was is geared from public health itself.

772
01:55:49,860 --> 01:55:57,630
Ed Hartwick : We did not rely nearly as heavily as we did on on testing, as we do, though.

773
01:55:57,630 --> 01:56:10,050
Ed Hartwick : Back then, for for H1 and one yeah it's it's fuzzy because it's been 10 years as to why we didn't but you know a lot of those decisions are made at a you know, a level higher above mine too.

774
01:56:10,050 --> 01:56:18,420
Ed Hartwick : And some of that though could really be played into the fact that, like I mentioned before, we only had two hospitals that were sending us electronic labs in 2009.

775
01:56:18,420 --> 01:56:25,830
Ed Hartwick : Those two hospitals also we really had to kind of pull kicking and screaming into this we offered them.

776
01:56:25,830 --> 01:56:36,210
Ed Hartwick : The money to help now granted it wasn't really enough to cover all of their their stuff but um you know, they also had as a side benefit of you know, the.

777
01:56:36,210 --> 01:56:45,030
Ed Hartwick : infection control would be freed up to be able to do infection control and not just reporting to us and and the like, but either way we we ended up.

778
01:56:45,030 --> 01:56:50,700
Ed Hartwick : You know, having two systems in and going by 2009 but.

779
01:56:50,700 --> 01:57:06,300
Ed Hartwick : We ended up doing a lot of the works in order to make those those messages standardized and you know they did a lot of work on there, and as well the systems were not nearly as ready as they are now for this kind of thing back then.

780
01:57:06,300 --> 01:57:10,650
Ed Hartwick : Not only that, at the time to flu wasn't exactly.

781
01:57:10,650 --> 01:57:16,620
Ed Hartwick : You know it wasn't a reportable condition, and I think kind of scaling up that kind of operation.

782
01:57:16,620 --> 01:57:32,070
Ed Hartwick : Now granted H1 and when flu became reportable but scaling up the operation, even from an informatics standpoint in 2009 was a lot more difficult be but we had yeah at the time to hospitals for commercial submitters and one public health Center.

783
01:57:32,070 --> 01:57:49,230
Ed Hartwick : To the SS and because of the just the amount of you know cases we were seeing a lot of what we were being put into the system where we're aggregate reports so so we could still get a lot of cases, but a lot of times it wouldn't necessarily be individual reports.

784
01:57:49,230 --> 01:57:51,180
So.

785
01:57:51,180 --> 01:58:02,130
Ed Hartwick : Excuse me i'm In contrast, now, by the time 2020 rolled around we had every pretty much every hospital in the state sending er.

786
01:58:02,130 --> 01:58:12,660
Ed Hartwick : We had over 120 centers across the state and maybe a handful of small hospitals that were still struggling with getting stuff going um.

787
01:58:12,660 --> 01:58:26,370
Ed Hartwick : But you know they they were had you know, had some sites they were probably a little bit in transition to from you know software change over risk, but you know, for the most part we had really good coverage across the state for healers.

788
01:58:26,370 --> 01:58:42,300
Ed Hartwick : Those the tests for this kind of things were developed quickly, they were you know people were already used to putting stuff into these lymph systems lymph systems become have come a long way in those last 10 years to where you know they could query quickly be.

789
01:58:42,300 --> 01:58:43,170
Ed Hartwick : turned.

790
01:58:43,170 --> 01:58:59,190
Ed Hartwick : to trigger based upon what they need to send us so it was it was very it was very straightforward for hospitals onboard one more tests when they have already onboard themselves into the sending.

791
01:58:59,190 --> 01:59:18,060
Ed Hartwick : We also required that all test results positive negative otherwise we're all reported within four hours of resulting and that was kind of order by the State health department which is you know part of the public health act that we had mentioned before, in that reportable disease list.

792
01:59:18,060 --> 01:59:25,650
Ed Hartwick : You know, hospitals have the ability to get things going but also there was a lot of testing that started happening in smaller private labs.

793
01:59:25,650 --> 01:59:41,820
Ed Hartwick : Especially ones that never had we've never heard of they had never done any type of testing that would have never ever been reported to us now, this is kind of an important thing to mention, too, when we talk I talk heavily about ACTA high tech.

794
01:59:41,820 --> 01:59:54,630
Ed Hartwick : But the key part of that, though, was that the meaningful use was for hospitals, who would take medicaid and medicare dollars.

795
01:59:54,630 --> 02:00:09,540
Ed Hartwick : The key part being also as hospitals private labs were really left out of this we've had a couple of big private lab centers within the state that that they really didn't have a whole lot of motivation to ever onboard fully into the lr.

796
02:00:09,540 --> 02:00:20,610
Ed Hartwick : Because there was no incentive for medicaid or medicare and there you know higher ups really didn't see the value so.

797
02:00:20,610 --> 02:00:36,270
Ed Hartwick : You had a lot smaller labs that we're now going to be doing a lot of this testing that didn't have a way of sending it to us and who, when an onboarding system, you know from the best case scenario, when you have your your.

798
02:00:36,270 --> 02:00:52,080
Ed Hartwick : Your ears data systems all set and ready to go and just you know, be able to flip on a switch you're still looking at least a you know, probably about a month to be able to get everything set to make sure that those messages are going to come through and be working through correctly.

799
02:00:52,080 --> 02:00:58,530
Ed Hartwick : And you're looking at you know somebody who's probably within two or three weeks, going to be sending you 200 cases a day.

800
02:00:58,530 --> 02:01:12,270
Ed Hartwick : Now normally was those sites, I had known worried we'd say all right we'll just interest up manually the system we didn't want them to have to enter everything manually system, because it was just going to take too much time it was going to be too Labor intensive.

801
02:01:12,270 --> 02:01:20,760
Ed Hartwick : So the big thing with is well how are we going to handle these, we have a lot of items in here so kind of.

802
02:01:20,760 --> 02:01:28,380
Ed Hartwick : We had to kind of move backwards, you know we're looking at new submitters know existing connections need to get them on fast very.

803
02:01:28,380 --> 02:01:45,240
Ed Hartwick : varying level of technical expertise, because there's sometimes i'm talking to people who you know the the very small lab and they're like okay here data entry person know you're our you know our lab reporting expert and they don't know anything about any of this stuff.

804
02:01:45,240 --> 02:01:52,860
Ed Hartwick : We also have varying levels of technological available availability some places had limb systems, some faceless didn't.

805
02:01:52,860 --> 02:02:01,710
Ed Hartwick : Some places just you know they got a federal grant by an abbott it now kit and that's you know they can fit on a desk.

806
02:02:01,710 --> 02:02:18,210
Ed Hartwick : He also had some places that we're looking at to have like well okay well the were shut down for Kobe we're not getting a lot of patients, but we have a lot of these NP swabs that are in touch supply maybe we can help, and you know, help the public health cars.

807
02:02:18,210 --> 02:02:27,720
Ed Hartwick : And so we said how are we going to get this information in we can have a blast from the past, we said csv file.

808
02:02:27,720 --> 02:02:36,360
Ed Hartwick : So we basically work to deal with csv uploads we had an existing way of being able to receive messages securely.

809
02:02:36,360 --> 02:02:45,540
Ed Hartwick : csv excel we're very common, no matter your technology level it's pretty easy to pick up even if you don't really know very well.

810
02:02:45,540 --> 02:03:01,410
Ed Hartwick : Then only basically needed was a converter to move it into html seven and have a template for people to follow, so that was kind of seen as our our best way to go, so we made a template on the first template.

811
02:03:01,410 --> 02:03:20,310
Ed Hartwick : You know kind of came out of necessity, I figured that you know we could probably take an excel file and you know do a bit of mapping back and forth between two different sheets and as long as we you know kind of copy Downs correctly, we could turn a.

812
02:03:20,310 --> 02:03:26,730
Ed Hartwick : We can turn a comedy limited set of variables into.

813
02:03:26,730 --> 02:03:30,060
Ed Hartwick : You know, a a.

814
02:03:30,060 --> 02:03:40,800
Ed Hartwick : Almost hl seven message basically an angel seven message that would be a one line, instead of several lines like we saw back a few slides ago.

815
02:03:40,800 --> 02:03:54,510
Ed Hartwick : Where you know, this would be all one single continuous line and then you know commas, instead of pipes so basically where we kind of we ended up with is that that kind of quick.

816
02:03:54,510 --> 02:04:12,240
Ed Hartwick : excel based converter I plug in the data in one tab the kind of promo hl seven was in the next tab you say the file is a csv and the off of the the the pro hl seven tab do a series of finding replaces based on keywords.

817
02:04:12,240 --> 02:04:19,470
Ed Hartwick : Find and replace commas with pipes make sure your data in the first place, to have any commas, because that's really it's going to mess you up.

818
02:04:19,470 --> 02:04:36,180
Ed Hartwick : And then you have an hl seven file and it worked out, it was very manually intensive work for us, but when we were working on this early on it, it allowed us flexibility that we didn't have before.

819
02:04:36,180 --> 02:04:47,550
Kevin John Dombkowski: So, are they sending or in this case, they sent you guys a csv and then the conversion happen on your side, or you ask them to do that, so they just sent you a csv.

820
02:04:47,550 --> 02:04:59,700
Ed Hartwick : yep they send us a csv we dropped it into this excel file, we did the conversion, because a lot of times I wasn't I didn't feel like a really comfortable trying to explain the crazy way that I did it.

821
02:04:59,700 --> 02:05:05,220
Ed Hartwick : And then we ended up with a csv batch file or an HR seven batch file from it.

822
02:05:05,220 --> 02:05:17,040
Ed Hartwick : Okay yeah and then we dropped it into the system, and I mean we just we had it set up that we had access to the rhapsody system, and we had a few folders that we could use as replay folders and drop it in and boom off to go.

823
02:05:17,040 --> 02:05:22,140
Ed Hartwick : So it worked out really well, but it was going to be too intense I mean it was.

824
02:05:22,140 --> 02:05:32,040
Ed Hartwick : A pain in the butt to do it with three labs I was worried about doing 30, and so we contacted our our developers at all time and said hey.

825
02:05:32,040 --> 02:05:39,960
Ed Hartwick : You know, because they're, the ones who are working on the messaging stuff for us, we said we need a converter, so we had we ended up having them make.

826
02:05:39,960 --> 02:05:51,690
Ed Hartwick : Because we had a converter that worked on other flat files, we sent out and can we do this off a csv file and then turn it into an hl seven file we kind of gave him the specs that he had out of this.

827
02:05:51,690 --> 02:06:09,570
Ed Hartwick : This excel mapper and within a couple of weeks, they had basically made us a file drop converters we drop a csv and and in a specific format and it pop out a series of hl seven messages and worked a really great so we refine that a little bit over time.

828
02:06:09,570 --> 02:06:17,310
Ed Hartwick : And what I thought was going to be maybe 30 labs and being closer to 150.

829
02:06:17,310 --> 02:06:32,130
Ed Hartwick : And so we found that the time and to take on some of these things as more and more people would follow the templates that we had but kind of not really they'd be you know a few things here there, they forget to remove commas that kind of thing.

830
02:06:32,130 --> 02:06:43,740
Ed Hartwick : So there was a lot of QA on our end so we decided to create an uploader into the system that would replace kind of our manual or our our secure transfer area, but instead.

831
02:06:43,740 --> 02:06:54,810
Ed Hartwick : Just kind of shifted into part of the MDS s and that's what I had mentioned before, is our csv uploader and then, when you upload then can scan the file and say okay well.

832
02:06:54,810 --> 02:07:12,090
Ed Hartwick : It could reject the file, where the the the transfer system that we had before couldn't do any QA rejections, because it wouldn't be able to say okay well you're you got cameras all over the place in here we don't deal with that no it's just you know here's your file.

833
02:07:12,090 --> 02:07:24,120
Ed Hartwick : that's because that's what i'm supposed to do, the new one, will have the collection controls like that oh like oh hey you're missing a name for this person, you need to have that filled out if you're not reporting until you do that.

834
02:07:24,120 --> 02:07:43,680
Ed Hartwick : Or you know you're not using the right code set here for this, we need to it needs to be a qualified code, so that kind of thing and I didn't include a link to our our our uploader faq that kind of does have let's see if I can bring this up real quick.

835
02:07:43,680 --> 02:07:51,750
Ed Hartwick : See bring it over here, because it does kind of show some of the can you guys see that yeah.

836
02:07:51,750 --> 02:08:00,840
Ed Hartwick : we're making an faq is kind of like oh here's what's the problems that you might have with with us things as we had used it you'd see it.

837
02:08:00,840 --> 02:08:12,990
Ed Hartwick : what's a neighbor who's really kind of the files because it's a real real simple one it's like you're you're clear ID your name, address, date of birth, sex, race, ethnicity.

838
02:08:12,990 --> 02:08:28,800
Ed Hartwick : You know a few items that you might be helpful medical record numbers essentially numbers specimen source tests name and like this was one thing, and this is one thing that's often used at a local level or you know, on the other end some force for some folks.

839
02:08:28,800 --> 02:08:36,750
Ed Hartwick : Some folks know knowing some don't so we kind of left it open and saying hey if you don't know what to put here ask us, because we will know.

840
02:08:36,750 --> 02:08:40,800
Ed Hartwick : And usually, when we are signing people up to do this kind of stuff we say.

841
02:08:40,800 --> 02:08:54,030
Ed Hartwick : All right, what kind of tests are you running and we would get the lines, corresponding to those tests and tell them okay well you're using these three tests so here, these three links that you need to use or all you only use one test so just use this one more all the time.

842
02:08:54,030 --> 02:09:02,040
Ed Hartwick : And that will help out quite a bit and then, of course, information, you know provider information facility ordering date all that kind of stuff.

843
02:09:02,040 --> 02:09:16,440
Ed Hartwick : The idea is, you have a template where all of these items will be listed across the top and then records would be filled in below and it'd be able to convert it really well is worked out super super well for this kind of situation.

844
02:09:16,440 --> 02:09:21,630
Ed Hartwick : But you know coming back to this, though it is you know.

845
02:09:21,630 --> 02:09:26,370
Ed Hartwick : it's a stopgap it's it's not something we wanted.

846
02:09:26,370 --> 02:09:34,230
Ed Hartwick : As a permanent solution now some of these places, and it probably be a permanent solution, because when coben's done that will probably never hear from them ever again.

847
02:09:34,230 --> 02:09:38,820
Ed Hartwick : Well, other sites that like this was a push to be able to say okay well you know.

848
02:09:38,820 --> 02:09:46,740
Ed Hartwick : They use this as a springboard for their business they're moving in St and STD testing to they're moving into hepatitis testing.

849
02:09:46,740 --> 02:10:03,630
Ed Hartwick : And we push them say Okay, you know we can start with csv but you're going to want to move HR seven and there we've probably converted Oh, maybe about a dozen sites over the age of seven from the csv so it's been a success as a springboard.

850
02:10:03,630 --> 02:10:12,690
Ed Hartwick : For that kind of thing and we we also designed it to that it would could work with any condition if we had to so that that like is kind of the key and then, if we put a.

851
02:10:12,690 --> 02:10:17,790
Ed Hartwick : chlamydia log in there if we had to say all right, well, we got we got like you know.

852
02:10:17,790 --> 02:10:32,340
Ed Hartwick : The site had a whole bunch of eliminated tests, we need to have this in you know they don't have a good connection let's just get them all in we can do that kind of thing so it's really been a super helpful item for us.

853
02:10:32,340 --> 02:10:39,270
Ed Hartwick : And then, of course, with along with these problems that we've had is kind of the growing pains is like the call it.

854
02:10:39,270 --> 02:10:47,880
Ed Hartwick : You know, in January 2020 before the pandemic hit we we were receiving about 1800 labs a day you know I basically kind of took the all of.

855
02:10:47,880 --> 02:10:57,930
Ed Hartwick : All of January and divided by the number of days, and we ended up with 1800 and one labs per day coming into January we have about 1200 people Wednesday Wednesday.

856
02:10:57,930 --> 02:11:09,180
Ed Hartwick : The 15th of January is a Wednesday in the middle of the month, so I kind of took it as like kind of one of our more peak days at 1200 people login that day by May.

857
02:11:09,180 --> 02:11:20,070
Ed Hartwick : We I mean back in January, we had no idea how what our limits of the system would be in May we figured out the link that the system can handle about 14,000 messages a day.

858
02:11:20,070 --> 02:11:33,360
Ed Hartwick : As we passed 15,000 messages we were slowly falling behind the system itself had 2000 users in it are inside of you know, Wednesday may 13.

859
02:11:33,360 --> 02:11:44,520
Ed Hartwick : And I mean we had had to expand the use of the systems available memory and available processors in order to try and handle the lie this as well.

860
02:11:44,520 --> 02:11:51,540
Ed Hartwick : We in May we kind of realized that we needed to prioritize positive messages over negative messages.

861
02:11:51,540 --> 02:11:58,800
Ed Hartwick : And we did that in the rhapsody system, so therefore we would leave the met the positive message to come in.

862
02:11:58,800 --> 02:12:14,010
Ed Hartwick : into the system unimpeded and the negative messages would travel at a slower rate so it's not really overwhelm the system to keep us under that 14,000 we would effectively be running you know behind.

863
02:12:14,010 --> 02:12:25,860
Ed Hartwick : But the negative messages at 14,000 a day, where you know we're really more useful at that point to determine positivity than it was to determine, like any type of you know.

864
02:12:25,860 --> 02:12:31,170
Ed Hartwick : Individual person's negative status so.

865
02:12:31,170 --> 02:12:46,860
Ed Hartwick : by November when really that's kind of when we hit the peak of the the pandemic last year November 21, which is the the Saturday before thanksgiving when a lot of people were really trying to make thanksgiving.

866
02:12:46,860 --> 02:12:57,240
Ed Hartwick : We kind of reached what I have found to be our top number of 97,472 messages in one single day.

867
02:12:57,240 --> 02:13:12,600
Ed Hartwick : And that was like I mean that's looking back at the beginning of the year that's an incredible incredible increase on a daily basis, we had over 2700 users log into the system you just three days before in the middle of that week.

868
02:13:12,600 --> 02:13:30,000
Ed Hartwick : You know, and so it's this the amount of information that we received during this pandemic is is just incredible and even today we still regularly receive over 50,000 messages a day.

869
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:41,370
Ed Hartwick : But you know with that kind of bit too we'd also started using a solar database for some of this as well, like solar it's something I hadn't really heard of before.

870
02:13:41,370 --> 02:13:52,890
Ed Hartwick : You know, last couple of years and really what it is it's a web based system on the lucene indexing system that's kind of how our chief architect is really been.

871
02:13:52,890 --> 02:13:57,180
Ed Hartwick : has been kind of describing it.

872
02:13:57,180 --> 02:14:00,690
Ed Hartwick : So we.

873
02:14:00,690 --> 02:14:06,780
Ed Hartwick : We use that really is to kind of catalog our stuff in the system and the back end.

874
02:14:06,780 --> 02:14:11,910
Ed Hartwick : And then I use it to really kind of handle our lab reporting.

875
02:14:11,910 --> 02:14:18,330
Ed Hartwick : This made it possible for us to be able to give accurate lab numbers.

876
02:14:18,330 --> 02:14:33,750
Ed Hartwick : without having to have the system process every single thing coming through, and on top of that, to it allowed it if the system where say if we were behind md duplication inside the MDS so we could also be able to report.

877
02:14:33,750 --> 02:14:42,780
Ed Hartwick : You know this kind of numbers, without having to worry about people being able to keep up as well we didn't have to worry about duplicate still, but we did have a path.

878
02:14:42,780 --> 02:14:49,710
Ed Hartwick : and analysis pattern for that on some of these exports to be able to account for some of those so that worked on the well as well.

879
02:14:49,710 --> 02:15:01,050
Ed Hartwick : So we were able to give accurate lab data in a timely fashion without having to impede the system and overstressed it to be able to pull those kind of numbers so.

880
02:15:01,050 --> 02:15:10,440
Ed Hartwick : Solar has been kind of a real key on that one too that's what i'm going to kind of cover real quick here, because I know we're kind of running close on time here.

881
02:15:10,440 --> 02:15:22,800
Ed Hartwick : The system usage we haven't like I mentioned before, we were up dramatically, we saw transactions increase very much 10 20% every year, but by 2020 we we increased over 450%.

882
02:15:22,800 --> 02:15:32,040
Ed Hartwick : The key in Canada big thing is, even though the MDS wasn't able to process all the lies that we got in we got 27 years worth of the alarm is based upon.

883
02:15:32,040 --> 02:15:39,810
Ed Hartwick : 2009 which 2009, if you remember from the previous graph was a record breaking year by almost 100%.

884
02:15:39,810 --> 02:15:48,840
Ed Hartwick : And we got 27 years worth of that data, instead of one year, and only were able to process, you know 11 years with the data now we've done a lot of changes in the system.

885
02:15:48,840 --> 02:15:57,930
Ed Hartwick : Since then, so where message processing moved from a 14 to closer to 30,000 messages a day, but still even this year we've only been able to process.

886
02:15:57,930 --> 02:16:17,880
Ed Hartwick : You know about 7.3 million messages that's still nothing that shaker first there um but still it's a it's a lot of information we ended have problems with system stability and slowness, but the ones that took the longest to handle were actually limitations due to.

887
02:16:17,880 --> 02:16:26,280
Ed Hartwick : You know hardware itself like we have a lot of crashes in August, which turns out to be like a server setting that was limiting our Ram usage.

888
02:16:26,280 --> 02:16:38,070
Ed Hartwick : Once we got that fixed I mean it's like things have changed and and also our database and that was on our productions no Yes, that was on our production system or application system.

889
02:16:38,070 --> 02:16:47,070
Ed Hartwick : And our database side, the system had literally just run out of resources and there was nothing that we could do about it until we get to have a replacement system.

890
02:16:47,070 --> 02:16:51,690
Ed Hartwick : And once that came in and really solve their problems and we've kind of opened us up there.

891
02:16:51,690 --> 02:16:57,870
Ed Hartwick : So there's there's been a lot of hardware struggles even that anything to and then here's kind of some quick, this is.

892
02:16:57,870 --> 02:17:06,060
Ed Hartwick : The the system statistics I showed you before what I didn't show you is actually we had kind of throw in some of the numbers for 21 or 2020.

893
02:17:06,060 --> 02:17:17,790
Ed Hartwick : And really kind of keeping those things out there, show you know allows you to actually see some detail before you're hit with this incredible amount of increase in the system.

894
02:17:17,790 --> 02:17:28,350
Ed Hartwick : And the same goes for electronic messaging here we are, I mean I haven't even had a chance to really go and break it down by you know these three categories in since.

895
02:17:28,350 --> 02:17:44,520
Ed Hartwick : you're looking at 2019 years the hepatitis ones and boom 2020 that puts everything to shame, you know it's just an incredible amount of data that we have received I don't ever think will we i'd never went into that we would have gotten this kind of data.

896
02:17:44,520 --> 02:17:54,690
Ed Hartwick : And then you'll see the increase the increase in electronic messaging between 2019 and 2020 increases over 2,600%.

897
02:17:54,690 --> 02:18:01,140
Ed Hartwick : So it's just in creating incredible credible one of information.

898
02:18:01,140 --> 02:18:10,380
Ed Hartwick : I could cover a little bit real quick on modernizing the system, but basically when i'm going to kind of wrap up here with is that.

899
02:18:10,380 --> 02:18:22,020
Ed Hartwick : The one of the things we realized over this year and the amount of funding that we were able to secure is that we need to rebuild the entire system, so we put out surveys to really look at.

900
02:18:22,020 --> 02:18:29,700
Ed Hartwick : You know what works in the system, what doesn't work in the system hired consultants in to kind of give us that gap analysis overview of it.

901
02:18:29,700 --> 02:18:41,370
Ed Hartwick : And then we're we're currently working on rebuilding that entire system they were working at a breakneck speed and when when you give a kind of a timeline of what we're going to look at.

902
02:18:41,370 --> 02:18:51,240
Ed Hartwick : we're looking at between 18 months two years and you're thinking wow that's a lot of time, but when you're looking at redeveloping the system from scratch really it's not.

903
02:18:51,240 --> 02:19:09,870
Ed Hartwick : So we're trying to borrow a lot on what we do know works in the system and really kind of move forward and and use like you know modern interfaces a lot more customization of of screens and whatnot for folks and and really kind of try and.

904
02:19:09,870 --> 02:19:22,170
Ed Hartwick : move forward farther into the into the 2020s with an eye for the fact that we may not be able to do this for another 20 years I mean the system itself is 17 years old right now.

905
02:19:22,170 --> 02:19:30,390
Ed Hartwick : And we kind of looked at ourselves as more of a photoshop than a windows were like you know photoshop one's been around for 30 years.

906
02:19:30,390 --> 02:19:38,670
Ed Hartwick : or photoshop spin around for 30 years but it's not nearly the the program and it was 30 years ago and reinvented itself over and over and over.

907
02:19:38,670 --> 02:19:48,840
Ed Hartwick : that's kind of what we've kind of been working towards, but I think this is going to be a big leap forward for us and that kind of pushed so there's two so.

908
02:19:48,840 --> 02:19:55,620
Ed Hartwick : With that, though I think i'll kind of wrap it up and i'm willing to any type of questions on a lot of this stuff too.

909
02:19:55,620 --> 02:20:01,170
Kevin John Dombkowski: Well, in fact, we have one question off the BAT.

910
02:20:01,170 --> 02:20:07,410
Kevin John Dombkowski: So, what was the reason behind.

911
02:20:07,410 --> 02:20:10,260
Kevin John Dombkowski: not sending messages.

912
02:20:10,260 --> 02:20:14,850
Kevin John Dombkowski: You have to provide us with ESP.

913
02:20:14,850 --> 02:20:25,920
Kevin John Dombkowski: So the question I don't know if you heard that as well why we're labs not sending hl seven to start with, and then you have to sort of accommodate them with the CSP approach.

914
02:20:25,920 --> 02:20:34,740
Ed Hartwick : yeah it was one of it was one of those moments I really didn't want to do that kind of thing, but we didn't really have any choice, a lot of those labs.

915
02:20:34,740 --> 02:20:52,740
Ed Hartwick : They had never had a need to report to public health, I mean I remember one of the sites was they almost exclusively did cancer testing for stuff that I mean and cancer doesn't report that way through that type of AOL seven.

916
02:20:52,740 --> 02:20:58,890
Ed Hartwick : And so they they never they had never occurred to them that they might need to kind of interface like this.

917
02:20:58,890 --> 02:21:03,570
Ed Hartwick : A couple of them were a small kind of startups that were looking to expand.

918
02:21:03,570 --> 02:21:09,930
Ed Hartwick : And they had done like mostly like cholesterol tests or something like that, before.

919
02:21:09,930 --> 02:21:23,520
Ed Hartwick : Or you know just small scale STD testing for stuff and maybe they had been been doing, you know manual reporting before, but their volume was about to increase, you know 200 fold.

920
02:21:23,520 --> 02:21:41,970
Ed Hartwick : So a lot of that was just it was either they didn't have the systems or if they did have the systems they didn't have the time to be able to onboard it that quickly so that was really the key things in that.

921
02:21:41,970 --> 02:21:47,130
Kevin John Dombkowski: Question yeah was it difficult to reach out to the other software.

922
02:21:47,130 --> 02:22:05,250
Kevin John Dombkowski: companies like, for instance, provide that software that ability to convert those funds, so the question was was it difficult to reach out to vendors that provided the conversion software or assistance in that conversion or did you do that yourself I wasn't clear.

923
02:22:05,250 --> 02:22:13,020
Ed Hartwick : Well, the first converter, which was the the excel based one I did on a Sunday afternoon.

924
02:22:13,020 --> 02:22:24,660
Ed Hartwick : completely out of necessity, just because I knew I wasn't gonna I mean we were already asking a lot of our developers and we knew that I knew is going to be tough, to get them to do what I needed on that as quickly as I needed it.

925
02:22:24,660 --> 02:22:39,150
Ed Hartwick : And so that one was kind of a luck that I was able to do that was one of those inspiration moments, but i'm in order to find that the really know when it comes down to it, we have a maintenance contract with all.

926
02:22:39,150 --> 02:22:54,510
Ed Hartwick : The alternative Institute, which is in in Ann arbor to do messaging and our work and our rhapsody system, and they also had the maintenance contract for the MDS itself, so we had that existing vehicle.

927
02:22:54,510 --> 02:23:09,270
Ed Hartwick : To be able to pay them to do that work and they had the experience that we needed to do it, so we were lucky enough to have that contract in place to be able to do that conversion and the fact that we kind of done stuff like that, before.

928
02:23:09,270 --> 02:23:21,660
Ed Hartwick : The software itself the rhapsody software is is it's an integration engine, and it is a.

929
02:23:21,660 --> 02:23:24,480
Ed Hartwick : it's an integration engine but.

930
02:23:24,480 --> 02:23:38,280
Ed Hartwick : It does a lot of conversion stuff and I think I personally feel that integration engines are probably the coolest piece of software out there because they're just so diverse and what they can do you can give it one file format and it can turn it into whatever you want it to.

931
02:23:38,280 --> 02:23:44,220
Ed Hartwick : And so we knew we'd have the ability to take a csv and turn it into an HR seven file because.

932
02:23:44,220 --> 02:23:55,440
Ed Hartwick : Either we've done it or other people have done it and we'd be able to go and reach out to the Community and say hey you know we've got communities of other people in public health, who say we can say hey Is anybody else done.

933
02:23:55,440 --> 02:23:59,700
Ed Hartwick : A converter like this and, in fact, some of the after we had finished ours.

934
02:23:59,700 --> 02:24:11,250
Ed Hartwick : We were, I was kind of having conversations with New Jersey and I said hey i've got this converter it's not perfect, it might not work, exactly for you, but i'm willing to give you all the code that we have for it.

935
02:24:11,250 --> 02:24:19,980
Ed Hartwick : And they were able to you know, we were able to pack that piece up and send it over to them, and so, then their developers could then she wanted to.

936
02:24:19,980 --> 02:24:25,110
Kevin John Dombkowski: Any other questions oh yeah.

937
02:24:25,110 --> 02:24:27,270
Kevin John Dombkowski: yeah.

938
02:24:27,270 --> 02:24:41,670
Kevin John Dombkowski: I was wondering about the Community that you talked about what he wants you to use their feedback to gather information on how to change the this disease surveillance system and.

939
02:24:41,670 --> 02:24:46,200
Kevin John Dombkowski: Looking at other states is the best part for.

940
02:24:46,200 --> 02:24:48,090
Kevin John Dombkowski: me.

941
02:24:48,090 --> 02:24:54,090
Kevin John Dombkowski: So did you use feedback from the broader community to identify.

942
02:24:54,090 --> 02:24:59,880
Kevin John Dombkowski: features and functions to improve the system so including other states that sort of thing.

943
02:24:59,880 --> 02:25:13,110
Ed Hartwick : Well, I mean we kind of we had kind of left that out to the groups that we contracted with so when we were looking to go and create you know to revamp the CSS.

944
02:25:13,110 --> 02:25:20,760
Ed Hartwick : One of the things we knew, is that we didn't have time in the middle of the pandemic do our own research on this, and so we put out for bid.

945
02:25:20,760 --> 02:25:27,390
Ed Hartwick : Basically, a request for a service to have somebody have a consultant group come in and do this contract for us.

946
02:25:27,390 --> 02:25:36,150
Ed Hartwick : And we actually kind of reached out to a couple of folks to see if they were you know, a couple of parties that we had worked with before and say hey you know this is out here, if you want to bid for it.

947
02:25:36,150 --> 02:25:50,640
Ed Hartwick : And we actually ran into a group called very done there from maine and I don't think we'd ever heard of them before and they they did a great job they were able to go through and look at this and they had a lot of experts on their own team.

948
02:25:50,640 --> 02:26:05,610
Ed Hartwick : who had worked in state health departments or worked in public health in general, before so they had an idea of some of the things that were out there as well, and they did have contacts with folks as well, so we we left it really to them to kind of handle that research.

949
02:26:05,610 --> 02:26:14,310
Ed Hartwick : But we did put them in contact with our local public health groups and said, you know and say okay here's here's the folks that you need to interview.

950
02:26:14,310 --> 02:26:27,510
Ed Hartwick : Who are daily system is like folks at Level local public health folks in the healthcare community in general, like that have access to the system and folks in the programs here at the state as well.

951
02:26:27,510 --> 02:26:40,350
Kevin John Dombkowski: So we're just about out of time, but I do have sort of an overarching question that I think a lot of students would be interested in, can you talk a little bit about the training and skills that your typical staff have and.

952
02:26:40,350 --> 02:26:46,290
Kevin John Dombkowski: In your House bit about what sort of folks you look for when you're looking to hire folks.

953
02:26:46,290 --> 02:26:48,930
Kevin John Dombkowski: yeah what type of effort.

954
02:26:48,930 --> 02:26:58,860
Ed Hartwick : yeah the big thing in having a it's it's kind of tough because informatics in a way it's a very competitive environment, right now, too.

955
02:26:58,860 --> 02:27:05,070
Ed Hartwick : And so we want to make sure that we have people are like leave it open enough for people who are.

956
02:27:05,070 --> 02:27:11,760
Ed Hartwick : With like a baby a background and happy and not not much of a informatics background or people have a real big background in informatics.

957
02:27:11,760 --> 02:27:28,830
Ed Hartwick : or other, you know information science queries that don't necessarily have a huge EPI background the big thing for us as with a lot of this has been kind of focused towards some skills out there, knowing hl seven.

958
02:27:28,830 --> 02:27:39,300
Ed Hartwick : gives a big advantage and that kind of thing, whether it's just HR seven to five or CDA knowing that kind of business, really, really helps.

959
02:27:39,300 --> 02:27:51,540
Ed Hartwick : From it helps us, for you know as an organization because it's less training that we have to do, but also, you know, at the very least, even knowing about what they are and what they do is a huge step up.

960
02:27:51,540 --> 02:28:01,530
Ed Hartwick : Having an idea of how these information systems can work and talk to each other, is another thing that we really kind of look for.

961
02:28:01,530 --> 02:28:06,600
Ed Hartwick : lab experience and we've had we've had a lot of folks who have applied.

962
02:28:06,600 --> 02:28:10,140
Ed Hartwick : who had been retired have a bad lab experience.

963
02:28:10,140 --> 02:28:23,910
Ed Hartwick : Through things but yeah even even and and also you know, having an actual degree in informatics also obviously gives a leg leg up on a lot of this we had.

964
02:28:23,910 --> 02:28:27,210
Ed Hartwick : let's see we had in.

965
02:28:27,210 --> 02:28:33,780
Ed Hartwick : I think when we started in a lot of this, I think we didn't really have.

966
02:28:33,780 --> 02:28:35,520
Ed Hartwick : A.

967
02:28:35,520 --> 02:28:40,200
Ed Hartwick : lot of folks with actual informatics degrees that were.

968
02:28:40,200 --> 02:28:42,360
Ed Hartwick : That were.

969
02:28:42,360 --> 02:28:51,960
Ed Hartwick : On the system or it would have applied so I mean even myself, I mean Mike degreed predates informatics.

970
02:28:51,960 --> 02:28:56,940
Ed Hartwick : The existence of it really i'm by nature, a geographer.

971
02:28:56,940 --> 02:29:13,770
Ed Hartwick : And my masters in Jews in geographic information science and so we have have hired other GIs we folks as well for this kind of thing as well, you mean it's not the important part is that you understand information.

972
02:29:13,770 --> 02:29:18,930
Ed Hartwick : How it moves how it can move and how people need to use it.

973
02:29:18,930 --> 02:29:22,590
Ed Hartwick : that's kind of been I think an important thing for us.

974
02:29:22,590 --> 02:29:32,850
Ed Hartwick : Technical service stuff that helps but you know it's really going to help you as an individual more than would help us as an organization, I think.

975
02:29:32,850 --> 02:29:43,890
Ed Hartwick : Of course, helping you as an individual will help us as an organization, so you know kind of a win, win there but it's certainly not a pre requirement, but if we're looking for like you know the leg up.

976
02:29:43,890 --> 02:29:53,490
Ed Hartwick : at seven that's going to be the way if you get if you understand messaging and you understand a lot.

977
02:29:53,490 --> 02:29:56,790
Kevin John Dombkowski: of questions.
