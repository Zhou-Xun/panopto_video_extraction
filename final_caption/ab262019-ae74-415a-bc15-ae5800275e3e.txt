Hello. Welcome back to changing climate changing reservations,

2
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:13,940
a podcast about climate change and its effect on Native Americans and Alaska Native communities.

3
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:19,010
I'm your host, Andrew Leamon. Thanks again for joining us here in episode two.

4
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:26,390
In today's episode, we're going to bounce around the United States, going from an Alaskan fishing village where they're facing raising water levels in

5
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:33,170
permafrost to a Native American village on the Olympic Peninsula in Washington,

6
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:35,990
facing storm surges in washed out roads.

7
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:43,790
Additionally, we'll visit Navajo Nation, where a drought is causing citizens of the reservation to have to drive for miles and miles to get water.

8
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:45,440
A staple of daily life.

9
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:56,080
And additionally, we'll visit the Ozarks, where the Cherokee Nation is facing issues with their heritage crops being unable to be grown.

10
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:00,370
Into Alaska, which is a big fishing village.

11
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:03,130
The water levels are getting higher and higher.

12
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:10,090
This village is located on thick, frozen ground called permafrost in the building sit very, very close to the water.

13
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:12,700
These days, as the high tides get higher and higher.

14
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:19,270
It actually causes the grounds to shift some of the buildings to get washed out and makes their buildings unusable,

15
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:25,080
causing people to either have to leave the village or relocate their buildings higher up on the land.

16
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:31,950
A similar issues facing forward a nation which is on the Olympic Peninsula just outside of Seattle, as temperatures rise,

17
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,780
storms are getting more and more intense,

18
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:39,840
storm surges are getting higher and buildings that were well above the waterline are now getting hit with large waves.

19
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:47,430
And additionally, roads that are getting their population to and from the village are now getting covered with water again,

20
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:54,060
forcing this population out of their native area, going to higher ground in Navajo Nation.

21
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,830
There's a very, very severe drought,

22
00:01:55,830 --> 00:02:02,550
causing citizens to have to drive from all over the reservation to go to areas that are hooked up to a municipal water supply.

23
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:09,930
Shockingly, on the reservation, a very large number of people don't have access to running water, and so these people used to rely on wells.

24
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:16,800
But due to a drought, the wells have all dried up. So now people are driving miles and miles to cities like Gallup, New Mexico,

25
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:23,080
where they have to fill a 55 gallon drums to get their water for the week.

26
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:30,010
All of these populations are showing various forms of resiliency, either moving their buildings up higher, driving for water.

27
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:31,570
And interestingly as well,

28
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:39,130
this deep connection with the land that Native Americans have other populations are showing resiliency by reviving old native techniques.

29
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:46,510
For example, this one Amish tribe in Washington is building the first modern clam garden in the United States,

30
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:54,250
where they're now able to grow that native staple food. The carrot tribe in Northern California is also revisiting old techniques,

31
00:02:54,250 --> 00:03:00,960
and they're now recommending prescribed burns on their land to help ease California's wildlife problems.

32
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,680
Native American populations do face much environmental injustice,

33
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,450
but due to their connection with the land and their understanding of its intertwining with human health,

34
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:14,965
they are able to come up with resiliency strategies to benefit them and the land around them.
