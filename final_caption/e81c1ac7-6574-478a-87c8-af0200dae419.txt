1
00:00:01,768 --> 00:00:25,578
Right. Good morning. It does promptly get started and then we will finish with the reviewing the last method for conditioning.

2
00:00:26,268 --> 00:00:31,998
Again, controlling for confounding is actually two methods.

3
00:00:32,148 --> 00:00:42,648
Um, and I thought it can be perhaps a little dense, so I, so they would do they give you also the super.

4
00:00:45,178 --> 00:00:49,008
Summary of what we are going to be talking about. Um.

5
00:00:50,928 --> 00:00:58,428
We have done this to. Right? And the ones that we will cover today are this.

6
00:01:00,088 --> 00:01:13,818
So. The first three methods standardization IP W and stratification with pooling, which is the first thing we will discuss today.

7
00:01:15,278 --> 00:01:31,898
Basically consist of. Waiting statement, specific estimates to put them together into a single summary estimate that takes into account confounding.

8
00:01:32,318 --> 00:01:37,258
Right. So they all involved.

9
00:01:38,458 --> 00:01:43,018
Obtaining weighted averages of the estimates of association.

10
00:01:47,198 --> 00:01:50,818
This last one. Matching.

11
00:01:51,858 --> 00:02:04,618
Is different. It is something that's usually implemented at the level of designing, signing study rather than at the level of analyzing a study.

12
00:02:06,048 --> 00:02:14,118
That's different from the first three, right, which are implemented at the level of analysis when you already have the data.

13
00:02:21,368 --> 00:02:32,088
So as you will see. I guess the main difference between stratification with polling and the other

14
00:02:32,808 --> 00:02:39,138
weighting based methods we have been through is the type of weights that are used.

15
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:45,808
That's the key difference, right? Um.

16
00:02:47,568 --> 00:02:52,368
My team, as I mentioned before, is is something different in that?

17
00:02:57,278 --> 00:03:04,718
What you have to do if you want to match is when you are designing this study, you have to.

18
00:03:06,028 --> 00:03:13,998
Select people. That it's in the context of a case control study.

19
00:03:14,868 --> 00:03:24,468
You select a case, you will select a control that has the same values on the characteristics that you want to match for.

20
00:03:26,178 --> 00:03:40,128
And those characteristics should be confounders. By doing that though, you will introduce selection bias by design.

21
00:03:41,698 --> 00:03:51,568
And therefore you must always analyze a matched case control study taking into account the fact that you have.

22
00:03:55,108 --> 00:04:01,448
Artificially. Selected controls that have the same values.

23
00:04:03,738 --> 00:04:08,908
On the confounding as the cases. Yeah, that.

24
00:04:08,928 --> 00:04:12,888
That's a. You want to.

25
00:04:13,988 --> 00:04:17,618
Wrap up and leave. That's okay. All right.

26
00:04:18,248 --> 00:04:23,048
Is that clear? The sort of the essence of what we are going to be doing today?

27
00:04:24,508 --> 00:04:30,478
Okay. Plus, you knew this because, of course, that's in the readings that you read very religiously.

28
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:36,028
Right. So let's get started with stratification and bullying.

29
00:04:38,198 --> 00:04:47,278
And for that, let's revisit the example of. The mortality rates between Sweden and Panama, you remember.

30
00:04:49,718 --> 00:04:55,138
It was a paradox there that they seemed. Higher in Sweden than they were in Panama.

31
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:59,758
The reason was that they were confounded by age.

32
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:11,218
The age distribution between the two countries differed. So we standardized those rates.

33
00:05:13,108 --> 00:05:23,238
Using. A number of. Weights as the standard and you manage to correct the problem.

34
00:05:23,808 --> 00:05:28,148
This was the crude. Incidence rate ratio.

35
00:05:29,618 --> 00:05:34,458
Mortality ratio. That showed higher mortality in Sweden.

36
00:05:34,788 --> 00:05:37,908
And these would be the standardized.

37
00:05:38,978 --> 00:05:43,578
Mortality ratios. According to different standards.

38
00:05:45,008 --> 00:05:51,338
And what's the difference between the standards? The difference between the standards is basically the weights, right?

39
00:05:51,758 --> 00:05:56,138
Each standard has a different set of weights for each age group.

40
00:05:56,418 --> 00:06:05,298
Right. Okay. So, you know, there is obviously nothing fundamentally wrong with that method.

41
00:06:06,348 --> 00:06:19,628
But in some instances. The choice of a relatively arbitrary standard or weighting scheme, as you always do in standardization.

42
00:06:21,638 --> 00:06:29,048
Might be problematic if you end up assigning large weights to strata that have.

43
00:06:29,968 --> 00:06:41,298
Small numbers. Or vice versa. And the problems that you might run into are basically, you know, statistical you lose statistical efficiency.

44
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:50,458
We haven't talked much about statistical efficiency, but I guess for now, we're just as good to.

45
00:06:52,218 --> 00:06:57,408
Just be patient for a couple of lectures when we discuss.

46
00:06:58,568 --> 00:07:09,188
So there might be nothing wrong with the actual point estimate of association, but it may be more uncertain.

47
00:07:11,398 --> 00:07:17,638
You may be less certain that this estimate actually covers the underlying parameter.

48
00:07:18,908 --> 00:07:21,988
Okay. So because of that.

49
00:07:23,508 --> 00:07:30,888
Um. There is an option and alternative of using other means.

50
00:07:32,048 --> 00:07:39,158
Weights that can be derived from your own data and therefore will always overcome.

51
00:07:40,378 --> 00:07:44,818
That issue of having some cells with small numbers.

52
00:07:46,328 --> 00:07:57,758
So those weights are sometimes called built in weights because the always be built using your own data the same need, right?

53
00:07:58,918 --> 00:08:03,448
So. That's all there is about certification and bullet.

54
00:08:05,078 --> 00:08:12,028
Is the name for. For me. The weights are called Mountain Hansen.

55
00:08:12,878 --> 00:08:22,248
Because. These were the two people who invented them, you know, back in the 1940 and 1950s, a long time ago.

56
00:08:24,848 --> 00:08:32,208
But they're still, you know, helpful and important to note. So we will present.

57
00:08:33,268 --> 00:08:38,038
The use of mental hansell weights to correct for confounding.

58
00:08:39,298 --> 00:08:45,508
Two estimates, the types of estimates, incidence rate ratios and odds ratios.

59
00:08:46,798 --> 00:08:57,178
We will begin with incidence readmissions. And for that I will actually work through the same Sweden and Panama Excel.

60
00:08:59,378 --> 00:09:04,988
It's helpful to sort of have in mind a little bit of.

61
00:09:06,508 --> 00:09:14,188
Notation table here I guess to give names to the cells of five regular two by two table.

62
00:09:16,688 --> 00:09:25,208
So in this particular notation table, we have two columns, one for the exposed, one for the unexposed,

63
00:09:25,808 --> 00:09:33,488
and we have for each column we have two rows, one for the number of events and the other for the total person time.

64
00:09:35,018 --> 00:09:39,218
And then we have the sum of person time exposed and unexposed.

65
00:09:39,248 --> 00:09:49,228
This is the some of these two sets get. So the weights that you will apply to each stratum.

66
00:09:50,418 --> 00:10:05,498
I basically. Built based on this formula, the product of unexposed cases times there is some time exposed.

67
00:10:05,628 --> 00:10:10,058
So these diagonal divided by the total person time.

68
00:10:11,738 --> 00:10:15,858
I mean, if you may ask. Quite violently so.

69
00:10:16,788 --> 00:10:21,018
Why? I mean, why not something else? I mean, the answer is.

70
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:28,438
But both mathematical and historical. But basically, those are the ways that present the best.

71
00:10:29,808 --> 00:10:33,708
Efficiency and statistical precision. Okay.

72
00:10:33,728 --> 00:10:43,338
And again, you know, if you're really interested, I'll be happy to dig out the nitty gritty details of how these were built.

73
00:10:45,238 --> 00:10:54,358
All right. There used to be a course on the history of epidemiologic methods here, but it seems all the good stuff is going away.

74
00:10:57,728 --> 00:11:00,848
Including this course. All right.

75
00:11:01,868 --> 00:11:09,518
So how do we actually implement this? Well, the first thing that I have going here is they have stratified.

76
00:11:10,718 --> 00:11:14,708
That example on Sweden and Panama by age group.

77
00:11:15,698 --> 00:11:23,078
So the procedure is a little different from what we did for standardization because the

78
00:11:23,228 --> 00:11:29,257
standardization you may recall we first estimated incidence rates for exposed and unexposed,

79
00:11:29,258 --> 00:11:33,208
and then within each group we applied the weights to the incidence rates.

80
00:11:33,218 --> 00:11:41,738
We obtained standardized incidence rate. And at the very end, we estimated the ratio of standardized rates between exposed and exposed.

81
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:47,048
So here is different in that I, I have first stratified by age.

82
00:11:47,558 --> 00:11:53,438
So within each age group I have brought the data for the exposed and the unexposed.

83
00:11:54,418 --> 00:11:58,918
And here I have estimated the incidence rate ratios for each strata.

84
00:12:00,588 --> 00:12:07,268
Right. So that's the first proceed. The next step is we are going to.

85
00:12:11,308 --> 00:12:17,908
Apply this formula to each step because actually this sub index, I means that to start.

86
00:12:18,298 --> 00:12:33,708
Right. So it has to be applied to each step. Well, note, I guess that that as you can confirm here they are confounding by age because.

87
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:42,998
There is also an effect modification by age, but their rates are very different for each strategizing is great.

88
00:12:43,268 --> 00:12:49,898
So the association between country and mortality differs for each age struck.

89
00:12:51,648 --> 00:12:57,018
Now let's apply those. 19 Hanson So we first have to just calculate.

90
00:12:58,248 --> 00:13:01,898
The weights, which had arbitrary numbers. Really? So.

91
00:13:03,698 --> 00:13:08,737
If we multiply in each stratum the number of unexposed cases,

92
00:13:08,738 --> 00:13:16,628
times the exposed person time and divide that by the total person time, we will get these numbers right.

93
00:13:19,108 --> 00:13:32,928
These are not the weights yet. Is that just the component of the weights to actually get to the weights, we have to add up these numbers and then.

94
00:13:34,848 --> 00:13:45,568
Divide each number by the total. To get a proportion of what that number is out of the total sort of absolute value for the weights.

95
00:13:46,858 --> 00:13:58,558
So for this stratum, they will be the number we obtain from that calculation divided by the sum of the stratum specific calculations.

96
00:13:59,188 --> 00:14:05,668
That's point 46 or the next stratum would be this number divided by that total point 19.

97
00:14:06,068 --> 00:14:11,098
Before the last one would be these number divided by the total or point 35.

98
00:14:12,508 --> 00:14:18,968
Those are the weights. And the next step is simply to.

99
00:14:20,238 --> 00:14:27,228
Multiply the stratum a specific instance weight ratio times the corresponding weight.

100
00:14:28,528 --> 00:14:33,038
Right. And then add them up.

101
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:41,168
And after you do that, this case, you get a mental hansell incidence ratio of point 61.

102
00:14:42,418 --> 00:14:48,628
So it still did the job. You still get an adjusted, you see regression.

103
00:14:49,578 --> 00:14:54,048
That you have use different weights and you have done the procedure in a slightly different way.

104
00:14:57,758 --> 00:15:01,908
Right. So.

105
00:15:05,528 --> 00:15:15,638
This is this is just for information. I don't mean to scare you with this formula, but, you know, this is the summary way to.

106
00:15:17,558 --> 00:15:21,087
Calculate. The incidence ratio again.

107
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:24,508
I would never quiz you on this formula, not even its application.

108
00:15:24,688 --> 00:15:31,438
That's absurd because now you can do that with a couple of comments pretty much in any statistical software.

109
00:15:33,298 --> 00:15:36,098
So I just I just brought it here, sort of what you reference.

110
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:50,738
What is important, though, is that to apply this method to estimate mental hansell weighted incidence rate ratios, you have to assume homogeneity.

111
00:15:52,058 --> 00:16:02,348
Of the incidence rate ratio across strata homogeneity means you have to assume the incidence rate ratios do not really differ.

112
00:16:03,568 --> 00:16:08,578
Across the strata. And if they differ, is only by chance.

113
00:16:10,308 --> 00:16:17,388
Let me go back and ask you a question. You think that that assumption is fulfilled in this particular example?

114
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:30,818
It's not. He's not really. Perhaps it's not the best example for Mantill Hansen, but I wanted to keep some sort of continuity in the material.

115
00:16:31,298 --> 00:16:36,398
So the important thing is that you get what you know, what the assumption needs to be.

116
00:16:37,908 --> 00:16:46,098
Um, in other words, I guess you can also think, well, that means there could be confounding, but there should not be effectively fiction.

117
00:16:46,098 --> 00:16:55,858
Right? Because basically they. Difference in set specific incidence rate ratios means there is a significant.

118
00:16:57,368 --> 00:17:04,598
Okay. And the other important thing you should know is that.

119
00:17:05,918 --> 00:17:11,978
Because the weights, the mantel hansell which are derived from your own data in each study.

120
00:17:13,678 --> 00:17:19,318
The absolute values of your estimate of association may not be comparable across studies.

121
00:17:21,798 --> 00:17:29,148
Let's say you wanted to estimate the incidence ratio for death comparing Sweden and.

122
00:17:30,568 --> 00:17:34,588
Panama. And you get your mental hassle ratio.

123
00:17:34,828 --> 00:17:38,128
You will not be able to compare that number directly with the study.

124
00:17:38,128 --> 00:17:43,538
Comparing mortality in Sweden with mortality in what is your favorite country?

125
00:17:43,558 --> 00:17:46,638
Christopher. Switzerland?

126
00:17:46,788 --> 00:17:53,708
Yes. I wonder what the be the differences between mortality in Sweden and terror.

127
00:17:53,768 --> 00:17:59,168
That's an interesting question. If you know, if you were to be born at random.

128
00:18:01,268 --> 00:18:07,538
Well, we are sort of born and bred at random oblivion. If you could choose the country, you would.

129
00:18:09,438 --> 00:18:12,768
Which one would you choose? Switzerland or Sweden? Hmm.

130
00:18:15,268 --> 00:18:18,428
Which. All right? Uh huh.

131
00:18:20,348 --> 00:18:27,778
Any questions on this? Well.

132
00:18:30,198 --> 00:18:35,988
All right. Well, a couple of pointers here.

133
00:18:36,828 --> 00:18:40,738
Again, just sort of out of. I guess curiosity.

134
00:18:40,978 --> 00:18:48,117
Her curious mind. The head in my bill has an estimate can be close to the same ratio,

135
00:18:48,118 --> 00:18:52,648
standardized to the direct method, the one that uses the weights from the earnings.

136
00:18:53,098 --> 00:19:06,337
Right. And also sort of a voya there are some extensions to estimate includes the Mt. Hansell incidence rate difference,

137
00:19:06,338 --> 00:19:12,958
the cumulative incidence ratio and the difference, but they actually lack statistical efficiency.

138
00:19:13,438 --> 00:19:18,438
So in cohort studies. You might still see them until Hansel Méthode applied.

139
00:19:18,948 --> 00:19:22,398
Mostly when people are using you seems very gracious.

140
00:19:23,288 --> 00:19:34,357
Okay. All right, so let's move to the same method, stratification and pooling and pooling with mental health rates for the odds ratio.

141
00:19:34,358 --> 00:19:41,647
And, you know, maybe we can say a couple of details on a question that was asked before.

142
00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:50,428
I might have been Lindsey or Ana, uh, as to whether you could also standardize the odds ratio, reduce the.

143
00:19:52,068 --> 00:19:57,458
Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Um, I'm sorry.

144
00:19:57,518 --> 00:20:02,718
My memory is weak from. But it's a really good question.

145
00:20:03,528 --> 00:20:09,198
So I guess technically the answer is yes, but in practice that in cities is very rare.

146
00:20:10,368 --> 00:20:17,668
Don't. Because it really needs it can only be done and there that pesky.

147
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:28,108
Rare disease assumption. You remember. That was an assumption we discussed in the context of cumulative sampling of controls and that.

148
00:20:29,618 --> 00:20:36,368
Odds ratio would approximate their cumulative incidence ratio if the disease was rare.

149
00:20:37,598 --> 00:20:44,128
Um. So finding a standardized odds ratios is very rare.

150
00:20:44,188 --> 00:20:51,518
Again, it would be a clunky procedure and this is relevant technically do but in practices.

151
00:20:52,768 --> 00:21:03,928
Not very common. So instead, this is a more sort of straightforward proceeding to wait, set certain specific odds ratios.

152
00:21:05,528 --> 00:21:11,948
And I brought you an example of a case control study of regular oral contraceptives that the exposure.

153
00:21:13,008 --> 00:21:15,768
In the theology of breast cancer, which is dealt.

154
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:24,678
So you can imagine a case control study in which a bunch of people with breast cancer are selected and also.

155
00:21:26,748 --> 00:21:34,578
Some controls without risk. Right. And then they are evaluated with respect to the history of use of oral contraceptives.

156
00:21:35,368 --> 00:21:42,658
So again, for the purpose of that formula, it's helpful to have these arbitrary notation in mind.

157
00:21:43,138 --> 00:21:47,698
Basically, the names of the cells here and this is the total.

158
00:21:50,308 --> 00:21:54,708
Um. A number of people in the case control study.

159
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:59,778
So this is the data from the example.

160
00:22:01,558 --> 00:22:14,438
So you have. An odds ratio of 1.7, which indicates a positive association between oral contraceptive use and breast cancer.

161
00:22:14,588 --> 00:22:23,498
Right. But let's say we actually realize that oral contraceptive use right prior,

162
00:22:23,688 --> 00:22:32,198
that knowledge is much more frequent in people of higher issues than people of lower disease.

163
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:38,578
And it turns out that higher issues may increase incidence of some forms of breast cancer.

164
00:22:39,728 --> 00:22:44,848
It is true. Any social epidemiologist here that might confirm this.

165
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:49,968
Not yet, but okay. I think.

166
00:22:53,578 --> 00:22:54,538
What does that mean.

167
00:22:55,408 --> 00:23:05,488
Well that means that its use could be a confounder its it could learn about the path from oral contraceptive use to breast cancer.

168
00:23:06,498 --> 00:23:17,308
Therefore we don't really know. What is probably unlikely that the Aral linking oral contraceptives with breast cancer have a causal interpretation.

169
00:23:17,318 --> 00:23:21,058
Right. Right. So what could we do?

170
00:23:22,698 --> 00:23:29,508
What do we do first? Stratify.

171
00:23:29,868 --> 00:23:33,788
Excellent. So here I have done this certification for you.

172
00:23:34,918 --> 00:23:38,908
Stratification by, let's say, higher risks and lower risk is.

173
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:50,718
And these are district specific ratios. In the hydroxy is stratum is one point or six in the lower is he is exactly one so.

174
00:23:52,068 --> 00:23:55,308
Is. Oral contraceptive use.

175
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:58,588
Really? Related to.

176
00:24:00,678 --> 00:24:04,828
Responsive music sample. No.

177
00:24:05,908 --> 00:24:10,128
You know, those is pretty much one. So.

178
00:24:10,988 --> 00:24:15,598
So we have confounding and again one option is to just present this.

179
00:24:17,308 --> 00:24:23,487
But another option is to try to put these two odds ratios together in a summary estimate that's weighted.

180
00:24:23,488 --> 00:24:27,088
And that takes into account the confounding effect of.

181
00:24:28,368 --> 00:24:34,998
Yes. Yes. And that's where the Mantle Hansell waiting scheme came in handy.

182
00:24:37,388 --> 00:24:42,658
So. Each stratum is going to be weighted in proportion to.

183
00:24:45,188 --> 00:24:52,698
The product of. Unexposed cases to expose controls are divided by the total number of people in the study.

184
00:24:54,968 --> 00:25:01,428
Right. So we can proceed in the same way as we did with the incidence ratio.

185
00:25:03,278 --> 00:25:07,008
For this stratum. We would multiply.

186
00:25:08,008 --> 00:25:11,758
Uh, ten times 15 and divided by the total. She's 81.

187
00:25:11,878 --> 00:25:14,968
That's 1.85 for Delores years.

188
00:25:15,038 --> 00:25:24,478
And then we multiply 52 times 53 divided by the total to 19, and then we get 12.58.

189
00:25:25,828 --> 00:25:32,968
Again, these are not the weights, he said. Just absolute numbers that we have then to add up to estimate the actual weights.

190
00:25:34,468 --> 00:25:37,617
So here I will read the Eyes of the Mob.

191
00:25:37,618 --> 00:25:41,488
And in fact, they've already divided them by the total sum.

192
00:25:42,268 --> 00:25:47,998
And we get that they wait for the start to miss point 13 and they wait for the law.

193
00:25:48,018 --> 00:25:53,757
This is point 87. And those are the numbers that we are going to multiply this stuff.

194
00:25:53,758 --> 00:26:00,488
Mr. Z because ratios by. Here to obtain this summary weighted.

195
00:26:01,538 --> 00:26:06,908
Well, racial and mental cancelo's racial. That takes into account the confounding effect of.

196
00:26:08,008 --> 00:26:18,908
Is this? Okay. So with the mental hassle incidence rate ratios.

197
00:26:20,978 --> 00:26:28,818
The summary. Mental handsy loss ratio also assumes homogeneity of the stratum specific odds ratios.

198
00:26:30,118 --> 00:26:35,218
You think that's fulfilled here? Yeah.

199
00:26:35,668 --> 00:26:41,288
Yeah, yeah. Pretty similar. You? Yeah. Um.

200
00:26:44,208 --> 00:26:49,578
And that if there are differences, they are only due to random variation in small numbers.

201
00:26:51,728 --> 00:27:00,218
All right. Any questions on this last waiting procedure to obtain a summary measure of association?

202
00:27:03,988 --> 00:27:10,878
Nope. Yes. Oh yeah.

203
00:27:10,908 --> 00:27:17,708
Is he is was a confounder definitely. Definitely those are higher.

204
00:27:22,098 --> 00:27:29,518
Right? Right. Even though they all are in the high risk is is the same as they all are in the lower risk.

205
00:27:29,528 --> 00:27:38,148
Yes, there is confounding because they differ from the and stratified or from the overall.

206
00:27:38,718 --> 00:27:45,438
You remember the overall lower was like 1.7, but the stratum specific was one.

207
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:50,538
So that's confounding. Yeah. Okay.

208
00:27:54,748 --> 00:27:59,118
So let's move in to match. Okay.

209
00:28:01,058 --> 00:28:07,988
So matching, I guess, as they mentioned before, you say conditioning method that's typically implemented at the study design stage,

210
00:28:08,918 --> 00:28:15,398
you could implement that the analysis stage, but it will depend on luck.

211
00:28:18,408 --> 00:28:29,088
She may be scarce these days, and it basically consists of pairing study participants with others that have the same values on the confounders.

212
00:28:30,078 --> 00:28:34,848
Now, the thing is that it depends on the way in which it is done and the.

213
00:28:36,378 --> 00:28:44,078
Implications are different. If you are conducting a case control study or if you are conducting a court,

214
00:28:44,888 --> 00:28:51,208
because as we said before in a court study, you go from outcome that exposure.

215
00:28:52,588 --> 00:28:57,138
In a cohort. So you go from exposure to outcome. Right.

216
00:28:58,548 --> 00:29:05,608
So it's on different. It is most commonly done in case control studies.

217
00:29:07,988 --> 00:29:14,178
And you will find in the literature many. Case control studies that have implemented much.

218
00:29:16,358 --> 00:29:23,058
So this is actually import. It's not sort of a rare kind of thing.

219
00:29:24,288 --> 00:29:28,678
So let's study a little bit matching in case control systems for that.

220
00:29:28,698 --> 00:29:40,378
I brought you a fascinating sample of a study of prostate cancer in relation to history of sexually transmitted diseases or S.T.D.

221
00:29:41,468 --> 00:29:45,128
That was obsessed with molecular methods. So.

222
00:29:46,188 --> 00:29:57,738
It's every time a person gets arrested, there is a sort of molecular mark that's left and that you can measure.

223
00:29:58,128 --> 00:30:01,668
You know, high throughput technology. Right.

224
00:30:04,678 --> 00:30:10,908
So this is the study question, right? The West Indies cause prostate cancer.

225
00:30:12,348 --> 00:30:17,338
But we don't know. I guess that's why I have. With other question mark on top of this error.

226
00:30:20,378 --> 00:30:25,478
Now we go through our literature review and realize that, hey.

227
00:30:26,828 --> 00:30:34,238
H actually. Is closely related to his studies because obviously you know the longer.

228
00:30:35,688 --> 00:30:46,068
The person leaves and I suppose he's sexually active. The more likely it is to hurt the person is to get to the other leg, in this case, men.

229
00:30:47,388 --> 00:30:51,918
And she's obviously also related to prostate cancer.

230
00:30:52,338 --> 00:31:01,958
Closely related, I would say. Which means any potential association between this theory and prostate cancer is confounded by age.

231
00:31:02,418 --> 00:31:11,068
So we have to be very mindful of. Of Asia in a study of a study on prostate cancer.

232
00:31:12,028 --> 00:31:20,148
So let's go back. And please bear with me if you don't like these to the scheme of, you know,

233
00:31:21,598 --> 00:31:28,317
a potential population or an underlying cause here, because you are you have learned so much.

234
00:31:28,318 --> 00:31:33,568
I'm already calling it the study base of prostate cancer in a population.

235
00:31:34,018 --> 00:31:39,987
And anything you can live with that cause this is this study because these represent the study base.

236
00:31:39,988 --> 00:31:46,128
You know there's some time source. Of cases.

237
00:31:48,888 --> 00:32:00,297
So let's say it's a close cohort, if you will, and of men who were 40 to 60 years of age at baseline, these baseline, and they were followed.

238
00:32:00,298 --> 00:32:05,177
And then there was a prostate cancer diagnosis which is represented by the

239
00:32:05,178 --> 00:32:11,028
full circles or a maximum 20 year kind of the administrative and of follow up.

240
00:32:11,298 --> 00:32:23,437
Right. Oh. So because we are interested also on age as a potential confounding.

241
00:32:23,438 --> 00:32:31,898
I have collected data on age at the end of follow up and this is the age in years of each one of these persons at the end of follow up.

242
00:32:32,928 --> 00:32:39,348
If you were to summarize these variables, you could take the mean right.

243
00:32:39,948 --> 00:32:44,388
And if you take the mean, it is 69 years. Okay.

244
00:32:48,368 --> 00:32:56,058
Now we can. And if you were to check if there is confounding.

245
00:32:57,398 --> 00:33:05,258
Okay. Or at least if age is an independent predictor of outcome in this cohort, which is it a precondition for confounding?

246
00:33:05,258 --> 00:33:21,658
Right. What would you do? You're Santa.

247
00:33:22,668 --> 00:33:28,108
You must have the answer. You are smirking. Okay.

248
00:33:28,768 --> 00:33:38,588
Illuminate us. What does the next page say? Exactly.

249
00:33:39,498 --> 00:33:47,808
Precisely. So we could estimate the mean age between people who did get the outcome and people who didn't.

250
00:33:47,988 --> 00:33:52,038
And if they deferred, hey, h you know, might be confirmed.

251
00:33:52,548 --> 00:33:57,158
I need a benefit to the forthcoming Irish study. So this is what's done here.

252
00:33:58,198 --> 00:34:02,298
Some of the cases. They mean 1873.

253
00:34:02,298 --> 00:34:09,018
Among the known cases, the mean age is 67. So is Asian independent predictor of outcome.

254
00:34:10,058 --> 00:34:14,728
Yeah, very possibly. At least that that's a check in our date.

255
00:34:17,558 --> 00:34:22,658
All right. But now let us conduct the case controls.

256
00:34:22,938 --> 00:34:28,918
Because this is what. We are about to study in sort of match.

257
00:34:29,008 --> 00:34:37,828
So I'm going to select all the cases and then I'm going to perform cumulative selection of controls, right?

258
00:34:38,808 --> 00:34:50,628
So I have selected only cases and then I have selected I think yeah, one uncontrolled per case more or less that's the average.

259
00:34:50,998 --> 00:34:55,128
So same number of controls as there are cases, eight cases and eight controls.

260
00:34:55,908 --> 00:34:59,878
Right. Where's the next thing we do?

261
00:35:00,718 --> 00:35:05,618
We want to ascertain exposure status, right? So we take a sample,

262
00:35:05,628 --> 00:35:11,167
a blood sample from all these people and send it to the lab or the lab to tell

263
00:35:11,168 --> 00:35:18,098
us whether according to that biomarker they have and it's like they have.

264
00:35:18,968 --> 00:35:22,158
That sort of molecular. Scar.

265
00:35:23,568 --> 00:35:27,588
All right. And we get the results and these are the results.

266
00:35:27,798 --> 00:35:30,198
So, again, as usual, we do our coding here.

267
00:35:31,068 --> 00:35:40,038
They are exposed, meaning people with a history of SCD appear in the unexposed people without a history of SCD appearing blue.

268
00:35:41,498 --> 00:35:48,328
Okay. We could organize our data on a little two by two table.

269
00:35:48,358 --> 00:35:53,278
You know, the usual thing. And we could do one estimate.

270
00:35:54,168 --> 00:35:59,568
What sort of association? Illustration.

271
00:36:00,528 --> 00:36:06,708
So the odds ratio is the odds of exposure among cases divided by the odds of exposure among controls.

272
00:36:06,708 --> 00:36:10,218
And that's five. Oh, that's a strong association.

273
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:17,778
Right. She might conclude that, well, facilities associate them, whether it's cancer or not, but we don't know.

274
00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:33,788
All right. Now. We could still go and check what the role of Hage is in this selection of cases and controls.

275
00:36:33,808 --> 00:36:39,908
Right. Because in the study, Bass Age was associated with gay status.

276
00:36:40,568 --> 00:36:42,428
How about in the case control study?

277
00:36:43,178 --> 00:36:52,808
So if you take back those ages for these people only and take the mean and compare it between cases and controls, you still find an association.

278
00:36:53,678 --> 00:36:57,428
So meaning these estimates still confounded.

279
00:36:58,798 --> 00:37:02,318
By each. Right. Okay.

280
00:37:03,028 --> 00:37:18,488
And here I brought you the date again. So if we were to apply sort of the, you know, the methods or the procedures that we have been learning so far,

281
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:23,288
our first tendency and these if this is the data is we collected them,

282
00:37:23,288 --> 00:37:30,098
we actually would have no other option but to that's a condition on which to close this bag.

283
00:37:30,238 --> 00:37:36,828
But right. And to do that, we could stratify.

284
00:37:38,188 --> 00:37:41,398
So let's say I stratify by age.

285
00:37:42,538 --> 00:37:46,168
Greater than or equal to 70 years or less than 70 years.

286
00:37:46,648 --> 00:37:52,568
You know, as my attempt to condition. By age and close the backdrop.

287
00:37:54,368 --> 00:38:02,978
And these would be the stratified numbers and you can actually do them with this and take with it wrong or not again.

288
00:38:03,858 --> 00:38:11,478
Um, and then we can estimate. They, for example, set specific odds ratios.

289
00:38:11,478 --> 00:38:15,258
And how about putting them together with the mental ones?

290
00:38:16,098 --> 00:38:25,338
Yes, I knew. Yeah.

291
00:38:25,398 --> 00:38:31,188
It would be related to the literature. It's it's, you know, as this one is made up, but.

292
00:38:31,428 --> 00:38:34,998
Yeah. And in general, you know it guess.

293
00:38:36,488 --> 00:38:39,788
Yeah. It's defined like this. Probably a poor way to.

294
00:38:41,978 --> 00:38:50,708
Two condition. I mean, there's one justification in this particular example, which is that I have relatively few data,

295
00:38:51,728 --> 00:39:00,788
but it must be done based on on what the literature is sort of, you know, at what age, that point.

296
00:39:01,778 --> 00:39:05,278
They? Association between STDs and.

297
00:39:06,598 --> 00:39:09,988
Prostate cancer. Really? Becomes different.

298
00:39:12,848 --> 00:39:18,608
It might be a continuum. We probably need other methods, but for the sake of the example, you know.

299
00:39:19,748 --> 00:39:29,068
So. So again we have to strata and we know how to estimate the summary odds ratio so well.

300
00:39:29,088 --> 00:39:33,827
First we can estimate the odds ratios in each stratum.

301
00:39:33,828 --> 00:39:39,908
So in this stratum of. Men greater than or equal to 70 years of age.

302
00:39:40,238 --> 00:39:46,428
It's actually one. And what happens in this stratum of men.

303
00:39:47,378 --> 00:39:54,028
And there's 70 years. What's the odds ratio? Just a bit of a surprise there.

304
00:39:54,368 --> 00:40:01,448
Hmm. Stephen. There is a problem, Stephen.

305
00:40:02,668 --> 00:40:06,948
Look. Lots of exposure among controls.

306
00:40:07,368 --> 00:40:10,487
Zero there. And what's the number?

307
00:40:10,488 --> 00:40:18,308
Divided by zero? Well, I understand there is there is quite a debate still going on between mathematicians.

308
00:40:19,338 --> 00:40:24,648
So argue that it's infinity. Some others argue that and define.

309
00:40:28,018 --> 00:40:36,838
So I guess I've gone with the undefined guys because, you know, with with these numbers very, very packed.

310
00:40:37,078 --> 00:40:41,968
So when I was telling you about uncertainty of an estimate with small numbers,

311
00:40:41,968 --> 00:40:45,508
this is a really good example and we don't really know what's going on there.

312
00:40:47,538 --> 00:40:53,298
And if you were to actually, you know, sort of just push ahead and estimate the mental,

313
00:40:53,298 --> 00:40:59,418
hence the odds ratio, it would become the same as the odds ratio in this stratum does not define.

314
00:41:00,198 --> 00:41:03,648
So it's one, but that does not really help.

315
00:41:04,098 --> 00:41:08,368
You know, it's extremely uncertain. Um.

316
00:41:10,388 --> 00:41:19,088
So. The reasons for that is that, you know, age in this example is a very strong confounder, very strong confounder.

317
00:41:20,358 --> 00:41:27,048
And I mean so much so that in some strata we get values of zero in some sense.

318
00:41:27,738 --> 00:41:37,278
Therefore, our procedure to control for confounding through stratification and pooling is very inefficient, very imprecise.

319
00:41:40,118 --> 00:41:47,038
In these cases, there is an alternative. Which is to conduct matching.

320
00:41:48,558 --> 00:41:55,308
Before we actually collect the data. So at this stage of the descent and what would this day.

321
00:41:58,818 --> 00:42:02,568
I will see you later. But here I am supposed to read this.

322
00:42:03,888 --> 00:42:07,348
So again. Yeah. When you have a strong confounder.

323
00:42:09,928 --> 00:42:14,518
Pulling on matching bullying and certification becomes inefficient.

324
00:42:16,578 --> 00:42:25,428
You typically have more than one confounder in any study. And if several confounders are strong confounders, the problem is compounded.

325
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:32,868
Just imagine all those very many struggles within levels of confounders and levels of other confounders and so on.

326
00:42:36,108 --> 00:42:40,578
So you could still do what we tried to do that again.

327
00:42:40,668 --> 00:42:45,168
The estimates would be imprecise. So, um.

328
00:42:46,558 --> 00:42:50,398
The solution for that is. Much so.

329
00:42:51,548 --> 00:42:55,358
What would this at the level of design when we are designing this study.

330
00:42:56,798 --> 00:42:59,828
Let's say we pick first our cases.

331
00:43:02,368 --> 00:43:06,838
We know the age. We know the value of the confounder for each case.

332
00:43:07,288 --> 00:43:15,008
Right. And then we are going to select. One control, you can select one for each case,

333
00:43:15,018 --> 00:43:21,198
but making sure that that one control selected for each case has the same value

334
00:43:21,228 --> 00:43:27,138
of the confounder as the case in this example has the same age as the case.

335
00:43:28,018 --> 00:43:33,148
So if we do that are. Cases will be matched to the controls.

336
00:43:33,958 --> 00:43:42,128
When H. And what that procedure does from a structural point of view.

337
00:43:43,168 --> 00:43:48,598
Is it to remove the arrow from the confounder into the outcome?

338
00:43:50,288 --> 00:43:57,848
Why? Because the distribution of the confounder between cases and controls should be exactly the same.

339
00:43:58,208 --> 00:44:05,228
Right. If we are matching each case with a control on exactly the same value or to confound it.

340
00:44:06,208 --> 00:44:10,648
They should be identical. With respect to my use of the confounder on others.

341
00:44:10,688 --> 00:44:13,818
Right. So these arrow is removed.

342
00:44:14,358 --> 00:44:20,438
It is the mechanism, the structural mechanism. Through which matching works.

343
00:44:27,538 --> 00:44:33,978
But no, you know, here is something that's really important, sort of some important.

344
00:44:37,248 --> 00:44:43,958
I hope that from. From my. Working through the examples so far, you have realized that.

345
00:44:45,598 --> 00:44:49,618
The primary motivation. For.

346
00:44:51,008 --> 00:44:56,768
Matching in a case control study is really not controlling for confounding per say.

347
00:44:58,028 --> 00:45:04,328
Why? Because, as they said before, we could still control for confounding, even if we don't do magic.

348
00:45:04,478 --> 00:45:12,528
Right. However, if we did that in these circumstances, our estimate will be imprecise, will be very.

349
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:28,618
Uncertainty. Therefore, in reality, the primary motivation to conduct matching the case control study is in fact to improve efficiency,

350
00:45:28,888 --> 00:45:35,518
to improve precision, to gain in confidence on our estimate rather than.

351
00:45:36,708 --> 00:45:44,018
To control for confounding per se. Obviously when we match we will be controlling for confounding by the matching factor.

352
00:45:44,028 --> 00:45:47,298
Right. But again, that's not the primary motivation.

353
00:45:48,108 --> 00:45:51,438
The primary motivation is to gain precision.

354
00:45:51,888 --> 00:45:55,328
Yeah. That.

355
00:45:56,548 --> 00:46:00,708
With other. So they're going and matching.

356
00:46:02,198 --> 00:46:08,688
It's a good question. So can matching coexist with other methods of conditioning?

357
00:46:08,958 --> 00:46:13,908
The answer is yes. Yeah, great question. So for example, you can match.

358
00:46:14,838 --> 00:46:23,028
I mean, it's quite impossible to match on every single variable that might be a confirmed or in a penetrator vote.

359
00:46:23,598 --> 00:46:31,308
So you might match on a variable or two or three that are very strong confounders.

360
00:46:31,668 --> 00:46:35,478
And for all others, what you don't have a problem of precision.

361
00:46:35,868 --> 00:46:39,168
You can just use regression.

362
00:46:41,778 --> 00:46:51,728
So. Yeah, definitely. Very good question. Right this.

363
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:57,448
Exam level clear. Okay.

364
00:46:59,458 --> 00:47:04,508
So. Let's go back to then square one.

365
00:47:05,848 --> 00:47:10,958
At the level of design implement matching by.

366
00:47:11,828 --> 00:47:24,298
H right. So the idea here is that for each case, we are going to pick a control that has exactly the same value on the.

367
00:47:26,098 --> 00:47:29,248
Going forward. Let's begin with the first case.

368
00:47:30,948 --> 00:47:36,318
The age of this case is 74. So we are going to find.

369
00:47:37,818 --> 00:47:42,498
Somebody among the known cases who is age 74.

370
00:47:44,468 --> 00:47:49,688
And in that instance, these these players, I guess there is no other one.

371
00:47:51,578 --> 00:47:55,608
So this one will become the matched control for this case.

372
00:47:56,498 --> 00:48:07,478
The second one is 80. And this is the only person aged 80 who is not a known case of these becomes the match controller for this case.

373
00:48:08,078 --> 00:48:14,078
Next one is 72. So this is the matched.

374
00:48:15,658 --> 00:48:19,408
Control. There's only 76.

375
00:48:19,468 --> 00:48:22,928
So this is the one. That service is controlled.

376
00:48:24,078 --> 00:48:32,488
78. Yeah. Uh, 70 is one.

377
00:48:33,408 --> 00:48:38,218
68. Huh? There were several 68.

378
00:48:38,368 --> 00:48:41,368
So what do we do? Well, there is. There was at least two.

379
00:48:43,568 --> 00:48:46,868
You could pick one at random. Yeah.

380
00:48:47,948 --> 00:48:52,688
Uh, the last one was 68. So who had was lucky.

381
00:48:54,108 --> 00:48:58,188
Can you use the same control for two cases?

382
00:49:00,878 --> 00:49:05,238
Well, you probably want to avoid that, but. If you could.

383
00:49:06,288 --> 00:49:09,438
There will be statistical consequences that you have to take care of.

384
00:49:10,458 --> 00:49:19,168
Yes. Yeah.

385
00:49:21,398 --> 00:49:25,848
Right. Right. Okay.

386
00:49:26,808 --> 00:49:33,508
So what happens if you don't find an exact match among non cases?

387
00:49:33,528 --> 00:49:41,087
Is that a fair translation of the question? Okay. Well, actually, you may think we rehearsed these bits of it.

388
00:49:41,088 --> 00:49:44,398
We did not. But it's actually great because these.

389
00:49:44,458 --> 00:49:54,017
That's exactly what what what's funny? So what we have done here is called individual matching, which is we have set a very strict rules to our self,

390
00:49:54,018 --> 00:50:02,118
which is that the person needs to have an exact value of the confounder to serve as a match.

391
00:50:03,618 --> 00:50:12,818
But let's say if there is a chance that we may not find too many people with that condition, there is another type of matching.

392
00:50:13,778 --> 00:50:25,608
Which is called frequency match. Which consists of finding a control from a group with values within a narrow range that includes the case's value.

393
00:50:27,488 --> 00:50:34,158
In other words. We would be matching one day distribution of the confounded rather than on the exact value.

394
00:50:34,718 --> 00:50:42,698
So obviously, you know, the condition in the control for confounding might be a little bit imperfect with frequency matching,

395
00:50:43,298 --> 00:50:49,768
but in some instances, you know, it's our only option and there are different types of frequency matching.

396
00:50:49,778 --> 00:50:53,548
One is called the caliper matching. Right.

397
00:50:55,188 --> 00:50:58,438
Uh, which you said. Sort of a slippery. Yeah.

398
00:50:59,428 --> 00:51:03,538
That that bridge. Right. So in this case, for example.

399
00:51:05,738 --> 00:51:09,248
You have this person who's 74. We could.

400
00:51:11,158 --> 00:51:15,058
Take whomever is within, let's say, two years.

401
00:51:16,648 --> 00:51:28,788
Of 74. So these would be the people who none cases were within two years of 74, and we would pick one by chance drunk.

402
00:51:36,078 --> 00:51:39,448
Because it's more imperfect. Yes. Very smart.

403
00:51:40,038 --> 00:51:44,468
Yeah. Um, but, you know, I guess it's a really good question.

404
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:47,808
I can resist the temptation of simulating that.

405
00:51:48,688 --> 00:51:55,938
Um hmm. You know, my sense that perhaps on average might be about the same.

406
00:51:57,278 --> 00:52:02,128
Uh. Because you have very large numbers.

407
00:52:02,128 --> 00:52:10,198
Your matches will always. What would tend to be baked at the center of the distribution.

408
00:52:11,308 --> 00:52:15,718
But yeah, I don't know. I mean, in theory, yes, you are absolutely right.

409
00:52:15,808 --> 00:52:19,938
Very good question. All right?

410
00:52:20,618 --> 00:52:31,898
Mm hmm. So for this person, for example, that the caliper could be could include these two people who are within two years of age, etc.

411
00:52:32,468 --> 00:52:36,608
But let's go back to our example on individual matching, which was this.

412
00:52:37,838 --> 00:52:44,458
And then. Let's remove everybody else.

413
00:52:44,458 --> 00:52:52,018
And we've only tests and controls and let's send the samples for analysis and a statement of exposure.

414
00:52:53,788 --> 00:52:58,168
Just go to the Mac. We can build our two by two table and.

415
00:53:00,198 --> 00:53:04,788
Estimate our new odds ratio and we get notes ratio of 2.8.

416
00:53:07,198 --> 00:53:12,538
That does raise a should be adjusted for confounding by age.

417
00:53:13,678 --> 00:53:19,588
Because the distribution of age in cases and known cases should be exactly the same.

418
00:53:21,548 --> 00:53:26,418
73 and 73. They are identical with respect to age.

419
00:53:27,188 --> 00:53:31,508
Aha. But you must be wondering why is it what?

420
00:53:32,678 --> 00:53:48,998
Huh? Well. If you compare these averages with the study base averages, they differ at least among the known cases.

421
00:53:50,608 --> 00:53:55,798
And is that okay? With respect to how you should select controls.

422
00:53:57,248 --> 00:54:01,548
Can you sleep at night with this situation? No.

423
00:54:02,348 --> 00:54:06,928
Why? Right.

424
00:54:07,348 --> 00:54:17,938
There must be buyers like because the controls should represent the distribution of every variable really in the study base.

425
00:54:18,238 --> 00:54:21,898
Right, let alone the exposure. That's the more important.

426
00:54:23,968 --> 00:54:32,608
So if she's associated with exposure and a selection of controls is different from the study base.

427
00:54:33,118 --> 00:54:36,148
You bet. You have also messed up with the exposure.

428
00:54:37,418 --> 00:54:42,998
So the selection of exposure is unlikely to be independent of.

429
00:54:45,108 --> 00:54:49,118
Selection of controls is unlikely to be independent of exposure status.

430
00:54:51,308 --> 00:54:57,918
So. Matching has introduced selection bias.

431
00:54:59,698 --> 00:55:03,948
And this is always the case. This happens by design.

432
00:55:04,898 --> 00:55:09,008
So the important thing is that we as epidemiologists and.

433
00:55:10,598 --> 00:55:19,778
You know, study implementers and designers are aware that if we are going to do a much case control study by design from the outset,

434
00:55:19,778 --> 00:55:22,298
we are going to be introducing selection bias.

435
00:55:27,978 --> 00:55:33,978
So they match cases and controls may be more similar to each other with respect to exposure risk status,

436
00:55:34,278 --> 00:55:42,378
because we have made them similar with respect to a factor, the matching factor that is related to exposure.

437
00:55:46,398 --> 00:55:51,108
You. We want us to work through that again.

438
00:55:53,828 --> 00:56:01,698
By matching. Let's say. People with prostate cancer and people without prostate cancer by age.

439
00:56:03,218 --> 00:56:07,808
In a study where you. Want to examine the effect of these.

440
00:56:10,348 --> 00:56:13,408
You have made the control order.

441
00:56:15,098 --> 00:56:22,858
Then there are known cases in the study was. Was they, as well as you'd expected, association between age and steady.

442
00:56:24,788 --> 00:56:28,748
Older age more extreme. If you make your controls older.

443
00:56:31,478 --> 00:56:38,258
Would they have? Would you expect them to have modestly or less than the study of Boris?

444
00:56:39,958 --> 00:56:43,978
Right now if history does have an effect on prostate cancer.

445
00:56:45,288 --> 00:56:51,268
Then. The cases should have also more received than the controls in the study.

446
00:56:52,048 --> 00:56:58,978
By now you have made your controls in the case control study more similarly with respect to a study through matching by age.

447
00:57:00,028 --> 00:57:03,748
Because this study leads to. Because age leads to a study.

448
00:57:08,088 --> 00:57:11,688
That clearer. I happy to go through it again.

449
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:22,677
Yeah. So you have made cases and controls more similar to each other with respect to

450
00:57:22,678 --> 00:57:29,708
exposure by matching on the factor that's associated with both exposure and outcome.

451
00:57:31,878 --> 00:57:35,718
So this. Odds ratio is wrong.

452
00:57:37,038 --> 00:57:41,118
This was race also biased because you haven't taken into account.

453
00:57:44,648 --> 00:57:50,628
The fact that. Well, you marched. So what to do?

454
00:57:51,138 --> 00:57:55,188
You have to correct the odds ratio for the match. And how do you do that?

455
00:57:55,788 --> 00:58:00,288
Well, first, let me reorganize the data here in a different way.

456
00:58:02,168 --> 00:58:09,788
So I have here just listed the pairs of cases and controls the matching.

457
00:58:09,788 --> 00:58:12,578
The value of the matching factor is in parentheses.

458
00:58:12,908 --> 00:58:22,148
And then here I am representing whether each one for each pair with the case or the control were exposed or unexposed.

459
00:58:23,828 --> 00:58:28,418
Exposed is a red plus and exposed is a blue minus.

460
00:58:29,408 --> 00:58:41,468
Okay. So as you can see for the first pair, which is this person, this person and the person.

461
00:58:42,398 --> 00:58:50,018
Right. The case is exposed and the control is also the control is also exposed.

462
00:58:50,618 --> 00:58:54,188
So this is why they appear represented like this. Okay.

463
00:58:55,368 --> 00:59:01,448
And while you can certainly. Check all others.

464
00:59:09,958 --> 00:59:18,448
So the way the reason why I represented this data like this is because in reality.

465
00:59:19,398 --> 00:59:27,138
Each pair or match set is actually exactly equivalent to a stratum in an unmatched stratified analysis.

466
00:59:28,278 --> 00:59:34,938
So basically we could treat again each better stratum and summarize.

467
00:59:35,828 --> 00:59:38,868
The data using the mental handsy outreach.

468
00:59:41,668 --> 00:59:46,788
Isn't that super cool? I find it very, very, you know, very interesting.

469
00:59:48,638 --> 00:59:53,608
So recall that in case control studies, you know, this was the format,

470
00:59:53,618 --> 00:59:59,408
this was that the layout, which is the more important detail here is the layout of the table.

471
01:00:00,808 --> 01:00:10,498
And again, if you were to stratify and note ratio in this case into or a study into bears,

472
01:00:11,488 --> 01:00:17,428
you will have to buy two tables, but in each to like the table, there would only be two people, right?

473
01:00:18,488 --> 01:00:24,218
Because each table represents a pair. Each stratum represents a much.

474
01:00:25,398 --> 01:00:35,728
Control to a case to people. And they are they not only for possible layouts of that thing we just two people.

475
01:00:36,858 --> 01:00:41,398
And I'm calling them here. Layout A, B, C and D.

476
01:00:43,168 --> 01:00:46,738
So for example in this layout that represents.

477
01:00:48,028 --> 01:00:56,418
One case control much better. Both the case and the control are exposed.

478
01:00:57,138 --> 01:01:08,368
Yeah. And the other says will be zero because that strategy has to be in this lay out be the case.

479
01:01:08,998 --> 01:01:15,868
Case is exposed and the controls unexposed in layout C the case would be unexposed

480
01:01:15,868 --> 01:01:21,538
and the control exposed on the lay of the both case and control will be.

481
01:01:22,718 --> 01:01:26,488
And. So.

482
01:01:27,808 --> 01:01:33,158
I have just carried him over here, but. If you were.

483
01:01:36,688 --> 01:01:40,018
You can count as did you have a stratified.

484
01:01:41,258 --> 01:01:49,508
You're much case control study by bears. You can count how many pairs represent each one of these.

485
01:01:50,528 --> 01:02:04,827
SAT. Okay. And let's let's assume that the number of pairs representing each of those layouts is called A for layout,

486
01:02:04,828 --> 01:02:09,148
a, b for layout b, c for layout C and D for the.

487
01:02:10,378 --> 01:02:15,348
If you are to apply the mental Hansell formula. Do those layouts.

488
01:02:17,818 --> 01:02:24,438
You will find out that some of them. Cancel out because they have zeros in the numerator.

489
01:02:25,008 --> 01:02:29,768
Right. All these only ones that have zeros in the middle to cancel.

490
01:02:30,948 --> 01:02:43,858
And what you are left with is that. The mental Hansell loss ratio is simply the ratio of the number of pairs.

491
01:02:44,458 --> 01:02:48,118
We've layered B over the number of pairs we labeled C.

492
01:02:51,628 --> 01:03:03,458
So if we move up. These babies represent, in other words, the number of Estrada case control pairs that are discordant on exposure.

493
01:03:03,518 --> 01:03:13,358
In other words, there is in which the control is exposed, the case is unexposed, or the case is exposed in controlled settings for this Court.

494
01:03:14,078 --> 01:03:15,998
The older peers are uninformative.

495
01:03:20,858 --> 01:03:29,528
And if we go back to our example and now we can only focus on the B and C, because this will only would be the only from it.

496
01:03:29,708 --> 01:03:35,018
Which ones, which one or which of these pairs represent York B.

497
01:03:36,648 --> 01:03:43,608
Expose cage meat with unexposed control. Two, five and seven.

498
01:03:44,058 --> 01:03:48,998
Right. And how about seen? Three.

499
01:03:49,838 --> 01:03:55,358
So the and yet this is real meet this is three and latency is one.

500
01:03:55,928 --> 01:04:00,488
So the mental hence the loss ratio is three divided by one of three.

501
01:04:01,698 --> 01:04:08,388
Hmm. Now, this is also sort of at some level important.

502
01:04:09,618 --> 01:04:15,328
But the way to summarize. A table of matched.

503
01:04:16,398 --> 01:04:25,068
A match case control study is different from the usual table in which we summarize case control studies of that and matched.

504
01:04:25,818 --> 01:04:31,098
And these would be the way in which you have to lay out the numbers.

505
01:04:31,668 --> 01:04:35,598
You the numbers on your cells are the number of pairs.

506
01:04:36,668 --> 01:04:42,728
Not the number of cases or controls. So what this table is telling you is that there are two.

507
01:04:43,738 --> 01:04:47,038
Various in which both case and control are.

508
01:04:48,198 --> 01:04:51,838
Supposed. There are two areas in which.

509
01:04:52,798 --> 01:04:58,048
Both cases and controls are unexposed. And then these are the discordant pairs.

510
01:05:01,488 --> 01:05:06,258
So I had a pull here. But unfortunately we are running out of time.

511
01:05:06,258 --> 01:05:09,588
So perhaps if you don't mind, let's just run these.

512
01:05:10,558 --> 01:05:18,598
More quickly. How does the naive regime that ignored matching compare with the enhanced illustrations?

513
01:05:22,058 --> 01:05:29,018
You can even just go back to your notes and. What was the naive odds ratio in this example?

514
01:05:35,468 --> 01:05:39,768
It was actually 2.8. They went over which I put the scope.

515
01:05:40,838 --> 01:05:45,128
That's the knife search. And where's the mental hassle adjusted odds ratio?

516
01:05:46,188 --> 01:05:53,548
History. So what is the answer to this question that can be generally. So the naive odds ratio is.

517
01:05:55,198 --> 01:06:03,088
Attenuation. Compared to the true odds ratio that takes into account selection bias, which is three.

518
01:06:03,898 --> 01:06:11,168
And what can be the reason for that? Is the same that they explained twice.

519
01:06:13,538 --> 01:06:16,988
Was the reason the naive Audrey Hughes and a teenage.

520
01:06:20,708 --> 01:06:23,798
Because with the neighborhoods ratio we have,

521
01:06:24,008 --> 01:06:33,278
an eight of ratio is calculated in a situation where we have made by design cases and controls more similar to each other with respect to exposure.

522
01:06:34,758 --> 01:06:39,948
So then it should be closer to what they are similar to respect with respect to exposure.

523
01:06:40,128 --> 01:06:50,048
Know it's going to be harder to actually see an association. Can we estimate the association between the matching factor and the outcome?

524
01:06:53,198 --> 01:07:01,018
Can we estimate in our example? After matching by age where their age is related to prostate cancer.

525
01:07:17,128 --> 01:07:23,178
On this. I'm going to wait for some volunteers. Maybe I should volunteer somebody.

526
01:07:24,448 --> 01:07:31,998
Digitally using my first digit. Come on, guys.

527
01:07:32,008 --> 01:07:36,808
You say yes or no. It's okay. It's all right. Nobody's going to scold you or anything.

528
01:07:48,328 --> 01:07:56,578
Yes. Of. Exactly.

529
01:07:56,758 --> 01:08:04,558
The answer is no, because we have made the distribution of the matching factor exactly the same for cases and controls.

530
01:08:04,588 --> 01:08:10,498
It's impossible to examine an association between the matching factor and the outcome in much case controls.

531
01:08:10,918 --> 01:08:16,568
Yes, he was in hard. I know you are just a little shy.

532
01:08:16,598 --> 01:08:29,268
That's okay. I'm Shane myself. Can we assess interaction between the matching factor and the exposure?

533
01:08:31,928 --> 01:08:42,428
So. I mean, to assess interaction, you just need to.

534
01:08:45,308 --> 01:08:55,378
However distribution of the viral. That's somehow related to the distribution of the exposure.

535
01:08:56,428 --> 01:09:01,298
And that is perfectly possible because you have in much by exposure, you have only match by outcome.

536
01:09:01,768 --> 01:09:06,718
So the answer to this is yes. You can assess interaction in the multiplicative scale, though,

537
01:09:07,408 --> 01:09:13,708
there is a little formula to assess interaction in case control studies in the additive scale,

538
01:09:13,708 --> 01:09:19,078
but it requires a number of assumptions and I'm not getting into that. So in the multiplicative scale, for sure, yes.

539
01:09:20,798 --> 01:09:27,288
So this is a summary. Matching Case Control Studies introduces bias by design.

540
01:09:27,888 --> 01:09:32,028
This bias must be corrected in the analysis or the odds ratio will be wrong.

541
01:09:33,328 --> 01:09:39,868
Okay. Therefore once matched, an analysis must always take matching into account.

542
01:09:40,438 --> 01:09:42,628
And how do you recognize that?

543
01:09:42,628 --> 01:09:49,798
If you are reading critically a study of a matched case control study, the one thing you want to look for, first of all,

544
01:09:49,798 --> 01:09:56,668
is whether the analysis took matching into account and how do you know that you should find in the

545
01:09:56,938 --> 01:10:03,538
description of the analysis things like we conducted stratified analysis using mental handsome weights,

546
01:10:03,898 --> 01:10:10,018
or we used match pairs analysis, or we used something called conditional logistic regression analysis.

547
01:10:10,018 --> 01:10:15,448
Conditional is the cue. Okay. I'm sorry.

548
01:10:16,098 --> 01:10:22,628
This is. This should be in your lights. I just uploaded it a little bit late today, but should be.

549
01:10:23,608 --> 01:10:27,268
All right. Now, how about matching gold?

550
01:10:27,608 --> 01:10:30,928
Just a few words. It's relatively rare. But.

551
01:10:30,968 --> 01:10:36,298
But in some fields of biology, we are now using it more frequently, for example.

552
01:10:36,448 --> 01:10:42,208
But you need a little analogy. We are conducting what's called sibling control studies.

553
01:10:42,988 --> 01:10:47,518
And they are basically matched cohort studies.

554
01:10:48,798 --> 01:10:56,747
And the motivation to do matching in cohort studies is there say to control for

555
01:10:56,748 --> 01:11:00,978
confounding is that different from the motivation in case control studies.

556
01:11:02,148 --> 01:11:12,288
Yes. Because in case control studies, we say it ad nauseum that the motivation was to improve efficiency, not to control for confounding person.

557
01:11:12,618 --> 01:11:17,328
So in cohort studies, yes, our motivation is to control for confounding.

558
01:11:19,758 --> 01:11:24,768
And the big difference, obviously, is that because in a covered study, we don't know anything about the outcome.

559
01:11:25,038 --> 01:11:27,588
The matching is done with respect to exposure.

560
01:11:28,618 --> 01:11:38,068
So we pick somebody who's exposed and then for that person we pick somebody unexposed who has the same value on the confounder as the exposed.

561
01:11:39,478 --> 01:11:47,508
All right. So the mechanism is obviously also different because by matching an exposure

562
01:11:48,078 --> 01:11:53,328
we are removing the incoming error into the exposure from any lurking virus.

563
01:11:53,448 --> 01:11:58,548
Right. So again, this is similar to the mechanism in a randomized trial.

564
01:11:59,568 --> 01:12:03,888
Um. I'm matching all that. Then I'm conditional exchange ability.

565
01:12:05,378 --> 01:12:10,678
Of course. And their dissemination of conditional accessibility within levels of the confines.

566
01:12:14,728 --> 01:12:20,938
Now another big difference. As opposed to much case control studies.

567
01:12:22,608 --> 01:12:27,098
In March. Cohort studies. If you ignore.

568
01:12:28,288 --> 01:12:31,608
Matching in the analysis. Nothing happens.

569
01:12:32,728 --> 01:12:38,558
That. Your estimates of association are not going to be biased.

570
01:12:41,418 --> 01:12:48,108
However, if you do account for the matching, it would improve again, precision or your certainty.

571
01:12:48,179 --> 01:12:56,229
The agent actually covered down the line, but. Okay.

572
01:12:56,829 --> 01:13:15,519
Any questions so far? Yes. If if, if the nested case control study Thursday is not much, you should not have to worry.

573
01:13:16,609 --> 01:13:20,478
But if in addition to the matching in the cohort study,

574
01:13:20,479 --> 01:13:26,689
you matched the cases to controls in the nested case control study, you still have to take into account the selection.

575
01:13:28,159 --> 01:13:38,739
So these are two different levels. Now in a march cohort study, can we examine the association between the matching factor and the outcome?

576
01:13:39,069 --> 01:13:47,439
Yes, because we are not matching on ALK and even if the distribution of the effect of the

577
01:13:47,439 --> 01:13:52,389
matching factor is being forced somehow to be related to the distribution of exposure,

578
01:13:53,139 --> 01:14:00,519
the outcome should happen proportionally in the same way between people with and without the matching factor

579
01:14:01,089 --> 01:14:07,389
as it would in a situation in which we have enforced that distribution to follow that of the exposure.

580
01:14:10,399 --> 01:14:16,489
Can we assess the interaction between the matching factor and the exposure in a matched cohort study?

581
01:14:17,039 --> 01:14:23,169
Yes. No problem. All right.

582
01:14:24,339 --> 01:14:27,539
Used to wrap up. Advantages of matching.

583
01:14:27,779 --> 01:14:32,578
Sometimes you may be the only strategy to guarantee some control for confounding when

584
01:14:32,579 --> 01:14:36,209
a strong confounder produces such imbalance in the composition of study groups.

585
01:14:36,539 --> 01:14:43,099
The judgment through other ways may not be possible. You have those zero cells.

586
01:14:46,019 --> 01:14:50,759
May increase statistical efficiency of this study if it's done on many strong confounders.

587
01:14:53,089 --> 01:14:58,818
Now individual matching is logistically straightforward in some situations with the secondary

588
01:14:58,819 --> 01:15:03,799
study based because secondary study based tend to be very large like people in a city,

589
01:15:04,309 --> 01:15:08,249
right? So you have a lot to choose from.

590
01:15:11,499 --> 01:15:18,218
Matching these advantages, matching several confounders may make it difficult to find a match control for a given case because

591
01:15:18,219 --> 01:15:24,489
you would need to find somebody who has the same values on very many variables as the case,

592
01:15:25,389 --> 01:15:29,559
it might be hard to find one who has the same variable, the same value on one variable.

593
01:15:29,949 --> 01:15:35,259
Imagine if you have to find somebody who has the same value on ten variables.

594
01:15:35,649 --> 01:15:39,009
Sometimes matching is done. It's going to be tough.

595
01:15:41,809 --> 01:15:47,689
And then associations between the matching factors and the outcome cannot be studied in case control studies.

596
01:15:48,529 --> 01:15:54,529
Although it is possible to evaluate multiplicative interaction between the matching factors and the exposure.

597
01:15:56,049 --> 01:16:07,909
No. The last disadvantage will be for less because the distribution of the matching factors among controls does not represent the study base.

598
01:16:09,229 --> 01:16:17,749
The transport, stability or generalizability of your odds ratio is going to be limited meaning.

599
01:16:18,869 --> 01:16:27,509
The size of the association in your matched case control study may not be translated into a to a different population.

600
01:16:28,989 --> 01:16:33,789
Because that different population might have a different distribution of the matching factors.

601
01:16:37,299 --> 01:16:42,489
And then if the associations between the matching factor and the exposure or the outcome are weak.

602
01:16:43,969 --> 01:16:52,499
You will not gain a lot of efficiency. So I guess that that might be good for a sort of final comment on that.

603
01:16:53,459 --> 01:16:57,229
You know, if you are going to do matching, it's in a case control study.

604
01:16:57,239 --> 01:17:02,308
You should really make sure that you will match for a variable that's actually confirmed it

605
01:17:02,309 --> 01:17:07,889
and you will only know that from your careful study of the literature or prior knowledge.

606
01:17:08,849 --> 01:17:16,499
If you do matching on a variable that's really not a relevant or strong confounder, you will lose precision.

607
01:17:17,819 --> 01:17:20,629
And then you'll have to correct for bias, possibly.

608
01:17:22,579 --> 01:17:30,979
Also, you should never match on a variable that could be on the causal path from exposure to outcome.

609
01:17:31,399 --> 01:17:40,759
If you are interested in estimating the total effect of the exposure on the outcome, if you do that, you will incur another bias over a judgment bias.

610
01:17:40,759 --> 01:17:44,299
And we will study very carefully on Monday.

611
01:17:45,569 --> 01:17:49,229
I know you can hardly wait. But you should still enjoy the week.

612
01:17:50,129 --> 01:17:52,559
All right. Any other. Any question?
